ad85897925e4,"My approach will pay off eventually, says Kemi Badenoch",,"My approach will pay off eventually, says Kemi Badenoch Kemi Badenoch: ""I was elected to do exactly what I am doing now"" Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch has said there may be a ""price to pay"" in the opinion polls but insisted her approach to changing her party would ""pay off eventually"". Speaking to the BBC's Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg, Badenoch argued that unlike Labour and Reform UK she wouldn't ""rush out"" new policies and would instead take ""time to get it right"". She acknowledged that the Conservative Party may take a ""small"" political hit for the strategy but said: ""Nothing good comes quickly."" As her party's conference kicks off in Manchester, Badenoch is facing questions about her first year as leader which has seen the party perform poorly in the polls and in local elections . The party has been losing support to Reform, and some former Conservatives MPs - and one current one - have defected to Nigel Farage's party. Asked if Reform had stolen the Conservatives' thunder, Badenoch said: ""Reform rushed out an announcement on indefinite leave to remain - they hadn't done the actual work. ""All of a sudden lots of Europeans with settled status didn't know what was going to happen to them. ""I make sure that when I announce something I think about how it is going to impact people. ""Winning elections without a plan is what got us into trouble, it is why Labour is floundering and that is what Reform will deliver. ""I said I want to do politics differently - doing it differently means being patient and taking our time to get it right."" Speaking to the same programme, Conservative Mayor of Tees Valley Lord Ben Houchen, said the party should have got ""our show on the road much sooner than we have"" and added that ""a space"" had been created for Reform to ""steal a march"". ""We need to start to pull our socks up... start to communicate better and start to outline what a positive Conservative Party can deliver for this country."" In the build-up to the conference, the Conservatives have released a string of policies including an intention to repeal the Climate Change Act, leave the European Convention on Human Rights and a plan to remove 750,000 illegal immigrants. Badenoch told Laura Kuenssberg there were ""too many people in our country who should not be here"". Asked where the people being deported would be sent to, Badenoch said: ""I'm tired of us asking all of these irrelevant questions about where should they go. ""They will go back to where they should do or another country, but they should not be here. ""We cannot have a situation where we cannot deport people, we don't know where they will go so they can stay here. ""That is basically inviting every single person across the world to our shores because we don't know where they would go after. That is a defeatist attitude and I will not have that."" In a later interview with GB News, Badenoch said that MPs who did not agree with leaving the ECHR would not be able to stand as a Conservative candidate. She said party members could have different views but added: ""If you want to be a Member of Parliament as a Conservative, then you need to understand that leaving the ECHR is a manifesto commitment.""",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c1l81766g2qo,politics,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/2510/live/e99ea350-a1d1-11f0-928c-71dbb8619e94.jpg,2025-10-05T10:07:37.609000+00:00,73ab04a6a56f1ef7da737d836d2f28803c05a16a
2e2fe331eaca,Police to get broader powers to restrict repeated protests,,"Police to get broader powers to restrict repeated protests Shabana Mahmood: ""This is not about a ban, it's about restrictions and conditions"" Police forces will be granted powers to put conditions on repeat protests, the government has announced, a day after nearly 500 protesters were arrested . Senior officers will be able to consider the ""cumulative impact"" of previous protests, the Home Office said, which could mean they instruct organisers to hold events elsewhere if a site has seen repeated demonstrations. Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood told the BBC's Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg programme the move was not a ban on protests but ""about restrictions and conditions"". Organisers of Saturday's protests, against Palestine Action being made a proscribed terror organisation, had been urged to postpone them after two men were killed in an attack at a synagogue in Manchester. Police forces had warned resources would be stretched, with officers across the country offering additional support to hundreds of synagogues and Jewish community sites. The new powers will be ""brought forward as soon as possible"", the Home Office said. Currently, for police to ban a march entirely, there needs to be a risk of serious public disorder. But under the new rules, where there have been repeated protests, police could impose conditions such as requiring it to be held elsewhere or on the duration of events. Mahmood said that while the right to protest is fundamental ""this freedom must be balanced with the freedom of their neighbours to live their lives without fear"". Large, repeated protests could leave sections of the country, particularly religious communities, ""feeling unsafe, intimidated and scared to leave their homes"", she added. This had been particularly evident within the Jewish community recently, she said. She told Laura Kuenssberg she was ""very worried about the state of community relations in our country"". ""I know I, as the home secretary, have a responsibility to think about the action the government can take to strengthen our communities, to make sure people are well-integrated into our society,"" she said. The home secretary will carry out a review of current protest legislation to ""ensure powers are sufficient and being applied consistently"", the government said. This will include powers to ban protests outright, the government said. Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch backed the new powers but questioned why it had taken so long and said the government must prove it had the backs of Jewish people. ""We believe in free speech but that has to be within the bounds of the law, if protests are used to intimidate, to incite hatred then that is not protest,"" she told Kuenssberg. Kemi Badenoch says the government 'must prove to Jewish people it has their back' Asked about the protests Mahmood said: ""I think just because you have a freedom doesn't mean to say you have to use it at every moment of every day, those people could have just waited a day or two and given people the chance to grieve and process what has happened."" Most of those arrested at protests on Saturday were held on suspicion of supporting the proscribed group Palestine Action. Organisers Defend Our Juries said around 1,000 took part in demonstrations around Trafalgar Square against the ban on the group and opposing Israel's actions in Gaza. Following the Home Office announcement on protests the group posted on social media accusing the government of ""silencing opposition"" and ""authoritarianism"". Hundreds of people have been arrested since the group was outlawed by former home secretary Yvette Cooper in the summer, predominantly for holding signs saying they support Palestine Action. Israel has repeatedly denied that its actions in Gaza amount to genocide and that its actions are justified as a means of self-defence following the 7 October 2023 Hamas attack. But last month the world's leading association of genocide scholars said that Israel's conduct meets the legal definition as laid out in the UN convention on genocide . The arrests have been criticized by human rights group Amnesty International, which said arresting people for ""peacefully sitting down and holding these signs"" was not a job for the police. Watch: Activists applauded their fellow protesters as they were detained Organisers of Saturday's protest, Defend Our Juries, had been asked to reconsider their plans following the killing of two men at the Heaton Park Hebrew Congregation synagogue on Yom Kippur - the holiest day in the Jewish religious calendar. But organisers said in a statement beforehand it hoped police ""choose to prioritise protecting the public from real terrorism, and not waste resources on enforcing the absurd and ridiculous ban on Palestine Action"". Adrian Daulby and Melvin Cravitz were killed after Jihad Al-Shamie drove a car into people outside synagogue in Manchester. Al-Shamie then tried to force his way into the building before being shot dead by armed police. Three others were injured in the attack. Several arrests have been made in relation to the attack and Mahmood said four people remained in custody on Sunday morning. The home secretary will write to chief constables on Sunday to encourage them to use all their powers to prevent and respond to public disorder, as well as thanking them for their response following Thursday's attack. Police forces are working with the Community Security Trust, a charity which works to protect Jewish people from terror and antisemitism, to reassure the Jewish community, the home office said. On Sunday, the Board of Deputies of British Jews is holding a commemorative event ahead of Tuesday's second anniversary of the 7 October attacks on southern Israel, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage. The group has welcomed the government's move to increase police powers and described recent protests as ""deeply irresponsible and offensive"".",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c24rmdngrrjo,politics,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/c914/live/2fffa270-a1cf-11f0-928c-71dbb8619e94.jpg,2025-10-05T10:11:29.865000+00:00,df12e1a78af097241c429bffa847cfdf530123d5
e9f909e4722b,"Tories pledge to remove 750,000 migrants under borders plan",,"Tories pledge to remove 750,000 migrants under borders plan Paul Seddon Political reporter, Conservative Party Conference, Manchester Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch: ""They'll go back to where they came from"" The Conservatives say they would task officials with removing 750,000 illegal immigrants within five years, under Trump-style deportation plans. Under plans unveiled as its annual conference begins, the party has pledged to ban people who enter the UK without permission from ever claiming asylum. It would also prevent those whose claims are rejected from challenging decisions in the courts, with appeals instead handled by Home Office officials. Border officials would be instructed to remove people ""within hours or at most a few days"", the Tories say, with a reformed ""Removals Force"" unit seeing their funding doubled to £1.6bn per year. It comes as Tory activists gather in Manchester for their annual party conference, amid dire poll ratings under leader Kemi Badenoch and questions over how they can head off a potentially existential challenge from Nigel Farage's Reform UK. In the run-up to the four-day gathering, the party has already said it would end the UK's 75-year membership of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) in a bid to thwart asylum appeals, confirming a widely-expected policy shift. Under the latest proposals, the Home Office's immigration enforcement unit would be rebranded as a ""Removals Force"" and given wider-ranging powers, along with an extra £820m per year the Tories say could be unlocked by closing asylum hotels. The party says it would give the new unit a ""mandate"" to remove at least 150,000 people each year, totalling 750,000 during the five-year lifetime of a Parliament. This would include people currently living in the UK illegally, the party says, as well as future illegal arrivals and all foreign nationals convicted of a crime more serious than minor parking or speeding offences. It would represent around a five-fold increase from the 35,000 migrants who were removed from the UK over the last year - the majority of whom went voluntarily. Visas threat The Tories say people would be deported to their home country if possible, or to ""safe"" third countries that would agree to take them. Like Reform, the party says it would negotiate returns agreements with other nations, and threaten to withhold aid spending and visas from countries that decline to co-operate. Speaking to the BBC's Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg programme, Badenoch said illegal migrants should ""go back to where they came from"". But pressed repeatedly to set out where people would go, she did not name particular countries, branding the question ""irrelevant"", adding that concerned voters were ""not interested in these sorts of questions"". 'No need for lawyers' The party says it wanted to take inspiration from the US, where President Trump has handed immigration enforcement officers sweeping new powers to arrest and deport undocumented migrants. The Tories say they would instruct police forces to check the details of everyone they arrest against biometric borders data, and would be allowed to use facial recognition without informing the public it is in use. It plans to expand an unspecified ""existing facility"" to detain migrants before they are removed, with a capacity for between 1,000 and 2,000 people. The party also plans to restrict the grounds for claiming asylum to those facing a threat from the government in their home country, excluding claims from those fleeing conflict or ""less tolerant"" laws on religion or sexuality. Key to their proposals is a plan to abolish the Immigration Tribunal, which hears challenges to failed asylum claims, handing the appeals process instead to a team of officials within the Home Office. The Tories also plan to abolish taxpayer-funded legal aid in immigration cases, with a document on the proposals arguing there ""will be no need for lawyers"" because claims would be ""fairly assessed against the criteria"". ECHR divide The Conservatives' plan comes after Reform UK made similar pledges over the summer to take the UK out of the ECHR and deport 600,000 migrants within five years if it won power. Badenoch sought to portray her party's plans as more credible, adding that it was backed by ""comprehensive legal analysis"" in the form of a review by Tory peer and former justice minister Lord Wolfson of Tredegar. ""Reform have nothing but announcements that fall apart on arrival,"" she added. The Tory move to leave the ECHR creates a key dividing line with the Labour government, which has opted against leaving the treaty but is reviewing how it is applied in UK law. Labour has also pledged tougher action to deal with small boat crossings over the English Channel, which are set to break record numbers this year. Labour recently set out plans to lengthen refugees' route to permanent settlement in the UK in a bid to make the country less appealing to migrants, and has negotiated a ""one in, one out"" pilot scheme with France. Unlike Reform, the Tories are not promising to formally disapply the Refugee Convention, a 1951 treaty that prevents signatory countries from returning refugees to countries where they face serious threats to their life or freedom. But the party says it would legislate to prevent courts having regard to it in asylum cases, with a pledge to leave if ""activist judges attempt to override Parliament"".",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c708g5x2yqzo,politics,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/51dc/live/637c5ed0-a1d0-11f0-928c-71dbb8619e94.jpg,2025-10-05T09:50:00.189000+00:00,f91cf706e5c8f293267f61775811521b2928ef09
e796b8833e23,"UK will leave ECHR if Tories win election, Badenoch says",,"The Conservatives will take the UK out of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) if they win the next election, Kemi Badenoch has announced. The announcement comes after a review by the Conservative party's lead lawyer found staying in the ECHR blocks migration reform and leads to the persecution of military veterans. Last year Badenoch said leaving the treaty would not be a ""silver bullet"" for tackling immigration, but on Friday argued the move was necessary to ""protect our borders, our veterans, and our citizens"". Labour said the Conservative leader had adopted ""a policy she argued against"" because she is ""too weak to stand up to her own party in the face of Reform"". The announcement on the eve of the party's conference in Manchester will settle the party's position following months of internal divisions. The ECHR had become a focal point in the Conservative Party's immigration debate, with senior figures arguing that its provisions have obstructed efforts to deport foreign criminals and failed asylum seekers. Announcing plans to leave marks a sharp shift in Conservative policy and will likely become a central theme of the party's election campaign. It comes amid growing pressure from Reform UK, which has already pledged to leave the ECHR. Badenoch said: ""I have not come to this decision lightly, but it is clear that it is necessary to protect our borders, our veterans, and our citizens. ""I have always been clear that we should leave the ECHR, if necessary, but unlike other parties we have done the serious work to develop a plan to do so – backed by legal advice from a distinguished King's Counsel."" The announcement comes after detailed legal review led by shadow attorney general Lord Wolfson of Tredegar concluded that the ECHR placed ""significant constraints"" on the government. The review, set up by Badenoch in June, tested how international law impacted five key Conservative policy proposals: deporting foreign criminals and illegal immigrants, protecting military veterans from legal action, prioritising British citizens in access to public services, ensuring prison sentences reflect parliamentary intent, and preventing courts using climate change laws to block planning reforms. “In all the five policy areas, the ECHR places significant constraints,"" Lord Wolfson found. This week, Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said the government would look again at how international laws including the ECHR were interpreted by UK courts - to stop unsuccessful asylum seekers blocking their deportation on the grounds they could be sent to worse prisons or healthcare systems. Sir Keir told the BBC he did not want to ""tear down"" human rights laws, but said mass migration in recent years meant there needed to be a change. Legal experts have warned leaving the ECHR would carry serious political and legal consequences. Catherine Barnard, University of Cambridge professor of EU Law, has noted withdrawal would isolate the UK alongside Russia and risk breaching both the Good Friday Agreement and the UK-EU trade deal. But Lord Wolfson's nearly 200 page legal advice reportedly found that alternative domestic attempts to soften the impact of the ECHR rules would be ineffective. He also said withdrawal would not breach the Belfast (Good Friday) Agreement or the Windsor Framework. A Labour Party spokesperson said the decision had been ""forced on"" Badenoch, and not been ""thought through"". ""Badenoch now thinks she is both incapable of negotiating changes to the ECHR with our international partners, and a sufficiently accomplished diplomatic operator to renegotiate the Good Friday Agreement."" Conservative shadow Home Secretary Chris Philp said the ECHR had ""enabled foreign criminals and illegal immigrants to stay in the UK"", adding: ""Protecting our borders is non-negotiable."" During previous debates on immigration, moderate conservatives have expressed concern about leaving the ECHR. In 2023, ex-deputy prime minister Damian Green said leaving the ECHR was a ""red line"" for the One Nation Tories group he chaired. More recently, Boris Johnson's justice secretary Sir Robert Buckland said leaving the ECHR would be an act of folly - calling instead for reform from within. Both Green and Sir Robert lost their seats in the 2024 election and no longer sit in Parliament. A Reform UK spokesman said ""nobody trusts a single word"" the Conservatives said. ""The Conservatives had 14 years in government to leave the ECHR. Since then, it's taken them 14 months to even decide what their policy is,"" the spokesman said. ""The Conservative Party is finished."" The Liberal Democrats seized on Tory splits, telling ""former One Nation Conservatives who have been abandoned by their party's lurch to the extremes: you have a home with us"", Lib Dem leader Sir Ed Davey said by leaving the ECHR ""Kemi Badenoch has chosen to back Nigel Farage and join Vladimir Putin"". ""This will do nothing to stop the boats or fix our broken immigration system – problems caused by the last Conservative Government that Badenoch still hasn't apologised for,"" he added.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c1mxy2j2elro,politics,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/299f/live/f343b7e0-a098-11f0-a918-e111dd54869c.jpg,2025-10-04T11:04:17.343000+00:00,07cfd5216d41317f402b98fc9c2dd27eaebf4642
b84bb637818f,Starmer tells protesters to 'respect grief of British Jews',,"Starmer tells protesters to 'respect grief of British Jews' Suzanne Leigh and Ben Hatton Getty Images Keir Starmer and his wife, Victoria, visited the scene in Manchester on Friday morning Sir Keir Starmer has said pro-Palestinian protests planned for this weekend will cause ""distress"" and urged those thinking of taking part to ""recognise and respect the grief of British Jews"" after Thursday's synagogue attack. ""It is not a time to stoke tension and cause further pain,"" the prime minister wrote in the Jewish News and the Jewish Chronicle. A leader of the Community Security Trust (CST) charity, which provides security for the Jewish community, told the BBC it was ""phenomenally tone deaf"" to be ""taking police resources away from protecting the rights and freedoms of Jewish people"". But a spokesperson for protest group Defend Our Juries said: ""Cancelling peaceful protests lets terror win."" Pro-Palestinian protests are taking place in both London and Manchester on Saturday. The leaders of both the Metropolitan Police and Greater Manchester Police have said covering protests will stretch resources at a time when police have deployed extra officers to synagogues and other Jewish buildings to offer protection and reassurance. The prime minister's comments came after Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood called for demonstrators to ""step back"" and give people a chance to grieve. She said there were ""strong"" powers to protect the freedom to protest, but they could be overridden on the advice of the police. ""I can take my lead from the police, if they were to tell me there was an inability to respond and to police the protests, then there are powers that are available,"" she added. In an article for the Jewish News and the Jewish Chronicle published on Friday, Sir Keir said: ""Peaceful protest is a cornerstone of our democracy – and there is justified concern about the suffering in Gaza – but a minority have used these protests as a pretext for stoking antisemitic tropes. ""I urge anyone thinking about protesting this weekend to recognise and respect the grief of British Jews this week. This is a moment of mourning. It is not a time to stoke tension and cause further pain."" Met Police Commissioner Mark Rowley said he did not have the powers to prevent protests or ask the home secretary to do so but questioned whether they should proceed. ""There's a risk the timing of that event sends a message which, whether inadvertently or deliberately, endorses antisemitism, which is a deep risk to community tension,"" he said. The Met has written to the protest group Defend Our Juries, raising concerns about the amount of police resources its planned protest would divert at a time when ""visible reassurance and protective security"" was needed for communities. But the group, which has led demonstrations against the ban on Palestine Action, said it planned to go ahead with the march. Dave Rich, director of policy at CST, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""For so many people who claim to care about human rights and care about freedoms, to be taking police resources away from protecting the rights and freedoms of Jewish people to live their lives and go to synagogue in safety, all to support a proscribed terrorist organisation, which is not the same thing as supporting the Palestinians. The two are not the same. ""And I think it's remarkably self absorbed and insensitive to say the least."" Defend Our Juries member, Sir Jonathon Porritt, told the BBC that he had ""no doubt"" that ""everyone taking part in the silent vigil today will demonstrate huge respect and real grief for those affected by the absolute atrocity at Heaton Park."" He told Radio 4's Today programme: ""I do not think that means that we should be asked to give up on our right to stand up for those who are being devastated by an ongoing, real-time genocide in Gaza."" He added those taking part ""would have the deepest concern about growing levels of antisemitism"". The group has urged the Met to ""prioritise protecting the community, rather than arresting those peacefully holding signs"" in support of Palestine Action. The government proscribed Palestine Action under anti-terrorism legislation in July. At various protests since then, hundreds have been arrested for showing support for the group , which has won permission to challenge the ban. The Met will deploy 1,500 officers to arrest anyone breaking the law by overtly supporting the group. Greater Manchester Police Chief Constable Sir Stephen Watson appealed for those intending to protest in the city this weekend to ""consider whether this is really the right time"". He said his force would not seek to stop peaceful gatherings, but said police would immediately act to curtail any acts of violence or intimidation. A spokesperson for Greater Manchester Friends of Palestine, which is planning a demonstration in the city's Cathedral Gardens on Saturday, said: ""Because we recognise the sensitivity of the local situation, there will be a Jewish speaker who understands what both communities are going through."" The CST's Mr Rich also told the BBC that politicians and wider society have allowed antisemitism to flourish in the UK. ""There are a lot of people who could step up and do better,"" he said. He added: ""If people knew how much, how many people went online every single day to talk about killing Jews, they'd be absolutely horrified."" ""More broadly, across civil society and across parts of industry, there is an inability to recognise antisemitism or a reluctance to deal with incitement in ways that have just allowed it to grow."" A pro-Palestinian protest took place in Manchester on Thursday night. Demonstrators in London protesting against the Israeli navy halting a flotilla carrying aid to Gaza clashed with police too. The Metropolitan Police said 40 people had been arrested. Six of those detained were arrested for assaults on police officers. Home secretary calls pro-Palestine protests after Manchester attack ‘un-British’ Shadow home secretary Chris Philp told the BBC on Saturday: ""I don't think these protests should go ahead at all. I think it's extremely insensitive to the Jewish community."" He added: ""We cannot allow this atmosphere to develop where a particular community, in this case the Jewish community, are intimidated."" Green Party leader Zack Polanski said on Friday ""non-violent protest has a really important part to play in our democracy"". ""I think it's important in democracy we find space and we find nuance that people can both grieve and people can protest for the people that they are grieving and all of these things can be true at the same time,"" he told the BBC. The UK's chief rabbi Sir Ephraim Mirvis said on Friday that many members of the Jewish community wondered why marches in support of Palestine Action had been allowed to take place. ""Some of them contain outright antisemitism, outright support for Hamas. Not every single person, however there is so much of this, which certainly is dangerous to many within our society,"" Sir Ephraim told Radio 4's Today programme. ""You cannot separate the words on our streets, the actions of people in this way, and what inevitably results, which was yesterday's terrorist attack.""

c2f5d01e6446,"Tax wealthiest to end rip-off Britain, says Green leader",,"Tax wealthiest to end rip-off Britain, says Green leader Kate Whannel Political reporter Green Party leader of England and Wales Zack Polanski:  'We will make sure that the very wealthiest pay more tax' Newly-elected Green Party leader Zack Polanski has told his party's conference a tax on the wealthiest would end ""rip-off Britain"" and make the country ""an affordable"" place to live. Addressing members in Bournemouth, he said taxing the assets of the richest 1% would enable the government to fund universal free childcare, special needs education and rural bus routes. He also defended migrants and refugees to loud applause from the audience and accused Labour of being ""handmaidens"" of Reform UK adding: ""When Farage says jump, Labour asks 'how high'."" Polanski has described himself as an ""eco-populist"" and is seeking to shift the party to the left to take on Sir Keir Starmer's Labour Party. The prime minister has sought to tighten immigration controls in recent months, in what is being seen by critics as a response to Reform leading national opinion polls. But Sir Keir launched an attack on Reform leader Nigel Farage in his Labour conference speech this week, accusing him of sowing division and not believing in Britain - something denied by Farage. Polanski described Farage as a ""Trump-loving corporate stooge"" and accused Sir Keir of jumping to his tune. Unusually for a speech by a Green Party leader, Polanski did not focus primarily on the environment. He told the conference: ""You can not be an effective environmentalist without talking about the deep inequality in our society."" Much of his speech centred on the problems posed by the cost of living, pointing to a rise in homelessness, tenants worried about their rent and families struggling to pay bills. Polanski argued that the country's problems were ""rooted in an economic model built on austerity and privatisation"" but that the Green Party would ""break the shackles of poverty and hardship that lock so many in"". ""This is a country with so much going for it, but we have been failed time and time again by a political class poisoned by extreme wealth and you can see that poison everyday."" ""A country where a tiny few have taken our power and wealth. Things must change. It's time to take it back."" He said some voters might worry that they could be hit by taxes on the wealthiest being proposed by his party. ""Hairdressers and plumbers say understandably 'I've worked hard all my life. Why are you taxing me? Why are you taxing my ambition?'"" However, Polanski said he was targeting people who ""will make more money in one night than everyone in this room could probably earn in an entire year"". In a 20 minute speech, Polanski told the conference his party's ""horizons"" would not be ""narrow"" and that he would ""not be silent"" on ""the mass slaughter in Palestine"". ""We must stop selling arms to Israel, we must stop sharing intelligence,"" he said. He also criticised what he called a ""draconian crackdown on the right to protest"". ""From terrorist proscription against protesters, to banning journalists from their conference, to diving into a rushed evidence-free plan for digital IDs that are likely to discriminate against minorities - the alarm bells of authoritarianism are now ringing."" In his defence of refugees and migrants, Polanski said it was the ""economic system"" that was a ""threat to the places we love... not people arriving small boats"". To loud cheers from party members he declared : ""We'll say it loud, we'll say it clear migrants and refugees are welcome here."" He said the Greens wanted to stop small boats crossing the Channel through ""safe and legal routes"". He also blamed ""a politics that tries to divide us and points the finger at each other, instead of at billionaires"". In a contrast with comments from Sir Keir earlier this year, who said the UK risked becoming an ""island of strangers"", Polanski said: ""This is a nation of neighbours."" He said defending migration was important to him because of his own ""confused and muddled"" Jewish ancestry, which saw his family flee from Latvia to Ukraine to Poland and eventually to England. Taking a moment to mark Thursday's attack on a synagogue in Manchester, where Polanski grew up, he said ""my heart is with the community."" In the past year the Green Party has built on its success at the 2024 general election - when it won four MPs - by winning 74 seats in the local council elections. Last month, Polanski was overwhelmingly backed by members in a leadership contest against the less combative duo of Green MPs Adrian Ramsay and Ellie Chowns. Since the election the party says its membership has risen by 20% to an all-time high of 80,000. Polanski, who is a member of the London Assembly but does not have a seat in Parliament, has expressed interest in working with the new party being set up by former Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn and former Labour MP Zarah Sultana. Speaking after the leadership election, he said it was ""too soon to talk about joining electoral coalitions"", but he was interested in working with ""anyone who wants to challenge a failing Labour government and take on fascism and the far right"".",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c708y9nq174o,politics,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/ae45/live/a0ba2130-a061-11f0-928c-71dbb8619e94.jpg,2025-10-03T15:51:35.614000+00:00,134dcec18ec417562e56e66eb70cb815d00c1415
06292036e75e,Green deputy leader defends comments on Leeds rabbi,,"Green Party deputy leader Mothin Ali has defended his criticism of a Leeds-based Rabbi and Israeli Defence Force (IDF) reservist. Rabbi Zecharia Deutsch had accused Ali of playing a key role in the wave of threats that drove him from his home. Green leader Zach Polanski has been under pressure to take action but is standing by his deputy. Speaking to the BBC, Ali called for Rabbi Deutsch and ""anyone who participates in a genocide"" to be investigated by the police. Ali described the death of two Jewish people in an attack at a synagogue in Manchester on Thursday as ""an absolute tragedy"" and expressed solidarity with the Jewish community. In September, The Times newspaper reported that Rabbi Deutsch left his Leeds home under advice from West Yorkshire police following a deluge of threats linked to his work with the IDF. Speaking to the Times, Rabbi Deutsch blamed Ali, who is a member of Leeds City Council, for playing a key role in amplifying the attacks through his posts on social media. The Times reported that Rabbi Deutsch had been working as a student chaplain at Leeds University at the time of the 7 October attacks in 2023. An Israeli citizen, he was called up as a reservist for a tour of duty with the Israel Defence Forces. Rabbi Deutsch reportedly acted as a guard for food and ammunition convoys entering Gaza during his service. In one video on a now private social media account, Ali said: ""Leeds University should be protecting its students against this kind of animal. ""You should be protecting people. You should be protecting students from this kind of animal, because if he's willing to kill people over there, how do you know he's not going to kill your students over here?"" Ali has not disputed the content of the video when asked by the BBC. He said: ""I think anyone who participates in a genocide is a danger and should be investigated by the police. ""I don't believe that British people, people who enjoy the freedoms of this country, should be able to go into a foreign state and participate in genocide."" Separately, Ali apologised for the ""short sightedness"" of a post he made the day after the 7 October attacks, where he said ""indigenous people have the right to fight back"" and called for an end to ""white supremacist European settler colonialism"". Speaking to the BBC, Ali argued he had not been referencing the Hamas attack on Israeli civilians - killing about 1,200 people and taking 251 hostages. He reiterated that the post referred to principles ""enshrined in international law"" and was not directly linked to the events of that day. Defending his position, Ali said he had been elected as deputy leader by more than 5,000 Green Party members who ""put their trust in me because they recognise that I work for our community as a whole"". ""Politicians have a responsibility in how they communicate, but also the media have a responsibility in how they communicate,"" he added. ""We shouldn't conflate what's happening in Israel to British Jews her - I think that is irresponsible. ""We need to express our solidarity with British Jews in this country, we need to express our solidarity with all marginalised communities in this country."" Ali became a councillor for Gipton and Harehills ward in May 2024 and immediately hit the headlines for his victory speech, labelling his election a ""win for the people of Gaza"" before shouting ""Allahu Akbar"", meaning ""God is the greatest"" in Arabic. He later apologised for ""any upset"" caused. Green Party leader Zack Polanski stood by Ali in an interview on the morning of the party's annual conference, saying his views needed to seen in context that ""this Rabbi went off to fight for the IDF, he was actively recruiting for people to engage in a genocide"". Speaking on BBC Radio 4s Today programme Polanski said Ali was right to apologise, but he would ""defend his right to be annoyed and upset by what is happening in Palestine"". ""We need to have a nuanced conversation about what is a genocide and talk about what is actually happening as opposed to the words that people use.""",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c33ryml4y5ko,politics,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/0998/live/92c14460-a051-11f0-928c-71dbb8619e94.jpg,2025-10-03T15:43:16.628000+00:00,f3ca54bc97dab002e9dfe73b4e1baf059529c335
f847db0a6371,"Reform Send system now or face billions in extra costs, ministers warned",,"Reform Send system now or face billions in extra costs, ministers warned Kate McGough Education reporter BBC Supporting children with special educational needs and disabilities (Send) in England will cost the government an extra £3bn a year by 2029 if the system is not reformed, a think tank has warned. The government is already spending £12bn this year on supporting those with Send, a figure that has risen by 66% in the last decade. Under current projections, there will also be an extra 220,000 children and young people with education, health and care plans (EHCPs) by 2029, the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) says. A spokesperson for the Department for Education (DfE) says the IFS report is ""further evidence of the broken Send system this government inherited"". A rise in the number children receiving Send support in schools has driven what the IFS calls a ""dramatic and ongoing"" increase in spending. ""The truly shocking thing is that despite this increase in spending, we are still left with a system that is failing to cope with the needs of these children and young people,"" Pepe Di'Iasio, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said. One in five pupils (1.7 million) in England get some kind of support for special educational needs in school at the moment. And 482,000 of them (or 5.3% of all pupils) get the higher level of support from individual EHCPs, a legal document setting out a child's tailored support needs, which councils have to provide and pay for. The rising costs of Send support have forced local authorities into hundreds of millions of pounds of debt . A government agreement meant councils have been able to keep Send deficits off their financial books, and now there are calls for the total debt - which is forecast to reach £5bn next year - to be wiped completely. Amanda Hopgood, of the Local Government Association, says that would ""put councils on a stable financial footing"", as well as addressing ""outdated legislation that leaves councils facing rising and unsustainable costs"". Munira Wilson, the Liberal Democrats' spokesperson on education, says councils have been ""pushed to the brink"", adding that ""vulnerable young people are being set up to fail"". The IFS is predicting that the proportion of pupils with EHCPs will rise even further in the next four years, to 8% of all pupils aged four to 16. In July, the government refused to rule out scrapping EHCPs as part of their upcoming reforms. Education minister Georgia Gould has since said ""there will always be a legal right to additional support"", adding that children, families and teachers will be ""at the forefront"" of Send reforms. Currently, the first £6,000 of Send support comes from school budgets - but costs above that in mainstream schools, and the full costs of support in special schools, are covered by councils. Educating children in special schools is significantly more expensive than in mainstream settings. The average cost of funding one place at a state special school is £23,900 per year, or £61,500 per year for an independent special school. The government wants more early intervention and more Send pupils to stay in mainstream education . Angela Mawer, grandmother and legal guardian to seven-year-old Colby, says she felt like she had ""won the lottery"" by finding him a place in mainstream education which could cater to his needs. ""It's really sad that I should have to feel like that,"" she said. ""There isn't enough provision for children like Colby."" Family handout Angela is now looking for a suitable place in a specialist school for her grandson Colby Colby has spent three years at Littlecoates Primary Academy in Grimsby, in a council-funded and specially-resourced part of the school called Launchpad, which provides dedicated areas for Send support within mainstream schools in the area. Colby will soon need to move on to a more specialised setting to continue his education, but Angela says he has ""come on leaps and bounds"" during his time there. There are 12 spaces at the Littlecoates Primary Launchpad site for Send pupils in reception up to Year 2. Most are offered a place by the council after struggling in mainstream schools, or not being able to find a school place that will meet their needs. The aim is to help children adjust to mainstream classes with short-term support from specialist staff. It's been running for three years, with 100 more places planned for schools across North East Lincolnshire. Seven-year-old Finley has managed to successfully integrate into a Year 2 class with the support of Launchpad. Simply joining in with his classmates' phonics practice was something his mum Claire says she ""didn't dare to dream could happen"". ""Getting to the point where Finley has made all this progress, I could burst with pride,"" she says. Family handout Claire says most mainstream school staff do not have the training to deal with the needs of children like her son Finley But Claire says most mainstream schools have got a long way to go before they can properly support Send pupils. ""The government needs to put a lot of work into ensuring mainstream settings can meet children's needs,"" she says. ""I don't feel like mainstream staff have got the right training to be able to deal with some of the special needs of the children."" Kate Cowdroy, who runs Launchpad, says children can make ""phenomenal progress"" with the right support, even if some have to go on to a specialist setting. ""The reality is a lot of schools haven't got funding like this available to them,"" she says. ""Some of the children they're putting in mainstream classrooms, they're setting them up to fail on a daily basis."" The DfE says ministers have ""not hesitated to take action"" to make changes to the Send system, adding that they ""will continue engaging closely with children, parents and experts as we develop plans to ensure all children get the outcomes and life chances they deserve"".",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/czjv2rk9yjvo,politics,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/ba9d/live/3620ae20-9f8a-11f0-a934-075243299099.jpg,2025-10-03T08:16:55.044000+00:00,1c39ad748e65a2bab37eb9bc3e6b5546c64cc62a

Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch said Mone should be stripped of her peerage after a firm linked to her, PPE Medpro, was ordered to repay £122m for breaching a Covid contract. In a letter to Badenoch, the Scottish entrepreneur said she would not return to the Tories ""assuming there still is a Conservative Party before the next election"". Mone was made a peer by Prime Minister David Cameron in 2015, but took a leave of absence and lost the Tory whip following the PPE revelations. The Conservatives said in December 2023 that she was no longer a member of the party. However, this was later disputed by Mone. The party said she was ""formally written to"" on Thursday and told that she would not be accepted back as a Tory if she ever returned to the Lords. Getty Images Kemi Badenoch said the PPE Medpro case was enough to strip Mone of her peerage In her letter to Badenoch, Mone said there ""seems to be a bit of amnesia"" about her loss of the whip, suggesting that she removed it herself when she chose to go on leave. Mone continued: ""You will be pleased to hear that once I do clear my name, I have no wish to return to the Lords as a Conservative peer. ""That's assuming there still is a Conservative Party before the next general election."" Badenoch was among several politicians, including Chancellor Rachel Reeves, who called for Mone to relinquish her peerage after the High Court judgment. Getty Images Mone and Doug Barrowman have been married since 2020 On Thursday, Badenoch told BBC News that what she had heard from the case against PPE Medpro was ""enough"" for her to be stripped of her title . She added: ""I want to make sure that people can see that the Conservative Party is a party of integrity. ""That's why we removed Michelle Mone. ""And it's very, very important that people see that politicians, whether they're in the Commons or in the Lords, are acting above board."" A party spokesman added: ""Under Kemi Badenoch's leadership, the Conservative Party expects parliamentarians to maintain the highest standards, and on this Baroness Mone has fallen well short."" Can a peerage be removed? Peerages can only be removed by an act of Parliament. The SNP have called for the UK government to take that step . PPE Medpro, which was set up by a consortium led by Mone's husband, Doug Barrowman, was awarded lucrative contracts to supply 25 million medical gowns to the NHS during the pandemic. However, the equipment has been in storage since 2020 after the company failed to prove it was correctly sterilised. Mone described the court ruling as ""nothing less than an establishment win for the government in a case that was too big to lose"".

bd4f93cb6325,Green leader Zack Polanski backs legalisation of all drugs,,"Green leader Zack Polanski backs legalisation of all drugs Charlotte Wright Political Editor, South East PA Media Green Party leader Zack Polanski spoke to Charlotte Wright ahead of the party's annual conference in Bournemouth The leader of the Green Party says he wants to legalise all drugs, calling for an approach ""led by public health experts, not politicians"". Speaking to BBC South East ahead of his party conference, Zack Polanski said he agreed with a Kent Green councillor, who earlier this year called for the legalisation of all drugs, including class A drugs like heroin and crack cocaine. Polanski said ""the war on drugs has absolutely failed, and ultimately we need to be having a public health approach"". When asked about implications of this for the taxpayer, he replied, ""Well, I think voters are having to pay right now for a crime that happens, for the fact that people are in the illegal drug markets, for gangs that we see across county lines. ""All of this is a failure of the fact that, again, for far too long, Prime Ministers have stuck their heads in their sand and said, if we just make drugs illegal, everything's going to be okay."" The Green Party of England and Wales is gathering in Bournemouth for their first autumn conference under a new leadership team which also consists of deputy co-leaders Mothin Ali and Rachel Millward, the current deputy leader of Wealden District Council. The party has seen growing success in local council elections in parts of Kent Sussex and Surrey in recent years, including in previously Conservative-voting areas like Wealden, Reigate and Maidstone. Modelling himself as an ""eco-populist"" during the recent leadership election, Polanski was seen to have a more radical, left-wing approach. It was argued by his opponents that this might alienate the more moderate, former Conservative party voters who had turned to the party over issues like protecting green spaces from housebuilding. The leader rejected this idea when speaking to BBC South East. He said: ""I think the radical thing for people in the South East is the fact that their wages have not gone up, but their bills have gone up, the fact that they can't get an NHS dentist appointment. ""The fact that it feels like there's no real future or opportunities for young people. ""So I don't actually think what I'm offering is radical. What I'm offering, I think can appeal to almost everybody."" Polanski remains clear that his party wants to ""tax multi-millionaires and billionaires"" in order to create a fairer society. ""This is about redistributing the excess wealth that is happening right across the South East and England and Wales, and saying, let's put that money back into our communities,"" he said. The leader discussed a myriad of other issues, including defence and the party's general election prospects. When asked whether the former Conservative voters now with the Green Party would support his ambition for the UK to leave NATO, Polanski stressed that the UK needs ""a different approach to defence"". He said: ""What I'm talking about there is recognising we can't be in hock to Donald Trump. ""What I want to do is have a conversation about what an alternative alliance looks like with our European neighbours."" This would not ""necessarily"" mean spending more on defence, Mr Polanski added. Turning attention to the next general election, the Green leader has previously said he thinks his party can win 30-40 seats. When it come to the South East he says other seats in Brighton will be ""first on the list"", with the party hopeful of adding to the Brighton Pavilion it has held since 2010. Polanski said: ""I think the fact that Sian Berry has such an incredible success, in Brighton Pavilion shows that a lot of the seats around there suddenly get into play. ""That doesn't rule out other seats too.""",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c20e20rzje2o,politics,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/3ff8/live/d714a830-9fa9-11f0-bcf9-91615bda46dc.jpg,2025-10-03T09:32:09.534000+00:00,e9b0c03c2d2840fbb81c9c79c733a4d35f0dcc78
66f0921e99f3,Tories pledge to scrap landmark climate legislation,,"The Conservatives have pledged to scrap the UK's landmark climate change legislation and replace it with a strategy for ""cheap and reliable"" energy. The Climate Change Act 2008, which put targets for cutting emissions into law, was introduced by the last Labour government and strengthened under Tory PM Theresa May. Tory leader Kemi Badenoch said her party wanted to leave ""a cleaner environment for our children"" but argued ""Labour's laws tied us in red tape, loaded us with costs, and did nothing to cut global emissions"". Environmental groups said the move would be an act of ""national self-harm"", while Labour said it would be ""an economic disaster and a total betrayal of future generations"". Conservative ex-prime minister Baroness Theresa May criticised the decision as a ""retrograde step which upends 17 years of consensus between our main political parties and the scientific community"". ""To row back now would be a catastrophic mistake for while that consensus is being tested, the science remains the same,"" Baroness May added. The 2008 law, which was passed when current Energy Secretary Ed Miliband was in the same role in Gordon Brown's government, committed the UK to cutting carbon emissions by 80% by 2050. In 2019, under May's premiership, this legally binding target was updated to reaching net zero by 2050 - meaning the UK must cut carbon emissions until it removes as much as it produces. The legislation also established the Climate Change Committee, which advises the government on meeting the target and reports on progress towards reducing emissions. At the time, the law passed through Parliament with the support of all major parties. However, the political consensus on net zero has since fragmented. Badenoch has previously said the target of net zero by 2050 is ""impossible"" for the UK to meet and promised to ""maximise"" extraction of oil and gas from the North Sea . Reform UK has also said it would scrap net zero targets if it wins the next election , blaming the policy for higher energy bills and deindustrialisation in the UK. The UK was the first country to establish a long-term legally binding framework to cut carbon emissions, and since the act was passed many other countries have introduced similar legislation. However, the Tories said the act forced ministers ""to make decisions to meet arbitrary climate targets, even if they make the British people poorer, destroy jobs, and make our economy weaker"". The party argues that the 2008 law has ""forced successive governments to introduce punitive measures that have hit family finances"". As an example, it pointed to fines for boiler manufacturers who do not hit heat pump sales targets, which critics have branded a ""boiler tax"". The scheme, announced but then delayed by the previous Conservative government, came into force under Labour in April. The UK has high electricity costs, ranking the fourth highest for domestic consumers of medium usage when compared to other EU countries, and the highest for industrial usage. Labour says its plan to boost clean energy in Britain will reduce household energy bills by ""up to £300"" by 2030. However, earlier this year energy bills rose by 6% for a typical family. Badenoch said: ""We want to leave a cleaner environment for our children, but not by bankrupting the country. ""Climate change is real. But Labour's laws tied us in red tape, loaded us with costs, and did nothing to cut global emissions. Previous Conservative governments tried to make Labour's climate laws work - they don't. ""Under my leadership we will scrap those failed targets. Our priority now is growth, cheaper energy, and protecting the natural landscapes we all love."" However, Miliband said: ""This desperate policy from Kemi Badenoch if ever implemented would be an economic disaster and a total betrayal of future generations. ""The Conservatives would now scrap a framework that businesses campaigned for in the first place and has ensured tens of billions of pounds of investment in homegrown British energy since it was passed by a Labour government with Conservative support 17 years ago."" Former Conservative minister Lord Alok Sharma, who was president of the Cop 26 UN climate summit in 2021, said the last Conservative government had a legacy of ""global leadership"" on tackling climate change and urged Badenoch not to ""squander this for the sake of short-term political expediency"". The Liberal Democrats also criticised the announcement. The party's energy security and net zero spokesperson Pippa Heylings said: ""The reality is that investing in renewables is the greatest economic growth opportunity in this century and will protect the planet for future generations."" Meanwhile, Richard Benwell, chief executive of the Wildlife and Countryside Link coalition of environmental groups, said: ""The real route to lasting security is in homegrown clean power, not burning more fossil fuels. ""Without binding climate law, ministers will be free to trade away our future - and it is nature and the poorest communities that will pay the price.""",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/czrp2k3m3deo,politics,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/752b/live/bb9f6640-9ef4-11f0-b1c8-5d59c9f3a032.jpg,2025-10-02T16:21:23.593000+00:00,3b38645165d96877bb8286fa27d0f09d9add6367

The posts implied Reform's Caerphilly candidate, Llŷr Powell, had links to Vladimir Putin - an accusation the party firmly denies. They also referred to bribes taken by a former Reform leader . Newyddion S4C has been told the letter was sent under the Defamation Act 2013 and the Representation of the People Act 1983. The Defamation Act protects individuals from false statements that damage their reputation, while the Representation of the People Act sets strict rules on false claims during election campaigns.

In an interview with BBC News NI, she said: ""The last time I checked, Northern Ireland did vote to leave."" Northern Ireland voted by 56% to 44% in favour of staying in the EU in the 2016 referendum, which saw the UK overall vote to leave by a majority of 52% to 48%.

'The best of both worlds' Badenoch was speaking ahead of her party's annual conference this weekend. She has been the Tory leader for almost 12 months after her party lost the 2024 general election to Labour. Asked how her party was good for the union, after it had delivered the controversial post-Brexit Irish Sea border, which left Northern Ireland under different trading arrangements than Great Britain, Badenoch replied: ""Last time I checked Northern Ireland voted to leave (the EU)."" When told that Northern Ireland voted to remain in the EU, she replied: ""I do recognise the people of Northern Ireland voted to remain and we came up with a settlement - it wasn't perfect, but it tried to make sure we had a way of Northern Ireland getting the best of both worlds."" 'Under new leadership' Badenoch also said she was ""deeply concerned"" by Labour's efforts to repeal and replace the last Conservative government's Troubles Legacy Act , legislation that was widely criticised in Northern Ireland. She defended her party's stance, adding: ""We went through a lot of pain to get to the point where we could deliver it. ""When you speak to veterans a lot of people were affected, I think they're worried that again and again, decisions are being made by politicians but they are the ones being held accountable for them."" The Troubles (Legacy and Reconciliation) Act was passed by the Conservatives and had been criticised for including a conditional amnesty. It was strongly opposed by many victims groups and all political parties in Northern Ireland.

Two members of the Jewish community were killed and four were left in a serious condition in the attack during worship to mark Yom Kippur at the Heaton Park Hebrew Congregation synagogue in the north of the city. Greater Manchester Police's (GMP) Chief Constable Sir Stephen Watson confirmed worshippers and security staff helped stop the attacker getting inside before he was shot dead by officers. Sir Keir said there was no doubt emergency services and the synagogue's security guards ""prevented an even greater tragedy"". PA Media A man drove a car into pedestrians and stabbed a security guard in the attack The attacker was wearing a suspected explosive device, which GMP have said was not viable, when he drove a car at crowds before stabbing a number of people. A witness at the scene said prayers had started when the attack happened but Rabbi Daniel Walker, who was leading the service, remained calm and he and others led the congregation to safety. He added: ""They are true heroes."" Sir Stephen said there were many worshippers inside the synagogue at the time of the incident. He praised security staff and worshippers who shut the attacker out, saying that thanks to the ""immediate bravery of security staff and the worshippers inside, as well as the fast response of the police, the attacker was prevented from gaining access"".

A major incident was declared at about 09.37 BST after police received a call from a man who said he had witnessed a car being driven towards members of the public and a male security guard had been stabbed. The attacker, Jihad Al-Shamie, a 35-year-old British man described as being of Syrian descent, was shot dead outside the Heaton Park Hebrew Congregation synagogue in Crumpsall, at about 09:40 BST. It is understood that he entered the UK as a very young child, and was granted British citizenship in 2006 as a minor. GMP said three people had been arrested - two men in their 30s and a woman in her 60s - as part of the investigation into what has been declared a ""terrorist incident"" by police. Rob Kanter, a university teacher who was inside the synagogue, said worshippers continued their service after being evacuated. He said the congregation were moved by police first into the rear hall of the building, then to a nearby centre, adding he did not fear for his safety. He said ""everyone was calm and dignified"" and people ""used an element of humour"" to keep going. Footage circulating online appeared to show the moment police opened fire The attacker was shot dead within seven minutes of the initial call to police.

The man then ""started getting back up and they [the police] shot him again"", Gareth said - describing it as ""nerve-racking"" to see. Another witness, Chava Lewin, who lives near the synagogue, said when the suspect got out of the car he ""started stabbing anyone near him"" after the vehicle crashed into the synagogue gates. After the attack, police said a loud explosion could be heard as ""specialist resources gained entry to the suspect's vehicle as a precaution"". PA Media Bomb disposal experts have been sent to the synagogue In his statement, Starmer said: ""Britain is also a country where Jewish buildings, synagogues, even schools require round the clock protection, where dedicated specialist security is necessary because of the daily threat of antisemitic hatred. ""Today's horrific incident shows why. And while this is not a new hate, this is something Jews have always lived with, we must be clear, it is a hatred that is rising once again, and Britain must defeat it once again. The prime minister said: ""To every Jewish person in this country, I also want to say this. I know how much fear you will be holding inside of you. I really do. ""And so on behalf of our country, I express my solidarity, but also my sadness that you still have to live with these fears. Nobody should have to do that. Nobody. ""And so I promise you that I will do everything in my power to guarantee you the security that you deserve, starting with a more visible police presence, protecting your community."" Counter-terrorism policing Assistant Commissioner Laurence Taylor said police forces across the UK were stepping up patrols at synagogues and Jewish sites to provide reassurance ""to all those communities that have been affected by this incident"". Forces were deploying ""all of our capabilities in response to what has happened"" and were working closely with security services to ensure we have a ""full intelligence picture"", he added. A major incident was declared at about 09:37 BST in the suburb in the north of Manchester The attack was carried out on Yom Kippur, the holiest day of the Jewish calendar, when work is forbidden and worshippers gather to pray. It is also a day when many who do not regularly attend synagogue services do so, and as a result security is often increased. Some Jewish people do not access social media or television during this holy day, meaning many may not yet have heard about the attack. Burnham confirmed that volunteers from the Community Security Trust, a charity that monitors antisemitism in the UK, were at the scene during the attack. The CST said it is working closely with police in Manchester to ensure security at synagogues is ""as strong as it can be"". The trust paid tribute to the security guards at the synagogue and the police officers who responded. CST urged everyone attending synagogues or any other Jewish premises to follow all instructions from security guards and police officers. ""In particular, we urge people not to congregate outside communal premises and synagogues to keep their doors closed at all times"", they said. ""This kind of attack is the reason why we have such extensive security in place across the Jewish community."" Reuters Jewish communities have been urged to be vigilant after the attack In response to the attack, the Manchester Council of Mosques said it was ""shocked and saddened"", adding ""our thoughts and prayers are with the victims, their families, and the Jewish community at this distressing time"". In a statement, it said: ""Manchester has always been a city where people of all faiths and backgrounds live side by side. ""Any attempt to divide us through violence or hatred will fail - we remain united in our commitment to peace and mutual respect."" The council has urged people to remain calm and called on the city to ""stand together as one Manchester, united against hatred"". Burnham has said he plans to reassure Jewish communities who have been living in a ""higher state of anxiety"" after rising incidents of antisemitism.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckg3499p18po,politics,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/66f2/live/69548920-a024-11f0-b741-177e3e2c2fc7.jpg,2025-10-03T00:14:58.346000+00:00,e2726f27093d18f8fc6404f47c54d9d46d09ce30
9668a88949ac,Refugees to face longer route to UK settlement rights,,"Refugees to face longer route to UK settlement rights Damian Grammaticas political correspondent and Kate Whannel political reporter Reuters Refugees will have to wait longer than the current five years before they can apply to settle permanently in the UK, under changes the government has said it is planning to the asylum system. It has also confirmed that the route enabling refugees to automatically bring close relatives to the UK - which was temporarily suspended in September - will be permanently scrapped. Sir Keir Starmer said the changes will mean ""there will be no golden ticket to settling in the UK, people will have to earn it."" It comes as the prime minister meets leaders at the European Political Community summit in Copenhagen, where he will be discussing ways to tackle illegal migration. Ahead of that meeting, the prime minister said ""fundamental changes"" were being made to the asylum system to show that ""settlement must be earned by contributing to the country"". The changes are similar to those already being planned for people arriving in the UK for other reasons, such as on a work visa, many of whom will have to wait 10 years to settle. Earlier this week, Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood set out her plans to make it similarly harder for other categories of migrant to qualify for indefinite leave to remain. Under the proposals, those wishing to apply will have to learn English to a high standard, have a clean criminal record, and volunteer in their community to be granted permanent settlement status. Details of the new conditions refugees will have to meet in order to settle in the UK and be accompanied by family members will be set out later in the autumn. A government source said the UK had been ""overly generous"" towards asylum seekers and wanted to show ""we get it, we will reduce the pull factors."" But shadow home secretary Chris Philp called the planned changes a ""Starmer gimmick"" that ""will make no difference whatsoever"". The Refugee Council, a charity, said the government's approach would not deter people trying to get to the UK but would instead push ""more desperate people into the arms of smugglers in an effort to reunite with loved ones"". The government has been trying to reduce the numbers of people arriving in the UK on small boats crossing the Channel. On coming to power in July 2024, Labour promised to ""stop the chaos"" of the ""small boat crisis"" but numbers remain at high levels. Currently refugees can apply to settle in the UK - also called indefinite leave to remain - after five years, giving them the right to live, work and study in the country for as long as they want provided they meet certain conditions . Under the forthcoming rules, the government says refugees will be offered a ""package of core protection"" but will face ""a new, longer route to settlement requiring them to contribute, replacing the current five years"". Reform UK has announced it would replace indefinite leave to remain with visas requiring migrants, excluding EU citizens whose rights are protected under Brexit treaties, to reapply every five years. The Migration Observatory estimates there are about 4.5 million people who hold indefinite leave to remain, including roughly 430,000 non-EU citizens. The expected changes to settlement rules for refugees will be accompanied by alterations to family reunion conditions. 'Fair but firm' Migration Minister Mike Tapp said the changes would stop migrants being able to ""shop around for asylum"". Tapp told BBC Breakfast that asylum seekers had been ""looking for the most generous, almost soft touch"" system. ""We're saying we're not a soft touch - we're fair but we're firm,"" he added. Asylum applications would still be decided on a ""case by case"" basis, but scrapping the automatic rights to family reunion and settlement would bring the UK ""into line"" with the rest of Europe, Tapp argued. Tapp also said the number of people returned to France under the ""one in, one out"" deal secured in July has risen to seven. A family of three were the first to arrive in the UK under the scheme last week. Under the treaty, France agreed to take back migrants who had travelled to the UK by small boat and had their asylum claim withdrawn or declared inadmissible. For each person returned to France, the UK will accept someone with a case for protection as a refugee who has not attempted to cross the Channel. Figures from the Home Office show 1,899 migrants crossed the Channel since Saturday, pushing the total number of recorded crossings since 2025 past 34,000. During Thursday's summit in Copenhagen, Sir Keir will meet Danish Prime Minister Mette Fredriksen. The two leaders are expected to announce £3m to encourage people from Western Balkan countries to stay in the region rather than migrate. The UK government is also contributing up to £5.75m - up from £4m this time last year - to Italy's Rome Process, a scheme aimed at reducing the number of migrants crossing from Africa to Europe. The government has said the prime minister will also discuss ""how to go further"" on changing the European Convention on Human Rights. On Wednesday, Sir Keir told the BBC he did not want to ""tear down"" human rights laws but was ready to look again at article three of the European Convention on Human Rights, which protects against torture and degrading treatment. Sir Keir's comments come after a Labour Party conference dominated by efforts to confront Reform UK, which has been leading opinion polls in recent months.

dc08030bb0ee,Starmer vows to protect Jewish communities after Manchester attack,,"Starmer vows to protect Jewish communities after Manchester attack Watch: Britain must defeat 'rising hatred' PM says Sir Keir Starmer has promised to do ""everything"" in his power to protect Jewish people as he said Britain must defeat antisemitic hate. The prime minister was speaking after two people were killed in a car and stabbing attack at the Heaton Park Synagogue in Crumpsall, north Manchester, on Thursday. Condemning the ""vile individual"" who carried out the ""horrific"" attack, on the holiest Jewish day of Yom Kippur, Sir Keir offered his condolences to the victims and their families and thanked the first responders. Greater Manchester Police said four other people remain in hospital. The attacker, who has been named as 35-year-old Jihad Al-Shamie, was shot dead by police at the scene. Police say three suspects are currently in custody and have been arrested on suspicion of commission, preparation and instigation of acts of terrorism. They are two men in their 30s and a woman in her 60s. In a recorded message to Jewish people, Sir Keir said: ""I know how much fear you will be holding inside of you. I really do... Nobody should have to do that. Nobody. ""And so I promise you that I will do everything in my power to guarantee you the security that you deserve, starting with a more visible police presence, protecting your community. ""I promise you that over the coming days, you will see the other Britain, the Britain of compassion, of decency, of love."" He added that hatred against Jews ""is rising once again, and Britain must defeat it once again"", as he reflected on the history of Jews seeking refuge in the UK. Getty Images Members of the public and congregants were solemn outside the Heaton Park Synagogue on Thursday afternoon The prime minister flew back to the UK early from the European Political Community summit in Denmark on Thursday to chair a meeting of the government's emergency Cobra committee and respond to the attack. Many national figures and community leaders have issued statements as the gravity of what happened becomes clear . King Charles III said in a statement that he and Queen Camilla were ""deeply shocked and saddened"" to hear about the attack, ""especially on such a significant day for the Jewish community"". ""Our thoughts and prayers are with all those affected by this appalling incident and we greatly appreciate the swift actions of the emergency services,"" the statement added. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu condemned the ""barbaric terror attack"". ""Our hearts are with the families of the murdered, and we pray for the swift recovery of the wounded. ""As I warned at the UN: weakness in the face of terrorism only brings more terrorism. Only strength and unity can defeat it."" Israel's foreign minister accused the UK government of failing to curb ""rampant antisemitic and anti-Israeli incitement in Britain"". Gideon Sa'ar said Israel expects ""more than words from the Starmer government"" and demanded a ""change of course"" on tackling anti-Jewish hatred. The Israeli embassy in the UK said it was ""in close contact"" with the Manchester Jewish community, the authorities and Jewish charity the Community Security Trust (CST) to ""ensure that the necessary support is provided"". Thanking the police and synagogue security for their response, the CST said it was an ""appalling attack on the holiest day of the Jewish year"" and it was working with the police and local Jewish community. President of the Conference of European Rabbis, Pinchas Goldschmidt, called for more to be done to ""stamp out murderous ideologies"" following the attack. ""Jews in Manchester, England, woke up this morning to pray, and were murdered in their own synagogue,"" he said in a statement to PA. Yom Kippur is a day of fasting and atonement and is believed to be the day God seals the fate of each person for the coming years. It is a day set aside for prayer and reflection, when work is forbidden and many attend synagogue services even if they do not do so regularly. The Chief Rabbi Sir Ephraim Mirvis said the incident was ""the day we hoped we would never see, but which deep down, we knew would come"". He said the attack was the ""tragic result"" of an ""unrelenting wave of Jew hatred on our streets, campuses, on social media and elsewhere"". ""Our hearts are shattered,"" he said in a statement shared with the BBC. The Board of Deputies of British Jews and the Jewish Leadership Council said: ""We are devastated at the loss of two members of our Jewish community, and our thoughts are with their families, those who are injured and receiving treatment, and all those who have been affected by this act of antisemitic terror."" It was a sentiment echoed by Imam Qari Asim, co-chairman of the British Muslim Network, who said the scenes in Manchester had ""no place in our society"" and ""antisemitism in all its forms is totally unacceptable"". ""The bloodshed and violence in the Middle East - which is excruciatingly painful to witness for all of us - must not be allowed to poison our streets in Britain,"" he said. And Allama Qamaruzzaman AzmI, chief imam of Anwaar ul Haramain Jamé Masjid in north Manchester, said ""we stand in solidarity with our Jewish neighbours and community"" and he was ""committed"" to strengthening the bond between them. Reuters People had gathered at the scene Meanwhile, the Church of England's leader, Archbishop of York Stephen Cottrell, said he was praying that ""all may live alongside each other in harmony and respect"". The Bishop of Manchester, the Rt Rev Dr David Walker, said he feared an increase in divisive rhetoric recently in the UK and elsewhere in the world which should not be allowed ""to get ahead of our humanity"". He said ""short-term political gain is no excuse for long-term damage to the fabric of our communities"". 'It was a matter of when, not if' Figures from across the political spectrum have condemned the attack. Mayor of Greater Manchester Andy Burnham said on X: ""We condemn whoever is responsible and will do everything within our power to keep people safe. We stand with GM's Jewish community at this time and will work through the day to support them."" Alex Hearn, co-director of Labour Against Antisemitism, told BBC News: ""Many Jews understood it was never 'if' an attack like this was going to happen, it was 'when', because attacks against Jews have spiralled out of control and some mass attacks have already been foiled by the security services."" But he said there was ""a lot of anger"" about what he said was ""very little action"" over anti-Jewish hate being allowed to ""flourish"" and ""take root in institutions"". He said synagogues and Jewish schools, including primary schools, have needed security ""for a long time"". Asked about the synagogue attack in Manchester, Tory leader Kemi Badenoch told the BBC it looks like ""an outrageous attack on the Jewish community on their holiest day"" - calling it ""vile and disgusting"". Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey said he was ""horrified and appalled"" and that his ""thoughts are with the victims"". Reform UK leader Nigel Farage said he was ""horrified"" and thinking of the Jewish community ""who will be suffering at this time"".

Serving Met Officers called for immigrants to be shot, revelled in the use of force and were dismissive of rape claims in footage captured by a Panorama undercover reporter. Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood described the footage, which also shows officers making sexualised comments to colleagues and sharing racist views about immigrants and Muslims, as ""disturbing"" and ""sickening"". Sir Mark Rowley, head of the Met Police, has apologised for the ""reprehensible and completely unacceptable"" behaviour. In a letter addressed to the mayor and home secretary after the documentary aired, he listed a series of ""immediate actions"" the force had taken, including having dismantled the custody team at the Charing Cross police station, and senior leadership changes that cover west London. Sir Mark added that all those involved will be ""put on a fast-track hearing within weeks and [are] on a path to likely dismissal"". After the BBC sent a detailed list of allegations to the Met, it suspended eight officers and one staff member, and took two more officers off front-line duties. Mina Smallman, the mother of two murdered sisters, told the BBC's Newsnight she was not shocked by the allegations. Two Met Police officers were jailed this year after they shared photos of her daughters' bodies on WhatsApp. ""When people are comfortable and their guard is down, we get to see what they're really like,"" she said. Ms Smallman added that the Met was ""not going to change overnight"". She said ""this behaviour has been there for so long, it's going to take ages to root out"". Watch: 'When their guard is down we get to see what they're really like' - Mina Smallman Sir Sadiq said ""sexism, racism, misogyny and the excessive use of force"" had ""no place in the police"". ""I have met with the commissioner to discuss directly the issues exposed by the BBC - and its impact on public confidence and trust in the police,"" he said, before the BBC programme was broadcast. ""A series of urgent changes have been put in place at Charing Cross police station and across the Met, with more to follow."" The mayor backed Sir Mark, saying he had confidence in the commissioner's efforts to kick wrongdoers out of the Met. The home secretary welcomed the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) ""fully and urgently investigating all the issues raised in this report"". ""It is right that the Metropolitan Police have condemned this, and we fully support their pledge to root out those unfit to serve the public,"" Mahmood added. ""We have given police chiefs the powers to automatically sack officers who fail background checks and dismiss those guilty of gross misconduct, and we expect them to be used."" Sir Mark, speaking before he had seen the film's Wednesday evening broadcast, said that ""where there is incontrovertible evidence"" of wrongdoing it is likely that accused serving officers would be dismissed within weeks. ""Officers behaving in such appalling, criminal ways, let down our communities and will cause some to question if their sons and daughters are safe in our cells, and whether they would be believed and respected as victims of crime,"" he said. ""For that, I am truly sorry."" Footage shows police disbelieving alleged rape and domestic violence victim The Liberal Democrats called the findings ""beyond appalling"". ""The public is being failed, as are the majority of police officers who are doing their best for the people of London,"" said the party's London spokesman, Luke Taylor MP. ""The Home Secretary now has a responsibility to intervene and work with the Met to tackle this behaviour once and for all."" Paula Dodds, chairwoman of the Metropolitan Police Federation, said it ""deplores any discriminatory behaviour in the strongest possible terms - such behaviour has no place in policing or society. ""If officers are proven to be guilty of criminal offences or serious gross misconduct, then we do not want these individuals in the job."" However, she said ""all police officers - like all people - have the right to representation and due process, and not trial by media or documentary"". Rachel Watson, who leads the IOPC, said she was ""appalled by what Panorama has exposed - these behaviours are completely unacceptable and have no place in policing"". She said an investigation was already under way and hoped the BBC would now share its evidence ""to allow our work to progress at pace"". Zoe Billingham, who served as Her Majesty's Inspector of Constabulary from 2009 to 2021, told The World Tonight on BBC Radio 4 that Sir Mark was a ""reforming"" figure, but that the revelations were ""tricky"" for him. ""I do think the pace of change really now needs to be demonstrated to Londoners if that precious bond of trust is to be restored,"" she said. A former detective superintendent at the Met, Shabnam Chaudhri, said she was ""shocked to the core"". ""Policing is in my blood,"" she told Newsnight.

It is a civilian role which involves working closely with sergeants and constables, but not taking part in arrests. The station had been the focus of an investigation by the IOPC police watchdog into bullying and discrimination nearly four years ago. It found that some officers had discussed hitting their girlfriends, shared offensive and discriminatory comments and joked about rape in private group chats.

d728f1a9bdb9,Two-child benefit cap has been devastating - Phillipson,,"Two-child benefit cap has been devastating - Phillipson Becky Morton Political reporter Bridget Phillipson: Why should children be punished for events out of their control? Bridget Phillipson has said the two-child benefit cap has had a ""devastating impact"", as she signalled the government could soon lift it. Asked whether this needed to happen now, the education secretary and deputy leadership candidate, told the BBC there was ""a real urgency"". The policy, introduced by the Conservatives, prevents households on universal or child tax credit from receiving payments for a third or subsequent child born after April 2017. The government is widely expected to change the two-child limit in November's Budget, with reports suggesting the Treasury is looking at different options to replace it, including a tapered system. Asked if the chancellor was about to the lift the cap, Phillipson told the BBC's Political Thinking with Nick Robinson podcast: ""I'm leading the child poverty task force and I've been doing that work from government. ""But I'm clear about what needs to happen. I'm clear about what the evidence tells us. And I'm clear about what we need to do."" She added: ""There's a real urgency about this because every year that passes, as children are born, as they move into that system, the numbers go up, child poverty rates increase. So we have to tackle it."" The education secretary argued that children should not be ""punished"" for events beyond their control, for example if a parent loses their job and has to rely on benefits. ""This was a Tory policy that's had a devastating impact on children and we'll sort it,"" she said. Sir Keir Starmer has previously spoken of his desire to ditch the two-child cap when economic conditions allow, without specifying exact circumstances. According to the Guardian newspaper , officials are considering whether there could be a tapered rate, so parents receive the most benefits for their first child and less for subsequent children. Other options under consideration include limiting additional benefits to three or four children, the newspaper reported. Asked whether the cap needed to be scrapped completely or if it could instead be amended, Phillipson told the BBC: ""Through the work of the taskforce I see all the evidence, I look at the numbers, I look at the impact of different policies. ""This isn't the only way we'll take action, to be clear, because there are other steps we need to take, whether on skills, rights at work, much more besides, childcare. But I know what the evidence tells me."" The Resolution Foundation think tank says axing the cap would cost an estimated £3.5bn and would lift 470,000 children out of poverty. Campaigners have called for it to be abolished in full, arguing this would be the most cost-effective way to reduce child poverty. 'In the room' Phillipson said tackling child poverty would be her ""number one priority"" if she was elected Labour's next deputy leader, to replace Angela Rayner after her resignation last month. ""It really is personal to me. I know what it's like to not grow up with very much,"" she said. Phillipson's rival in the contest, her former cabinet colleague Lucy Powell, has also criticised the cap and said scrapping it would be the ""single biggest policy we could do to address child poverty"". Powell was sacked from her role as Commons leader in a reshuffle last month. Phillipson rejected the idea that as a cabinet minister she would have less freedom to challenge the prime minister over government policy. ""What I'll bring as deputy leader is the ability to unite our party and our movement,"" she told the BBC. ""But alongside that I'll be a strong voice at the cabinet table for members. So I'll be in the room when those decisions are being made, able to push for the things that members want to see."" Highlighting her record as education secretary, Phillipson said she had fought ""tooth and nail"" for policies like the expansion of free school meals . She added that ""there's a limit to what you can do"" from outside cabinet and ""what I don't think members want is for us to be airing our dirty linen in public"". In her pitch to Labour members at a hustings on Wednesday, Powell said she would be a ""full-time deputy"" and ""a strong independent voice"". If elected, she pledged to have ""difficult conversations"" with the leadership, while refusing to ""snipe from the sidelines"". Although Phillipson gained more nominations to be deputy leader from her fellow MPs, published polling of party members has suggested Powell is the frontrunner in the contest. However, Phillipson's campaign have pointed to her greater number of nominations from the trade union movement. Voting in a ballot of Labour members and affiliated supporters is open from 8 October to 23 October, with the result of the contest announced on 25 October.

16761a2b2701,PM tells BBC he wants to change how international law used in asylum cases,,"PM tells BBC he wants to change how international law used in asylum cases Sam Francis Political reporter Watch: Starmer says he will ""look again"" at human rights laws Sir Keir Starmer wants to change how international law is interpreted, to stop unsuccessful asylum seekers blocking their deportation on the grounds they could be sent to worse prisons or healthcare systems. The prime minister told the BBC he did not want to ""tear down"" human rights laws, but is ready to look again at article three of the European Convention on Human Rights, which protects against torture and degrading treatment. The prime minister said mass migration in recent years meant there needed to be a change, but those genuinely fleeing persecution should still be given asylum. His comments came after his home secretary set out plans to tighten rules for migrants seeking indefinite leave to remain . On the issue of deportation, he was asked by Radio 4's Today programme about the example of a Brazilian paedophile who successfully claimed he would be treated worse in a Brazilian prison than he would in a British prison. Sir Keir said there was a difference between deporting someone to ""summary execution"" and sending them to somewhere with a different level of healthcare or prison conditions. He added ""we need to look again at the interpretation"" of a wide range of international laws by UK courts. He warned that laws must be ""applied in the circumstances as they are now"" before adding that countries were experiencing ""mass migration in a way that we have not seen in previous years"". To meet this new challenge ""we need to look at again at the interpretation of some of these provisions, not tear them down"", he said. He added: ""I believe that those genuinely fleeing persecution should be afforded asylum and that is a compassionate act."" Pressed for details about what was blocking deportations of foreign criminals, Sir Keir cited Articles 3 and 8 of the ECHR - which ban torture and protect the right to private and family life respectively. ""But it's more than that,"" he said, pointing to the UN's Refugee Convention, Torture Convention and Convention on the Rights of the Child as potential barriers. Leading human rights lawyer Shami Chakrabarti said the number of cases where the courts have ruled someone cannot be removed because of inhuman and degrading treatment, were ""very very rare"". ""To say that it's inhuman and degrading because the situation is worse back home than it is in the UK has never been the test that has been employed by the UK courts,"" she said. Ministers were already exploring ways to tighten the interpretation of some aspects of the ECHR to crack down on immigration. In May, the government's immigration white paper promised legislation to ""clarify"" how the right to a family life in European human rights law should apply to immigration cases. Before being made foreign secretary, Yvette Cooper ordered home officials to look into how courts used laws that halted deportations on torture grounds. Sir Keir's comments come after a Labour conference dominated by efforts to confront Reform UK . The prime minister used his keynote speech to cast Nigel Farage's movement as practising the ""politics of grievance"" and to position Labour as the party of ""tolerant, decent"" patriotism. He stopped short in the speech of repeating his attack on Reform's deportation proposals as ""racist"" but vowed to fight racist rhetoric ""with everything we have"". In an interview with GB News on Wednesday, Sir Keir said the small boats were ""Farage boats,"" because he advocated Brexit, which made the Dublin Regulation - an agreement allowing the repatriation of asylum seekers to their EU country -  invalid. Prior to Brexit, the UK was allowed to return people who had tried unsuccessfully to claim asylum to other EU member states, taking into consideration factors such as family reunion and irregular entry. The scheme ended in the UK after Brexit, in January 2021. Sir Keir has also spent the conference contending with a provocative challenge to his leadership by Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham who said Labour MPs had asked him all summer to return to Westminster and take over as prime minister. Asked about internal challenges to his leadership, Sir Keir said he had ""been underestimated every time"" he had taken on a senior role. Despite this, ""I pushed through the barriers,"" he said. Sir Keir told the BBC: ""I didn't come into politics as some sort of popularity contest. ""I came in with one focus, which is changing my country for the better. ""I'm proud to be prime minister, getting on with that work."" During a wide-ranging interview, Sir Keir also said it was ""wrong"" that thousands of young people remained out of work because of mental problems. ""I'm not saying you don't and shouldn't have benefits for mental health issues but I do think we need to examine this quite carefully,"" he added. ""I say it because if you are on benefits, in your 20s, it is going to be extremely difficult to get off benefits for the rest of your life."" Speaking to BBC Breakfast, he added he was committed getting ""bills down for those at home and for businesses,"" as energy costs increase by 2% from Wednesday for millions of people in England, Wales and Scotland, as regulator Ofgem's latest price cap come into effect. Asked about the soaring price of food , Sir Keir said the recently published UK-EU SPS Agreement - which stands for sanitary and phytosanitary and refers to rules about animals and food - would mean food prices would soon drop. Separately, in an interview with the BBC's political editor Chris Mason, Sir Keir said he thought some people who had gone to university ""might have been better off"" completing an apprenticeship. He said he wanted ""gold standard"" apprenticeships,  to be as ""equally regarded, equally respected"" , as a university degree. In his speech to the Labour Party Conference, he said he wanted to see two-thirds of young people in the UK go to university or study a technical qualification after leaving school. The new ambition will include both degree-level apprenticeships, which are partly funded by the employer through a levy, and qualifications which sit just below the level equivalent to a university degree. He said the party's old ambition to ""get 50% of kids to uni"" - a target set by Tony Blair in 1999 - was no longer ""right for our times"".",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cd72p30v574o,politics,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/b941/live/be603cf0-9e91-11f0-928c-71dbb8619e94.jpg,2025-10-01T10:05:47.580000+00:00,761aa1970bbbde70fefe594e6c8b4c4efc86ffe1
ba52a320b6df,"Michelle Mone should be stripped of peerage, says Badenoch",,"Michelle Mone should be stripped of peerage, says Badenoch Getty Images Mone dismissed the court ruling as ""an establishment win"" for the government Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch has said Baroness Michelle Mone should be stripped of her peerage. A company linked to the Glaswegian entrepreneur, PPE Medpro, has been ordered by the High Court to repay £122m to the UK government for breaching a Covid contract. Badenoch told BBC News that what she had heard from the case against PPE Medpro was ""enough"" for her to be stripped of her title. Mone was made a Tory peer by David Cameron in 2015, but lost the whip following the revelations about the contract to supply medical gowns. The Conservatives said in December 2023 that she was no longer a member of the party. This was later disputed by Mone. The baroness described the court ruling as ""nothing less than an establishment win for the government in a case that was too big to lose"". Getty Images Kemi Badenoch spoke to the BBC ahead of the Conservative conference in Manchester Speaking to BBC Scotland News ahead of her party's annual conference in Manchester, Badenoch said: ""I want to make sure is that people can see that the Conservative Party is a party of integrity. ""That's why we removed Michelle Mone from our party. ""And it's very, very important that people see that politicians, whether they're in the Commons or in the Lords, are acting above board."" Peerages can only be removed by an act of Parliament. The SNP have called for the UK government to take that step . Mone is on a leave of absence from the House of Lords and Chancellor Rachel Reeves said she did not want the entrepreneur to return. However, she said it was beyond her power to strip Mone of her peerage. During a fringe event at Labour's party conference this week, Reeves reportedly joked that the government had a vendetta against the peer. Mone has accused the chancellor of using ""dangerous and inflammatory"" language . PPE Medpro, which was set up by a consortium led by Mone's husband, Doug Barrowman, was awarded lucrative contracts to supply 25 million medical gowns to the NHS during the pandemic. However, the equipment has been in storage since 2020 after the company failed to prove it was correctly sterilised. A spokesman for Mr Barrowman described the High Court judgement as ""a travesty of justice"". Getty Images Doug Barrowman and Michelle Mone have been married since 2020 Meanwhile, looking ahead to the Scottish Parliament election in May, Badenoch insisted it was ""all to play for"". She said that while the SNP was ahead in the polls, Scots were ""fed up"" with the party, criticising its record on education and the economy. The Tory leader also dismissed calls for a second independence referendum as a ""distraction"". The Scottish Conservatives have been the largest opposition party at Holyrood since 2016. However, recent polls suggest the party is now in a battle to finish as the country's fourth largest party. Badenoch said voters were ""going to protest parties"" due to the Conservative's historic defeat at last year's general election and the unpopularity of Sir Keir Starmer's government. North Sea fears ""What I'm doing is making sure the Scottish people know that the Conservative and Unionist Party is fighting for them, especially in the one area where Scotland leads, and that is on our North Sea oil industry,"" she said. The Tory leader warned that the economy was underperforming and that people getting poorer could lead to ""civil unrest"". She said that Aberdeen was ""dying"", with the oil and gas industry, local supply chain and high street all in need of support. ""We cannot kill industry in Scotland,"" she said. ""We are backing it fully."" The UK Labour government has committed to banning new exploration licences, warning that exploring new fields would reduce household bills or improve energy security.

720cbfeeaa81,"Donors covering Farage security after cuts, Reform claims",,"Donors covering Farage security after cuts, Reform claims PA Media Reform UK leader Nigel Farage's publicly-funded security detail has been cut by 75%, the party's head of policy has claimed. Zia Yusuf said the decision had been taken two weeks ago by parliamentary officials for ""inexplicable reasons"", with party donors stepping in to ""ensure that his security is shored up"". The Commons authorities said they do not comment on individual cases, but a ""rigorous"" process was in place to assess arrangements for MPs. It comes amid an escalating war of words between Reform and Sir Keir Starmer over Labour attacks on Farage during its party conference in Liverpool. Speaking to the BBC, Yusuf accused the prime minister of co-ordinating a ""campaign of incitement to violence"" against Farage, adding that the Reform UK leader had been subjected to ""unprecedented vilification"" by ministers. It comes after Sir Keir described Reform UK's policy of scrapping indefinite leave to remain as ""racist"" and accused Farage of not liking Britain. Reform has accused the prime minister of describing Farage and the party's supporters as racists, something Sir Keir has denied. Yusuf accused Sir Keir of ""circling the drain"", claiming polling showed Labour members want Sir Keir to stand down as the party's leader. ""So how's he responded? He's responded by co-ordinating the most unprecedented vilification and campaign of incitement to violence against the man who, frankly, he knows he cannot beat at the ballot box,"" he said. 'For the police' He added that the attacks on Farage this week had come ""in the context"" of the decision to downgrade the Reform UK leader's security by Parliament's security team, which manages security for both MPs and members of the House of Lords. Speaking earlier to Times Radio, he added that the decision was made ""from what I can tell, for inexplicable reasons"", without elaborating further. In his BBC interview, Yusuf said that ""reasonable people"" would be able to question whether the decision was appropriate, given Reform UK's rise in national opinion polls since last year's general election. Speaking to Radio 5 Live at Labour conference, Cabinet Office Minister Pat McFadden dismissed the idea that security decisions were political, adding it was an operational matter ""for the police and the security authorities"". The Parliamentary Security Department is responsible for security within Parliament, and works with police forces, who are responsible for security outside of the parliamentary estate. MPs are provided with security based on their risk. In May last year the previous government announced a £31m package to increase security provision for MPs. It said the money would also ensure elected politicians, as well as election candidates, had a dedicated named police contact to liaise with on security matters. A spokesperson for the House of Commons said assessments of individual MPs' security arrangements was ""subject to a rigorous risk-based assessment, conducted by security professionals and with input from a range of professional authorities."" ""Whilst these are naturally kept under continuous review, we do not comment on specific details so as not to compromise the safety of MPs, parliamentary staff or members of the public,"" they added. Health Minister Stephen Kinnock rejected Yusuf's claims about incitement, adding he was ""lecturing us on something where they are just not qualified to lecture anybody"". ""We live in a world where there is very robust political debate, that has been going on for a long time,"" he added.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cj4ypey88kdo,politics,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/1944/live/6602d520-9ebb-11f0-85b6-27ff7e482819.jpg,2025-10-01T16:14:50.716000+00:00,0a18f0dd414ca1621513b67eff62d255540c5328
3587de766caa,Ex-Tory defence minister joins Reform UK,,"A former Welsh Conservative MP says she has joined Reform UK and wants to stand for the party in next May's Senedd election. Ex-Wrexham MP and former junior defence minister Sarah Atherton left the Tories earlier this year. She now wants to be a Reform candidate in the new Fflint Wrecsam constituency having ""put her hat in the ring"". Atherton told the BBC she had joined Reform because of her concerns over a ""loss of national identity and pressure on public services"". She added that she had ""had enough of 26 years of decline in Wales under a Labour and Plaid Cymru pact"". Atherton added that she worried ""like millions of others"" about the direction the UK was heading. It comes as Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch told BBC Wales that turning around the fortunes of her party cannot happen ""overnight"" , with bumps in the road along the way. Atherton is the third high-profile former Conservative to join the part in Wales, after former Brexit minister David Jones and Conservative Member of the Senedd Laura Anne Jones. Reform is currently deciding who will be its candidates next May. Under Wales' new election map, 16 seats will each elect six members, chosen from party lists. Atherton left the Conservative Party in August having said the previous year that the Conservatives should ""embrace"" Nigel Farage and Reform. At the time she said the Conservatives were ""impotent"" and ""no longer align with her values or ideology"". Having served as Wrexham MP from 2019 until she lost her seat in 2024, Atherton was parliamentary under-secretary of state for defence people, veterans and service families for a brief period in 2022. She was the first Conservative politician to represent the Wrexham constituency since its creation in 1918. Ms Badenoch later told PA News: ""Former MPs have been defecting. Many of them are going where they think the wind is blowing."" But she conceded that leaders are ""always sad to lose party members"".

c4382e9aaae0,Labour deputy debate exposes differences in approach,,"Rival deputy leadership candidates Bridget Phillipson and Lucy Powell went head-to-head in a hustings at the very end of the Labour Party conference in Liverpool. Education Secretary Phillipson and former Commons Leader Powell both wore dark blue dresses as they sat to one side of the giant stage, with a large podium standing empty in the middle. This is a contest the Labour leadership did not want to have, in case it highlighted internal divisions when the party is behind in the polls. So the hustings - where the two candidates set out their stalls and answered members' questions - was shunted beyond the official end of the annual conference, with no TV camera access, although it was streamed on Labour's YouTube channel. As the session began the audience were asked not to applaud because ""cumulatively applause could knock out a whole question,"" in a hall that was far from full. Phillipson and Powell are vying to replace Angela Rayner as the deputy leader of the party, after she resigned over what she insisted were mistakes in paying her stamp duty. The pair were each given two minutes to make their cased to the membership, with Phillipson stressing how, as education secretary, she would be a voice ""at the heart of government"" and would deliver the Employment Rights Bill in full. She spoke of the need for unity but how she was a candidate who would push the government to be bold and took a swipe at her competitor, suggesting she was the candidate of ""division and disunity"" and that Labour could not afford to look inwards. By contrast, Powell said she would be a ""full time deputy"" who would be able to ""wrestle back the megaphone"" and set the terms of the debate as the party's ""campaigner in chief"". She highlighted how the deputyship ""is a party role, not a government one"" and said her focus would be bringing the voices of councillors, members and communities to the attention of government. However, she said she would not ""shy away"" from difficult conversations because the government would make better decisions ""when we reflect the views of our broad movement and when our values shine through"". She added: ""Having this debate is not dissent but an important conversation about how we can be better - because we need to be."" There was consensus on some issues - that in taking on Nigel Farage, Labour should  not ""ape"" Reform but there was a different emphasis from each candidate on what the Labour government had got wrong. Both said winter fuel cuts had been a mistake but Phillipson said the party should focus on ""the 90% of things it got right"" - including family hubs and workers' rights -while Powell said that it wasn't possible to ""sugar-coat"" big errors, adding that voter disillusionment needed to be addressed. Team Powell seem confident of their prospects with the membership, but the Phillipson campaign point to her greater number of nominations from the trade union movement. Labour members have until 23 October to vote for their preferred candidate and the result will be announced on 25 October.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cqxzpgjqd82o,politics,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/c482/live/4d47d220-9ebf-11f0-9ab9-d38bf221fde2.png,2025-10-01T13:05:01.187000+00:00,6a56ddefc6eb834af55b5963fbb5b2382a1fe3ed
807da3f83736,Labour plans new law to ban fracking permanently,,"The Labour government is planning to pass a new law that would ban fracking for shale gas permanently in England, Energy Secretary Ed Miliband has announced. At Labour's conference, Miliband said he wanted to legislate at the earliest opportunity and launch a national campaign against fracking in the meantime. Fracking is currently only limited by a suspension on ministerial decisions to grant licences. The practice has been suspended numerous times over the last few decades, most recently in 2022, over concerns about earthquakes and environmental impacts. But Reform UK has said it would bring back fracking and has threatened to ""wage war"" on renewables developers if it wins power. In speech at Labour's conference, Miliband said fracking would ""not take a penny off bills"" and ""trash our climate commitments"". ""The good news is that communities have fought back and won this fight before and will do so again,"" Miliband said. Labour said Miliband would launch a campaign to take on Reform UK over shale gas exploration. The energy secretary told Labour's conference: ""Let's ban fracking and send the frackers packing."" The government will announce in the outcome of the North Sea Energy Future consultation that it will legislate to permanently ban new onshore oil and gas licences, ensuring that no future fracking can take place in England. Labour sources say a timeline for the legislation will be set out in due course. Fracking projects under previous governments were hampered by planning delays, minor earthquakes, legal challenges and persistent protests. Rishi Sunak reinstated the moratorium on fracking when he was prime minister in 2022 and Labour said it would ban the practice permanently in its general election manifesto. The party says Miliband's campaign will rally activists and local communities across the country against fracking, and promote investment in clean, homegrown power. Labour is focusing on building out the UK's renewable energy and is aiming for clean power to meet 95% of electricity demand by 2030. It is part of the government plan to achieve the target of reducing carbon emissions to net zero by 2050. In his speech, Miliband also announced an expansion of Great British Energy's scheme to install solar panels on the roofs of schools and hospitals. He also outlined plans to boost the number of jobs in the clean energy sector and improve workers' rights in those industries. Throughout the conference, Labour ministers have said they're in a fight over climate action with Reform UK, which has pledged to scrap net zero if the party wins power. In his speech, Miliband said Labour had to take the fight to Reform, which ""would wreck everything we are doing"". ""And let's call it out: theirs is an all-out war on future generations too,"" Miliband said. ""I'm proud of British climate leadership. I'm proud of Labour climate leadership."" Polling consistently shows a majority of the public supporting the UK's net zero target but also indicates public concern over the costs. Labour has spent its week in Liverpool targeting Nigel Farage, with Sir Keir Starmer using his speech on Tuesday to accuse the Reform UK's leader of not believing in Britain and sowing division. Miliband said the threat from Reform ""goes beyond their climate denying agenda"". He said Farage was ""a key part of a global network who together want to destroy the ties that bind our communities and our way of life"". The energy secretary lashed out at the billionaire Elon Musk, accusing him of inciting ""violence on our streets"" and enabling ""disinformation through X"". Miliband said: ""Conference, we have a message for Elon Musk: Get the hell out of our politics."" At the conference, ministers have also said they are considering removing policy costs from energy bills to make electricity cheaper. Speaking at a fringe event, Energy Minister Michael Shanks said the government was ""looking at everything"" to reduce energy bills and understood ""the strong argument for moving policy costs on to gas rather than electricity"". ""I think it's really important to squeeze as much money out of bills as we can,"" Shanks said. ""We've not ruled out options but there are no quick answers that don't have trade-offs somewhere else."" Policy costs are effectively government taxes used to fund environmental and social schemes, such as subsidies for renewables. These costs made up about 16% of an electricity bill and 6% of a gas bill last year, according to research by the charity Nesta. The Climate Change Committee has long recommended removing policy costs from electricity bills to help people feel the benefits of net-zero transition. The government's climate adviser said the move would make switching to electric technologies, such as heat pumps, cheaper and encourage take-up.

954b1fb8f3c5,Five takeaways from Starmer's conference speech,,"Five takeaways from Starmer's conference speech Watch: Key moments from Starmer's Labour conference speech Sir Keir Starmer sought to rally his party and set out his vision for the country in his keynote speech at Labour's conference in Liverpool. So, what were the standout moments? Let's look at five of them. Taking aim at Reform UK The central theme of the Labour conference is taking the fight to Reform UK, which is leading in UK-wide opinion polls. Throughout the conference, Labour ministers and MPs have attacked Reform and framed its fight with the party in existential terms. In his speech, the prime minister reinforced that message, telling the party faithful the country faced a stark choice between ""renewal or decline"". ""It is a test,"" Sir Keir said. ""A fight for the soul of our country, every bit as big as rebuilding Britain after the war, and we must all rise to this challenge."" Calling out the Reform UK leader by name, Sir Keir asked: ""When was the last time you heard Nigel Farage say anything positive about Britain's future? ""He can't. He doesn't like Britain. Doesn't believe in Britain."" In these spiky comments, Sir Keir was pointedly naming Farage as the principal opponent in the ""fight"", rather than Labour's traditional competitor for power, the Conservatives. The Tories were barely mentioned, and there was a chorus of laughter when Sir Keir quipped: ""The Tories - remember them?"" Hard truths on migration PA Media There has been some discomfort among Labour MPs over the home secretary's plans to make it harder for migrants to gain permanent settlement status in the UK . Sir Keir acknowledged this in his speech, but argued the government would have to take ""decisions that will not always be comfortable for our party"". In a departure from the New Labour years, he said the party had placed too much faith in globalisation and the idea that ""immigration is all we need to give us the workers"". He talked about meeting a woman in Oldham, shortly after becoming an MP in 2015. Sir Keir said the woman complained about ""a group of men from Eastern Europe"" who had recently moved into her street, ""didn't put the rubbish out at the right time and spat on the ground"". The prime minister said the woman ""felt she had to prove to a Labour politician that she wasn't racist"". Sir Keir said at that time, Labour ""had become a party that patronised working people"" and ""that's why we changed the party"". A focus on apprenticeships The speech blended the personal and the political. But the prime minister did announce one new policy. Sir Keir said the UK government would scrap a commitment to get 50% of England's young people into university. Tony Blair set the target over 20 years ago to boost social mobility when he was prime minister, and the symbolic 50% mark was passed for the first time in 2019. Sir Keir said the target would be changed to two-thirds of young people going to university or ""gold standard apprenticeships"". He said the government would invest in new technical excellence colleges and skills training. Personal and political were entwined here: he reminded the conference about his father's job as a toolmaker who worked with his hands - and said that further education colleges had been ""ignored - because politicians' kids don't go there"". Starmer's version of patriotism PA Media There's been a lot of debate about patriotism and national flags - and what they represent - ahead of and during the conference. A few weeks ago, following a march organised by far-right activist Tommy Robinson in London, the prime minister said the UK would never ""surrender"" its flag to those who wish to use it as ""a symbol of violence, fear and division."" To a waving sea of flags in the conference hall, Sir Keir elaborated on that argument. ""Labour is the party of national renewal. Labour is the patriotic party."" He said the flags of the UK ""belong to all of us and we will never surrender them"". Patriotism, the prime minister said, was about serving the ""common good"" - and disputing the idea that Britain was ""broken"", Sir Keir praised the work of ordinary people, including a woman named Melanie who organises meet-ups for people in care in Yorkshire. He also mentioned Kaitlyn, a 15-year-old sitting in the audience, who set up her own girls football team at school in Barnet, and George, who delivers food parcels in Telford. ""Mere politics cannot break Britain, conference,"" Sir Keir said. Looking back - and ahead - to tough Budget decisions The upcoming Budget has loomed over the conference, fuelling speculation of tax rises, which most economists think are likely. In his speech, the prime minister reflected on the last Budget, which saw the chancellor unveil £40bn in tax rises - the biggest increase in a generation - to raise money to pay for the NHS and other public services. ""We asked a lot at the last Budget - I know that,"" Sir Keir said. ""And the tough decisions they will keep on coming."" Rejecting calls for a wealth tax and increases in borrowing to fund government spending, Sir Keir said he would not ""cast off the constraints and indulge in ideological fantasy"". Sir Keir said losing control of the economy means ""working people pay the price"" and promised ""I will never let that happen again"".",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c36krle3894o,politics,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/13ff/live/47e2f580-9e1a-11f0-928c-71dbb8619e94.jpg,2025-09-30T15:20:10.373000+00:00,4fa6a9d69e8ddae68326910c6e7d4e84f549bf36
78fef204f1af,Lammy backtracks on Farage Hitler Youth claim,,"Deputy Prime Minister David Lammy rowed back on claims Nigel Farage ""flirted with Hitler Youth"". Lammy's comments were an apparent reference to allegations that emerged in 2013 that Farage sang Nazi songs as a teenager. The Reform UK leader denied the allegations at the time, which centred on a claim that as a schoolboy in the late 1970s and early 1980s he and others marched through a village ""shouting Hitler Youth songs"". A Reform source told BBC News: ""It's disgusting and libellous. Beneath contempt."" On Sunday, Sir Keir Starmer described Reform UK's policy of scrapping indefinite leave to remain as ""racist"" and ""immoral"". Since then senior Labour figures have been careful to try to draw a distinction between calling a policy of Reform UK ""racist"" but insisting they're not using the same label about the party's supporters. In his conference speech, the prime minister stepped up his attacks on Farage and Reform, claiming they did not love their country and were only interested in stirring division. He also vowed to fight racist rhetoric ""with everything we have"". Speaking after the speech on the BBC's Politics Live, Lammy was asked whether he thought Farage was a racist. He said the PM had been calling out policies ""that would line people up who have a right to be in this country, who might be Indian, who might be Nigerian, and send them home"". He added: ""It's not British. It doesn't respect our values. ""I'm not going to play the man. I'm playing the ball, as our leader did. ""I will leave it for the public to come to their own judgements about someone who once flirted with Hitler Youth when he was younger."" Shortly after making the comments, Lammy said he was ""happy to clarify"" them, in an interview with the BBC News Channel. ""He [Farage] has denied it and so I accept that he has denied it and I would like to clarify that position because in the end the prime minister is keen for us to focus on the policies not the individuals."" The deputy prime minister added: ""I wasn't at school with Nigel Farage. I don't know what songs he sang at school. ""I'm happy to clarify. I did say it's for the public to make up their mind and I did also emphasise that let us play the ball, not the man.""",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn95q9j0yyro,politics,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/6334/live/c8657c60-9e28-11f0-ba41-9d184b600492.jpg,2025-09-30T18:22:55.185000+00:00,950f58834d2ebbf40339eeba2967ba17bb816ea4
934a2d1f5a6e,Call for Miliband to go as second oil refinery loses jobs,,"Oil workers have called for Energy Secretary Ed Miliband to be sacked as a second UK oil refinery moves towards closure. The 125 job losses at the East Lindsey site were announced on the morning of Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer's speech to the Labour Party conference. But Unite's Sharon Graham, head of the union which represents workers at the refinery, warned Sir Keir needed to rescue the government's industrial strategy with fresh investment to protect jobs. Urging him to ""wake up and smell the coffee"", Ms Graham said there could be no growth agenda when the country's industries were shedding jobs. Jamie Dalgetty, Unite branch chairman at the site, said workers had lost faith in Miliband and his junior energy minister, Michael Shanks. ""As part of the National Oil Refinery and Terminal Convenience Committee, I can speak for all of us that we're calling for Ed Miliband and Michael Shanks' removal from their position,"" he said. He added that Miliband needed to support takeover bids for the site, in a similar government intervention to the one taken at the Scunthorpe steel works, also in north Lincolnshire. Ms Graham called on the prime minister to intervene and get the industrial strategy and the Net Zero strategy back on track, because ""it is a disaster"" that two oil refineries are facing closure in less than a year ""under Labour's watch"". ""They've got to have a plan for British industry, you cannot just do this piecemeal,"" she said, comparing Germany's £1 trillion plan for energy diversification to the UK's £50bn. ""It doesn't make any sense for a growth plan if you're allowing oil refineries to shut down and other parts of British industry to shut down,"" she said. ""We need to have the money, like Germany's just done, they've changed their fiscal rules, we need to have the money to invest in these jobs."" The Unite general secretary criticised what she said was a net zero plan for jobs rather than carbon, adding that Chancellor Rachel Reeves should change course by growing the UK economy through investment in jobs.

2ae140198d13,The battle is on for the Conservatives to show they matter,,"The battle is on for the Conservatives to show they matter Laura Kuenssberg Presenter, Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg BBC ""Oh God,"" and then a pause, a sigh, and then, ""Oh God,"" again. Just as a senior Conservative was telling me the party might be able to climb out the terrible hole it's in, news popped up of another of its ranks deserting for Reform UK. Their response? Sad resignation, at yet another resignation. The individual exit of Sarah Atherton, who was briefly a defence minister when the Tories were in power, is not the point. Well over a dozen Conservative MPs or former MPs have made that same move. The question for the Conservatives perhaps this weekend is: is there a point? You don't need me to tell you that the Conservatives are unpopular - deeply so. The hangover from the last election was always going to be nasty after a proper thumping, 14 years in power, and, oh yes, those five prime ministers. But the party's standing has fallen even further since then. No discernible bounce with its new leadership under Kemi Badenoch. No profit from the misery of the government. For the group once regarded as the most successful political operation in the western world, it's dire. Technically, the Tories are still the main opposition. That brings status and meaning. It's Badenoch who gets to ask six questions of the prime minister every week. It's the Conservatives who, as is traditional, are most often called on to respond to government announcements. They still have way more MPs than the Liberal Democrats, or the SNP, and legions more than Reform or the Greens. But politically, it just doesn't feel at this moment that they are the government's hungry main challengers. That's in part because they were smashed to bits in July 2024 and it was always going to take a bit of time to come round. It's in part because the party is so far behind in the polls. It's in part because the government is very deliberately making its arguments against Reform, not their traditional Conservative rivals. As another senior party figure observes, Labour's ""framing of cutting the Tories out is the right one"". It suits Labour and the Lib Dems to treat the Tories as if they are irrelevant. And it's in part, many Conservatives argue, because Badenoch ""just hasn't generated any traction, any attention"" during her time in charge. As the Conservatives arrive in Manchester for their conference, in the very serious aftermath of the attack on Heaton Park synagogue, the primary job is to grab any attention: perhaps the Tory party is smack bang in the middle of a battle to matter at all. Reuters Prime Minister and Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer Like it or not, just as Sir Keir Starmer has discovered, grumpy parties who are not doing well point the finger at their leader. Badenoch has admirers in the Conservative Party for speaking out on particular issues like single-sex spaces, free speech, or declaring that some cultures are in her view ""less valid"" than others. Some of her colleagues applaud her blunt, tell-it-like-it-is manner. But politics is also a business of charm and empathy. A senior Tory told me after the election defeat the party had to ""go everywhere and do a mea culpa, to listen and take a kicking"". But the issue with Badenoch, they say, is ""she is grand... hasn't been anywhere and isn't listening to anyone"". Ouch. With conference about to start, it's almost a Tory tradition to fill the papers and podcasts with gripes about the party leader. She has had some more effective performances at Prime Minister's Questions. Policies are starting to emerge. Money has kept flowing to the party.  One of her backers maintains that although she is still ""finding her way"", she has some of the same ""strength and character as a young Margaret Thatcher"". Thatcher was seen as ""strange and shrill"" when she got the job, but became the party's most successful boss of modern times. But as Badenoch approaches a year in the job, it's becoming harder to find people who'll make that comparison. Whatever Badenoch's personal strengths and failures, there is a different criticism of how she has gone about the job, with a party veteran suggesting, ""there is just no pace, no nimbleness"". Maybe that should have been staring the party in the face: her original pitch for the job was ""Renewal 2030"" - a date past the next general election. During many of her interviews Badenoch has said she wants to take her time working out the right moves for the party, developing credible ideas rather than being rushed. You can expect lots of policy to be unveiled in the next few days. But politics moves incredibly fast, and another source agrees pace is a problem, saying: ""What she misunderstood is you get one chance to introduce yourself to the public – she lost the chance to generate any traction and she won't get that back."" Reform UK leader Nigel Farage was only too happy to step into that ""vacuum"", gaining strength in the polls and grabbing headlines while the Tories were busy making other plans. Getty Images Badenoch after delivering a speech at the Institute of Chartered Accountants' Hall in September Candidly, it is not unusual to hear Conservatives saying freely in private that Badenoch won't be in the job for long, she could be ""out by Christmas"", or ""might not even have to be dragged out"" if the party bombs at the polls in a set of mega elections in May. Indeed, when asked the question herself in a conference warm-up interview, she more or less said: Well, ask me then. Refreshingly honest from a leader who isn't fully in control of her own destiny? Or foolhardy when this is a moment when she ought to be mustering as much authority as she can? The conference gives a shop window to the party and its leader to show what she is made of too. As one senior MP says: ""This conference is about her, and making it clear she has a direction and a sense of where she is going, and it is hers and she is going to lead it – we have this one chance."" ""We understand the polls aren't great, a source close to the party leadership adds. ""There needs to be a bit of understanding from those who are grumbling."" But where is Badenoch trying to lead? ""If I want a can of full fat coke, then I go and buy one, if I like what Reform are saying I'm gonna vote Reform, I'm not going to vote for a party that's not quite there,"" a party insider says. Badenoch's signals on climate change, on leaving the European Convention on Human Rights, tip towards the right of the Conservative spectrum, on territory that right now, Reform have painted in bold primary colours. Bloomberg via Getty Images Reform leader Nigel Farage has grabbed headlines while the Tories were busy making other plans Badenoch is a Brexiteer, a strong advocate of free speech, and seemingly often up for a spat in the latest round of culture wars. But politics is a business - not quite like any other - but a business nonetheless. And many in the party reckon she is going after the wrong customers and ought to be trying to appeal more to soft liberals or soft Tories, rather than to those interested in Reform. ""Frankly, the gap in the market is on the centre right,"" one source says. Some of the current Tory top brass are keen to get the argument onto issues they hope might appeal more to more voters, and it's not stupid to guess it, yes, the economy. One shadow minister says: ""We have to talk about the money in your pocket and trying to articulate what all of Labour's tax rises and debt means to you in terms of the cash in your pocket and the food in your fridge."" With Reform UK in the ascendant, are they the right enemy for the Tories in any case, one source wonders? Their presence on the right means the Conservatives right now don't have the luxury of assuming they will always be the number two. The party used to be ""free to carry on in opposition in our own space – now when the party looks for who its enemy is, is it Labour, Reform or Lib Dems, or it doesn't know?"". According to one source close to the party leadership, in recent years people have struggled to know what the party stands for: ""We have flip-flopped, criss-crossed, gone from [Theresa] May to [Boris] Johnson, to [Rishi] Sunak."" There will be big announcements over the next few days setting out Badenoch's position ""and it will be the job of MPs and councils and everyone to go and sell that message"". Getty Images Badenoch giving a speech earlier this year As party members and associated hangers-on start to arrive in Manchester today, there are reasons to be gloomy for the current leadership. If you look back at the polling, Badenoch is in a worse position according to net satisfaction ratings than John Major, William Hague, Iain Duncan Smith, David Cameron, Theresa May,  Boris Johnson and Rishi Sunak. (If you're wondering, I didn't forget Liz Truss, but she wasn't around long enough to have her popularity measured after nearly a year). ""I don't remember it ever being this bad,"" says one insider, suggesting not just that Badenoch's time will be up before too long, but also that the party has been hollowed out of experience and knowledge, and many of the big-name MPs who have stuck around have, frankly, rather checked out. But one of Badenoch's backers suggests it's the party, not the leadership, that ought to have a word with itself. They told me their colleagues have got a ""messiah complex - ever since Margaret they think there is a leader out there who will lead them to the promised land"". In other words, get your heads down, get your work done, and stop thinking it's all about the person at the top. ""We need to understand real history, not folk history,"" they say, suggesting a new leader would not and could not solve the party's problems on their own. Do it again, and a frontbencher suggests ""people will think, 'Oh God, they haven't changed!'"" But the overall picture for the Tories' top team is as foul as the weather in Manchester which awaits them. ""They're not relevant, they don't matter - that is the big thing the current team have not understood,"" one Tory source worries. ""If it's not resolved soon it's easy to see  how we might be in third or even fourth place"" when it gets to the next election, they add. Not for the first time, you don't need me to remind you - but I will - that politics in the 2020s is a very unpredictable era. There are known unknowns. Might Badenoch pull off a blinding speech this week? Will Labour be patient with Sir Keir until the general election? Will Reform hold together? Will the economy improve? And unknown unknowns that we can't list right now. And anyone who claims to know what's next may as well be trying to sell ice to an Eskimo. The Conservative party has been pronounced more or less gone before. There was even a book published titled ""The Strange Death of Tory England"". Five years later, David Cameron strolled into No 10. But the party is in trouble. Conferences are always an opportunity for political parties, but also a risk. The pressure is on the Tories to show they matter in the next few days, or more on their own side may wonder what they're for.

e7bc4c86a145,Meet the Caerphilly by-election candidates,,"Meet the Caerphilly by-election candidates Getty Images Caerphilly Castle is the second largest in Britain, behind only Windsor Castle Eight politicians are competing in, arguably, the most interesting by-election in the 26-years of Welsh devolution. They are seeking to represent the constituency of Caerphilly in the Welsh Parliament. Prompted by the sudden death of Labour Senedd member Hefin David in August , the poll takes place on 23 October. Here you can read about all of the candidates, in alphabetical order, and their messages to voters. The details were provided by the political parties and candidates, and reflect their views. Steve Aicheler - Welsh Liberal Democrats Welsh Liberal Democrats Who is he? Steve Aicheler lives in Machen with his family and is a community councillor and school governor. He works for a national non-profit organisation promoting entrepreneurship in education and has founded several local businesses. Steve says he is standing to give Caerphilly a strong, independent voice in the Senedd who puts people first. What are his policies? Fix the social care crisis to free up the Welsh NHS and reduce waiting times. Provide 30 hours of free childcare a week for every child aged nine months to four years, so that every parent in Caerphilly has access to affordable and flexible childcare. Prioritise education, ensuring young people in Wales have equal access to opportunity as young people in England. Bring jobs back to Caerphilly, challenging a Cardiff-centric City Deal that has failed to deliver for local people. Protect local services that are under threat from Labour locally and in the Senedd. Anthony Cook - Gwlad Glenn Whitehouse Who is he? Anthony Cook grew up in Cefn Hengoed, lives in Ystrad Mynach and says his family has been ""part of the Rhymney Valley mining history for generations"". He is a father of three children that he takes on ""adventures over Parc Penallta and Gelligaer Common"" and says that, as a boy, he ""played in the shadow of Penallta colliery and caught the C9 bus to Bargoed to go shopping with my nan in a once thriving high street"". He says he understands the ""struggles that have followed the decline of our traditional industries"". The name of his party, Gwlad, means country in Welsh. What are his policies? Help town centres by building homes, siting public services such as polyclinics (centres for GP surgeries, outpatients and minor injuries) there and encouraging evening shop opening, at least from April to October. Reform VAT; as new build is free of the tax but repair is not, making it cheaper to build new on the outskirts of town rather than restore the old centre. The elected Welsh government should run Wales, not boards and panels of the ""great and the good"" which require additional funding to administer and give ministers a way to evade responsibility. End subsidies for renewable energy schemes such as solar farms that are destroying good agricultural land. Oppose Welsh government funding of politically partisan NGOs (non-governmental organisations), eg those that campaign for men to access women's spaces. Gareth Hughes - Green Party Who is he? Gareth Hughes, who lives in Caerphilly, was born in Bangor and educated at Friars Grammar School, Coleg Harlech and the London School of Economics. He has been an apprentice printer, print journalist, university lecturer, researcher and played a prominent role in the early days of housing associations in Wales. He returned to journalism, with the creation of the National Assembly for Wales in the late 1990s, as an ITV Wales political reporter and commentator, later analysing public life for BBC Radio Wales, Radio Cymru and others. What are his policies? Create green jobs for people where they live. Provide better public services - including more evening bus services and warm, safe housing. Build stronger communities with empowered local voices. Promote a fairer, greener future tackling the climate emergency. Gareth Potter - Welsh Conservatives Welsh Conservatives Who is he? Gareth Potter is married with two children and has lived in Ebbw Vale since last year. Born in Pontypool, he grew up on a Trevethin council estate and attended West Monmouth Comprehensive School. He worked for retailers, including Matalan, then in charity retail with the British Heart Foundation before focusing on politics full-time. He was previously a staff member for Conservative South Wales East Senedd member Natasha Asghar and worked, for the last four years, as a campaign manager for Bristol and South Gloucestershire Conservatives. What are his policies? Scrap business rates for small businesses to allow our forgotten high streets to grow, creating more local jobs and reducing unemployment across Caerphilly and growing tourism. Ban mobile phones in schools by rolling out lockable phone pouches across all schools in Caerphilly and ensure children are automatically excluded for carrying knives into school. Push to extend GP services beyond 09:00 BST to 19:00 and review NHS hospital planning which has seen hospitals like Ysbyty Ystrad Fawr designed for A&E services but instead all A&E going to the Grange in Torfaen 30mins away for residents living just yards from Ystrad Fawr. Scrap Wales' 20mph default speed limit and build an M4 relief road south of Newport to support growth in our town and villages across Caerphilly. Keep local services open while cutting council waste, scrapping the Senedd expansion while initiating an Anti-Waste Action Plan. Llŷr Powell - Reform UK Reform UK Who is he? Llŷr Powell has lived and worked in Caerphilly for the last five years and has called the area home for much of his professional life, aside from a brief hiatus to work in the House of Commons in 2024. He has worked in communications in public, political and charitable organisations, including roles in political communications and public affairs, where he has used his platform to highlight issues facing the left-behind communities of south Wales. He is a fluent Welsh speaker, and describes himself as an enthusiastic supporter of grassroots Welsh rugby and a keen follower of the national side. What are his policies? Protect the NHS, free at the point of delivery, with free prescriptions. Champion shorter waiting lists, more frontline staff, proper funding and an upgrade for Ysbyty Ystrad Fawr. Support local high streets, be a strong voice for Caerphilly's local economy and prioritise attracting much-needed investment to create more opportunities and jobs in this area. End the Nation of Sanctuary policy, which has wasted £55m of taxpayers' money. Fight to keep libraries open as the Labour council wants to close 10 of them while sitting on almost £190m in reserves as council tax keeps rising. Ensure reserves are spent on local communities not wasteful projects. Get Wales moving again by pushing to reverse Labour's 20mph speed limits, which are negatively impacting Caerphilly's economy and putting businesses off investing in the region. Back better and safer transport links. Roger Quilliam - UKIP Who is he? Roger Quilliam has been a member of UKIP's National Executive Committee since 2024. The party says he has worked for over two years closely with party leader Nick Tenconi in activism and citizen journalism for UKIP, Turning Point UK, and Disciples of Christ. UKIP says he campaigns against mass immigration, communism, liberalism, and in favour of patriotism, nationalism, and traditionalism and that his core values are rooted in family, community, national identity, justice, and law and order. What are his policies? Abolish the Senedd. Freeze immigration for a minimum of five years. Mass deportations and remigration. Reinstate Christianity back into the heart of government and put Britons first. Richard Tunnicliffe - Welsh Labour Welsh Labour Who is he? Richard Tunnicliffe has lived in Caerphilly with his Troedyrhiw-born wife Lynda for 26 years and they raised their three sons in the town. He has worked as an accountant and financial analyst and runs a publishing company with his wife, specialising in Welsh translations of popular children's books. He was encouraged to become more active in the local party by Hefin David, who was mentoring him to be a candidate in next year's Senedd election at the time of his death. What are his policies? Honour Hefin David's legacy by listening to constituents and solving community problems together. Champion Bevan's NHS by working proactively with local health service leaders. Earn trust by doing what I say I will do and never over-promising. Calling for the council to prioritise protecting libraries across the borough and use any future funding to do so. Lindsay Whittle - Plaid Cymru Plaid Cymru Who is he? Lindsay Whittle was born in Caerphilly town, he lives in Abertridwr, was raised on the Penyrheol council estate and attended Cwm Ifor Primary School. A councillor for Penyrheol since 1976, he was Caerphilly council leader from 1999 to 2004 and 2008 to 2011, and has been Plaid Cymru group leader on the council since 2022. From 2011 to 2016 he was a South Wales East assembly membe r (as Senedd members were previously known). What are his policies? Campaign for a fair funding settlement for Wales to help protect local services and oppose cuts, recently opposing plans to close public libraries and a leisure centre across the Caerphilly constituency. Attract quality jobs through Plaid Cymru's Making Wales Work plan, giving locally-owned small and medium-sized businesses and co-operatives in Caerphilly more help and adjusting business rates to boost town centres. Billions spent on rail projects in England, such as HS2 and the Oxford-Cambridge line, bring extra money to Scotland and Northern Ireland but not Wales. Releasing cash for Wales would help pay for local improvements. Invest in primary healthcare: Lindsay Whittle supports Plaid Cymru's plan to set up elective care hubs to get people seen faster, with a triage system to speed up referrals between GPs and hospitals.

b27281916b71,"Trump trusts Blair, others don't - could he govern Gaza?",,"Trump trusts Blair, others don't - could he govern Gaza? James Landale Diplomatic correspondent Getty Images As prime minister of the UK for more than 10 years, Sir Tony Blair was a master of political compromise. He was seen as a deft negotiator of the centre ground, triangulating his way out of the straitjacket of traditional left-right politics. But if there were peace in Gaza and he were summoned to help govern what was left, would even Teflon Tony – as he was once known – have the political wiles to keep all sides happy and the guns silent? His putative role is still not clear. Donald Trump's 20-point peace plan envisages an international transitional body that would oversee the governance of post-war Gaza. The US president would chair this so-called ""Board of Peace"" and Sir Tony, aged 72, would be a member. He's a ""good man, very good man"", Trump told reporters. Sir Tony's presence on this hypothetical body would come as no surprise. The former prime minister has been closely involved in drawing up Gaza peace proposals for months. He has been working with Jared Kushner, Trump's son-in-law, and Ron Dermer, a key adviser to Israel's prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu. In August, Sir Tony attended a high-level meeting with Trump at the White House to discuss a post-war strategy for the Strip. A month earlier he also held talks with Steve Witkoff, the president's chief envoy, at the White House. In a statement, Sir Tony unsurprisingly lavished praise on the Trump plan, describing it as ""bold and intelligent"" and ""the best chance of ending two years of war, misery and suffering"". He said the proposals created the possibility not only ""of Israelis and Palestinians finding a path to peace"" but also ""a broader regional and global alliance to counter the forces of extremism and promote peace and prosperity between nations"". And that is the key point: this is what Sir Tony has been pushing for decades in different roles. As prime minister from 1997, he supported the Clinton administration's efforts to find peace in the region. On the very day he left office in June 2007, he was appointed special envoy for a so-called Quartet - representing the US, Russia, the EU and UN – designed to coordinate peace efforts, a role he held until 2015. His supporters insist his remit at the Quartet was economic development and he was excluded from the political process. Since then his business and other interests – including his Tony Blair Institute for Global Change - have kept him firmly plugged into the region. Diplomats say this is what makes Sir Tony unique; he is trusted by the Trump administration, he has an unparalleled network in the Middle East, and he has long experience of dealing with both Israeli and Palestinian leaderships. Nick Hopton, director general of the Middle East Association, said the former UK PM was the only western leader one could imagine taking the role. ""He's got the credibility and experience having been embroiled in the Middle East for 24 years,"" he said. ""But it will work only if he is able to have the confidence of Donald Trump and also if he is not seen as being manipulated by Benjamin Netanyahu. He also needs to demonstrate he has the confidence of the Palestinian Authority leadership."" But – and it is a big but – Sir Tony would come to the role with much baggage. To some he is a divisive figure, to others worse. Role in Iraq invasion 'not forgotten' His role in joining the 2003 invasion of Iraq - based on incorrect reports about the country's weapons of mass destruction – still tarnishes his reputation in the region and has led some to accuse him of war crimes. Francesca Albanese, UN special rapporteur on rights in the occupied Palestinian territories, was blunt. ""Tony Blair? Hell no. Hands off Palestine,"" she posted on social media. ""Shall we meet in The Hague perhaps?"", a reference to the location of the International Criminal Court. Sir Simon Fraser, former head of the UK Foreign Office, said Sir Tony had shown genuine interest in the Palestinian issue and was trusted in Washington, Israel and the Gulf. ""But the Arab street has not forgotten Iraq,"" he said. ""The future oversight of Gaza needs a broader base and cannot look like an American/British enterprise."" Hamas, for one, did not seem keen. Husam Badran, a member of the group's political bureau, said this week Sir Tony should be on trial for the US invasion of Iraq, not administering Gaza. ""Any plan linked to Blair is an ill omen,"" he said. Some Palestinians and others also see Sir Tony as historically always being too close to Israeli and US positions. Nomi Bar-Yaacov, a former international peace negotiator, said: ""I don't think the Palestinians trust him at all. I think they view him as a colossal failure during the time that he was the Quartet envoy."" Even UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer, who used his Labour conference speech on Tuesday to praise the Trump peace plan, chose to make no mention of the key role his predecessor might play. As Middle East peace envoy for eight long years, Sir Tony was supposed to help build up the Palestinian Authority so that one day it would be in a fit state to run a Palestinian state. But few would argue that this is where the PA is today. Palestinians also argue he did not do enough to push back against illegal settlements and settler violence. Some have claimed he should have made a stronger case for Palestinian statehood, focusing instead on economic development. Getty Images As former Quartet special envoy Tony Blair met Benjamin Netanyahu in 2014 The interesting question is why Sir Tony still feels the need to be involved in trying to find an end to the fighting in the Middle East. He has long seen himself as a peace-maker, after his success negotiating the Good Friday Agreement that helped reduce conflict in Northern Ireland. But as a political correspondent throughout the 1990s and 2000s, and thus a close observer of the Blair years of power, I was always struck by his dogged refusal to accept that he might have failed to persuade someone of his point of view. It niggled at him. To that extent, the Middle East may be seen by Sir Tony as unfinished business. Health Secretary Wes Streeting told PA Media Sir Tony's role would ""raise eyebrows"" because of the Iraq war and said he had an ""incredible legacy"" in Northern Ireland of building peace that lasted. ""If he can bring that skill set to bear in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, with the support of Israelis, Palestinians and other regional powers, then so much the better,"" Mr Streeting said. In truth, the role of Blair is a second order issue. He will have a job to do only if this peace plan succeeds and survives, and there is no guarantee of that. Far more important are the differences between both sides and details that are as yet unresolved by the framework outlined by the White House. Sanam Vakil, Middle East programme director at the Chatham House think tank, said: ""The focus on Tony Blair and his legacy of western intervention in Iraq masks the real challenges of this peace framework that lacks details, timelines and deliverables - and does not yet have Palestinian or Israeli buy-in, let alone leadership. ""Without significant work to move beyond 20 points on a piece of paper, this plan will be another version of cosmetic diplomacy that embeds structural injustice and deprives Palestinians of agency and sovereignty."" So maybe what really matters is not perhaps the psychodrama of Sir Tony Blair and the controversial opinions people hold about him. A more relevant question may be more what role any transitional authority in Gaza might play and whether Sir Tony has the right skills and experience to play a significant role. If his job would be to coordinate with Gulf leaders and the White House, that is one thing. But if he were being asked effectively to govern Gaza, overseeing the reconstruction, the security and economic development of the Strip, that is quite another. ""Viceroy Blair?"" one diplomat texted me. ""That will never wash.""",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c89d5938w3ko,politics,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/ebc5/live/f21cee50-9e2b-11f0-ba41-9d184b600492.jpg,2025-09-30T19:31:18.674000+00:00,0664df86f879ca2d24ecbbd482679548e1a50884
5fb84056c04c,Why Starmer wants to keep talking about Farage,,"Why Starmer wants to keep talking about Farage Matt Chorley Presenter, BBC Radio 5 Live Getty Images ""Know yourself and know your enemy,"" wrote Sun Tzu, the Chinese military adviser from the 6th century BC. ""In a hundred battles, you will never be defeated."" Sir Keir Starmer might not quite have 100 battles, but he's got a fair few on his hands: with his party, with the bond markets, with the mayor of Greater Manchester. And yet the prime minister, who still helms an enormous Commons majority, has a resolute focus on who the singular enemy is. And it's a party with five MPs: Reform UK. Time and again, Sir Keir has chosen during Labour's conference week to focus on Nigel Farage, having written off the Conservatives as ""dead"" and barely mentioning the Lib Dems, Greens or other parties eating into Labour support from the left. 'Different fight' But in the lanyard-laden fringes and bars in Liverpool, there is a live conversation about the wisdom of this strategy. Does naming your enemy so publicly help bring focus to the government's operation and attack? Or does it risk elevating Reform UK, a new party with no record in government, to an elite status which only serves to bolster rather than damage them? Reform UK love it. Whenever the prime minister goes out of his way to mock or ridicule them during PMQs, Farage and his MPs including Richard Tice and Lee Anderson slap their thighs in pantomime laughter, believing they are being paid a high compliment. At the weekend, Sir Keir said the fight with Reform is different. ""Most elections have always been Labour or Conservative,"" he said. ""This is a different election that we are facing.  We have not had a proposition like Reform in this country ever before. This is a different fight. It is a fight about who we are as a country, it goes to the soul of our future."" Some in Liverpool this week have likened this to Joe Biden's repeated refrain against Donald Trump in 2020 that they were locked in a ""battle for the soul of the nation"". However, some within Labour are unsure if the strategy of attacking Farage is the right approach. One backbench MP from the North East told me that those in Downing Street advising the PM ""don't get it"" - and don't represent ""white, working class council estates"" with voters that worry about immigration. ""They tend to be the frothy coffee drinking liberal lefties. They are speaking to the same people,"" they added. Others suggest that keeping Kemi Badenoch's Conservative party alive, or at least their share of the vote up, is needed to split the vote on the right. One senior minister said: ""The Tories being dead doesn't help us, it just pushes people to Reform. It's a bit like how at the last general election we needed the Lib Dems to do well, as they took seats off the Tories rather than us. ""But this is worse, because both Tory and Labour are voters shifting to Reform. In places from Barnsley to Bexley, we need the right vote to split, and then we need to squeeze Lib Dems and the Greens to come down the middle."" John Denham, a minister under Tony Blair and Gordon Brown in the last Labour government, agrees. ""It makes no sense to me to elevate Reform to that position, even if you think the Tories are dead,"" he told me on BBC Radio 5 Live. ""We have four years left of this government. The idea that the only thing we think we can offer in four years time is 'well, at least we're not Reform'... surely to God we can do something with the huge majority we've got and the time we've got to tell a convincing story that marginalizes Reform."" He suggested that there were a ""really very small"" group of people who might switch between Reform and Labour. The latest YouGov poll suggests just over half of Labour's 2024 voters are sticking with them. Some 12% have switched to Reform, and 4% to the Conservatives, while another 13% have gone to the Lib Dems, 12% to the Greens, and others have gone to the SNP and Plaid Cymru, suggesting losses to the left are far greater than to the right. 'We love it' However, Tom Lubbock, from pollsters JL Partners, thinks focussing on Reform UK is ""extremely smart politics"". ""If you look at Labour voters who are undecided at the moment, if you force that choice and say it's a choice between Keir Starmer and Nigel Farage, a lot of them who are undecided will come back into the Labour boat. ""And, you know, there's a lot of time to go before that next election, but it's actually very smart at the moment to make that the choice."" Previous party leaders and governments have faced this choice about how to deal with insurgent parties under Farage. Ed Davey, the Lib Dem leader, made around 30 references to Farage in his conference speech last week. Simon Lewis, a former director of communications for Gordon Brown, said: ""The risk is that you are seen to be taking your opponent too seriously. ""Multiple references to his name probably gets people thinking, goodness, these guys are really scared about Reform. And I think you do have to be very careful."" Number 10 insiders defend the strategy, and insist the PM is adamant that the country is at a crossroads, and he thinks it is his responsibility to stand up to Farage. So what do Reform make of party leaders falling over themselves to namecheck them and their leader? ""It made us laugh,"" said Gawain Towler, a former press adviser to Farage. ""We love it. We absolutely love it! It's so preposterous.""

3d99c7fb1bf0,Reeves pre-emptively justifies tax rises,,"In Liverpool Rachel Reeves seemed to be floating a pre-emptive argument ahead of possible tax rises in her November Budget. The key line in the chancellor's speech in relation to the Budget was her linking of tough decisions ""in coming months"" to global headwinds and a critical reassessment of the long-term productivity performance of the UK economy, about to be delivered by the Office for Budget Responsibility. ""We will face further tests, with choices to come, made all the harder by harsh global headwinds and long-term damage to the economy, which is becoming ever clearer,"" she said. This prepares the government's argument if there does need to be further tax rises, even significant ones at the Budget. Firstly, they will blame the broad global economic backdrop, of trade wars, actual wars and rising government interest rates. ""The world has changed,"" the chancellor told the Today programme. Secondly, the OBR's reassessment of the UK's long-term economic trends is revealing ""ever clearer"" evidence of ""long-term damage"" which she will blame on the record of her predecessors. The other notable call was for ""responsible management of public finances"" against opposition voices and those in her own party. Other than that, this was relatively light on policies. The policies that most of the country are the most interested in - what is in the Budget - have not been nailed down, and depend on the ping pong about to start with the OBR over its forecasting process. It is on that, where we did get new news today. The chancellor confirmed publicly that she agreed with the International Monetary Fund about changing the fiscal dance that has created non-stop speculation about tax changes. The OBR forecast by law has to happen twice a year, but that could now only happen in full once a year. There are various options. This is a tacit admission that after whatever emerges from the Budget, everyone would benefit from a period of stability, and that has not been the case over the past year. Elsewhere she repeated the idea that the election promises not to increase the main tax rates were still in place. When asked if VAT could rise, she said: ""The manifesto commitments stand."" This appears to connect the commitments to a state of the world that could change. As the Chief Secretary to the PM Darren Jones said: ""The manifesto commitments stand today."" Those manifesto commitments are clearly under pressure, if the OBR's calculations go against the Treasury. Her interpretation of how flexible they are was revealing. She wants to protect pay packets and ""not put up the prices in shops"". That would appear to rule out a straightforward rise in the rate of VAT, which would directly raise bills. There are many other options, depending on the size of the gap - to be revealed to her by the OBR this week - from scrapping some tax breaks and allowances, especially on housing and pensions, to extending the freeze on tax thresholds. The changes made by the OBR to the UK's underlying rate of growth could add considerably to the gap in the public finances Reeves has to bridge in the Budget. The draft details will be presented to her on Friday. It is then and only then that the real work of translating a series of tax proposals into a Budget starts in earnest. The government will also seek to persuade the OBR that its policy moves, from infrastructure plans, to closer ties with Europe, can help long-term growth. Today was about leaving some options open, at a tricky time. The extent of tax rises, and who gets hit, is still very much up for grabs.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cj6x07j9e43o,politics,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/b00d/live/35d04c80-9dcf-11f0-9f23-2534d63ace40.jpg,2025-09-29T16:36:04.080000+00:00,49bd84822a5e22116dd9d6bf818121ae5ed450d3
60200561be67,Can Labour reverse 'desperate loss of faith' from business?,,"Can Labour reverse 'desperate loss of faith' from business? Simon Jack Business editor WPA Pool/Getty Images One of the key audiences that the prime minister and the chancellor will have to convince at this year's Labour conference are the business leaders they targeted with a charm offensive before the election last July. The party trumpeted itself as ""the natural party of business"" and Rachel Reeves told anyone and everyone that this would be ""the most pro-business government this country has ever seen"". Labour had some big business beasts backing them. Billionaire mobile phone tycoon John Caudwell - a long-time Conservative supporter - switched his backing to Labour . Some 120 business leaders signed a letter which read: ""We, as leaders and investors in British business, believe that it is time for a change. For too long now, our economy has been beset by instability, stagnation, and a lack of long-term focus. ""Labour has shown it has changed and wants to work with business to achieve the UK's full economic potential."" But post-election, the party sent a different message - warning of tough choices and hard times ahead, and delivered a Budget to prove it. That Budget, says John Caudwell, with its £25bn rise in employers' National Insurance, undid a lot of the goodwill the chancellor had garnered. ""I think there was a desperate loss of faith from the business community in general from the last Budget,"" he says. ""I think people were shocked at the level of negative components for businesses."" On top of that NI rise, the National Living Wage was hiked by an inflation-busting 6.7%, with a rise of 16% for 18 to 20-year-olds. Mr Caudwell says he understands that Labour needed to raise money to shore up the public finances but felt it hit some sectors unduly hard. ""Even if you say they needed to be done, certain aspects were very unfair. So if you look at the increase in employers' NI, that really badly hit those businesses that employ tens of thousands of people on low wages, because they got hit by minimum wage and they got hit by the NI."" PA John Caudwell says businesses were shocked at ""the level of negative components"" they faced after the last Budget Other small business owners have also told the BBC they have lost confidence. Rachel Carrell is the boss of childcare firm Koru Kids and signed that letter in 2024. She says she hopes the government can restore business confidence over the rest of the parliament. ""I wouldn't sign that letter today but they've got three or four years to turn this around. That's a really long time."" She believes there's an opportunity to fix things in the upcoming Budget, but says ""they need to move quickly"". While anecdotal evidence of crumbling business confidence is not hard to find, official measures show a mixed picture. The Institute of Directors' confidence measure shows a steep fall after the last election, which compilers put down to immediate warnings issued by the government once in power that tough times and tough choices lay ahead. That was duly delivered on by the Budget and has hovered near those lows ever since. However, the government's favourite index to quote is the Lloyds Bank confidence survey, which shows confidence on the future is much more robust. Other measures, including the ICAEW and the S&P PMI measures, tend to support a more gloomy outlook. That in turn is supported by the number of businesses looking to recruit. Job vacancies have been on a downward trend since the Covid pandemic and there are 150,000 fewer staff on payrolls now than there were before the Budget bombshell, with a large part of those jobs going in hospitality. However, there is widespread hope among smaller businesses that the long-promised overhaul of business rates will come soon and in their favour. The government points understandably to the enormous amounts of money pledged recently when tech royalty from Apple, Nvidia, Microsoft and others met real royalty at US President Donald Trump's recent state visit. John Caudwell welcomed it too. ""I hear a lot of negativity about government - we hear about rich people leaving and they are useful to the UK economy, but they're not as useful as the £150bn of inward investment that we've got coming into the country to create high-paid jobs in high-technological businesses. So we have to get a balanced view on that."" Mark Brearley runs a trolley and tray manufacturing and export business in Peckham, south London. He is less impressed with the razzamatazz surrounding the tech billionaires and their largesse. ""I'm sure it's very important to get these racy high-growth sectors to invest here. But what about the less exciting bits of the economy - the ones who are always here? We feel forgotten. ""I was hopeful that a new government would give us some help but all my costs have gone up - my business rates have doubled. I'm more cautious about investing in a new machine, a new product, hiring a new person."" The new Employment Rights Bill , which confers greater rights and protections on employees from day one, is also adding to employers' reluctance to take on new staff. Mark Brearley says small businesses like his feel forgotten The government has made much of its plans to sweep away impediments to economic growth and has seen that acknowledged by some of the biggest investors in UK infrastructure. Just months after Labour entered Downing Street, Scottish Power announced a £24bn UK investment. Keith Anderson, chief executive of Scottish Power, says: ""The government has taken on the planning bogeyman to unlock growth and get us building. That's why the UK is now Iberdrola's biggest investment destination globally."" Rain Newton-Smith, director general of the employers group the CBI, also gives the government high marks on the international stage. ""I think this government have navigated really difficult geopolitics. We've got a better deal with the US than others, we're forging a closer relationship with Europe and they got the deal with India. ""They've got a lot of work done internationally, and that does count. But they've really got to dial up delivery, and make sure that they they learn from the mistakes of last autumn."" Business confidence is a vital but fragile thing. It's a key ingredient for any government hoping that economic growth will pay for its other spending commitments - on heath, defence and welfare. Labour has a job on its hands at conference, and at the Budget, to restore the animal spirits of UK business.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn0xyxnyz48o,politics,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/7aa5/live/803f8e10-9af1-11f0-89b4-1b2d09c610c7.jpg,2025-09-29T06:29:26.809000+00:00,4012358ec77c35c2ca0ec06f7ff0a9cbde553a3f
f0865c91c474,How much trouble is Labour in - and is the PM the right man for the job?,,"How much trouble is Labour in - and is the PM the right man for the job? Laura Kuenssberg Presenter, Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg BBC Sir Keir Starmer achieved what many sage minds in Westminster believed was impossible. Labour smashed itself to bits in 2019. But Sir Keir put the party back together and swept back to power with an epic majority five years later. Yet, turn on the radio or glance at the headlines and Labour appears to be flirting with the unthinkable – giving him his P45. In the last few days I've spoken to 30 people across government and the party -  ministers, MPs, advisers - to try to work out, as the prime minister makes his way to Labour's annual party conference in Liverpool, how much trouble is he really in? ""How many more data points do you need to see that he is just not very good at being prime minister?"" Unforgiving as that sounds, the Whitehall figure who posed that question is far from the only person who has seen Starmer's government up close to conclude that fundamentally, the prime minister is just not suited to many aspects of the job. For months polling has suggested the public feels the same. Sir Keir is an intelligent, incredibly diligent, serious-minded politician who has achieved extraordinary things. But time and again the same problems are raised, summed up brutally by another senior figure: ""His judgement on people has proven to be flawed, see endless staffing resets."" ""His judgement on policy is flawed, hence U-turns, and he can't communicate, and has been unpopular in the public's eyes for a long time."" Others point to a slow pace of decision making in Downing Street, suggesting the prime minister thinks ""too like a chairman, not a chief executive,"" says another insider. And ""he only gets to the right answer having exhausted all the other options,"" rather than moving fast using a gut political instinct. Another senior party figure says: ""He doesn't think like a leader."" Getty Images Everyone in the Labour party is fed up with months of shocking polls. But others are fed up of colleagues complaining about the boss, whether the small number who do so in public, or the much higher number who do so in private. ""It's like being England manager,"" one cabinet minister jokes. ""Everyone thinks they can do a better job."" You can hear the frustration in others' voices, highlighting the ""outstanding job"" Starmer has done on the world stage – wrangling President Donald Trump, or leading support for Ukraine. ""He hasn't put a foot wrong,"" when it comes to foreign policy, says a cabinet minister. Another praises the ""sensible changes"" the prime minister has just made to Downing Street, saying ""people now are now in jobs that will suit their abilities better"" after the reshuffle, and promising the public will soon see the benefit. There can be no hiding from a very messy few weeks, with the forced exits of Angela Rayner and Lord Mandelson , and the circus around the Mayor of Greater Manchester Andy Burnham's not very hidden ambition. But there are other believers in what they see as Starmer's steady and relentless leadership, as one party source jokes: ""There were a couple of weeks where we couldn't get of bed without accidentally tearing our own arms off."" They predict ""that could all go away if we have a decent couple of months"". Perhaps. What even some of the prime minister's staunchest allies believe is that, he must explain more clearly, and vigorously, to the party - and to all of us - what the government is actually doing and why. Getty Images Sir Keir himself admitted as much in the summer, saying: ""We haven't always told our story as well as we should."" So in the next few days, and live on the programme tomorrow, expect the prime minister to try hard to make a clearer pitch to the country. After a horrible few weeks, aides say the prime minister is in a ""better place, clearer about the argument he wants to make"". Announcements like the Hillsborough Law, the returns deal with France, and yesterday's confirmation that ministers will go ahead with digital ID cards will convey, No 10 hopes, a sense of momentum. And you can expect him to build on the argument he's been making about patriotism in politics, trying to reclaim some of the territory Reform UK have been trying to grab. There are two problems though. Firstly, even Starmer's biggest fans in government know fluid communication is not his strong point. He doesn't see the camera, or the TV sofa as his friend. A strong defender of Starmer tells me: ""I wish he was better at telling a story, people don't understand how deeply he feels it and how passionate he is, but he personally isn't good at it."" Secondly, and according to one senior MP this is the bigger issue: ""We're just not clear about what we are doing or who we are for."" Another staffer tells me: ""There is no fire, no passion, no vision – we are timid and flat-footed."" Even if the prime minister suddenly developed the silky charm and persuasiveness of George Clooney, or the bombastic nature of Piers Morgan, the question becomes, what is the story he wants to tell? Multiple exits from the No 10 communications team tell you that working this out is not an easy task. Getty Images One source says: ""Until we know the story we are trying to tell we will get buffeted around."" Is reforming schools, hospitals or welfare at the top of the list?  Building houses or becoming a green ""superpower""? Or being at the forefront of technology, or protecting our borders, or growing the economy? Or is it now this priority of ""patriotic renewal""? If you have that many priorities, how can the public understand what you care about most? To govern is to choose after all, if you're not doing much choosing, are you doing much governing? One source suggested frankly, even for those who work closely alongside him, it's often hard to work out what the prime minister thinks, telling me: ""He often appears unknowable."" ""He compartmentalises his life - personal, professional, and political - in a way that works for him, but leaves colleagues unsure of his true views."" In a sense it seems extraordinary that the leader of a political party can leave colleagues unsure of their views, after 14 months in office, and four years as leader in opposition. But his early years in charge were dominated by internal fights for control of the party, and over antisemitism, not over ideas. One source recalls: ""We had lots of fights to win in opposition, but they were never, ever about what the parties' priorities should be."" Getty Images The prime minister has a huge chance in the next few days to spell out to his party, and to the public, exactly where he stands, and exactly what he believes in specific terms. After a horrible summer, and a very tricky year, it is desperately needed if the party is to get back on track. ""There is a way through this, but he has to assert himself,"" says one cabinet minister, desperate for the prime minister to remind his party and the country why they elected him in the first place. Ministers and Downing Street are frustrated by chatter about Starmer's leadership, especially the behaviour of Andy Burnahm in recent days. ""Everyone needs to just shut up and get on with their own jobs,"" one government source says. Another says: ""the Burnham stuff is just ridiculous."" ""He doesn't have a seat in Parliament, wouldn't necessarily find or win one,"" and one minister snipes, ""any chance to have a dig – Burnham will never miss an opportunity"". They predict confidently, the party ""doesn't want regicide or disruption, they just want us to do well"". But leadership chatter is a symbol that all is not well. And that sense of assurance is far from universal. One senior figure outside government warns me, ""they don't realise they are in serious, serious trouble – this is literally a head-in-hands-moment"". There are real discussions in different pockets of the Labour movement about whether Starmer should still lead the party. And the sweaty bars and fringe meetings of the party conference provide the perfect backdrop for those out to make trouble. Yet it's clear from multiple conversations that it's not only mischief makers who are pondering what to do. ""Frustration is wide and deep,"" says a senior MP. One insider who has been part of conversations about the chances of changing the leader says, ""it's not flighty people, not just newbies without a clue, they're not idiots"". Even on the government payroll one minister worries, ""the country is desperate for a disrupter, and it's just not who he is,"" questioning whether Starmer can be the right man for this political moment. Here's the fundamental question, asked by many, expressed by one senior figure: ""Do we think Keir can improve? People don't think he can, although they wish he would. But there is a sinking feeling."" Sign up for the Off Air with Laura K newsletter to get Laura Kuenssberg's expert insight and insider stories every week, emailed directly to you. Some MPs are even pointing to the example of the Democrats' failure to tell former President Joe Biden to go , which left the party no time to build up another candidate. The source continues we ""dread and fear being the people who didn't do what was necessary to stop the country electing Farage"". Others would baulk at that comparison. The prime minister has only had just over a year in charge. The problems Labour inherited on taking office were profound. Centre left political parties in many countries are grappling with how to deal with demographics, immigration, an era where public money is very tight. There are more than three years until the next general election. There is time to start wrestling with all of that. The electorate has shown politicians they can move in droves, and fast. So many ministers plead for patience. One wishes his colleagues would not just ""get a grip"", but remember they were all elected on a promise to stop political chaos. ""Anyone who thinks the challenging world is rectified by a change in leader, I don't understand the rationale. When we look at how unstable things are, and talk about leadership, how would the bond markets respond, when our primary responsibility is stabilising the economy?"" Another source dismisses those predicting doom in the party, ""nothing is irrevocable, and nothing is inevitable"". Perhaps the rebooted No 10 will start getting better results. Perhaps, and No 10 fervently hopes, Sir Keir will wow the crowds at conference, and display why he earned the job to start with, and won the election in the first place. The prime minister's position is also, frankly,  protected by the fact there is no consensus about who could do a better job than him. Even if Labour were to conclude universally, which it is far from doing, that Starmer's leadership is somehow beyond repair, that reality is a smack in the face for those who'd seek a change. As one Whitehall figure suggests: ""problem one, is he good at being PM? No. But next problem, do you have an upgrade? Hmm..."" Labour's answer to that question right now, notwithstanding Andy Burnham's antics, is, ""well, we're not sure"". AFP via Getty Images A lack of clarity over who would be next, and fresh memories of the political shambles of the Conservatives' change of leader, both put the brakes on anyone seeking to make a change any time soon. As ever in politics two things that might appear to be contradictory are in fact, both true. Is it mad on paper for Labour to be even vaguely contemplating changing their leader so soon, without an obvious strong successor, when they ran on a promise of no drama? For many, yes, it's crackers. But is the discussion about whether the PM can carry on like this just idle chit-chat? Not at all. One senior figure sums up the situation with no pleasure – discussion about changing the Labour leader ""is both lunatic, and real"". The leadership's hope is that a strong conference without too many noises off, and an effective speech from the platform by the prime minister himself might calm everything down. A political get together, a party conference for the politicians, members, and associated hangers-on, would never transform a prime minister's fortunes with the public overnight. But it can make a big difference to how a party feels about itself. For Starmer to have a chance of restoring his position with the public he must first, once again, persuade his party that he is the man for the job. But without restoring his party's faith in him, convincing Labour of his merits, his own position could well be at risk. One insider who knows the prime minister well suggested: ""He is not a natural explainer… he states positions but doesn't repeatedly argue for them. ""This has led to an aversion to debate, treating persuasion as weakness."" Yet politics is, above all else,  the art of persuasion. That is perhaps the dilemma for Labour. That is the problem for him.

0f4766085b7c,What lessons can Starmer learn from world leaders on fighting Reform?,,"What lessons can Starmer learn from world leaders on fighting Reform? Iain Watson Political correspondent BBC ""The country is at a crossroads,"" Sir Keir Starmer is expected to declare in a speech just ahead of the annual Labour conference, which kicks off this weekend. The prime minister will suggest there are two paths to choose: one is the way of ""division and decline"" with Reform UK, or Labour's route – unity and progress. For some in Labour's ranks, the leadership's response, so far, to the rise of Reform has gone down like a lead balloon. Not nimble enough, not impassioned, is the message. With Labour lagging in the polls, expect to hear the anti-Reform rhetoric ramped up - but exactly how to burst the populist bubble has proved challenging. The response to Reform leader Nigel Farage's proposal this week to end existing migrants' Indefinite Leave to Remain suggested that Labour hadn't quite settled on the most effective line of attack. Chancellor Rachel Reeves questioned Reform's alleged cost-savings and denounced the policy as a gimmick; Labour Party chair Anna Turley highlighted unanswered questions but also raised the prospect of families being broken up; the MP Sarah Owen also mentioned family break-up but added that this was ""morally abhorrent"". None of these responses were mutually exclusive but they differed in tone, and perhaps point to a tension between denouncing Reform as not serious - or as all too serious. Just a year ago, the Conservatives were Labour's principal opponents. The government now has to grapple with an insurgent party with no track record in office and which is eroding Labour's, not just the Conservatives', vote. And it's not a problem that's unique to the UK. Reuters Sir Keir Starmer will be eyeing the lessons from Australia, after Prime Minister Anthony Albanese won a second term There is concern amongst centre-left parties internationally that a rejuvenated right is doing well at the ballot box and seemingly winning the battle of ideas. So how do they fight back? The think-tank, the IPPR; the Center for American Progress and the pro-leadership Labour Together organisation have brought together an array of progressive leaders to share their electoral lessons at a major conference in London on Friday. Their big tent encompasses not just international socialist and social democratic parties but also Greens, Liberals - and even some former Conservatives. Labour strategists are looking enviously at their Australian counterparts who won a second term in May. Anthony Albanese's government tackled the immigration issue - in which they had felt vulnerable - soon after taking power and tightened rules on student and temporary visas. They were able to demonstrate a steady reduction in net migration before polling day and made the political case for continuing to bring in skilled labour - defeating an opponent who called for bigger reductions. But there won't be a single template for Labour to follow. The Spanish Socialist PM Pedro Sanchez's approach is to not to bang on about immigration but when necessary to defend it as a contributor to a growing economy, while the Danish Social Democrat PM Mette Federikson has been taking a hard line on asylum. There is nonetheless a shared recognition that a defence of the status quo is no longer sustainable. The IPPR's Harry Quilter-Pinner says it would be a mistake to follow ""the playbook of the right"". He tells me: ""The populist right's story is one of extraction – of just taking. Progressives should reject this - it stokes divisions."" He suggests when it comes to economic migration there needs to be an assessment of whether - and how quickly -  a UK citizen could be trained to do a job. He believes more of a fuss should be made of becoming British citizen, and there needs to be an expectation of what new citizens would contribute. Claire Ainsley, who was Sir Keir Starmer's policy chief when he was in opposition, is now overseeing a project on centre-left renewal at the Progressive Policy Institute, and her advice is to grow the ""seeds of doubt"" about Reform in the electorate's minds in the three years between now and the election. She believes that while people are happy to cast a protest vote, they currently question whether Reform are really a government in waiting - so challenging them on whether their policies hold together, or whether their numbers add up, is a way of undermining their support. But it does also mean doing more to tackle the core issue. She says the party leadership realised ""the previous set of answers on immigration were not going to wash with the British public that want to see action"", and says she was encouraged by Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood's promise that ""nothing is off the table"" in tackling illegal migration. But tackling Reform isn't just about immigration. Ms Ainsley says it's about people feeling worse off and not feeling they have got a fair deal on the economy,  and a sense that other people are getting treated better than them. The current buzzword around government is ""contribution"" - convincing people that they will be beneficiaries and not just contributors to a welfare state. This is likely to be developed further in the main Labour conference speeches in Liverpool next week. Previewing that, Labour Together published a report this week. In it, chief policy officer Morgan Wild argues that over the past decades, the link between what people put in and what they get out has all but disappeared. He says: ""It is hard to explain to people why their council tax is going up while their waste service is being cut. It is hard to explain to the public why asylum seekers are being placed in hotels for years on end at the taxpayers' expense....the best way to restore trust is through the contributory principle. If you pay in, you should be able to see what you get out."" Labour MP Clive Lewis, on the party's left, doesn't underestimate the scale of the challenge. One of his school friends took part in the recent Unite the Kingdom march in central London . Lewis hadn't thought he'd be part of it – he had black family members and is, says Lewis, ""a great guy"" - but his friend had texted to say he felt he was being listened to. Lewis says he has seen a ""vehemence and anger"" amongst a section of the electorate who feel let down - and for Keir Starmer to be believed when he calls out Farage, he needs to be trusted. He says he believes seeing off Farage is a much bigger task than making a speech, and the prime minister has to do nothing less than change the political culture in the government and in the country. Adam Langleben of the Progressive Britain think tank also believes progressive parties need to be more ""humble"" – whether in victory or defeat. ""We have an avoidable habit of not listening enough to the electorate,"" he says. Tackling a pessimistic public mood also requires more than policies. The prime minister is a political leader who appears to know the value of symbols. Soon after winning his party's leadership in 2020, he branded Labour literature with the union flag, which was also never far from the backdrop of his TV news clips. Initially it was to help define him against his predecessor, Jeremy Corbyn. The message was: Sir Keir would be unambiguously pro-Nato, pro nuclear deterrent, pro strong defence - proud of the flag. Safe to vote for. But those who converged in central London on the Unite the Kingdom march to hear Tommy Robinson weren't exactly waving their flags to symbolise support for Labour. It has again become a contested symbol. The prime minister is expected to say he wants to reclaim the flag. It's a problem that previous Labour leaders have grappled with - and the current one can perhaps learn from. When Neil Kinnock was the Labour opposition leader in the 1980s, he did not want to cede the mantle of patriotism to the Conservatives, so he sought to define patriotism in line with his own beliefs, and he placed the union jack (and the flags of the UK's constituent nations) on party literature to reclaim it, he said, from the far-right party, the BNP. In the 2000s, the governments of Tony Blair and Gordon Brown sought to claim 'Britishness' for themselves. But Keir Starmer faces a tougher political landscape now. According to recent polling from pollster Lord Ashcroft , the public can't agree on why union and English flags have been appearing on lampposts, and whether or not this is a good thing. Labour, Lib Dem and Green voters tend to think they signal hostility to immigrants; while right of centre voters believe they are signs of frustration with immigration. Overall, 39% of respondents supported the appearance of the flags while 28% disapproved - but about a quarter of voters surveyed had mixed feelings. Despite obvious divisions, Adam Langleben believes it is possible to create a ""progressive patriotism"", taking a leaf from the maiden speech of the murdered MP Jo Cox , which celebrated diversity but recognised that ""we have far more in common than that which divides us"". Reform UK have been clear what they are against.

The department said ""officials are working at pace with [the minister] to determine how we will move forward with a War Memorial"". The trust took this as welcome confirmation that the new Labour government did intend to honour the previous government's commitment to make a grant available to help fund a Muslim war memorial, even if it was not confirmation the memorial would definitely go ahead. Over the following months Sir William continued to press for a decision and whether the Â£1m was still available. In November 2024, the department said that it remained ""committed to providing funding of up to Â£1m"", and officials were working on taking the matter forward. The following month, an exercise to gather information about suppliers was launched, which the trust responded to. But by May this year, nothing had happened. Sir William emailed again to ask about progress, but the response again was that no decision had yet been made. Sir William now says: ""Silence reigns."" ""The issue is not that the government is obliged to support the trust's memorial,"" Sir William says. ""It is when we can expect a decision whether it will provide any financial support and, if so, how much and on what terms. On that hangs how we approach others to give to the project.""

93bec1d5998d,Burnham's provocative challenge to Starmer shows he is serious,,"Location: party conference. A fairly new prime minister is struggling for popularity with his party and the country at large, against a backdrop of grim economic choices. A popular, plain-speaking mayor enters the week talked up as a future leader  — and is doing little to dampen that speculation himself. The year is 2012, the prime minister is David Cameron and the mayor is Boris Johnson. But it could just as well be 2025, Sir Keir Starmer and Andy Burnham. Sometimes politicians of all parties flirt with the possibility of one day becoming leader in suggestive, coy, almost deniable ways. This is not an example of that. Burnham is being more overt. To the Telegraph, the Greater Manchester mayor gave a straight answer to a straight question: yes, he had been contacted by Labour MPs ""throughout the summer"" about the prospect of him returning to Westminster, where he was an MP for 16 years, to lead Labour and replace Starmer as prime minister. Burnham said this was ""more a decision for those people than it is for me"". He repeated that line in an interview with BBC Manchester. Well, up to a point. Burnham is not an MP. He would have to decide to become one if he wants to be Labour leader and prime minister. Labour's rule book dictates that the party leader must be an MP, so when the party is in government that means the prime minister must also be an MP, meaning they have to be elected to Parliament rather than made a member of the Lords. This means that his path to Downing Street is extremely complicated. First, a Labour MP would need to resign their seat so there is a by-election - unless a contest happened to arise through an MP dying or similar. Because of Burnham's distinctive regional pitch, the constituency would surely have to be in Greater Manchester or at least the north-west of England. Two Manchester Labour MPs, Andrew Gwynne and Graham Stringer, have already ruled out standing down for Burnham. Then, Burnham would have to be selected as Labour's candidate. This would require the approval of Labour's national executive committee, which for most purposes is controlled by allies of Starmer, although at least some of those would probably support Burnham's return to Westminster. Then, he would have to win the by-election in a difficult national political environment for the Labour Party. And then, finally, Burnham would have to secure the backing of 80 Labour MPs to challenge Starmer  - at which point presumably other candidates would enter the fray. There are a lot of difficulties along that path. Still, it is clearly a path that he is willing, at the very least, to publicly entertain. The mere existence of the Telegraph interview, alongside a long profile in the New Statesman, the bible of left-liberals, is pretty provocative. Burnham knew that he would be asked questions about his national ambitions, and that they would create a stir in the days before a crucial party conference for Starmer. Perhaps most notable, though, is that Burnham used both interviews to spell out a policy prospectus: higher council tax on expensive homes, borrowing to invest in council housing, cutting income tax for lower earners and increasing it for higher earners. In the New Statesman, he said: ""We've got to get beyond this thing of being in hock to the bond markets"". That is a direct challenge not just to Starmer but to Chancellor Rachel Reeves and her view  - her supporters and plenty of experts would say the economic reality  - that the government cannot borrow much more money. It is an argument that quite a few Labour MPs make, mostly in private: that this government has allowed itself to become too constrained by Treasury orthodoxy. To have Burnham joining that argument publicly, whether his leadership challenge is plausible or not, is unwelcome for Starmer and Reeves. In government, there is frustration and no small amount of bafflement that Burnham has decided to make these interventions now. One senior source said he was: ""A Boris-sized ego, but without the strategic thought."" Speaking from the main stage of Conservative conference back in 2012 (an honour not being afforded to Burnham at Labour's conference next week), Boris Johnson ended up rallying the members behind David Cameron. It took him seven years to get to No 10. It's hard to see the Starmer and Burnham story taking quite so long to play out, whatever the ultimate conclusion.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx275r1l3xpo,politics,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/da0e/live/172696c0-99e9-11f0-ab25-c9c4c516f15a.jpg,2025-09-25T09:50:48.015000+00:00,238925805f5ba54834c3088b16ab6682e44c54db
f12bce52aabf,How long can the UK afford the pension triple lock?,,"How long can the UK afford the pension triple lock? Dharshini David Deputy economics editor and Raphael Sheridan Economics reporter BBC Glenys is concerned about people whose only income is the basic state pension At a weekly ballet class in Wokingham, dancers glide elegantly through an intricate series of poses, making it look easy despite ranging in age from 50 to over 80. Figures released on Tuesday, suggesting retirees will likely benefit from a 4.7% increase in the state pension from next April , will add a spring to those dancers' steps. Yet concerns remain. Glenys worries about those whose only income is the basic state pension. ""I do feel sorry for people that are struggling, if it's food or heat,"" she says. Meanwhile, former architect Mary says her children's generation are having to strive harder and for longer to afford to start a family or buy a home. ""My daughter's about to give birth, and she's beginning to contribute to a pension. But what it's going to be like for the new grandchild, I've no idea."" Glenys and Mary's reflections show not only the success of the triple lock system used to increase pensions but also raises questions around its fairness and its sustainability. The triple lock formula says that the state pension will rise in spring by the greater of 2.5%, the previous September's inflation rate, or the increase in average earnings registered over the previous summer. Because the earnings figure published on Tuesday morning is almost certain to be the highest of those three, it is likely the state pension will go up by 4.7% in April. The measure has helped to cut the number of pensioners living in poverty, but according to the minister who launched it, Sir Steve Webb, it's not job done yet. The UK's state pension is less generous than the average in rich countries, meaning we are more reliant on private savings. And the nature of the cost of living crisis of the past few years, centred on the staples like food and energy, has left those reliant on the state pension particularly stretched. It could get worse for some pensioners. The triple lock means the new state pension - for those who reached pension age after April 2016 - is creeping closer to the £12,570 threshold at which tax becomes payable. That threshold is set to be frozen until 2028, meaning people like former hairdresser Linda will soon likely end up paying income tax on their pension under current plans. ""You're given it in one hand and it's taken away in the other, so that's not a lot of good,"" she says. ""If they could raise the tax threshold, it would make a huge difference."" The state pension faces other issues. We are living longer and having fewer children, so the bill is booming and it is being footed by a falling share of the population. Already, funding the state pension accounted for almost £140bn in the last financial year, making it the second biggest claim on the public purse after health spending. And the amount spent is vulnerable to the kind of extremes in inflation we've seen in recent years, meaning it now costs about three times as much as its architects originally reckoned. Linda worries about having to pay tax on her state pension in the future Future sums threaten to be eyewatering. The government's own independent forecaster says that by 2070 the amount needed to fund the state pension will be equivalent to 7.7% of GDP - 50% higher than right now. That is quite an ask of taxpayers when other claims on the public purse are also projected to soar, in particular healthcare spending - largely for the same group of older Brits. As the costs mount, many economists say the triple lock might disappear. Keeping it going means shifting an increasing amount of resources from younger generations, workers and business owners, to older ones. The government has committed to keeping it in place for the rest of the parliament, but Pensions Minister Torsten Bell admitted in a previous role - as chief executive of the Resolution Foundation, a think tank that focuses on the plight of the lower paid - that the triple lock is a ""messy tool"". So what should replace it? In his previous job, Bell touted a system of increases that was shielded from spikes in inflation. Webb, who acknowledges the triple lock can't continue ""infinitely"", has mentioned a system of getting the pension to a certain proportion of average earnings – and then maintaining that. Others have floated the idea of linking it to inflation or earnings increases. The question is whether politicians would do any of this. The scrutiny in the run-up to the last election on the triple lock, and the row over the winter fuel payment , underscores what a sensitive topic pensioners' finances are with voters. That is not just the case with current retirees. Shortly after speaking to Linda, Glenys and Mary, we visited a board game night in Reading where players were mainly in their 20s and 30s. They pointed out that pensioners can still find it a struggle to afford the basics and, crucially, they themselves know that this is the scheme that they will have to rely on in some form. Small wonder that most politicians shy away from the issue where they can. There is an alternative, but not an enticing one. The Institute for Fiscal Studies reckons that we'd have to work until 74 to keep a lid on state pension spending. No-one said getting older was easy.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c9wdgk7ggezo,politics,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/c07a/live/b2ce65e0-92cc-11f0-a72d-3fad567a173a.jpg,2025-09-16T09:04:55.401000+00:00,86c0560311218126e96b2d16bd5d6c033b347fab
777652698006,The blossoming relationship between Trump and Swinney,,"The blossoming relationship between Trump and Swinney Glenn Campbell Scotland political editor The White House John Swinney lobbied Donald Trump at a meeting in the White House John Swinney and Donald Trump remain at odds on a whole range of issues - but something has fundamentally changed in their relationship. On Wednesday, Scotland's first minister will don his sharpest evening wear to attend a State banquet at Windsor Castle in honour of the US president. Six months ago there seemed little chance that the SNP leader would have anything to do with President Trump's second state visit to the UK. In early March, Swinney said it was ""unthinkable"" the trip should go ahead following the Oval Office ambush of Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky. Trump has since lifted a pause on the US supply of weapons to Ukraine but his commitment to its defence against Russia remains in question. Swinney also criticised the Trump plan to take over Gaza and develop the coastline into a Riviera of the Middle East style resort, saying it would amount to ""ethnic cleansing"". But now he is set to join Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer and Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch at the Windsor banquet. Why has John Swinney's approach changed? The event has been boycotted by Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey in protest over US policy on Gaza, and Scottish Greens co-leader Ross Greer has urged Swinney to join the boycott. Swinney will be the only devolved first minister to attend. The Northern Ireland executive is being represented by DUP deputy first minister Emma Little-Pengelly. The Labour first minister of Wales, Eluned Morgan, has politely declined the King's invitation in order to lead tributes to a deceased political colleague in Cardiff. Reform UK's Nigel Farage has not been invited. So what has changed to alter John Swinney's approach? That was a question I put to him at a news conference in Edinburgh last week and his answer was fairly opaque. ""We've just got to get on with the world as we see it and as it is in front of us,"" he said. He was just off a plane from the United States, where he had been granted extraordinary access to the Oval Office to make the case directly to President Trump for the reduction or removal of US import tariffs or taxes on Scotch whisky. Scottish government Swinney is arguing for a reduction or removal of US import tariffs on whisky This is a pragmatic first minister who has clearly decided to engage with the US president where he sees an opportunity to influence his thinking, especially if it could benefit the Scottish economy. That does not prevent him from speaking up on issues of concern like Ukraine and Gaza, although he may need to be more diplomatic in how he makes those interventions. That is essentially the approach that Sir Keir Starmer has taken and he has managed to secure lower tariffs for UK produce entering the US market than those faced by other countries, including EU member states. UK negotiators have been working ahead of the state visit to secure further concessions on trade and Swinney has seized the opportunity to contribute to that effort on behalf of Scotch whisky. But given that trade is a UK government responsibility, not one for the Scottish government, how has he managed to get to the heart of the action? Reuters Trump opened his new golf course in Aberdeenshire during his visit to Scotland Donald Trump had a huge fallout with Alex Salmond when he was first minister over the Scottish government's support for offshore wind. The pivotal moment in changing relations with the Trumps was a meeting between John Swinney and President Trump's son Eric on Thursday 13 March. I remember it because it was kept secret in advance and I bumped into the first minister rushing down a back staircase to leave Holyrood after question time that day. He made no reference to where he was going, why he was in a hurry or why he was avoiding the usual route that would take him past a clutch of news reporters hoping to catch a word. This meeting was arranged at the request of the Trump Organisation, which has two golf resorts in Scotland at Turnberry in Ayrshire and Balmedie in Aberdeenshire. Both sides described it as a business discussion and insisted that politics were not mentioned, although the lines between those two spheres have become increasingly blurred since President Trump returned to office. Building a new relationship It seems the two most important words spoken at Eric Trump's meeting with the first minister at his official residence in Edinburgh were ""thank you"". Swinney thanked the Trump family for their investment in Scotland and the Trump team were taken aback because they said no-one in the Scottish government had previously bothered to say these words. A few months before, Eric Trump had called John Swinney ""nasty"" for endorsing Kamala Harris in the US presidential election campaign. It seemed this could now be put aside and a new relationship built. It may be worth noting that when the Trumps first came to Scotland seeking to build on the protected sand dunes of the Menie estate in Aberdeenshire, it was John Swinney who granted them planning permission, overturning local objections. He had been their ally in the past and perhaps he could be again. Reuters Keir Starmer had dinner with Donald Trump during his visit to Scotland this summer There is no suggestion that the Trump business has asked for anything specific from the Scottish government. However, it is a matter of record that Scottish ministers awarded public funds to support a golf tournament to be played at Trump International, as the Aberdeenshire business is officially known. That was announced in time for Donald Trump's visit to his Scottish golf resorts in July, which included a dinner with both the prime minister and the first minister in Aberdeenshire. Swinney had a breakfast meeting with the president the following morning before attending the opening of a new Trump golf course at which Donald Trump praised him as a ""terrific guy"". It was during this visit that Swinney said he took the opportunity to raise concerns about the impact of US tariffs on the whisky industry. He had heard the president say on arrival in Scotland that he did not realise that whisky was an issue, even though the UK government insists it was among the items on their trade agenda. Scottish government Swinney had a 50-minute conversation with Trump on his visit to Washington Swinney suspected steel and pharmaceuticals were higher on the UK's priority list and made a point of pressing the case for whisky with the president. He may then have been a little disappointed when Trump played down the extent of their discussion when he spoke to reporters aboard Air Force One on the flight back to America. But that was not to be the end of their conversation on whisky. The Scottish government followed up through US diplomats and Swinney decided to fly to Washington to lobby further, accepting an invitation to make his case directly to President Trump in the White House. He had a 50-minute conversation with the most powerful political leader in the western world. None of his predecessors as first minister have been afforded that amount of face time. Labour's Henry McLeish is the only previous holder of the office to have been granted a courtesy call to the Oval Office. This special access was supported by the then UK ambassador in Washington, Lord Peter Mandelson, before the extent of his past friendship with Jeffrey Epstein brought him down. Relaxing whisky tariffs 'a win-win' deal While Trump's Scottish heritage may have helped get Swinney in the door, the first minister said he did not trade on sentiment but instead presented a potential ""win-win"" business deal to Donald Trump. The proposal is that by relaxing tariffs on Scotch whisky he would not only ease a burden on Scotland's national drink but also boost demand in Scotland for used bourbon casks from Kentucky. A lot of whisky is matured in these second hand barrels and US distillers are working with the Scotch Whisky Association to appeal for a special trading arrangement - zero tariffs on Scotch entering the US and none on bourbon or used casks coming into the UK. Swinney's lobbying on this issue could be a political win-win for him too. If Trump agrees a deal, Swinney will be able to claim a share of the credit. If that does not happen, Swinney will argue that the UK government failed to bring home a deal that he set up. If there is blowback from within the SNP over his efforts to woo Trump that is not yet apparent. One party insider who is very cautious about Trump described Swinney as having played an ""absolute blinder"". One former Conservative adviser told me Swinney's approach was ""smart politics"". PA Media Scottish Secretary Douglas Alexander said whisky was very high up the UK's list of priorities What seems remarkable to me is that the first minister was able to develop this strategy under the noses of UK Labour ministers without any obvious challenge. They enabled him to run rings round them. The new UK Business Secretary Peter Kyle was in Washington talking tariffs the day before John Swinney, yet his department struggled to produce a statement for days. Perhaps the administration was distracted by the reshuffle following the resignation of Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner or the emerging crisis surrounding Lord Mandelson. Eventually, the new Scottish Secretary Douglas Alexander took to the airwaves to insist that the UK government had been ""thinking, working, talking and negotiating about whisky for many weeks and months"". He argued that whisky was ""very high"" up the list of priorities for the UK as it seeks further trade concessions from the US and warned Swinney against ""playing politics"". There is no certainty that whisky will get a special deal or that any announcement will come during Trump's state visit - but the industry has sensed in recent weeks that a better deal for them could be ""deliverable"". They would raise a glass to that if it happens and leave the politicians to squabble over who fought Scotch's corner the hardest.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3e75d7g49no,politics,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/cb2b/live/071a8960-92de-11f0-950e-eb051178bae0.jpg,2025-09-17T06:07:24.876000+00:00,f677f380a7d8d4e0650cff237db5d2ee5a2cc0e5
f1fbeaddf06c,Scotland gives Trump three things he likes - and one thing he doesn't,,"Scotland gives Trump three things he likes - and one thing he doesn't Sarah Smith North America editor in Scotland Getty Images A list of Donald Trump's favourite things would be very unlikely to include raindrops on roses and whiskers on kittens (as Julie Andrews famously sang in The Sound of Music). Instead, the president's list would surely have on it playing golf, a way to brazenly promote his commercial interests and, thirdly, trade deals that generate billions of dollars for the United States. No wonder he looks so pleased with himself - his working holiday in Scotland has delivered on all three of these passions. On what was billed as a ""private visit"" he got a lot of work done. He is taking home with him a trade deal with the EU which is not only the largest in history, it is also extremely favourable to the US. The EU will spend hundreds of billions of dollars buying American energy and military equipment as well as investing billions more in the US economy. In return European goods will be subject to a 15% tariff when they are exported to the US rather than the 30% Trump had threatened. The deal is an important achievement for Trump to be able to boast about, even if he has failed to conclude the ""90 deals in 90 days"" he had promised. He also seemed to relish hosting Sir Keir and Lady Starmer at his Turnberry golf resort on Monday. It was a peculiar spectacle, the British prime minister being welcomed as guest in his own country. But the PM was prepared to overlook the protocol when he was being treated to an unusual and valuable amount of face time with the US president. Trump is, after all, a man whose foreign policy is abnormally influenced by his personal relations with other world leaders. Their talks were dominated by the crisis in Gaza. Starmer appeared to make some headway as he pressed Trump to use his influence to get more food into the Palestinian territory. Getty Images Starmer and wife Victoria were hosted by Trump at Turnberry Trump said afterwards that the US would work with the UK and other European partners to set up food centres, adding that he will tell Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu to ensure that food gets to people who need it. ""I want to make sure they get the food, every ounce of food."" He also seemed to give the green light to Starmer to officially recognise the state of Palestine even though that is not something the US will do. ""I'm not going to take a position, I don't mind him taking a position,"" he said. Trump also made a significant change to his position on the conflict in Ukraine. He revealed that he is now giving Russian President Vladimir Putin only 10-12 days to agree to a ceasefire, not the 50 days he had previously given him. ""There's is no reason in waiting… I want to be generous but we just don't see any progress being made."" All of these major announcements were made during an exceptionally long, wide-ranging and free-wheeling press conference, during which the US president appeared extremely relaxed. He was prepared to talk at length about anything from wind power to immigration, including his views on King Charles and the mayor of London, Sadiq Khan. Watch: Trump says he turned down an invitation to Epstein's island There was one issue he could not escape, much as he perhaps wanted to. He was inevitably asked about Jeffrey Epstein, as the long running controversy about why he is refusing to release all the files held by the US government on the deceased sex offender followed him across the Atlantic. A van displaying an old photograph of Trump at a party with Epstein was driving around Aberdeenshire to make sure the president could not escape the furore. He told us for the first time why he fell out with the disgraced financier many years ago, saying that Epstein had poached staff from Trump's Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida and he refused to talk to him after that. And he denied ever having sent a lewd drawing to Epstein (as reported by the Wall St Journal), claiming that he only ever draws very basic pictures of buildings. The intrusion of the Epstein scandal into Trump's Scottish trip was a reminder of what inevitably awaits him on his return to Washington but it did not seem to dent his buoyant mood. A few anti-Trump protests were staged. But they were largely kept away from the president himself and were remarkably muted compared with previous visits. The most determined demonstrators were Trump fans who turned out to greet him as he landed in Prestwick and at both golf resorts, holding large signs welcoming him to Scotland. The president also took every opportunity to use this trip to proudly promote his two Scottish golf resorts. He hosted the press conferences with Starmer and Ursula von der Leyen, head of the EU's executive, in the newly renovated ballroom at Turnberry, boasting of the opulent new ceiling and brand new windows at the same time as discussing famine in Gaza. Getty Images Starmer and Trump arrive by helicopter at Trump MacLeod House Arriving in Aberdeenshire with Starmer on board his Marine One helicopter, he took a couple of laps to show off the new golf course before landing. After talks with John Swinney on Tuesday morning, he had the Scottish first minister attend the official opening of the Trump International Golf Links in the village of Balmedie, along with several VIPs and a phalanx of TV cameras. It is exceptionally unusual for a US president to so nakedly use his office to promote his own commercial interests but it is something Donald Trump clearly revels in doing. Almost as much as he enjoys playing golf. Which he managed to do on almost every day of this trip.

8ee7f100cb83,Starmer had to show his critics he can take on Farage,,"Starmer had to show his critics he can take on Farage Chris Mason Political editor Starmer questions if Reform wants to serve ""our beautiful, tolerant, diverse country"" Sir Keir Starmer was last year's big winner at the general election. This year saw the prime minister sharpening his argument against Nigel Farage and - by extension - against those within his own party, from the cabinet down, who fret he's not the best frontman for the fight that beckons with Reform UK. There is a defiance and steeliness to the prime minister; with this performance, he reminded his internal critics just who it was who won that whopping majority in the election 15 months ago. The year gone by has been a relentless grind – not least the last few weeks, after losing the former deputy PM Angela Rayner and US ambassador Peter Mandelson - and in his speech, the prime minister wanted to remind the audience of the achievements of the past months. His critics within the Labour party remind him, relentlessly, that Labour's politics must be politically more aggressive, front-footed and pointed in order to defeat a communicator of Nigel Farage's ability. This speech was the prime minister's response. It taught us little new about Sir Keir's political creed, but persistently painted the dividing line he wants: Reform versus everyone else. And he says he's the figurehead for that fightback. Farage has claimed his migration policy being labelled ""racist"" by the prime minister had put his staff at risk; it left him ""more determined than ever"", he said. Was Sir Keir Starmer's speech up to the challenge? Is this the point where the pace quickens? The prime minister is now approaching a bleak-looking Budget and a grim set of local elections, and elections in Wales and Scotland, next May. And even his most loyal allies accept those elections could determine if he's still delivering a conference speech to the assembled party as prime minister this time next year.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cpw1jwdlz7lo,politics,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/6f98/live/049f4ce0-9e26-11f0-b741-177e3e2c2fc7.jpg,2025-09-30T17:52:33.029000+00:00,0c0d7501f6218fa32b8356e644d663a4634db3f8
caad761735e3,Labour grapples with threat from Reform UK at party conference,,"It is just 14 months since the general election. Not yet 500 days. Labour has a working majority of 161. But here on the banks of the Mersey, it really doesn't feel like that. I am reminded of Conservative conferences of old, where a circus would accompany Boris Johnson from the railway station to each and every event he attended, in the years when it was transparently clear he was rather keen on becoming prime minister. Swop a former mayor of London and subsequent prime minister for the current mayor of Greater Manchester and aspiring prime minister Andy Burnham, and you have a sense of the vibe here. There is no shortage of acidic views about what is seen as the rather thrusting nature of Burnham's ambition, or near hagiographic accounts of his governance of Greater Manchester as its mayor – with the clear implication he should stay there. But there is one big reason why all this is happening, so early in this parliament: it is symptomatic of a party wrestling publicly and privately with how it confronts Reform UK. There is broad and deep reflection from plenty here – from the cabinet to councillors – that the pitch right now from Labour to the country isn't good enough. This is why we are seeing a sharpening in the language and the policies being presented now. No fewer than 10 cabinet ministers are addressing this conference from the main stage on Monday. The centrepiece address will be from Chancellor Rachel Reeves, who will argue that Reform presents a threat to the British economy with the potential, she will argue, for more borrowing and rising barriers to international trade. But perhaps more striking is the speech from the new Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood. She has been dubbed 'the Terminator' by the tabloids. She gives every impression she might regard that nickname as a bit wishy-washy, a bit namby-pamby. ""You won't always like what I'll do,"" she will say, addressing Labour activists in front of her directly. In other words, her instincts and approach in the Home Office might make some within the party squeamish. But she sees it as absolutely essential – and the clue is in the candid observations she has already shared here at an event on the conference fringe. ""We can reclaim the mantle that was once ours and can be again: we will be the party of the working class,"" she said – an acknowledgement that, right now at least, they are not. It is a reflection, in a sentence, of how this party perceives its predicament and what it is trying to do about it.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cr701vn0rjmo,politics,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/42a2/live/42a6d600-9d06-11f0-a8fe-677b0b0b2d56.jpg,2025-09-29T08:06:22.261000+00:00,9ca067e52da09bc744ea75a5b6b3e22cac66b74d
9e3ec1b479d7,Chris Mason: Starmer unflinching as he seeks to take on Reform,,"Chris Mason: Starmer unflinching as he seeks to take on Reform Chris Mason Political editor EPA First week by week, and now day by day, the prime minister is stepping up the way he describes the political battle between Labour and Reform UK. Sir Keir Starmer tells the Guardian this weekend: ""History will not forgive us if we do not use every ounce of our energy to fight Reform. There is an enemy. There is a project which is detrimental to our country. It actually goes against the grain of our history. It's right there in plain sight in front of us. We have to win this battle."" Expect more in the coming days at the Labour Party Conference in Liverpool, including in the prime minister's speech on Tuesday. He heads to the north west of England after a day in the company of fellow left-wing leaders at a conference in London. I was standing at the back of Methodist Central Hall in Westminster listening to a quartet of prime ministers. Sir Keir was joined by his opposite numbers from Canada, Australia and Iceland. And here's the thing: while they are all winners, they had the demeanour of those with pensive worry. The rise of Reform here in the UK is far from unique. There was a confessional vibe at times to the conversation, borne of a fear the left can exude a piety and loftiness off-putting to many. Sir Keir's take on this was that Labour took far too long to recognise the deep-seated concerns from many about illegal immigration. It was an observation some within Labour are weary of hearing about again, recalling the fuss a decade ago when Labour had mugs printed with the promise of ""controls on immigration"". Others say Labour cannot highlight its instinct to be tough too much, given the instinct of many, fairly or otherwise, is to assume they might be the opposite. Amid the noise of this debate comes the plan for digital ID . After two decades of rapid digitalisation, from the smartphone's invention to its near ubiquity, the prime minister reckons the centre of gravity around the whole issue of state-mandated ID - and our collective willingness to embrace it - has shifted. Twenty years ago, Tony Blair was making the case for ID cards. The ""card"" bit of the idea feels rather vintage, but the ID bit is back as an idea. It is an idea still lacking in key detail, but one Sir Keir wants to enthusiastically embrace. He told me a few weeks ago, as he began to publicly toy with it, that plenty of us are now much more used to handing bits of personal data to all sorts of institutions and companies we deal with online. So, the logic goes, plenty will be comfortable doing the same thing with the government. Let's see. What is undoubtedly the case is that there is, again, noisy opposition to the idea. A petition on Parliament's website has reached well over a million signatures. Only a handful have cleared that threshold in the last decade. The prime minister will hope a quieter majority are won over by the idea – and he already has his political dividing line with Reform. And with the Conservatives, Liberal Democrats and Scottish National Party, as it happens. His challenge, against the toughest of backdrops - economic, political and international - is to prove he can deliver incremental, or better, improvements for voters, and convince enough that the embrace of Reform would be a big mistake. Sir Keir is now unflinching and explicit, talking of what he calls the ""open fight"" he wants with Reform - a ""battle for the soul of this country"". On that characterisation of the tussle ahead, at least, Reform agree that is precisely what it amounts to.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvg41lljnryo,politics,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/a899/live/280e58d0-9b3b-11f0-928c-71dbb8619e94.jpg,2025-09-27T00:23:17.959000+00:00,af0e940484d184320161b29f3224351402019d5d
95cf05fdea01,Chris Mason: Starmer's irritation with Burnham shows as he seeks to tackle critics,,"Chris Mason: Starmer's irritation with Burnham shows as he seeks to tackle critics Chris Mason Political editor Getty Images The prime minister will address a conference of centre-left leaders from around the world on Friday and argue it is time to ""look ourselves in the mirror and recognise where we've allowed our parties to shy away from people's concerns."" A key theme of the Global Progressive Action Conference is about how the Labour Party and its sister outfits around the world take on Reform UK and their equivalents. ""This is the defining political choice of our times: a politics of predatory grievance, preying on the problems of working people… against the politics of patriotic renewal,"" Sir Keir Starmer will claim. And it is this challenge that unites the two big things in politics in the last 48 hours. First there was the blizzard of headlines about the Mayor of Greater Manchester, Andy Burnham. Then, conveniently timed, the blizzard of headlines yesterday afternoon about the government's plans for compulsory digital ID. This, yes, is the daily din of Westminster, but there is a signal amid the noise. Personnel, policy and ambitions are all in the mix here, three of the staples of politics, but they are also both a symptom of the same thing: a party and a movement wrestling with how to confront what senior figures agree is a generational challenge – the rise of Reform UK. This, for so many Labour folk, is not merely the traditional political tussle with the party's oldest adversary, the Conservatives. Instead, it is an insurgency which utterly horrifies so many of them. It is Reform's recent rise - and the durability of its support, up to now at least - that has fast forwarded the collywobbles in a vast parliamentary Labour Party so soon after a general election. Of all the criticisms of Sir Keir, there is one that has stuck, almost to the point of cliche, and is acknowledged as being fair within government and beyond. It is the persistent critique that there has long been a lack of definition about the government's direction. And it is into this perceived vacuum that Andy Burnham has stridden, again, to the intense irritation of Downing Street and plenty of Labour MPs. I know what Labour should stand for and I'd know how I'd communicate it is the underlying message from Manchester, with the implication the prime minister isn't doing either. Sir Keir may not strike you as the kind of bloke to be frequently demonstrably angry or irritated. But when a Labour prime minister compares a Labour colleague to former Conservative Prime Minister Liz Truss , you know just how narked he is by the whole thing. The prime minister and those around him have long privately rolled their eyes at Burnham's antics. But when Sir Keir invokes the memory of a prime minister associated with economic calamity and near immediate political oblivion – and, on top of that, suggests his economic prospectus could lead to the same outcomes – you know he isn't messing about. Watch: Andy Burnham on leadership speculation Incidentally, the scale of the backlash from Labour MPs to Burnham's interviews was quite the thing to witness. Burnham has his supporters in the Parliamentary Labour Party, but boy, plenty told us he should just shut up . And amid all this comes the crucial new detail about a plan the prime minister has talked up enthusiastically in recent weeks – digital ID. The new key point – it will be compulsory. Sir Keir will talk about the idea in his speech at a gathering also attended by Anthony Albanese, the prime minister of Australia, and Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney. He hopes it is a practical example of how he can give definition to his premiership, have what he hopes is a useful tool in tackling illegal working and therefore illegal immigration, and give himself a useful political dividing line with his opponents. Reform UK, the Liberal Democrats and the Scottish National Party are opposed to the plan. The Conservative position is more ambiguous. They see it for now at least as a ""desperate gimmick"" but do remain open to being persuaded it is a good idea. Is it something he can lean into as a defining idea of his time in office and help him address the predicament he and his party find themselves in? He has to hope so.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cly19zld70qo,politics,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/8b01/live/3c600720-9a9b-11f0-b741-177e3e2c2fc7.jpg,2025-09-26T05:36:16.399000+00:00,bd7c96f2347046f531ead32242171d296b037dab
573409afe4c8,Chris Mason: Punchy Lib Dems use Reform UK as call to action,,"Chris Mason: Punchy Lib Dems use Reform UK as call to action Chris Mason Political editor PA Media Sir Ed Davey's speech to close the Liberal Democrat conference was punchy. Here was a leader knowingly painting in primary colours and determined to be heard in our noisy politics. This was a gathering of a party willing to double down on being more aggressive in making its arguments - in particular, its focus on the Reform leader Nigel Farage. By my count there were at least 30 references to Farage – far, far more than to the prime minister or the Conservatives. Senior Liberal Democrats spot an opportunity right now: a willingness to take on Reform and Donald Trump in a way Labour and the Tories either can't or won't. And the party is using the Reform leader as a funding and recruiting sergeant. They hope the prospect of a Farage premiership will motivate their activists, in efforts and donations, in a way a prospective Labour or Conservative victory might not do. But the Lib Dems realise too that Reform's rise has a cost when it comes to a squeeze on the attention paid to Sir Ed Davey and his team, hence their noisy protests and allegations - repeated again by Sir Ed in his speech - about the relative coverage and scrutiny different parties receive from the BBC and others. The corporation, incidentally, said ""these continuing attacks on BBC journalism are completely groundless – it is simply false to say that we give any political party any less scrutiny than any other"". The Lib Dems also didn't remove a reference to the prospect of the UK's gun laws changing under a Reform government, despite Reform making it clear before the speech was delivered, but after the script had been shared with reporters, that they had no intention of changing the law. When I asked if it was irresponsible or scaremongering to suggest schools might have to ""teach our children what to do in case of a mass shooting,"" they argued it is about holding Nigel Farage to account for remarks he made 11 years ago. Reform accused him of ""spouting total madness"". I'd say the mood of the Liberal Democrats felt chipper, but business-like. This time last year, just after a stonkingly good general election result for them, their conference felt like a non-stop party. Not so now. The political landscape has changed and changed quickly. Ed Davey's pitch The Lib Dems are far from the only ones seeking to adjust and adjust quickly. Part of their strategy is to extend their appeal towards recent Conservative voters unattracted by both Reform and Kemi Badenoch's leadership of the Tories. Sir Ed Davey's pitch was both direct - ""my message to you is this: come and talk to us"" - and also packaged in the language of a former Conservative prime minister. The Lib Dem leader talked of ""male voice choirs and Hogmanay, county shows and school fairs, fish and chips, village greens and cricket pavilions"". It reminded me of Sir John Major's words more than three decades ago: ""Fifty years from now Britain will still be the country of long shadows on county grounds, warm beer, invincible green suburbs, dog lovers and pools fillers and - as George Orwell said - 'old maids bicycling to Holy Communion through the morning mist' - and if we get our way, Shakespeare still read even in school."" Both men, today and in 1993, are attempting to portray a pride in what they see as an understated patriotism and respect for traditions, a small c conservatism. The Liberal Democrats hope they can be seen to represent the clearest and most authentic big party antidote to Reform. And they are buoyed by internal polling suggesting more people are at least open to voting Lib Dem than for any other party right now. But their challenge is they face a new and noisy rival in Reform for the protest votes of those put off by both the Conservatives and Labour. They have grounds to hope and to worry in this increasingly competitive, noisy and fluid politics – and a determination not to be squeezed out of the conversation.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvg97gq8230o,politics,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/394f/live/cea11a60-98c1-11f0-94c0-d393b11c46d7.jpg,2025-09-23T21:30:31.954000+00:00,180161a7b42e067eabb404da16fc88c3c30a22be
6dda1cf1f678,Nick Robinson: How the simmering row over freedom of speech in the UK reached boiling point,,"Nick Robinson: How the simmering row over freedom of speech in the UK reached boiling point Nick Robinson BBC ""At what point did we become North Korea?"" That was the question Nigel Farage posed when asked by a US congressional committee about limitations on freedom of speech in the UK. He was condemning the ""awful authoritarian situation we have sunk into"", which he claimed had led to various arrests including that of Father Ted co-creator Graham Linehan over his views on challenging ""a trans-identified male"" in ""a female-only space"". When I heard the question, I confess I thought that the leader of Reform UK had gone over the top. Farage was comparing his country - my country - with a brutal dictatorship that murders, imprisons and tortures opponents. And he was doing it in front of an influential audience of American lawmakers. Lucy North/PA Wire 'I don't regret anything I've tweeted,' Graham Linehan said earlier this month When I interviewed his deputy, Richard Tice on Radio 4's Today, I asked him whether he really believed that UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer was the same as North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. Three times I asked the question. Three times Tice swerved it, suggesting Farage was simply using ""an analogy"". But Farage is not alone in questioning how far restrictions to freedom of speech have gone in the UK. Tensions around the limits of free speech are nothing new and since the advent of social media in the mid-2000s, the arguments have been simmering. Now, though, they're reaching a boiling point. BENJAMIN CREMEL/AFP via Getty Images Farage lambasted the 'awful authoritarian situation we have sunk into' During his recent visit, US Vice-President JD Vance said he did not want the UK to go down a ""very dark path"" of losing free speech. The US business magazine Forbes carried an editorial this month that took this argument further still. In it, editor-in-chief Steve Forbes condemned the UK's ""plunge into the kind of speech censorship usually associated with tin pot Third World dictatorships"". He argues that, in stark contrast to the United States - where free speech is protected by the first amendment to the constitution, ""the UK has, with increasing vigour, been curbing what one is allowed to say, all in the name of fighting racism, sexism, Islamophobia, transgenderism, climate-change denial and whatever else the woke extremists conjure up"". So, how exactly did we get to the point where the UK is being compared to a dictatorship and, given how inflamed the conversation has become, what - if anything - would it take to turn down the heat? Big tech dialled up the debate The case of Lucy Connolly has become a cause celebre to some in the UK and beyond. The former childminder from Northampton, who is married to a Conservative councillor, had posted an abhorrent message on X, calling for people to ""set fire"" to hotels housing asylum seekers following the murder of three young girls at a dance class in Southport in July 2024. It was viewed hundreds of thousands of times at a time when the threat of violence was very real. Police/PA Wire Lucy Connolly was jailed for 31 months after calling for hotels housing asylum seekers to be set on fire Connolly had pleaded guilty to inciting racial hatred by publishing and distributing ""threatening or abusive"" written material on X. And yet she was given the red carpet treatment at the Reform party conference, as ""Britain's favourite political prisoner"". The length of her prison sentence - 31 months although she only served 40% before she was released - was questioned by many, including people who were appalled by what she had written. It is just one case that highlights how much social media has changed the shape of the debate around free speech and made heroes and villains of ordinary people. And I use the word ""ordinary"" deliberately because views similar to Connolly's will have been expressed up and down the land by others who might well have said, as she now does, ""I was an idiot"". But while it's unlikely that any action would have been taken had she said what she did in a coffee shop or a bar, the fact she posted it on social media changed things. ROBERTO SCHMIDT/AFP via Getty Images Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg has changed the rules for Facebook and Instagram What's more, big tech firms have changed their approach in recent years. After billionaire businessman Elon Musk bought Twitter, which he re-named X, he changed content moderation, which he regards as ""a propaganda word for censorship"" - and he talks a lot about people spreading ""the woke mind virus"". Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg has also changed the rules governing Meta and Instagram. In the case of Connolly, her post was ""accelerated by the algorithm"" and spread far more widely, according to Lilian Edwards, an emeritus professor at Newcastle University. Dilemma around policing speech The arrest of Graham Linehan at Heathrow, too, raised further questions around policing freedom of speech - and put the way issues are handled under renewed scrutiny. Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police Sir Mark Rowley has voiced his own concerns. ""It's a nonsense to pretend that with all of the (online) content out there that enforcement is the answer to that,"" he has said. What these cases both illustrate is the lack of consensus about what can and should be policed online in the UK, and by who. And a lack of consensus too about how we can set apart the unpleasant, offensive, ugly and hateful things said online from those that are genuinely threatening or dangerous. PA Sir Mark Rowley: 'It's a nonsense to pretend that with all of the content out there that enforcement is the answer' In the UK, the Human Rights Act does give protection to free speech but as a ""qualified right"". This means that ""governments can restrict that right… provided that the response is proportionate - [or] 'necessary in a democratic society' is what people tend to say"", according to Lorna Woods, professor of internet law at the University of Essex. But some of the comments made at the protest in London earlier this month, billed by far-right, anti-Islam activist Tommy Robinson as a ""free speech rally,"" demonstrate that, despite other controversies, that right isn't that qualified. Like nailing jelly to the wall ""Violence is coming"" and ""you either fight back or die"", Musk told flag-waving protesters via video link. Along with his call for the overthrow of the government, some might argue that his words at the rally were an incitement to violence. But the UK's independent reviewer of terrorism legislation, the barrister Jonathan Hall KC, has said that Musk's words would not have broken the law. ""Politicians use martial language all the time, don't they?"" he told BBC Radio 4's Today. ""Metaphors such as fights and struggles are pretty normal. And he was talking about it contingently, wasn't he? He wasn't saying: 'Go out immediately.'"" Reuters Musk called moderation ""a propaganda word for censorship"" Yet the fact both men were able to address a huge crowd in London is perhaps evidence that there is rather more leeway for free speech in this country than those likening the UK to a ""tin pot dictatorship"" suggest. According to Essex University's Prof Lorna Woods, the lowest level of views that can be prosecuted in British criminal law are those deemed ""grossly offensive or of an indecent, obscene or menacing character"". These are concepts that few people without a law degree could easily define, let alone agree upon. It is the job of the police initially, but ultimately the courts, to try to nail that particular piece of jelly to the wall. Universal History Archive/Universal Images Group via Getty Images Former deputy PM Sir Nick Clegg says the the UK is ""out of whack"" with other countries on free speech The UK is ""out of whack"" with other countries, according to Sir Nick Clegg, the former deputy prime minister who later became right-hand man to Zuckerberg. He believes the UK needs to ""think long and hard"" about ""whether we've overdone it"" on policing speech. ""Surely part of the definition of being in a free society is people say ghastly things, offensive things, awful things, ugly things, and we don't sweep them under the carpet,"" he has said. Free speech versus 'me speech' What the British public want is another story. Earlier this month, in a survey by YouGov, 5,035 British adults were asked what was most important when it came to online behaviour: 28% said it was that people were able to express themselves freely but 61% prioritised keeping them safe from threats and abuse. ""People tend to prefer safety to free speech [online],"" argues Anthony Wells, a director at YouGov. What's more, there seems to be a generational divide. Mark Kerrison / Getty Images and SOPA Images / Getty Images In a new YouGov survey, 61% of Britons said keeping people safe online was more important than absolute free speech In my conversations with young people in their 20s and 30s - the age of my own children - I often hear the view that far from being an ideal to be strived for, free speech is the cause of much of the anger, division and fear they live with every day. In recent years a ""cancel culture"" has emerged in which those with ""unacceptable"" views can be hounded out of their jobs, no platformed as speakers or intimidated as students. Even back in 2021, a YouGov poll of Britons found that a majority of those surveyed - some 57% - had sometimes stopped themselves from expressing political or social views because of the fear of being judged or negative responses. For those who believe that free speech is under threat in the country, these figures can be used as evidence that decades of political correctness has had a chilling effect on people's ability to express their opinions. ""Our definitions of what constitutes hate speech, and I think a very broadened definition of what constitutes harm, is meaning that people feel like they are walking on eggshells and they're frightened - not just that they'll have the police around, but that they'll be cancelled if they say the wrong thing,"" the former Brexit Party MEP Baroness Claire Fox told the BBC's The World Tonight. But dig deeper and this debate, like so much else, is also about politics and the deepening and, increasingly, angry and violent divisions in our society. What can America teach us? Even with its constitutional protection for free speech, plenty in the UK question what basis Americans have to lecture Britain on free speech, given the arguments they are having back at home. The anger and division sparked by the assassination of the conservative firebrand Charlie Kirk in Utah this month ramped up the debate further on that side of the Atlantic over where the boundaries should lie between what is offensive, hateful and dangerous. Michael Le Brecht/Disney via Getty Images ABC has suspended talk-show host Jimmy Kimmel over comments about the killing of right-wing influencer Charlie Kirk Trump's Attorney General Pam Bondi appalled many conservatives when she declared that, ""There's free speech and then there's hate speech"". It seemed to take her into precisely the territory, which has caused so many problems here in the UK. President Trump himself has threatened to sue the New York Times for $15bn (£11bn) over what he calls defamation and libel, adding to the long list of media outlets he has taken to the courts over stories - the newspaper has called it ""intimidation tactics"" - and he celebrated the sacking of the late-night TV host Jimmy Kimmel as ""great news for America"". The US historian Tim Snyder, who is an outspoken public critic of the direction America is heading under Trump believes that free speech should be distinguished from what he calls ""me speech"". Win McNamee/Getty Images Trump has threatened to sue the New York Times for $15 billion ""Me speech is a common practice among rich and influential Americans,"" writes Mr Snyder. ""Practitioners of me speech use the phrase free speech quite a bit. ""But what they mean is free speech for themselves. They want a monopoly on it. ""They believe that they are right about everything, and so they should always have giant platforms, in real life or on social media. ""The people with whom they disagree, however, should be called out and intimidated in an organised way on social media, or subjected to algorithmic discrimination so that their voices are not heard."" As much about listening This issue is one I've felt strongly about for as long as I can remember. My grandparents knew first hand what it was to be persecuted for who you were and what you thought or said. They were German Jews who fled the Nazis for what then was the relative security of China and later had to flee the Communists there. As a child, I recall watching in reverential silence as each day, after lunch, my grandfather held a huge radio on his lap and turned the dial, skipping stations until he found the BBC World Service. There, he had learned, he would find news he could trust and speech which was free of political control. So important was this to him that he had risked hiding with his wife and daughter (my mother) in a cupboard in their home in Shanghai to listen to it on a banned shortwave radio. Nick says he finds it hard to accept comparisons between the UK and a dictatorship That is why I find any comparison between the UK and a dictatorship a little hard to swallow. What I learned as the grandchild of those who had fled not one but two murderous ideologies was that free speech was about listening as much as talking. What mattered above all else is being able to hear both sides of an argument and learn the facts behind them - without having that information controlled by governments, rich and powerful media owners, or anyone else.

796a2f6086cd,Trump's state visit is mired with potential pitfalls despite careful planning,,"Trump's state visit is mired with potential pitfalls despite careful planning James Landale Diplomatic correspondent BBC Listen to James read this article US President Donald Trump's state visit to the United Kingdom this week will be no stranger to controversy, just as his first was six years ago. Back then, in June 2019, as well as taking tea with the late Queen, the US President called London Mayor Sadiq Khan ""a stone-cold loser"", backed Boris Johnson in a Tory leadership race and suggested the NHS should be part of US-UK trade talks. All this was accompanied by a petition saying he should not receive a state visit in the UK, signed by more than one million people, as well as noisy protests involving thousands and a huge inflatable effigy that became known as the Trump Baby. This week's second state visit – unprecedented for a non-royal - will prove the first was no exception. Mandel Ngan/AFP via Getty Images Trump being invited for a second state visit is unprecedented for a non-royal (pictured above during his previous visit, with First Lady Melania, in 2019) There will again be protests and Lord Mandelson's sacking as UK ambassador to the US has already cast a diplomatic pall over proceedings. Planning for the visit - over Wednesday and Thursday - has gone on for months, but for all the careful preparation, the possibility that things could go wrong is still very real. And for many of those organising it, the Mandelson affair is only one of their worries. How Windsor became 'Trumpton' For those at the royal end of the show, the focus has been on logistics and security - and turning Windsor Castle into a ring of steel hard enough to satisfy even the most fastidious secret service agents. Such has been the huge American presence some locals have renamed Windsor ""Trumpton"", after the eponymous town in the 1970s children's TV show. Mark Kerrison/In Pictures via Getty Images Detailed planning for the visit has gone on for months, down to banquet menus, seating plans and wording of the King's seven-minute speech For Palace officials, attention to detail is all. One of the biggest problems has been finding a place to muster the Household Cavalry. It needs to be far enough from the helicopter landing zones to ensure the horses are not spooked by the noise, close enough to form the escort quickly that will accompany the Trumps' carriage procession through the grounds of Windsor Castle. There has also been much discussion between the Palace and Foreign Office over who sits where at the State Banquet in St George's Hall. ""The value of these things are not just the photo opportunities but also all the off-grid conversations,"" said one royal insider. ""A huge amount of attention goes into the seating plan for the banquet. So people with certain policy areas are sat next to one another."" Jonathan Brady - WPA Pool/Getty Images One challenge has been making sure that the helicopter landing zones are positioned to ensure the horses of the Mounted Household Cavalry (pictured) are not spooked by the noise Much thought, too, is devoted to the menu and the music which will involve ""lots of nods to his Scottish heritage"". King Charles III's seven-minute speech at the banquet has gone through many drafts, ensuring he pushes the right buttons without crossing political lines. Officials say they have been given no indication by their US counterparts of what Trump may say in his speech. 'Pressure to make this massive' So far, so logistical – but the key challenge for royal organisers has been finding a way of ensuring Trump feels he has been given a full state visit with all the trimmings. That is no easy task. The president is on the ground for less than 48 hours and will not visit Downing Street, address Parliament or even find time to play a round of golf. ""There has been a large amount of government pressure to make this massive and that's been the challenge,"" one courtier told me. Jeff Gilbert - WPA Pool/Getty Images President Trump (pictured on his first state visit to the UK) will return for a second state visit this Wednesday and Thursday The scale of the ceremonial at Windsor has been stepped up, with 1,300 troops and 120 horses involved - far more than those used when President Macron of France visited earlier this year. (It's a point that will no doubt be emphasised to the Americans in private.) For the ceremonial hoopla is the overwhelming focus of the White House in this visit; a chance for the President to be photographed with the King and Queen and the Prince and Princess of Wales, along with military parades and bands and the Red Arrows. One Whitehall source said: ""The focus is very much on the optics, the historic moment, the pomp. For Trump it's all about TV and this is great TV."" Another said: ""It's theatre. It's all show. It's not like we are going to do deep substance. We are sucking up to the most powerful guy in the world for good reason."" Peter Nicholls/Getty Images Members of the Guard of Honour rehearse the ceremonial welcome The Trumps: Warm and solicitous guests Lord McDonald, a former top civil servant in the Foreign Office, said the UK's strategic choice to afford the most powerful man in the world ""the fullest honour British protocol allows"" will be watched closely by the rest of the world. ""This state visit is not just a UK-US event,"" he said. ""It will be one of the biggest stories around the world. ""The rest of the world will be looking at London and Windsor, burnishing the UK's wider international standing."" Many officials are confident the visit will go smoothly, simply because all sides want it to succeed. They emphasise that Palace staff thought the Trumps were warm and solicitous guests in 2019, both keen not to put a foot wrong. Mandel Ngan/AFP via Getty Images President Trump and King Charles will both make speeches at a banquet during the state visit ""Trump can be quite funny in private,"" said one diplomat. ""He has got quite a neat turn of phrase that the King will appreciate."" For the UK government, the overwhelming aim is for Air Force One to take off on Thursday evening with Trump warmly disposed to Britain. Serious business behind the pageantry Beyond providing a day of royal pageantry, the government has business to conduct on Thursday when proceedings move to the prime minister's country residence at Chequers. Ministers hope to complete a deal to exclude UK steel and aluminium from US tariffs. There will be some new civil nuclear cooperation. The centrepiece is set to be the signing of a technology partnership, involving new investment in Britain and greater cooperation with Silicon Valley on artificial intelligence and quantum computing. This was Lord Mandelson's priority, something he described in his outgoing letter to embassy staff last week as ""my personal pride and joy"", that he claimed would ""help write the next chapter of the special relationship"". All these issues will be portrayed as big domestic ""wins"" to help promote the government's growth agenda. Carl Court - Pool/Getty Images Ministers hope to complete a deal to exclude UK steel and aluminium from US tariffs The visit will also provide Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer with a significant opportunity to bend the ear of the president just a week before the United Nations general assembly in New York, especially on Ukraine. Jeremy Hunt, who as Foreign Secretary was heavily involved in the last Trump state visit, said this was a key chance to shape the president's thinking. ""Trump appears to be on a journey away from Putin, towards recognising that he needs a way of standing with his European allies a bit better,"" Hunt said. ""What the government will really be wanting to do is continue that journey, looking for a deal to impose more sanctions on countries buying Russian oil."" Leon Neal/Getty Images Planning has heavily focused on security - and turning Windsor Castle into a ring of steel Sophia Gaston, senior research fellow at King's College London, said the state visit was an important chance for the UK to influence US policy at a crucial stage of the Trump administration, a window of opportunity between its disruptive first six months and next year when its focus may shift to domestic elections and strategic competition with China. ""We are moving into a new phase,"" she said. ""This state visit really does matter. It is about us securing a foothold as the primary symbolic and strategic ally of the United States."" The Mandelson question For all these potential gains, the risks are huge and the most obvious involves, of course, Lord Mandelson. The peer's dismissal as ambassador, after revelations of the scale of his friendship with Jeffrey Epstein following Epstein's conviction as a paedophile, means the press conference at Chequers on Thursday will not be dominated by questions about his future. Instead, the prime minister will likely be asked why he appointed the peer in the first place and why he took so long to sack him; what did he know and when? Carl Court/Getty Images The PM will likely be asked why he appointed Lord Mandelson and why he took so long to sack him Some diplomats wonder if Trump may voice an opinion about who should replace Lord Mandelson, potentially putting No 10 in an invidious position. But perhaps the most dangerous question for the Prime Minister may be why he thinks Lord Mandelson should be punished for his links to Epstein, but not the US President standing next to him. According to Whitehall sources, this was a point Lord Mandelson deployed as he fought to save his job. It was not an argument that found favour in No 10 and officials note Trump, unlike Lord Mandelson, cut ties with Epstein well before his conviction - but it is a question that will float above this week's royal and political ceremonial. Jim Watson/AFP via Getty Images Lord Mandelson, who has been sacked as UK ambassador to the US, pictured with Trump and Vance Diplomats I have spoken to insist that so far the White House has been sanguine - if not a little bemused - at Lord Mandelson's departure, saying it is the UK's business, and the president remains excited about the state visit. But there is a fear among some that if Trump were dragged into the controversy and embarrassed at the press conference, then that could sour his mood – and the visit. Profound differences in the UK and US The Mandelson affair is not the only potential challenge. As one distinguished former British ambassador told me: ""On values and policies, we have fundamental differences with the Trump administration – on Nato, Ukraine, Middle East and China. ""The differences are more profound than at any time since World War Two."" Perhaps the most acute difference that could overshadow the visit relates to the Middle East. Next week the UK is expected to formally recognise Palestinian statehood in an attempt to keep alive the idea of a so-called ""two state solution"". But the Americans are strongly opposed, as the Secretary of State, Marco Rubio, made clear on Friday, emphasising his commitment ""to fight anti-Israel actions including unilateral recognition of a Palestinian state that rewards Hamas terrorism"". Getty Images Protests took place in the UK during Trump's last state visit, and there was a huge inflatable effigy that became known as the Trump Baby There are also political risks for the prime minister. Underlying this state visit is an unspoken transaction: that it is worth giving Trump all those trimmings in order to help British interests, namely to reduce tariffs and foster investment partnerships. Yet Trump is unpopular in the UK. A YouGov poll in July found only 16% of Britons surveyed say they have a positive view of him. The government will have to explain to voters why it believes this state visit is a price worth paying to try to grow the British economy. The diplomatic game of cards Amid these potential pitfalls lies a deeper, but less discussed risk from this state visit. That is: in its diplomatic game of cards, has the government played its King too explicitly for political purposes? ""The government have the convening power of the King and they have used it in a very transactional way, for example the brandishing of the King's letter in the Oval Office,"" said one royal source. ""They realise the Palace can draw people in, in a way that you can't in Whitehall. Peter Summers/Getty Images There have only ever been three state visits by US presidents: President Bush in 2003; President Obama in 2011 and President Trump in 2019 ""The problem in using the personality of the monarch and the institution of the monarchy is there is a risk that you cross a line and you ask someone who has to remain studiously non-political to transact a political act on behalf of the government."" Official state visits by US presidents are rare. There have only ever been three: President Bush in 2003; President Obama in 2011 and Trump in 2019. All other visits were official or informal. So this week's does matter. But even if it passes off smoothly and gaffe-free questions may remain about its efficacy. ""This is very early in Trump's presidency,"" one diplomat said. ""Have we played this card too soon? What do we do for an encore?""

d85289a2b48f,"Starmer resets after Rayner row, but Labour turmoil is a gift for Reform",,"Starmer resets after Rayner row, but Labour turmoil is a gift for Reform Laura Kuenssberg Presenter, Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg BBC Welcome to the weird world of UK politics 2025. The TV presenter Jeremy Kyle announces to a huge crowd of Nigel Farage supporters at Reform UK's party conference that David Lammy is the new number two in government and they boo, panto-style. And there's a YouTube video of the (now former) deputy prime minister dancing in a tracksuit and chunky gold chain waving wads of cash that's been watched more than 1.5m times. These might both sound like parodies, but only the video of Angela Rayner rapping ""How Many Homes Can Rayner Buy"" was a joke. And what was planned as No 10's ""get back in charge week"" has been blown up by a row you couldn't make up – the housing secretary in trouble for not paying tens of thousands of pounds of tax on her expensive new house. Her exit pushed the button on a chunky shakeup of Sir Keir Starmer's team. The start of this political season has been wild. Arron Chown/ PA Both Rayner's team and No 10 felt she had to go In the end, Rayner's decision to go was clear cut. The official report into her behaviour said she'd tried to do the right thing, but not tried hard enough. So the rules had been broken. Her camp reckoned she had no option. No 10 agreed. There is frustration that the manner of her exit from government gave her critics what they wanted. But she knew she had no choice, and was devastated by her own mistake. It's acutely and specifically painful for Labour because Rayner had personally styled herself as something of a sleaze-buster. It was she who often led the charge against the succession of Conservatives who got into trouble over their own complicated financial arrangements, hurling accusations of arrogance and greed on a fairly regular basis. She was the shoutier end of Starmer's so called ""Mr Rules"" approach, a serious belief that government had to be washed clean of its tawdry image after multiple scandals and Boris Johnson's, ahem , flexible attitude to the normal rules. She portrayed herself as a loud and proud champion of ordinary people looking at the worst Westminster behaviour in disgust. Jane Barlow/ PA Rayner had styled herself as something of a sleaze-buster For Labour in general, it undermines again, their claim to be different to those who went before, to return government to the ""service of the people"", as Sir Keir said so many times – to be competent, with clean heels. For the government's number two to have messed up her tax affairs undermines faith in ministers' ability. As one MP put it, ""it's not even a rookie error, it's 40,000 smackers of oversight"". And for such a prominent politician to lose their job over property dealings that many of the public couldn't imagine being able to afford gives the impression, again, that politicians live in a different world. ""There's just the smell test,"" a Labour insider said. Chris Jackson / PA Angela Rayner, Sir Keir Starmer and Rachel Reeves all came under fire for accepting  permitted freebies This time last year, Rayner, the prime minister himself, and even the chancellor were all red faced for taking, albeit permitted freebies, of clothes, glasses, and gig tickets, struggling to explain why politicians are entitled to free stuff the rest of us are not. Twelve months on, Rayner is the fifth minister who has quit after their actions caused embarrassment for the government. Those clean heels look a bit scruffy now. Getty Images Nigel Farage moved forward his conference speech after Rayner's resignation The mess is, of course, a gift for Nigel Farage. At his party's conference in Birmingham on Friday Rayner's exit didn't just shove him on stage a few hours early for his speech to try to grab a space in the news cycle, it gave more ammunition to his fundamental argument. Reform's pitch rests on a claim that the two big parties are as bad as each other, and preside over a system that is bust. Does his vow he could stop the small boats in a fortnight stand up? We've been speaking to the Reform leader, and our full interview will be on the show on Sunday. Andy Rain/ EPA /Shutterstock David Lammy is the new deputy prime minister The prime minister's answer to the drama of the last couple of days? Making changes to his ministers. The decisions were made finally because of Rayner's exit but the moves have been long in the making. Downing Street's hope is to salvage opportunity out of what was fast morphing into a crisis. A No 10 source tells me: ""None of us expected it to unfold as it did, but this gives real shape and substance to a refreshed No 10 team, marking a strong new phase of this premiership."" You and I might translate that as: ""The saga over Angela's tax was a total pain in the neck, but it's given us the excuse to make some of the changes we fancied anyway."" One insider described it as moving those who were ""a bit awkward, or a bit tired"". Aaron Chown/ PA Some hope Shabana Mahmood will take a more strident approach on small boats as the new home secretary What those changes add up to depends on who you ask. One ally of the PM tells me, the reshuffle ""is all about immigration"", believing ""Shabana [Mahmood] is the one who can get a grip of this"" to solve the small boats issue or ""we're all done for"". Some of Starmer's allies have long admired Shabana Mahmood, and believe her elevation to home secretary will bring a more forthright approach to cracking the problems of the immigration system. As justice secretary she held out the possibility of castrating sex offenders. That is not exactly a proposal designed to warm the hearts of Labour Party branch meetings. But in some government circles there's a hope she'll take a more strident approach to the small boats crisis than Yvette Cooper. Andy Rain/ EPA /Shutterstock Yvette Cooper will have to contend with a visit from President Donald Trump within days of taking up the foreign brief Cooper moves to a life where she'll spend a lot more time on a plane, as foreign secretary. But those close to her believe it's a tribute to her work doing deals with countries on migration in this last year that she has been given the arguably more prestigious job. I wouldn't bet we'll see her meeting JD Vance in waders any time soon. But there is the small matter of a state visit from his boss, President Trump, in a matter of days. Different sources point to other appointments as the ones that will make the difference. The government's often stated number one priority has been to get the economy growing. You don't need me to tell you they haven't been having a great time with that. Sources suggest moving Pat McFadden, the wily political brain, into a new mega ministry to deal with welfare and skills is part of a souped-up attempt to get the country working, and moving Peter Kyle to business is a way to soothe fevered brows of industry. He takes the seat of Jonathan Reynolds, who moves to the vital role of chief whip. Given how many ructions there were on the backbenches last term, despite the party's mega majority, Reynold's fortunes keeping the party on side, or not, will be critical. Phil Noble / Reuters Angela Rayner's exit from government has brought on a change in the prime minister's top team But while the reshuffle was a major set of moves, will it dramatically change what you see from the government that runs the country? Don't expect big swerves. This is not a reshuffle that has come about because of some massive ideological bust up. It seems more about the personalities of the ministers involved than any dramatic shifts in Starmer's ambition. His allies say in the first year in office he was frustrated at how hard it was to get anything done. The hope is the new line up will work more quickly, and push harder on the government's most thorny problems. One minister said the ""time for incremental change has passed – we don't have long"", conscious all the time of Reform breathing down their neck. Will it work? That's what we'll witness as the months unfold. A senior Labour figure told me disappointedly: ""I'm not sure moving personnel is the best thing – the biggest frustration is the lack of project – that's what makes it hard to make day to decisions."" This reshuffle doesn't answer the most frequent complaint made about Sir Keir by his own party, often publicly, that it's just not that clear exactly what he stands for. ""Phase 2"" was meant to be ""delivery, delivery, delivery"". Another bout of political jargon that followed, ""change"", ""renewal"", ""security"", ""fairness"", ""milestones"", ""first steps"", you get the point. Even some of the PM's allies would admit privately that none of his chosen pitches to the public have made people's hearts sing. ""You can see the problem from Mars,"" another party insider says, ""there's not enough political direction of what he wants to do – so the policies don't lather up into anything"", they reckon. That oft-cited problem is not going to be miraculously solved by a set of HR decisions after a huge embarrassment this week. But Sir Keir's hope this weekend will be that a reboot at the cabinet table makes his government more effective - demonstrating government can work. And convincing the public of that these days would be a significant achievement. House of Common / UK Parliament/ PA The start of Sir Keir Starmer's phase two of government has not quite gone to plan Seven days ago there was an ambition that week one of ""phase two"" might be an orderly start to the term. The Rayner saga skewered that plan. Now with his new chosen team in place there is more opportunity to make things work perhaps, but fewer excuses if things go wrong. A senior party source told me: ""The test is how does the PM show how No 10's capacity for political strategy and policy making have materially changed?"" With a long list of problems and the party conference looming, we'll soon know if Downing Street can pass that test, to prove it can manage the many challenges of ""phase two"" any better than the agonies of year one.

The song, Actually Romantic, is about an unnamed fellow popstar - and social media has blown up with speculation that it's a Charli XCX diss track. In a cinema screening to accompany the new album, Swift has now revealed that the track is ""a love letter to someone who hates you"". The pop star, 35, didn't say who she was singing about, but she sarcastically thanked them for paying her attention, saying: ""It's flattering."" Watch: Did Taylor Swift write a Charli XCX diss track? Actually Romantic is the seventh track on Swift's much anticipated new album , The Life of A Showgirl. It refers to another singer, who calls Swift a ""boring Barbie"" and writes songs about how much they hate her. Fans on social media are convinced this is a response to Charli XCX's song, Sympathy is a Knife, from her Brat album, which the 33-year-old allegedly wrote about Swift. Getty Images Charli XCX scored her second UK number 1 album with Brat, which was released in June 2024 In that song, Charli writes about feeling insecure about a woman who shows up backstage at her boyfriend's gig. ""Don't know if it's real or if I'm spiralling. One voice tells me that they laugh, George says, ""I'm just paranoid"" , she sings. She adds: ""Fingers crossed behind my back. I hope they break up real quick"". Charli's then boyfriend, now husband, George Daniel, is the drummer in the band The 1975. Swift briefly dated the band's frontman Matty Healy. In her new track, Swift sings it's ""actually romantic"" how much time another popstar devotes to her. ""It sounded nasty but it feels like you're flirting with me,"" she sings. ""All the effort you've put in, it's actually romantic."" Neither star has confirmed if their songs are about each other. And last year, Swift showered Charli with compliments in an interview with New York Magazine. ""I've been blown away by Charli's melodic sensibilities since I first heard 'Stay Away' in 2011,"" she said. But the new track has fans wondering whether the alleged beef is back on. Getty Images Charli XCX, left, and Taylor Swift pictured posing backstage at an event in 2014 On Friday, a launch event film for The Life of a Showgirl dropped in cinemas. Along with a music video, it contains a mixture of song explainers and behind-the-scenes footage. In a short intro to Actually Romantic, Swift shed new light on its meaning, saying it's about realising unexpectedly that you're part of someone else's story. ""There can be this moment where it's unveiled to you, through things that they do that are very overt,"" she said. ""And, as I've gotten older, I've just started to be like, 'Oh my God, you did so much with this. It's flattering,'"" she said. ""That is, wow, that is very, very sweet of you to think about me this much, even if it's negative. In my industry, attention is affection, and you've given me a whole lot of it."" Best friends Anya, left, and Scarlett, right, attended a club night on Friday dedicated to Taylor Swift songs At a ""Swiftogeddon"" club night in Clapham, south London, on Friday night, partygoers admitted they'd spent the day over-analysing everything. Anya, 24, from Brighton, was attending the party - which played exclusively Taylor Swift songs - with her friend Scarlett, 21. Anya said she doesn't have to do a lot of the decoding ""because the internet does it for me"". She felt convinced Actually Romantic was about Charli, adding she could relate to the lyrics. ""It's universal, we've all had that feeling,"" she told BBC News. But Tanya, who's 27, and is a huge Charli XCX fan, said she didn't think it was ""very fair or feminist"" of Swift to appear to take shots at her. ""I don't think she should've done it. But, hey, freedom of expression, I guess."" Fans have long tried to decode Swift's lyrics, and work out who she is settling scores with. This new album is no exception. Away from the songs clearly about her fiancé, Travis Kelce, other new tracks that have been subject to internet speculation include Father Figure (thought to be about music executive Scott Borchetta). Some have also speculated that Cancelled! is about the status of her friendship with Blake Lively,  and that Opalite is about Kelce's ex, Kayla Nicole. Swift, who is known for penning a string of break-up tracks, has previously said she will never confirm who her songs are about.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckg24xvyzxwo,entertainment,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/dd7e/live/3de510a0-a116-11f0-b741-177e3e2c2fc7.jpg,2025-10-04T12:45:44.010000+00:00,df7f73fd133a96f0119e311a49bf115c2c201968

It's really unusual to see this kind of comedy here in Saudi Arabia."" That's how one ex-pat summed up the performances she's seen, at the first ever Riyadh Comedy Festival. ""The response was amazing, I've never seen such enthusiasm,"" she said, after sets by American stars Dave Chappelle and Bill Burr. The woman - whom we're calling Sara - said the comedians avoided discussing Saudi Arabia's controversial human rights record. But that didn't particularly bother her. ""People here don't care about those topics,"" she said. ""If they did, they wouldn't live here."" Outside Saudi Arabia, there are very different perspectives. Famous comedians such as Jimmy Carr, Jack Whitehall, Kevin Hart, Russell Peters and Omid Djalili have been intensely criticised by fellow artists for agreeing to perform at the festival. Others say they turned down invitations. On Friday, one of the few female comedians on the bill, lesbian stand-up Jessica Kirson, apologised for taking part in the event, telling The Hollywood Reporter she would be donating her fee to a human rights organisation. But some argued it’s a more nuanced picture. While human rights groups have a host of concerns about Saudi Arabia, the country has attempted to transform its image in recent years. With the festival in full swing, we’ve been speaking to fans and comedians to find out what's actually happening on the ground - and how people have reacted. What's being said... The Riyadh Comedy Festival kicked off last weekend, with an all-star - and primarily male - line-up . One of the first fans through the doors was Zain, not his real name. He attended Omid Djalili’s and Bill Burr’s sets with friends, and is booked in to see Jimmy Carr next week. The sets included ""profane content"", with jokes about gay and trans people, he said. ""The opening act for Bill Burr included a ten-minute segment which was all about sex."" Zain, who lives in Riyadh, said he was shocked to hear jokes like this, in a country which is known for being ultra-conservative socially, and where homosexuality remains illegal . The country imposes the death penalty for same-sex relationships, according to the International Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans and Intersex Association. ""I can't believe people were saying this stuff in Saudi,"" Zain said. ""Many people here haven't seen a stand-up in their lives, let alone something so explicit.” Getty Images Comedian Omid Djalili had ""done his homework"" on the region, attendees said But the jokes were well received, he said. ""In front of me, [there was a group] of local Saudi women, and they were all laughing.” Chappelle's set was also controversial, according to Sara, with lots of jokes about trans people. She said it's ""really unusual"" to hear jokes like that in the Gulf state. ""It's very haram,"" she said, using the Arabic word for forbidden. Zain said that Djalili poked fun at elements of Saudi culture. ""He joked about the niqab, and women driving. He also did a skit about how people in Riyadh think they are god's gift to earth."" But Burr seemed much more nervous, he said, and stuck to tried-and-tested jokes about his wife and kids. The audience was a broad mix of Saudi nationals and ex-pats, and there was a strong turnout, attendees said. And what's not being said Then there's what's not being said. Fans we've spoken to said the shows ""completely avoided"" any mention of the government in Saudi Arabia. Ahead of the festival, Human Rights Watch argued the festival was an attempt by the Saudi regime to ""whitewash"" its abuses. The group warned Saudi dissidents, journalists, and human rights activists were being unjustly detained. And it urged everyone performing in Riyadh to use the opportunity to speak up on topics such as human rights and free speech. ""So far I've not seen one of the comedians raise these issues, not just on stage but on social media or anywhere,"" Joey Shea, Saudi Arabia researcher at Human Rights Watch, told BBC News. ""It's very disappointing."" X/Atsuko Okatsuka Alleged content restrictions placed on comedians in Riyadh Comedian Atsuko Okatsuka, who said she turned down an invitation to perform, shared excerpts from a contract that allegedly included bans on any material that could ""degrade or defame"" the Saudi royal family or religion. BBC News has not been able to independently verify the existence of such a contract. But British comedian Rosie Holt says it's extremely rare for comedians to receive content restrictions like those. ""I've only heard it happening sometimes at gigs at universities, like don't be homophobic or racist,” she told me. “But that's the exception not the norm.” 'It's morally repugnant' The timing of the festival also hasn’t been lost on its critics. Its dates, from 26 September to 9 October, coincide with the seventh anniversary of the murder of the journalist Jamal Khashoggi . Khashoggi was killed while visiting the Saudi consulate in Istanbul, Turkey, and his body cut up. A US intelligence report found Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman approved his murder. Saudi Arabia has rejected that report, and the crown prince, who is effectively the kingdom's ruler, has denied any role in the murder. ""The same guy that's gonna pay [the comedians] is the same guy that paid that guy to bone-saw Jamal Khashoggi and put him in a [expletive] suitcase,"" said US comic Marc Maron, in a standup clip that appears to take aim at Mohammed bin Salman. Holt said that if comedians were going to go to Riyadh and make jokes about the state, and ""call out Khashoggi"", then ""I'd say fair play to them - but they won't"". Jeremychanphotography/Getty Images Jack Whitehall will take to the stage in Riyadh next week ""There's that old saying, that comedy speaks truth to power,"" she said. ""A lot of these comedians have been huge defenders of free speech, and to go and perform in Saudi Arabia, where free speech is so heavily curtailed, is extraordinary. It's morally repugnant."" Alex Falcone, a comedian and TikTokker from LA, acknowledged that free speech had also come under fire in the US. But he said it was the fact the festival is government-backed that made him most uncomfortable. ""There's a difference in performing in a country and for a country. I would not do a festival if it was being paid for by the ""Trump is a great guy"" department,"" he said. Saudi Arabia's General Entertainment Authority, which announced the festival, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The Saudi Embassy in London has been approached for a comment. Chappelle, Djalili, Burr, Whitehall and Carr did not respond to BBC News. 'They're paying me to look the other way' Some comedians have been clear about what's drawn them to Saudi - money. ""They're paying me enough money to look the other way,” US comedian Tim Dillon said on a podcast. Dillon, who says he was fired from the festival following that podcast appearance, also claimed he had been offered $375,000 (£278,000) for his set, and that some of his peers were offered millions. Others have also spoken about the large fees. Getty Images The line-up also includes American superstar Kevin Hart, who performed earlier this week US star Shane Gillis said on his podcast he had declined a ""significant"" offer to perform at the event. ""I took a principled stand,"" he said. Fellow comedians have taken a dim view of their peers for ""selling out"". ""No one goes into comedy for the paycheque,"" says Holt. ""The only people who are being invited are people who already very successful,"" added Falcone. ""This has not been a tough year for Kevin Hart."" Comedians and musicians have often performed at private gigs and corporate parties. ""The difference,” says entertainment journalist Natalie Jamieson, “is that those events tend not to be disclosed, or receive such publicity. The outrage is happening now because this is happening so publicly."" 'People here are excited' It's not only comedians who have taken up large sums of money from the Saudi government in recent years. As a nation that has been heavily dependent on oil, Saudi Arabia is working to diversify itself economically, socially and culturally. Its Vision 2030 plan, spearheaded by the crown prince, includes funnelling money into sectors such as tourism, entertainment, and sports. In recent years, Saudi Arabia has won hosting rights for several major international events, including the 2034 men's football World Cup. Last month, gaming giant Electronic Arts (EA) was bought by a consortium spearheaded by Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund. The fund's portfolio also includes Newcastle United and the LIV Golf franchise. ""I'm sure there are lots of people in the West who don't approve, but people here are really excited about the transformation programme,"" said Sara. ""Saudi Arabia is trying to be an entertainment centre, and things like this comedy festival really help. There's a lot of enthusiasm here, especially among young Saudis."" Getty Images Bill Burr called the Riyadh festival ""one of the top three experiences I've had"" Speaking on his podcast this week, Bill Burr defended his Riyadh performance in the face of the backlash. ""The comedians that I've been talking to are saying, 'Dude, you can feel [the audience] wanted it. They want to see real stand-up comedy’,"" he said. ""I think it's going to lead to a lot of positive things."" Whether the festival truly permits diverse perspectives to be aired is up for debate. Zain acknowledges there is no getting away from the fact the comedians in Riyadh won’t be making jokes about the state or its leaders, as they would elsewhere. “So you can criticise them for that,” he said. But holding an event like this was helping to “open the eyes of the population”. “Every Saudi who attends a show like this will learn something. You had gay jokes, trans jokes, sex jokes, they're being really open about everything - aside from the government.""",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cwyn2yqpnnpo,entertainment,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/8c14/live/56c27be0-a066-11f0-b741-177e3e2c2fc7.png,2025-10-04T01:03:44.876000+00:00,7b8db9aebadfba2cb20ff733d3f4252c12082c43
06d7475d2ef4,Lola Young in legal dispute with Messy producer,,"Singer Lola Young has taken legal action against one of the producers of her hit single Messy in a dispute over songwriting credits. The English singer has filed an intellectual property court claim against Carter Lang, with her lawyers saying she had ""no choice"" after he claimed writing credits on four of her songs, which she ""strongly refuted"". The US producer and songwriter has not yet responded. The case was filed in London on behalf of Young and Sony Music Publishing on Wednesday. It came a day after she cancelled all shows ""for the foreseeable future"", following a collapse on stage during a performance in New York. The 24-year-old shot to fame at the end of last year when Messy became a viral hit. It spent four weeks at number one and is the second most-streamed song of 2025 so far in the UK. A statement from her lawyers said: ""It is with immense disappointment, especially given recent events, that we have had no choice but to respond to recent writing credit claims from Carter Lang on four Lola Young songs by issuing legal proceedings on her behalf. ""Carter's claims are strongly refuted and we will not allow Lola's reputation and integrity to be called into question - particularly so long after the sessions took place and agreements were put in place. ""Lola has always been authentic in her songwriting process and acknowledges songwriting contributions where appropriate. ""This dispute has been ongoing for several months and we look forward to the truth being established."" Young's representative declined to confirm which four tracks were involved in the dispute. Lang is one of four producers credited on Messy and also worked with her on a number of other tracks. He made his name by working with R&B star SZA and is now one of the most in-demand producers and writers in music, collaborating with big names including Post Malone, Justin Bieber, Renee Rapp and Rosé.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c9dx235qe04o,entertainment,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/2fd2/live/0daf3df0-a07d-11f0-bb47-b30225268691.jpg,2025-10-04T07:35:16.791000+00:00,13cfc94a4bd9e43cc56ea1700e8ce2b0b472cd9e
c669f6ba85be,Idlewild: 'Small music venues need protected like libraries',,"Idlewild: 'Small music venues need protected like libraries' Jonathan Geddes Glasgow and west reporter Prescription PR Idlewild have returned with their first album in six years Idlewild cut their teeth playing small pubs and tiny clubs around Scotland - now the indie rock veterans feel those venues need protected for generations to come. Scores of venues have been forced to close in recent years , with some never recovering from revenue lost during the Covid shutdown in 2020. ""These venues become like community centres for music fans. They need to be protected the way a library would be, as they're so important to culture,"" says guitarist Rod Jones. The group formed as students in Edinburgh in 1995 and have become one of the country's most respected bands, with their 10th album released on Friday. Both Rod and singer Roddy Woomble - speaking over a video call with the BBC - believe the record, their first in six years,  is a fine representation of a three decade long career. However such a lifespan would never have happened without finding places to play in their early days. That was harder to do in Edinburgh than Glasgow, where the group regularly gigged at the likes of legendary hangout Nice N' Sleazy. ""You can't have an interesting music scene without a hub where people can learn,"" says Roddy. ""Glasgow has always had much more of that than Edinburgh, so we struggled to find a scene when we started out. ""We ended up playing a pub to get better, but how are you supposed to learn without gigs like that?"" The band earned a reputation for great live shows Thirty years on and it is hard to find a venue Idlewild haven't found themselves playing over the years. That might have surprised people who saw the group during their early days making a chaotic racket , famously and vividly described by the NME as ""the sound of a flight of stairs falling down a flight of stairs"". However a more reflective and melodic sound emerged, with 2002 release The Remote Part making Idlewild known as much for poetic lyricism as much as punky energy. In recent years the band - who despite line-up changes have always retained a core of Roddy, Rod and drummer Colin Newton - revisited the record for a series of shows playing it in full. That decision wound up inspiring their future as well as celebrating the past. ""Those 20th anniversary concerts of The Remote Part helped us reset and refocus on what we wanted to do next,"" explains Roddy. ""Anniversary shows always feel like you're putting a spotlight on the past and I don't like that until I'm actually doing them. ""I much prefer to focus on the now, normally. But then you do the gigs, and they're absolutely brilliant because everyone is so excited to hear a record they love."" Getty Images Idlewild in 1999 with a line-up including bassist Bob Fairfoull, who left the group in 2002 The year 2025 has been dominated by another example of nostalgia, in the shape of the Oasis reunion tour . Idlewild were never part of the 90s Britpop movement the Gallaghers fuelled, taking inspiration from American alternative rock rather than anything close to home. However both Roddy and Rod have watched the brothers' reunion, and the emotion it generated among fans young and old, with interest. ""These concerts are cultural events and I'm really fascinated by it, because I lived through it,"" explains Roddy. ""In the 90s we'd think of the 1960s as this cultural touchstone and now the 90s are being celebrated the same way. ""They've found a new generation and it feels different, because it's not just drunk old folk singing along to Roll With It, it's new fans too. ""It's a powerful thing to see these generations united by it. It's not to the extent of Oasis, but we have soundtracked some people's lives too, and we have two generations [of fans] now."" Getty Images The band's new release suggests a prosperous future. Both Roddy and Rod feel the album combines elements from throughout the band's career. It results in a fitting reflection of the group, from the towering rock of opener Stay Out of Place to the quickfire pop of Like I Had Before and snappy indie on Writers of the Present Time. ""I think we have made the best version of ourselves, in an honest way,"" says Rod, who also produced the record. ""It's not what we thought it would be when we first started making this record, it took some different turns and we almost flexed the muscles of what the band can do at times. ""We've definitely overcooked things in the past. Quite often that was for the better but what was important to me this time was to be really focused."" Idlewild UK tour The group will shortly hit the road for a run of dates across the UK, concluding with December shows in Aberdeen, Dundee and Glasgow. Going on tour is a harder proposition for the band now, given they have other responsibilities with family life. They also live in different parts of the country, with Rod in Edinburgh and Roddy settled on the scenic isle of Iona. But Roddy says live shows are always welcome, whether singing new or old material. ""When I sing When I Argue I See Shapes, that was written when I was 19 or 20. A lot of the audience were presumably the same age when they heard it, or younger, and it's like you all shape-shift back to that age. ""That's the cool thing about gigs, everyone becomes themselves when they were first hearing it again. ""Or maybe I'm just overthinking it!""",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cz08jpg9181o,entertainment,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/96c7/live/d95b9360-a148-11f0-9be2-514f62a90aaf.jpg,2025-10-05T08:12:20.654000+00:00,ea47b7e18c150e631396efa9a2efe9ffc8f488ce
03c6b6f168a1,Sean 'Diddy' Combs sentenced to more than four years in prison,,"Hip-hop mogul Sean ""Diddy"" Combs was sentenced to just over four years in prison on Friday after being convicted on prostitution-related charges involving his two ex-girlfriends. Combs' attorneys argued for a 14-month sentence, saying their client is reformed after serving 13 months in a New York jail, but prosecutors wanted 11 years, citing his domestic violence history. In addition to prosecutors detailing Combs' abuse, the court heard from several of Combs' children, some openly sobbing; defence attorneys who called him inspiring; and finally, an apologetic Combs himself. In the end, Judge Arun Subramanian said a significant sentence was required as a  deterrent, and to send a message. Before the judge delivered the 50-month sentence, Combs addressed the court - his first public words since the trial began. Combs apologised to his victims, specifically naming his two ex-girlfriends, Casandra Ventura, and ""Jane"", who testified under a pseudonym. ""My actions were disgusting, shameful, and sick,"" he said. ""I got lost in excess, I got lost in my ego."" He went on to apologise to his mother and his children. ""I'm so sorry. They deserved better,"" he said, referring to his seven children, most of whom were in the courtroom. Then he begged the judge for a second chance, saying he would never jeopardise time with his family again. ""I ask your honour for mercy. I beg your honour for mercy,"" Combs said. ""I don't have nobody to blame but myself. I know that I've learned my lesson."" In the nearly two-month federal trial in New York City, prosecutors accused Combs of using his celebrity status and sprawling business empire to run a criminal enterprise and sex traffic his former girlfriends. Prosecutors argued Combs sex trafficked women through ""freak-offs"", or encounters in which he would pay male escorts to have sex with his girlfriends while he watched and filmed. The government argued Combs coerced the women into unwanted sexual encounters with drugs and physical violence. Combs, 55, was found not guilty in July of the most serious charges against him, racketeering conspiracy and sex trafficking of his two ex-girlfriends, Ms Ventura and ""Jane"". He was convicted on two charges of transportation to engage in prostitution. For most of Friday morning, Combs maintained a non-reactive demeanour, sitting back in his seat and listening quietly as prosecutors accused him of ruining his victims' lives. Prosecutor Christy Slavik argued that the harsher sentence was more appropriate for the severity of his actions. A lighter sentence would ""let the defendant get away with years of domestic violence and abuse,"" she said. ""Today is about accountability and justice,"" she said. Citing victim statements and testimony from Ms Ventura and Jane Doe that detailed domestic violence in their relationships with Combs, she reminded the judge of photos the court saw of the two women's injuries they say Combs inflicted. ""He didn't need the money, his currency was control,"" the prosecutor says. ""This is a defendant who will pose a danger at any age."" However, the defence argued that Combs ""is not a pimp"" and that the prostitution charges on which he was convicted did not apply. ""All pimps share one aggravating factor,"" said attorney Jason Driscoll. ""They make money."" The conviction was based on the Mann Act, passed in 1910, which criminalised transporting women and girls for ""the purpose of prostitution or debauchery, or for any other immoral purpose."" The main difference, Mr Driscoll said, is money, pointing out that Combs did not benefit financially from the offences. The defence painted Combs as reformed, describing his positive contributions at the jail in Brooklyn, New York, where he's being held and citing ""untreated trauma and a ferocious drug addiction"" as factors in his behaviour. ""Mr Combs personally inspired me,"" defence attorney Nicole Westmoreland told the court, choking back tears. She talked about Combs starting his own record label and clothing line, which she said also inspired other black entrepreneurs and musicians. After spending 13 months in jail, Combs was ""remorseful,"" said Ms Westmoreland. ""Your honour, he gets it, simply put."" Combs' children - some sobbing - also vouched for his transformation in prison. In possibly the most emotional part of the day, one called him a ""changed man"" and another asked for a ""second chance"" for his father. Combs looked on, appearing to hold back tears and occasionally burying his face in his hands. ""In front of you and in front of us is a changed man. He has evolved, something we haven't seen in 15 years,"" said Combs' son Quincy Brown. Delila Combs, 18,  pleaded: ""We can't watch our baby sister grow up fatherless the same way we grew up motherless... Please, please give our family the chance to heal."" Afterwards Judge Subramanian thanked them, saying they would help him in his decision. Combs will get credit toward his 50-month term for the roughly 13 months he has served in jail before and during the trial. He also will be required to pay a $500,000 fine. After the hearing, Combs' attorney Marc Agnifilo said the legal team is planning to appeal the decision. In his sentence, the judge said Combs' actions were more than being a consumer of prostitution, like the defence had claimed, and that he was not convinced Combs would not reoffend if released. The defence played a 15-minute video highlighting Combs' achievements, and  Judge Subramanian acknowledged that he considered his involvement with charities and helping the black community, and his deep family ties. But he rejected the defence's portrayal of his relationships with Ms Ventura and Jane as intimate and consensual. ""You abused them, physically, emotionally and psychologically,"" he said. Both women had trauma that will last a lifetime, the judge said. ""You had the money and the power to keep it going,"" he said. ""This was subjugation."" ""This is the reality of what happened.""",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/czx0gx227z4o,entertainment,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/bd6e/live/fc8e9cd0-a083-11f0-bb47-b30225268691.jpg,2025-10-04T01:54:53.144000+00:00,b62c46f0e89d82d5447a71306072ce31bbd8f38a
8da3a97c4c5d,Taylor Swift feared happiness could  'dry up' her songwriting,,"Taylor Swift feared happiness could  'dry up' her songwriting Helen Bushby, Ian Youngs and Steven McIntosh Culture reporters BBC Swift recorded a string of interviews while in the UK, including The Graham Norton Show Taylor Swift has spoken of her relief that being happy in her personal life did not affect her ability to write songs for her new album, The Life of a Showgirl. ""I used to have this dark fear that that if I ever were truly happy and free, being myself and nurtured by a relationship, what happens if the writing just dries up?"" she told BBC Radio 1 as part of a flurry of UK interviews. Swift also discussed her engagement to NFL star Travis Kelce, getting her master recordings back, the Eras world tour and her love of baking. Fans have been digesting the album since its release at 05:00 BST, with some reporting that Spotify was briefly overwhelmed by the demand. Watch: Taylor Swift on Travis, new tracks and baking bread The new album includes a song which interpolates George Michael's Father Figure. The late singer's estate said they were ""delighted"" when Swift approached them about using it. ""When we heard the track we had no hesitation in agreeing to this association between two great artists and we know George would have felt the same,"" Michael's estate said on Facebook . Another song on the album, Actually Romantic, prompted speculation that the song is a diss track about Charli XCX. But others have played that down, noting that Swift said last year that she was ""blown away"" by Charli XCX's work, and praised the British star's music as ""surreal and inventive"". Here are six other things we learned from Swift's interviews, plus what critics are saying about the album so far. 1. Did being happy impact her songwriting? Getty Images Taylor Swift has made no secret of how happy she is with fiancé Travis Kelce Swift, who famously uses her lyrics as a form of emotional purging for her relationships, told Radio 1's Greg James about her fears her writing abilities might be impacted if she felt ""happy and free"". ""What if writing is directly tied to my torment and pain? And it turns out, that's not the case at all, and we just were catching lightning in a bottle with this record. ""But it's nice because you're from a place of happiness and love, you can go back to those places. You can look forward to other things,"" she said. Graham Norton asked her on his BBC One chat show if all the songs are inspired by her life. ""I am open about things, but in recent years I have a different perspective and like storytelling at a little bit of a distance, so it isn't like doing a complete autopsy of myself,"" she said. 2. Life and love with Travis Kelce Getty Images Travis Kelce of the Kansas City Chiefs celebrated with Taylor Swift after his team's victory at last year's Super Bowl in Las Vegas, The singer spoke affectionately in several of the interviews about how she's loving life with Kelce. ""He's such a natural, just in life. He's just never been nervous about anything in his entire life, so it's pretty fun,"" she told Heart's Emma Bunton and Jamie Theakston. ""He's fun and vibrant and has this infectious personality, makes me laugh so much. There's a line in a song that says, you just wanted a best friend who you think is hot - and that's kind of it!"" That song is Wi$h Li$t, from the new album, which includes the lines: "" Please, God, bring me a best friend who I think is hot / I thought I had it right, once, twice, but I did not ."" Her prayers, it seems, have now been answered. She added: ""It's this interesting thing, that you've been you your whole life, but we are different shades of ourselves at different volume levels, and this person came into my life and everybody's like, 'Yeah, you've never been so you'. ""People fuel you, they fuel every part of you, and they make you walk taller, and they make you present in a more vibrant way. And hopefully that bleeds into the music too."" 3. Engagement ring hint 18 months ago Instagram/Reuters Travis Kelce and Taylor Swift got engaged in August Swift showed off her diamond engagement ring, which she confirmed Kelce designed with an ""amazing jeweller"" called Kindred Lubeck. ""She does all of her gold engraving by hand,"" Swift told Heart. ""I just thought all of her stuff was so cool, so I'd shown him a video a year and a half ago. ""And he was just paying attention to everything, it turns out, because when I saw the ring I was like, 'Aaahh, I know who made that!' ""And also that you listened to me. It was like, you really know me. I didn't know what I would want, but he did somehow. And that's kind of a flex."" Kelce popped the question in his garden, surrounded by lavish flower arrangements, straight after the couple recorded an episode of his podcast in August. ""He really crushed it in surprising me,"" she told Norton. ""While we were talking on his podcast, he had a complete garden built out the back of his house to propose in. He went all out – 10 out of 10."" Asked when the wedding is happening, Swift joked, ""you'll know"", adding that it will not be until she has finished promoting the new album. ""I want to do the album stuff first, and the wedding is what happens after in terms of planning,"" she said. ""I think it will be fun to plan."" 4. The ups and downs of touring Getty Images Taylor Swift's Eras Tour lasted nearly two years, with 149 shows spanning five continents Swift's Eras Tour was an ""astonishing challenge"", she told Hits Radio's Fleur East, Will Best and James Barr, saying how proud she was of her crew, performers and indeed herself. The tour famously became the first in history to surpass $1bn (£786m) in ticket sales when it ended in December after nearly two years. It featured a 44-song setlist lasting more than three hours, with 149 shows spanning five continents. All this meant setting herself some tough goals. ""So you're like, don't get sick, don't let any outside noise into your head, focus on only this one thing,"" she said. Swift wrote and recorded her latest album at the same time as during her recent Eras Tour. Swift invited BBC Radio 1 presenter Greg James to her wedding during their interview Speaking to BBC Radio 2's Scott Mills, she explained:  ""I would go from three shows in a stadium, fly to Sweden [to record it], fly back to the tour, fly to Sweden."" So has she ""got the itch"" for another tour for her new album? ""No, no, I'm gonna be really honest with you,"" she told James. ""I am so tired when I think about doing it again, because I would want to do it really, really well again."" Capital Radio's Jordan North heard how she still finds time to put her feet up. ""When you're inspired to write, for me that's the most fun possible,"" she said. ""But also, I lay around and watch so much TV, just rotting."" 5. Preferring baking to social media Getty Images Swift, pictured in 2019, said she would rather be focusing on hobbies than scrolling Swift explained she tries to be very measured about how she uses her phone and social media, with her focus on being ""peaceful and happy"". ""I really am not much of a scroller at all,"" she told Hits Radio.

She added: ""When there's so much of any type of opinion about me, it's like, don't put that in my brain... ""We live in a moment of a lot of rage-baiting and getting attention has now been monetised. So you have to know what world we live in and choose what reality you want to be in.""

Getting her master recordings back Getty Images Swift was championed by her fans for reclaiming her master recordings The singer also discussed how she bought back the master recordings of her earlier albums this year , something she described as ""a lifelong dream"". ""I don't respond to stuff generally, but not owning it really pissed me off,"" she told Norton. ""I didn't think I should be given it – I was happy to pay and at a premium. I am glad I spoke publicly about it and my fans got behind it and championed it. ""I couldn't believe it happened. Travis and I were in tears when it did. Every time it is mentioned, I get a wave of euphoria still."" In the music industry, the owner of a master recording controls the way it is distributed and licensed. The artist still earns royalties, but controlling the masters offers protection over how the work is used in future. To date, she has released four re-recorded albums - known as ""Taylor's Versions"" - with dozens of bonus tracks and supplementary material. What have critics said about the new album? TAS Rights Management Meanwhile, The Life of a Showgirl has received broadly positive reviews from critics, some of which have been shared by Swift on social media. Rolling Stone's Maya Georgi awarded the album five stars, saying Swift ""hand-picks elements from all of her eras, just as she did on tour, and combines what works best"". In a four-star review, the Independent's Roisin O'Connor said: ""The Life of a Showgirl might be one of her most uneven records, but she's as compelling as she's ever been – the showgirl, the ringmaster and the circus all in one."" There was a colder reception from the Guardian's Alexis Petridis, whose two-star review said the album was ""dull razzle-dazzle from a star who seems frazzled"", while the Financial Times' Ludovic Hunter-Tilney said the album was ""charismatic, but lacks sparkle"". But the Telegraph Neil McCormick awarded four stars, noting: ""The overwhelming emotional mood is relief. It pervades the songs, a self-soothing blanket of gratitude that she has been rescued from solitude.""",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c9312173ydko,entertainment,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/04db/live/c598aaf0-a050-11f0-b687-23a5afa8b42e.jpg,2025-10-03T12:13:24.878000+00:00,7cc966175a1ca0cfd9bef1855c075c4d3e1028ba
b97fd4cc37a9,Keeping Up Appearances star Patricia Routledge dies at 96,,"Keeping Up Appearances star Patricia Routledge dies at 96 Ian Youngs Culture reporter BBC Actress Dame Patricia Routledge, known for playing Hyacinth Bucket in classic TV sitcom Keeping Up Appearances, has died at the age of 96. She also starred in Alan Bennett's TV monologues and played BBC One's amateur sleuth Hetty Wainthropp, while also enjoying an acclaimed stage career. Her agent told the PA news agency on Friday that she died ""peacefully in her sleep this morning surrounded by love"". The BBC's director of comedy was among those paying tribute, saying she ""made millions laugh and left a legacy that will always be remembered with gratitude and admiration"". Dame Patricia as Hyacinth Bucket with Clive Swift as long-suffering husband Richard in Keeping Up Appearances Keeping Up Appearances creator Roy Clarke said in a statement to BBC News: ""I'm sorry, as I'm sure so so many people will be to hear of the death of Patricia Routledge. ""It's a fortunate coincidence to find your scripts in the hands of so accomplished an actor. She was a singer and it showed in the way she could use her voice without music. It was an instrument. ""On top of such skills she was also a very fine physical clown. ""With those talents she took my scripts to the heights. I can only salute her talents and regret their passing."" Dame Patricia was best known as Hyacinth Bucket - pronounced ""bouquet"" - a comic creation who lampooned the extremes of English pretension and snobbery. ""She's an absolute monster and I enjoyed playing her enormously,"" the actress once said. Keeping Up Appearances ran from 1990 to 95, and the following year she was voted the nation's most popular actress at the BBC's 60th anniversary awards. Announcing her death, her agent's statement added: ""Even at 96-years old, Dame Patricia's passion for her work and for connecting with live audiences never waned, just as new generations of audiences have continued to find her through her beloved television roles. ""She will be dearly missed by those closest to her and by her devoted admirers around the world."" 'Loved around the world' Jon Petrie, the BBC's director of comedy, said he was ""so sad"" to hear of her death. ""She was an actor of remarkable range, but her portrayal of Hyacinth Bucket in Keeping Up Appearances has to be one of the most iconic performances in British comedy,"" he said. ""She took a character on the page and gave her such truth, precision and warmth that Hyacinth became part of the national conversation; instantly recognisable, endlessly quotable, and loved around the world. ""Whatever she did, she brought impeccable craft, and in doing so inspired generations of writers, performers and audiences."" Routledge starred with Derek Benfield (left) and Dominic Monaghan in Hetty Wainthropp Investigates The Birkenhead-born star was celebrated for her performances on stage as well as screen after starting her career in the theatre in the 1950s. Following roles in London's West End, she established herself in the US when she won the Tony Award for best lead actress in a musical on Broadway in New York for Darling of the Day in 1968. She was as adept at serious drama as she was at musicals and comedy - she appeared in Richard III and Henry V for the Royal Shakepseare Company, then won an Olivier Award for best actress in a musical for Candide in the 1980s. The 80s also saw her become a true national TV star - playing Kitty in Victoria Wood's As Seen on TV, and delivering three of Bennett's renowned Talking Heads monologues, including 1988's A Lady of Letters, for which she received a Bafta Award nomination. Alan Bennett wrote his first Talking Heads monologue for Routledge, and two subsequent instalmets She earned two further Bafta nominations, for Keeping Up Appearances, in 1992 and 93, then starred in the title role as a retired woman on a quest to solve crimes in Hetty Wainthropp Investigates between 1996 and 98. Broadcaster Gyles Brandreth, a friend, told BBC Radio 4's The World At One she was ""an extraordinary person"", adding: ""I think she was a remarkable actress because she was a remarkable human being."" She was ""a very decent, strong, independent, intelligent person and a mistress of her craft"", he said. He recalled falling in love with her when he saw her on stage in a Noel Coward compilation in the 1970s. ""Noel Coward admired her. Everybody admired her,"" Brandreth said. ""Alan Bennett loved writing for her. She was one of Victoria Wood's favourite human beings. What's interesting, of course, is she entered the national consciousness as Hyacinth Bucket. She epitomised that character, but her versatility was extraordinary."" Getty Images She starred in The Importance of Being Earnest at Chichester Festival Theatre and a West End transfer in 1999 Actress Kerry Howard, who played the young Hyacinth Bucket in a one-off BBC prequel, said Dame Patricia would be ""remembered forever"". ""She was a monolithic talent who became a comic beacon to me,"" Howard said. ""I would watch her every week as Hyacinth and then spend the rest of the week pretending to be her. ""She was my first drama teacher - although we never ever actually met, she has informed so much of my comedic sensibilities. ""A wonderful clown has left this world, but I'd like to think her energy and gifts go beyond the grave."" 'A supreme actress' The actress appeared numerous times at Chichester Festival Theatre near her home in West Sussex, and the venue's artistic director Justin Audibert and executive director Kathy Bourne paid tribute to her as ""irreplaceable, inimitable and unforgettable"". ""Patricia Routledge was a supreme actress. Her talents were particularly associated with comedy, though her range was far greater than that,"" they said in a statement. ""She was not only a national treasure, she was a Chichester treasure too - a stalwart supporter of the city and community, and of the Festival Theatre whose stage she graced for five decades.""

The rock legend died in July at the age of 76 , less than three weeks after a star-studded farewell concert in his home city, Birmingham. ""What a great way to go out that gig was,"" he said in one of his final interviews for the documentary. Sharon & Ozzy Osbourne: Coming Home followed the final three years of his life and was broadcast on BBC One on Thursday.

""I couldn't get the words out,"" recalled Ozzy, adding that it had been ""torture"" to have to sit down on a throne to perform due to a serious spinal injury. ""The only thing that was terribly frustrating for me, I had to sit there instead of running across the stage,"" the former Black Sabbath frontman said. ""I wanted to get up and sing so much. It was very humbling to sit in that chair for nine songs."" As well as Black Sabbath, the event featured performances from an array of artists they influenced, such as Metallica and Guns N' Roses.

The Prince was speaking to the actor Eugene Levy in Windsor, for the Apple TV+ show The Reluctant Traveller. In a revealing conversation, the actor asked Prince William about his future role as King. ""I think it's safe to say that change is on my agenda,"" he said. ""Change for good, and I embrace that, I enjoy that change. I don't fear it, that's the bit that excites me, the idea of being able to bring some change. Not overly radical, but changes that I think need to happen."" AppleTV+/PA Schitt's Creek star and co-creator Eugene Levy was given a tour of Windsor Castle by Prince William The prince made the comments as he gave Levy a tour of Windsor Castle. William arrived to meet the actor on an electric scooter that he said he used to get around the castle grounds. He said he had been a fan of the American Pie series of films – the bawdy coming-of-age movies in which Levy played a long-suffering father. During the tour of some of the castle's grandest rooms, Prince William also spoke about his family history. ""I think if you're not careful, history can be a real weight and an anchor around you, and you can feel suffocated by it, and restricted by it too much. And I think it's important to live for the here and now."" Prince Willam stresses the importance of tradition but says he isn't afraid to ask questions to keep the monarchy relevant.

It's an informal setting where the Prince seems relaxed especially when talking about his family and how his children coped when their mother was unwell. ""We try to make sure we give them the security and the safety that they need,"" he told Levy. ""And we're a very open family, so we talk about things that bother us, and things that trouble us, but you never quite know the knock on effects that it can have. ""And so, it's just important to be there for each other and to kind of reassure the children that everything is okay."" AppleTV+/PA They shared a Guinness and a sweet cider in a nearby pub The interview does not touch on the state of relations with Prince Harry. But Prince William does mention his brother when asked about his experience of royalty growing up with the intense scrutiny his mother and father faced. ""I hope we don't go back to some of the practices in the past that Harry and I grew up in. And I'll do everything I can to make sure we don't regress in that situation.""

I wasn't thinking about it in my own mind as any kind of scoop,"" he said. ""He was telling me what his thoughts were and we were able to have a little back and forth. It was a totally surreal day for me."" And as the prince and the actor finish their pints and round off their day together, the prince says he wants to create a world his son would be proud of.

6e335b79c2d1,Ghost of Yōtei: PlayStation puts blockbusters back on the menu,,"Ghost of Yōtei: PlayStation puts blockbusters back on the menu Tom Richardson BBC Newsbeat Sucker Punch Ghost of Yōtei follows the story of Atsu, a warrior on a quest for revenge PlayStation fans and PlayStation haters don't usually agree. But there's one complaint (or insult, depending on who you ask) that's been coming from both sides. ""Where are all the games?"" Big-budget, single-player blockbusters from in-house studios have been the key to Sony's console success. In the PlayStation 4 days fans got a steady stream of cinematic adventures, but that's felt more like a trickle since 2023's Spider-Man 2. However, Sony's newest release - Ghost of Yōtei - is a return to its proven triple-A format. BBC Newsbeat spoke to Nate Fox, a creative director at Sony-owned studio Sucker Punch, about the wait for the game and some of the reasons behind it. Firstly, what took so long? Sucker Punch's latest is a follow-up to 2020's feudal Japan-set adventure Ghost of Tsushima, one of the last big PS4-exclusive releases from Sony. ""Games do take a long time to make, so it's no small chunk of your life,"" says Nate. Ghost of Yōtei relocates the action a few hundred miles north, to the Honshū region, and the setting a few hundred years later, to 1603. This time the story follows Atsu, a female warrior on a quest to exact revenge against the Yōtei Six - a group of warlords responsible for her family's murder. With a previous game to build on, it's not a completely fresh start but, Nate explains, the project is still a huge undertaking. Just having a new main character, for example, requires input from writers, animators and character designers, to name just a few of the roles involved. Behind the scenes there are many, many more. Sucker Punch Ghost of Yōtei provides a larger open-world environment for players to explore Although Sucker Punch has roughly 200 employees at its base near Seattle, many hundreds more work on its games. The credits for Ghost of Tsushima, for example, contained about 1,800 names. Some of those will be from abroad, or from outside companies that specialise in certain technical fields. ""Making a video game requires all sorts of different skills, from incredibly technical people... to people who are very driven by emotions, like our writing staff,"" says Nate. ""And these teams work in co-ordination. It's like conducting an orchestra. ""You need to have all of the elements coming together."" Nate says that a dizzying number of elements can go into a single scene - from music to the programming that makes leaves blow across the screen at a pivotal moment. ""All these teams have to have a sense of where they're going,"" says Nate. A sense of direction is something fans have accused PlayStation of lacking in the last few years. Under its previous boss, Jim Ryan, the division launched development on 12 online multiplayer titles, known as ""live-service"" games in the industry. Some of the most famous examples, such as Fortnite, Roblox and Call of Duty, keep players engaged for months and generate huge amounts of money. Sony has had success in the space with last year's Helldivers II, but a disastrous failure with Concord , which was taken offline just two weeks after its release. It has since cancelled multiplayer projects based on some of its most popular series, including God of War and The Last of Us. Pursuing the multiplayer market is a strategy Sony has admitted is not entirely ""going smoothly"", but it's said some titles with online elements, such as Gran Turismo and baseball game MLB: The Show, have performed well. The stars of its most recent promotional showcase were Saros, a follow-up to 2021's Returnal, and the long-awaited Wolverine game from Spider-Man maker Insomniac - both single-player games. Marvel/Insomniac Wolverine is one of two big single-player exclusives due to hit PlayStation in 2026 High-profile releases can be magnets for controversy, as Sucker Punch recently found when a developer's joke about the death of right-wing American activist Charlie Kirk prompted a backlash. The studio eventually fired the employee involved, and founder Brian Fleming told journalist Stephen Totilo that ""celebrating or making light of someone's murder is a deal-breaker for us"", when asked about it. Some right-wing video game influencers have also attacked Ghost of Yōtei for featuring a female protagonist. Nate says it was an ""unconventional choice"", but key to the story the developers wanted to tell of an underdog defying society's expectations. As the game progresses, Atsu's reputation as an Onryō - a vengeful spirit found in Japanese folklore - grows. ""People think there's no way this woman could have taken out members of the Yōtei Six unless she is a supernatural creature,"" says Nate. Big releases can also invite another kind of scrutiny - hype. With the gap between new games widening, it puts pressure on developers to deliver something that will impress fans. How do you cope? ""Certainly there's a lot of expectation that games will be beautiful and emotionally compelling,"" says Nate. ""And that pressure definitely gets us going, but it's nothing compared to the pressure we put on ourselves.""

County council leader Mick Barton banned the Nottingham Post and its online arm, Nottinghamshire Live, from speaking to him and other councillors ""with immediate effect"" on 28 August. Law firm CMS LLP served the council with a legal letter on Tuesday on behalf of Reach, the organisation that runs the publisher, calling for the ban to be withdrawn in full. The county council's team manager for litigation, Geoff Russell, responded to the letter on Thursday and said it would now provide the Post with press releases and invite them to council events. However, the Post said it remained ""unclear"" whether Barton would now speak to them, but added they were ""committed to building a working relationship going forward"". Barton has been approached for comment. Council leader Mick Barton has said his door is ""always open"" to the local newspaper, despite refusing to speak to its reporters According to the Post, the ban was prompted by an article about local government reorganisation , written by its agenda editor Oliver Pridmore. The authority also stopped sending press releases to the publication and inviting them to council events. But Barton later clarified the ban only applied to the issuing of press releases and to him personally . Barton later lifted the ban for the three BBC-funded Local Democracy Reporting Service journalists who work out of the publication. The Post believed the ban was in breach of local government regulations, Article 10 of the European Convention on Human Rights - in relation to freedom of expression - and the council's own councillor code of conduct. ""I'm pleased this unprecedented ban has been lifted and the situation finally resolved, so that we can continue to get on with our jobs as we always have done,"" said senior editor Natalie Fahy.

A forthcoming Peaky Blinders film, set at the start of the war, will see Cillian Murphy reprise his role as gang leader Tommy Shelby. That will now be followed by two new TV seasons, which ""will be rooted in Birmingham and will tell the story of a city rising from the ashes of the Birmingham blitz"", creator Steven Knight said.

A four-month-old Spencer Elden was pictured swimming naked underwater on the 1991 LP's famous cover. He sued the rock band and photographer Kirk Weddle, but a judge has ruled that ""neither the pose, focal point, setting, nor overall context suggest the album cover features sexually explicit conduct"". A lawyer for Nirvana said: ""We are delighted the court has ended this meritless case and freed our creative clients of the stigma of false allegations."" Mr Elden originally filed a lawsuit in 2021, arguing that his identity and name were ""forever tied to the commercial sexual exploitation he experienced as a minor which has been distributed and sold worldwide"". US District Judge Fernando Olguin dismissed it in 2022 because Mr Elden submitted it after the 10-year limit for filing a civil case. An appeals court overturned that decision, allowing Mr Elden to refile the case. However, Judge Olguin has now ruled that, beyond the fact Mr Elden was naked, nothing came ""close to bringing the image within the ambit of the child pornography statute"". He likened the image to a family photo of a child bathing, and said it is ""plainly insufficient to support a finding"" of child pornography. ""Nudity must be coupled with other circumstances that make the visual depiction lascivious or sexually provocative,"" Judge Olguin wrote, quoting from an earlier ruling. The judge also cited factors including the presence of Mr Elden's parents at the photo shoot, the fact the photographer was a friend, and the fact he had previously ""embraced and financially benefitted from being featured on the album cover"". Mr Elden's legal team told Rolling Stone they ""respectfully disagree"" with the decision and plan to appeal.

They were found in the archive of Kretzmer, who died in 2020 aged 95 , after it was donated to Cambridge University Library . A letter that Kretzmer wrote to theatre producer Cameron Mackintosh in 1987 referenced ""unpleasant actions taken by others to downgrade my credit and contribution"". ""I think it will clarify matters if I spell out, for the first and I hope only time, the straight and verifiable facts about the authorship of the English version of Les Miserables,"" he wrote. Getty Images The enduringly popular show has been performed around the world over the past 40 years ""Not many people have had the opportunity to compare my English version, page for page, with the original Paris libretto. ""So let me, as briefly as I can, point out the evidence for declaring that, in terms of the actual lyrics now being sung nightly in New York and London, there is very little indeed that can be called translation. ""Les Miserables in English is virtually a new, rewritten show."" He described it as ""a mass of material that is so totally reconceived and rewritten that there is no longer any substantial similarity between my lyrics and the 1980 Paris model"". ""I regret that this letter has to be written at all, but in view of the unpleasant actions taken by others to downgrade my credit and contribution, I must emphasise that Les Miserables is not a show translated or re-written, but a show reborn,"" he said. The Times quoted Mackintosh as saying in reference to the correspondence in the archive: ""Herbie has a very strong moral compass as a person. He has the very quality to reflect in popular song and lyric the ethos of Victor Hugo."" Les Misérables was adapted from Hugo's 1862 novel for a French album in 1980 and a stage show the following year. The English-language version of the musical opened in London in 1985. The archive also includes a 1985 memo about auditions, which reveals Brian Blessed was among those discussed for roles in the original cast, stating he ""has been working hard on his voice, and has made considerable improvements"". It also says Fiddler On The Roof actor Chaim Topol and Exorcist actor Max von Sydow ""will, hopefully, be available to come to London... to discuss the roles of Jean Valjean and Javert"". The archive also features letters from huge names including actors Frank Sinatra and Peter Sellers, and photographs taken by director Stanley Kubrick, along with Kretzmer's cuttings from his newspaper work and his theatre career. The South African-born English writer also penned the lyrics to the 1960 song Goodness Gracious Me, made famous by Sellers and Sophia Loren. He also worked with French singer Charles Aznavour on his 1974 hit She. Word changes discovered Dr Liz Savage, special collections assistant at Cambridge University Library, helped to catalogue the Les Misérables sections of the archive. She found many edits in Kretzmer's second draft of the musical, including changing ""common"" to ""angry"" in the song Do You Hear The People Sing? The song, which has been sung in protests around the world, begins: "" Do you hear the people sing?/ Singing the song of angry men. "" The archive also reveals how Kretzmer tried out various other words first, including ""valiant"" and ""fearless"", before deciding on ""angry"". Documents also show that the song Stars was in danger of being cut, before pressure from Kretzmer and others to keep it, writing: ""We must altogether disassociate ourselves from the decision to cut Stars. We do not agree that the show is weakened by the inclusion of this song."" Kretzmer's widow, Sybil, said: ""The prestige of Cambridge University reflects the impact and influence of Herbert's work, and we know the archive will be preserved by the Library and live on for generations to come, just like Les Miserables itself.""",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx2518579w9o,entertainment,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/dd01/live/26656f90-9f74-11f0-9ccd-4dc2d8fa5ad2.jpg,2025-10-02T11:01:51.484000+00:00,68d79192aa4613c1606d5135a3210a9bd0d683a0

CMAT, whose real name is Ciara Mary-Alice Thompson, was due to play in London on Thursday on her Euro-Country tour, following the release of her third album in August. She was scheduled to perform in Manchester, Leeds, Newcastle, and Glasgow over the coming week. Thompson confirmed she would cancel her upcoming concerts after learning she had an infected wisdom tooth.

a43b0eea3bd7,Taylor Swift: The Life of a Showgirl is a triumphant pop victory lap,,"Taylor Swift: The Life of a Showgirl is a triumphant pop victory lap Mark Savage Music correspondent TAS Rights Management Taylor Swift's 12th album comes from ""the most infectiously joyful, wild, dramatic place"", she said ahead of release The last time we met Taylor Swift, she was spiralling. Her last album, The Tortured Poets Department, was an emotional purge - a stunned post mortem of two bitter, messy break-ups. We found her at her lowest, ""crying at the gym"" and ""pissed off"" at wasting her youth on a six-year relationship with British actor Joe Alwyn, that ultimately fizzled out. Eighteen months later, she's back with the latest update from her bureau; and the story is very different. Recorded in stolen moments during the record-shattering Eras tour, it finds the 35-year-old happy, energised and newly in love with NFL star Travis Kelce. ""This album is about what was going on behind the scenes in my inner life during this tour, which was so exuberant and electric and vibrant,"" she said in an appearance on Kelce's New Heights podcast last month . To capture that dynamic, she produced the album not with her longtime collaborator Jack Antonoff – whose pillowy productions defined the sounds of Midnights, and Tortured Poets Department – but with Swedish pop masterminds Max Martin and Shellback, who previously worked with Swift on hits like Shake It Off and I Knew You Were Trouble. The goal, said Swift, was to make a tight, compact album of ""bangers"" (that's hit songs, not sausages) with ""melodies that were so infectious that you're almost angry at it"". But enough preamble. Is The Life of a Showgirl a rhinestone-studded success, or a chorus line catastrophe? Watch: Taylor Swift on Travis, new tracks and baking bread Getting straight to the point: It's a triumph. It is a combination of compelling songwriting and whip-smart production that easily clears the high bar Swift has set for herself. Fans expecting a return to the maximalist pop of Red and 1989 might be surprised. Swift's new music is more cool and collected than her previous collaborations with Martin; tapping into the atmospheric textures of his recent hits for The Weeknd and Ariana Grande. But there's not an ounce of fat on any of these songs. At 41 minutes, The Life of A Showgirl is the shortest album Swift has released since her debut in 2006; and the laser focus is a welcome relief after the bloated word soup of Tortured Poets. Max Martin / Instagram Max Martin (right) has written more US number one singles than anyone since the Beatles, including Britney Spears' ...Baby One More Time and The Weeknd's Blinding Lights Thematically, Swift's latest lyrics have two distinct threads. Half of the album's 12 songs are about falling completely, goofily, head over heels in love. The rest tackle the seedy underbelly of fame. Along the way, we get some classics, like the image of a burlesque dancer ""glowing like the end of a cigarette""; or comparing a critic's barbs to ""a toy chihuahua barking from a tiny purse"". Elsewhere - and I can't believe I'm writing this - there's an entire song filled with playground innuendo. Getty Images Taylor Swift started dating Travis Kelce after meeting backstage at the Eras tour. The couple announced their engagement last month. The album opens, however, with a misdirect. Fans assumed that The Fate of Ophelia would tether Swift Shakespeare's story of a noblewoman who drowns in a fit of mania after being driven mad by grief. Instead, she sings about being ""saved"" from that fate by Kelce, in a crisp pop track that's packed with cute references to their relationship - including the Kansas City Chiefs, and the number 100 (the sum of Kelce's jersey number, 87, and Swift's lucky number 13). "" I heard you calling on the megaphone, "" she says, acknowledging how their romance began with Kelce publicly declaring his affection on his podcast in July 2023. "" If you'd never come for me, I might have drowned in the melancholy."" Musically, the song plays a clever trick by adding an extra bar at the end of every other phrase, as though Swift is lingering in the moment, too swept up in her feelings to continue. The album is peppered with little flourishes like that - and it's supremely satisfying. TAS Rights Management The album cover shows Swift submerged in water, coming down after a show in an ""offstage moment"", as the album is about ""what happened offstage"", she said The lovestruck theme continues on Opalite , whose breezy chords and Abba-esque harmonies unfurl like a blossoming romance; and Wi$h Li$t, where Swift extricates herself from the Hollywood pack for a life of domestic bliss. "" They want that critical smash Palme d'Or and an Oscar on their bathroom floor ,"" she observes. "" I just want you "". (Plus ""a couple of kids"" with ""a best friend who I think is hot""). But perhaps the most eye-opening tribute to Kelce is Wood - a staccato dance track, complete with a Jackson 5 guitar riff, that's essentially an extended double entendre. Therein, we find Swift superstitiously ""knocking on wood"" that their relationship will last, and knocking wood in the bedroom, in an unexpected homage to her fiancé's ""manhood"". It's so silly and unexpected that I laughed out loud. The same thing goes for Actually Romantic, a fantastically sarcastic track about a fellow pop star (unnamed), who calls Swift a ""boring Barbie"" and writes songs about how much they hate her. Over grungy guitars and a slapping drum beat, Taylor taunts them with a touch of reverse psychology. "" It sounded nasty but it feels like you're flirting with me ,"" she trills. "" All the effort you've put in, it's actually romantic."" She continues to settle scores on Father Figure - the scathing story of a backstabbing protégé, that interpolates the George Michael classic of the same name. Fans will go wild trying to uncover the subject's identity, but, to me, the song feels more like a morality tale about a music industry Svengali, who possesses the power to wipe out anyone who isn't ""loyal to the family"". Full of cinematic strings and disorientating key changes, it sits alongside No Body, No Crime, Bad Blood and Vigilante S*** in Swift's expanding catalogue of revenge anthems. Getty Images The Eras tour made a record $2bn at the box office - and will have made millions more from merchandise sales alone. The album's best track, however, is the soft-focus ballad Ruin The Friendship. Time-travelling to Swift's high school days in Tennessee, it reminisces about a boy she confined to the friend zone while yearning for a single kiss. Delicate and nostalgic, it takes a heart-wrenching turn in the third verse, when Swift's real life best friend Abigail calls to say their former schoolfriend has died, and she flies through the night to attend the funeral. In an album that's largely concerned with contentment, the regret and sadness hit doubly hard. The collection ends with the title track, a spirited duet with Sabrina Carpenter that doubles as a cautionary tale about stardom. It's the only song that really leans into the showgirl concept, with a percussive tap-dancing interlude and ostentatious key changes, as the stars trade lines about their cut-throat industry. "" All the headshots on the walls of the dance hall / Are of the bitches who wish I'd hurry up and die, "" Swift sings. Then the punchline: "" But I'm immortal now, baby doll ."" That feels like a deliberate call-back to Look What You Made Me Do, written in 2017 when Swift was at her most embattled, following a public showdown with Kanye West and months of negative press. Back then, she sang: "" The old Taylor can't come to the phone right now… Why? Oh, cause she's dead. "" In 2025, with the world at her feet, Swift can finally say with certainty that her place in pop history is guaranteed. The Life of a Showgirl is her well-earned victory lap.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn4wpe5z52qo,entertainment,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/d309/live/0fb41d10-9f69-11f0-b741-177e3e2c2fc7.png,2025-10-03T04:01:53.390000+00:00,30475383612d55cfbcea1750f53c105fcc493108

Insisting it was ""pronounced Bouquet,"" Hyacinth ran roughshod over her long-suffering husband and bewildered neighbours in Keeping Up Appearances, one of Britain's most successful sitcoms in the 1990s. Behaving like an duchess while living in a suburb, Bucket's monstrous social-climbing schemes were ultimately doomed to failure - while she battled to maintain her dignity. It was Dame Patricia's most famous role in a career that saw her win theatrical awards on both sides of the Atlantic, become the star of Alan Bennett's famous TV monologues, and become BBC One's crime-busting Hetty Wainthropp. Patricia Routledge as the indomitable Hyacinth Bucket in BBC1's Keeping Up Appearances in the 1990s Katherine Patricia Routledge was born in Birkenhead on 17 February 1929. Her father was a haberdasher and she later recalled sheltering from German bombs in the basement of his shop during the war. She studied English at the nearby Liverpool University and intended to teach. Instead, she joined the Liverpool Playhouse before training at the Bristol Old Vic. Her successful stage career took her from the provinces to the West End, and eventually to Broadway, where Leonard Bernstein chose her to star in his musical 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue in 1976. Getty Images Patricia Routledge gets ready for a performance in 1962 She had already won a Tony award for her performance in Darling of the Day. She could move effortlessly from comedies to classics. She went from Stratford-upon-Avon, appearing with the Royal Shakespeare Company and then to the National Theatre in London. There, her starring role in the stage musical Carousel involved her singing the rousing You'll Never Walk Alone. There were also various minor film roles, notably in the 1967's, To Sir, With Love, and the Jerry Lewis comedy outing, Don't Raise the Bridge, Lower the River. Her stage and radio work proved her versatility and won her awards, but it was television that provided Routledge with her most high profile roles. Getty Images Patricia Routledge and Jerry Lewis in Don't Raise the Bridge, Lower the River Early small-screen work included popular programmes like Z Cars and Steptoe and Son. And later, one of Britain's most respected playwrights, Alan Bennett, wrote a set of outstanding Talking Heads TV monologues for her. Routledge overcame her initial reluctance to perform his scripts and excelled as A Woman of No Importance and A Lady of Letters. She went onto play a lonely, middle-aged department store clerk tipped into a relationship with a kinky podiatrist in Bennett's Miss Fozzard Finds Her Feet. Finding her feet as Alan Bennett's lonely, middle-aged Miss Fozzard A comic turn as the larger-than-life Kitty on The Victoria Wood Show led to the creation of Hyacinth Bucket. Routledge recalled being sent the scripts by the writer, Roy Clarke - who had also done Last of the Summer Wine and Open All Hours. ""I had opened the script for a moment at one o'clock in the morning,"" she said, ""I read straight through and Hyacinth leapt off the page. I knew that woman, I knew several of that woman."" Keeping Up Appearances ran for five series and included four Christmas specials. In a documentary, she later claimed that fans had included Queen Elizabeth, the Queen Mother and Pope Benedict XVI. Patricia Routledge as Hyacinth Bucket alongside Clive Swift who played her husband, Richard It became BBC Worldwide's most exported programme ever and meant Routledge was recognised as far away as Botswana. For her work on the sitcom, she was voted Britain's all-time favourite actress in 1996, but after five years in the role, she felt it was time for a change. ""I brought it to an end,"" she said, ""which, of course, the BBC didn’t care for very much."" She thought that Roy Clarke was beginning to recycle ideas and recalled a piece of advice from the comedian, Ronnie Barker. ""He always left with people saying, ‘Oh, aren’t you doing any more?’ she said, rather than people saying, ‘Is that still on?’"" Patricia Routledge as Hetty Wainthropp, Lancashire housewife turned sleuth Playing the homely but astute detective in Hetty Wainthropp Investigates brought her continued success on television, but she always called the stage ""the test"". Long after she stopped appearing regularly on screen, Routledge made theatre tours both in the UK and abroad. Whenever interviewers asked the inevitable question, she asked them to spell out the word retirement because, she explained: ""It's not in my vocabulary."" She never married or had children, but told interviewers of two great affairs in her youth, one with a married man. ""I felt guilt and an acute sense that there had to be loss,"" she confessed. ""I suppose I convinced myself that it was all right for the time being because his marriage was not a living thing."" Instead, she dedicated herself to her craft, serving it with the talent, discipline and commitment that were always admired by her colleagues. Getty Images Patricia Routledge was awarded an MBE, a CBE and later became a Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire She was scathing about the BBC's decision in 2016 to bring back Keeping Up Appearances, but this time set in the 1950s and featuring a younger version of her character. Questioning the Corporation's policy of resurrecting old sitcoms, she said: ""Why are they doing this sort of thing, they must be desperate."" She had already clashed with the BBC over its decision not to commission a documentary she had written about the author Beatrix Potter (Routledge was a Patron of the Beatrix Potter Society), which eventually aired on Channel 4. On turning 90, she continued to live quietly in Chichester, where she busied herself raising money for the cathedral roof. In 2017, she became a Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire but - unlike Hyacinth - honours did not go to her head. Dame Patricia always said she thanked her Northern roots and solid family for giving her good sense with her time and her money. Nonetheless, she admitted that, should any extra cash come her way, she'd definitely spend it on ""a case of champagne"" - an appreciation of the finer things in life that she shared with her most famous character. ""I was never stage-struck,"" she said. ""I'm not stage-struck now. Nobody's more surprised than I am that I have, in fact, spent my life doing this.""",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c511ym2r2xpo,entertainment,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/4894/live/b705b4f0-80c2-11ef-ab28-17c883eb03dd.jpg,2025-10-03T10:18:22.015000+00:00,d0ca8553bad20ac1fe2ab89dd33ac312b23cedbf
2fd015612c2e,William's interview with Eugene Levy is the most open we've ever seen him,,"William's interview with Eugene Levy is the most open we've ever seen him Daniela Relph Senior royal correspondent 'Stress around family overwhelms me', Prince William says Prince William's conversation with Eugene Levy on the actor's Apple TV show is revealing on many levels. It has clarified his vision for his own reign once he becomes king, reinforced how stressful family life has been for him, and given us a few personal details about him we didn't know before. Here are our main takeaways from his interview. This was a different type of royal chat Traditionally, interviews with the Royal Family come around rarely and when they happen they are formal. There is usually a room in a palace, set up with cameras and lights. The interviewer will likely be an experienced presenter or journalist. There would have been weeks of briefing notes and discussions about subject areas. It is a tried and tested formula. But it is now clear this isn't Prince William's way. Part of his openness here comes from the setting and the context. He is at home at Windsor, he's on familiar territory, he's walking his dog, he's in the pub. William just seems more relaxed in that space, and talks more freely. The choice of interviewer matters too. He told the actor that he was a fan of his and had loved watching the American Pie films - the coming of age movies starring Levy as a long-suffering father. There have been some eyebrows raised about revealing so much to a Hollywood actor rather than a more forensic interviewer. There were no questions on his relationship with his brother, Harry, nothing on his view of Prince Andrew's place in the royal family. But even with those missing components, we still got something new and interesting. William didn't falter when asked about his children and about what kind of king he wants to be. He would have probably been more restrained and uptight if it hadn't been Levy asking the questions. AppleTV+/PA Prince William also revealed he rides an electric scooter around Windsor Castle William is set on change It has always been clear that Prince William has his own take on his public role. ""A smaller R in royal"" is how he previously referred to it. But the words ""change is on my agenda"" and not being ""suffocated"" by history make it very clear that he has a vision for monarchy that will look forward rather than back. Those who work with the prince and his family are cautious about how those words are interpreted. One palace staffer told me: ""He's not afraid to ask questions about how and why things are done. If the answer is because that's how we've always done it then he just won't accept it."" The Duchy of Cornwall  - the financial portfolio that provides an income to the heir to the throne - is cited as an example of William going in and leaving ""no stone unturned"" in terms of how it is run and what needs changing. There is new leadership there, a focus on social action and a very involved prince. One source told me that when he is king, William will be ""deep in the roots of the management of Monarchy HQ"". Don't expect the big stuff to change dramatically. There will definitely be a coronation. Trooping the Colour and Remembrance Sunday will remain fixed and important parts of the royal year, and jubilees and big occasions will still be celebrated. But William as king will have his own way of doing things. AppleTV+/PA Prince William was asked about his children and about what kind of king he wants to be He rides an electric scooter at the castle The programme is filled with small details about the prince – many of which we didn't know before. He rides an electric scooter around the grounds of Windsor Castle, but still describes himself as ""a late person"". A favourite drink is a pint of sweet cider. None of his children currently have their own phone – something he said he and the princess were strict about. He loved running down the wooden floors of Windsor Castle with his cousins when he was younger trying to avoid getting splinters. His children now do the same but the floor has been carpeted, so is less perilous. His eldest son, Prince George, now knows more about history than his father. And he describes his children's favourite activities – it is football and hockey for George, netball for Charlotte, while both Charlotte and Louis like trampolining. ""As far as I can tell they're jumping up and down on the trampoline and beating each other up,"" says their dad. Prince Harry gets a brief mention The prince's younger brother, Harry, gets one fleeting mention in the show. There are no direct questions about him, but William brings him up in a conversation. ""I hope we don't go back to some of the practices in the past that Harry and I grew up in. And I'll do everything I can to make sure we don't regress in that situation."" He was referring to some of the more chaotic aspects of his childhood and how difficult the press attention and intrusion had been. The sibling relationship still remains deeply fractured following Harry's public criticism of the Royal Family. There are no signs of that changing right now. Still, it is interesting to hear William just say his brother's name out loud in public. The strain of Kate's illness is clear Prince William has mentioned the strain of having both his wife and father unwell a number of times over the past year and a half. He doesn't shy away from discussing it again here with Levy. William is asked directly about his wife being in remission, about how his children have coped. He uses the world ""overwhelmed"" to describe how he has felt at times. It is just further confirmation of how unsettling the experience has been for him and his family and it has obviously reinforced his desire to put his wife and children first. ""It's just important to be there for each other and to kind of reassure the children that everything is OK,"" he says. Press Association Prince William has previously spoken about the strain of his wife's illness The choice of Apple TV is important The royal media teams are taking a much broader perspective on the type of media work they now do. A lot of energy is spent on their Instagram posts and YouTube channels. The King is currently working on projects with both Netflix and Amazon. Apple fits the strategy of engaging a wider number of media platforms and looking for different ways of presenting royalty globally. It's an approach that isn't without risk for William. We were told there were no agreed questions or approved areas of discussion and that he was opening up parts of Windsor Castle to the actor and film crew. But the project has worked for both Apple and Kensington Palace. Apple has a programme making headlines and Kensington Palace feels William has emerged as ""a human and easy to relate to guy"", according to sources. This was an unusual place for such an interview Sometimes royal revelations are found in unexpected places – a prince opening up to one of his favourite actors from his teenage years was a bit of surprise. But it has shown an heir to the throne managing the stresses of family with his future on his mind. A royal source summed it up. ""For all too long, we've seen the royals as perfect,"" they told me. ""Here we see William as a human being, in a pub, with a pint, chatting. ""It's the most open we've ever seen him.""",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx2r3k0d2e5o,entertainment,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/07f9/live/740154f0-a044-11f0-928c-71dbb8619e94.jpg,2025-10-02T21:02:50.615000+00:00,013e270292187d47b8590ec95f9a457967fa13f6
012465b1eb27,Steve Coogan: 'I don't want to live with Alan but I do like to visit him',,"Steve Coogan: 'I don't want to live with Alan but I do like to visit him' Paul Glynn Culture reporter BBC Alan Partridge is part of a British tradition of desperate male comedy characters which includes Captain Mainwaring, Basil Fawlty and David Brent ""Do you like my orange socks?"" asks Steve Coogan. The British actor is pointing down to a brightly coloured, Argyle patterned pair, worn with brown leather sandals. ""That's where Alan meets Steve,"" he adds. ""In the socks."" By Alan, of course, he is referring to his much-loved and often quoted comedy creation, Alan Partridge - the tactless, self-absorbed and self-styled presenter. The character first appeared as a sport reporter on the BBC Radio 4 parody news show On the Hour in 1991, with one unwitting listener writing in to say they had been ""appalled"" by his on-air behaviour. Since then he has gone on to have his own chat show, sitcom, film and podcast. Now, his 2025 return finds him funnily failing at fronting a self-funded TV documentary on mental health. Partridge, as Coogan reminds us, is like ""every superficial"" celebrity who just wants to have a public profile. ""That's more important to them than what they're saying or what they stand for,"" he adds. ""He'll take a look around for what seems the most fertile territory for him to exploit. And I think he thought, 'oh mental health... A lot of people are talking about that these days, I'll jump on that and try to make myself relevant.'"" Comedy potential Steve Coogan starred in 24 Hour Party People, The Trip and Philomena, and will lead the regeneration of his hometown Middleton in Greater Manchester How Are You? It's Alan (Partridge) shows its titular star ""bravely"" - as he puts it - investigating his own mental health and that of the nation. Addressing ""important"" topics in comedy can be cathartic but requires a constructive and kind approach, Coogan stresses, noting the intention from him and his co-writers was to ""laugh around mental health, not at it"". He says: ""Sometimes if people are worried about attaching comedy to something which is about people's vulnerabilities then they tend to avoid it because they don't want to upset people. ""Whereas we will gravitate towards that, even though it gives people anxiety or could be potentially problematic. ""But we know that the same things that make something problematic also give it a lot of potential in terms of comedy."" The character featured on The Day Today before getting his own TV shows, Knowing Me, Knowing You and I'm Alan Partridge Partridge's latest misadventures see him searching for answers as he reintegrates into British life after a year spent working in Saudi Arabia, having been cast out by the BBC again. His misguided approach - often aped on the Accidentally Partridge social media account, which shares cringeworthy clips of public figures - is ""provocative"" but, Coogan hopes, ""never mean-spirited"". The fictional Norfolk-based host can be used as a comedic ""Trojan horse"", he says, to talk about taboo subjects and to ""mock different kinds of received wisdom"". Partridge is as likely, according to Coogan, ""to mock the xenophobic little England mentality of the Daily Mail"" as he is ""the smug, self-righteousness of the Guardian, at its worst"". He continues: ""People who don't agree on everything might all laugh at Alan Partridge at the same time. ""So that's really a nice unifying thing."" Allow Google YouTube content?

Accept and continue In the 1990s and early noughties, Coogan would write material for the ambitious-yet-awkward Alan alongside Armando Iannucci and Peter Baynham. But Iannucci turned his attentions to political satires like The Thick of It, while Baynham was ""poached by Sacha Baron Cohen"" for Borat, Coogan recalls. Cocaine use affected his own work on series two of I'm Alan Partridge, he has previously admitted. The character then endured a ""fallow period"" of about seven years, as Coogan looked for other projects that would ""help me feel like I wasn't just gonna die with 'here lies Alan Partridge' on my tombstone"". He starred as Manchester music mogul Tony Wilson in Michael Winterbottom's 2002 film 24 Hour Party People, and then alongside friend and fellow comic Rob Brydon as exaggerated versions of themselves in The Trip. A blend of truth and fiction, the conceit hinted at Coogan's frustrations and ambitions to step out of Partridge's shadow into other acclaimed roles. It worked. He won a Bafta for his performance in series one, to add to his previous wins for I'm Alan Partridge. Another Bafta win and an Oscar nomination followed for 2013 film Philomena, which he wrote and starred in alongside Dame Judi Dench. The actor compares Alan to Malvolio from William Shakespeare's play Twelfth Night When Alan returned from his hiatus in the 2010s, in the YouTube series Mid Morning Matters and spoof autobiography I, Partridge, a new writing team was in place. Screenwriting brothers Neil and Rob Gibbons helped Coogan to slowly fall back in love with him. ""It took a while,"" admits Coogan. ""I was doing a live show, and I asked them to write something and it was brilliant - almost but not quite perfect. ""And since then, they've just taken the reins and they have breathed new life into the character, given me new confidence and we took it off in a different direction."" The trio worked together on the Partridge movie, Alpha Papa - alongside Iannucci and Baynham - and another Bafta-winning series Scissored Isle, as well as the TV magazine programme This Time and podcast From the Oasthouse. Coogan believes Partridge's longevity is down to him having ""evolved"" into a more ""three-dimensional"" figure, capable of evoking ""pathos"". Neil Gibbons says in the early days Partridge was surrounded by ""reasonable"" people, meaning he would often be the one saying something ""stupid"". Their trick, he reveals, was to surround him with people who are worse, like his new girlfriend Katrina. ""Alan often, in a clumsy way, says things that as an audience you agree with,"" he explains. ""It just gives you another angle of attack, as otherwise you run out of ways he can say the wrong thing or lose his temper with someone."" PA Media Coogan also compares the character to Sir Keir Starmer, who he recently criticised over Gaza in a Palestine Solidarity Campaign video alongside Paul Weller, Maxine Peake and Khalid Abdalla More sympathetic characters like his long-suffering assistant, Lynn (Felicity Montagu), and his old sidekick, Simon (Tim Key), return but with gripes of their own. Coogan thinks while older fans may feel relieved watching Alan slip on life's ""banana skins"" that they've avoided, younger viewers - with whom he is popular on TikTok - ""see their parents in Partridge"". ""They see that desperation from their parents to be relevant and not square,"" says the actor. Like for many ""white, middle-aged, middle-class men"", offers Rob Gibbons, ""the world has changed too fast for him"" and he's ""scared"". Filming in Norfolk down the years has given northerner Coogan ""a real affinity"" for the area though he admits locals love and hate Partridge in equal measure Partridge was once an ""albatross"" around Coogan's neck, but he returns to him nowadays because he ""wants to"", not because he has to. ""I don't want to live with Alan but I do like to visit him,"" says the star, who has also recently portrayed Mick McCarthy, Jimmy Savile and Stan Laurel as well as Dr Strangelove on the West End. As his socks might suggest, the 59-year-old admits he has caught himself becoming a little more like Partridge as he's got older. He has no intention of killing him off anytime soon. ""As long as I can do the other things that are really important to me, I think I will always come back and do something, as long as we can keep the standard."" And having realised that ""laughter is very healthy"", Coogan says he will keep performing comedy for ""as long as I've got breath in my body"". How Are You?

c230165d09b9,"Lady Gaga serves mayhem, magic and guest stars as UK tour launches",,"Lady Gaga serves mayhem, magic and guest stars as UK tour launches Mark Savage Music correspondent Getty Images Lady Gaga's Mayhem Ball is her eighth tour. Originally planned as a brief series of outdoor promotional concerts, she expanded the run following glowing reviews Lady Gaga is dancing on a human skull. Lady Gaga is buried in a shallow grave. Lady Gaga is serenading a corpse. Lady Gaga is also teetering around on crutches, cavorting with zombies and crossing the River Styx. Welcome to the Mayhem Ball, a magnificent and operatic tour de force; that pitches the star's inner angels and demons in a fight for her very soul. Premiered at this year's Coachella festival, it reached the UK on Monday night, for a run of eight shows at London's O2 Arena and Manchester's Co-Op Live. The transfer from outdoor festival stage to the confines of an arena only heightened the show's vampy, gothic energy - as Gaga raced through two decades of hits, from her debut single Just Dance to her latest hit The Dead Dance, from the Netflix series Wednesday. The latter came with a star cameo from two of the show's young stars, Emma Myers and Evie Templeton, who pirouetted around Gaga and her dancers in wispy bridal gowns, before breaking into choreography from the show's second season. The singer later posted video of their rehearsals on Tiktok . Getty Images Wednesday stars Emma Myers (right) and Evie Templeton (centre) joined the show for two songs - The Dead Dance and LoveDrug Getty Images The young stars embraced Gaga and waved to the crowd before making their exit The tour comes hot on the heels of Gaga's latest album, Mayhem, widely regarded as a return to high-concept pop after a spell of method acting and jazz crooning. The album, like the show, is a reckoning with her past. She questions whether her career was really worth sacrificing her privacy, her sanity and even her health, as punishing live shows exacerbated her fibromyalgia, a condition that causes chronic, full-body pain. On stage, the tussle plays out between her light side (angelic, naive, floating across the stage in flowing blonde curls) and her inner darkness (raven-haired and manic, with convulsive choreography). During Poker Face, the two sides face each other on a giant chess board; as Gaga is confronted by a doppelgänger dressed head-to-toe in face-obscuring lace (a nod to the star's 2010 Brit Awards outfit). ""What are you doing here in my house,"" screams Gaga, striking her old self to the ground and demanding, ""off with her head!"" The ghost of Gaga past re-emerges for Perfect Celebrity, writhing with camp energy in a shallow grave as she sings about the pressure and torture of stardom. For a dramatically stripped-bare version of Paparazzi, she's on crutches, snarling at photographers, but soaking up the public's adoration until it frees her to walk unaided. Getty Images The star arrived on stage in a giant, tiered dress... Getty Images ...That opened to unveil a cage full of dancers Does the story make sense? Sure, kind of. It's about as coherent as any pop concert narrative - ie not very - but Gaga's visceral commitment makes it soar. Her vocals are rich and gutsy, even through kinetic choreography that requires her to be in almost constant motion; and the music is given a gothic overhaul, painted black and scuffed up with industrial guitar chords and sawtooth bass lines. Even Shallow, Gaga's Oscar-winning A Star Is Born ballad, opens with an unsettling synth pulse , as it soundtracks the show's climactic final act. She performs it in a gondola, floating down the catwalk as she flees the chaos of the main stage for the sanctuary of her piano. Sitting down at the keys, she's finally at peace, playing the heartfelt ballads A Million Reasons and Die With A Smile, without the accompaniment of her band. ""My first big arena show was in the UK,"" she tells the audience. ""You believed in me then. Thank you for believing in me now. ""No matter what, we've found each other through the music and through community."" To celebrate, she dives deep into her songbook and plays impromptu versions of Speechless, from her 2009 Fame Monster album, and The Edge Of Glory, from 2011's Born This Way. Fans, who know the standard setlist by heart, are enraptured, singing back every word at full volume. At the end, Gaga wipes away a tiny tear. Getty Images The solo piano set is the emotional highlight of the concert After two-and-a-half hours, the show ends with Gaga announcing she has defeated the ""mistress of mayhem"". As the entire set catches fire, she's wheeled out on a hospital gurney, surrounded by dancers in red plague doctors costumes, who operate on her lifeless body. Frankenstein-like, she springs back to life for a show-stopping, floor rattling version of Bad Romance,  that feels both cathartic and celebratory. ""It's been almost 20 years,"" she reflects, ""but I want to make a pact with some of you. ""If I come back 20 years from now, will you come to the show? ""You gotta promise me now, otherwise I'm just gonna roll up with a keyboard, and I'll be playing on the street. I'll be here no matter what."" In the storyline of the show, that feels like a revelation. Gaga has found a path through the chaos, a way to keep performing without surrendering her soul. On previous tours, I've often felt her ambition was let down by self-indulgence or messy execution. Not this time. The Mayhem Ball finds the pop star operating at the peak of her powers. Fancy that.

097035ed49f9,Where is her husband?! Raye on her hit song and five-year plan to start a family,,"Where is her husband?! Raye on her hit song and five-year plan to start a family Mark Savage Music correspondent BBC Raye says there's a serious undertone to her frisky new single, Where Is My Husband! Glastonbury, summer 2025. Raye is wheeled on to the Pyramid Stage in a giant flight case marked ""Caution, contents may be fragile."" Freed by two tuxedoed roadies, the pop star teeters to her microphone in a black sequinned ball gown and does the worst thing a performer can do - plays a brand new song. ""When I think about it now, that was really bold,"" she laughs. ""I got out of that box and I was like, 'No-one knows this. Everyone hates it, everyone hates it!'"" Not quite. Because the song was Where Is My Husband!, a blistering pop-funk throwback that became an instant earworm. Fans streamed the Glastonbury performance 1.2 million times while they waited for an official release. When the single finally came out last week, it entered the charts at number four. The insanely catchy bridge – where Raye longs for "" a diamond ring I can wear on my wedding finger"" – has also gone viral on TikTok. So... has it resulted in any concrete offers? ""Someone wrote their number on a tissue the other day and I was like, 'Oh no, you're just not my type',"" she guffaws. ""He was really sweet, he just wasn't my vibe."" PA Media Raye debuted Where Is My Husband! on the Pyramid Stage at Glastonbury, backed by a full soul revue band Still, for all of the song's sass and flippancy, Raye is deadly serious about snaring a partner. ""I have a five-year plan,"" she says. ""I'll put out an album in first half of next year – although I need to finish it first - then I'll tour with my sisters. ""Ideally, around that time, it would be nice to meet my husband. So like, maybe 2027? Then we get married and have a baby. ""And I want to do enough groundwork in the next two years that I can take a year off and my career's not gone down the toilet."" It's a startling admission - a year after winning a record six Brit Awards in a single night , Raye still worries about the precarious nature of success. And, like many women, there's a fear that maternity leave will damage her career prospects. It doesn't help that she's been scarred by her past experiences with a record label that, for almost a decade, pushed her into making generic dance records while refusing to release her debut album. That's also why, having finally broken free, she's keeping a close eye on her younger sisters Lauren and Abby-Lyn Keen as they follow her into the music industry. ""I'm fiercely, fiercely, fiercely protective of my girls,"" Raye says. ""We have discussions about how to handle disrespect in a studio environment and learning how to navigate egos. ""It's really, really hard, and sometimes people are very disrespectful, so we talk about it and cry about it and go through it together."" Raye and her sisters Amma (L) and Absolutely (R) spoke to BBC News backstage at the Graham Norton Show last week Lauren, who performs under her middle name Amma, says having Raye in her corner has already paid off. Many of her friends have met male writers and producers who've diminished their contributions and made sexually inappropriate comments, she says. ""But because my older sister is Raye, it's like, 'No!' They won't move to me because they've already hit on you,"" she says. The sisters laugh raucously, but there's an undercurrent of pain. Raye was a teenager when she signed her first record deal, and experienced several instances of sexual abuse that contributed to a ""dark, dark"" period of drinking and drug-taking in her early 20s. ""It was difficult [to watch] for a little bit of time,"" says Amma, gently touching her big sister's arm. ""You were just struggling, I think."" To sing or not to sing? Witnessing Raye's experiences in the industry – both the successes and the sorrows - ultimately stopped Amma from pursuing music ""for a really long time"". It was only when her father played one of her songs to music publishers in Los Angeles that things changed. Snapped up as a songwriter, she was working with R&B artists like Flo and Nao until a meeting about her next project took an unexpected turn. ""We were meant to be talking about other artists - and 20 minutes into the meeting, they pitched me becoming an singer,"" she recalls. ""I was like, 'No, no. That's not what I'm meant to be doing.' ""But as I was driving home, I was like, 'Wow, this is the best I've felt on this [songwriting] trip. Maybe I am meant to be doing this?'"" PA Media Assignments The siblings joined Graham Norton's TV show before setting off on a joint tour at the start of 2026 She got home, took a shower, and was hit by a sudden wave of inspiration. Sitting on her bed, she sketched out a song that weighed up the pros and cons of becoming a singer. "" Don't know if I'm really wanting the fame / Something tells me I'm a bit smarter than that ,"" she sang into her tape recorder. Ironically, it was expressing those doubts that convinced her to give it a shot. The song, called What Am I Doing It For?, became the opening track of her debut EP, Middle Child. Absolutely never had those doubts. She's been writing since she was 13 - and part of the reason for her new musical pseudonym is that she ""never wants anyone to find"" the EPs she recorded in her teens. Quieter and more reserved than her sisters, her singing voice is no less breathtaking. Her latest single, a gorgeous, yearning ballad called I Just Don't Know You Yet , has been played four million times on Spotify. Written two or three years ago, it shares its compositional DNA with Raye's Where Is My Husband! ""I was lying in bed one night, and I pray a lot,"" she explains, ""and I had it really heavy on my heart to pray for my future husband. ""Then I went into the studio the next day, and the lyrics came so effortlessly - just flowing out of my heart."" Getty Images Raye brought her grandmother onto the stage at the 2024 Brit Awards, where she picked up a record-breaking six trophies If it seems odd that these fiercely talented, independent women are so preoccupied with marriage, it helps to understand the overwhelmingly supportive and loving environment their own parents created. The sisters talk glowingly about growing up in the embrace of the church, where their father would teach them piano and their mother encouraged them to sing in the choir. But the biggest praise is reserved for grandma Agatha Dawson-Amoah, who moved from Ghana to help raise the family. ""She used to carry my cello home from school on her back while pushing me in the pram,"" reminisces Absolutely. ""Lauren would just be toddling along at the side and I'd be walking ahead, pretending I'm all independent,"" adds Raye. ""And we'd all be eating jam and cheese sandwiches,"" Amma laughs (the delicacy being a result of Agatha misunderstanding the composition of a ham and cheese toastie). ""Grandma was our best friend, and our rock,"" says Raye. In fact, she even makes a cameo on Where Is My Husband!, promising the star, "" Your husband is coming soon "". The song is projected to top the charts next week, and Raye is justifiably proud of the track - which she worked on right up to the wire, only delivering the final mix eight days before the deadline to get it pressed to vinyl. It turns out the song had a troubled gestation as the pressure of following up Raye's Mercury Prize-nominated album 21st Century Blues hit home. ""When you haven't written for a long time, you start being extremely self-critical. So I was hating everything I was coming out with, and then I had to have a pep talk. ""Mike [Sabbath, producer] and I went for a walk in the woods and talked about life, and did no work for a whole day."" The chorus for Where Is My Husband! arrived, unprompted, the next day. ""It was so exciting,"" she says. ""And then we just began chip, chip, chipping away at it."" Her sisters are totally enamoured with the song and spend a good few minutes trying to sing the tongue-twisting bridge before giving up and breaking into Sister Sledge's We Are Family instead. They'll have plenty of time to perfect it next year, though, when the whole clan set off on tour together, apparently oblivious to the fact that most family road trips end in disaster. ""Back in the day, we'd have war zones over hairbrushes,"" says Raye. ""But now we're just very close."" So, could a joint album be on the cards? Maybe even a Christmas record? ""A gospel album would be better,"" says Absolutely. ""Somewhere where we can experiment and have fun and push boundaries. ""I think it'll happen in like five or six years,"" Raye suggests. ""Five or six?"" Amma says, shocked. ""I bet you money we're gonna do it before."" ""OK then,"" replies Raye. ""Once I'm married and I've got my baby."" With a final, sisterly eye-roll, Amma sighs: ""Oh my gosh , you and your baby!""

e598dc3621ee,Can Polanski's Greens turn momentum into power?,,"Can Polanski's Greens turn momentum into power? Sam Francis Political reporter Getty Images In the month since self-proclaimed ""eco-populist"" Zack Polanski took charge of the Green Party of England and Wales, there has been a noticeable change within the party. With over 20,000 new members in recent months, the Green Party is the largest it has ever been. The party appears to be trying to shed its image as well-meaning eco-warriors to become an insurgent force. While there appears to be momentum within the party, in a splintered political landscape there is a question mark over how the Greens can turn this into votes. When campaigning to become Green Party leader, Polanski promised to ""pick fights"". On the eve of his first conference as leader, Polanski was argumentative during an interview on the BBC Radio 4's Today programme when pushed to defend his deputy Mothin Ali over inflammatory comments he had made about an Israeli army reservist. This willingness to create controversy - if it wins attention and cuts through to the public - has been embraced by his party. Boldness is needed to combat voter disillusionment and rising right-wing populism, argues Rachel Millward, Polanski's other deputy co-leader. ""I guess I can't see the point of not going as big as you can go,"" says Millward. ""If we stay timid, we might gain nothing. ""Whereas, if we're bold we definitely gain people because it resonates because it's true and it's real and people are craving that honesty."" The Green Party's head of elections, Chris Williams, oversaw the Greens' best-ever general election campaign last year - it gave the party four MPs for the first time by tailoring and targeting campaigns in both Tory and Labour heartlands. But he is now recalibrating the party's approach to reflects Polanski's leadership style. ""To tailor an old adage: if you try to annoy nobody you don't excite anybody,"" is how he puts it. The Green Party see on opportunity to build on the momentum. With increased belief comes more members, more donations ""the campaigns get bigger, and the targets grow, and we win more seats, and we just build upwards and keep on going"", Williams argues. The UK's shifting electoral landscape, is also bringing growing opportunity, Williams says. ""By-elections are being won with just 27% of the vote. ""The swings we need are smaller - instead of climbing Everest, we're having to climb Snowdon now in order to win a constituency."" The party has already picked a raft of so-called ""development constituencies"" in Tory and Labour held areas across the country, though the targets are predominantly urban where traditional parties like Labour and the Conservatives are shedding votes fastest, Williams says. Some members warn a shift away from localised strategy could risk alienating the very voters who delivered the breakthrough wins in 2024. The party's two current MPs in rural areas could be particularly exposed - ex-leader Adrian Ramsay in Waveney Valley, on the border of Suffolk and Norfolk, and Ellie Chowns in North Herefordshire. Ramsay and Chowns also ran on a joint ticket against Polanski, picking up just 16% of the vote. On the ground, Millward - who co-leads the predominantly rural Wealden District Council - insists the countryside vote is not at risk. ""We've had more new members coming in, even in our rural area,"" Millward says. Getty Images Zack Polanski, Mothin Ali and Rachel Millward (l-r) are set on taking the Green Party in a new direction. For all their ideological differences, the Green Party is watching Reform UK as a case study in how to win attention and turn it into electoral support. A well-attended panel discussion on ""how to stop Reform"" at conference was notable for the number of members praising the work of the Green's foe Nigel Farage. Members argued for copying a playbook of simple messaging, emotional appeal and a willingness to provoke - albeit with different content. In his leader's speech, Polanski said: ""If Reform can rocket through the polls with a politics of despair, then it's time for the Green Party to do the same thing with a politics of hope."" But the Green Party's electoral strategy is being reshaped not just by the rise of Reform UK. There's a risk that Your Party, the emerging political force led by Jeremy Corbyn and Zarah Sultana, could take the wind out of the Green Party's sails. At 82,000 members the Green Party is the biggest it has ever been. For context Your Party claims to have had more than 600,000 sign-ups in the weeks after it launched. For Millward, all this proves is ""Labour's lost its support on the left"". ""And we are actually gaining from that as well - so it's not like a net loss to us."" The Greens have long relied on grassroots energy and volunteer labour. They now have more members to call on, but for a party trying to scale up from protest politics to serious electoral force money matters. Behind the scenes, Millward and others are pushing for a bolder approach to fundraising. She used her conference speech to argue they will be the party of ""fivers"" – emulating the micro-donations successes of US figures like Barak Obama and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. The party also needs to become ""bold enough to ask"" sympathetic donors that have sustained big parties like the Conservatives, Labour and Reform, she says. ""We're not talking about being funded by corruptive billionaires, but there are people who are with us and who would like a change."" The 2026 local elections will be a key test for the Greens. The party is aiming to hold a record 900 council seats when they contest a series of nominal strongholds, in London, Brighton and Huddersfield. The party is also talking up their chances in taking over new combined authority contests in Sussex, and in Norfolk and Suffolk. In Wales, they have high hopes the new proportional representation voting system will allow the party to gain a foothold in the Senedd. But fractured multi-party voting in a first past-the-post electoral system in England and Wales can lead to unpredictable results. It is clear the Green Party leadership see a path to victory. They must now see if voters will reward ""picking fights"" with electoral success or a bloody nose.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c9dx85q4dyzo,politics,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/193b/live/d6d4a950-a167-11f0-8b70-39bf68f49b3e.jpg,2025-10-05T10:43:16.415000+00:00,13abb7877500137130af79d8f04a8d9e24427f96
48276753a77e,Tories invoke Thatcher legacy in search of a comeback,,"Tories invoke Thatcher legacy in search of a comeback Paul Seddon Political reporter, Conservative Party Conference, Manchester Getty Images It is far from unusual to see tributes to Margaret Thatcher at Conservative party conferences. But the ghost of the Iron Lady hangs particularly heavily at this year's annual gathering in Manchester, as activists celebrate 100 years since her birth in 1925. Along with the customary cardboard cut-outs and decorative gift mugs, a special exhibition stand is displaying a selection of the former Conservative prime minister's most famous outfits from her 11 years in office. Delegates can have their photo taken for a Thatcher mosaic projected on a wall, whilst a cocktail bar has been booked for a ""Maggie's 100th"" party, with a live DJ ready to blast out ""everyone's favourite disco hits"". That the party faithful would turn to their most successful leader at this particular point in time is not surprising, even if outsiders might question the party's continued fascination with a leader it ejected from office more than 30 years ago. Kemi Badenoch, who is preparing to mark her own one-year anniversary as Tory leader next month, is grappling with how to revive the Tories after their election drubbing last year and subsequent slump in the polls. She has reportedly turned to Mrs T's legacy herself for inspiration, reading a book about her predecessor's early years in power. But the party has also been debating whether the Thatcherite era holds any lessons for Badenoch, as she faces the task of restoring her party's fortunes. 'Lanyard classes' Robert Colvile, who co-authored the Tories' 2019 election manifesto and now runs the Centre for Policy Studies think tank set up by Thatcher in the mid-1970s, says Badenoch today is facing a different economic backdrop. But speaking at a fringe event to mark the anniversary, he suggested she could draw from Thatcher when it comes to identifying the party's political targets. Whilst the former PM waged war with unions and state-backed industry, he said the Tories today should look to rein in the ""lanyard classes"" running government bodies ""constraining the growth of enterprise"". John Redwood, a former Tory MP who once headed up Thatcher's policy unit in Downing Street, said the British energy industry could provide a similar cause for the party's activists to rally behind. The sector, he added, had become ""like a nationalised industry"" due to the scale of public subsidies and ""bans and blocks"" to enforce net-zero targets. Getty Images Cardboard cut-outs of Margaret Thatcher are in evidence at the Tory conference Conservative MP Esther McVey told party members that Thatcher would be ""spinning in her grave"" at GB Energy, the new company set up by Labour to invest in green energy projects. McVey also argued that the party could take a leaf out of Thatcher's book when it comes to the task of rebuilding its reputation as a competent custodian of the British economy. It is perhaps the key message the party wants to get across this week, as it seeks to present Nigel Farage's spending plans as a threat to the public finance. McVey, a former work and pensions secretary, said Reform UK's promise to scrap the two-child benefit cap , a policy backed by the Lib Dems and also under consideration by Labour, could leave the Tories as the only main party pushing to keep the limit in place. ""The economy is where the Conservatives are going to get their breakthrough,"" she added. ""That is, I think, going to be our separation, our USP."" Redwood pointed out that Thatcher also faced an electoral challenge from a new party, in the shape of the SDP, which polled as high as 50% in the 1980s as part of an alliance with the Liberals. He added that the Tories didn't ""spend our time talking about or worrying about the social democrats,"" instead focusing on ""being Conservatives"". As the governing party at the time, he added, it was ""incumbent on us"" to show the party could deliver its policy programme. If Badenoch can repeat the trick in opposition, it could decide whether she can lead her party back into government.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c23755eg09zo,politics,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/e2a6/live/b61c2550-a1f6-11f0-947b-6b8b23372a50.jpg,2025-10-05T18:40:03.239000+00:00,98b76726681df634f30ad2c5dc516d5c032a598f

And in the end, it was former Apprentice star Thomas Skinner who left the show, after judges voted to save former England rugby captain Chris Robshaw. When asked by co-host Tess Daly about his experience on the show, Skinner, 34, paid tribute to his professional dance partner Amy Dowden. “Thank you, Amy - sorry that we haven't done too good, 'cause you're a different class,” he said. BBC/PA Skinner hit the headlines before the series had even started, after walking out of a press conference early - something he later apologised for . But the social media personality insisted he had ""loved"" his time on Strictly. ""I've never danced before and my stay was short, but Amy's amazing. It's been great fun and I've enjoyed it. I can't really dance that well but I've had fun!"" BBC/PA Thomas Skinner and Amy Dowden spoke about their experiences on the show after being defeated in the dance-off On Sunday night, both couples performed their routines from Saturday once again. Skinner and Dowden did their salsa to Bonkers by Dizzee Rascal and Armand van Helden, while Robshaw and his partner Nadiya Bychkova reprised their Viennese waltz to Die With A Smile by Lady Gaga and Bruno Mars. After the dances, the judges delivered their verdicts - and it was Robshaw and Bychkova who won the majority vote, leaving Skinner and Dowden to say their farewells. Dowden also complimented her dance partner, saying: ""I've got to know the real Tom, and he is adorable. He's looked after me. We've laughed so much."" BBC/PA During Saturday night's live show, Thomas Skinner bench-pressed his partner over his head Dowden has been candid about her wish to get back on the dance floor following her diagnosis with breast cancer two years ago. She made a return to Strictly in 2024 but had to pull out midway through the series due to an injury. Speaking on Saturday night, she said winning the glitterball would have been ""amazing"", but added: ""What I've learnt in the last few years is happiness, health and being alive is more important than anything."" Addressing Skinner, she went on to say: ""The last three years as you know have been quite difficult for me. I lost all confidence as a dancer - but walking into the room with you with a massive smile and a laugh, you brought me back and, honestly, thank you."" During Saturday night's live show , Skinner - sporting a clingy, sparkly vest top - hoisted Dowden up so often during their routine, judge Craig Revel Horwood joked it looked more like a weightlifting competition. They scored 13 points, placing them at the bottom of this week's leaderboard. Scores from week one and two were added to the public vote to decide which couples should face the dance-off. Skinner first hit TV screens on The Apprentice in 2019, and has since appeared on shows including 8 Out of 10 Cats, The Wheel, Michael McIntyre's Big Show, Good Morning Britain and Faking It, as well as Celebrity Masterchef.

0774091cfd34,Conservatives to set out plan for £47bn of cuts to public spending,,"Conservatives to set out plan for £47bn of cuts to public spending Kate Whannel Political reporter Getty Images The Conservatives will set out proposals later on cutting public spending on welfare, aid and civil servants which the shadow chancellor will say would save £47bn over five years. Sir Mel Stride is expected to say in his speech to the party's conference in Manchester that there is ""no more pretending we can keep spending money we simply do not have"". Proposals include stopping welfare claims for people with ""low level mental health problems"" and reducing the number of civil servants by around 132,000, a reduction of around a quarter. Sir Mel will also say his party would reduce aid spending by £7 billion to 0.1% of national income. The conference in Manchester marks almost one year since Kemi Badenoch was elected party leader. In the last 12 months, the party has struggled to counter the political threat posed by Reform UK and suffered heavy defeats in this year's local elections . During their conference, which began on Sunday, the Conservatives are hoping to portray themselves as more competent and more credible - particularly on public spending - than their political rivals. In his conference speech, Sir Mel will say: ""We must get on top of government spending. ""We cannot deliver stability unless we live within our means. ""We're the only party that gets it. The only party that will stand up for fiscal responsibility."" His proposals include saving: £23bn from the welfare bill £8bn by bringing civil servant numbers from 517,000 down to 2016 levels of 384,000 £7bn from the overseas aid budget £3.5bn by ending the use of hotels to home asylum seekers £4bn by ensuring benefits and social housing are reserved for UK nationals £1.6bn by scrapping environmental policies, including cutting subsidies for heat pumps and electric vehicles. Earlier this year, the Labour government sought to cut nearly £5bn from the disability and health-related benefits bill but had to backtrack after a rebellion by its own MPs. Work and Pensions Secretary Pat McFadden has suggested the government will return to the issue, telling the BBC that changes to the welfare system ""must happen"". Last year, the Office for Budget Responsibility forecast that total spending on health and disability benefits would rise from £64.7bn in 2023-24 to £100.7bn in 2029-30. The Tories argue they can reduce the bill by reviewing exemptions for the Household Benefit Cap, limiting the VAT subsidy for Motability - which allows claimants to lease vehicles - and changing obligations for job-seekers. It says it would stop claims for people suffering from ""low-level health"" mental health problems arguing that ""what is really needed is treatment and support, not cash"". It also says it would keep in place the two-child benefit cap, which prevents households on universal or child tax credit from receiving payments for a third or subsequent child born after April 2017. The Labour government has been under pressure to remove the cap, with many of its backbenchers arguing the limit has increased the number of children in poverty. The Resolution Foundation says axing the cap would lift 470,000 children out of poverty and would cost around £3.5bn. Badenoch has previously defended the cap saying it was a matter of ""fairness"" and Conservatives believed people on benefits ""should have to make the same choices on having children as everyone else"". Earlier this year, Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said he would cut the UK's aid budget from 0.5% of gross national income to 0.3% in 2027 in order to pay for an increase in defence spending. The Conservatives say further reducing spending to 0.1% would save nearly £7bn. Currently, a portion of the existing aid budget is used to pay for hotels to accommodate asylum seekers. The Institute for Economic Affairs (IEA) think tank welcomed some of the proposals but warned the Conservatives not to ignore ""elephant in the room"" of age-related spending such as pensions. Tom Clougherty, IEA executive director, said: ""Ultimately, no political party is going to be able to balance the books only by cutting things their supporters don't like. ""Without that, other cuts are likely to amount to running to stand still."" The Conservatives have not committed to changing the triple lock, which guarantees that the state pension will go up each year in line with either inflation, wage increases or 2.5% - whichever is the highest. Romilly Greenhill, chief executive of Bond, the network of international development organisations, said the proposed aid budget cuts were ""reckless, short-sighted, and morally indefensible"". The Conservative conference comes six weeks before Chancellor Rachel Reeves delivers her Budget on 26 November. During the election, Labour promised not to increase income tax, National Insurance or VAT for working people. However, there has been speculation that Reeves will need to raise taxes in order to meet her self-imposed rules for public spending and debt. In a report in March, the Office for Budget Responsibility said the chancellor only had a ""very small margin"" - £10bn buffer - in which to operate.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4gzv9j78dyo,politics,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/20e0/live/817a56d0-a22a-11f0-9a8d-55d7ff06f061.jpg,2025-10-05T21:33:42.878000+00:00,a504697dc7a2560b93555221ea46e7498603e01f
9cbd2a1269e7,Chris Mason: Why protests have started a debate over 'Britishness',,"Chris Mason: Why protests have started a debate over 'Britishness' Chris Mason Political editor EPA The Conservative Party conference in Manchester is taking place against a backdrop of grief and pain over last week's synagogue attack When a political party gathers for its annual conference, the host city (or at least the political and security bubble that surrounds the conference centre) becomes home to feverish and partisan political chat. What is different about the next few days is Manchester is also a city in mourning after the horrific attack on Thursday. There is, of course, still sharp political argument here but the emotional and practical backdrop is one of grief, fear and an ongoing police investigation. The flags outside the conference centre fly at half mast. A community just a few miles from here, but also all over the UK, is terrorised, frightened and grieving. Many Jewish people are furious more has not been done - for years - to protect them. And all this poses some of the biggest questions about who we are and what we hold dear. The other day the Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood pleaded with pro-Palestinian protesters not to head out onto the streets in the immediate days after the attack at the Heaton Park Synagogue. She argued that to do so would be ""un-British"". But others ponder just how British it is to curb repeated protests - the plan Mahmood now plans to legislate for. So what are the fundamental tenets of Britishness - a concept itself some would contest - under which a multicultural, multilingual, multireligious collection of nations such as the UK could agree on? Against the backdrop of pain and grief, this is a debate about some of the fundamentals of our society - democracy, protest, offence, tolerance (even tolerance for the intolerant) and proportionality. In addition to antisemitism, there is Islamophobia too. The home secretary talked over the weekend, rather euphemistically, about what she called ""community relations"" and others might put more baldly as racism and hatred. The Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch said the UK had tolerated what she called radical Islamist ideology ""for too long"". This element of the conversation around the dangers of Islamism and how it is countered is not new and itself infuriates many as we collectively wrestle with what to do about it. These are challenges for the home secretary, challenges for the government yes, but challenges for society as a whole.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c7840dv7n4po,politics,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/afef/live/acb32710-a279-11f0-b741-177e3e2c2fc7.jpg,2025-10-06T06:01:51.849000+00:00,8b1de4374fa1c138867b726cc803bb2403668971
3e586b23f634,Housebuying shake-up plan aims to cut costs and time,,"Housebuying shake-up plan aims to cut costs and time Charlotte Edwards Business reporter, BBC News Getty Images Plans for a major reform of the housebuying system, which aim to cut costs, reduce delays and halve failed sales, have been unveiled by the government. Housing Secretary Steve Reed said the changes would ""fix the broken system"" and put more money ""back into working people's pockets"". Under the new proposals, sellers and estate agents will be legally required to provide key information about a property up front. The overhaul could save first-time buyers an average of £710 and cut up to four weeks off the typical property transaction timeline, according to the government. It is estimated that hundreds of thousands of families and first-time buyers could benefit from the reforms. Those in the middle of a chain could also potentially gain a net saving of £400 as a result of the increased costs from selling being outweighed by lower buying expenses. The consultation draws on other jurisdictions, including the Scottish system where there is more upfront information and earlier binding contracts. This will include being up front about the condition of the home, any leasehold costs, and details of property chains. The government says this transparency will reduce the risk of deals collapsing late in the process and improve confidence among buyers, particularly those purchasing a home for the first time. Binding contracts may also be introduced to prevent parties from walking away late in the deal, a move intended to halve the number of failed transactions, which currently cost the UK economy an estimated £1.5bn a year. ""Buying a home should be a dream, not a nightmare,"" said Reed. ""Our reforms will fix the broken system so hardworking people can focus on the next chapter of their lives."" The reforms will also aim to boost professional standards across the housing sector. A new mandatory Code of Practice for estate agents and conveyancers is being proposed, along with the introduction of side-by-side performance data to help buyers choose trusted professionals based on expertise and track record. The government said a full roadmap for the changes would be published in the new year, forming part of its broader housing strategy, which includes a pledge to build 1.5 million new homes. Housing expert Kirstie Allsopp, the presenter of Channel 4's Location, Location, Location, told the BBC's Today programme she was ""really glad the government has grasped this nettle"". She said it was important to focus on both the buying and selling sides, ""because things fall through because buyers walk away just as much as sellers walk away, and I think that was a worrying element"". The boss of property website Rightmove, Johan Svanstrom, welcomed the plans to modernise the system. ""The home-moving process involves many fragmented parts, and there's simply too much uncertainty and costs along the way. Speed, connected data and stakeholder simplicity should be key goals."" However, Conservative shadow housing minister Paul Holmes said: ""Whilst we welcome steps to digitise and speed up the process, this risks reinventing the last Labour Government's failed Home Information Packs - which reduced the number of homes put on sale, and duplicated costs across buyers and sellers."" The announcement comes as the Conservatives are set to detail changes to its tax policy for first home buyers at the party's conference in Manchester. The party will lay out plans to ""reward work"" by giving young people a £5,000 tax rebate towards their first home when they get their first full time job. Shadow chancellor Mel Stride will announce proposals for a ""first-job bonus"" that would divert national insurance payments into a long-term savings account. The party say it will be funded by cuts to public spending worth £47bn over five years in areas such as welfare, the civil service and the foreign aid budget.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy0v7zwp0dlo,politics,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/0623/live/488de0c0-a226-11f0-a2b9-abdd67c14f44.jpg,2025-10-06T06:56:00.600000+00:00,e0465fcf99bf349beccba1418a655374bef4fdef
32ea352a35d5,Why time matters for Tory MPs deciding Kemi Badenoch's future,,"Why time matters for Tory MPs deciding Kemi Badenoch's future Matt Chorley 5 Live presenter PA Media Louis Armstrong had all of it in the world. The Beautiful South needed a little more. For Kemi Badenoch, and her 118 MPs, time is also on their minds. The Conservative leader believes she needs more time, to turn around her party from its historic drubbing in last year's general election. Yet as time's gone on, she's gone further down in the polls. ""I didn't say it would be easy,"" she told Tory members on Sunday. ""And I didn't say it would be quick."" For her MPs - and I've contacted almost all of them for my BBC Radio 5 Live show via text and WhatsApp over the last few days - time is of the essence, and for some, it is already running out. Around one in three Tory MPs responded to my questions about the mood of the party, and the pressure Badenoch is under. They break down roughly into two camps. In the first are those who think the next election is a considerable way off and want Badenoch to be given space to try to repair damage not all of her own making. The mood, they insist, is better than much of the media speculation. ""Chipper"", even. They take comfort from Labour's own woes and leadership speculation, and cling to a belief that Reform UK's populist policies increasingly do not survive contact with reality. ""There's a gallows humour about the party, a 'well it can't get any worse, can it?' strange jovialness which is kind of bonding,"" says one Tory MP. Several texts I received suggested Badenoch had bought herself more time in office, perhaps months, with a single performance at Prime Minister's Questions last month , when she challenged Keir Starmer over what he knew about the friendship between his US ambassador, Peter Mandelson, and convicted paedophile Jeffrey Epstein. One former cabinet minister said: ""The Mandelson PMQs was a turning point. She smashed it. ""That one half hour has probably bought her another six months of grace in the job. She doesn't need to learn the same lesson twice. Giving her time and space is starting to pay dividends."" And then there is the second camp who think the clock is ticking: on her leadership and on the long-term viability of what used to be called the world's oldest and most successful political party. They grumble, especially those elected for the first time last year, about a leader's office lacking in direction, fight, even a willingness to acknowledge their existence. ""It's not that we're not getting listened to as a party,"" says one 2024 Tory MP. ""It's that we've nothing to say. We're too timid, we think we're in government still and are fretting about costing things that we'll never have to worry about if we keep on launching commissions and our best pushback against Reform is 'That's not costed, you know'."" In recent weeks, stung by criticism that she was aloof from her MPs, Badenoch has begun inviting in small groups for lunch. Well, platters of shop-bought sandwiches. When I pointed out to one invitee that Badenoch famously declared last year that she hated sandwiches (in line with just 1% of the British public), they replied ""oh no, the MPs had sandwiches, Kemi had something hot brought in"". Some tell me privately that the looming date of 2 November, when Badenoch will have been in office for a year and therefore open to a confidence vote, is ""focusing minds"" in the leader's office. ""She needs to have a very impactful conference in order to stave off a confidence vote before the end of the year in my view,"" says one MP. ""There's a whiff of fatality in the air because of the polls."" So how much time does she have? Next year's elections to the Scottish Parliament, Welsh Senedd and many English councils are shaping up to be ""the moment of truth"", according to some of her MPs. (Labour MPs were saying similar things to me about Keir Starmer last week.) One member of Badenoch's own frontbench, who closely monitors the mood of the party, texts me bluntly: ""She is under unbelievable pressure. This will be her last conference as leader."" When I expressed some surprise at the prediction, the MP quickly responded: ""I like Kemi and I think we should stick with the leader we have so I hope I'm completely wrong."" Others are more convinced that her time is running out. One Conservative who publicly backed Badenoch in last year's leadership contest told me: ""Kemi's time as leader could end by Christmas rather than after the May elections. ""Ultimately unpredictable, and how conference goes will shape the outcome, but conference, and post conference polls, are undoubtedly pivotal."" Whatever the merits of having someone different in charge – and many see Robert Jenrick waiting in the wings – it risks exposing the Tories once again to the most damaging of political forces: ridicule. One grandee tells me: ""We need to regain our senses and remember we were totally thrashed last summer and have not yet been forgiven. More shenanigans won't help."" A shadow minister agrees: ""This conference is super important. People and members want direction and messaging and so this is Kemi's moment. She can't squander it - she needs to show why we are the sensible option on the right and a genuine force still. ""If she doesn't deliver it could be curtains but most MPs I speak to want this to work. There is too much PTSD from the last five years."" A former cabinet minister says: ""The Tories will start to make progress - and it will be on the economy – after enough time has passed since our crushing defeat and the public feel enough water under the bridge since that defeat."" Another says: ""When the country is ready to listen to us again (a year hence maybe?), we'll show that we are totally unified, have some great people and the right ideas."" One MP who has been in the Commons for two decades says: ""No one is expecting instant miracles nor is there urgent appetite for a coup."" PA Media Kemi Badenoch defeated rivals Robert Jenrick, James Cleverly and Tom Tugendhat in the 2024 leadership election in Birmingham Some note that she is very much the new kid on the block: Farage has been an elected politician on and off for more than quarter of a century. Starmer has been leader for almost six years. Even Sir Ed Davey, the Lib Dem leader, was a minister in the coalition government 15 years ago. Being unknown means voters struggle to work out what she is about, but it also presents an opportunity to move beyond the last Tory government and appear new and fresh. Talk continues about what to do about Reform. Will some sort of deal have to be made? A merger? A pact? A takeover? Whatever, the Tories need to be in a stronger position before it can think about such a negotiation. There is also a theory that's taken hold in Conservative thinking that part of their predicament is the fault of Keir Starmer. ""Usually the opposition would have longer but the government collapse in popularity has happened so quickly it has sharpened focus on needing to have an alternative narrative,"" one Tory MP, first elected in 2024, said. ""It is hard to look like a renewed party though when so many of the key people are well known from the last government when it was comprehensively dumped from power."" Some declare her party conference pledge to repeal the Climate Change Act a ""gamechanger"". Others say the same of a promise to leave the European Convention on Human Rights. What is not always clear is if they actually expect it to change the game, or merely hope it might. Badenoch and her team are being urged to ""quickly set out a bold, uncompromisingly honest, radical 'Maggie 2.0' program of reform, on tax, small business, immigration and welfare, to tackle the grievances Farage is feeding on"". EPA Three display cabinets at Conservative party conference holding outfits worn by Margaret Thatcher Ah yes, Maggie. Margaret Thatcher. She would have turned 100 this month, but the former prime minister still haunts this conference and this party. Sir Iain Duncan Smith, who took over as leader of the Conservatives after their 2001 election defeat before being ousted two years later, told me: ""I think it's a very difficult time for anyone to be leader. ""The Conservative party has a messiah complex, thinking some messiah will suddenly appear and lead us to the promised land. ""They look back to Margaret Thatcher and think she arrived as a fully-formed messiah to save the party and the country. In fact, when she arrived some people thought 'this is a disaster'. People said she was shrill, weak, difficult. It took her time for her strength of character and intellect to dominate and for her to become the leader she was. ""Kemi has that capability and needs time too. Otherwise we risk confirming people's view of us from our behaviour during the last government that we are fratricidal and not to be trusted."" In the conference exhibition hall in Manchester there is a lot of Thatcher merchandise - and a glass display case holding the burgundy wool suit she wore on the day she left Downing Street - a monument to the moment a female Tory leader was ousted by her colleagues because they believed she was doing more harm than good. After this conference week in Manchester we might have a clearer idea if Tory MPs are ready to do that particular Time Warp again.

5b7d80f55b23,Eastenders' Kellie Bright on the challenges of being a Send parent,,"Eastenders' Kellie Bright on the challenges of being a Send parent Kellie Bright Presenter, BBC Panorama Kellie Bright I've been desperate to make a documentary about special educational needs and disabilities (Send) for ages. You might know me as EastEnders' Linda Carter but I'm also a mum to my autistic son. He's also dyslexic and has ADHD. It took months of perseverance and hard work from my husband and I to try to get the right education for him. At times, it felt like a battle. That is why I wanted to make this film for Panorama, so I could meet other families who were going through the same thing, and speak to teachers, councils and the government about how Send children are educated in England. There are more than 1.7 million children in England with Send. It is a broad group, including autistic children and people who struggle with speech and language, have ADHD and physical disabilities, among other conditions. Schools in England already provide some support to these students but if parents think their child needs extra help they can make an application to their council for what's called an Education, Health and Care Plan (EHCP). An EHCP is a crucial document because it is legally binding, states where a child should go to school and outlines how much extra support they should get. My husband and I spent hours filling in the forms to request an EHCP and many families find the process very frustrating. Buddy and Tunde Not long after I meet 15-year-old Buddy, he shows me his favourite cuddly toy, Reindeer Dog. Buddy's autistic, meaning his brain experiences and reacts to the world in a different way from many people's. He struggles with meeting people his own age, understanding his emotions and anxiety. Buddy likes to keep Reindeer Dog close to him. After moving to London from Scotland in October 2024, Buddy's mum, Tunde, started applying for schools. She says she tried at least 11 schools but many of them didn't get back to her, and those that did said they were full or could not give Buddy extra support without an EHCP. At the start of this year more than 638,000 EHCPs had been issued to children and young people in England, a 10.8% rise on the year before and an 80% increase in six years. The increase is partly because parents and schools have got better at identifying children who have special educational needs, especially autism, as opposed to there being more children with Send. It is the second time Buddy and Tunde have applied for an EHCP. Their first application was turned down before Buddy was assessed. Councils reject about a quarter of EHCP applications at the assessment stage, according to the Department for Education. When they lived in Scotland, Tunde says they did not have to apply for the equivalent of an EHCP. Buddy's comprehensive school arranged support for his learning, although not for his emotional needs. Scotland has a different system for helping children with Send; schools there aim to deliver more support without the need for parents to apply for the equivalent of an EHCP. ""It's a madness,"" Tunde says. ""[Getting extra support] was so easily done, and it could be easily done again."" While Buddy is not able to go to school, the council is providing him with 19 hours of lessons per week in the local library. Tunde tells me the process of applying for an EHCP has been so time consuming she had to stop working as a midwife and health visitor for a time. ""I can't do the parenting. I can't get him to these appointments, and work at the same time… I couldn't get my son seen in the right amount of time and see other people's babies in the right amount time. And it was a toss up - and my son won,"" she says. We catch up with Buddy after a lengthy speech and language assessment. ""Draining… that's all I've got for you,"" he says as he leans against a fence, Reindeer Dog tucked under his arm. Buddy often takes Reindeer Dog to give him comfort A school for Buddy It's September and as millions of children start term, Buddy is still being taught in the library. Two months after I first met him, he's getting an EHCP but his education is still not settled. The council agreed to Tunde's request that he go to an independently run school that works with children who struggle in mainstream schools. Before Buddy can start there, the school has already taken over the lessons he receives in the library. But Tunde's now not sure the school will be able to deliver what she believes her son needs to improve his social skills and confidence with children his own age. ""We were all prepared for September… and he's still not at school, he's still having one-to-one,"" she said. ""I think … preparing to be around other kids and then still just being one-to-one with adults has really knocked him back and made him not want to go to school."" Southwark Council says it takes Tunde's concerns very seriously and it will continue to support her family to ensure they receive the provision they need without further delay. It says it knows how hard it can be for families to navigate the system, and how distressing delays in securing support can be. It says it has invested in a specialist information and advice team, and now ensures children are assessed by specialist teachers at the earliest stage, and it is open to reviewing the situation when parents are concerned about education placements. 'The current system is broken' I know there is another side to this story. The huge rise in the number of EHCPs is putting councils under severe financial pressure. It is estimated by the Department for Education that English councils are set to run up a total accumulated Send deficit between £4.3bn and £4.9bn by March 2026. The government says it has invested a billion pounds to help councils pay for EHCPs and £740m on new Send school places . I went to West Sussex County Council to interview one of few people in local government prepared to talk to me on the record about Send funding. Jacquie Russell is a Conservative councillor and cabinet member for children, young people and learning. ""The current system is actually very adversarial. Our parents are increasingly tired and anxious and fed up of fighting… Staff sickness levels are really, really high at the moment,"" she says. ""The current system doesn't work. It is broken. It's not delivering the best outcomes for children."" Jacquie Russell says the current Send system is putting unsustainable pressure on councils Demand for EHCPs is now outstripping funding in West Sussex. In 2015, the council had about 3,400 children with an EHCP. Today there are more than 10,000. As a result the Send deficit has been growing year-on-year, so that at the end of 2025 it stands at more than £123m. ""That [money] is really essentially meant to be for local services. That would have ordinarily gone to repair your roads… and other local services,"" she says. ""The current position is not sustainable."" The government agrees. It is planning major reforms of the Send system, though final plans have not yet been agreed. The minister for school standards, Georgia Gould, told me the upcoming reforms were ""not taking support away from families"". ""We're wanting to put more support in earlier,"" she said. ""Where people have fought for support, and that's in place, we want to make sure that that support continues."" She also told me she wanted to work with parents to get the reforms right and to get support at the ""earliest possible point rather than having to battle"". The minister added that parents would still have a ""legal basis"" to get support. Worried parents held a rally in Westminster last month as the government mulls over reforms to the system For me, and thousands of other parents of Send children, applying for an EHCP feels like a battle about your child's future. Who does not want the best possible education for their son or daughter? But for every parent fighting, there is a council counting the cost. All eyes are now on the government to see if its reforms can relieve the pressure on so many families.

6fc00651c5d4,Best-selling author Jilly Cooper dies at 88,,"Best-selling author Jilly Cooper dies at 88 PA Media Novelist Dame Jilly Cooper, known for her best-selling books including Rivals and Riders, has died at the age of 88. Dame Jilly's most successful works were The Rutshire Chronicles, beginning with Riders in 1985, which portrayed the scandals, sex lives and social circles of the wealthy country set. Follow-up Rivals was published in 1988 and was turned into a hit Disney+ TV series last year. She sold more than 11 million books in total in the UK alone. In a statement, her children Felix and Emily said: ""Mum was the shining light in all of our lives. Her love for all of her family and friends knew no bounds. Her unexpected death has come as a complete shock."" 'Bonkbusters with insight' They added: ""We are so proud of everything she achieved in her life and can't begin to imagine life without her infectious smile and laughter all around us."" She died on Sunday morning after a fall, a statement from her publisher said. Her agent Felicity Blunt remeberend the writer as ""emotionally intelligent, fantastically generous, sharply observant and utter fun"". Blunt added: ""You wouldn't expect books categorised as bonkbusters to have so emphatically stood the test of time but Jilly wrote with acuity and insight about all things - class, sex, marriage, rivalry, grief and fertility. ""Her plots were both intricate and gutsy, spiked with sharp observations and wicked humour.

4e8a22849de3,Dame Jilly Cooper: Undisputed queen of the joyous British bonkbuster,,"Dame Jilly Cooper: Undisputed queen of the joyous British bonkbuster Getty Images Fans bought Cooper's books in their millions, pushing many to the top of the bestseller lists The novels of Dame Jilly Cooper, who has died at the age of 88, are joyous descriptions of a fantasy world where monied men cast smouldering glances and women are instantly aroused. The undisputed queen of the British bonkbuster, some of her biggest titles were the Rutshire Chronicles: unputdownable tales of sexual intrigue among the polo-playing classes - including such classics as Rivals, Riders and The Man Who Made Husbands Jealous. In Rutshire - Cooper's fictional country - everyone drinks like they have hours to live, outdoor sex is practically compulsory, and few vows of marriage survive until the final page. In recent years, her work was criticised for outdated stereotypes of race, gender and sexual consent. But fans bought Cooper's books in their millions, pushing many to the top of the bestseller lists. And in 2024, a Disney+ adaptation of Rivals, with its witty mixture of class-conflict, saucy sex and gentle social satire, proved that her basic recipe was still hugely popular. 'Shrewd and tough': A look back at Jilly Cooper's career Jilly Sallitt was born on 21 February 1937 in Hornchurch, Essex, although her parents came from old established Yorkshire families. Her father was Brigadier WB Sallitt OBE, a veteran of Dunkirk and surely a model for Cooper's fictional male characters. ""I adored my very handsome father,"" she said, ""who got a first at Cambridge, and also played rugger for both Cambridge and the army."" Her mother, Mary Sallitt was a noted beauty. Cooper, who described herself as ""rather plump"" as a teenager, worried about disappointing her. Getty Images Jilly Cooper said she spent far too much time ""longing for boys"" at school The family returned to Yorkshire, where young Jilly was educated at the Moorfield School in Ilkley. There she first met her future husband, Leo Cooper, when she was eight and he was three years older. ""My first memory of Leo,"" she recalled, ""was looking out of my bedroom window in Ilkley and seeing him throw a strawberry jelly at a girl who was rabbiting on about how much land her father had. I thought that terribly stylish."" She went on to the all-girls Godolphin School in Salisbury where she excelled at English and little else. On her own admission, she spent far too much time ""longing for boys"". Her family moved to London in the mid-1950s and, having failed to get the qualifications necessary to go to university, she embarked on a career as a journalist. She began working as a junior reporter on the Middlesex Independent, where she covered everything - including the local football team. Getty Images Jilly and Leo Cooper adopted two children: Felix and Emily However, she was unable to settle. She was sacked from 20 jobs, including stints in public relations and work as a copywriter - before finally working in publishing. She met up again with ""strong and handsome"" Leo Cooper, then working as a publisher of military books. On their first date, he ""unpinned my hair and told me I must never put my hair up again. And then he asked me to marry him."" Having experienced what reads like a scene from her own novels, Jilly did just that. She walked down the aisle with Leo in 1961. Getty Images Jilly Cooper photographed at home, surrounded by dogs Unable to have children of their own, Jilly and Leo adopted Emily and Felix. They set up home in Putney and struggled for money until 1968 - when Cooper got her big break. Over dinner with a Sunday Times magazine editor, Godrey Smith, she entertained him with bawdy tales of life as a hard-drinking, sexually liberated housewife. She was asked to write a piece for the newspaper, and the result had all the Jilly Cooper trademarks. It was totally outrageous, very funny and she was soon a regular contributor. A year later, the column became a book: How to Stay Married - which was full of now dated advice, including such pearls of wisdom as ""if you amuse a man in bed, he's not likely to bother about the mountain of dust underneath it"". In 1970, she wrote a follow-up: How to Survive from Nine to Five. Thereafter, Cooper averaged around a book a year. Getty Images Jilly Cooper published books about how to navigate the minefields of romance, before trying her hand a fiction She also created a TV sitcom, It's Awfully Bad For Your Eyes Darling. It starred Joanna Lumley and aired on the BBC in 1971. During the 13 years she worked for the Sunday Times, she also did serious interviews with a number of high profile figures including Margaret Thatcher, George Best and Rebecca West. And the 1970s saw her publish a flurry of books aimed at helping readers navigate the minefields of romance, including Men and Super Men, Woman and Superwomen, and Work & Wedlock. Then in 1975, she began to dabble in fiction. Her first novel was Emily - a romance based on a magazine article she'd written some years before. A rich, handsome man sweeps the heroine off her feet and bears her away to his ancestral home on a Scottish island - where she has to cope with his eccentric mother and a mysterious former flame. Flatteringly, Harpers & Queen magazine hailed Cooper as the ""Jane Austen of our time"" - although Pride and Prejudice has rather fewer descriptions of lusty sex in improbable places. Getty Images Jilly Cooper's social circle included the future Queen Camilla Emily was followed by a slew of page-turners in similar, breathy vein: Bella, Harriet, Imogen and Prudence. Octavia, in which a gushing party girl falls instantly in love with a blond, sharp-cheeked beau called Jeremy, later became an ITV series. In 1979, Cooper wrote Class: A View from Middle England: a cheerful examination of the intricacies of the system that both holds the country together, and simultaneously divides it. Describing herself as ""upper-middle class"", she tells a variety of real-life anecdotes - including the story of an imperious member of the House of Lords who, having just missed his train, commanded the station master to ""get me another"". Class was becoming a theme that permeated both her fiction and non-fiction. And Cooper's social circle now included some very upper class people indeed. Famously, these included Andrew and Camilla Parker-Bowles, who later - of course - became Queen. ""The first time I met her I wore a miniskirt and fishnet stockings,"" Cooper recalled. ""She looked me up and down and said, 'Oh, Andrew had 35 Valentines' this year.' Keep off the grass."" Getty Images Leo and Jilly Cooper photographed in 2004 Over the ensuing five years, her output was prodigious. There were more self-help books, including How to Survive Christmas, and The Common Years: a brilliantly observed look at the time when she lived by and walked on Putney Common. Animals in War was a poignant account of dogs, horses and pigeons that have served and suffered in various conflicts. In 1985, she published Riders: the first of the Rutshire Chronicles. Cooper had left the original manuscript on a London bus, and it had taken her a decade to rewrite it - but it became an international bestseller. Set amid the world of international showjumping, it introduced her hero: Rupert Campbell-Black - a brutish cad who treats women and horses cruelly, before mellowing slightly through the influence of his second wife, Taggie O'Hara. Getty Images Jilly Cooper became a Dame of the British Empire in 2024 Over the ensuing four decades, she published around a dozen Rutshire novels, including Rivals, Polo, Appassionata and Pandora. The Man Who Made Husbands Jealous, about a womaniser who falls victim to a scheme to punish wayward husbands, later became an ITV miniseries starring Hugh Bonneville. Jilly Cooper knew how to keep her reader hooked, weaving together a bewildering variety of characters and constantly switching the narrative. Having spent a lifetime writing about infidelity, she then felt the sting of adultery. In 1990, publisher Sarah Johnson told a newspaper that she and Leo had been having an affair for six years. The revelation was prompted, she said, by Jilly's habit of boasting in print about her perfect marriage. For a while, Jilly and Leo lived semi-separate lives. But, eventually, they reconciled. Getty Images Dame Jilly Cooper surrounded by members of the cast of Disney+'s adaptation of Rivals in 2024 In 1999, she narrowly escaped death in the Ladbroke Grove train crash. With 31 deaths and more than 400 injured, it was one of the worst accidents in the history of British transport. But, having crawled through a broken carriage window, Cooper calmly walked to the nearest street, hailed a taxi, and went to a pre-arranged meeting at the Ritz. In 2004, Jilly Cooper was awarded an OBE. Twenty years later, Buckingham Palace was in touch again - asking her to become a Dame. After Leo's death from Parkinson's disease, she faced life alone. But, fast approaching 90, she was still publishing. In 2023, Tackle! - the latest installation of the Rutshire Chronicles - found Rupert Campbell-Black taking control of the local football team despite hating the sport. While promoting the book, Dame Jilly lavished alcohol and peerless quotes on any journalist that ventured to her home in Gloucestershire. A year later, Disney+'s glossy TV adaption of Rivals brought her a new generation of fans. Even the then Prime Minister Rishi Sunak admitted he counted himself amongst them . Dame Jilly seemed to find as much fun in her books as her readers did. ""They're a bit of everything really,"" she once said. ""And happy endings too.""

The 39-year-old, from Llandaff in Cardiff, has previously claimed she was hacked by the now-defunct News Of The World newspaper at the age of 16, which ultimately led to an apology from publishers News Group Newspapers and the award of substantial damages to the young star. The singer, who earned the moniker the Voice of an Angel at the height of her fame, said that reading media coverage at the time ""felt like a knife to the skin"". ""The press intrusion was insane, there was all sorts of dark stuff going on,"" said Church, who joins the line-up on BBC One's Celebrity Traitors this Wednesday. Speaking to The Big Issue, the singer and presenter - who first rose to fame at the age of 11 - said: ""I know a lot of teenagers feel like things are unfair, but the sense of injustice I had was so keen. ""There were stories in the papers all the time and lots of things were blown up, misconstrued and made seedy - when they really weren't. ""There was a lot of shame being thrown at me, with the press desperately trying to make me a figure of sin and push this 'fallen angel' narrative,"" added Church, who now runs a wellness retreat in Powys. Getty Images Charlotte Church and Gavin Henson were dubbed 'the Welsh Posh and Becks' In 2005, the Crazy Chick singer - who had embarked on a career in pop - became involved with Wales international rugby player Gavin Henson, a relationship which drew a lot of media attention - with the couple christened 'the Welsh Posh and Becks'. The pair went on to have two children but split in 2010, weeks after announcing their engagement. During a high-profile legal battle, which was eventually settled in 2012, it was revealed Church had been put under surveillance by News Group Newspaper journalists and her medical records had been hacked. Church said her fury and defiance at the situation helped her survive the media scrutiny and coverage, and ""kept me protected"".

02bc67919989,Green Party backs plan to see end of private letting,,"The Green Party has committed itself to phasing out private landlords from the housing system. A motion passed at its party conference at the weekend called for the party ""to seek the effective abolition of private landlordism"" while backing building more council houses. The plan is now official policy for the Green Party of England and Wales, but there are currently no costings for the plans. In England, 19% of all households live in privately rented properties according to the latest government figures, making it the second largest type of housing. In Wales, the latest available figure is 17%. Under the terms of their new policy, the Greens would put more regulation and taxes on private rentals to make it difficult for landlords to make a profit, while boosting housebuilding by councils. It would use existing Green policies such as imposing rent controls, ending buy-to-let mortgages and giving councils the 'right to buy' a rental property when it is sold at a discounted price. The Greens would set up a state-owned housing manufacturer ""to mass produce high quality mass council housing for local authorities"". They would also levy national insurance on rental income, which, according to a report in The Times , is a measure that has also been considered by the Chancellor Rachel Reeves. Green MP Carla Denyer, who is the party's housing spokesperson, suggested the policy was not as a radical as it might sound. ""While the motion to conference had an eye-catching name, it does not actually 'abolish' landlords,"" she said. ""It does, however, address the housing crisis, empowers tenants and improves their wellbeing. It contains a range of policies which, over time, would reduce the proportion of the housing market that is privately rented, and increase the proportion of socially rented homes."" Under the Greens' rules, motions like this, which was put forward by an activist, become party policy if they pass a vote at either of the two conferences it holds each year. Other new policies adopted over the weekend included protecting people who have been in care from discrimination by calling for ""care experience"" to be treated in the same way as age, sex or religious belief under The Equality Act. Ellie Chowns, the Greens' Leader in Parliament, said the party's MPs would now push the government to adopt the measure. She said that ""those who have been in care often face discrimination, harassment and victimisation throughout their lives, in housing, education, health, employment and the justice system"". She added: ""Making care experience a protected characteristic would ensure public bodies make policy with care-experienced people in mind.""

9a9628abc7e5,Kogan appointed chair of football regulator,,"In April Nandy said Kogan was the ""outstanding candidate"" to fill the position, despite not being on the original three-person shortlist. A spokesperson for the Department of Culture, Media and Sport told BBC Sport: ""The Culture, Media and Sport Select Committee found David Kogan appointable after his scrutiny hearing and we are now pleased to proceed in announcing him as chair. ""It is vital that the work to set up the regulator continues at pace to strengthen the governance of the national game and for that we need a chair in post and a board put in place. ""We have co-operated fully with the inquiry by the Commissioner of Public Appointments and await the report's publication."" In May Kogan told MPs on the Culture, Media and Sport Committee (CMS) during a pre-appointment hearing that he was being ""utterly transparent"" by declaring his donations. The committee endorsed Kogan but said he must work to ""reassure the football community that he will act impartially and in a politically neutral way"". Committee chair Dame Caroline Dinenage warned that Kogan's ""past donations to the Labour Party will inevitably leave him open to charges of political bias in a job where independence is paramount"". Kogan said he had donated ""very small sums"" to the campaigns, as well as thousands of pounds to Labour MPs and candidates in recent years, but had ""total personal independence from all of them"" and pledged ""total political impartiality"" if appointed. However, his proposed appointment was criticised by the Conservative Party, with  Shadow Culture Minister Stuart Andrew saying it was ""Labour cronyism"". ""The public has a right to know whether this was a fair and impartial process, or yet another case of political patronage disguised as due diligence,"" he said. Kogan, who will be paid a Â£130,000 salary for a three-day week, has been appointed for a five-year term until 19 May 2030. Dame Helen Stephenson and Simon Levine have also been appointed to the board. One of Kogan's biggest priorities is expected to be Sheffield Wednesday. Last month Nandy warned owner Dejphon Chansiri that ""change is coming"" amid continued calls for the Thai businessman to sell the cash-strapped Championship club. Various embargoes have been placed on the club for tax debts and late payments to players and staff. Last week it was revealed that player and staff wages were again not paid on time for the fifth time in seven months. Nandy said that ""if necessary, the football regulator can intervene in order to remove an owner who is threatening the future of the club"".

The documentary series follows his real-life car restoration venture, The Smallest Cog, in Herefordshire. Hammond, from Solihull, said he knew about cars, drove them round race tracks and had run production firms, but when it came to managing the workshop, he said: ""I'm outside my comfort zone"". Describing his mother as ""terrifying"", he said: ""I couldn't get the lads to fill in their timesheets which I absolutely need…and I just couldn't get them to do it - so I brought her in. She's only tiny but she did [it], they listened to her, so they do it now."" Key moments in the series, which premieres on Discovery+ later, include painting an Aston Martin pink, after a request by the customer, racing a classic 1960s sports car at Silverstone , and repairing a Mercedes SL given to Debbie McGee by her celebrity magician husband Paul Daniels. Hammond said each car came with a great story, whether it was a multi-million pound Ferrari or an old Ford Escort, because each one had someone's dreams or memories wrapped up in it. Motor trade 'in my blood' The business began four or five years ago, he said, after he had worked as a broadcaster talking about cars for 30 years, but wanted to be part of the industry. He described the motor trade as being "" in my blood "", because his grandfather was a coachbuilder at Mulliners Ltd in Birmingham and finished his career as an inspector at the end of the Jensen Interceptor line in West Bromwich. ""I thought, 'Well, I'm going to set up this workshop, I'll do it in near home and I'll put some blokes in it and brilliant, now I'm part of the industry, good', and then I thought that might make a good telly show."" The key thing was it was a real business, he said, adding: ""These are people's jobs. The guys working for me are painters, welders, fabricators, mechanics. ""This is their job. They pay rent and mortgage from the money, so I can't just go, 'Now I've had enough, let's just fold it', because it's their jobs so I've got to make it work.""",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c1jz4wxk6y3o,entertainment,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/0e24/live/f52af9a0-a2b5-11f0-92db-77261a15b9d2.jpg,2025-10-06T13:57:19.788000+00:00,0647dde3f8c761c3a161529ba7f0f580fb329555
85e26dcc31af,No 10 denies government involved in collapse of China spying case,,"No 10 denies government involved in collapse of China spying case Becky Morton Political reporter and Jack Fenwick Political correspondent AFP/Getty Images Christopher Cash (left) and Christopher Berry (right) were both accused of being Chinese spies Downing Street has strongly denied the government was involved in the collapse of a prosecution against two men accused of spying for China. Charges against Christopher Cash and Christopher Berry - who both deny the allegations - were dropped by prosecutors in September , prompting criticism from ministers and MPs. Number 10's press secretary said ""the suggestion that the government withheld evidence, withdrew witnesses or restricted the ability of a witness to draw on a particular bit of evidence are all untrue"". It comes after the Sunday Times reported senior Whitehall officials met to discuss the trial early last month before the charges were dropped. Mr Cash, a former parliamentary researcher, and Mr Berry, were charged under the Official Secrets Act in April 2024, when the Conservatives were in power. They were accused of gathering and providing information prejudicial to the safety and interests of the state between December 2021 and February 2023. Several sources close to the trial have told the BBC that the CPS would not have made the decision to charge the pair unless it was confident that it had enough evidence to meet the threshold set in the Act. Under the Official Secrets Act, anyone accused of spying can only be prosecuted if the information they passed on was useful to an enemy. However, last month the director of public prosecutions, Stephen Parkinson, who leads the CPS, said ""the case could no longer proceed to trial since the evidence no longer met the evidential test"". The prime minister's official spokesman said the decision was made by the CPS ""entirely independently of government"" and there was ""no role for any government minister or member of the government in this decision-making process"". He added that the government was ""disappointed"" that the prosecution had not proceeded. Mr Parkinson has also insisted no ""outside pressure"" played a part in the CPS decision. The Sunday Times reported that in a meeting last month, national security adviser Jonathan Powell revealed the government's evidence would be based on the national security strategy, which was published in June and does not refer to China as an ""enemy"". Asked if there had been a meeting in Whitehall in which Mr Powell had said China could not be called an enemy in court, the PM's spokesman said ""no"". He said the government's evidence in the case was ""based on the previous government's policy that was relevant at the time that the alleged offences took place between 2021 and 2023"". The position of the Conservative government at the time was to describe China as an ""epoch-defining challenge"", not an enemy. Getty Images Conservative MP Alicia Kearns previously employed Christopher Cash as a parliamentary researcher The decision to drop charges against the pair has been criticised by MPs, including Commons Speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle who said it could leave Parliament vulnerable to espionage. Conservative MP Alicia Kearns, who previously employed Mr Cash as a parliamentary researcher, said it was ""inexplicable"" that the trial would have collapsed ""without either ministerial or national security advisor or executive involvement"". ""I have no question that the Crown Prosecution Service made this decision independently,"" she told BBC Radio 4's Today programme earlier. ""However, it seems very clear to me that their ability to prosecute was spiked."" ""The evidential standard was met when charges were laid and something has happened, and I'm afraid it happened in the last few weeks before the trial was meant to go to court, where something changed, where the evidential standard was no longer met because something was withdrawn,"" she said. ""That can only happen if a witness was withdrawn, evidence was withdrawn, or the intelligence on which an officer of the state was expecting to operate was withdrawn... ""Either ministers or senior advisors acted with [Keir] Starmer's full knowledge, or they acted in contradiction and contempt of his wishes in a way that spiked the CPS's ability to prosecute."" Kearns, who has been a vocal critic of China, said she was concerned the government was ""putting our national security second"" because it wanted to reset relations with Beijing. In October 2024 David Lammy became only the second foreign secretary in six years to visit China , where he said Beijing and London should ""find pragmatic solutions to complex challenges"".

074254cd4834,Bleak reality of opposition sets in for Conservatives,,"Before us, there is a battalion of unemployed chairs. For the Conservatives right now, the fight even to be listened to is not easy. The speech by the shadow chancellor Sir Mel Stride is one of the big set-piece moments of this conference. And yet there were countless empty seats in a modestly sized hall. Next door, in the exhibition centre, there are swathes of empty blue carpet. Some of the fringe events exploring the party's future have been standing room only. But not in the main hall. This party, so often and for so long the dominating force in British politics, is a shrivelled version of its usual self. They have not had a conference like this in more than a quarter of a century. Granted, they were in opposition this time last year too. But many attendees then will have signed up before they knew about that – the general election could have come after it. Plus, 12 months ago, there was a survivors' elation vibe about their proceedings: a leadership election was underway and members of any political party tend to revel in a battle of ideas and personalities, almost whatever the circumstances. This year, the bleak reality of opposition has set in. Even back in 1998, a year and a bit into their last big stint in opposition, they were the principal voice in opposition to a big majority government. Not so now. A year and a bit on from a cataclysmic election defeat, the Tories have become more unpopular. It is Reform UK that have momentum, a sustained lead in the opinion polls and a recent track record of election victories, albeit a very long way away from a general election. In the weeks prior to the Conservatives gathering in Manchester, there has been a steady drip drip of former Tories joining Nigel Farage, some with the parting rhetorical gift of claiming their old party is finished. It is not an entirely downcast mood here though. Perhaps by definition those who have turned up are still up for the scrap ahead. The party has decided to embark on a blitz of policy announcements, after a year in which they have endured a recession in attention amid the boom in interest in Reform. What they want you to notice is their pitch to be seen as economically credible. They want to shrink the state by around £50bn by cutting benefits, cutting foreign aid and cutting the civil service. Most of that money saved would be spent paying down the deficit, but some would go on eye-catching policies like scrapping business rates in England and helping young people save to buy a home . Yet the ghost of Liz Truss lingers: despite their best efforts to politely disown her, the Conservatives' opponents will probably never lose their appetite for reminding voters of the calamity of her brief premiership . And for Kemi Badenoch, the challenge is being noticed – and persuading her party to keep her in her job. Her rivals, Sir Keir Starmer, Reform leader Nigel Farage and the Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey have all been around for longer and are all likely better known. Filling those empty chairs, commanding attention is just the beginning of the task she confronts. Has there ever been a tougher time in modern history for the Conservative Party? I'm not sure there has.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c62ne9yz37go,politics,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/2135/live/4ff6b170-a2d0-11f0-928c-71dbb8619e94.jpg,2025-10-06T16:25:19.948000+00:00,bcb9d3ab92f89df1475051214b94c462e3bfe026

That marks Swift's biggest sales week ever, and the second-largest sales week for any album since 1991, when modern chart methodology began. Only Adele's 25 has done better - selling 3.378 million copies in its first week in 2015. The Life of a Showgirl has also smashed the US record for the most vinyl albums sold in a single week. Swifties snapped up 1.2 million copies on wax - at least in part because the star released eight collectable variants of the record. The previous single-week record was also set by Swift when her last album, The Tortured Poets Department, sold 859,000 copies on vinyl in its first week. Getty Images The album captures the blossoming romance between Swift and Travis Kelce - who announced their engagement last month Swift's sales figures are all the more impressive because album sales elsewhere in the industry are in a state of perpetual decline. In the UK, only one other album has shifted more than 100,000 copies in a week this year - Sam Fender's People Watching. Ed Sheeran's latest, Play, sold 67,000 units when it came out last month. During the summer, two albums (Reneé Rapp's Bite Me and the Oasis compilation Time Flies) topped the charts with fewer than 20,000 sales. Not content with chart domination, however, Swift topped the cinema box office this weekend, selling $46m (£34m) in tickets for her 89-minute film Taylor Swift: The Official Release Party Of A Showgirl. Essentially an album launch event, the screenings included the premiere of her music video for The Fate Of Ophelia, behind-the-scenes footage from the making of the album, and Swift's commentary on the songs. Mixed reviews Swift's 12th album was written and recorded during stolen moments on the European leg of her Eras Tour last summer. It captures the star as she falls in love with American Footballer Travis Kelce; interspersed with cautionary - and sometimes catty - tales about the music industry. Taylor Swift: 'Travis crushed it with surprise proposal' Critical reviews have been mixed. Variety magazine called it "" contagiously joyful "" while the Financial Times said it "" lacked sparkle "". Speaking on BBC Radio 2's Breakfast Show with Scott Mills, the star debunked rumours that it would be her last album. Asked if she planned to retire for a life of domestic bliss, as some fans have suggested, the singer laughed: ""That's a shockingly offensive thing to say.

d53c80f85989,Tories pledge to cut bills as energy price battle takes shape,,"Tories pledge to cut bills as energy price battle takes shape Paul Seddon Political reporter, Conservative Party Conference, Manchester Getty Images Shadow energy secretary Claire Coutinho unveiled the plans during a conference speech on Monday The Conservatives are promising to roll back green energy rules to cut energy costs,  amid an emerging election battleground over the cost of household bills. The party has announced it would scrap carbon pricing and ""rip-off wind subsidies"", claiming they add 20% to electricity prices. It is the latest move from the party under leader Kemi Badenoch to turn the page on the net zero agenda that the party previously advocated in office. It comes after she opened the party's annual conference with a pledge to scrap the UK's landmark climate laws previously championed by predecessor Theresa May. Now the Tories have revealed further details of their plans to ditch green energy rules, as they join an increasingly crowded field of promises between the political parties over how to keep family bills down. The party is promising that if elected, it would abolish the post-Brexit carbon pricing system put in place by Boris Johnson as a key part of his net zero plans. It also says it would cut renewable energy subsidies by ending a regime of 20-year green energy certificates, originally introduced by Labour Energy Secretary Ed Miliband, which is currently due to continue until 2037. The Tories are promising that scrapping the two schemes would knock a combined £165 off the average household energy bill. By contrast, Labour is promising that its plan to decarbonise British electricity will cut domestic bills by £300 a year. Reform UK, meanwhile, has argued scrapping ""net zero madness"" could save families £1,000 a year. Credibility pitch As with the broader pitch on the economy, the Conservatives are hoping that voters will see its promises as more credible than those of Reform, which has leapfrogged it in the polls since its drubbing at last year's election. During a speech to outline the policy at the conference in Manchester, shadow energy secretary Claire Coutinho treated delegates to a series of slides on the effect of wind-farm pricing auctions. Wielding a remote control that brought up a succession of graphs, she sought to persuade activists - and the voters at home - that ""anyone with half a brain can see that won't cut bills"". It was a point she tried to ram home during a later fringe event, where she branded Reform's £1,000 pledge ""nonsense"" and compared it to Jeremy Corbyn's eye-catching promise of free broadband at the 2019 election. Asked why voters would not simply opt for the party promising the biggest cut, she argued voters ""do actually look at the credibility of plans"" on the cost of energy, as they ""are so worried about it"". 'Silent majority' Coutinho was an architect of the initial Tory pivot away from the net zero agenda as energy secretary to Rishi Sunak, who watered down some of the party's green commitments in a bid to revive the party's fortunes in late 2023. At that point, the Conservatives were still committed to the goal of reaching net zero carbon emissions by 2050 - a legal change brought in by another Tory leader, Theresa May, in 2019. Now it has ditched the goal entirely, with Coutinho explaining to delegates that under Badenoch the party considers all ""top-down targets"" as an enemy of its overriding focus today to provide British homes and firms with cheaper power. She told the fringe that in power, the Tories had got into the habit of ""taking policies"" from green energy lobby groups, without considering whether the ""silent majority"" out in the country would agree. She also said that she had encountered ""massive pushback"" from officials in the energy department when she sought to stop fines for boiler manufacturers who do not hit heat pump sales targets, dubbed a ""boiler tax"" by critics. The 2008 Climate Act they have now pledged to ditch, she added, had also created an ""inequality in government"" because strategies designed to reduce bills were not subject to the legally-binding nature enjoyed by climate law. Striking a remorseful tone, she told members she wished the party had scrapped the legislation when it was still in power. ""I think it's important that we recognise what we've got wrong, and we have to be very honest and clear about that,"" she added.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ce32r5k43vwo,politics,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/e9ad/live/609b7890-a2d9-11f0-a589-756e766264cb.jpg,2025-10-06T17:54:44.004000+00:00,2314bbf38bccbef51ed66fa9f1f330b1a9f7dd08
9c67192e8c64,Badenoch urged to ditch pensions triple lock,,"Kemi Badenoch is facing calls to get rid of the state pension triple lock in order to slash the welfare bill and win back younger voters, if the Conservatives return to power. Reem Ibrahim, a spokeswoman for influential right wing think tank the Institute for Economic Affairs, said: ""The triple lock is just completely unsustainable and it's being spent on some of the wealthiest demographics in the country."" Her call was echoed by Tory MP and former leadership contender Tom Tugendhat, who said young people had realised the ""entire economy is now geared towards a bunch of people who are ageing"". The Conservatives have ruled out scrapping the triple lock, which guarantees pensioners an increase in the state pension based on the highest of either inflation, wage growth or 2.5%, despite claims that the country can no longer afford it . Labour and the Liberal Democrats are also committed to keeping the triple lock, while Reform UK has said it will announce its policy before the next election . Speaking at a fringe meeting at the Conservative conference in Manchester, Ms Ibrahim branded the triple lock a ""Ponzi scheme"" - a type of investment fraud which pays profits to earlier investors with funds from more recent investors. She also said millionaires should be stripped of the state pension - and payments increased to the least well-off pensioners. ""25% of pensioners are millionaires,"" claimed Ms Ibrahim. ""I don't believe Alan Sugar deserves a state pension. I think extremely wealthy people should not get a state pension because it is just a benefit. ""I would say the same thing about the winter fuel payment. If we are going to have long-term sustainability then we have to have these honest conversations."" She was taking part in a debate about how the Conservatives can win back younger voters - a common theme at this year's conference, with the majority of the party's support coming from the over-65s at last year's general election. At another meeting, Tugendhat said young people were ""drifting away"" from the Conservatives because the party's policies did not work for them. ""This is the logical series of outcomes for an economic system which has effectively become a Ponzi scheme for the old – that is what people are choosing against. ""Young people are looking at this and realising the entire economy is now geared towards a bunch of people who are ageing. ""You can see it in numerous different ways – you can see it in the way we are still defending the triple lock – when it is simply not sustainable."" The Institute for Fiscal Studies estimates that the triple lock could push up state pension spending by anywhere between £5bn and £40bn a year by 2050. In his conference speech, Shadow Chancellor Sir Mel Stride, unveiled plans to cut £23bn from the welfare budget if the Tories win power, with a crackdown on mental health-related benefits. Shadow Business Secretary Andrew Griffith told a fringe meeting the Conservatives needed ""bold"" policies that would take voters by surprise at the next election. Asked if ending the triple lock would fall into that category, he said: ""Policy debates shouldn't be debated at the extreme. That is one part of a very, very large welfare bill."" He said Sir Mel had been right to focus on cuts to working age benefits, where people ""have got the opportunity to re-enter the workforce, improve their mental health"" rather than pensions.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckg28rl2e12o,politics,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/bc4f/live/68f600b0-a2dd-11f0-928c-71dbb8619e94.jpg,2025-10-06T18:09:47.812000+00:00,76c964f8bdd8dee8fb2ce180c6b134f3a47a41ca
7f1cb7a921f2,Conservatives promise to scrap Sentencing Council,,"The Conservatives have pledged to abolish the Sentencing Council and give ministers the power to issue guidelines to courts in England and Wales. Shadow justice secretary Robert Jenrick will set out the plans that would put ministers in charge of sentencing policy, in a speech at the party's conference. Jenrick will say the council is ""not fit for purpose"" and argue its guidelines have created a ""two-tier nightmare"", with people treated differently by the courts. The announcement comes after a public dispute earlier in the year between the Sentencing Council and the government over pre-sentence reports for offenders from certain minority groups. In response to that row, the Labour government blocked updated guidance and reviewed the role of the Sentencing Council. In September, the government said it would change the law to stop the Sentencing Council issuing new guidelines to courts in England and Wales without the explicit approval of the justice secretary. The Sentencing Bill, which is currently making its way through Parliament, would give the justice secretary veto powers over any new sentencing guidance. Last month, the then-Justice Secretary Shabana Mahmood said sentencing policy ""must be set by parliamentarians, who answer to the people"". The Conservatives want to go further and get rid of the Sentencing Council altogether. The Sentencing Council is a non-departmental public body that sets out guidance for courts in England and Wales. In his speech, Jenrick will accuse the council of watering down sentences by recommending jail terms that fall short of the maximum allowed in law. ""All too frequently the law is not applied equally,"" Jenrick will say in his speech. ""No more - every single person in this country must be treated exactly the same, regardless of their background. ""The public are sick of voting for tougher sentences and getting the opposite."" The party says a Conservative government would introduce new legislation to give the justice secretary the power to issue sentencing guidelines. Jenrick's speech comes on the third day of the party's conference in Manchester, where the Conservatives have faced questions about their flagging poll ratings and their direction of travel under the leadership of Kemi Badenoch. Speaking to the BBC, Badenoch insisted her approach to changing the party would ""pay off eventually"" and Jenrick, who was a leadership contender last year, has backed her. At a conference event on Monday, Jenrick said there was not a leadership vacancy and he did not expect there to be. ""My expectation is that Kemi will lead this party into the next general election,"" Jenrick said.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn95w5jqyz0o,politics,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/fd6f/live/f3cfdad0-a2d3-11f0-b951-27b26e912455.jpg,2025-10-06T21:43:39.827000+00:00,027f939c5a7e64a1a5e85f87e179aaf9bcf042be
ff16e3bbeaaf,Jenrick defends calling Handsworth 'worst-integrated',,"The shadow justice secretary, Robert Jenrick, has defended remarks he made in March about the Handsworth area of Birmingham, calling it ""one of the worst-integrated places"" he had ever been to. In a recording reportedly made during a dinner and published by the Guardian, Jenrick said he he had not seen ""another white face"" in the hour and a half he spent in Handsworth filming a video about litter. Anna Turley MP, chair of the governing Labour Party, criticised the opposition politician, saying his comments reduced ""people to the colour of their skin"". Handsworth's Independent MP, Ayoub Khan, said Jenrick's remarks were ""not only wildly false but also incredibly irresponsible"". The authenticity of the recording at the Aldridge-Brownhills Conservative Association is not disputed by Jenrick's team. In the recording, he goes on to say: ""That's not the kind of country I want to live in. I want to live in a country where people are properly integrated. ""It's not about the colour of your skin, or your faith, of course it isn't. But I want people to be living alongside each other, not parallel lives."" On Monday evening, Jenrick firmly stood by his remarks, saying: ""Six separate government reports over 20 years have highlighted the problem of parallel communities and called for a frank and honest conversation about the issue. ""The situation is no better today. Unlike other politicians, I won't shy away from this issue. We have to integrate communities if we are to be a united country."" Labour's Turley responded: ""This weekend Kemi Badenoch said she stood against a politics that 'reduces people to categories and then pits them against each other'. ""Robert Jenrick in his leaked comments reduces people to the colour of their skin and judges his own level of comfort by whether there are other white faces around. His comments clearly cross a red line that his leader has rightly laid down. ""People of colour should not have to justify their Englishness, or their Britishness, or their presence in this country, to Robert Jenrick or anyone else."" ""Robert Jenrick needs to urgently explain himself and why these comments are in any way compatible with what his party leader said."" Jenrick is due to address the Conservative Party's annual conference on Tuesday, when he will set out plans to put ministers in charge of sentencing policy . Khan told the Guardian that Jenrick had ""misrepresented a storied and diverse community, awkwardly distorting the product of an all-out bin strike to fit his culture-warrior narrative filled with far-right cliches"". Former Conservative Mayor of the West Midlands Andy Street told BBC Newsnight: ""Putting it bluntly, Robert is wrong."" ""Handsworth, it's come a hell of a long way in the 40 years since the last civil disturbances there and it's actually a very integrated place,"" he continued. Street also rejected Jenrick's recorded comment that Handsworth was ""the closest I've come to a slum in this country"".

Sir Keir said it was ""un-British"" to hold protests on the anniversary which, he said, had been used by some as a ""despicable excuse to attack British Jews"". The UK is seeing heightened security to protect Jewish communities, following last week's deadly attack on a synagogue in Manchester . Universities in some parts of the UK are bracing for demonstrations on Tuesday, with students from London colleges planning a joint march in the capital. Manchester, Glasgow, Edinburgh and Bristol are among other cities expecting student protests. ""Time does not diminish the evil we saw that day,"" Sir Keir wrote in a piece for the Times newspaper's Tuesday edition. ""Today, on the anniversary of the atrocities of October 7, students are once again planning protests. ""This is not who we are as a country. It's un-British to have so little respect for others. And that's before some of them decide to start chanting hatred towards Jewish people all over again."" Sir Keir stressed that the UK would ""always stand tall and united"" against those seeking to harm Jewish communities. ""Our Jewish communities have also endured rising antisemitism on our streets, in our country,"" he added. Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch warned against ""so-called 'protests' that turn into hate marches on our streets"". ""Two years on from the horrific massacre on October 7, we must also be honest: the same hatred that fuelled those barbaric attacks still festers today,"" she said. Shadow justice secretary Robert Jenrick called Tuesday's planned protests a ""disgrace"". Andy Burnham, Labour mayor of Greater Manchester, called on the government to provide more money for policing in the region following Thursday's attack on the synagogue. He said that Greater Manchester Police were under ""sustained pressure"", and that the government should ""consider the funding"" of the force so it can continue to provide the ""reassurance that all communities are looking for"". He told ITV's Peston programme: ""We face similar pressures as the Met with the largest Jewish community outside of London but we don't receive the same exceptional funding to deal with those additional pressures."" On Saturday, nearly 500 people were arrested in central London during protests in support of the proscribed group Palestine Action , the Metropolitan Police reported. The demonstrations went ahead despite pleas from ministers and police who called for protests to be postponed following the synagogue attack. Sir Keir's government recognised Palestinian statehood last month, amid international pressure to end the war in Gaza. The Israeli military launched a campaign in Gaza in response to the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage.

The main hall has not been full for speeches by members of the shadow cabinet but Badenoch said her own speech had been ""standing room only"". She said that many of the popular events took place not in the main hall but at fringe events, where people were having to queue to get in. The Conservative leader also argued that because the party was no longer in government there were fewer ""people turning up wanting government favours"". ""They've gone to Labour conference,"" she said. ""We used to be teeming with corporate lobbyists, now we are teeming with party members."" The conference - a four-day event attended by party members - is Badenoch's first as Conservative leader, having been elected nearly 12 months ago. She took on the leadership after the party suffered a heavy defeat in the 2024 general election. So far, the party has failed to improve on its poor poll ratings and performed badly at the local elections earlier this year. Speaking to the BBC, Badenoch said the party had experienced a ""tough defeat at the last election"" but added: ""We can get through it, we will come through it."" ""There are sunlit uplands ahead."" She said party members were ""thrilled"" at the polices announced in the past week including promises to leave the European Convention on Human Rights, repeal the Climate Change Act and cut £47bn from public spending.

""This is one of the first conferences I've been to where it has really felt like the members owned it, and I'm really proud of that."" During the conference, Badenoch has sought to present herself as a contrast to Reform, arguing that she is spending more time thinking through policies.

b911476e011f,Dwayne Johnson is philosophical over his film flop for The Smashing Machine,,"Dwayne Johnson is philosophical over his film flop for The Smashing Machine Helen Bushby Culture Reporter Getty Images The film was a passion project for Johnson, who is better known for action films like The Fast & Furious Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson has taken a philosophical approach to his latest film underperforming at the box office. The Smashing Machine - a sports drama about MMA legend Mark Kerr - took just $5.9 million (£4.3 million) at the US box office, a career-worst debut for one of Johnson's films;  his successes include the Fast & Furious franchise and Jumanji films. Writing on Instagram , the star framed the results as a creative achievement rather than a financial disappointment. ""In our storytelling world, you can't control box office results,"" he wrote. ""But what I realised you can control is your performance, and your commitment to completely disappear and go elsewhere. ""I will always run to that opportunity,"" he continued. ""It was my honour to transform in this role for my director Benny Safdie. ""Thank you brother for believing in me. Truth is this film has changed my life."" He signed off his post saying: ""With deep gratitude, respect and radical empathy, DJ."" How The Smashing Machine changed Dwayne Johnson's life Variety wrote that ""the film cost spent $50m (£37m) to produce (and plenty more to market)"", and early estimates predicted a healthy opening weekend of around $20m (£15m). The Smashing Machine marks a rare dramatic role for Johnson, who is best known for action franchises and family-friendly turns, including voicing a character in Disney's Moana animation. He plays Kerr, a fighter who dominated the early, unregulated days of the Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) in the 1990s - before rules such as ""no eye-gouging"" were  introduced. The film was developed from a 2002 documentary about Kerr with the same title - which contrasted the fighter's achievements with more intimate scenes, as he battled substance abuse and fought with his girlfriend. Johnson, a former wrestler, saw parallels to his own career in the documentary, and cherished the idea of dramatising it for several years. Premiered at the Venice Film Festival earlier this summer, the arthouse biopic film received rave reviews. ""The actor delivers an intoxicating mix of blood, sweat, tears, protein and total helplessness,"" wrote The Hollywood Reporter . Empire magazine called it ""the best work of his career"". However, audiences failed to materialise. As well as the disappointing US box office, the film came fourth in the UK charts, making just £863,078 - less than the Downton Abbey: The Grand Finale, which has already been in cinemas for a month. Audience tracking for the US suggested that 70% of ticket-buyers were male and 64% were between the ages of 18 to 36 - the traditional audience for Johnson's action movies. Only 8% were above 55 years old, a key demographic for arthouse releases. Those who attended the film were apparently disappointed in the lack of action scenes, with audiences giving a lukewarm ""B-"" grade in exit polls, Variety said. A24 Johnson reunites with his Jungle Cruise co-star Emily Blunt, who plays Kerr's girlfriend Dawn Staples Johnson tried to temper those expectations in the run-up to the release. ""It's not a fight movie, it's a life movie,"" he said at the red carpet premiere last month. ""Mark Kerr's life represents so much of everyone around the world, but not, 'Oh, he's the greatest fighter on the planet,' but more so, 'Oh, he struggled with pressure and how to deal with pressure,'"" Johnson explained. ""At one point, he was the greatest fighter on the planet, and then he lost - and he had a hard time reconciling with that loss. ""He overdosed twice. He's lucky to be alive, and I'm so happy that he is alive. ""Because as you know, films like this where they're a bio film, a lot of times, the main subject isn't alive... So, I'm so thankful that he is,"" he added.

Lester said the play was an exploration of human insecurity as well as the self-belief needed to overcome it. ""[Cyrano] has the insecurity. So to that extent, in many ways, we all have our nose,"" he told BBC Midlands Today. The story centres around Cyrano's romantic letters written on behalf of love rival Christian de Neuvillette (Levi Brown) as he tries to charm Roxane (Susannah Fielding). Lester added: ""We still, as a modern audience, are concerned with love, justice, insecurity and how that plays out in a world where you can do your all for people and hope they will do their all for you – where honour actually matters."" Adrian Lester stars alongside Levi Brown in Cyrano Brown, known for playing Dante in This Town, was born in Halesowen, Dudley, and said his own Midlands accent added authenticity to his role as Christian. He said: ""It's like a secret superpower almost because it's instantly grounding and instantly honest and no-nonsense. ""The attitude you get for free from the Midlands is just that – no-nonsense, get on with it, do your job."" The play started at the Swan Theatre in Stratford-upon-Avon earlier this month, with its run lasting until 15 November. Asked about his future projects, Lester said there were ""ideas on tables being discussed"". ""Me coming home to film things, either behind the camera or in front of the camera, is very much in discussion,"" he said.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cpvledzdmkgo,entertainment,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/7d50/live/0256ece0-a2ef-11f0-8009-71dc5acedc16.jpg,2025-10-07T04:54:52.252000+00:00,9f34eb35ca208b9f832c34d7c3b7f62ab7eb05b6

Murder before Evensong is based on his novel of the same name and was filmed in Bridgnorth and Worfield in Shropshire, as well as in Staffordshire, Warwickshire and Wolverhampton. Coles said he had been to Bridgnorth a couple of times before it was chosen as a location and thought it was a ""fantastic town"" and would make a ""great set"" for a drama. The Murder before Evensong series launches at 21:00 BST on 5 on Tuesday and is based on the first in the Canon Clement Mysteries, starring Matthew Lewis. Coles is a supporter of independent book stores and said he enjoyed visiting Bridgnorth, ""partly because of Booka Bridgnorth, which is a wonderful bookshop there"". He said: ""It's a very pretty town and it's quite an unusual town and I thought it would make a great set, the way it sort of hangs together where you have an upper part of town and a lower part of town."" The town, with its timber-framed houses is used for a number of locations in the series and Coles said: ""Not only does it look stunning, but its got that thing that small towns have really, it's got that community that pulse that heartbeat, lots of independent shops. ""If you think of pretty little English villages, people tend to go to the Cotswolds, but there's an awful lot happening in the West Midlands."" John Bray/BBC Richard Coles said Bridgnorth looked ""stunning"" Maggie Rogers, from The Travel Wallet in Bridgnorth, said her shop was one of the locations used and she described the production crew being ""like a SWAT team"". Of the series, which is set in the 1980s, she said: ""All these huge tall people seemed to come in here and they completely stripped anything that was current."" However, she said the town had embraced the filming and ""there was a lovely buzz around the town"". Sally Themans, from Love Bridgnorth, which promotes the town, said: ""We hope that it'll bring tourists, it will give the businesses a shot in the arm that they really need and put Bridgnorth on the map again.""

But the village of Champton and the church at the heart of the story was largely filmed in the village of Worfield, not far from Bridgnorth. Reverend Jeannetta Stokes, who has been the real-life vicar at St Peter's in Worfield for 15 years, said villagers were apprehensive at first. She said that during filming there had been an agreement the church could still be used for Sunday worship, but ""the rest of the time there were security guards on the door"". Even on Sundays, there was no access to the back rooms or side aisles, to keep the filming a secret.

Ozzy: No Escape from Now, released on Paramount+ on Tuesday, looks at Osbourne's last six years, from his battle with Parkinson's to his Villa Park farewell, including behind-the-scenes moments at the gig. Executive producer Phil Alexander said the film was a ""study in resilience"" that had allowed Osbourne to express where he was and how he felt. He said the star's family were a key part, adding the aim was to document their journey and for them to see what they'd been through themselves. PA Media On the day of his funeral, Ozzy's wife Sharon stopped to lay flowers in Birmingham's Broad Street, where fans had left hundreds of bouquets close to Black Sabbath Bridge Directed by Tania Alexander, and produced by Echo Velvet in partnership with the Osbourne family and MTV Entertainment Studios, the two-hour film includes interviews with Ozzy's wife Sharon and children, Aimee, Kelly and Jack Osbourne. Mr Alexander said the film could never have been made without Sharon Osbourne's involvement and honesty. ""You see all the vulnerabilities. You do see the impact on the family that Ozzy's recurring health issues have and you see the impact it has on him, but equally you also see the impact it has on his music."" The former editor of Kerrang! magazine, Mr Alexander said when Osbourne was at his lowest ebb, music had a restorative power, adding: ""You literally see it in front of your very eyes."" Reuters Thousands of heavy metal fans were at the final Black Sabbath concert Filming Osbourne when he was ill had been difficult, Mr Alexander said. ""It was hard to make for me because I've known Ozzy for a very long time. I've known Sharon and Ozzy for over 30 years."" What would be there ""until the end of time"" was Osbourne's humour, he said. ""It is obviously a film that has a different meaning now he's no longer with us,"" he said, ""but what you will see in the film is that sense of humour is totally intact."" He also told how the Villa Park gig had been important because Osbourne wanted to say ""thank you and goodbye"".

9b26e35b95ce,Friend or foe? Tories grapple with rise of Reform,,"The image of Nigel Farage has loomed over this party conference season, as the established parties scramble to come up with a response to the rapid rise of Reform UK. Labour and the Liberal Democrats launched all-out attacks on Farage, portraying him as a threat to the very fabric of British society. But here at the Conservative Party conference, the attacks have, in general, been more muted. Reform is not just an electoral menace to the Conservatives, but an existential one. The party is leaking members, elected officials, and influence to Reform. In the past few hours, Farage's party has unveiled a further 20 Tory defectors on local councils. The Tory leadership's strategy for dealing with this is to portray Farage as someone who does not have serious answers to the country's problems, who will say anything to get votes - including posing as a left-winger when it suits him. At an event on Sunday evening, Shadow Housing Secretary James Cleverly branded Farage a ""socialist"" - the worst insult in the Tory lexicon. The audience dutifully booed at the mention of the Reform UK leader's name but speaking to Tory members afterwards, it was clear many feel uncomfortable about these kind of attacks. They view Farage as one of their own - a Tory at heart, who should be welcomed back into the Tory fold, rather than vilified. Reform supporters are their friends and, in an increasing number of cases, former colleagues. They want to ""unite the right"" ahead of the next general election. The fact that Farage has ruled out any kind of deal with the Conservatives is met with bewilderment. Equally, Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch has also ruled out a deal with Reform. At a fringe meeting on Monday, former Brexit minister Lord Frost gave a brutal assessment of the Conservatives' prospects under its current leader. ""I think the mood of this conference so far is far too positive. And I  think we have to be honest about the situation we find ourselves in,"" he told a tent packed with Tory activists. The party had lost 10 million votes between the 2019 general election and 2024 and its dire opinion poll ratings appeared to be in free fall, he told them. ""Everything is getting worse and it has done so consistently since November last year. ""We were on 25% of the vote then, we are on 16% of the vote now. ""So no prescription for the party works unless we accept that the situation is really bad and we are on the edge of ceasing to exist as a mainstream party."" He did not mention Badenoch by name but criticised the ""torpor"" of the party over the past year, since she became leader, which he said had made it more difficult to ""recreate a proper, strong Conservative Party"". ""We need to stop rubbishing Reform or at least stop rubbishing people who vote for Reform,"" he said to cheers from Tory activists. ""We look to the country like we've got some sort of right to votes. We look entitled."" Frost said the answer was a shift to the right on policy and a clearer definition of what the Tory party stands for, with no place in it for those who did not agree. Frost's gloomy prognosis is not shared by other senior Tory figures, in public at least. Former Brexit Secretary David Davis joked this week that Nigel Farage asks him to defect to Reform UK every time he sees him. ""Oh, every time I see him and Lee Anderson. I mean, 'the doors always open, David', and because it's a daytime programme I won't say what I said,"" he told BBC Radio 5's Matt Chorley. At a fringe meeting on Monday, Davis said he believed Kemi Badenoch was ""on the right lines"" and the party could win the next election. He argued that the UK was on the brink of a financial crisis ""because there is no way out of the current financial circumstance that is available to the Labour Party"". And this, he argued, will present ""enormous opportunities"" for the Conservatives, who he said are prepared to make the ""tough decisions"" needed to get the country's finances back on track. Just as the run up to the 1979 general election was overshadowed by economic turmoil and decline, so it will be in 2029, claimed the veteran Tory MP. ""As the only person here who actually served under Margaret Thatcher,"" he told the packed fringe meeting. ""I can tell you that in the late 70s, she was being talked down too. ""For precisely the same reasons. A bit too tough, a bit too hard edged, a bit too dangerous... but then we had a crisis and, suddenly, Thatcher was the right answer. ""If we have another crisis, then Badenoch will be the right answer too."" It's not a message the Tory leader is likely to repeat in her conference speech on Wednesday - but how she calibrates her response to the threat of Farage and Reform will have a major bearing on whether she will survive long enough to test the theory out.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cly7l65xy23o,politics,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/8a45/live/778270e0-a36f-11f0-b6c8-ab6f97553cbf.jpg,2025-10-07T12:21:01.692000+00:00,84940561b99283228c2856f734bd041bf20ca8d5

Peter Windsor, 61, of Mary Road, Stechford, in Birmingham, had denied two counts of stalking causing ""serious alarm or distress"" to Ms Klass and fellow Classic FM presenter Katie Breathwick between 2020 and 2024. A trial at Birmingham Crown Court heard Windsor had sent the women numerous ""unwanted"" gifts, including a will-writing kit, at the radio station's central London studios between March 2020 and August 2024. Ms Klass told the jury of her ""sheer terror"" after she was informed of the ""accumulation"" of items. The former Hear'Say singer became upset while giving evidence as she told the court how Royal Mail had found an air pistol addressed to her. ""It just felt extreme on every front,"" the 47-year-old said. She explained she was initially not told about the post to avoid worrying her, but was later shown a list of items and photographs of some of the letters by her employer's security staff. ""It was very clear, very quickly, that it was a highly volatile selection of items,"" she told prosecutor Timothy Sapwell. ""It was a huge shock, especially the extent to which it had escalated. It's a huge violation. It's sheer terror, really."" Windsor, who has been diagnosed with schizophrenia, called Ms Klass a ""naughty vixen"" in one of his letters. He also sent Mrs Breathwick a letter saying he wanted to go paddling in a lake with both women while drinking champagne. PA Media Jurors reached a verdict on Tuesday after deliberating for more than four hours Mrs Breathwick also became audibly upset whilst giving evidence last week, telling the court she had first received correspondence from Windsor at the start of the Covid-19 pandemic. ""The first note was something to do with how many push-ups and pull-ups he had done. It was weird. It was a note of a personal nature talking about me as if he knew me,"" she told jurors. The mail, some addressed to her alone and some to both her and Ms Klass, had included a reference to witchcraft, the 53-year-old added. She said among about 100 notes and gifts she had received was a DIY will-writing kit, sent in March 2021. ""I was terrified - I was terrified because what was his intention?"" she said. Asked to comment on a pair of binoculars that had also been sent to her, Mrs Breathwick told the court: ""I was really frightened by this stage. I thought he had sent me the binoculars to tell me he was watching me."" West Midlands Police/PA Media Mrs Breathwick described how notes and items sent by Windsor left her feeling terrified Judge Tom Rochford also heard Windsor had previously been arrested but not prosecuted after sending a letter in October 2020 to then Scottish first minister Nicola Sturgeon. He said the letter had been ""signed in blood"" and ""pledged his soul to Satan"" but claimed it was ""just a joke"". Jurors reached their unanimous guilty verdicts on Tuesday, after deliberating for four hours and eight minutes over two days. Windsor, wearing a grey sweatshirt, sighed and pursed his lips in the dock as the verdicts were announced. The judge told the defendant, who had been on remand throughout his trial, that the options for his sentencing next month included prison or two types of hospital order.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cj0766g9edyo,entertainment,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/8f04/live/11188690-a370-11f0-b6c8-ab6f97553cbf.jpg,2025-10-07T13:04:30.050000+00:00,d32b1ef5b745f53c7572ce2103690622c53c2ed0

49dfd6e96631,Paddington creators sue after Spitting Image depicts him as crude podcast host,,"Paddington creators sue after Spitting Image depicts him as crude podcast host Emma Saunders Culture reporter Avalon The producers behind the hit Paddington films and the estate of his creator, Michael Bond, are suing the company behind Spitting Image after it depicted the beloved bear as a foul-mouthed podcast host. As first reported in Deadline , the claimants, represented by law firm Edwin Coe, have filed a High Court complaint against Avalon, citing copyright and design right concerns. While the filing does not reveal the details of the claim, it comes months after the  Spitting Image YouTube show, called The Rest is Bullsh*t!, featuring the fictional bear, was released. Avalon, StudioCanal and Michael Bond's estate declined to comment when contacted by the BBC. Edwin Coe have also been asked for comment. For those familiar with the bear from Peru, who first appeared on the scene in Bond's 1958 book, A Bear Called Paddington, the sketch is a somewhat different portrayal of the children's character. In Spitting Image's parody, Paddington is hosting a podcast with Prince Harry, where the bear is seen swearing, reading adverts for guns and robot sex dolls and admitting to taking cocaine. His accent has changed to a stereotypically strong South American one, as he reveals he doesn't really sound like Ben Whishaw, the British actor who voiced his character in the popular Paddington films. The pair are seen interviewing X owner Elon Musk and the footage also features sketches including US President Donald Trump and UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer. The Rest Is Bullsh*t! is intended to poke fun at podcast series The Rest Is..., produced by Gary Lineker's Goalhanger productions. A more recent episode shows Paddington make further references to his drug habit. Avalon The Spitting Image TV show, which lampooned celebrities, politicians and royals, was a huge hit for ITV when it first ran in the 1980s and 1990s. The Bafta and Emmy award-winning television series originally ran for 18 series between 1984 and 1996, returning between 2020 and 2022 on Britbox. It also spawned a musical.

The Conservative leader said the UK had ""taken for granted the fact that we have been a fairly cohesive society"" but warned ""things are fragmenting"". But she warned that immigration levels were too high, adding that ""If people come in too quickly, it's impossible to integrate"". She also defended remarks made by Shadow Justice Secretary Robert Jenrick who said Handsworth in Birmingham was ""one of the worst-integrated places"" he had ever been to. In a recording reportedly made in March during a dinner and published by the Guardian, the shadow justice secretary said he had not seen ""another white face"" in the hour and a half he spent in Handsworth filming a video about litter. He went on: ""I want to live in a country where people are properly integrated. ""It's not about the colour of your skin, or your faith, of course it isn't. But I want people to be living alongside each other, not parallel lives."" Asked about the comments, he told the BBC's Chris Mason: ""There are numerous parts of our country now where the same story is happening, and at the extreme levels, a lack of integration leads us into a very dark place as a country. ""We're here in Manchester today, a week on from a terrible terrorist attack where a man who lived in our country for 30 years clearly wasn't well integrated, clearly didn't share British values because he went on to murder British Jews."" His earlier comments have provoked criticism from opposition politicians. Badenoch defended his comments, and said they were made during the bin strike in Birmingham . ""Rubbish piled up in the streets and what were the politicians focusing on - airports in Pakistan and Gaza,"" she said. ""We need people to have their eyes focused on what is going on in this country."" Badenoch told the BBC's political editor Chris Mason that immigration was something her party ""got wrong"" in government and that was why she was coming up with ""tougher"" policies including leaving the European Convention on Human Rights and a plan to deport 750,000 illegal immigrants in five years. In addition to reducing levels of immigration, Badenoch also said the government needed to be ""making sure people understand what our values are"". ""Not being tolerant of intolerance, not looking away because we are afraid of being labelled racists. ""That's one of the things I saw with the grooming gang scandal - a lot could have been done to stop that. ""State authorities were too scared to intervened because they were afraid of looking prejudice."" While Badenoch was conducting a string of media interviews, Reform UK announced that 20 Conservative councillors were defecting. The Conservatives are facing a political challenge from Reform, who have been leading in recent opinion polls. At the Conservative conference this week, Conservatives have been discussing how to respond to the threat posed by Nigel Farage's party . A slew of policy announcements during the conference has counteracted the accusation, levelled at Badenoch, that she had previously left a vacuum that Reform had filled. But Badenoch dismissed the announcement of the defections as ""a stunt"". ""Some people just want to go with whoever is winning. Lots of people jump around with the polls,"" she said. ""If they are not tough enough to deal with difficulties in opposition, they are not going to be tough enough to deal with difficulties in government.""

""Please, just stop sending me AI videos of Dad,"" Zelda Williams posted on her Instagram stories. ""Stop believing I wanna see it or that I'll understand, I don't and I won't. If you're just trying to troll me, I've seen way worse, I'll restrict and move on. ""But please, if you've got any decency, just stop doing this to him and to me, to everyone even, full stop. It's dumb, it's a waste of time and energy, and believe me, it's NOT what he'd want."" This is not the first time Zelda Williams, a film director, has criticised AI versions of her father, who took his own life in 2014 at his Californian home at the age of 63. Williams, who was famous for films such as Good Morning Vietnam, Dead Poets Society and Mrs Doubtfire, was understood to have been battling depression at the time of his death. In 2023, in an Instagram post supporting a campaign against AI by US media union SAG-Aftra, she described attempts at recreating his voice as ""personally disturbing"", while also pointing to the wider implications. Getty Images Zelda and Robin Williams attended the 2007 People's Choice Awards in Los Angeles Her post on Tuesday reflects a trend on social media, where images of people who have died are animated, featuring  captions like ""bring your loved ones back to life"". Williams continued: ""To watch the legacies of real people be condensed down to 'this vaguely looks and sounds like them so that's enough', just so other people can churn out horrible TikTok slop puppeteering them is maddening,"" she continued. ""You're not making art, you're making disgusting, over-processed hotdogs out of the lives of human beings, out of the history of art and music, and then shoving them down someone else's throat hoping they'll give you a little thumbs up and like it. Gross."" She concluded: ""And for the love of EVERY THING, stop calling it 'the future,' AI is just badly recycling and regurgitating the past to be re-consumed. You are taking in the Human Centipede of content, and from the very very end of the line, all while the folks at the front laugh and laugh, consume and consume."" The Human Centipede is a reference to the 2009 body horror film. 'She sparks conversation' Her latest comments come in the wake of unease following the unveiling of ""AI actor"", Tilly Norwood. Norwood was created by Dutch actor and comedian Eline Van der Velden, who reportedly said she wanted Norwood to become the ""next Scarlett Johansson"". In a statement, SAG-Aftra said Norwood ""is not an actor, it's a character generated by a computer program that was trained on the work of countless professional performers. ""It has no life experience to draw from, no emotion and, from what we've seen, audiences aren't interested in watching computer-generated content untethered from the human experience,"" the union added. Actress Emily Blunt also recently said she found the idea of Norwood terrifying. ""That is really, really scary, Come on, agencies, don't do that. Please stop. Please stop taking away our human connection,"" she said on a podcast with Variety. Van der Velden later said in a statement : ""To those who have expressed anger over the creation of my AI character, Tilly Norwood, she is not a replacement for a human being, but a creative work – a piece of art. ""Like many forms of art before her, she sparks conversation, and that in itself shows the power of creativity.""",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0r0erqk18jo,entertainment,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/6ba0/live/e26fba40-a38b-11f0-9d41-9dadd041fb76.jpg,2025-10-07T15:51:39.458000+00:00,a8dbab239ef0415bb2f0311b936d7945b92a036c
f02da4c37338,Tories promise to treble stop and search in crime hotspots,,"A Conservative government would triple the use of stop and search powers in high crime areas in England and Wales, the shadow home secretary has said. In a speech to his party's conference, Chris Philp said the move would was vital to prevent knife crime. He also promised to recruit an extra 10,000 police officers if the Tories win the next general election. And he set out plans he said would ensure ""sustained negative net migration"" by setting a binding annual cap on immigration. Net migration in the UK - the difference between the numbers entering and leaving the country - stood at 690,100 in the year to June 2024. During their 14 years in government, the Conservatives consistently failed to meet their ambition to reduce it to the ""tens of thousands"". But Philp said the next Conservative government would ensure more people leave than arrive by setting an annual binding target voted on each year by Parliament. ""Let me say this: the days of mass, low-skill migration has to end,"" he told the Tory conference in Manchester. ""And that is why we will ensure that those who have come already to work, but have then not worked or have only worked on low wages, they must leave when their visa expires. ""And that is why only those who are making a contribution can stay here permanently, and those who are not citizens cannot expect to receive any benefits funded by taxpayers."" Turning to law and order, Philp set out plans to hire 10,000 extra police officers at a cost of £800m a year, which he said would be funded by some of the savings proposed by Shadow Chancellor Sir Mel Stride in his conference speech . And he said he would increase police use of stop and search if he becomes home secretary. ""It's insane that the smell of cannabis alone, or somebody wearing a menacing mask alone, does not generally allow, legally, a stop and search,"" he said. ""Now in my view, a single suspicion indicator should be enough. ""So, in our hotspot areas, we will allow routine stop and search without suspicion. Anyone can be searched. ""We will change the law to do this, and we will triple the use of stop and search. ""Lives will be saved and knives will be taken off our streets. We have the courage to do that, Labour does not."" In 2014, then Conservative Home Secretary Theresa May tightened up the rules on stop and search after an inquiry found 27% of police searches may have been illegal. When misused, stop and search was ""an enormous waste of police time"" and ""an unacceptable affront to justice"", she said at the time. But the policy was reversed in 2019 by her successor Sajid Javid , who made it easier to making it easier for officers to search people without reasonable suspicion in places where serious violence may occur. In April 2022, the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC), made 18 recommendations to police forces across England and Wales to address the ""disproportionate use of stop-and-search on people from black, Asian and other ethnic minority backgrounds"".",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cp8wgnz1r3xo,politics,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/9439/live/dcbb3f50-a39c-11f0-928c-71dbb8619e94.jpg,2025-10-07T17:14:34.162000+00:00,0f8fbfb734ebd600edbf6d9bf2a5994336393cfc
bb04defaaf90,"Threat assessment of China led to spy case collapse, says CPS",,"The UK's most senior prosecutor has said a case involving two men accused of spying for China collapsed because he could not obtain evidence from the government referring to China as a national security threat. Sir Keir Starmer has said the government was only able to draw upon the previous Conservative government's assessment of China, which only went as far as calling the country an ""epoch-defining challenge"". Charges against Christopher Cash, 30, and Christopher Berry, 33 - who both deny the allegations - were dropped by prosecutors in September, prompting criticism from ministers and MPs. The director of public prosecutions, Stephen Parkinson, said there was sufficient evidence to prosecute at the time charges were brought in April 2024, but that a precedent set by another spying case had raised the threshold needed to convict people under the Official Secrets Act. He said the Crown Prosecution Service had made ""efforts to obtain"" further evidence from the government ""over many months"" but that the witness statements provided did not meet the threshold needed to continue with the prosecution. Mr Parkinson said the evidence would have needed to represent China as ""a threat to national security"" at the time of the alleged offences by Mr Cash and Mr Berry. But the prime minister has said that the government's description of China could not change retrospectively and had to be based on ""the position of the last government"". The government has always maintained it is ""frustrated"" that the trial collapsed and Mr Parkinson's intervention comes after weeks of speculation about why the prosecution could not continue. Mr Cash, a former parliamentary researcher, and Mr Berry, were accused of gathering and providing information prejudicial to the safety and interests of the state between December 2021 and February 2023. Under the Official Secrets Act, anyone accused of spying can only be prosecuted if the information they passed on was useful to an enemy. Last month Mr Parkinson said in a letter that ""the case could no longer proceed to trial since the evidence no longer met the evidential test"", but said he could not go into the reasons why. In his latest letter, sent to MPs, he said he was taking the ""unusual"" step of sharing more details because ""government briefings have been provided commenting on the evidential situation"". Mr Parkinson said a trial earlier this year involving Bulgarian nationals who had been spying for China, ruled that under the Official Secrets Act, an enemy ""includes a country which represents at the time of the offence, a threat to the national security of the UK"". He said that meant ""further evidence should be obtained"" from the government in order to proceed with the prosecution but said the evidence was not ""forthcoming"". Mr Parkinson added: ""Efforts to obtain that evidence were made over many months, but notwithstanding the fact that further witness statements were provided, none of these stated that at the time of the offence China represented a threat to national security."" The Sunday Times previously reported that senior Whitehall officials met to discuss the trial early last month before the charges were dropped. Number 10's press secretary said on Monday ""the suggestion that the government withheld evidence, withdrew witnesses or restricted the ability of a witness to draw on a particular bit of evidence are all untrue"". Since last year's general election, the Labour government has shown signs of wanting to re-set ties between the UK and China and is conducting what it calls a cross-Whitehall ""audit"" of Britain's relationship with the country. In October 2024, David Lammy became only the second foreign secretary in six years to visit China, where he said Beijing and London should ""find pragmatic solutions to complex challenges"". The UK's national security adviser Jonathan Powell, one of Sir Keir Starmer's most senior advisers and political allies, also visited the country earlier this year. The trip, which took place in July, was not announced by the UK government, but became public when the Chinese government released details of a meeting between Mr Powell and the Chinese foreign minister Wang Yi. Beijing said Mr Powell had ""expressed Britain's willingness to enhance dialogue and communication with China to build a stable, practical and long-term partnership"".",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy8rl7e7xp3o,politics,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/99b2/live/668aeee0-a3b3-11f0-9871-a159926144cf.jpg,2025-10-07T21:04:33.992000+00:00,fa5deb8d353d12bd384295f19cfe647b41de94a8

The prime minister is leading a delegation of more than 100 entrepreneurs, cultural leaders and university vice chancellors, as he attempts to boost UK investment and improve sluggish economic growth. Sir Keir said there were ""massive opportunities"" to improve trade and cultural ties with India. But he said there were no plans to open up more visa routes to Indian workers or students. ""The issue is not about visas,"" Sir Keir said. ""It's about business to business engagement and investment and jobs and prosperity coming into the United Kingdom."" The UK's trade deal with India was signed in July after years of negotiation. It will mean UK cars and whisky will be cheaper to export to India, and Indian textiles and jewellery cheaper to export to the UK as part of the multi-billion pound trade boost. The deal included a three-year exemption on social security paid by Indian employees working in the UK on short-term visas. But ministers insisted there were not wider changes in immigration policy. The Labour government is trying to cut levels of immigration into the UK and announced a tough policy on settlement status at the party's conference last week. Speaking to reporters on the plane on the way to Mumbai, Sir Keir said visas ""played no part"" in the trade deal with India and that situation had not changed. Asked whether the UK might consider trying to attract tech entrepreneurs in the wake of US President Donald Trump's changes to the H-1B visa in the US, Sir Keir said the UK wanted to attract ""top talent"" from across the globe to help grow the UK economy, but repeatedly said there were no plans for new visa routes to India. Among the businesses travelling with the PM was British Airways, which announced plans to  introduce a third daily flight between Delhi and Heathrow next year. Manchester Airport also revealed a new direct route to Delhi. During the two-day trip, the prime minister is expected to meet Prime Minister Narendra Modi who ahead of Sir Keir's visit had conveyed his ""warm birthday greetings"" to Russian President Vladimir Putin on social media. Sir Keir said he would not be following suit, telling reporters: ""Just for the record, I haven't sent birthday congratulations to Putin, nor am I going to do so. I don't suppose that comes as a surprise."" Asked whether he would criticise Modi over India's purchase of Russian oil, Sir Keir said the UK's focus was on Russia's shadow fleet of oil tankers. The prime minister said the UK had been one of ""the lead countries in relation to the 'shadow fleet'"" - the name given to unregulated tankers ferrying oil from Russia.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c9wdzryk477o,politics,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/e168/live/3fc3d760-a3b6-11f0-907b-11551cdd871c.jpg,2025-10-08T00:50:58.649000+00:00,6edc86c8ec5e7e8390bbb3bcd4916ef242ab6b93
6cbcdb65f3c5,Badenoch to set out new rule to cut borrowing and taxes,,"The Conservatives will commit to a new economic ""golden rule"" designed to cut government borrowing and taxes, party leader Kemi Badenoch will say in her keynote speech to the party's conference. The party says the rule would ensure half of all savings made by a future Conservative government would be put towards reducing the deficit, which is the gap between spending and tax revenues. The other half of every pound saved would be used for policies aimed at growing the economy, including tax cuts. Badenoch will say the Conservatives are the only party ""with a plan to get our economy back on track"". ""It starts with fiscal responsibility,"" Badenoch will say. ""We have to get the deficit down and we must also show how every tax cut or spending increase is paid for."" She will accuse the Labour government of risking the UK's financial stability with a ""borrowing and tax doom loop"". Badenoch will say Labour's economic plans are ""not sustainable"" and equate government borrowing to ""stealing from our children and grandchildren"". At the conference, her party has pledged to save £47bn a year from cuts to welfare, the civil service and foreign aid, if it gets back into government. It has also made £9bn worth of spending commitments on policies including a £5,000 tax rebate for young people and abolishing business rates for High Street shops. Badenoch will attempt to rebuild the party's credibility on the economy and further distance herself from former Tory Prime Minister Liz Truss, whose tax-cutting mini-budget spooked financial markets and led to her resignation in 2022. The Tory leader will also try to reclaim the mantle of financial prudence from Labour, which has sought to position itself as the party of sound money and economic stability since winning power. But the government is facing a challenging autumn Budget, not least because a rebellion by Labour MPs derailed a plan to save billions on welfare spending earlier this year. Economists have said taxes will have to go up if Chancellor Rachel Reeves is to meet her self-imposed rules on borrowing to fund public services. The Conservatives want to focus on reducing public sector net borrowing (PSNB), which represents the difference between total government spending - including capital investments - and total tax receipts. In its latest forecast, the Office for Budget Responsibility said PSNB is forecast to fall from £137.3bn (4.8% of GDP) this year to £74bn (2.1% of GDP) in 2029-30. The Conservatives say they are concerned about the level of overall borrowing and interest payments on the debt. Party sources say they are sceptical of Labour's plans to bring down the deficit and doubt the OBR's forecasts will bear out in reality. Getting the deficit down was one of the main economic policies of David Cameron's coalition and Conservative governments from 2010. Under Badenoch, the Conservatives are shifting back in that direction and the language in her speech mirrors that of the former Conservative Chancellor George Osborne, who oversaw years of spending cuts in a bid to reduce the deficit. Reform UK has also promised to make savings worth billions to offset big spending on tax cuts, the NHS and defence. At the conference, Conservatives have branded Reform UK ""socialist"" over their promises to increase spending and nationalise industries. Like other parties, the Conservatives have upped their attacks on Reform UK, which is leading UK-wide opinion polls. Badenoch has faced repeated questions about her leadership at the conference in Manchester. It is her first conference as Conservative leader after she was elected last year in the wake of the party's heavy defeat in the 2024 general election. Her party performed badly at the local elections earlier this year and the Conservatives have sunk far below Reform UK and Labour in the polls since. But speaking to the BBC ahead of her speech, Badenoch insisted her approach would pay off in the long run. She said: ""I'm not losing. I'm going to be winning.""",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c39r8k27rm9o,politics,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/b7cf/live/be924cd0-a39c-11f0-95e7-93813d968835.jpg,2025-10-08T00:55:18.313000+00:00,8fb7d2adc6b5819087feb5cb14022179901083b5
464832ad9e6c,Romesh Ranganathan on overexposure and feeling 'intimidated' by Sheridan Smith,,"Romesh Ranganathan on overexposure and feeling 'intimidated' by Sheridan Smith Steven McIntosh Entertainment reporter BBC Ranganathan will star in a new West End production of Woman in Mind opposite Sheridan Smith Comedian Romesh Ranganathan will make his West End debut later this year, co-starring in a play with Sheridan Smith. But although it's first time acting on stage, he tells BBC News he's aware of the risks of overexposure. The 47-year-old is already one of the most familiar faces in British entertainment, with a CV that includes The Weakest Link, A League of Their Own, a BBC Radio 2 show, hosting the TV Baftas, and several documentaries and sitcoms. From December, Ranganathan will also appear in a new production of Alan Ayckbourn's Woman in Mind. But taking on new roles isn't without risk, in an entertainment landscape where the public can grow tired of seeing the same stars. ""Well, I just want to put this out there, and I'd love you to publicise this as much as possible: I do say no to stuff,"" Ranganathan jokes to BBC News. ""I'm not just walking around taking whatever's offered. ""The truth is, people say to me 'you're on everything' - that accusation has been levelled at me. ""But I feel like whenever I'm thinking about doing something, I'm just asking, do I think think this will be good, is it something I'd watch, is it something I think I'd be able to do a decent job at? And then, if the answer to those questions is yes, that's what makes you do it. ""I mean, obviously I need a fee as well,"" he laughs, ""there's no point in doing it totally for the love of the game."" Ranganathan hosts TV quiz The Weakest Link (pictured) and a BBC Radio 2 weekend show Many figures at the very top of television - Ant and Dec, Michael McIntyre and Claudia Winkleman - are selective with their choices, notably hosting no more than three or four shows each per year. But when a particular star is in demand, it can be tricky to strike the delicate balance between saying yes to work while not taking on too much. ""I understand the thing about overexposure, but if that happens, it happens,"" Ranganathan reflects. ""I try not to overthink things that much, to be honest. ""You normally just have a gut feeling whether something's good or not or whether you'll be good for it or not. ""But who knows, maybe after this play goes out, the general public might say 'OK we've had enough', and I'll go and work in a café or something."" Ranganathan will join the previously announced Smith in Woman in Mind, which will run at London's Duke of York's Theatre from 9 December until 28 February, before playing additional dates in Sunderland and Glasgow in March. Ayckbourn's psychological comedy follows a woman named Susan, who has an accident that leaves her with a head injury. A new fantasy life emerges in front of her, before the line between her real and imagined lives begins to blur. ""I play her doctor, who basically is the only link between the two worlds throughout the play,"" Ranganathan explains. Sheridan Smith told Radio 2's Scott Mills she was ""so excited"" to be starring in the show Smith shot to fame in the early noughties sitcoms The Royle Family and Two Pints of Lager and a Packet of Crisps, and went on to appear in The Railway Children Return and ITV's Cilla, which saw her portray the legendary British entertainer Cilla Black. But she has also has a huge number of stage credits - she led West End hits such as Funny Girl and Shirley Valentine, and has won two Olivier Awards for her roles in Legally Blonde and Flare Path. Announcing her role in Woman in Mind last month, Smith told BBC Radio 2's Scott Mills : ""I'm so excited, this is an amazing part for an actress. ""It's thought of as one of Alan Ayckbourn's finest plays, it's really funny and it's got a lot of darkness as it goes on. ""There are loads of characters, it's just bonkers and brilliant, it's kind of like a big farce. I can't wait to get started."" Working with Sheridan 'exciting but intimidating' Woman in Mind premiered in 1985 and has since been revived in the US and the UK several times. Stockard Channing, Julia McKenzie and Dame Helen Mirren have all previously played the role of Susan. Ranganathan says he and Smith had a text exchange when he was cast, adding: ""It's both exciting and intimidating, because she's obviously incredibly talented, phenomenal at what she does, so it's an honour to be doing it opposite her. ""But also what it means is my abilities will be in sharp contrast to that, so there's a little bit of added pressure. But we're both excited, I've not worked with her before so I'm looking forward to that."" Oliver Rosser Ranganathan (pictured in character with his stethoscope) plays Susan's doctor in the show The comic has previously acted in TV sitcoms such as Avoidance and Romantic Getaway, but this will mark his first time acting on stage. ""Well, since primary school"", he laughs. ""I might have played second shepherd in the Nativity."" Ranganathan says he feels ""nervous"" about his West End debut, but adds: ""It was something I'd been thinking about doing for a while. ""I'd been talking about it for maybe a year or two, my wife is an ex-drama teacher and has a real passion for theatre, so it's something I started discussing, but I didn't know what it would be. This kind of popped up and they were kind enough to let me read for it, and it felt like an opportunity too good to miss."" The new adaptation will be directed by Michael Longhurst, with Ranganathan noting: ""It's going to be very close to the source material, but the way it might be performed and presented might be a little bit different. ""But what I want to do is allay any fears that we might decide to rap it,"" he jokes. ""There's nothing like that in the works.""",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c39r3ylnjpzo,entertainment,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/f305/live/966799a0-9dec-11f0-92db-77261a15b9d2.jpg,2025-10-08T01:47:52.832000+00:00,0c53acebfde1438be5eafad7e4542f3294257c21

His latest book, Always Remember, sees the return of all the much-loved characters from his previous book, but the author believes he could have finished it earlier had he been able to keep hold of his iPad. ""A lot of drawings got stolen from my car,"" he explained. ""I started doing rough drawings and writing situations for the book on the iPad, because it was easier. So, I basically put together a lot of the pages and it hadn't backed itself up."" Charlie Gray Charlie says his beloved dog Barney is now ""flying"" The thief and the iPad The Boy, The Mole, The Fox and the Horse was a lockdown sensation, and in 2021 it was named the biggest selling adult hardback of all time in the UK .

""I literally ran into the Co-op to get some snacks and chatted to Jen who works there and came back out again. I hadn't locked the car. I'm an idiot."" He said the iPad had been on the passengers' seat and he that he had lost ""quite a lot"" of the book. The next few nights were spent with him lying in bed going: ""What was that? What did I say?"" and trying to remember the missing sections. After that, the way he dealt with the iPad's loss sounds like the sort of positive advice which made his first book such a phenomenon during the pandemic. ""Like all these things, you either get knocked and give up or go, 'This isn't going to stop me'. This room is full of drawings, so I could go back and look and dig deep and try and remember. ""It was just another little setback, I suppose, that makes you question whether what you are doing is worthwhile."" 'Very hard, very raw' The theft was not the only major blow which Mackesy experienced during the creation of Always Remember. He lost his ""lovely mum"" two years ago and his beloved dog Barney, the inspiration for the Mole character, also died. ""He was 19. He's flying now,"" Mackesy says wistfully. ""It was very hard, very raw, because animals you are with 24 hours a day and it wasn't easy.""

But at the same time he has to deal with death of a number of loved ones. ""Big issues are indiscriminate. Everyone has to go through them,"" he nods.

Mackesy describes how during lockdown he received ""terrifying numbers of emails"" through his website, remembering one occasion when his phone said that he had 86,000 unread emails. ""While I'm eating spaghetti or asleep, the book is still busy,"" is how he describes it. Many were from nurses and doctors in Covid wards, and teachers without pupils, who would print out his illustrations as a way of encouraging others. He also describes the privilege of meeting people who say they are only alive because of one of his drawings, recounting the tale of one 19-year-old who queued at a signing, simply to tell him that he had ""stayed"". By this he meant that he decided not to end his life and that he decided that it was brave to ask for help. ""If we had made the book just for him, it would have been worth it,"" muses Mackesy. ""This is how I define success – hearing from real people."" Charlie Mackesy Some of the trees which Charlie has planted in Suffolk When it comes to how he spends his earnings from the book, it is not so much a case of wild living, more rewilding. ""Well, I pay the rent a bit better than I used to,"" he surmises, ""But I'm in the same house wearing the same old jumper,"" he adds, before revealing his one big extravagance – planting 2,000 trees in Suffolk. ""I've become obsessed with trees. I've bought some land and I just can't stop. Even on the train here I was looking up buying some alder trees, some red alder. ""Some bird cherry trees, because it brings the land alive. This land was very silent when I got it, now it's full of butterflies and bees. It's wild. I can sit there and go, 'Look at all this. This wasn't here before.' ""There's an emptiness to living in a certain way, and if you can just do something that might help someone somewhere or do something for the environment. To give back in some way is a good thing."" I gently ask if part of his motivation is to replace the some of the vast number of trees which must have been cut down to produce the millions of copies of The Boy, the Mole, the Fox and the Horse, which have sold. ""I can't believe you've said that,"" he laughs with mock incredulity. ""I'm doing it because I love it and it's a good thing. Trees live longer than we do and we know that they are good for the Earth. And they are beautiful. They just take a while."" This is said by someone who should know, Mackesy having found overnight success shortly before turning 60. Charlie Mackesy The mole always wants cake His future plans involve working on a new project involving a girl and a elephant, there is a planned collaboration with the V&A Museum, and he hopes to create a non-blank blank journal, featuring encouraging messages, designed to make the empty page less intimidating. One thing he will not stop doing is putting pen to paper. ""I can't avoid this feeling that if I just do another drawing, I might hear from a lady in Australia who can't get up in the morning, or a guy who's in rehab. It's a desire to connect in a way that is a life giving."" He pauses before adding, ""I'm not very good at explaining why I do things.""

c1b25e91b3ff,'One of the greatest things' - Nigeria's art innovators on display in London,,"'One of the greatest things' - Nigeria's art innovators on display in London The estate of Uzo Egonu Uzo Egonu's Stateless People an artist with beret (1981) This is ""one of the greatest things to have happened, not only to my art, but to Nigerian artwork"", 93-year-old painter and sculptor Bruce Onobrakpeya says as he looks around the rooms at the Tate Modern, one of London's premier art museums. ""The collection is fantastic and it brings back a lot of memories going back 50, 60, 70 years."" Onobrakpeya is among more than 50 artists whose work is going on show at the gallery on the south bank of the Thames as part of Nigerian Modernism, an ambitious presentation that spans a period from 1910 to the 1990s. Tate Bruce Onobrakpeya's The Last Supper (1981) Nike Davies-Okundaye / Kavita Chellaram Nike Davies-Okundaye's Animal World (1968) To Onobrakpeya, affectionately called Baba Bruce within art circles, Nigerian Modernism is ""a transfer of the old ideas, old items, old technologies, old thought into a different, modern time"". It is ""projecting the present, and showing the way towards the future"". Walking through the Tate's lofty rooms, pieces that blend indigenous Nigerian techniques like bronze casting, mural painting and wood carving, with more European styles are all on show. Jimoh Buraimoh / Kavita Chellaram Jimoh Buraimoh's Figural Abstract (1973) Ben Enwonwu Foundation Ben Enwonwu's The Dancer (1962) There are naturalistic paintings documenting real-life events and more abstract works, like those of visual artist, drummer and actor Muraina Oyelami. Oyelami is pleased to be part of such a major exhibition, even if the label ""modernist"" means very little to him. ""I made artworks, paintings. If the writer or the critic now comes and says: 'This is modernism' or whatever 'ism'"" - that's his or her terms of reference,"" he says. ""If that is what they call it, why not? I don't care."" Muraina Oyelami Muraina Oyelami's untitled painting (1965) Ben Enwonwu Foundation Ben Enwonwu's The Durbar of Eid-ul-Fitr (1955) For Oyelami, the 1960s and 70s were an ""exciting time"" to be an artist in Nigeria. It was also a turbulent time - the Tate's collection tracks the nation's journey from a British colony, to a fledging, independent country, to the setting of a grisly civil war. The Biafran war - which lasted from 1967 to 1970 - is reflected by artists from the Nsukka Art School, an influential art department and movement that was founded by students and professors at the University of Nigeria. Obiora Udechukwu Obiora Udechukwu's Our Journey (1993) El Anatsui / Tate El Anatsui's Solemn Crowds at Dawn (1965) It is one of many instrumental art collectives explored in the exhibition. ""It is not just about the way in which artists are working on their individual artistic projects - you get the sense that almost all the artists in this exhibition are guided by a principle of collectivity,"" notes Osei Bonsu, the exhibition's curator. Bonsu has brought together a collection of incredible breadth - from watercolours to photography to miniscule thorn carvings to political cartoons. Artists hail from various ethnic groups and Nigeria's huge diaspora gets a look-in as well. Justus D. Akeredolu Justus D Akeredolu's thorn carving (circa 1930s) Clara Etso Ugbodaga-Ngu Clara Etso Ugbodaga-Ngu's Elemu Yoruba Palm Wine Seller (1963) For all their differences, all the creatives represented have at least one thing in common, Bonsu says - ""fashioning radical visions of what modern art could be"". Nigerian Modernism runs at the Tate Modern from Wednesday until 10 May next year, and hopes to illuminate a movement that has long been underrepresented on the global stage. ""It comes with a message that we can take home,"" Onobrakpeya says. ""It gives us hope, it gives us strength, and we're going to work harder and we're going to produce something even greater than this.""

ded8eeae477b,How Stacey Solomon decluttered our homes back from the brink,,"How Stacey Solomon decluttered our homes back from the brink BBC Sheeny and Sohan were delighted by the transformation done by Stacey's team Has your home become messy without you even realising? Wanting the next best thing, holding on to things for sentimental reasons or just a lack of time to sort through your space can all mean you end up with too much stuff. Sort Your Life Out hosted by Stacey Solomon helps people declutter and shows the transformational impact that getting rid of things you don't need can have on your family and home. If you're struggling to clear items in your home, here are how three different families  who took part in the series managed it and the one key realisation that helped them do it. For more practical advice on how to clear your space click here I don't want my kids to buy things to feel good Sheeny Aphabhai-Heer lives with her partner Sohan, and children Milly, 22, Leila, 9 and Ethan, 4. The house is piled high with clothes, shoes, suitcases and kitchen equipment, meaning they have to eat separately at mealtimes as there isn't enough space to sit together. This lack of space also means it is a struggle for daughter Milly to work from home. Sheeny had Milly when she was 17 and in a difficult marriage. She managed to leave the marriage and buy her own house as a single mum. ""My mum's a superwoman, she's been through a lot in her life and she came out of there knowing she had to do her best and provide for me,"" says daughter Milly. When Sheeny started to earn money, she wanted things that she could be proud of, and the purchases increased from there. She says she often spends nights scrolling through shopping apps like Vinted, but wants to break this cycle for her kids. ""I noticed a growing trend in Milly and Leila. When something new is happening, they want a new outfit. ""That's my habit. Buying something new to feel good cannot be the legacy I give to my children."" By letting go of her clothes and shoes, Sheeny wants to be an example to her kids, showing that she can change and break the constant cycle of shopping. It was this realisation which enabled the Aphabhai-Heers' to get rid of just over 40% of their belongings. This meant Stacey Solomon and her team were able to transform the dining room with added desk space for Milly to work, and there was also enough space for the family to be able to eat meals together again. ""It's literally changed the dynamic of our family,"" says Sheeny. Giving away my wife's things didn't mean we'd forget her Craig (centre) and his two daughters Merywen and Wren with the Sort Your Life Out team. Craig Bufton is a single dad to two daughters, Wren, 4 and Merywen, 6. After Craig's wife Lois gave birth to Wren she was constantly exhausted. Eventually she was diagnosed with cancer, dying just eight months later. As a widowed father, the clutter built up as Craig focused on raising the girls as a single parent. He struggled to tackle the house as he couldn't face dealing with sentimental items tied to Lois, such as storybooks she wrote for the children, photos and a hoard of Christmas items she loved. ""There's just so much sentimental stuff and so many of our plans that aren't going to happen anymore."" His office also got out of control as paperwork piled up, and the living room ended up covered in toys and different hobby equipment. ""It took me a really long time to realise I was buying stuff to just get the dopamine hit out of it. So much of the stuff I have is 'oh this will make me happy' and it did for about 20 minutes."" Craig eventually decided to take action to create a house that was a special and relaxing place for his two daughters to grow up. The key to doing this was to let go of sentimental items tied to Lois. Stacey and her team encouraged Craig to focus on the items he was keeping because they had real meaning and memories, and not the things he was letting go of. One example is Lois' Christmas baubles, which Craig disliked. Rather than keep them all anyway, he held onto specific baubles for their daughters. Decluttering like this enabled him to downsize his office, creating a space for him to work downstairs instead. And in the place of his office they created a special reading room for the girls. This space meant Lois' love for stories and writing was kept alive, with her books on full display. The family now has the space to eat together, and a room where Craig can read Lois' storybooks to their children. Since this episode aired, Craig has found a new partner and has moved house with his daughters. Other stories you may enjoy Time with my kids was more important than crafting The Clarke family consists of mum Sarah, dad Jon, and children Timeon, 14, Owen, 9 and Caitlin, 11. Sarah is an avid crafts enthusiast, with an abundance of yarn, beads and other art materials in her home. Currently, her younger children, Owen and Caitlin,  share a room, and Sarah's crafts mean that a room that could be used for one of them can't be. The clutter of books, board games and toys in their house means making space for the family to sit and chat together is incredibly hard. Both Sarah and Jon are deaf, and mum Sarah finds making crafts a way for her to destress from everyday life. ""I like making things, it makes me feel good, creativity is therapeutic, it makes me calmer and relaxed."" ""My mum holds everything dear to her heart"" says Timeon. The team found an array of unfinished craft items all over the house, including an unfinished crochet bag from 15 years ago. Sarah feels a lot of guilt because she knew the time with her children was being impacted. ""I do lots with them but it doesn't stop the guilt being real."" Having the team come in helped her realise she had to prioritise time with the kids over her crafts. ""Children grow up faster, and my projects will always be there."" It was this realisation which helped her to let go of half of their items. Owen and Caitlin were able to have their own rooms, as Sarah's crafts were compacted into the living room in a large cupboard. After decluttering, Jon says there has been a massive improvement in their family life and now they are able to spend quality time together to sit and chat.

b1062b090128,Everything you need to know ahead of the Celebrity Traitors,,"Everything you need to know ahead of the Celebrity Traitors Steven McIntosh Entertainment reporter BBC The first series of the Celebrity Traitors kicks off later, with Sir Stephen Fry, Celia Imrie Alan Carr and Jonathan Ross among the contestants. Presenter Claudia Winkleman will welcome 19 famous faces to the Scottish highlands when the 70-minute opening episode launches at 21:00 BST. Charlotte Church, Kate Garraway, Paloma Faith and Tom Daley are among the other stars who will be sitting at the famous round table. Ahead of the launch, Winkleman told journalists: ""You think you know these people, and then you watch them play this game, and I was awestruck by the way they played it - with empathy, with wit and with real smarts."" It is the first celebrity version of the show, and will consist of nine hour-long episodes. The show has already made headlines for the starry cast it has attracted - with many viewers saying the line-up features bigger names than other celebrity TV series. ""I don't think there's ever been a reality show on television with a line-up like this,"" commented BBC Radio 2 breakfast host Scott Mills on Wednesday morning. As in previous years, the series will see three of the contestants assigned as ""traitors"", while the remaining ""faithful"" contestants must attempt to root them out. Who are the celebrity contestants? Singer Paloma Faith is among the celebrity contestants who will be sitting at the round table The contestants are: Alan Carr - Comedian Cat Burns – Singer/songwriter Celia Imrie – Actress Charlotte Church – Singer/activist Clare Balding - Broadcaster David Olusoga - Historian and filmmaker Joe Marler – Former England rugby union player Joe Wilkinson - Comedian Jonathan Ross - TV Presenter Kate Garraway - TV and radio presenter Lucy Beaumont - Comedian Mark Bonnar - Actor Nick Mohammed - Actor and comedian Niko Omilana - Online content creator Paloma Faith - Singer/songwriter Ruth Codd - Actress Stephen Fry - Actor and writer Tameka Empson – Actress and comedian Tom Daley – Olympian What is the prize? The celebrities will play for a cash prize of up to £100,000. The exact figure will depend on how they perform in missions throughout the series, where the money can go up or down. However, unlike the civilian version where the contestants keep the jackpot, the celebrities are playing for their chosen charity. But they will receive a separate appearance fee for taking part in the series. What can we expect from the series? The celebrities will be gradually murdered or banished as they attempt to root out the traitors The trailer for the Celebrity Traitors shows the celebrities expressing their excitement as they are driven to Ardross Castle in Inverness. But Winkleman soon tells them: ""I know out in the real world you're very important and successful, but here, there is no special treatment."" The teaser also shows the celebrities taking part in their first mission, and sitting at the round table for the first time, wearing their blindfolds. Looking ahead to the series, the stars also grapple with whether they will be chosen as traitors, or remain faithful. ""Maybe I have got a dark side,"" says Carr, while Sir Stephen adds: ""I don't know what beasts lie within me"". Imrie simply says: ""I'm here to win."" For the first time, comedian Ed Gamble will take the spin-off show Uncloaked on location to the castle, to interview celebrities as soon as they leave. Ahead of the series, Winkleman said: ""We're incredibly lucky these brilliant people have said yes. I'd love to say we'll take it easy on them and they'll just wander round the castle and eat toast for a couple of weeks but that would be a lie."" Series three winner Leanne Quigley told BBC Breakfast on Wednesday: ""What's going to be so interesting about the celebrity version is they're going in with a reputation, they're all going to know each other. ""They know what it's like to have cameras around them all the time, whereas we didn't, so they're going to know how to be on TV. ""So it's going to be interesting to see if they immerse themselves in the game, because I know for certain it's really difficult not to get involved and emotional, and play the game wholeheartedly."" What have the contestants said? Singer Cat Burns said she was ""really intrigued"" to find out how she'd cope in the castle The celebrities haven't done many interviews ahead of the series launch, but here are what a few of them said in their Q&As on the BBC website . Discussing her reasons for taking part, presenter Claire Balding said: ""I really find it fascinating, the way group thinking can be influenced. I don't know whether I can resist that or whether I can influence that and I'm kind of interested in it from a psychological perspective."" Asked if she'd be good at finding traitors, comedian Lucy Beaumont joked: ""When I was a teenager, I was good at spotting 15-year-old boys that were lying but things have changed since then. I hope the skills might return in this game."" Singer Cat Burns commented she has ""always been really intrigued to see if I would, one, be able to work out who the Traitors are, and two, if I was a Traitor, if I would be able to keep up the mystery of it"". Actor Mark Bonnar said he was hoping to be a faithful. ""I think that the added pressure of being a Traitor, just keeping that facade up the whole time, would be incredibly exhausting and quite stressful,"" he said. Singer Charlotte Church, meanwhile, said she didn't have a game plan. ""I'm going to read the field, moment by moment and be present. If you're able to stay present and be really open to your sensory portals - your ears, your eyes, even your spidey senses, then I think that you're able to be much more present.""

d9a379defc64,TikTok or bust? Tories try to work out how to win younger voters,,"TikTok or bust? Tories try to work out how to win younger voters Kate Whannel Political reporter Getty Images Among the many questions Conservatives members at the party conference in Manchester are asking themselves: how they can win the support of young people? Conservative members and voters have always skewed older than other parties, but now it is more pronounced. Pollster Luke Tryl, from More in Common, told a Tory conference fringe meeting: ""At the last election the average age someone started voting Conservative was in their 60s. It's now even later. ""The Conservatives are basically only being kept afloat in the polls at the moment by the over 75 age category. Obviously, for demographic reasons, that is not a sustainable place to be."" At another event, pollster Jonathan Jones of JL Partners began his presentation on the attitudes of voters under 40 with the ominous words: ""Conservative Party members turn away now."" One Young Conservative sought to offer some good news by telling the event that at Keele University the Conservative Society now had the biggest membership in a decade. He paused to allow for some impressed noises from the audience before adding: ""We now have 11 members."" With 16-year-olds likely to get the vote at the next election, the problem could become yet more acute. ""The party has been a bit lazy on this,"" says shadow housing minister Paul Holmes. ""We need to pull our finger out of our bums."" But what - if anything - can Conservatives do to fix the problem? Beware the Millennial Pause ""We need to be where the voters are,"" says Luke Evans a Conservative MP, shadow minister and keen Tik-Toker. He says his colleagues should be embracing the social media platform more but warns colleagues to avoid the ""Millennial Pause"" - the two-second gap the older generation leave at the beginning of videos before starting to talk. ""That's the biggest turn off,"" he says. At another event, one audience member said the party needed to copy the approach of American right-wing online influencers. They suggested that the Conservatives should run a campaign encouraging young people to send in stories of left-wing behaviour that they argue could be mocked online - for example, a teacher calling Winston Churchill a fascist or a classmate identifying as a cat. Blake Stephenson, the MP for Mid Bedfordshire, agrees that Conservatives had to ""communicate in a way they want to consume the information"". ""Unfortunately, we live in a world where anything beyond 10 or 15 seconds is just sort of too much for people and they just scroll up. ""At this conference we're talking about very complicated policy areas... and we're saying quite rightly that the solutions are not easy. ""If anyone tells you that the solutions to any of these complicated problems are easy, then they are sort of sending you up the river. ""But yet we need to project complicated responses and answers to complicated questions in 20 seconds."" 'A stake in society' Former minister and former Conservative leadership contender Tom Tugendhat says young people were not ""drifting away from the centre"" but ""drifting away from what doesn't work for them"". Young people were ""realising the entire economy is now geared towards a bunch of people who are aging,"" he says. ""They are not stupid - they are choosing parties that are revolutionary."" Fred Lynam from the Young Conservatives says the party has a ""difficult hill to climb – even more difficult with young voters"". ""The way it will happen is by giving young people a stake in society – then they will feel like they have got something to conserve. ""That is why they are flocking to Your Party, the Greens and Reform because they are arguing that we need to tear it down, because it is not working."" Several panellists at conference events say that offering policies that made it easier for young people to buy a home would help. Shadow chancellor Mel Stride has announced that the Conservatives would give young people a £5,000 tax rebate in their first job, in a bid to help them buy their first home; and in her keynote speech, Kemi Badenoch promised a Conservative government would scrap stamp duty on homes. At the beginning of conference, Badenoch said Conservatives needed to ""face up"" to what they got wrong, pointing to the rise in small boats crossings and - without mentioning her by name - Liz Truss's mini budget as examples. But some at conference have argued that too much hand-wringing could blur the Conservatives message to young people. ""By the next election there will be voters who haven't experienced a Conservative government in their adult life so that need for contrition is probably less,"" says Lynam. Blake Stephenson says that during the 2024 election campaign he had experienced a lot of anger from voters and that ""humility is important"". ""How long will the blood letting take. I don't know. I hope fairly quickly."" ""The facts of life are Conservative"" is a quote from former PM Margaret Thatcher which has been trotted out at fringe events. It reflects a sense among some at conference that voters in the younger demographic will inevitably turn to the Conservatives, because their arguments will be proved right in time - particularly if, as some delegates predict, there will be an economic crisis in the next few years. Rebecca Paul says young people have ""bad associations"" with the last Conservative government which ""tried to keep everyone happy and ended up with a mishmash of policies"". She says Badenoch wouldn't make the same mistakes. ""She is honest. She will tell you things you don't want to hear. ""We need to come up with sensible policies. People will in time start listening to us. ""Tough gig but we're going to be back."" Julian Ellacott, chair of the Conservative's National Convention, told one fringe event the research suggested it would take two years before voters of all ages started listening to the Conservatives again. ""The answer is - who knows. We have to stick to our job, focus on our own game. ""It will take as long as it takes but we mustn't be like magpies and get distracted by shiny things. ""We need to get the core things right.""

During her speech at the Conservative party conference in Manchester, Badenoch said: ""At the heart of a Conservative Britain is a country where people who wish to own their first home, can... but our housing market is not working as it should.""

In a press release, the party specified that this will related only to primary residences irrespective of the price.

It will not apply to any additional homes, properties purchased by companies, or by non-UK residents.

Stamp duty is paid by someone purchasing a home in England and Northern Ireland - it begins on property costing £125,000, or £300,000 if it's your first home.

526905a3ce11,"Conservatives would scrap stamp duty, Badenoch announces",,"Conservatives would scrap stamp duty, Badenoch announces Brian Wheeler Political reporter Standing ovation as Badenoch says Tories would scrap stamp duty The next Conservative government would abolish stamp duty on the sale of main homes, Kemi Badenoch has said, in a surprise announcement at the end of her first conference speech as party leader. Badenoch received a standing ovation from Tory activists in Manchester as she declared: ""That is how we will help achieve the dream of home ownership for millions."" She said scrapping stamp duty - a tax on the sale of homes in England and Northern Ireland - will ""unlock a fairer and more aspirational society"" and help people of all ages. It came after a speech packed with new policies aimed at grabbing political attention and setting out clear dividing lines with her opponents. Badenoch was under pressure to deliver the speech of her political career, to end speculation that she will face a leadership challenge, as her party continues to trail Labour and Reform UK in the polls. Her 45 minute address was peppered with jokes and personal stories and went down well in the hall, where - in contrast to some of the other speeches this week - there was standing room only. And in a clear break with the leaders' speeches at the Labour and Liberal Democrat conferences, she only mentioned Reform twice. Instead, she concentrated her fire on Labour, accusing Sir Keir Starmer of leading a  ""weak and directionless"" government, which was making ""one hell of a mess"" of the country. Her announcement on stamp duty was kept under wraps until she delivered it, telling the Tory faithful: ""Stamp duty is a bad tax. ""We must free up our housing market, because a society where no one can afford to buy or move is a society where social mobility is dead."" Stamp duty is paid by people buying homes for more than £125,000 - but first time buyers are exempt from it on properties worth up to £300,000. Those buying homes worth more pay a percentage of the value of the home. Chancellor Rachel Reeves was reported to be considering scrapping stamp duty in her November Budget, although Badenoch claimed it would be significantly increased. Stamp duty brought in an estimated £13.9bn in the last financial year, but a large proportion of this is from additional homes and other buildings. The Institute for Fiscal Studies has estimated that abolishing stamp duty on primary residences will cost around £4.5bn. The Conservatives said they had ""cautiously"" estimated that the policy would cost £9bn. Badenoch insisted she could meet this promise, with the money to come from some of the £47bn in planned savings from the welfare budget and foreign aid, announced earlier this week. Under the Tory plans, stamp duty will be abolished entirely on ""primary residences"" and will not apply to ""additional properties, properties purchased by companies, or by non-UK residents"". Stamp duty does not apply in Scotland and Wales, which have separate property taxes. The Welsh Conservatives have said they will replicate the cut if they win power in May's elections. In her conference speech, Badenoch claimed the Conservative Party was ""fizzing with ideas"" to fix the ""broken model"" she said was holding the country back. She pledged to scrap a string of government policies - from new employment rights to VAT on private school fees. And she ran through some of the big policy announcements the party has made this week, including: Her promise to end the ""family farm tax"" got a big cheer in the hall, and her proposals to slash welfare spending and take the UK out of the European Convention on Human Rights also went down well. In a sustained attack on the Labour government, she said: ""All they have delivered is a doom loop of higher taxes, weaker borders, and month after month of chaos. ""They had a plan to win, but no plan for power. ""No vision for Britain. They know how to make promises, but not how to deliver them."" Acknowledging the Conservatives' dire opinion poll ratings and recent local election losses, she said voters were ""still angry"" with her party. And in a swipe at Reform, she said this had led to ""parties that in normal times would never be seen as a serious option for government are gaining ground, making promises they will never be able to keep"". But the speech was chiefly aimed at emphasising that the Conservative Party is under new leadership - one that was prepared to make the ""bold"" and ""tough"" decisions that her opponents would not.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c20zv94ldpko,politics,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/3560/live/3eedd230-a444-11f0-928c-71dbb8619e94.jpg,2025-10-08T13:11:28.238000+00:00,88d24db0320aadcf6f05ad8bbd042eecea28a0d7
1be69e4b2f5a,Badenoch hopes to grab attention with policy blitz,,"The country's most successful political party, when it comes to winning elections, finds itself in a position as dire as it is unprecedented. They were crushed in a general election and have gone backwards since. The Conservatives' opinion poll ratings are desperate. Kemi Badenoch's position as leader remains perilous because of this. But there's been a concerted effort over the last few days here at the Conservative Party conference to give the party something to talk about, in other words: a blitz of policy. And from one or two conversations I've had after her speech, including from some internal sceptics, ""pleasant surprise"" is a recurring theme. In Badenoch's first keynote speech to the conference, there was one big reveal. They were so excited about it that they didn't tell us in advance. It was new to us, and to many in the party too: the abolition of stamp duty on main homes in England and Northern Ireland. Put alongside proposed savings of £47bn, the Conservatives think this amounts to claiming back the mantle of economic responsibility in a way that ordinary households can notice. But the key thing here is that yes, the party has given itself something to talk about, but is anyone listening? As a new leader, Badenoch did not want to rush into announcing policies. Partly out of an authentic belief that you've got to think things through before you announce them, so she talked about policies, not announcements, detail, not just headlines. But the perpetual challenge for an opposition party, is that if you announce policies too soon, either they get nicked or time overtakes them - and you end up ditching them before you get into power, and are able to implement them. What I've noticed this week is there's a Darwinian selection about the people who have come to the conference in Manchester. Yes, the numbers were down on where they were a few years ago as you'd expect. But those who've turned up are up for the fight. There's a definite desire for the Conservatives to find some clear blue water, particularly on the economic agenda. And there's some polling evidence to suggest despite all the rows, on the legacy of Liz Truss and her mini-budget, that there is a well of support on their economic prospectus that they might be able to build on. And one more fascinating thing – this was all framed around a conversation about the Conservatives or Labour. There was barely references to Reform and Nigel Farage. Badenoch will hope her speech buys her some time and some attention. In our noisy political ecosystem, neither is guaranteed.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cwywrpelp7jo,politics,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/2d35/live/61d744e0-a442-11f0-b741-177e3e2c2fc7.jpg,2025-10-08T15:00:53.742000+00:00,1a6d846d44b9cd026d991196fdf63437da8dea03
9103f74b912d,Big Brother contestant removed over 'unacceptable language',,"A Big Brother contestant has been removed from the reality show for the ""repeated use of unacceptable language and behaviour"", ITV has said. George Gilbert had received warnings earlier in the series and was seen in Monday's episode being reprimanded by Big Brother for mocking a fellow housemate. A spokesperson for the show said: ""Following repeated use of unacceptable language and behaviour, George has been removed from the Big Brother House with immediate effect and will no longer participate in the programme."" Gilbert's latest comments will not be aired because they are contrary to broadcast standards, ITV said. The 23-year-old actor-turned-parish councillor from Braintree, Essex, had previously received warnings for unacceptable language. It's understood that most were not broadcast. However, Monday's episode showed Gilbert being reprimanded by Big Brother for imitating another housemate during a game of Truth or Dare. Big Brother referred to one moment in the game when he was asked about his least favourite qualities of other housemates. ""You then went on to mimic Sam using both noises that mocked the way Sam talks and body language that included limp wrists,"" Big Brother said. ""Do you understand how both your language and behaviour could be offensive to Sam, your housemates and the viewing public?"" Gilbert replied: ""We did have a conversation about this, I have apologised, I don't want to make anyone feel like that."" Big Brother then confirmed it was issuing him with a formal warning, and said rules regarding language and behaviour are explained to all housemates before entering. ITV has also said housemates receive training in respect, dignity and inclusion. Gilbert was one of the contestants who was up for eviction this week, alongside Elsa, Cameron and Richard.

5ab60a4aec65,Lenny Henry calls for reparations for black British people,,"Lenny Henry calls for reparations for black British people Paul Glynn Culture reporter Getty Images Sir Lenny Henry has called for the payment of slavery reparations to all black British people. Writing in a new book titled The Big Payback, the comedian supports the case for the UK government to give £18 trillion in compensatory payments. In the book, which has been quoted by the Telegraph, Sir Lenny writes: ""All black British people... need reparations for slavery,"" adding that ""we personally deserve money for the effects of slavery"". Reparations are measures to make amends for past actions deemed wrong or unfair, and can range from the financial to symbolic. 'Ridding the world of racism' Speaking to the Guardian last month , Marcus Ryder, co-writer of Sir Lenny's book, said if Britain starts making reparations, ""it would change the relationship and the dynamic it has with Africa, with India, the Caribbean, with lots of different emerging world powers."" He continued: ""It will benefit trade and the British economy if we have better relationships with all these countries."" Their new book declares that reparation payments can and should help with ""ridding the world of racism"". Sir Lenny argues that black British people are ""twice as likely to be unemployed as their white counterparts"" and ""grossly over-represented in the prison population"", he says, ""all because of the transatlantic slave trade"". Speaking to the Guardian alongside Ryder, Sir Lenny added: ""These things take time. Look how long it took to abolish slavery. Look how long it took to pay for slave owners' loss of work and earnings. ""This is to try and push the dial so that the conversation begins that might lead to something, and that might take, very optimistically, another 100 years, another 150 years. We start the conversation so we can get on with it."" The UK's history of slavery dates back to before the Roman Times, but its involvement in the large-scale transatlantic slave trade, transporting millions of African people to the Americas, began in around the 16th Century. It was ultimately abolished, but in stages. Full emancipation for enslaved people in the British Empire, excluding some exceptions like the East India Company, was granted by the Slavery Abolition Act of 1833. Sir Lenny Henry was born In Birmingham to Jamaican parents who had immigrated to the UK. The comedian and actor, who co-founded Comic Relief in 1985, was knighted by the late Queen Elizabeth II in 2015 for services to drama and charity. Then in 2021, he co-curated a Guardian special called Black British culture matters, alongside Marcus Ryder. He went on to write Three Little Birds, a six-part drama series based his mother's Windrush experience.

52bb83c21119,King Charles hopes nature film will 'inspire' viewers,,"King Charles hopes nature film will 'inspire' viewers Sean Coughlan Royal correspondent Millie Pilkington/ King's Foundation King Charles held a ""harmony summit"" at Highgrove in the summer, where this photograph was taken King Charles says he wants to inspire a ""sense of determination"" to protect the environment, as details are announced of a TV documentary in which he will explain his philosophy of ""harmony"" and the need ""to work with rather than against nature"". The King's Foundation says the feature-length TV film, provisionally titled Finding Harmony: A King's Vision, will be screened on Amazon's Prime Video early next year. ""Never has it been more important for the world to make a concerted effort to protect and prioritise our planet, and to restore our relationship with it,"" the monarch said about the project. In the film the King will reflect on his own decades of campaigning for sustainability. The King said it was his ""fondest hope that this film may encourage a new audience to learn about the philosophy of Harmony - and perhaps inspire the same sense of determination it has given me to help build a more sustainable future."" The King has appeared in a behind-the-scenes BBC film about the Coronation, but this will be a more unusual approach in looking at his beliefs. ""For much of my life I have sought to promote and encourage ways we can work with, rather than against nature. In other words, to restore balance to our planet which is under such stress,"" said the King. The one-off documentary will show how he believes humans are ""part of nature, not apart from nature"" and that a healthy connection with nature is at ""the core of human wellbeing"". With examples from around the world, the documentary will show how the philosophy of harmony can be applied to agriculture, traditional craft skills, architecture and town planning. ""This film will, I hope, demonstrate just some of the remarkable work being done around the world to put harmony into practice, from the forests of Guyana to sustainable communities in India – and, closer to home, through the work of my King's Foundation at Dumfries House and Highgrove,"" said the King. King's Foundation The King heard from Indigenous peoples about the importance of living with nature Director Nicolas Brown said there was a gap in knowledge about how the King's views on harmony had shaped his work. ""Remarkably few people around the world know the full depth of the King's lifelong battle to bring nature and humanity into harmony,"" he said. Their cameras recorded the King's first harmony summit, held at Highgrove in Gloucestershire in July. This brought together leaders of Indigenous people from around the world who shared their knowledge of how communities can live in tune with the natural world. Along with the King, they performed a fire ceremony at the start of the day, paying their respects to nature. The King's views on harmony and the design of towns have also influenced thinking about creating a new generation of new towns in England . With his Amazon documentary, the King will be the latest royal to appear on a streaming service. Prince William recently faced questions from Eugene Levy on Apple TV+ and Prince Harry and Meghan were in a Netflix series about their departure from royal life. They have provided platforms for the royals to share their thoughts and opinions, but without a conventional interview format. Kristina Murrin, chief executive of the King's Foundation, said the documentary would show the decades of the King's commitment to harmony, in a way that was ""both moving and inspiring to see that journey committed to film"".",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cd63dxxv9jpo,entertainment,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/f200/live/8e426b80-a44d-11f0-8a21-ff96e44d1cc2.jpg,2025-10-08T21:02:22.730000+00:00,0c21b2e4520bb498c4b627d2ef0780217eccbffd
0f862a5c6c94,"Stars, secrets and slip-ups: Celebrity Traitors is off to a cracking start",,"Stars, secrets and slip-ups: Celebrity Traitors is off to a cracking start Steven McIntosh Entertainment reporter Spoiler warning: This article reveals details from the first episode of The Celebrity Traitors Host Claudia Winkleman said she was initially reluctant to do a celebrity version of the series TV shows with famous contestants usually have a loose definition of the word ""celebrity"". But there are no recycled Love Islanders among the 19 stars in the first series of The Celebrity Traitors, which has got off to a cracking start. ""When they came to me and said they wanted to do a celebrity version, I said, 'Oh I don't think we should do that, I like just doing it non-celeb',"" said host Claudia Winkleman at the show's launch, only half joking. ""Thankfully I have absolutely zero power, because they said, 'Well, these are the people who have expressed interest.' And I couldn't believe it."" Granted, it's worth keeping things in perspective. It's not Taylor Swift and Tom Cruise entering Ardross Castle in Inverness. But frankly, if Kate Garraway is on board, so are we. The ITV daytime star was joined by Jonathan Ross, Celia Imrie, Sir Stephen Fry and other familiar names as the series got under way on Wednesday. Here are six highlights from the opening episode. 1. The celebrities want to make each other laugh As you'd expect, the celebrities are extremely comfortable in front of the cameras,  creating a fun new dynamic and giving the show a new lease of life. Many of them already knew each other and had an immediate confidence that the regular contestants don't. All of them evidently know and love the format, and there were some genuinely funny moments as the stars tried to make each other laugh. ""What was your name again?"" joked singer Paloma Faith (a faithful, appropriately) as she introduced herself to her fellow players in the car ""I'm worse than Linda!"" remarked comedian Alan Carr later, referencing the notoriously awful but lovable traitor from series three When TV presenter Clare Balding pointed out that banishments are decided by a vote, Carr told her: ""God, you're looking beautiful today"" Later, Faith brilliantly pretended to drop dead on the round table after drinking an apparently poisoned glass of water just after the traitors had been selected The stars were even happy to make jokes about being traitors. As they left the round table, Sir Stephen shouted: ""Traitors stay behind please!"", while Ross commented later: ""See you in the turret!"" 2. Alan Carr is extremely good value ""You know what celebrities are like: two-faced!"" said Carr during the episode Making the comedian a traitor was exactly the kind of brilliant casting decision we were hoping for. (""How could you not?"" said Claudia.) In the first episode, Carr was panicked, sweating and generally squirming over being a traitor. ""I feel sick,"" he said. ""It's the worst secret ever and it's just burning me, I'm so nervous."" He is a delight to watch - even just the sight of him strolling the corridors with his hood up trying to look menacing makes you laugh. ""I've had to have my cloak taken out because I'm so fat,"" he joked in the first traitors' meeting in the turret. The traitors were completed by chat show host Ross and singer Cat Burns - both of whom seem to have more of the conniving mindset needed for a great traitor. But Carr is the truly inspired choice. ""My aim was to go under the radar, and I think I've pole-vaulted over it,"" he reflected at one point. We're in for some fantastic memes. 3. The celebrities literally dig their own graves Instead of the traditional arrival by train, the stars were driven to a graveyard and set an opening challenge that saw them dig through soil in search of six available shields. The lucky recipients included Ross, Garraway, rugby player Joe Marler, comedian Joe Wilkinson and singer Charlotte Church. The sixth shield finder was actress Celia Imrie - albeit helped by Ted Lasso star Nick Mohammed. ""My aim was to try and get Celia a shield, because I love her,"" he explained. But this is exactly the sort of kindness that can make people suspicious in this show, so he'd better tread carefully. Messing with the format isn't always a success - who can forget the disastrous ""Seer"" twist that ruined the climax of the last series? - but this was a terrific new task, especially Carr's disappointment that the shield he thought he'd found was actually a rock. 4. Clare Balding is a liability in missions The contestants were challenged to pull a giant Trojan horse up a hill and through a series of gates that each required a special code, before eventually setting the horse alight. Unfortunately, Balding locked in an incorrect combination at the first gate before the contestants had even begun tackling the puzzle, not realising you only got one chance to enter the code. ""No! I didn't realise I locked it in, sorry!"" she shouted. ""I've made a complete mistake there."" She explained later: ""I thought, oh we can guess lots of numbers, so while they're working that out, I'll just stick a number in."" ""I would've done exactly the same,"" sympathised Winkleman. ""She was mortified, she really was, so I felt terrible for her."" The mission raised a few eyebrows - some were suspicious that Church gave up her shield so willingly in exchange for Balding's error, while swimmer Tom Daley suspected Balding might have deliberately sabotaged the task because she's a traitor. Luckily, the rest of the task went well, partly thanks to Mohammed, who Garraway described as a ""puzzle ninja"". Ultimately the contestants completed the mission, would you believe it, with just moments to spare. 5. It's a whole new ball game with celebrities Some fans were nervous about the celebrity spin-off, but the bottom line is: it works. ""It's not often in our sheltered world that we are put in a position where we have no idea how we're going to react,"" noted Sir Stephen. ""I don't want to incriminate myself, but I've always wanted to murder a celebrity,"" added Ross. But in some ways, the fact that the contestants are well-known makes strategising harder. ""I was thinking about going in speaking Welsh and pretending I've actually been Welsh all this time. Sort of a reverse of Charlotte,"" joked comedian Lucy Beaumont, referring to the last traitor standing in series three. The celebrities are playing for a £100,000 prize for their chosen charity (although they also receive a separate appearance fee). ""You think you know these people,"" Winkleman reflected, ""and then you watch them play this game, and I was awestruck by the way they played it - with empathy, with wit and with real smarts."" 6. The cliffhanger is unbearable Despite its extended running time, the episode ended without a murder or a banishment, leaving us with a huge number of questions. We didn't find out if the celebrities are any better than previous contestants at spelling each other's names at the round table, or whether there will be another outbreak of players telling each other: ""I'm voting for yourself."" But we know there will be drama. ""Did the roundtables get heated? Yes,"" said Winkleman. ""They're polite, but they want to catch the traitors, and the traitors want to remain undetected, and both parties are excellent at what they do."" Sir Stephen's total dismissal of the ""gut instinct"" tactic was particularly refreshing. ""The idea that you can be good at reading people is absolute nonsense, and it's just like astrology or anything else,"" he said before heading into the castle. ""Woo woo. You just can't do it. ""We can all be convinced, even though the facts tell us otherwise. These notions of 'I just knew, it's the way he lifted his glass, his eye doing that thing' – all nonsense."" As the episode drew to a close, the most pressing question was which star would be murdered by Carr in plain sight. ""I can't believe they've left me to it,"" he said. ""I have people I want to kill, but it's not going to be easy. What am I going to do?"" We can't wait to find out.

3934ae44d85f,Liberal Democrat membership has halved in 5 years,,"Liberal Democrat membership has halved in 5 years Helen Catt Political correspondent Getty Images The number of Liberal Democrat party members has almost halved in the last five years, according to BBC analysis of available figures. The figure has fallen from just under 118,000 in 2020, when Sir Ed Davey became leader, to 60,000. That is despite the Lib Dems having their most successful general election ever last year in terms of seats won. A party spokesperson said ""in actual elections, more and more people are backing the Liberal Democrats"". It comes as the Green Party of England and Wales says it now has 90,000 members, a 91% increase on 2020 figures. The Liberal Democrats saw a significant boost in membership in the run-up to Brexit in 2020, when the party was campaigning for a second referendum. The drop in paid-up members since then has been masked by the inclusion of ""registered supporters"" in figures published in the party's annual accounts each year since 2017. Registered supporters sign up for free to get access to briefings and events, but they cannot decide policy or vote in leadership elections. The party clearly states the figure published in the annual accounts relates to both member and supporters. However, it does not provide a breakdown. 'Public profile' Prof Tim Bale leads the Party Membership Project, a joint project between Queen Mary University of London and Sussex University. He said the drop in membership was surprising given the Lib Dems' electoral success, which would suggest ""a party on the up, in which case you might get more ambitious people wanting to join it"". But he added: ""There's an extent to which surges into parties are prompted by public profile... and they don't seem to have much chance of getting into government at the moment."" In more positive news for the Lib Dems, he said research carried out by his project after the 2024 election showed that the Liberal Democrats were the most active of all the memberships of the political parties. Figures collected showed that a greater proportion of Lib Dem members (19%) had canvassed voters face-to-face or over the phone than any other party. Prof Bale said there was ""all sorts of research over time that, certainly in very close races, contact with the voters, whether that be face to face or just leafletting does seem to make a difference"". A Liberal Democrat spokesperson said: ""We have a record number of MPs, the most popular party leader in the country, and elected more councillors than Labour or the Conservatives for the first time ever in May's local elections. ""When it comes to actual elections, more and more people are backing the Liberal Democrats as the only party that can stop Reform turning Trump's America into Farage's Britain."" Other parties Working out how many members a political party has can be tricky. There is no legal obligation for political parties to publish their membership figures, so they tend to only be revealed in annual accounts or when a party holds a leadership election. Labour, which is the largest political party in the UK on current publicly available figures, has seen a drop in membership of 37% since 2020. Latest published figures put its membership at 333,235 at the end of last year, although reports have suggested it may have fallen further to 309,000. An updated figure should be given by Labour later this month, when the winner of its deputy leadership contest is announced. Reform UK did not give a figure for membership in its annual accounts last year, but a ticker on its website says it has just under 260,000 members. The Green Party of England and Wales has seen a rapid surge in membership and now says its has 90,000 members, which is a 54% rise on last year's figure of 58,322 in December. The Conservatives do not routinely publish their membership figures, but 131,680 people were eligible to vote in last year's Tory leadership election, which is 40,000 fewer than in the 2022 contest. Party membership figures are not verified by outside bodies. Where we got our figures The figure that has been most recently used for the current size of the Lib Dems is 83,174, which was the figure for December 2024 that appears in the party's annual accounts, including both members and registered supporters. As the freelance journalist Adam Ramsay has pointed out, the figure for paid-up members is given elsewhere, in a statement for the party treasurer in the accounts for the Liberal Democrats in England . It says there was an ""overall membership of 60K"", with 55,000 - or 92% of them - in England, and supporter levels that ""remain constant at over 20K"". To get the membership figure for 2020, we looked to the number of ballot papers issued in the leadership election, as only full members can vote. At the time, the party said it had issued 117,924, papers, which was its highest ever number.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy5069p70x2o,politics,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/2fa8/live/4ac8fe20-a45f-11f0-a789-358ea6d9d143.png,2025-10-09T01:13:34.391000+00:00,686e1a8729e5033c76cfd3d7c632471b9b52762f
9c41a7feac6d,How Britain's membership of the ECHR became a political hot potato,,"How Britain's membership of the ECHR became a political hot potato Dominic Casciani Home and Legal Correspondent BBC Last week Kemi Badenoch announced that the Conservative Party would take the UK out of the European Convention of Human Rights if they won the next election. ""I have not come to this decision lightly,"" the Tory leader said. ""But it is clear that it is necessary to protect our borders, our veterans, and our citizens."" Her words came on the eve of the party's annual conference, at a time when the Conservatives are under enormous pressure from Reform UK. Nigel Farage's party also wants out of the ECHR, as well as other international treaties that he thinks stand in the way of curbing illegal immigration. Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey, meanwhile, has been just as strident the other way. ""Kemi Badenoch has chosen to back Nigel Farage and join Vladimir Putin,"" he declared - adding ""this will do nothing to stop the boats or fix our broken immigration system"". EPA Kemi Badenoch pledged to pull out if the Conservatives win the election, but there are many unanswered questions about the consequences Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has weighed in, though he hovers somewhere in between. He told the BBC he does not want to ""tear down"" human rights laws, but backs changing how international law is interpreted to stop unsuccessful asylum seekers blocking their deportation. But while strongly-worded opinions over whether or not to pull out of the treaty make for easy headlines, the consequences are deeply complicated. Even Badenoch acknowledged last year that leaving would not be a ""silver bullet"" for tackling immigration. So how is it that such a nuanced issue has been reduced to a political hot potato? Dodging political bullets It was back in 2011 - not far into David Cameron's tenure as prime minister - that this issue came to the forefront of domestic politics. It centred around the case of John Hirst, a man convicted of manslaughter, who argued the UK's blanket ban on prisoners voting in any circumstances was a breach of human rights. In 2005 Strasbourg had ruled in his favour. It essentially said the UK's policy was too black and white. Cameron's Labour predecessors Tony Blair and Gordon Brown dodged the political bullet of being seen to give in to the court. But when the relatively new Tory PM said he felt ""physically ill"" at the prospect of giving jailed criminals the vote, his soundbite propelled the ECHR to the heart of public consciousness. Getty Images David Cameron said he felt ""physically ill"" at the prospect of giving jailed criminals the vote The ECHR had been largely drafted by a British team and aimed to impose on post-fascist Europe a ""never-again"" package of legal rights. Its content drew heavily on historic laws - for example the concept of Habeas Corpus (banning unlawful detention), can be seen in the ECHR's Article 5. Officially, the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg polices those rights. And when it rules that a country is in breach, the member states come together to find a way of fixing the problem in the Council of Europe (nothing to do with the EU). But in the UK, there is also the Human Rights Act, which means ECHR cases can be dealt with by its own judges. Disputes between UK courts and Strasbourg can be worked through too - what happened following the John Hirst case is testament to this. In 2017, ministers allowed offenders who had been released on licence the right to vote - but made clear that Parliament would never allow votes for criminals still in prison cells. The Council of Europe closed the case. And just weeks ago the Strasbourg court threw out a fresh attempt by a prisoner to re-open the issue. Yet it was the original clash, together with Cameron's comments in 2011, that stuck in many minds. PA Media Starmer does not want to ""tear down"" human rights laws, but backs changing certain aspects around how international law is interpreted Adding fuel to the fire that same year, Theresa May - home secretary at the time - shared a story during party conference about a Bolivian man who avoided deportation because of his pet cat. This illustrated the problem with human rights laws, she argued. Only the story, as May told it, wasn't entirely correct , according to England's top judges. The Home Office indeed wanted to send the man home as an illegal immigrant. And the cat - called Maya - had featured in the man's appeal. But that was only a tiny part of the detailed evidence he provided. A spokesperson for the Judicial Office at the Royal Courts of Justice, which issues statements on behalf of senior judges, said at the time that the cat was ""nothing to do with"" the eventual judgement, which allowed the man to stay. Yet the pet became a source of unintentional humour - and when a judge cracked a joke about the cat no longer needing to fear adapting to Bolivian mice, the case took on a life of its own. By that autumn, a mood had begun to take hold about human rights that, 14 years later, has culminated in the Conservatives pledging to leave the ECHR. 'Open-ended and obscure obligations' Richard Ekins KC, a professor at the University of Oxford, is a staunch critic of the ECHR on the basis that membership in his view compromises UK sovereignty. ""But there is a more fundamental problem,"" he argues. ""And the fundamental problem can be observed by paying attention to what the court has been doing, which really is quite openly to expand the Convention's reach over time."" He references a case last year, where the court ruled that Switzerland had breached human rights by failing to tackle climate change. The incredibly complex judgement was celebrated by campaigners as a game-changer - but a British judge, Tim Eicke KC, said the majority on the panel had ""gone beyond what it is legitimate and permissible for this court to do"". Getty Images The European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg polices those rights set out in the convention ""The judgment… imposes very far reaching, but also open ended and obscure obligations on member states,"" argues Prof Ekins. ""Domestic courts are going to be invited to apply the European Court's new approach to discipline, supervise [and] control climate policy, which obviously is a highly complicated and tangled set of considerations that intersect with social policy, economic policy, foreign policy."" This is the heart of his argument: a court completely divorced from the political will of the British people is now making the UK do things that are far beyond its original remit. ""It's incompatible - its intention at least - with parliamentary democracy,"" he argues. Hijacked by the immigration debate Nowhere is the allegation of overreach stronger in British politics than in Reform's claim that the ECHR is to blame for problems with the UK's migration system. Yet the evidence supporting this claim is often anecdotal and complex - as was the case with Maya the cat. A study of media stories about the ECHR by the University of Oxford's Bonavero Institute for Human Rights found that fewer than 1% of all foreign criminals who have appealed against their deportation in the UK have won their case on human rights grounds. When cases went as far as Strasbourg, the court tended to throw them out. PA Media Reform's claim that the ECHR is to blame for problems with the UK's migration system is based on evidence that is often anecdotal and complex That's not to say there are no issues at all. Lord Jonathan Sumption, the former Supreme Court judge, believes that some decisions by immigration tribunal judges have become ""extravagant"" and far removed from the original boundaries of the right to family life. ""I have no problem about the text of the Convention,"" he says. ""I do have a problem about the unlimited expansion which it's undergone at the hands of the Strasbourg Court. ""It's unfortunate that the whole issue has been hijacked by the question of immigration. ""I think that it will make some difference to the ability to keep people out or deport them if we are not members of the ECHR. But I think the extent that it will make a difference is not widely understood - and has been greatly exaggerated."" Would leaving the ECHR 'stop the boats'? So, would leaving the ECHR really ""stop the boats"", to use Rishi Sunak's phrase? ""The number one problem about deporting illegal immigrants, first of all, is finding a place which will take them and which is not unsafe,"" argues Lord Sumption. ""And secondly, [there is] the Refugee Convention. It doesn't require us to take in asylum seekers. It does require us to adjudicate on their claims and give them certain rights once they've got here, even if they got here illegally. ""The ECHR is certainly an additional difficulty, but not as great a difficulty, as is suggested."" Getty Images Lord Sumption: 'I think the extent that [it would] make a difference has been greatly exaggerated' The UK government has already promised to devise clearer and stricter rules that will tell immigration officials and judges how to interpret the right to family life. ""I think it is a runner,"" argues Sir Jonathan Jones, who was the Treasury Solicitor until 2020. This, he believes, could be the best way forward - particularly around the definition of the ECHR's Article 8, which guarantees the right to, among other things, family life. ""It's legitimate for the government to say we will take a tighter view, as a proper, reasoned, good faith attempt to rein in what we think Article 8 covers and what it doesn't."" But Alex Chalk, the last Conservative Lord Chancellor before Labour won power, argues that the UK government needs to seek reform faster. ""The ECHR is not holy writ,"" he told the BBC during the Conservative party conference. ""This government should be moving much more quickly to seek urgent reform. [It] should have been saying, look, we want to lead on this to do this in six weeks. ""The US Constitution was drafted in 15 weeks or so. This really can be done."" 'Rights are going to suffer' Human rights lawyer Harriet Wistrich is concerned about what could be lost if the UK does leave the ECHR. It has, she argues, been at the forefront of challenging the state's treatment of victims of awful abuses. ""We were able to hold Greater Manchester Police accountable on behalf of Rochdale grooming gang victims through civil [damages] proceedings. ""The Hillsborough inquests were possible by having Article 2 [the right to life] inquiries into deaths, where you want to examine what went wrong and what the state could have done differently. ""If we withdraw fully… it's those rights that are going to suffer,"" says Ms Wistrich, who is also the founder of the Centre for Women's Justice. EPA In May, nine nations called for ECHR reform over migration law. Their open letter - which the UK did not sign - called for states to have greater freedom over who to kick out Beyond legal battles at home, there are big international questions too around leaving. The 1998 Belfast Agreement, the cornerstone of peace in Northern Ireland, and the post-Brexit deal with the European Union placed respect for human rights law at their centre. Critics of withdrawing from the EHCR predict both could come crashing down. But Professor Ekins believes that you can have human rights safeguards without a supranational court overseeing all nations. He and colleagues wrote a detailed proposal on Northern Ireland that argue the historic arrangements don't require the UK to remain in the ECHR, providing it honours human rights and cross-community power-sharing arrangements by other means. James Manning/PA Wire Leaving the ECHR 'will do nothing to stop the boats or fix our broken immigration system,' Sir Ed Davey argued The issues in Northern Ireland and the Republic could, however, go deeper. Sir Jonathan Jones for one is sceptical about how leaving the ECHR would go down in both places - because the ECHR's role in the agreement was to demonstrate to a lot of people who do not trust the British state that there are laws in place to protect them. ""The thing about the Convention is that it constrains governments, and it constrains the way that governments can treat minorities and people it doesn't like,"" he says. ""If we were out of the ECHR, you wouldn't have that constraint."" Alex Chalk warns there could be an international price to leaving, too. There is value, he says, in sitting at the Council of Europe and raising issues with French and German counterparts at international conferences. ""You should try to reform before you yank your way out because inevitably there could be cost to doing so,"" he argues. But ultimately, he adds, ""this is a matter of politics more than it is of law"".

52da01c4ba3b,'I cried every day': Victoria Beckham tells of fashion woes in new Netflix doc,,"'I cried every day': Victoria Beckham tells of fashion woes in new Netflix doc Noor Nanji Culture reporter Bauer-Griffin/GC Images/Getty Images ""It's not about him, it's about me,"" declares Victoria Beckham (""him"" being her husband Sir David Beckham). And that's exactly what we get in a new three-part documentary, which drops on Netflix on Thursday. The former Spice Girl and fashion entrepreneur, 51, is determined to tell her own story – two years after former England captain Sir David, 50, released his own, hugely successful TV series . The episodes take us inside Victoria's pop career, family life, struggles to reinvent herself and preparation for a major show at Paris Fashion Week. We also learn about the serious financial troubles her fashion business faced, and how she feared she might ""lose everything"". There are contributions from famous friends including Eva Longoria, and fashion titans such as Dame Anna Wintour and Donatella Versace. Here are our main takeaways from her documentary. Before the Spice Girls, Victoria was 'not cool' Shutterstock Lady Beckham achieved dizzying fame in the Spice Girls, so it's hard to believe that at school, she was ""that uncool kid"" who didn't fit in. ""I was definitely a loner at school"", she says, explaining she was bullied. The Spice Girls came together in 1994, after Mel B, Mel C, Emma Bunton, Geri Halliwell and Victoria responded to an advert for candidates. After the release of their chart-topping debut single Wannabe in 1996, ""Spice mania"" swept the planet, with their self-styled ""Girl Power"" mantra - a brand of female empowerment that made them a global pop culture phenomenon. Lady Beckham credits her bandmates for making her ""more lighthearted, more fun"" and says it was the first time she felt popular. She still had to face negative headlines about her weight, and discusses having an eating disorder. She says she never talked about it publicly, or even very much with her parents, but that it made her become “very good at lying"". But Lady Beckham says the other Spice Girls made her ""feel good enough"" about being herself. It's a message she continues to instil in her daughter Harper, 14. ""I tell Harper every day, be who you are,"" she says. What was buried in Baden-Baden? Alamy The WAGS (wives and girlfriends) descended on the spa town of Baden Baden in summer 2006 to support their partners Geri Halliwell left the Spice Girls in 1998 and the group split up in 2001. Lady Beckham says she found the transition ""really, really difficult"". She carried on making music, but the criticism she received ""really hurt"". Then came the infamous WAG period. Pictures of Victoria and other wives-and-girlfriends supporting their footballer partners in the German town of Baden-Baden in 2006 were plastered all over the tabloids. ""It was fun,"" says Lady Beckham of that time in her life. But she now concedes there was an ""element of attention seeking"" to it all. ""I was trying to find myself, I felt incomplete, sad, frozen in time maybe,"" she says. After the family moved to the US, Lady Beckham decided she wanted to work in fashion. But to do that, she knew she had to shed her other personas – the Spice Girl, the WAG. ""I buried those boobs in Baden-Baden,"" she says. Victoria 'almost lost everything' in struggles with fashion business Lady Beckham is strikingly honest about the struggles her fashion business faced. She says people didn't see her as ""cool at all"", and that a lot of people refused to take her seriously. And Vogue giant Dame Anna cements that view, when she says of Victoria's fashion aspirations: ""I thought maybe this was a hobby. I didn't quite believe it."" We see the growth of Victoria Beckham Ltd but also the serious financial troubles it faced. Sir David says he didn't think her business would survive, while Lady Beckham agrees. ""I almost lost everything and that was a dark, dark time,"" she says. ""I used to cry before I went to work every day because I felt like a firefighter."" Getty Images Romeo, Harper and David Beckham were in Paris last week to support Victoria at her fashion week show She says her firm was ""tens of millions in the red"". In a later scene, her voice breaks, and she wells up in tears, when she recalls how Sir David stepped in to help her business out. But the series also shows her turn things around, and we see her pull out all the stops in the run-up to her triumphant Spring/Summer show at Paris Fashion Week in September 2024. Supermodel Gigi Hadid walked for her, wearing a striking emerald green gown. Dame Anna is shown in attendance, and, in an earlier clip, says Lady Beckham ""totally proved us wrong"". Today, Victoria's business has offices in London and New York, with its flagship store in Mayfair, London. The brand's products are in 230 stores across 50 countries around the world, according to the company's website. Family life carries on, amid reports of feud with Brooklyn EPA (Left to right) David, Victoria, Brooklyn and Nicola Peltz Beckham at the London premiere of Beckham in 2023 The couple's eldest son, 26-year-old Brooklyn, gets a few mentions in the show and appears briefly. Lady Beckham brings him up in conversation, when discussing the morning sickness she faced while pregnant with him and performing with the Spice Girls. But for the past few months, much of the online interest around the Beckhams has focused on reports that Brooklyn and his wife Nicola have fallen out with the rest of the family. The couple were absent from David Beckham's 50th birthday celebrations and did not post a birthday message online, fuelling the intrigue. Nicola has in the past denied there was a feud in the family. Sir David and Lady Beckham have never acknowledged the rumoured rift, and declined to comment when asked by BBC News. We did get a hint on the topic recently from Victoria, who told the Sunday Times how she felt Liam and Noel Gallagher's reconciliation must have made their mother ""so happy"". ""As a mum, that must be... she must feel so happy to see her boys getting on,"" she said. Showbiz reporter Catrina Rose notes there was “no hint” of any alleged feud in the series. ""Victoria's setting a lot of records straight here, but she's not being drawn on this particular topic."" There's a good explanation for why she doesn't smile Lady Beckham's pout became her defining look in the 1990s. But in the new series, she admits there's a deeper reason as to why she never smiles. ""The minute I see a camera, I change,"" she says. ""The barrier goes up, my armour goes on, and that's when, you know, the miserable cow that doesn't smile - that's when she comes out. And I'm so conscious of that."" She adds that she would ""rather not be that person"" and wishes she had the confidence to walk out in front of cameras and smile. Elsewhere, she insists that she does actually smile. ""I've looked miserable for all these years because when we stand on the red carpet, this guy has always gone on the left,"" she says, gesturing at Sir David. ""When I smile, I smile from the left, because if I smile from the right, I look unwell. So consequently I'm smiling on the inside, but no one ever sees it, so that's why I look so moody."" That's one use of a noisy kitchen blender The programme is filled with small details about the Beckhams' relationship – many of which we didn't know before. For example, Sir David starts a blender when he doesn't want to listen to Victoria (so she says, anyway). The pair have fond memories of their whirlwind romance in the 1990s, which led to them getting married and having a baby within two years. Sir David reflects that his parents - and his manager - would have preferred him to marry a local girl who stayed in Manchester, where he was playing for Manchester United. ""But I didn't want that,"" he says, opting instead for globe-trotting celebrity Victoria. ""I was so excited, I wanted everyone to know I was dating Posh Spice,"" the former England captain says. Lady Beckham, for her part, says she was never a young girl dreaming of getting married or becoming a mum. ""It wasn't until I met David that those things even occurred to me,"" she says. There won't be another Beckham baby In the final episode, which was filmed before Sir David's 50th birthday this year, the pair get reflective about everything they have achieved, and what lies ahead for them. ""Success, it feels good, I'm not going to lie,"" says Victoria. ""I've still got a lot that I want to do."" Sir David, for his part, seems to have something else on his mind. ""Now we're both, well I'm almost 50, you're 51, what's next? Another baby?,"" David asks his wife. Victoria laughs. ""Another baby? My God. No."" Victoria Beckham, a three-part documentary series, is available now on Netflix.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/crrj4v9wre8o,entertainment,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/1452/live/6f0d40b0-a46f-11f0-b741-177e3e2c2fc7.jpg,2025-10-09T00:05:33.363000+00:00,a690f5d1526ab9bff3fa2ee1938874f5854d36f5
82e922935b72,Starmer meets Modi on his first visit to India,,"Sir Keir Starmer has met Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi on his first visit to the country. The two leaders met in India's financial capital Mumbai, where the prime minister is on a two-day trade mission with the largest ever delegation of more than 100 CEOs, entrepreneurs, university vice-chancellors and cultural leaders. The two sides are meeting to discuss ways to expand business and trade ties after India and UK signed landmark trade deal in July . Sir Keir will make a keynote address at a fintech conference later on Thursday. The prime minister has been given a rousing welcome in India, with thousands of photos of him and Modi lining parts of Mumbai that the two leaders will travel through on Thursday. Modi has called the visit a ""historic"" one. On his first day, Sir Keir met the founder of India's digital ID system - Nandan Nilekani - in the wake of plans to introduce a digital ID for people working in the UK. The government's plan to introduce compulsory digital ID for people to prove their right to work in the UK has seen more than 2.8 million people signing a petition against the idea. But Downing Street is determined to press on, claiming it'll curb the ability of migrants to work illegally. Sir Kier also announced that three Bollywood films will be made in the UK by Yash Raj Films from 2026, ending an eight-year hiatus. The government says the yet to be implemented UK-India trade deal has already led to £1bn of investment and almost 7,000 jobs being created in the UK. Under the trade deal, India's India's average tariff on UK products will drop from 15% to 3%. The UK will cut taxes on Indian clothing, footwear, jewellery and frozen seafood, among other goods, while India will reduce duties on the import of Scotch whisky, cosmetics, medical devices and luxury cars. The deal is touted to increase the UK's gross domestic product (GDP) by £4.8bn each year and boost trade between the two countries by an additional £25.5bn a year by 2040. Last year, trade between the UK and India totalled £42.6bn, and was already slated to grow. Before arriving in India, Sir Keir told reporters that the UK would not relax visa rules for India but added that there were ""massive opportunities"" to improve trade and cultural ties with India. Sir Keir's visit comes in the backdrop of Delhi's strained ties with Washington over President Donald Trump's decision to impose 50% tariffs on India, which includes a 25% penalty for buying Russian oil. India and the US have been negotiating a trade deal for months but haven't made a major breakthrough yet.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/czdj66llg9go,politics,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/46b6/live/0cd29c00-a4cf-11f0-b9e2-5ff3a1edd7bf.jpg,2025-10-09T06:27:25.828000+00:00,e1f81ea323069f1837d0b2027ccad9d5aebf3e8e
532441c5e000,Pubs could stay open longer under licensing reforms,,"Pubs and bars in England and Wales could see extended opening hours as the government launches a fast-track a review on ""outdated"" licensing rules. The plans could make it easier for venues to serve food outside and host more live music, in a bid to ""remove unnecessary barriers"". Pub landlords and local communities will be able to have their say in a four-week call for evidence. Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said the review was about ""cutting red tape"" and ""boosting footfall"" to support the UK's economic growth. But critics have warned relaxing rules around alcohol would lead to more antisocial behaviour. Sir Keir said ""pubs and bars are the beating heart of our communities"", and added that the government was ""backing them to thrive"". ""When our locals do well, our economy does too,"" he said. The call for evidence will focus on nine key recommendations from the Government's Licensing Taskforce, with particular emphasis on streamlining on-trade alcohol licensing for hospitality venues. It said it plans to cut the cost of licensing , extend business rates relief and cut alcohol duty on draught pints. Nick Mackenzie, co-chair of the Licensing Taskforce and chief executive at pub giant Greene King, said updating the licensing system was a ""vital step"" towards reducing the challenges of running a hospitality business. ""Pubs are faced with continued rising costs, placing them under enormous pressures which is why the Government must continue to back the sector, including critical reforms on business rates which would unlock opportunities for pubs to invest and help drive economic growth,"" he said. Dr Richard Piper, the chief executive of the charity Alcohol Change UK told the Guardian the proposed reforms would be a ""charter for chaos"" without support from local authorities and health experts. He said permitting vendors to sell alcohol later into the evening would ""inevitably mean more victims of crime, including domestic violence, more antisocial behaviour and disturbance, more police time spent dealing with drink-fuelled incidents and both ambulance and A&E staff having to deal with even more people who have come to harm as a result of alcohol"".",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c1l830m55dno,politics,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/ff79/live/414ddfd0-a4d4-11f0-92db-77261a15b9d2.jpg,2025-10-09T06:53:42.016000+00:00,ed146e217e05fb7832685f975f104537028476d8
43c9596e4810,The battle for Scotland's flag: Why the right has adopted the saltire,,"The battle for Scotland's flag: Why the right has adopted the saltire James Cook Scotland editor Getty Images Something has shifted in Scotland. The saltire, which was long embraced by supporters of Scottish independence, has now been unfurled for a different cause. Up and down the land, the blue and white of St Andrew is fluttering from lampposts and being waved alongside the union flag at anti-immigration protests. Until recently those two standards were more often seen on different sides of the debate about Scotland's future. Now the saltire's presence is generating controversy of its own at demonstrations from Perth to Aberdeen and from Glasgow to Falkirk, where the latest rally was held on Wednesday evening. This battle for Scotland's flag is also a battle about what it means to be a patriot in modern Scotland - a battle of competing nationalisms. Steven Rennie addresses a rally outside Glasgow Royal Concert Hall Steven Rennie is one of the prominent figures in these recent protests. He blends opposition to independence and immigration with sharp criticism of the Scottish National Party - which is in favour of both. I stood within a few feet of Mr Rennie as he addressed hundreds of supporters in the centre of Glasgow in late September. With his shoulders wrapped in the red, white and blue of the union flag, he spoke of the saltire. ""They claimed our national flag as their own and for 12 long years we've allowed them to wield it as a weapon of division and hate. ""But no more. We have reclaimed our flag, our identity, our pride and also our resolve,"" he said. Those on opposing sides of the debate have made their feelings known at protests The crowd - separated from hundreds of counter-protesters by a line of police officers - cheered the denunciation of the SNP whose leaders, in a referendum 11 years ago , failed to persuade a majority of Scottish voters to opt to leave the UK. ""The SNP has wreaked havoc on our nation, dismantling our prosperity and our potential at every turn, replacing us with new Scots and putting our own people at the bottom of the pile,"" said Mr Rennie. ""New Scots"" is a welcoming term used by Scottish government ministers who are keen to attract more foreign workers to help grow an economy which is challenged by a record low birth rate . The SNP has run the devolved government in Edinburgh since 2007 but immigration remains the responsibility of the UK government in London - and it has rejected calls for a separate Scottish visa system . Getty Images There was a counter-protest to the demonstration on Falkirk in August Migration is a thorn in the side for Labour Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer and appears to be rising up the agenda ahead of the Scottish parliamentary elections next spring. The small boats crisis and the accommodation of asylum seekers in hotels , which Sir Keir has promised to phase out, have fuelled demonstrations around the UK. That includes protests in Falkirk, where a building which was once a three-star hotel is being used to house migrants. One protester, who gave his name as Mark, held a union flag emblazoned with ""Stop the Boats"". He said politicians should be fixing ailing public services, not spending taxpayers' money on medical and dental care for asylum seekers. Mark was one of the protesters in Falkirk ""We're sick of these people rolling up in boats, getting four-star hotels,"" he told me. ""They're getting their three meals a day while Britain's services suffer. We're just sick of it and Starmer is not doing enough to try and stop it."" Minutes earlier one of the speakers had shouted: ""Keep Britain white. Keep Scotland white. Keep Scotland Scottish."" Mark insisted the man did not speak for him, and that the protest was ""nothing to do with racism"". Outside the hotel a group of counter-protesters, including many trade unionists, had gathered. They too were critical of the prime minister – but for different reasons. They accused him of pandering to the far right. Getty Images Counter-protesters demonstrated against a rally protesting about immigration in Glasgow earlier this month The two camps appear to share a sense of disgust about the UK's ailing economy and the poor state of public services - although they do not necessarily agree on the causes or the solutions. ""The real issue in our society is the people in government who aren't tackling these issues head on, not people fleeing persecution trying to find a better place to live,"" said a counter protester in Falkirk, who gave her name as Sage. Referring to the anti-asylum seeker protest across the road, she said: ""I don't blame these people for falling for these narratives, because everyone is suffering. ""It doesn't matter what side of the political spectrum we're on, everyone is going through it."" The real problem, insisted Sage, was billionaires making record profits and not paying enough tax. ""We know who is underfunding our services. It's not migrants and refugees,"" she said. One recurring complaint among protesters is about the number of migrants being housed at local authority expense. The issue is most acute in Glasgow, which has the UK's highest number of refugees in council accommodation. Asylum seekers are housed by the UK Home Office but, after they are granted leave to remain and become refugees, that support quickly expires. At that point, many become homeless and, because Scottish councils have a statutory duty to house all homeless people, they must step in. ""Essentially, we have run out of temporary accommodation,"" said Glasgow City Council leader Susan Aitken. ""We don't have anywhere to put all of these people who are now declaring themselves homeless in the city, and we're having to put them up in hotels, and that's very, very expensive."" Getty Images Protesters in Falkirk said they were opposed to housing asylum seekers in the town The SNP councillor for Langside wants the UK government to step in but is at pains to stress that refugees do not have priority over anyone else. Aitken added: ""Anyone who is telling you that asylum seekers and refugees are prioritised by the SNP, by the Scottish government, or by this council is lying to you. It is simply not true."" Still, some hostility to immigrants persists and migration has risen up the list of Scottish voters' concerns as flags have appeared on lampposts around the country. Hundreds of saltires have gone up in working class communities such as those in north and east Glasgow; Sighthill in Edinburgh; and Falkirk's Westfield. Shawn, a refugee who lives in north Glasgow, believes the saltire usually represents peace, harmony and inclusion - but says it is now being flown ""for the far-right and racism"". The former police officer and his mother Mala successfully sought asylum in the UK after they fled their South East Asian homeland in circumstances they asked not to discuss in public for their own safety. Shawn said he had experienced racism on the streets of Glasgow Shawn, who runs a community organisation called the Springburn Unity Network, said he had been subjected to racist insults in Glasgow and knew immigrants who were afraid to leave their homes because of the recent protests. Debates about flags are not just raging in Scotland's big cities and working class towns. In the prosperous Renfrewshire village of Bridge of Weir, the hoisting of saltires has led to a row on the local Facebook group. In the middle of the village, Dougie Moore told me he approved of the flags because they sent a message to immigrants that ""they should be coming to enjoy our country the way that we enjoy it rather than changing things"". Bunty Singh, who owns a local café and delicatessen, said he had no issue with anyone flying a national flag but also insisted there were no problems with immigration in Bridge of Weir. ""It's a peaceful, lovely village,"" insisted Mr Singh who was born in Glasgow to parents who were originally from India. ""We're happy to be here and we are welcomed here."" Bunty Singh said there were no problems with immigration in Bridge of Weir But at a local community hub Ian Gillies was concerned about the saltires, which he regarded as unwelcoming and divisive. ""I think it's in keeping with the spirit of the age,"" he said. ""'Every man for himself and we don't want anybody else coming our way.' I see the same trend in the States and elsewhere in the continent. It's sad to see it coming here."" Mr Gillies is not the only person to note an Americanisation of politics on this side of the Atlantic in the age of Donald Trump and social media. At the protest in Glasgow where Steven Rennie spoke about the saltire, there were chants, calls and placards in support of right-wing American influencer Charlie Kirk, who had been shot dead days earlier. Later the crowd chanted ""Oh Tommy, Tommy"", in tribute to the convicted criminal and far-right activist Stephen Yaxley-Lennon , who uses the name Tommy Robinson and has been supported by Elon Musk. Getty Images There were tributes to the late right-wing influencer Charlie Kirk at a demonstration in Glasgow Matthew Feldman, a visiting professor at Liverpool Hope University and leading expert on the radical right, said he was concerned that extremism was bleeding into mainstream political debate because overt racism and the glorification of terrorism were ""being given a pass"" on US-owned social media platforms. At the anti-migrant protest in Falkirk, one banner referenced former SNP first minister Humza Yousaf's calls for greater ethnic diversity in Scottish public life in a speech which had been highlighted and criticised by Musk and Reform UK leader Nigel Farage. The same banner went on to quote a white supremacist slogan known as the 14 Words: ""We must secure the existence of our people and a future for white children."" ""The 14 Words actually comes from the eighth chapter of Mein Kampf,"" explained Prof Feldman. He said the slogan was ""a translation of Hitler's sense of Aryan supremacy"" and was popularised in the US in the 1980s by the late white supremacist David Lane. ""It is inconceivable to me that somebody that is writing out that phrase doesn't associate it with white supremacism and, more importantly, with a sort of an anti or racist view towards ethnic and religious minorities,"" added Prof Feldman. Getty Images One banner at a protest in Falkirk contained a white supremacist slogan It was not the only extreme language on display in Falkirk. Another sign read ""Kill 'Em All. Let God Sort 'Em Out,"" a phrase originally associated with a 13th Century Catholic crusade. While not defending the placards, many of the protesters we spoke to insisted they had genuine concerns about the safety of women and children. They pointed to the conviction of an Afghan asylum seeker for raping a 15-year-girl in the town and the arrest of a resident of the asylum hotel on sexual indecency charges, which he denies. Farage has also suggested sexual assault by asylum seekers is a particular problem, a claim described by Glasgow City Council leader Susan Aitken as one of history's oldest and nastiest racist slurs. When I spoke to Farage on a visit to Aberdeen earlier this year he insisted that Reform UK was now a serious contender in Scottish politics. ""I've spent a year going around England campaigning ahead of the English local elections, and perceptions of me and the party have changed over that last year, and I intend to make that happen in Scotland over the next year,"" he told me. That claim may be bolstered by Reform's strong third place in June's Hamilton, Larkhall and Stonehouse by-election , which Labour won. On Wednesday, Scotland's First Minister John Swinney said arguments about immigration were being ""fanned by a wider debate"" going on in the UK and around the globe. The SNP leader told me he believed in a Scotland that was ""tolerant, welcoming and inclusive"" and urged people ""to avoid us being swept down a route of a relentless rightward direction in the United Kingdom"". Swinney added: ""I don't think that's where Scotland wants to be. I don't think that's how Scotland feels. And I want to make sure that people in Scotland realise that there is a danger that we will be carried down that route if we don't take a different course."" Polls ahead of May's Holyrood election suggest a big lead for the SNP, with Reform potentially overtaking the Conservatives to challenge Labour for second place, despite never before having won a seat at Holyrood. Whatever flags are waved by whichever party in the campaign, immigration appears likely to take its place alongside the economy and public services as a big issue.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/clyxqknx7jqo,politics,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/fe18/live/e1266390-a44a-11f0-b741-177e3e2c2fc7.jpg,2025-10-09T05:23:41.120000+00:00,f00d9d17665b7a7e2ee6de315db240aad28103dd

The local theatre and performance group have been committed to carrying the rural custom of ""mumming"" or ""rhyming"" into the 21st century, and in doing so caught the attention of McQueen's creative director, Seán McGirr. Historically, mumming saw groups dress up in masks and costume, going from house to house to perform poetry, theatre, music and dance. Often communities used this to mark important times in their calendar. ""When we got the e-mail in July, we weren't sure it was real. McQueen is such a fashion behemoth, their shows are so beautiful and known for their theatrics,"" said programme manager Clare Jennings. ""The creative director Seán McGirr is Irish and is very inspired by Irish culture, history and heritage, incorporating Irish folklore and mythology in the shows and in the collections. It just seemed like a really natural fit."" Handout Clare has been a member of the Armagh Rhymers for four years The group worked with local straw craft workers to produce large straw maypole toppers which were then used as part of the set. Craft artist Moira Burns hand-made more than 500 harvest knots. Traditionally thought to be a love token, the harvest knots were used as invites for guests.

""We were in traditional mask and costume on the red carpet as guests arrived,"" Clare told BBC News NI. ""It was a really an amazing opportunity to showcase the local heritage and craft that we do have here, and for a fashion house like McQueen to see the beauty and the value in our local craft."" Often performing community groups or visiting schools, a haute couture show is a departure from the Armagh Rhymers day-to-day schedule. ""When Dara started the Rhymers nearly 50 years ago now, a lot of these ancient traditions were in danger of dying out or being forgotten about, so we feel very lucky that Seán McGirr was so interested in the ancient tradition of mumming and what we do,"" Anne added.

9d94af385a6e,All Post Office Horizon victims entitled to free legal advice for first time,,"All Post Office Horizon victims entitled to free legal advice for first time Emma Simpson Business correspondent and Emer Moreau Business reporter PA Media All victims of the Post Office Horizon IT scandal seeking compensation will now be entitled to free legal advice, the government has announced. The change could potentially have a major effect on the size of the payouts some victims are able to achieve. It is one of a number of improvements to the compensation schemes available to victims, made in response to the first report from the public inquiry into the scandal, widely described as one of the UK's worst ever miscarriages of justice. In July, the chair of the inquiry, Sir Wyn Williams, delivered his findings into the human impact of the scandal and called for urgent action . The government said it has accepted all but one of the recommendations relating specifically to Horizon. More than 900 sub-postmasters were prosecuted after the faulty Horizon computer system made it look like money was missing from their branch accounts. Hundreds of others poured their own savings into their branch to make up apparent shortfalls in order to avoid prosecution. Making the announcement, Business Secretary Peter Kyle said there was ""clearly more to do to bring justice to those affected"" and accepting the recommendations was a ""crucial step"" towards doing this. There are four compensation schemes for victims in various circumstances, but they have been criticised for being too slow and complicated and for only paying out fractions of the claims made. Changes announced by the government on Thursday mean that victims who have sought compensation through the Horizon Shortfall Scheme (HSS) - which accounts for more than half of the compensation claims paid out so far - are now eligible for government-funded legal advice. This brings it in line with the three other schemes. The government has also committed to setting up a new appeals process for postmasters who accepted a fixed payout under the HSS scheme. Many victims have previously complained about being forced to accept low offers of compensation, without the benefit of legal advice. Action taken in response to other recommendations included: the government extending the date for the closure of the HSS scheme giving greater clarity on the definition of ""full and fair redress"" starting work on a restorative justice project for postmasters So far, more than £1.2bn has been paid out to more than 9,000 claimants across all of the compensation schemes. Reacting, a spokesperson for Fujitsu - who provided the Horizon IT system - said the company had ""apologised for, and deeply regret, our role in sub-postmasters' suffering"". 'Battling all the time' Tony Downey Tony Downey and his wife Caroline were victims of the Post Office scandal Tony Downey bought the Hawkshead Post Office in the Lake District in 2001. He and his wife Caroline were forced to put in £35,000 of their own savings to make up for ""losses"" created by the faulty software. He lost his home, his livelihood and went bankrupt as a result. His health has also suffered. Mr Downey is still waiting for full compensation nearly three years after submitting his claim. ""It just seems to be battling, all the time, to get a little bit more, and a little bit more, and a little bit more,"" he said. ""We're just exhausted with it."" Responding to Mr Downey's testimony, a government spokesperson said: ""We pay tribute to all the postmasters including Tony who have suffered from the Horizon scandal, which is why the amount paid to postmasters has increased fivefold to over £1bn as part of our ongoing commitment to deliver justice to victims as swiftly as possible.

At the end of August the waiting list for routine treatments hit 7.41 million – in May it was 7.36 million. The proportion waiting longer than the target time of 18 weeks has also risen. Experts said the government was facing a significant challenge reducing waits, but ministers said its investment in the NHS would pay off. The government has promised that by the end of this parliament it will hit the 18-week waiting time target – something that has not been done for a decade. That requires 92% of patients, waiting for treatments such as knee and hip operations, to be seen within 18 weeks. Currently, 61% are. Over the summer waits worsened following a period of sustained progress after Labour came to power. Dr Francesca Cavallaro, of the Health Foundation think-tank, said on current trends the government would fall short on its pledge. ""The scale of the challenge remains significant."" Prof Peter Friend, of the Royal College of Surgeons of England, predicted the coming winter would be tough. ""The government must face facts: without urgent investment in NHS infrastructure and support for staff wellbeing, progress on reducing waiting times will remain slow. ""Surgeons are ready to do more but are held back by critical resource issues - a lack of operating time, staff vacancies and equipment. Patients deserve better."" Rory Deighton, of the NHS Confederation, which represents health bosses, said: ""NHS leaders and their teams are working incredibly hard to boost productivity. So it is deeply frustrating that waiting lists have gone up for the third month in a row. But Health Minister Stephen Kinnock defended the performance of the NHS. He said it had been a ""record-breaking"" summer with more tests and checks being done than ever before. ""We know there's more to do - that's why we're pressing ahead with new surgical hubs, evening and weekend scans, and cutting-edge technology to get millions more patients treated on time,"" he added.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cqje5ljdnygo,politics,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/a2f1/live/3869b8b0-a4f9-11f0-8e74-1f6664d312e9.jpg,2025-10-09T10:24:23.722000+00:00,a23c931a07404d6450a9536580ce43ced5fd0e52

Her husband, Belfast Alliance councillor Michael Long, said ""about 40 people, some wearing masks, turned up at our house to protest"". It is believed the protest related to the housing of sex offenders in residential areas. In a social media post, Mrs Long said: ""It's bullying and intimidation. It's threatening and wholly unacceptable."" The police attended the incident and said they would now review footage to ""consider if any potential offences have been committed"". In addition to her role as Stormont's justice minister, Mrs Long is also the leader of the Alliance Party. She said she was open to debating issues, but added: ""Turning up as a mob, some in masks, at my home just isn't on."" Her post said: ""It isn't engagement and it isn't legitimate protest to turn up at my home, disrupt my neighbours, my family and place pressure on police."" Alliance to review personal security Alliance Party deputy leader Eóin Tennyson said the Longs would not be ""intimidated"" by the mob but that they ""shouldn't have to put up with it"". He told The Nolan Show that it was ""completely unacceptable"" and ""hugely distressing"". ""At the heart of this, politicians are humans too and any of us would be shaken by a mob turning up outside our home."" Tennyson added that the couple are ""two of the most accessible politicians in Northern Ireland"". ""They have never shied away from debate, they have never shied away from robust engagement, they have never shied away from being held to account,"" he said. ""But what is completely unacceptable is to seek to harass and intimate politicians in their homes, and that is exactly what happened last night."" Speaking later at Stormont, Tennyson described the incident as a ""turning point"". He told reporters the Alliance party ""will now be taking steps now to review the personal safety of all of our elected representatives"". Previous death threats Pacemaker Belfast councillor Michael Long said ""about 40 people, some wearing masks, turned up at our house to protest"" Writing on X, Mr Long said a police car ""had to sit outside the house overnight in case of attack"". It is not the first time Alliance Party representatives have complained of intimidation. In 2012, the party was targeted by loyalists after it supported a move to only display the union flag at Belfast City Hall on designated days. Mrs Long received death threats over the issue, and later revealed she was being treated for skin cancer at the same time. Two years later, her East Belfast constituency office was attacked with petrol bombs. However, Mr Long said: ""In 25 years, no one has protested at our house"" until the incident on Wednesday night. 'Sinister and entirely wrong' First Minister Michelle O'Neill, from Sinn Féin, described it as ""absolutely disgusting"". She added that ""turning up at someone's home is intimidation, not protest. It is never acceptable."" Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) leader Gavin Robinson said that ""the private homes of elected politicians should be firmly off limits"". ""Whatever the reason for political protest, what happened last night at Naomi Long's home should be roundly condemned,"" he added. Ulster Unionist leader Mike Nesbitt said he was ""shocked and horrified"" by the actions of the crowd. ""We live in a democracy. There are acceptable ways to express your opposition. Intimidation is not one of them."" Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP) leader Claire Hanna said the party sends ""sincere solidarity"" to the Longs after the ""disgraceful scenes"". ""There will always be political disagreement, particularly in a place with as fraught a history as this, but to turn up outside a politician's home and try to intimidate them is sinister and entirely wrong,"" she added.

Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Woman's Hour on Thursday, the Happy Valley writer said the show, which starts on Sunday, draws from her own midlife experiences. ""It's very personal for me this,"" she said. ""It's a lot about what I was going through at what [actress] Tamsin (Greig) very eloquently called 'the middle squeeze'."" She added: ""It's just about midlife - menopause is just an aspect of that - and I wanted to find a way of writing about this part of your life in a way that was uplifting and engaging and interesting."" Getty Images Lorraine Ashbourne, Sally Wainwright, Rosalie Craig, Joanna Scanlan, Tamsin Greig and Amelia Bullmore attended a recent launch for the show She continued: ""It's about women who find something very creative and very engaging to do together and how it changes their lives."" Riot Women tells the tale of five menopausal women who form a punk rock band to take part in a local talent contest. It features stage and screen star Rosalie Craig as the chaotic Kitty Eckerson, alongside an ensemble cast of bandmates including Friday Night Dinner star Grieg, Gentleman Jack's Amelia Bullmore, Lorraine Ashbourne from Alma's Not Normal and The Thick of It comic actress Joanna Scanlan. Together the women foster a sense of solidarity and address their experiences candidly. Wainwright, the Bafta-winning writer from Huddersfield, said she'd always wanted to write something as a sort of tribute to the 1970s musical drama Rock Follies. She started to think about it properly about 10 years ago when she working on the one-off BBC drama To Walk Invisible, about the lives and literary achievements of the Brontë sisters. ""At around that time, my mum started to develop dementia, and I felt I was being pulled in so many different directions,"" she explained to presenter Anita Rani. ""I still had two boys at home, one just about to go to university, the other one thinking about what he was going to do, education wise."" She added: ""You know that adage about if something needs doing, ask a busy woman?... I was that woman who just was being expected lots of - in a good way. You're often at the height of your career. ""And so you've been pulled in all sorts of directions and balancing a huge amount of things, and in the middle of that the menopause started."" She noted how along with hot flushes, brain fog and a low mood, it had brought with it a kind of ""low self esteem that you don't expect"". ""It just seemed well worth writing about,"" she said, noting how it had been like ""therapy"" to do so. Rosalie Craig as Kitty Eckersley in the show The writer felt it was neccessary and useful for the cast to learn to play their instruments live for the series, on songs such as Just Like Your Mother and Seeing Red. Craig - who starred in Stephen Sondheim's Company on the West End - told the same programme it was ""phenomenal"" to be asked to portray the carefree and at-times shameless frontwoman, Kitty. ""She's constructed somebody who doesn't have a filter, and that's partly because of what she's been through in life, and being the victim of aggression,"" said Craig. ""She faces the world like that, with two fists,"" she went on. ""She exorcises herself through the use of song, which was really brilliant to do.""

3dc82d219481,Five ways abolishing stamp duty could change the housing market,,"Five ways abolishing stamp duty could change the housing market Kevin Peachey Cost of living correspondent Getty Images The debate around stamp duty is intensifying. When Kemi Badenoch said a future Conservative government would abolish it on the purchase of main homes, it went down well at the Tory Party conference . There has also been speculation that the Chancellor, Rachel Reeves, is considering replacing it. Scrapping stamp duty would be popular among some home buyers, including first-time buyers. But, analysts say there would be some significant consequences of scrapping stamp duty for primary residences, affecting buyers, sellers and the wider UK economy. 1. House prices might rise Whenever there has been a temporary easing of stamp duty, such as in the immediate aftermath of the Covid lockdowns, house prices have then risen. It is more difficult to judge whether a permanent abolition would have the same long-term impact on prices as the short-term sweetener of a stamp duty holiday. However, greater demand is likely to feed through to asking prices. ""If, and this is a big if, it is a simple tax giveaway, the likelihood is that the current stamp duty bill simply passes through into prices,"" says Lucian Cook, head of residential research at Savills. In turn, that could mean first-time buyers paying less in stamp duty, but having to find a bigger deposit. ""Given the way stamp duty works, this would be unevenly distributed across the country,"" Mr Cook added. The most obvious point here is that the government in Westminster can only control stamp duty in England and Northern Ireland. Scotland and Wales have their own land and transaction taxes overseen by the devolved administrations. 2. Tax cut for the wealthy A swathe of first-time buyers do not pay stamp duty. That's because, in England and Northern Ireland, they are exempt when buying properties of up to £300,000 . ""For them, the enormous challenge is raising a deposit,"" says Sarah Coles, head of personal finance at investment platform Hargreaves Lansdown. Data from property portal Rightmove suggests that 40% of homes for sale in England are stamp duty free for first-time buyers. While the vast majority of movers pay stamp duty, the rate increases at certain price thresholds . So, the bigger the home, the bigger the benefit, if stamp duty was scrapped. This will also mean a big regional difference in the impact of such a policy. At the moment, 76% of properties on sale in the North East of England are free of stamp duty for first-time buyers, according to Rightmove's figures. In London, it is only 11%. Richard Donnell, from Zoopla, points out that 60% of all stamp duty is paid in southern England - so the majority of the benefit of abolition would be felt in the south. 3. Easier to find somewhere to move to One of the great selling points of stamp duty abolition is the extra mobility it should provide for workers, buyers, sellers and downsizers, according to experts. ""Homeownership is the foundation of a fairer and more secure society - but stamp duty has denied that opportunity to too many for too long,"" says Paula Higgins, chief executive of the Homeowners Alliance. ""Our research shows over 800,000 homeowners have shelved moving plans in the past two years, and stamp duty is a major barrier."" The Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS), an independent economic think tank, says the winners will be those who want to move frequently, to more or less expensive homes. It should, for example, clear an obstacle for older homeowners, who want to sell a family home but are discouraged by stamp duty. If they are more likely to move, then their homes become available to younger families and the whole market becomes more fluid. However, others suggest the influence of stamp duty could be overblown. ""Take someone downsizing, from a £750,000 property to a £300,000 one. In England and Northern Ireland, they'd pay £5,000 in stamp duty. It's a fraction of what they're likely to pay in estate agency fees, and sits along a huge range of costs from conveyancing to removals,"" Ms Coles from Hargreaves Lansdown says. ""It begs the question of whether removing the cost of the tax is a gamechanger."" 4. Potential tax rises elsewhere Stamp duty raises a lot of money for the Treasury, so scrapping it would leave a gap in the public finances. The IFS said that the direct cost of the Conservative policy might be around £10.5bn to £11bn in 2029-30, although the Tories' own estimate is about £9bn. The question for any administration tempted to scrap or reduce stamp duty is how else it finds the money. The Conservatives say they will make savings elsewhere. The other option is to raise other taxes. As some analysts have said, the main consideration is not what is scrapped, but what replaces it. 5. Bad news for renters The idea of scrapping stamp duty for primary residences could end up meaning less choice for renters. The IFS suggests it could discourage the purchase of rental properties by landlords, as they would still have to pay stamp duty. The think tank says it would increase the more favourable tax treatment of owner-occupation relative to renting.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c9v7wppzm2ro,politics,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/e48c/live/cdb688c0-a4f5-11f0-8e74-1f6664d312e9.jpg,2025-10-09T14:36:03.640000+00:00,628426e97ee7ef7b1b86526c83fc901fe2890fe7

The 68-year-old has also been charged with nine counts of indecent assault and two counts of sexual assault. The charges related to seven women, with the allegations spanning from 1983 to 2016. Westwood is due to appear at Westminster Magistrates' Court on 10 November. The oldest of the charges relates to the alleged indecent assault of a 17-year-old girl in the Fulham area of London in 1983. The oldest rape charge relates to an alleged attack on a female between the age of 17 and 18 in London between 1995 and 1996. Westwood is also accused of raping a female between the age of 17 and 18 in London between 2000 and 2001, and raping a woman in her 20s in the same city in 2010. The most recent charge relates to the alleged sexual assault of a woman in her 20s in the Finchley area of London.

b6c1dd292e2c,Starmer praises Trump over role in Gaza ceasefire deal,,"Starmer praises Trump over role in Gaza ceasefire deal Sam Francis Political reporter EPA Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has praised US President Donald Trump's leadership in the Gaza peace talks, claiming the deal ""would not have happened"" without him. On Wednesday, Trump announced Israel and Hamas had agreed to the first phase of his 20-point peace plan, in a major step towards a permanent end to their war. It comes two years and two days after the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others taken hostage. Sir Keir said the UK ""played an important part behind the scenes"" and had seen Trump's efforts on securing ""a real breakthrough"" in the negotiations. Asked whether Trump deserves the Nobel Peace Prize, Sir Keir said the agreement ""would not have happened without President Trump's leadership"". Speaking at a press conference on a visit to Mumbai, he added: ""I want to be really clear about that and I say that from the informed position of the UK having played a part behind the scenes in this with the US and with the mediators."" The UK now ""stands ready to play our part in implementing this, again with others, as we go forward,"" he said. When asked about ex-Prime Minister Sir Tony Blair potentially joining the ""Board of Peace"", scheduled to take over the running of Gaza from Hamas under the deal, Sir Keir said he was not interested in ""discussions of personnel"". ""What matters now is to press on and implement this,"" he told reporters. In a statement earlier, Sir Keir welcomed news of the deal as ""a moment of profound relief that will be felt all around the world"". ""I am grateful for the tireless diplomatic efforts of Egypt, Qatar, Turkiye and the United States, supported by our regional partners, in securing this crucial first step. This agreement must now be implemented in full, without delay, and accompanied by the immediate lifting of all restrictions on life-saving humanitarian aid to Gaza,"" he said. ""We call on all parties to meet the commitments they have made, to end the war, and to build the foundations for a just and lasting end to the conflict and a sustainable path to a long-term peace."" The announcement of the deal on Wednesday led to scenes of celebration in both Israel and Palestine, including people waving US flags and dancing in Tel-Aviv's Hostage Square. What has been announced so far represents only part of the 20-point peace plan unveiled by Trump last week, which Israel had accepted and Hamas had partly agreed to. The announcements did not cover some thorny issues both sides have not reached a resolution on. Notably, no details surround the disarmament of Hamas - a key point in Trump's plan. Hamas has previously refused to lay down its weapons, saying it would only do so when a Palestinian state had been established. Conservative Leader Kemi Badenoch also praised the US president, who she said ""deserves credit for brokering this deal, with the support of Arab partners and Turkey"". ""The ceasefire deal in Gaza is hugely welcome"" and will be ""an enormous relief to the families of Israeli hostages, so cruelly captured by Hamas two years ago"". She called on Hamas to ""fully disarm and return all hostages"". Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey said ""news of a ceasefire deal in Gaza brings real hope"". ""This must be the first step towards a two-state solution and a lasting peace,"" Sir Ed added. Reform UK leader Nigel Farage, a long-time ally of the US President, posted on social media: ""Huge congratulations to President Trump and his team.

Robert Aramayo, who is from Hull, plays John Davidson, who became the reluctant poster boy for the condition in 1989 when he was 16. The Lord of the Rings and Game of Thrones actor said he spent a lot of time with Mr Davidson during filming of I Swear. ""It was a real challenge, probably the biggest challenge I've done. Having John there and having his guidance and help was invaluable,"" Aramayo said. 'Pinch yourself moments' Tourette's syndrome is an incurable condition that causes someone to make sudden, repetitive sounds or movements, known as tics. Mr Davidson, now 54, is credited as the person who introduced it to many people through a series of documentaries, beginning with John's Not Mad in 1989. He was later appointed MBE for his campaigning. The comedy-drama film by Kirk Jones also features Maxine Peake, Shirley Henderson and Peter Mullan. While speaking to BBC Radio Humberside , Aramayo praised his colleagues and described them as ""incredible actors"". He said there were ""pinch yourself moments"" while working with ""legends"".

2ee5328b24b9,Previously unpublished Seamus Heaney poems released,,"Previously unpublished Seamus Heaney poems released Getty Images Heaney has long been internationally recognised as the greatest Irish poet since WB Yeats A new book of Seamus Heaney's work ""represents the full arc of his writing life in one place,"" a Heaney expert has said. A major new volume of the late writer's work brings together his published and previously unseen poems for the first time. For Stephen Connolly, from the Seamus Heaney Centre at Queens University in Belfast , this edition is the ""first place where everything is all together"". The Poems of Seamus Heaney includes all 12 of the late poet's collections, alongside a selection of ""uncollected"" poems that originally appeared in newspapers, journals and magazines under different pen names. The edition also includes 25 previously unpublished poems collected and selected by the Heaney family and made public. Many of the unpublished poems are housed in the National Library of Ireland (NLI) in Dublin, where the poet bequeathed his works before his death in 2013. The new, never before seen material, published by Faber, includes both ""uncollected"" and ""unpublished"" poems. 'Full arc of his writing life' Stephen Connolly Stephen Connolly from the Seamus Heaney centre at Queen's University Belfast Stephen said that among the uncollected poems are some of the ""first he ever published using his own name in the Belfast Telegraph, called Turkeys Observed, which wouldn't have appeared in any earlier editions"". While living in Belfast during the early 1950s, Stephen said Heaney published some poems under the penname Incertus - which is the Latin word for uncertain - which were published in student magazines. Getty Images Seamus Heaney pictured in Venice in 2008 Nobel laureate, Heaney, who was from Bellaghy in County Londonderry died in August 2013 at the age of 74. He has long been internationally recognised as the greatest Irish poet since WB Yeats. Heaney's first book, Death of a Naturalist (1966), contained rich depictions of his rural upbringing. By the 1970s, as the Troubles worsened, his work took a more political turn. Fascinated by folklore, he also published an award-winning translation of Beowulf. Heaney has held Professorships at Harvard, and was Oxford Professor of Poetry. Heaney was proud Irishman and famously protested against his inclusion in the Penguin Book of Contemporary British Poetry with the lines, ""Be advised, my passport's green/ No glass of ours was ever raised/ To toast the Queen.""

3b93fe02d029,Sunak joins Microsoft and AI firm as paid adviser,,"Rishi Sunak has taken up paid adviser roles at tech giant Microsoft and artificial intelligence start-up Anthropic. The former prime minister has been told he must not lobby ministers on behalf of the companies by the Advisory Committee on Business Appointments (Acoba), an independent watchdog which oversees the activities of former government figures. Sunak - who remains the MP for Richmond and Northallerton - said he was ""delighted"" to be working ""with two of the world's leading tech firms"" and planned to donate his earnings to a charity he founded. During his premiership, Sunak made tech regulation a significant priority, setting up an AI safety summit in 2023 . In letters of advice sent to Sunak by Acoba and published on Thursday, his part-time role at Microsoft was described as providing ""high- level strategic perspectives"" on geopolitical trends. The watchdog said it had been informed by Sunak that his part-time advisory role at Anthropic - an AI firm seeking to compete with companies like OpenAI, Google and Meta - would be ""akin to operating as an internal think tank"". Acoba said Anthropic ""has a significant interest in UK government policy"", meaning that Sunak's appointment could potentially be seen to offer ""unfair access and influence"" within government. The appointment with Microsoft, a ""major investor"" in the UK, also presented similar issues, it wrote. However, it also said that his time spent out of government would have reduced the value of any information Sunak may still possess, while reiterating the standing rules ex-ministers have to abide when seeking employment after leaving government. Sunak was told not to advise on bidding for UK contracts, or to lobby the government for two years from his last day in ministerial office. In addition to the two tech roles, it was previously confirmed Sunak will act as a paid advisor to the bank Goldman Sachs , where he previously worked between 2001 and 2004. There had been speculation that Sunak, who was in No 10 between October 2022 and July 2024, would leave the Commons to take up a Silicon Valley role shortly after the election. He previously lived in California, where he still has a home, and held a US visa until 2021. But in his final prime minister's questions, Sunak vowed to spend more time in his constituency, which he called ""the greatest place on Earth"". ""If anyone needs me, I will be in Yorkshire,"" he said. All proceeds from the new roles will be donated to The Richmond Project, a charity Sunak founded with his wife to tackle numeracy problems in the UK, another area he was vocal about while in Downing Street. Posting on social media, Sunak said he would use his roles to ""ensure"" that coming technological change ""delivers the improvements in all of our lives"". Sunak said: ""I have long believed that technology will transform our world and play a key part in determining our future. ""We stand on the edge of a technological revolution whose impacts will be as profound as those of the industrial revolution: and felt more quickly.""",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/clyqe22pz81o,politics,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/75b5/live/f04264c0-a538-11f0-8469-192d9823e9a2.jpg,2025-10-09T19:37:59.868000+00:00,c60a9fe42a13157b4d701ee343699f90a82cf967

Nine people were removed on Thursday, in addition to a group of 10 last week, the government said. Previous removals have involved smaller numbers of people. It takes the number returned to France under the deal to 26, while the UK has accepted 18 in return. Ministers hope the scheme will deter people from attempting to enter the UK illegally in small boats by threatening removal to France, with properly vetted asylum seekers accepted in return. But on Thursday, the Home Office confirmed 1,075 migrants crossed the Channel the previous day. Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood said the recent return of larger groups would send a ""clear message"" to ""think twice"" about travelling to the UK illegally. ""We must put an end to these dangerous crossings which put lives at risk and money in the pockets of criminal gangs,"" Mahmood said. Thursday's flight saw a regular deportation flight bound for Eastern Europe diverted to France to offload nine people. The Home Office said more flights are scheduled to take place ""over the coming days and weeks"". The first removal under the UK-France deal was carried out in September, with the scheme set to run until June 2026.

cea4d9bba065,From the fishing trip to a Gavin & Stacey film - five things Jones and Corden's book reveals,,"From the fishing trip to a Gavin & Stacey film - five things Jones and Corden's book reveals Getty Images Corden says the pair's friendship is one of the things he is most proud of When Ruth Jones and James Corden first met in 2000, they never imagined it would lead to 22 episodes of a record-breaking TV show. The pair were filming Fat Friends at the Crowne Plaza in Leeds and formed an unexpected friendship . Now their book When Gavin Met Stacey is out, revealing how an argument inspired one iconic scene, and a scrapped storyline idea that would have seen Gavin have an affair. The book is a story of love and friendship, and here are some of the things we have learned: 1. The fishing trip scene was filmed - but never made the final cut A video showing unseen material from the infamous fishing trip was previously shown in a Gavin and Stacey documentary For years, the infamous fishing trip involving Bryn and his nephew Jason has been wrapped in secrecy and speculation. In the long-awaited finale, Gwen delivers a line that reignites the intrigue: ""Their trip 30 years ago almost tore this family apart."" That's all we know, along with clues that they were on their knees, it was freezing cold, and whatever happened was ""completely legal in this country"". While fans were given a glimpse of the pair's escapades , in true Gavin and Stacey fashion the secret was never revealed. But during an event to promote their new book Jones and Corden revealed that a scene shedding light on the mystery was actually filmed. It featured Bryn clearing out his home when he stumbles upon a camcorder tape labelled ""The Fishing Trip"". Jason walks in, stunned, and asks Bryn why he still has it. He then requests to watch it, but Bryn refuses. Jones and Corden explained that the idea was for the tape to play and just as viewers brace for the big reveal, the footage fuzzes out and jams. The scene was dropped in the final edit due to time constraints, ultimately leaving the secret safely tucked away with Bryn, Jason… and Dave Coaches. As for what really happened? Jones confessed: ""I have completely stolen James's idea for the answer to what happened on the fishing trip. I say 'I don't know because I wasn't there'."" 2. Row between Corden and Jones led to an iconic scene Getty Images Adrian Scarborough played Pete Sutcliffe and Julia Davis played his wife, Dawn in the series Corden refers to this as the ""Easter egg row"", with Jones saying it is all ""a little bit vague"", but she was travelling up from Cardiff for a writing session for series two and was meeting Corden in London. Jones continues that she had a message from James Thornton, Joanna Page's husband a few days earlier as he had a script idea and asked if she would mind reading it. ""So I texted back to say, 'Oh yes, by all means send me the script and I'll have a look. Don't know if I can help but I'm happy to have a look'."" She continues that instead of sending the text to James Thornton she sent it to Corden, and messaged him saying ""Sorry that wasn't meant for you"". Corden asked who was it for? ""And I don't know what possessed me, but I just went 'Oh it doesn't matter, I cant tell you about it'. And for some bizarre reason you went, 'Oh my god, are you doing Doctor Who?' and I said 'I'm sorry I cant tell you because I've signed a confidentiality clause."" BBC/Baby Cow Productions/Neil Bennett Gavin and Stacey was first screened in 2007 Jones says Corden was furious with her. ""I was basically playing a joke on you, which I rarely do because I'm not really a wind up merchant,"" adding that Corden is. She adds she was enjoying teasing Corden, but then he took it badly and said ""just forget it, I'm going to Benidorm"". Jones said she was really cross, but the pair made up in the hotel bar, and Jones told Corden she was just winding him up, and they went across the road and bought some Easter eggs. Corden said they bought two giant Cadbury's Easter eggs, and lay on the hotel bed, opened them and laid there with chocolate eggs on their faces. ""It was shortly after that we wrote Dawn and Pete's vows, when she changes the words to lyrics of Michael Jackson's 'Ben'. Jones added: ""We had a sugar rush, had a sugar low, fell asleep woke up and wrote the vows scene. ""I remember getting really hysterical writing it. It was absolutely joyous, it was magic."" 3. Stephen Fretwell didn't want his song to be the theme song Getty Images Corden and Jones came up with the idea for the series when they both met when they were filming Fat Friends Corden really loves the Stephen Fretwell album Magpie and for a long time they thought about having a piece of written score as the theme. Corden says: ""A few different people like David Arnold wrote pieces, and wrote one piece with a Welsh harp, it was beautiful but didn't feel right. ""I kept saying how I really love that drum sound and the piano chords on the Stephen Fretwell song Run."" Corden continues that the The Office and The Royale Family inspired them, with both shows having simple title sequences, but Gavin and Stacey couldn't afford one. ""We went with a black card with white writing and I wouldn't change it for the world, and I kept saying 'let's have something that feels a bit like Run' and then in the end it was like 'what if it's that',"" adding that on some level the lyrics in the song feel like Nessa and Smithy's relationship. During the London event, the co-creators of the BBC show also met Fretwell for the first time, where he confessed he has initially told his agent he didn't want his song used for the programme. 4. Corden's 40th birthday in Mexico led to the 2019 special PA Corden and James co-wrote and starred in the series Jones reveals it was Corden's wife Jules inviting her to Mexico for his 40th that clinched the 2019 special happening. Corden said as soon as Jones walked in he burst into tears and was so ""unbelievably happy to see you"". He says they had the ""best weekend"" adding the couple had always laughed about the fact that Jones had sung Wild Thing at her wedding after a few drinks, and one of his greatest regrets was he wasn't there because they didn't know each other. At Corden's 40th, Jones got up and sang Wild Thing, improvising the lyrics to make them specific to Corden. ""I just remember singing and seeing your face. The joy on your face,"" she says. Corden adds: ""Harry Styles was going to you 'I cant believe you just did that',"" with Jones saying: ""Yeah he looked a bit in shock, I don't know if it was in a good way or bad way'."" BBC/Toffee International Ltd./Tom Jackson The series finale aired on Christmas Day 2024 During the trip Corden suggested it ""might be time"" to do more Gavin and Stacey. ""I came back from the Mexico trip in 2018 thinking 'right, lets do this',"" Jones says. As they were writing the 2019 finale, they had the idea of doing two specials, with one being a secret and storyline ideas including Gavin having an affair. ""So the first would air on Christmas Day and the second on New Year's Day, we even thought that the BBC could put something fake in the listings,"" Corden says. But the task was a ""big challenge"" because of the 10-year gap, and the pair thought it would not work. 5. The finale could have been a film in cinemas PA Media The co-creators originally saw the finale as a cinema film, before opting for a 90 minute tv episode The pair reveal that in August 2023 they started talking about doing one more, potentially a film to be released in cinemas - but changed their minds. Corden says: ""The fact is they've always been in the corner of your room and that is where they should remain."" Jones adds: ""When we started the show 20 years ago the idea it would be one of those shows that had a Christmas special was far beyond anything we hever dreamed of. ""Just the notion of BBC One on Christmas Day. That means so much to us."" Corden and Jones said the book came about because they felt it would be nice for fans of the show to find out what their relationship was like and also explore the journey that started back in 2000 in Leeds and ended in Barry last Christmas Corden says they wrote with the same freedom they always had and didn't tell the BBC until they had written 65 pages. The pair added they originally thought the 2019 special would be the ending, had it not had the cliffhanger. ""We knew it our hearts that the absolute had to be that Smithy and Nessa finally got together . Got married."" PA Media The Christmas Day episode in 2024 became one of the most watched scripted TV shows of the century Corden says without Jones passion for Gavin and Stacey he would have let the idea go by the wayside. He says: ""When I think about Gavin and Stacey I think about the word friend and what it means. ""I got to make this show with somebody who knows me better than I know myself...

d24fec2cd118,Celebrity Traitors episode two was as killer as Tom Daley's side-eye,,"Celebrity Traitors episode two was as killer as Tom Daley's side-eye Noor Nanji Culture reporter BBC / Celebrity Traitors Spoiler warning: This article reveals details from the second episode of the Celebrity Traitors The second episode of Celebrity Traitors has taken place and all we're talking about is Tom Daley giving Kate Garraway a serious side-eye. The presenter is suspect #1 for the Olympic diver, who made zero efforts to hide it during Thursday night's show. At one point, Garraway declares she is ""flabbergasted"" by the first murder. Daley has no time for it, giving a major eye roll. And he's not the only one who thinks Garraway could be a Traitor. Throughout the episode, Garraway was accused both by her fellow contestants and by fans online of ""over-acting"". For entertainment reporter Indigo Stafford, it seemed to suggest she was hiding something. Spoiler: she was not. Garraway explained her behaviour at the roundtable, where her name was repeatedly brought up by the other celebrities. Apparently, that's just how she is. ""I'm a massive ham,"" she said. Garraway wasn't the only one struggling with her acting skills. Alan Carr - the standout sensation of episode one - was still struggling to keep a straight face. As the first episode of the Celebrity Traitors drew to a close on Wednesday night, we were left waiting to find out which star would be murdered by Carr in plain sight. Would he go through with it? Our hearts, collectively as a nation, were in our mouths. But murder, he did. And the following morning at breakfast, as the rest of the players tried to work out what had happened, he was all over the place - scratching his head nervously, biting his fingers. ""It was a stretch for my acting ability, I don't know how Meryl Streep does it,"" he said. Entertainment reporter Indigo Stafford says they may be celebrities, but even so they're not immune from feeling the nerves - and that could explain their poor acting abilities. You can see why ""being in a game set around murder, betrayal and manipulation... would jangle your nerves,"" she explained. Elsewhere, fans online were relieved to know that celebrities are as bad as spelling as us. When Niko Omilana voted for Tom Daley, he spelled it the way some of us probably secretly thought it was spelled too - DAYLEE. ""Niko keeping the longstanding traitors tradition of terrible name spelling at the round table alive and well,"" wrote one X user, adding : ""It's officially Tom Daylee now, any other spelling will not be accepted."" The show ended on a cliffhanger - again - with fans having to wait till next week to find out who has been voted out. The Celebrity Traitors is on BBC One on Wednesdays and Thursdays at 21:00 BST and on BBC iPlayer . There will be nine episodes.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c1edwzpdlx4o,entertainment,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/a13d/live/7b8cde60-a558-11f0-928c-71dbb8619e94.jpg,2025-10-09T21:47:23.708000+00:00,f263bf77b32ac2dc011ef409d6cd104179844d55
e27347846934,"Universities risk sanctions over Gaza protests, watchdog says",,"Universities risk sanctions over Gaza protests, watchdog says Joshua Nevett Political reporter BBC Universities could face sanctions if pro-Palestinian protests descend into harassment and discrimination against Jewish students on campus, the free speech director at the watchdog for higher education in England has said. Arif Ahmed, from the Office for Students (OfS), told the BBC freedom of speech did not mean the freedom to intimidate, harass, and discriminate against Jewish students. He said he was concerned about antisemitism on campuses and warned universities the OfS was ""prepared to act"" if Jewish students were not protected. The regulator has the power to issue fines, cut off access to public funding and revoke the ability to award degrees if universities breach its rules. Mr Ahmed - who champions free speech on campuses in his role - spoke to the BBC's Political Thinking podcast following a wave of pro-Palestinian protests on the second anniversary of the 7 October Hamas attack on Israel. The protests went ahead despite the pleas of Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer, who urged students not to take part , warning of ""rising antisemitism on our streets"". Sir Keir said it was ""un-British to have little respect for others"" by staging demonstrations on the anniversary and argued the protests had been used by some as a ""despicable excuse to attack British Jews"". Students from London universities took part in a joint march on 7 October, while rallies took place in Edinburgh, Belfast and Sheffield. Protest group UCL Action For Palestine, which took part in the London march, posted on social media that it would not be ""silenced or intimidated"" and stood in solidarity with the thousands of Palestinians killed before and prior to October 2023. The protests came days after two Jewish men were killed in a terrorist attack at a Manchester synagogue on Yom Kippur. Security has been stepped up at synagogues across the country in response to the attack. In his interview with Political Thinking, Mr Ahmed said he was concerned about the protests on 7 October and antisemitism against Jewish students. ""Universities and colleges also have a duty to take steps to protect students from harassment and that includes antisemitic harassment,"" he said. ""And we in the OfS will be prepared to act if we think universities are not meeting those duties."" He said if there was ""unlawful support for proscribed organisations"" on campus ""then that's absolutely not something that freedom of speech protects and it is something that we would expect universities to address"". Universities and colleges must be registered with the OfS if they want certain benefits, including access to student loan funding. If universities are deemed to have breached the conditions of registration, they can be sanctioned by the OfS. In March this year, the University of Sussex was fined £585,000 by the OfS for failing to uphold freedom of speech . The OfS said the university's policy statement on trans and non-binary equality, including a requirement to ""positively represent trans people"", could lead to staff and students preventing themselves from voicing opposing views. Risk of political violence In an earlier interview with Political Thinking, Mr Ahmed said the assassination of American conservative activist Charlie Kirk was ""an appalling tragedy"" and warned democracy would not survive if differences could not be settled through speech. ""You must allow people to express their views on really controversial topics, because alternatively, there will be no alternative to violence,"" Mr Ahmed said. ""And that will be the abyss that we end up falling into."" Mr Ahmed also said the OfS was ""ready to act"" to punish universities for not protecting academics and students from harassment and intimidation from foreign dictatorships. Mr Ahmed said he had seen evidence of visiting foreign scholars threatening academics in the UK, whispering in their ears ""we're following you, we're watching you"". He said: ""If your business model involves breaking the law, if your business model involves unlawfully suppressing academic freedom and freedom of speech at the behest of a foreign dictatorship, then you need another business model."" Mr Ahmed said the OfS had powers to force universities to take action. ""We can remove their titles to universities. We can fine them. We can ultimately cut off their access to public funding.""

63e720077700,"Plaid ready to replace Welsh Labour, says leader",,"Plaid ready to replace Welsh Labour, says leader David Deans Wales political reporter Getty Images Rhun ap Iorwerth has been leader of Plaid Cymru since 2023 Plaid Cymru is ready to replace Welsh Labour at the next Senedd election, leader Rhun ap Iorwerth will say later. At their annual conference the party leader will promise that he can deliver a ""new government, with new energy and new ideas"". Labour has led Wales since the start of devolution in 1999, and has dominated Welsh politics for a century. The next election takes place in May. ""Change now seems inevitable,"" he will say, calling on voters to back his party if they want to stop Nigel Farage's Reform UK from winning the election. Plaid Cymru has played a key role during the life of devolution, being an occasional supporter of Labour governments. It has been unable to beat Labour in an election - but recent opinion polling has suggested Plaid is vying with the party to win, as is Reform. Rhun ap Iorwerth is now trying to position his party as a government-in-waiting. Even if Plaid came first it is possible they would have to work with Labour or other parties in some form, with no party having ever won a majority in the Senedd. The party leader will tell his conference: ""Today, with a historic nation-building opportunity before us, I'm going to set out the choice facing Wales - two very different futures but only one credible option. ""Let's be clear. We're not here to act as Labour's conscience. We are not here to repair Labour. We are here to replace them. ""We promise a new government, with new energy and new ideas to prove what every person who believes in Wales already knows - that things don't have to be this way."" With some exceptions, Plaid Cymru has traditionally had more support in the Welsh-speaking heartlands of north and west Wales. Ap Iorwerth says his government will be on the side of ""young and old, urban and rural, north and south, Welsh speaker [and] non-Welsh speaker"". ""The time is now to stop Reform and elect a government more radical, more ambitious, more impatient to bring about positive change than any which has gone before it,"" he will say. Analysis Plaid Cymru is trying to position itself as the leading anti-Reform party for the next Senedd election - with Rhun ap Iorwerth as Wales' next first minister. It sees Nigel Farage's party as its main competitor, rather than Labour, reflecting how they feel the UK political climate has changed since the last general election. Despite being pro-independence, for them the 2026 vote will not be an independence election, and the issue is unlikely to be front and centre of its pitch as it tries to reach beyond its usual base. So far it is not promising wholesale scrapping and rebuilding of how Wales works - something they think is risky in the current financial climate - although the party stresses it will still offer ""radical"" policies. An example of that, the party would argue, is its promise of a payment to tackle child poverty. Plaid faces a challenge in how they convince voters on the left to switch to them in an election fought with a new voting system designed to give people more choice. The Greens and the Welsh Lib Dems will be among those hoping to motivate voters who want to put a roadblock in the way of Reform - as is Labour. It will also be competing with a Reform party with lots of money and wide media coverage - two things Plaid has always struggled with.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cewnv2xprzko,politics,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/846a/live/3e30fae0-a541-11f0-8303-d57b048c793f.jpg,2025-10-10T05:03:17.494000+00:00,14eb529566380d947273bde049de58ac067738a6

Judge Jeannette Vargas ruled Lamar's lyrics, which accused Drake and his associates of being ""certified paedophiles"", were ""nonactionable opinion"" and could not be considered defamatory. Drake filed the lawsuit in January accusing Universal Music Group (UMG), the record label behind both rappers, of defamation by allowing the song to be published and promoted, saying it spread a ""false and malicious narrative"". Drake's spokesperson said he planned to appeal the ruling. UMG said it was pleased with the outcome and was looking forward to continuing its work with the rapper. Not Like Us, which was initially released in May 2024, was widely seen as the decisive blow in an ongoing battle between the rival rappers. It has become the biggest hit of Lamar's career, having won five Grammys and being one of the most-talked about moments of his Super Bowl half-time show in February. In a 38-page order, Judge Vargas called the row between the rappers ""the most infamous rap battle in the genre's history"". ""The artists' seven-track rap battle was a 'war of words' that was the subject of substantial media scrutiny and online discourse,"" the judge wrote. Getty Images Kendrick Lamar performed Not Like Us during the 2025 Super Bowl half-time show in New Orleans, Louisiana. ""Although the accusation that plaintiff is a pedophile is certainly a serious one, the broader context of a heated rap battle, with incendiary language and offensive accusations hurled by both participants, would not incline the reasonable listener to believe that 'Not Like Us' imparts verifiable facts about plaintiff."" Drake, whose real name is Aubrey Graham, did not name Lamar in the lawsuit. His lawyers accused UMG of launching ""a campaign to create a viral hit"" out of a song that made the ""false factual allegation that Drake is a criminal paedophile, and to suggest that the public should resort to vigilante justice in response"". A UMG spokesperson told the BBC's US media partner, CBS News, that from the outset, the lawsuit ""was an affront to all artists and their creative expression and never should have seen the light of day"". ""We're pleased with the court's dismissal and look forward to continuing our work successfully promoting Drake's music and investing in his career,"" the spokesperson added.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cd9y104g7kno,entertainment,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/1f89/live/07662db0-a57c-11f0-932a-517a47de911e.jpg,2025-10-10T03:44:19.696000+00:00,e558c6b1e6bf8c1cc6392a15be4d2a8d7d90fc1b

Mr Clarke said he got on with his dance partner ""immediately"" and that he has enjoyed doing something his family can enjoy. ""My nan is over the moon. When I called her [to say he was doing the show], she was like 'Oh that's really cool',"" he told BBC Radio Bristol. The star has also revealed he injured his back during rehearsals. Speaking on his podcast, The Useless Hotline Podcast, he said: ""I had a pinched nerve all week in my back. I had acupuncture."" But he was still able to perform on Saturday night and has been back to his intense rehearsal schedule this week. George Clarke said there was no doubt he would say yes to appearing on Strictly Mr Clarke told BBC Radio Bristol there was no doubt he would say 'yes' to appearing on Strictly when he was contacted in May. ""I've always said there's two or maybe three TV shows that I feel like I couldn't say no to, and Strictly was definitely one of them,"" he said. Mr Clarke, who has no dance experience, said while he is trying to ""embrace it"" as much as he can, he soon found out the show would be a lot harder work than he initially thought. He said he had sometimes ""struggled to find strengths"" to his dancing but ""when something clicks it feels very satisfying"". Mr Clarke said he was enjoying doing something his grandparents could relate to and enjoy. While he now lives in London, Mr Clarke told the BBC he will ""always feel like a Bristol boy at heart"".

642ecef9b0ef,Huge buzz but a big gamble: Battlefield 6 takes aim at Call of Duty,,"Huge buzz but a big gamble: Battlefield 6 takes aim at Call of Duty Georgia Levy-Collins BBC Newsbeat EA Battlefield 6 has its sights on success - but can it hit its target? ""A new challenger has appeared."" In the fiercely competitive world of video games, it's common for new contenders to fade away as quickly as they burst on to the scene. But Battlefield 6 is hoping to change that. It's the latest entry in a long-running military shooter series often framed as a grittier, more realistic answer to Call of Duty. The title's never quite managed to match its most famous rival in terms of sales or players, but there are signs the new installment could close the gap. A preview weekend giving players a chance to try out the game earlier this year broke records, and the buzz heading into its launch has been huge. But the project is still a big gamble for publisher Electronic Arts (EA), which has reportedly spent hundreds of millions of dollars making it. BBC Newsbeat's spoken to some of the makers to find out how they hope it will pay off. Four EA-owned studios have been working on the game under the Battlefield Studios banner. They include original series developer Dice, based in Sweden, LA's Motive Studios and Ripple Effect Studios in Canada. The fourth, Criterion, is based in Guildford in the UK. Rebecka Coutaz is the general manager of the two European studios and tells Newsbeat that, in terms of what it's offering players, ""Battlefield 6 is probably unbeatable"". EA Rebecka Coutaz is in charge of Battlefield's European studios The game comes off the back of the futuristic Battlefield 2042, released four years ago to a negative reception it struggled to recover from. ""We probably couldn't make and develop Battlefield 6 without the learnings we had in Battlefield 2042,"" Rebekah tells Newsbeat. One of those lessons was to get fans involved early, and the team launched invite-only community playtests earlier this year. Rebecka says the ""feedback was explosively positive"". Another missing ingredient from Battlefield 2042 was a single-player campaign, which has been restored this time around. Criterion design director Fasahat 'Fas' Salim is the one in charge of ""making sure those missions are as fun and interesting as possible for the players"". Despite claims that the scale of the project had put a strain on the different studios collaborating across continents to build the game, Fas is positive about the process. ""Collaborating with different cultures, different backgrounds, it's a really interesting environment to be involved in every day,"" he says. ""This whole approach has been something new but something really exciting because we are working with people from all over the world."" As for the expectation on the team, Fas says: ""There is pressure but also it's exciting. ""It's a big project. It's probably the biggest that most of us have ever worked on."" Vlad is completing his BA in Visual Effects at Bournemouth University alongside his role at Criterion That's definitely true of at least one team member, lighting artist Vlad Kokhan. The 21-year-old makes the atmospheric effects that shape the mood, tone, and direction of the single-player campaign. He completed an internship at Criterion before getting a job there, and currently works part-time while finishing his visual effects degree at Bournemouth University. Vlad says he's a long-time fan of the Battlefield series, and remembers playing the fourth instalment of the series at a friend's house when he was younger. To be working on it now, as his first industry job, ""doesn't feel real"". ""It's really crazy seeing the marketing everywhere,"" he says. ""To know that I've put my own thing into the game is really surreal."" A hand-painted mural of the game at EA's Guildford office Battlefield 6's launch is expected to be a big one, with analysts predicting it could sell up to five millions copies in its first week . But its real success in a volatile and unpredictable industry won't be clear for months, if not years. To maintain the momentum, it will need to draw - and keep - players away from rivals including CoD, Fortnite and Roblox. But while the signs are promising, Rebecka is cautious when asked if she is feeling confident. ""I would say yes and no, you never know,"" she says. ""The only thing that matters to me now - and I've been saying it for four years - is that we don't disappoint our community, our players."" Concerns for Battlefield's future were also sparked by recent news that EA had agreed to sell the company to a Saudi Arabia-led group for $55bn (£41bn) . EA has taken on $20bn (£14bn) of debt as part of the deal - known as a leveraged buyout - prompting fans to fear of cutbacks. The company has told staff to expect ""no immediate changes"" to their jobs. For Battlefield 6, Rebecka tells Newsbeat the team will continue as planned, and has already shared details for monthly updates and content additions. ""I am here to help our team members make their best work in their careers so the way hasn't changed for me, the way is still the same,"" she insists. Fas is responsible for the single-player missions in the new game EA has been vocal about its plans to use generative AI in game development, and its prospective new owners are betting on the technology to boost profits, according to The Financial Times . The tools are controversial, prompting concerns from developers and backlash from some fans. Rebecka tells Newsbeat players won't see anything made by GenAI within Battlefield 6, but it is used in preparatory stages to ""to allow more time and more space to be creative"". Rebecka says GenAI ""is very seducing"", but there isn't currently a way to incorporate it into developer's daily work. Yet she shares EA's optimism for its potential. ""If we can break the magic with AI it will help us be more innovative and more creative,"" she says. In Fas's opinion, GenAI is ""not anything to be scared of in our industry"". ""Especially as we work in an environment at the bleeding edge of technology - we're kind of used to things changing,"" he says. ""It's just a matter of how we can incorporate that productively into our workflows, how can we leverage that to take our games to the next level."" For now, though, the team's focus is on nailing Battlefield 6's release. ""We spend a lot of time behind closed doors making these things,"" says Fas. ""But when it goes into the players' hands and you see them having a great time, people shouting, people excited, that's something that we worked years for. ""This is what most of us game developers look forward to. We just want to see people play the thing and then get excited about it.""

Caroline Clapper, who sits on both Hertfordshire County and Hertsmere Borough councils, said a by-election would incur ""a significant and unnecessary cost to the taxpayer"". Fellow defector Brett Rosehill said other councillors had switched parties and this was the first time demands had been made for a by-election. Clapper also said there was no precedent for a poll being called following a politician's move to a different party. Steve Fraser Steve Fraser, a Hertsmere voter, says councillors who change party should resign and contest a by-election Steve Fraser, who lives in Potters Bar, said: ""When our councillors decide to change parties part way through their term of office, they should resign so that an election is held. ""Most people intend their vote for a party in the election, rather than for the particular person standing. ""So, if someone decides to change party part way through their term it's only fair that they should resign and, if they like, stand again in their new colours."" On social media, Carol Ripley said: ""Sorry but this is just not fair on voters who elected this councillor."" In the county council elections earlier this year, Clapper received 67% of the vote for the Conservatives in Watling ward. The Reform UK candidate in the same ward came second with just 16%, but that result may not necessarily be replicated in a by-election.

""It is not a decision I have taken lightly. ""However, in local elections people vote first and foremost for the individual candidate they trust to work hard for them. ""There is no precedent for councillors standing down and calling a by-election after changing party affiliation, and such a move would incur a significant and unnecessary cost to the taxpayer.""

The letter came after online posts appeared to link candidate Llŷr Powell to Russian president Vladimir Putin - an accusation the party strongly denies. Reform also objected to references that suggested former Reform Wales leader Nathan Gill had taken bribes. Last month, the 52-year-old from Llangefni, Anglesey, admitted eight counts of bribery between 6 December 2018 and 18 July 2019. The dispute comes ahead of the Caerphilly by-election on 23 October, where the candidates are: Richard Tunnicliffe (Welsh Labour), Lindsay Whittle (Plaid Cymru), Gareth Potter (Welsh Conservatives), Llŷr Powell (Reform UK), Gareth Hughes (Wales Green Party) Steven Aicheler (Welsh Liberal Democrats), Roger Quilliam (UKIP), Anthony Cook (Gwlad).",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx203vp909go,politics,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/1bb6/live/d0865cf0-a479-11f0-b741-177e3e2c2fc7.jpg,2025-10-09T07:48:08.741000+00:00,5b28432c1dc2fa22ac934840f3807f9b0b6e5970

There has been a backlash to Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer's announcement that a UK-wide digital ID scheme will be introduced before 2029, with a petition attracting nearly three million signatures. An official government response to that petition confirmed the consultation will also consider whether to include children aged 13 years old and older. Home Secretary Yvette Cooper defended the consultation plans, saying ""lots of 13-year olds already do"" have a form of digital ID. The UK Parliament petition opposes the creation of any national ID system and demands the government ditch its plans, which petitioners claim ""would be a step towards mass surveillance and digital control"". The number of signatures means the issue will be debated by MPs in the coming weeks and has also received an official government response, confirming plans to introduce digital ID ""to help tackle illegal migration, make accessing government services easier, and enable wider efficiencies"". The statement says: ""This is not a card but a new digital identity that will be available for free to all UK citizens and legal residents aged 16 and over (although we will consider through consultation if this should be age 13 and over). ""Over time, people will be able to use it to seamlessly access a range of public and private sector services, with the aim of making our everyday lives easier and more secure. ""It will not be compulsory to obtain a digital ID but it will be mandatory for some applications."" Defending the plans to consider the inclusion of 13 to 16-year-olds in the scheme, Cooper told LBC: ""Everybody has forms of digital ID... We all have different ways of having to prove who we are. ""Lots of 13-year-olds already do [have a form of digital ID], and what the department is going to be consulting on is exactly how that should be taken forward. ""I do think that this is the right way forward, to have this standardised process now, and it's something that we had been already setting out for people who come to work from abroad."" During a trip to India this week , Sir Keir praised the country's Aadhaar digital ID system, which is far more extensive than the plans initially announced for the UK and involves the storing of biometric data, as a ""massive success"". He signalled Britain could use the technology for services like banking, pointing to New Delhi's scheme as an example, and said ministers must ""make the case"" for the ""huge benefits"" the scheme could offer. No 10 said Britain's system would not necessarily copy India's biometric data usage and signalled the UK scheme would be run by the public sector. Other countries that already have digital ID systems include Estonia, Demark and Spain, as well as Canada, Australia and Japan.

East Wiltshire MP Danny Kruger became the first sitting Conservative MP to defect to the party last month and has now written to his 71,000-strong electorate to explain why. He explained he had ""jumped ship"" because of what he claimed were Tory ""failures"" on issues such as mass migration and Brexit, which he believes led to a loss of confidence in the party. The Conservative Party has been contacted for comment on Mr Kruger's claims. Mr Kruger said his former party was ""rightly and naturally punished for its record"" at the 2024 election in the letter, which was sent to every constituency household. He said: ""I was elected in 2019 to 'get Brexit done' and then – as Boris always stressed – to move beyond Brexit and fix the underlying problems with our country. ""We did the Brexit bit, but then we failed. Most of all, we failed to control our borders and reduce taxes as we had promised. ""Many of our communities have experienced huge and unwelcome change due to mass migration."" He further described his unhappiness at the armed forces being ""hollowed out"", the ""highly precarious"" nature of the economy, and said public services were ""at the brink of collapse"", despite spending increases. Following his defection, Mr Kruger was criticised for not calling a by-election by both the leader of the Conservatives on Wiltshire Council, Richard Clewer, and Melksham and Devizes Conservative Association chair Brian Burchfield. Mr Burchfield said Mr Kruger's constituents ""deserve the opportunity to choose their Member of Parliament based on the party they stood for at election – not one they've opted to switch to mid-term"".

The ER and Doctor Who star, who is currently competing on Strictly Come Dancing, told the Independent she had a hysterectomy and radiation therapy during her treatment, which finished late last year. ""I had assumed that the way I was feeling was old age, and I just sort of accepted it,"" Kingston, 62, said. ""I thought, 'OK, this is what it's like to be in my sixties.' But a lot of how I was feeling was to do with my illness."" Getty Images Kingston is known for playing River Song in Doctor Who and Dr Elizabeth Corday in ER Kingston said she had been experiencing bloating and aches for some time, but only sought medical help after spotting blood in her urine. ""I never went down the cancer road in my head,"" she said. ""It was a shock, because I have a very positive outlook on life in general. ""Even though my body was telling me there was something very seriously wrong, I kept thinking, 'Oh, I've got a bad UTI or fibroids.'"" She explained that her 2024 was dominated by the diagnosis and subsequent treatment. ""I had a major operation,"" she told the newspaper. ""I had to have a hysterectomy, I had to go into radiation therapy, and that took up a huge part of my life."" The actress recalled that she had suffered a haemorrhage while on stage at Chichester Festival Theatre, something she described as ""shocking"". She appeared in The Other Boleyn Girl at the West Sussex theatre in April and May 2024. After seeking medical attention following the show's run, Kingston was told the cancer was in her fallopian tubes but had not spread to the ovaries. ""The minute I had the operation, I suddenly felt like myself again,"" Kingston said. The actress urged other women not to ignore any signs of ill health, and to have check-ups if they feel anything is wrong. Kingston played River Song in BBC One sci-fi series Doctor Who from 2008 to 2015, and starred in US medical drama ER for more than a decade as Dr Elizabeth Corday. She is currently taking part in Strictly with professional dance partner Johannes Radebe, and the pair topped the leaderboard last week with their samba. The actress said it was her experience last year that inspired her to say yes to the dancing show, because ""life is too short"" not to take opportunities you want.

65453694efa5,"No plans to send UK troops to monitor Gaza ceasefire, says Cooper",,"No plans to send UK troops to monitor Gaza ceasefire, says Cooper Getty Images UK Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper has said there are ""no plans"" to send British troops to be part of a multinational force that will monitor the Gaza ceasefire from Israel. The first phase of a deal with Hamas that will lead to a ceasefire and the release of hostages has been approved by Israel and has now come into effect, according to its military. Cooper, who is meeting foreign ministers in Paris, said the UK will continue to support the peace process in other ways, including looking at getting private finance into Gaza. ""This is still a fragile process but it is one there is a huge momentum behind and a huge commitment to, so we have to make it work,"" she said. The US is moving up to 200 troops already based in the Middle East to Israel to coordinate what it is calling a civil-military coordination centre in Israel, according to US officials. This is intended to oversee the progress of the ceasefire agreement and to help coordinate humanitarian assistance. Forces from Arab and Muslim countries, including Egypt, Qatar, and Turkey, will also be involved, helping to observe the truce and report any violations. US officials said that no American forces would enter Gaza. Asked on BBC Breakfast on Friday whether UK troops would be involved, Cooper said: ""That's not our plan, there's no plans to do that."" The foreign secretary was also asked about Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's recent comments in an interview with Euronews, that Europe had ""essentially become irrelevant"" in ceasefire plans, and said the decision by countries, including the UK, to recognise a Palestinian state had been an ""ultimate reward (to) Islamists"". Cooper replied that the UK has had disagreements with Israel over this issue but that ""the point now is that we need countries coming together to make peace a reality and to actually make it happen"". She insisted that the UK has ""already contributed"" to get to this point in the peace process, including by putting forward proposals as part of a framework for peace and through the recognition of a Palestinian state. Cooper said that moving forward, the UK would be involved in talks with Arab states over ways to get financial investment into Gaza, which has been devastated by two years of Israeli bombardment. More than 67,000 Palestinians, mostly civilians, have been killed in Israel's military offensive according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry. Israel launched its military offensive in response to the Hamas attacks on 7 October 2023, when around 1,200 people were killed, mostly Israeli civilians, and 251 were taken hostage. Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has also emphasised the UK's role in peace negotiations, and said on Thursday that the country had ""played an important part behind the scenes"". Speaking at a press conference on a visit to Mumbai, he added that the UK now ""stands ready to play our part in implementing this [the peace plan], again with others, as we go forward"". Cooper flew to Paris on Thursday from Northern Ireland with her German counterpart. Both ministers had been attending a meeting of foreign ministers from the Western Balkans at Hillsborough Castle near Belfast. She told the BBC's Today programme on Friday that they had held discussions about the lessons learned during the implementation of peace processes in their own countries in recent decades. ""What we know is that countries can come together to support peace, to resolve conflict, to rebuild nations,"" she said, and added that she believed the reflections could help in Gaza. Meanwhile, Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey said the UK must play a ""maximum role"" in maintaining the ceasefire.

930e5cfd2f96,Farage 'stunned' ex-Wales Reform leader took bribes,,"Farage 'stunned' ex-Wales Reform leader took bribes Adrian Browne Wales political reporter and Dan Moffat BBC Wales Getty Images Reform UK leader Nigel Farage has said he was ""stunned"" when he found out his party's former leader in Wales took bribes to make statements in favour of Russia while a Member of the European Parliament. Last month, Nathan Gill, pleaded guilty to eight counts of bribery between 6 December 2018 and 18 July 2019. Asked, by BBC Wales, if he questioned Gill over the statements, Farage said: ""I didn't know anything about it, all I knew was that he'd been to Ukraine."" ""I told him not to go, he defied me and went, I was completely unaware of any statements that he made."" Gill, who is no longer a Reform member, also used to be a politician in Cardiff Bay. He was one of seven UKIP politicians elected to the Senedd in 2016 when the party was led by Farage. Gill took money from Oleg Voloshyn, once described by the US government as a ""pawn"" of Russian secret services, and made pro-Russian speeches in the European Parliament, statements to a TV channel and arranged an event with a politician close to Moscow. Mr Voloshyn is a former member of the Ukrainian parliament for the pro-Russian Opposition Platform for Life party. Gill's activities emerged in WhatsApp messages on his phone after he was stopped at Manchester Airport on September 13 2021 under counter-terrorism laws. On a campaign visit, on Friday, for the upcoming Caerphilly Senedd by-election, Farage responded publicly for the first time to the Gill bribery case. ""I'd known this person for a very long time, I knew him in the European Parliament in the UKIP days to be a God-fearing Christian, somebody that you would think was the least corruptible person that you would know,"" he said. Asked if he knew about Gill making pro-Russian statements, Farage said: ""I didn't know anything about it."" ""All I knew was that he'd been to Ukraine. He said 'we're going on a visit to Ukraine, do you want to come?' ""I said 'you're off your rocker, this is one of the most corrupt countries in the world,  you must be mad'. And I told him not to go. ""He defied me and went. I was completely unaware of any statements that he made."" Gill served as a UKIP, and later Brexit Party, MEP between 2014 and 2020 and was leader of UKIP Wales between 2014 and 2016. He was leader of Reform UK Wales between March and May 2021, leading the party's Senedd/Welsh Parliament election campaign but is no longer in the party. Gill will be sentenced in November. His defence barrister has said he expects to be jailed. Nigel Farage campaigned alongside Nathan Gill (in red and white striped tie) in Caerphilly in 2019 for the European elections The Caerphilly Senedd by-election, prompted by the sudden death of Labour Senedd member Hefin David in August, takes place on 23 October.

9ba907854b4c,Lib Dems back Bank of England after Farage criticism,,"The Liberal Democrats have promised to back the Bank of England's (BoE) independence ""against Farage's threats"" after the Reform leader urged it to end its bond-selling programme. On Friday, party leader Sir Ed Davey and his deputy Daisy Cooper met the bank's governor Andrew Bailey to ""reaffirm support"" for the Bank's autonomy. It comes two weeks after Nigel Farage met Mr Bailey to argue for the end of BoE bond sales, known as quantitative tightening, claiming it is costing taxpayers billions and driving up debt. Sir Ed accused Farage of ""putting his obsession with mimicking Donald Trump ahead of what is in the best interests of the British people"" by pressuring the central bank. Reform UK has been approached for comment. Sir Ed has pledged to lead the fight against Reform UK - using his Lib Dem conference speech to argue his party had a ""moral responsibility"" to challenge Farage. Speaking after his meeting at the Bank's Threadneedle Street HQ, Sir Ed said: ""Liberal Democrats will stand firmly behind Bank of England independence, just as we have stood against recent attacks on the independence of our judiciary. ""Trump's threats to sack governors of the Fed if they don't do what he wants are causing economic panic in the United States,"" Sir Ed said. ""That is the last thing we need here at home - we cannot let Trump's America become Farage's Britain."" Speaking to reporters later, Sir Ed argued the BoE needed ""modernisation"" but argued keeping it independent from government was ""the best way"" to lower food bills and mortgage rates. The Bank began its quantitative tightening programme in 2022 , unwinding the emergency support it brought in after the 2008 financial crisis. That earlier process, known as quantitative easing, saw the Bank electronically create billions of pounds to buy UK government bonds, a form of debt, in a bid to prop up the UK economy by keeping market interest rates low. The Bank subsequently launched new rounds of QE after the eurozone debt crisis, the Brexit referendum and the coronavirus pandemic. The Bank is now in the process of selling these bonds for less than it paid for them, with losses being picked up by the Treasury under a deal agreed in 2009. Reform has criticised the process, with deputy leader Richard Tice branding it a ""systemic misuse of taxpayers' money"" in a letter to Bailey in June. He also blamed it for increasing the costs of long-term government debt, which recently rose to a 27-year high. Farage and Tice visited the Bank for talks with Bailey on 25 September, after the Bank chief agreed to a meeting. Speaking to reporters afterwards, Tice called for MPs to take a more active role in debating the policy, arguing they were reluctant to do so for fear of encroaching on the bank's independence. But he added that the ""huge multibillion cost"" meant it had an impact on taxation, traditionally a matter for Parliament, and could ""change the decisions the chancellor makes"" at November's Budget. They also pressed the Bank to relax its stance on cryptocurrencies, accusing it of holding back innovation.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cr70g372m91o,politics,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/2f8b/live/711129e0-a5d6-11f0-b98a-8b079c99c55e.jpg,2025-10-10T12:42:29.008000+00:00,3541b736e9fabbb59610cfe31eab6e6dcb8a8f9e
d3bc42e292f4,What are National Insurance and income tax and what could change in the Budget?,,"What are National Insurance and income tax and what could change in the Budget? Getty Images There has been speculation that November's Budget could see Chancellor Rachel Reeves break Labour's pre-election pledge not to increase income tax, National Insurance (NI) or VAT for working people. It's been suggested that she could extend a freeze to the income thresholds at which people start paying the taxes, or have to pay more. What is National Insurance and what does it pay for? The government uses National Insurance to pay benefits and help fund the NHS. It is paid by employees, employers and the self-employed across the UK. Those over the state pension age do not pay it, even if they are working. Eligibility for some benefits, including the state pension, depends on the National Insurance contributions (NICs) you make across your working life. It may be possible to make voluntary payments to fill gaps in your contribution history. How much do employees pay in National Insurance? The type and amount of NI you pay depends on your age, employment status and income. Workers start paying NI when they turn 16 and earn more than £242 a week, or have self-employed profits of more than £12,570 a year. The amount owed is usually deducted automatically from employees' wages along with income tax. The starting rate for NI for employees fell twice in 2024: from 12% to 10%, and then again to 8%. The previous Conservative government said these cuts were worth about £900 a year for a worker earning £35,000. For the self-employed , the rate of NI paid on all earnings between £12,570 and £50,270 fell from 9% to 6%. This was said to be worth £350 to a self-employed person earning £28,200. Most self-employed people pay their NICs through their self assessment tax return . The NI rate on income and profits above £50,270 is 2% for all workers. How much do employers pay in National Insurance? Since April 2025, employers pay NI at 15% on most employees' wages above £5,000. They previously paid 13.8% on salaries above £9,100. Businesses also pay 15% NI on expenses and benefits they give to their staff - such as company cars or health insurance. The employment allowance - the amount employers can claim back from their NI bill - rose from £5,000 to £10,500. What are the current income tax rates? You have to pay income tax on your earnings from employment, or profits from self-employment, above the tax-free personal allowance of £12,570. Income tax is also paid on some benefits and pensions , income from renting out property, and returns from savings and investments above certain limits. The basic rate of 20% is paid on annual earnings between £12,571 and £50,270. The higher rate of 40% is paid on earnings between £50,271 and £125,140. Once you earn more than £100,000, you also start losing the £12,570 tax-free personal allowance . You lose £1 of your personal allowance for every £2 that your income goes above £100,000. Anyone earning more than £125,140 a year no longer has any tax-free personal allowance. They also pay an additional rate of income tax of 45% on all earnings above that amount. These rates apply in England, Wales and Northern Ireland. Some income tax rates are different in Scotland , where a new 45% band took effect in April 2024. At the same time the top rate also rose from 47% to 48%. What are NI and income tax thresholds and why do they matter? Changes to the income thresholds mean that millions are paying more tax overall, despite the 2024 NI cuts. The thresholds are the income levels at which people start paying NI or income tax, or have to pay higher rates. These used to rise every year in line with inflation. However, the previous Conservative government froze the NI threshold and tax-free personal allowance at £12,570 until 2028.  It also kept the higher-rate tax threshold at £50,270. Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer and the chancellor have both refused to rule out extending the current freeze. Freezing the thresholds means that more people start paying tax and NI as their wages increase, and more people pay higher rates. According to the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) think thank, the freeze cancelled out the benefits of the 2024 NI cuts for some workers. In the 2024-25 tax year, it said an average earner would have a tax cut of about £340 - from the combined tax changes - and people earning between £26,000 and £60,000 would be better off. But by 2027, it said the average earner would be only £140 better off - and only people earning between £32,000 and £55,000 a year would still benefit.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c62q51vl18yo,politics,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/d97b/live/fd25fee0-9f93-11f0-b9ae-cbef91e6ae73.jpg,2025-10-10T11:20:32.625000+00:00,34e24c994f13b36c8695c045fbce17ffa3b293c8

Wallace is taking legal action against the BBC and BBC Studios after being sacked from the cooking show in July. His dismissal followed a report that upheld more than 40 allegations about his conduct on MasterChef, including one of unwelcome physical contact and three of being in a state of undress. Wallace previously said he was ""deeply sorry for any distress"" he caused and that he ""never set out to harm or humiliate"". The BBC and BBC Studios say they won't be commenting on ongoing legal proceedings. BBC News is editorially independent from the wider corporation. In the court documents filed at the High Court, which have been seen by BBC News, Wallace's lawyer claims that, in March, Wallace requested ""personal data"" from both the BBC and its subsidiary, BBC Studios, under data protection laws. Both requests for data related to his ""work, contractual relations and conduct"" spanning 21 years. In the court documents, Wallace's lawyer, Lawrence Power, claims that the BBC considered his request to be ""complex"" and as such requested an extension to the usual one month deadline to provide such information. In August, the documents say, the BBC emailed Wallace to apologise for the delay and said they were ""taking all reasonable steps"" to process the request in ""a timely manner"" but he still has not received a response. The documents further claim that BBC Studios told Wallace it was withholding parts of his data on the basis of ""freedom of expression"". But Wallace's lawyer claimed that it had ""unlawfully failed to supply all of the claimant's personal data"" and had ""wrongly redacted"" information. ""By reason of the defendants failing to fully comply with the [subject access request] made by the claimant for his own personal data, the defendants acted in breach of their statutory duty and in doing so caused distress and harassment to the claimant,"" he said. He stated Mr Wallace was seeking damages for ""distress, harassment and loss of amenity not exceeding £10,000"" as well as interest. Wallace is also seeking a court order that the BBC and BBC Studios comply with the requests for his data. The BBC and BBC Studios have not yet filed a defence to the claim. Wallace's representatives have been approached for a comment. BBC/Shine TV Gregg Wallace had hosted MasterChef for 20 years, but stepped away from presenting the show last year after facing a string of misconduct claims. The show's production company Banijay ordered an immediate inquiry into the allegations, which was conducted by an independent law firm. This summer, the law firm’s report revealed that 45 claims against Wallace had been substantiated. In total, the report said 83 allegations were made against the TV presenter, with the majority of the upheld claims relating to inappropriate sexual language and humour, but also culturally insensitive or racist comments. Following that report, Wallace issued a statement to the PA news agency, saying that ""none of the serious allegations against me were upheld"". A separate claim that his co-host John Torode had used a severely offensive racist term was also substantiated. Torode has said he has ""no recollection"" of the incident.

Khan had a ""very large presence online"" with his videos on TikTok under the username ""madapasa"", amassing hundreds of thousands of views. PA Media Reform UK leader Nigel Farage went to Southwark Crown Court to give evidence during Khan's trial Prosecutor Peter Ratliff said Khan's videos showed his attempts to come to the UK by small boat from Afghanistan. On 12 October, Farage uploaded a video to YouTube titled ""the journey of an illegal migrant"" which highlighted Khan and referenced ""young males of fighting age coming into our country about whom we know very little"". Mr Ratliff said Khan responded with a video on 14 October, which was played to the jury, in which Khan addressed the Reform UK MP as ""Englishman Nigel"". The video continued: ""You not know me. I come to England because I want to marry with your sister. You not know me. ""Don't talk about me more. Delete the video. ""I'm coming to England. I'm going to pop, pop, pop."" Mr Ratliff told the jury that while Khan said ""pop, pop, pop"" he had made ""gun gestures"" with his hand and headbutted the camera. 'Pretty chilling' Khan, an Afghan migrant, had also pointed towards an AK-47 tattoo on his face to ""emphasise he wasn't joking"". The prosecutor added: ""If you've got an AK-47 tattooed on your arm and your face, it's because you love AK-47s and you want the world to know that."" Farage, the MP for Clacton in Essex, gave evidence on Tuesday and said Khan's video was ""pretty chilling"", adding: ""Given his proximity to guns and love of guns, I was genuinely worried."" The Reform UK leader added: ""He says he's coming to England and he's going to shoot me."" Jurors were shown other videos posted on social media by Khan in which he appeared to make ""pop, pop, pop"" noises and similar hand gestures to those in the TikTok video referencing Farage. Metropolitan Police Khan came to the UK on a small boat last year from Afghanistan Khan was not called to give evidence on Wednesday by defence lawyer Charles Royle, but in a police interview last year he had said: ""It was never my intention to kill him or anything. ""This is my character, this is how I act in my videos."" Khan said: ""In every video I make those sounds, I say 'pop, pop pop'."" Jurors were also shown a screenshot of a subsequent TikTok post by Khan with the caption ""I mean what I say"" written on an image of a GB News report about the alleged threat against Farage. In the prosecution's closing speech, Mr Ratliff said the alleged threat to kill was ""not some off-the-cuff comment"" and the video was ""sinister and menacing"". He added that Khan was ""a dangerous man with an interest in firearms"". In his closing defence speech, Mr Royle said Khan was ""remonstrating in his own idiosyncratic, moronic, comedic, eye-catching, attention-seeking way"", rather than making a threat to kill. The Metropolitan Police said Khan is due to be sentenced on 14 October.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cdx216n1529o,politics,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/343f/live/f5763790-a5e3-11f0-92db-77261a15b9d2.jpg,2025-10-10T15:03:10.289000+00:00,9d9ce8869979ec4602a2b57be3169ceb54670806

The bass player and ""massive-hearted man"" joined the band in 1966 with fellow singer Justin Hayward, following the departure of Denny Laine and Clint Warwick. Birmingham-born Lodge played on songs such as Nights In White Satin, Question and Isn't Life Strange. The family said their ""darling husband"", father, grandfather, father-in-law and brother ""peacefully slipped away surrounded by his loved ones and the sounds of The Everly Brothers and Buddy Holly"". Lodge featured on some of The Moody Blues' best-known work including the psychedelic album Days Of Future Passed (1967), and its follow-up, In Search Of The Lost Chord (1968), which saw the band move towards further experimentation. He also featured on the albums On The Threshold Of A Dream, To Our Children's Children's Children, A Question Of Balance, Every Good Boy Deserves Favour and Seventh Sojourn, which saw the band move into full scale progressive rock. Lodge also featured on 1977's Octave album, which saw the group embrace a more pop-oriented sound and continued to make records with the band until their final studio album December, a collection of Christmas songs released in 2003. Chris Walter/Getty Images Band members Mike Pinder, John Lodge, Graeme Edge, Ray Thomas and Justin Hayward were pictured in 1969 The family said it was ""with the deepest sadness"" that they had to announce the musician had been ""suddenly and unexpectedly taken from us"". ""As anyone who knew this massive-hearted man knows, it was his enduring love of his wife, Kirsten, and his family, that was the most important thing to him, followed by his passion for music, and his faith."" Lodge spoke on a number of occasions about being an Evangelical Christian, saying it helped him to avoid the excesses of rock and roll. In their statement, the family said: ""We will forever miss his love, smile, kindness, and his absolute and never-ending support. ""We are heartbroken, but will walk forwards into peace surrounded by the love he had for each of us. ""As John would always say at the end of the show, thank you for keeping the faith."" Harry Herd/Getty Images Lodge was ""never happier than being on stage"", the family said Lodge was born in Erdington, Birmingham, and attended Birches Green Junior School, Central Grammar School and the Birmingham College Of Advanced Technology. He had been married to his Kirsten since September 1968, who he had two children with. The family said he was ""never happier than being on stage"" and ""adored performing with his band and son-in-law, Jon, and being able to continue sharing this music with his fans"". It gave him ""even more joy to be able to work with his daughter Emily and son Kristian"", they added. The former was referred to on The Moody Blues song Emily's Song, from the album Every Good Boy Deserves Favour. The group continued to perform live until 2018, the same year the band was inducted into the Rock And Roll Hall Of Fame.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cdr61pyzxpgo,entertainment,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/dcfb/live/f0c45700-a5dd-11f0-928c-71dbb8619e94.jpg,2025-10-10T14:43:43.181000+00:00,628c4357b8e9f4c04cc47fa312ccc8d135a9e0d7
1b34a0470af4,Swinney: No 'shortcut' to NHS wait time reduction,,"Swinney: No 'shortcut' to NHS wait time reduction Glenn Campbell Scotland Political Editor and James Delaney BBC News John Swinney says the NHS waiting lists are being tackled but there is no shortcut John Swinney has said there is no ""shortcut"" to faster diagnosis and treatment in the NHS. In an interview with BBC Scotland News, the first minister accepted that ""some people have had to wait far too long"" for certain treatment. But he insisted the Scottish government was working to expand capacity and increase operations and that ""progress is being delivered"". The NHS is still working to recover from the Covid pandemic and, as of June, about one in nine people in Scotland is on an NHS waiting list. Speaking ahead of his party's annual conference in Aberdeen, Swinney also addressed the case of an eight-year-old girl with a serious condition whose surgery has been put back by 18 months. The girl's mother has told BBC Scotland News the delay meant her daughter could not live a normal life due to her declining kidney function. The first minister said he could ""totally accept"" the worry and anxiety caused by these circumstances and offered to personally look in to the case. Swinney said the Scottish government was taking all the steps it can within its resources to ensure NHS performance matches the expectations of the public. The most recent Scottish social attitudes study covering the period up to 2023 found that 69% of those asked felt that NHS performance was getting worse. The Royal College of Emergency Medicine also claimed more than 800 deaths in Scotland last year were believed to be linked to long A&E waits. Swinney said: ""What we are doing, what we are focusing on, is about doing all we can to reduce waiting times and make sure more people are being treated and of course the most recent data shows, for example, is we've had record numbers of operations. ""We've had record numbers of hip and knee operations and these are some of the things people have had to wait quite a long time for. ""There is no shortcut. We need to make sure we get a flow of patients in to A&E, so they can get assessed quickly, so they are able to be released home. We have very high levels of patient discharge from hospital, we take all of these steps to make sure people receive care that they require."" 'Counterproductive and damaging' Swinney also said he wanted to avoid industrial action by hospital doctors who are to ballot for a strike. He said the Scottish government would ""work constructively"" with the British Medical Association (BMA) to resolve the dispute. He was also asked about immigration during the interview. Swinney said the UK debate was ""counterproductive and damaging"" and a ""positive approach"" was needed to help grow Scotland's working age population. He said we should ""embrace migration"" and that doing so was ""something we should be proud of"". Swinney said: ""I think we have to have a rational and considered debate about migration because I can't talk to a single business sector or area of activity in our country that doesn't tell me they are short of people. ""We have very low unemployment in Scotland today and our various sectors are short of people and we've got a working age population that is not large enough to support our economy and our activities. ""Scotland has always been a welcoming country, an inclusive country, that we bring people together, and that's the type of Scotland I want to live in.""",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cdr614l6ezlo,politics,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/a5d8/live/e1563820-a5f5-11f0-b741-177e3e2c2fc7.jpg,2025-10-10T16:27:00.511000+00:00,e255e5f24d745735a9ed0602866e6f3b85482863

d6cd6bc34004,MTV to axe its music TV channels in the UK,,"MTV to axe its music TV channels in the UK Mark Savage Music Correspondent Getty Images MTV Europe launched in 1987, with the UK getting a dedicated channel in 1997 MTV, the world's first 24-hour music broadcaster, is to stop showing rolling pop videos in the UK after almost 40 years when it closes five channels at the end of the year. MTV Music, MTV 80s, MTV 90s, Club MTV and MTV Live will all stop broadcasting after 31 December, the BBC understands. However, the flagship channel, MTV HD, will remain on air, showing reality series including Naked Dating UK and Geordie Shore. The move reflects a shift in viewing habits, with music videos largely consumed on YouTube and social media rather than television. A spokesman for MTV's parent company, Paramount, declined to comment. 'Breaks my heart' Former MTV VJ Simone Angel told BBC News she was ""really sad, and I'm a little bit in disbelief, and I know it's been a long time coming"". ""We need to support these artists and we all need to dance again and listen to music,"" she said. ""And I know we do that online in our own little bubbles, but MTV was the place where everything came together. So it really does break my heart."" MTV launched in the US in 1981 and the fledgling TV channel quickly captured the public imagination by showing pop videos ""on demand"", presented by enthusiastic ""VJs"" (video jockeys), who became almost as famous as the stars they introduced. Groundbreaking moments in its early years included the world premiere of Michael Jackson's Thriller video, a 16-hour broadcast of the Live Aid concerts in 1985, and the birth of the MTV Video Music Awards. A European offshoot launched in 1987 and the UK got its own dedicated channel in 1997 - launching with the video for David Baddiel and Frank Skinner's football anthem Three Lions. Getty Images Katy Perry hosted the MTV Europe Music Awards three times, in 2008, 2010 and 2013 The channel gave early breaks to presenters including Cat Deeley, Zane Lowe and Emma Willis; and later branched out into original programming with series like Ex On The Beach and Teen Mom UK. Angel, who worked for both MTV Europe and MTV UK in the 1990s, said it was a ""wild"" time. ""It was like being on a school trip without any teachers. We had so much fun,"" she said. ""MTV Europe was really the forerunner to the internet. We were the most widespread TV channel in the world at that point. We had between 100 and 150 million viewers."" 'Shouldn't just be reality TV' She recounted a story that former Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev once told the boss of MTV that the channel had an influence on young people in the Communist countries behind the Iron Curtain in the 80s. ""He said, 'Music achieved more than missiles', because MTV Europe was the first channel that showed what Western life was like. It went past all the propaganda and we showed youth culture, and people wanted that. It was incredibly important."" There is still a place for music on TV, Angel believes. ""You've just got to move with the times. To this day, it's one of the most recognisable brands in the world. Why on earth throw that away? It's not thrown away, but it's just reality TV. That's not what MTV is or should be."" Getty Images Justin Timberlake pictured at the MTV Europe Music Awards 2006 in Copenhagen In 2011, the main MTV UK channel abandoned music videos altogether, pushing all music programming to its sister stations, with the exception of the annual MTV European Music Awards. That ceremony - which was the scene of memorable moments including The Spice Girls' final appearance before splitting up in 1997, and Rita Ora's tearful tribute to Liam Payne last year - is currently on pause. Paramount put the event on ice earlier this year as it pursued a merger with entertainment company Skydance Media. The deal was approved in July , but no decision has been made about the future of the EMAs. Wider layoffs Paramount is also expected to close MTV music channels in countries including Australia, Poland, France and Brazil, according to media reports in those countries. The closures come as the company seeks to cut costs by as much as $500m (£376m) across its global portfolio. In August, it closed Paramount Television Studios, which produced series including action thriller Jack Ryan and children's adventure series The Spiderwick Chronicles. The layoffs also affected MTV productions in the UK, where original shows Gonzo and Fresh Out UK were cancelled. According to the latest ratings from Barb, MTV's music channels continued to attract modest audiences in the UK. MTV music had 1.3 million viewers in July, with MTV 90s attracting 949,000. The brand will also continue to have a presence on social media and Paramount's streaming service Paramount+.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cdr612yz8p0o,entertainment,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/f529/live/5eea1410-a5c3-11f0-add7-abf13599c13e.jpg,2025-10-10T16:06:47.758000+00:00,83ed49976bb15ee20717b49252589cbe964de872

731fe4dd6ad3,"BBC sacking presenter was 'reasonable', judge finds",,"BBC sacking presenter was 'reasonable', judge finds BBC Jack Murley, from Bodmin, worked with BBC Radio Cornwall from 2019 until 2024 The BBC's decision to dismiss one of its radio presenters has been found ""reasonable"" by a judge at an employment tribunal. Jack Murley, from Bodmin, worked at BBC Radio Cornwall from 2019 until 2024, when he was sacked by the corporation. A hearing in Exeter heard how Mr Murley was dismissed for breaching the BBC's editorial and social media guidelines. The judge, Alastair Smail, said it was ""disappointing to arrive at this position"" given Mr Murley's ability as a broadcaster. Mr Smail added that because presenters for the BBC ""have access to the airwaves"" they are in a ""privileged position"". He found that the decisions made by the disciplinary hearing manager and subsequent appeal hearing manager, who were both senior leaders and experienced reporters, were ""reasonable"". The tribunal heard how from 2022 Mr Murley openly offered his views on social media about the BBC's Local Value for All project, which involved changes to local radio stations and newsrooms, across England. He was taken off air on 30 June 2023 following a heated conversation with his manager , when they discussed his use of social media. Questions were also raised about content in Mr Murley's Loosest Goose feature, a satirical radio segment that included innuendo and was said to breach BBC guidelines. Lack of contrition Mr Murley's lawyer Nick Toms argued his client had believed he was acting within the BBC's guidelines. He added that it had been unfair that the disciplinary process had not considered Mr Murley's unblemished record of 13 years with the organisation. He said when making a decision a fair employer should take into consideration his ""previous good record"". Jesse Crozier, representing the BBC told the hearing the gross misconduct consensus has been reached because of the ""irredeemable nature of the conduct"" and a lack of ""contrition"" from Mr Murley during the disciplinary process. He said the corporation had ""lost trust"" in Mr Murley and this had made a final written warning and the continuation of his role as a presenter ""impossible"". Referring to the positive aspects of the presenter's employment record, Mr Crozier said: ""You can build up your perfect employee but they do one thing that is so grievously wrong, that it doesn't matter what is on that side of the scale, they have to go."" Judge Smail outlined how he had considered the final submissions from both sides before coming to his decision. He said Mr Murley ""adopted a policy of pleading guilty to nothing"" and believed that Mr Murley ""needed to accept those breaches"" of guidelines ""before trust could be rebuilt"". This outcome follows a previous tribunal against the BBC in November 2024 which found Mr Murley's sacking had not been discrimination for being gay or a union representative.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c9310jxe300o,entertainment,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/5597/live/75c56650-acd4-11ef-8ab9-9192db313061.jpg,2025-10-10T15:26:30.265000+00:00,6eebdd0b952f70c4645475ee0f846b6a44f4bc66

d6a0ab907d9d,Tony Blair met Jeffrey Epstein while prime minister,,"Tony Blair met Jeffrey Epstein while prime minister Jennifer McKiernan Political reporter , Joe Pike Politics investigations correspondent and Sam Francis Political reporter Getty Images Sir Tony Blair met with Jeffrey Epstein in Downing Street while still prime minister, following lobbying by Lord Peter Mandelson, the BBC has confirmed. A memo written by senior civil servant Matthew Rycroft, dated 14 May 2002, briefs Sir Tony about ""super-rich"" financial adviser Epstein ahead of a meeting scheduled at 17.00 GMT that day. The meeting was six years before Epstein pleaded guilty to soliciting prostitution from a minor in June 2008. A spokesperson for Sir Tony said: ""As far as he can remember, Mr Blair met with him for less than 30 minutes in Downing Street in 2002, and discussed US and UK politics. He never met or engaged with him subsequently."" He added: ""This was, of course, long before his crimes were known of and his subsequent conviction."" Emails seen by BBC News show Lord Mandelson pushed for the meeting, telling Sir Tony's chief of staff Jonathan Powell that Epstein was ""a friend of mine"" who ex-US President Bill Clinton hoped to introduce to the PM. The release of this and several related documents had previously been blocked by government officials due to concerns about the impact on UK-US relations. The document has now been released by the National Archives under a Freedom of Information request, following the sacking of Lord Mandelson as US ambassador after fresh revelations about his friendship with the disgraced financier. In the email to Powell - the current UK government's national security adviser - Lord Mandelson refers to Epstein as ""safe"". The email on 7 May 2002 states: ""Do you remember when Clinton saw TB [Tony Blair] he said he wanted to introduce his travelling friend, Jeffrey Epstein, to TB? ""This was frustrated - TB said at the time - in the office for reasons (he says) he was unclear about. I think TB would be interested in meeting Jeffrey, who is also a friend of mine, because Jeffrey is an active scientific catalyst/entrepreneur as well as someone who has his finger on the pulse of many worldwide markets and currencies. ""He is young and vibrant. He is safe (whatever that means) and Clinton is now doing a lot of travelling with him."" The email continues: ""I mentioned to TB that Jeffrey is in London next week and he said he would like to meet him. ""I have ascertained from Jeffrey that he is flexible - he could be here any time from Tuesday onwards to fit round the diary - but would obviously need to know reasonably quickly so as to re-schedule accordingly. Can you let me know?"" There are three separate handwritten notes on the print-out of the email, some of which are illegible, but one appears to read ""do you want to do this... Because you wanted to see Clinton by yourself... I know very little more about him"". At the time, Lord Mandelson was a backbench MP, having twice resigned from the cabinet, but still a force in Labour. Clinton has acknowledged being a former associate of Epstein but said had no knowledge of his crimes. Epstein was convicted in Florida for soliciting prostitution from a person under the age of 18 in 2008. He died in 2019 while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges. The National Archive has also released a schedule headed Trade and Industry Meetings with Industry, which includes a memo published on 14 May 2002, briefing Sir Tony about Epstein ahead of a meeting schedule for 17.00 GMT that day. The briefing, written by senior civil servant Matthew Rycroft is marked R, understood to mean restricted. In the memo, Rycroft, who until March 2025 was the permanent secretary at the Home Office, wrote to Blair: ""Jeffrey Epstein is seeing you at 5pm today. ""He is a financial adviser to the super-rich and a property developer. He is a friend of Bill Clinton and Peter Mandelson."" Rycroft states: ""The background on Epstein is that he is very rich and close to the Duke of York"". He adds: ""Peter says that Epstein now travels with Clinton and Clinton wants you to meet him. ""He thinks you would find worthwhile a conversation with him about a) science and b) international economic and monetary trends.""

David Heyman spoke briefly about how the film was progressing under its new owners while on the red carpet at the London Film Festival with 007 co-producer Amy Pascal for their latest movie Jay Kelly. ""It's going to be a lot of fun, and I think we're going to make something very special,"" Heyman told the BBC. Bond producers Barbara Broccoli and Michael G.

Barbara Broccoli and Michael G Wilson did such a remarkable job over the years."" Heyman is best known for producing all eight Harry Potter movies, as well as the three Paddington films.

""It's about sacrifices we all make,"" Clooney says. ""The character I play, he's got a lot of regret. And I don't really have quite that much regret, I've had a fairly full life. I have great friends and great family. So I feel very lucky to have pursued my career in the way that I have.""

He says he was able to draw on his past experiences to explore the role. ""Like everyone in the world you have good friends, you have people you believe in [that] you love. And my character gets to believe in my friend Clooney. ""I think he's a very funny, good, giving man. And I know him over the years, and this is the first time I ever got to sit and hang out with George for long sets of time, and we had nothing but fun."" Sandler's performance is already drawing Oscar buzz, but he says right now it is not something he is giving too much thought to. ""That's a very interesting thought. I don't know.

05cf2e4341fe,How John Swinney plans to put his stamp on the SNP as election looms,,"How John Swinney plans to put his stamp on the SNP as election looms Glenn Campbell Scotland Political Editor, Aberdeen PA Media John Swinney will make his keynote speech to the conference on Monday There is one sure sign that the Scottish National Party is about to meet for its annual conference. Around this time each year, there is always renewed emphasis on the goal of independence from the party's leadership. And right on cue, the SNP leader and First Minister John Swinney published another Scottish government paper this week promising a ""fresh start"" for Scotland should it become an independent country. It's useful for the SNP leadership to show those gathering in Aberdeen for the party's 91st annual get-together that their primary cause has not been forgotten. In truth, the party is completely stuck on how to establish a viable route to Scottish statehood. That is a source of frustration to many in the SNP and should result in a lively debate on independence strategy at conference later. PA Media Swinney launched a new paper on independence this week Whatever is decided, there is unlikely to be any movement towards independence unless the SNP retains power at Holyrood. That looked to be in serious doubt a year ago when Labour swept to power at Westminster having comprehensively defeated the SNP in a national election for the first time in 14 years. Three things have changed since then. Swinney has stabilised the SNP, Labour's popularity has slumped and the rise of Reform UK appears to have widened the SNP's pathway to what would be an incredible fifth term in office. When John Swinney took over as first minister following the resignations in quick succession of Nicola Sturgeon and Humza Yousaf he inherited a party in turmoil. He has proved to be a steadying force. He quickly calmed controversies over gender identity, the environment and the police investigation into SNP finances which has led to the prosecution of the party's former chief executive Peter Murrell. PA Media Swinney inherited a party in turmoil after the resignations of Humza Yousaf and Nicola Sturgeon If that was phase one of his leadership, phase two was to focus the Scottish government on priorities like improving public services. In short, to try to make a noticeable difference for the public. One ally of the first minister sums up this approach as ""stop digging, get delivering"". Swinney might highlight scrapping peak rail fares , signs of a reduction in child poverty and the decision to lift the two child limit on access to benefits (whether or not the UK government does the same) as examples of progress. The SNP's political opponents would point to persistent long waits on the NHS, cuts to college budgets and the emergency release of prisoners from overcrowded jails as evidence of failure. Among other challenges to be confronted by whoever is in charge, repeated warnings from financial watchdogs that levels of social spending in Scotland are unsustainable. There also appears to have been a decline in trust in the Scottish government to work in Scotland's best interests in recent years, according to the latest social attitudes survey for 2023 . All of this will feature in the pre-election arguments to come. Getty Images Labour's momentum did not last long after Sir Keir Starmer walked into Number 10 Labour insists that Scotland can take a ""new direction"" by ousting the SNP and ushering in a Labour-led government with Anas Sarwar as first minister. Labour's trouble is that their 2024 momentum did not last long after Sir Keir Starmer stepped into Number 10. The unpopularity of the prime minister and the UK government seems to have dragged Scottish Labour down. Opinion polls suggest the SNP has a double digit lead over Labour, with Reform UK nipping at their heels, having pushed the Conservatives into fourth place. The SNP appears far less popular than it was five years ago and the rise of Reform UK seems to be fragmenting support for unionist parties. That could mean the principal party of Scottish independence is still well placed to overcome divided opposition in constituencies across the country and finish as the largest party nationwide. There is nothing definitive about these polls and seven months of campaigning could produce a different outcome. Remember that against widespread expectations, Labour beat the SNP in the Hamilton, Larkhall and Stonehouse by-election earlier this year. PA Media Labour would like to see Scotland take a ""new direction"" by ousting the SNP and ushering in a Labour-led government under Anas Sarwar The Tories hope their calls for cuts in public spending, regulation and taxation will distinguish them from their left-leaning rivals and help them persuade traditional supporters not to switch to Reform UK. While Nigel Farage's party has focused on reducing immigration and more oil and gas exploitation, these are both policy areas outwith Holyrood's control. One hope for the SNP's opponents is that they can rally anti-SNP support behind whichever party appears best placed to beat them in each local area. That has had limited success in the past. As independence is more popular than the SNP at the moment, part of Swinney's strategy will be to entice at least some lapsed SNP voters back. That will mean a bit more talk of independence - a cause for which Swinney has been campaigning since he was 15. With such political experience he will sense that to many within and beyond the SNP, independence seems like something of a political mirage at the moment. The UK Supreme Court has ruled that any future referendum would need the consent of the UK government and Sir Keir Starmer has made clear he has no intention of enabling a vote during his time in power. In a key conference debate on Saturday, Swinney will argue that the ""only uncontested route"" to another referendum is for the SNP to win an overall majority of seats in the Holyrood election next May. That was what persuaded then Prime Minister David Cameron to agree to the 2014 referendum - and the first minister thinks a similar outcome would force the current PM to budge. 'Mandate to deliver independence' Then there are those who think a more radical approach is required. That the SNP should treat the 2026 election as if it were a referendum. In other words, if independence supporting parties secure more than 50% of the votes in the Holyrood list ballot that should be considered as a ""mandate to deliver independence"". It's not clear what that means. Seeking to negotiate with the UK government? Unilaterally declaring independence and daring the UK to block it? Or something else? It is an approach that would not be regarded as legitimate by parties that favour continued union. The Conservatives, Labour, the Liberal Democrats and Reform UK would reject it on the basis that elections are about so much more than the single issue of independence. This is a debate Swinney's team expect to win at conference. Their question is by how much? They will want it to be by the widest possible margin to avoid damaging his authority. One elected politician arguing the alternative case predicted a ""wee gem"" of a debate where the leadership would need to work harder than usual to get their way. Whether the SNP focus on trying to achieve a majority of votes for all independence supporting parties (including the Greens and Alba) or a majority of Holyrood seats for themselves, these are both very high bars to clear. The SNP also needs to be careful about pushing independence too hard. While it remains a popular policy with a large minority of voters it is not necessarily a priority for all those who support it. When asked to identify their key concerns in one recent survey, those asked identified the NHS, the cost of living and immigration as their top three. The Scottish government Swinney met Donald Trump in the Oval Office on his visit to the US So what else can we expect from this conference? It seems to me that Swinney has been working hard to develop an image for himself not just as a first minister but also as a potential statesman. Think meetings with Donald Trump in both Scotland and at the White House, statements at Holyrood on Ukraine and Gaza and a forthcoming visit to Africa. I imagine there will be some reference to Swinney's international engagement, not least because the newly recognised Palestinian ambassador to the UK is due to address conference. It's worth remembering that Swinney took over as first minister midway through a parliamentary term secured on a manifesto signed off by Nicola Sturgeon. Yes, they were close. He was her deputy in government. But this conference, particularly his keynote speech on Monday, is an opportunity for Swinney to put his own stamp on things. Expect him to set out more clearly who he is and what a Swinney government less bound by previous pledges would seek to do. There will obviously be continuity but perhaps some elements of change too. Will that be worthy description as a third phase of his leadership?

7791bb4965da,"Murder, betrayal and lies - why The Traitors appeals to our dark side",,"Murder, betrayal and lies - why The Traitors appeals to our dark side Paul Glynn Culture reporter BBC The celebrities were shocked to discover Paloma Faith had been murdered - but for some it was all an act Spoiler warning: This article reveals details from The Celebrity Traitors The Traitors, at its heart, is a game of lying and deception. The celebrity edition of the hit BBC show began this week, and with it a murdering spree. For the first, it was Alan Carr in the kitchen with the poisoned lily. Just as in the regular series, we find a bunch of people attempting to find out who is lying and who is telling the truth, while faced with the enormous uncertainty of being ""killed"" off. On this occasion, the victim was singer Paloma Faith. She was unimpressed to be bumped off by Carr, who is her friend - or so she thought. So why have so many viewers taken the show to their hearts, and what does it say about our human nature? For Richard Wiseman, professor of the public understanding of psychology at the University of Hertfordshire, such treachery ""feels a bit like everyday life"". ""You're trying to figure out which of your friends and partners and colleagues may not be entirely straight with you,"" he tells BBC News. Deception, he says, ""is in our DNA"" as something we do from around the age of three. ""As soon as children master language, they start lying,"" adds Prof Wiseman. ""If we were radically honest with one another all the time, then we'd probably break apart as a society fairly rapidly. So on one level, deception holds us together."" The problem, he adds, is that it can also be used in an ""exploitative way"", as anyone who tuned in this week to find current Celebrity Traitors Alan Carr, Cat Burns and Jonathan Ross scheming so splendlidly will testify. ""It absolutely fascinates us... you've got that microcosm, you can see all of that being played out in a rather fun way."" The hardest thing with lie detecting is knowing how people behave normally, according to Prof Wiseman, who has written about the psychology of magic and illusion, deception, luck and self-development. ""What we're quite good at is, when it's friends and partners, we know their truthful behaviour,"" he says. ""And you're looking for people departing from that."" For example, when TV presenter Kate Garraway stood accused of being a potential traitor for her excessively theatrical reactions, she defended herself by explaining she was always ""a ham"". ""Now, you have to know her to know how she behaves normally to know whether this is deceptive or not."" Prof Wiseman thinks the faithful stars are going wrong by so far basing their assumptions on what people do and say, when ""the best signals are what people don't say and don't do"". ""Liars tend to be pretty quiet,"" he says, noting the difficulties of that with ""a bunch of celebrities"" who will be ""used to being centre of attention"". Singer Burns, one of the traitors, told viewers she planned to ""lay low"" and go ""under the radar"", and it seems to be working so far. Good liars also tend to be intelligent, Wiseman says, citing salespeople, politicians and - ahem - performers among those who will be ""pretty high self-monitors"". ""Alan Carr and Jonathan Ross are very used to interviewing people,"" he says. ""And used to interviewees who will be somewhat elusive."" Host Claudia Winkleman oversaw the celebrities as they dug their own graves in episode one So do actors and performers like those on this show make better liars than previous contestants? Not according to one of the current faithful, actor and presenter Stephen Fry, who told the Radio Times : ""Actors are terrible liars! It's not an actor's job to lie. It's an actor's job to tell the truth."" But was he telling the truth or lying? Jake Brown, joint winner from series three, told BBC Breakfast he thinks professional performers ""know how to deceive, they know how to be someone else"". Series three finalist Alexander Dragonetti tells BBC News that anyone hoping to rely on their acting skills to win will have to be ""incredibly consistent"" and do it ""perfectly day after day"". ""If anyone sees even a small chink in your armour, they'll think you're playing a game and they'll get rid of you,"" he says. ""So if you do act, this is going to be the test of your life. You're going to have to do it perfectly day after day. ""And the days are long, the pressure is huge, and holding up that kind of act for any period I think is going to be incredibly hard."" 'The illusion of co-operation' On the latest episode, beloved veteran actress Celia Imrie was seen telling her fellow participants: ""People think I'm nice, but I'm not."" For psychologist Susan Young, the celebrity edition of the show adds an extra level of deception and intrigue due to the professional ""impression management"" of pre-existing personas. Viewers ""project pre-existing beliefs"" on to the stars because ""these are people who we feel we know"", she tells us. But in reality we ""can't tell where the performance ends and where it begins"". As ""voyeurs of morality"", she adds, ""we can't wait for the nice person to do something unexpectedly"". The group dynamic is what interests Young most because what lies beneath is an inherent ""double bind"". ""Everyone must lie"", she says, because ""to be honest is dangerous""; and yet ""lying corrodes the team"", which is much-needed to complete tasks. ""What the show does here, it exposes the illusion of co-operation and that's in so many systems. It's in our workplaces, it's in politics, it's in friendships under stress,"" she says. ""At the end of the day, given certain circumstances and under certain pressures, altruism will thin and self-interest surfaces."" She adds: ""It's almost like a social experiment, it's mirroring how quickly loyalty will collapse when incentives change."" Caroline Frost, TV editor of the Radio Times, reckons The Celebrity Traitors is on course to be ""one of the biggest shows of the year"". Two years ago, she recalls, she attended an industry seminar where producers said they had resisted the urge to include celebrities in the original show because they thought it was more interesting to select people who did not have public reputations to keep intact. But that was then, and this is now. The great paradox of a new celebrity version, she smiles, is that none of their careers and reputations ""count for anything come nightfall"". ""The further they get into the game, the more of the celebrity trappings get left behind and the less important their fame becomes, which means it really doesn't matter that they're celebrities at all."" Frost thinks it was an ""incredibly ingenious decision"" to make Carr a traitor ""because he's giggly and extrovert and doesn't seem to be able to ever filter what he says or keep a secret"". ""Making him a traitor has really upped the stakes."" She feels Carr's repuatation as a bubbly, chatty man has been ""weaponised"" to enable him to get away with murdering his mate in plain sight. He did seem a bit cut up about it afterwards, mind you, when he met up again with his fellow traitors. But as Ross reminded him: ""You're not a bad person. You're a good traitor.""

29b9dc5b6b21,Wolf Alice: 'A good album is one of the highest forms of art',,"Wolf Alice: 'A good album is one of the highest forms of art' Mark Savage Music Correspondent BBC Wolf Alice at the BBC in August 2025 (left-right): Joff Oddie, Theo Ellis, Joel Amey and Ellie Rowsell Wolf Alice are in a class of their own when it comes to the Mercury Prize. Last month, they received their fourth consecutive nomination for the coveted music award thanks to their new album, The Clearing. That's something no-one else has ever achieved. Not Arctic Monkeys, not Radiohead, not Pulp. What's more, they've done it with their first four albums. ""For some reason, it makes me feel really anxious,"" admits singer Ellie Rowsell, speaking to the BBC from Nashville, where the band are in final rehearsals for their world tour. She's speaking from experience. When Wolf Alice won the Mercury Prize for their second album, Visions of a Life, in 2018, Ellie struggled to gain her composure at the podium. ""I'm so nervous,"" she exclaimed, her hands shaking, before bandmate Theo Ellis stepped in to finish the speech. To fans, Rowsell's jitters might have seemed strange. On stage, the singer is normally a fireball of intensity, screaming punky anthems like Yuk Foo and commanding the spotlight with magnetic charisma. But their more intimate songs portray her as an habitual outsider who doubts her own abilities and motivations. On Thorns, the pensive opening song of The Clearing, she even berates herself for ""making a song and dance"" about the break-up that inspired Wolf Alice's previous album, Blue Weekend. ""I don't know if I'm shy. I think I'm socially inept,"" she recently told Canadian DJ Tara Sloane . ""I'm very confident in some things, but I'm not the loudest person in the room."" The band won the Mercury Prize in 2018, beating other shortlisted artists including Arctic Monkeys, Noel Gallagher and Lily Allen Her nerves about attending another awards show is understandable, then. But Rowsell is also ""grateful and happy"" to be included on the Mercury shortlist again. They will find out if they have won when the ceremony takes place on Thursday. ""We take albums pretty seriously,"" says guitarist Joff Oddie, speaking from his home in London (he's sitting out the US tour because his wife's about to give birth to their first child). ""In our world, a good album is one of the highest forms of art. People can do good songs, or a great live performance, and those are all great signposts. But, for me, a really great album is an incredible feat... if you can pull it off."" That's why the band have signed up as ambassadors for National Album Day, which takes place on Saturday, 18 October, with special events around the UK and limited edition vinyl re-releases of classic records by Liam Gallagher, Patti Smith and Iggy Pop. Asked to name their favourite albums, however, and Wolf Alice are evasive. ""I don't know what my absolute top three would be,"" says Rowsell. ""But if I can re-listen to an album top to bottom over and over again, that's a telltale sign - because it's hard to keep your attention."" PA Media The band's third album, 2021's Blue Weekend, saw them rise to festival headliner status The singer - who reveals Pink's Missundaztood was the first album she owned - eventually settles on The Streets' A Grand Don't Come For Free as an example of ""a perfect album"". ""I feel like it's one of those albums where, even if it's not to your taste, you can actually appreciate the artistry,"" she says. ""I'm not really that into concept albums, but it's got an amazing story from beginning to end - and it never compromises the songs,"" agrees Oddie. The guitarist also chooses Brian Eno's ambient classic Music For Airports as one of his Desert Island Albums. ""I've spent most of my adult life in transit, and it's a beautiful record for zoning out the outside world,"" he says. Shape shifters They collectively agree that 1966's The Velvet Underground & Nico is a must-have for any serious music fan. ""It's one of the most important alternative records of all time,"" says Oddie. ""It's got incredible songwriting, the songs stand up on their own, but they're cloaked in really avant-garde sounds and techniques. ""As a guitarist in an indie band, if you can write incredible songs and play them interestingly, then you're part of that lineage."" The variety of their tastes - Rowsell also selects the mutant folk of Lankum's 2023 album False Lankum - is the key to Wolf Alice's shape-shifting sound. Getty Images After forming as folk duo in 2010, Wolf Alice became one of the UK's biggest indie bands They started out as a folk duo in 2010 but quickly expanded to a quartet, adopting an alt-rock style characterised by Oddie's textured guitar work, the rhythmic interplay between bassist Ellis and drummer Joel Amey, and Rowsell's cutting lyricism. In the early stages, Oddie says, they were ""just muddling through"". ""We had no idea, from a technical perspective, of what we were doing. ""We worked with some brilliant people that were, in hindsight, very, very patient with us. ""It was probably a nightmare to make a record [with us] at that time because we had an idea of what we wanted to sound like, but we didn't know how things worked."" Each album marked a progression. Their 2015 debut My Love Is Cool wrapped ethereal indie anthems in barbed-wire guitar riffs; 2017's Visions Of A Life produced their biggest hit, the delirious synth-driven Don't Delete The Kisses , as well as winning the Mercury; and 2021's Blue Weekend added a sweeping, bruised grandeur to their sound. The Clearing, which topped the UK album chart in August, marks their boldest evolution yet - embracing the nostalgic sounds of 1970s FM pop radio, earning comparisons to The Carpenters, Fleetwood Mac and Steely Dan. Rachel Fleminger Hudson / RCA Records Wolf Alice are embracing the iconography of 1970s rock bands on their new album ""Maybe in hindsight it was a bit of a stylistic turn,"" says Rowsell. ""But it didn't feel too drastic at the time. It just reflected what we were listening to."" Their goal was to make a record that felt good to play live, full of what Oddie calls ""more song-y songs"" like the Blue Weekend track Delicious Things – which has become an unexpected highlight of their live shows. ""That song was a departure from what we'd done before [and] it didn't feel like it was one people would enjoy live,"" says Rowsell. ""But the audience were just as upbeat and excited as when we play one of our rock songs. ""So I was like, 'OK, it's not just fast, loud, heavy music that gets a crowd going'. And that was really exciting."" ""It's a confidence thing,"" adds Oddie. ""Sometimes you feel like you have to make yourself heard by being as loud and abrasive as you can be. ""We were going, 'Oh, we can connect with the audience in a way that's just as impactful, but different'."" The band are currently in the middle of a world tour that hits the UK in November Recorded in Los Angeles with A-list producer Greg Kurstin (Adele, Beyoncé, Foo Fighters), the album is unapologetically big; brimming with harmonies and hooks and ambition and heart. But the soft rock reinvention caught some critics off guard. While reviews were largely positive, The Quietus recoiled at the lack of heavy guitar anthems in a scathing screed that employed descriptors like ""unintrusive"", ""clunking"" and ""by-numbers detritus"". ""Wolf Alice had the juice. On The Clearing, that juice has abandoned them,"" agreed Soundsphere's Callie Petch . Admittedly, it takes a minute to adjust - but The Clearing is one of those records that reveals new depths and complexity with every listen. The songs might not have the tinnitus-inducing qualities of old favourites like Fluffy or Play The Greatest Hits, but there's a newfound confidence and playfulness amid the calm. That's why, on the album's artwork, Wolf Alice lean into the iconography of 70s rock. Ellis poses in a leather jacket studded with the words Wolf Alice. Rowsell stands in a spotlight, head thrust back as she sings with eyes-screwed-shut intensity. RCA Records The artwork marks the first time the band have taken full portraits for one of their album covers ""On our first two albums, the artwork was just found images,"" says Rowsell. ""And if you can stumble across a photo that represents the music and the lyrics, it's really romantic and amazing."" For this record, however, Wolf Alice called in photographer Rachel Fleminger Hudson – who spent six months trawling through ""thousands and thousands"" of archive images and interviews to create an aesthetic that reflected the band's inspirations and ambitions. ""She was very academic in how she approached it,"" says Oddie. ""There was a lot of leather. A lot."" It all adds up to a declaration of intent. A criticism/compliment that's often been levelled at Wolf Alice is that they're impossible to pin down. Their influences are too broad. Their ideas are too disparate. But The Clearing has a clarity and purpose that suggests they're finally OK with the idea of being a chart-topping, festival-headlining ""big band"". ""Oh, I don't know if we're owning being a big band,"" Oddie demurs. ""I don't think we'd say that. But we are owning being a band, full stop. ""We're leaning into the lore.""",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/crmey4pw9vpo,entertainment,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/64d5/live/1dc95f80-a42f-11f0-92db-77261a15b9d2.png,2025-10-11T02:34:52.195000+00:00,738fcba0c58c5d127a7d4832fb49c03eaa1147e1

""She came to a party here a few years ago where, I hope, she uttered her immortal line, 'I'm going to get so absolutely plastered tonight, darling.

Queen Camilla then hosted a reception in the French Dining Room, with attendees including Sir Salman Rushdie and Sir Ian Rankin. Earlier in the week, Queen Camilla led the tributes to Dame Jilly, who died after a fall. In a statement, she said she hoped her hereafter would be filled ""with impossibly handsome men and devoted dogs"". Since Dame Jilly's death, there has been an outpouring of love for her.

Keaton, who was born in Los Angeles, shot to fame in the 1970s through her role as Kay Adams-Corleone in The Godfather films. She was also known for starring in Father of the Bride, First Wives Club and Annie Hall, which won her the Academy Award for Best Actress in 1978. The actress, whose Hollywood career spanned more than 50 years, died in California, her family confirmed to People magazine. A source also confirmed her death to the New York Times. Paying tribute, her First Wives Club co-star Bette Midler wrote on Instagram: ""The brilliant, beautiful, extraordinary Diane Keaton has died. I cannot tell you how unbearably sad this makes me. ""She was hilarious, a complete original, and completely without guile, or any of the competitiveness one would have expected from such a star. What you saw was who she was ... oh, la, lala!"" Actor Ben Stiller paid tribute on X, writing: ""Diane Keaton. One of the greatest film actors ever. An icon of style, humor and comedy. Brilliant. What a person.""

5711ee3f748d,KPop Demon Hunters directors on Oscar chances and a possible sequel,,"KPop Demon Hunters directors on Oscar chances and a possible sequel Colin Paterson Entertainment correspondent Netflix Zoey, Rumi and Mira are Huntr/x - the Kpop trio who also try and save the world from evil Maggie Kang, the creator and co-director of Kpop Demon Hunters, has said she is ""excited for the potential for more stories"" involving animated girl group Huntr/x. Speaking to the BBC during a visit to Europe, Kang explained that while there was ""nothing official we can talk about"", she and co-director Chris Appelhans believe ""there's definitely more we can do with these characters in this world"". ""And whatever it will be, it will be a story that deserves to be a sequel, and it will be something that we want to see,"" she added. Kpop Demon Hunters has become a cultural phenomenon this year, overtaking Squid Game as the most watched title in Netflix history, with more than 325m views. Getty The directors of Kpop Demon Hunters, Chris Appelhans and Maggie Kang The animated film tells the story of a hugely successful female Kpop trio, who play enormous concerts at the same time as trying to save the world from evil forces. They end up locked in battle against a boy band called Saja Boys, who are made up of demons. The film has broken record after record. A sing-a-long version released in cinemas in August became the first ever Netflix film to top the US box office. Its music also topped the US singles and albums charts, becoming the first soundtrack in history to have four songs simultaneously in the US top 10, something not even Saturday Night Fever could achieve. The film's anthem Golden, sung by Huntr/x, has spent eight weeks at number one, tying Sugar Sugar by The Archies for the most time at the top of the charts by an animated act. Could the Oscars go Golden? There is now a real belief that Kpop Demon Hunters could be set to slay the Oscars. Critics have loved the film, which holds a score of 95% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes , the online review aggregator. The influential Gold Derby predictions website now has it as the favourite for the best animated film , ahead of Zootopia 2 and Elio. ""The title alone is obviously Oscar bait,"" laughs Chris Appelhans, the American who is the other half of the directing duo. ""We tried to do something new and it was really hard and I think we're really proud of how it came out. But if people are going to reward that, that would be awesome."" The other category where the film should be a strong challenger is best original song, where the rules state that any film can only enter three numbers. Netflix Songs by both Hunter/x and the Saja Boys, the boyband populated by demons, could be nominated at the Oscars Netflix have already stated that breakout hit Golden will be included for Academy consideration, but what about the other two slots? ""I think Your Idol is such a banger,""  says Kang about song the Saja Boys sing while feeding the souls of their audience to the evil overlord Gwi-Ma. ""We're so proud of the song, but also the sequence. We cheered, we were so proud of it."" Appelhans, however, is team Huntr/x, opting for What it Sounds Like. ""The finale was such a technical challenge, both in songwriting and storytelling,"" he explains. ""To make a song that was the climax of your movie, with a lot of moving parts, but was also an actual cathartic song."" Kang concurs: ""It's the one song that every time I hear it, I just cry. It's very emotional."" ""No room for Soda Pop?"" I question about the Saja Boys earworm. ""Maybe we could get four?"" laughs Kang. ""We'll just submit then all,"" joins in Appelhans. Summer of success Appelhans can pin point the exact moment back in June when he realised they had a hit on their hands. ""It's literally 2am the night after the film came out. I'm on TikTok and in the comments section they are perfectly articulating Rumi's emotional journey."" He was overjoyed that the fans were already engaging with film's main protagonist, on a deep level. Kang, who was born in South Korea and moved to Canada aged five, places the breakthrough moment as slightly later. ""We were able to connect with our core audience, which is the KPop audience and the animation fans and that demographic took to our film very quickly. ""But it was the third week when the trajectory of the graph of viewership really changed. We were like, 'Woah. That was weird.' ""And we could see through our social media all the different pockets of demographic that were connecting to it."" Kang believes that the fans have been crucial in film's all conquering rise: ""They are an age group that loves to make content. And it was kind of like free advertising. They were just spreading the word of this movie everywhere. I think that helped it develop these long legs."" The film's success continues to grow. Four months after its release, it was still the most watched film in 19 countries last week, including the UK and US. The Kpop stars Rei Ami, Audrey Nuna, and EJAY, who provide the singing voices for Huntr/x, have appeared on both Saturday Night Live (in a skit with Bad Bunny) and gave their first ever live performance of Golden on Jimmy Fallon's US chat show . ""We were so bummed that we weren't able to be there at Fallon,"" says Kang in a rare moment of non-total positivity. ""We were asleep in Paris. Just to see him speaking to our girls was so weird. It now feels more real than ever. I'm just so proud of them. Todd Owyoung/NBC via Getty Images (L-R) Rei Ami, Audrey Nuna, and EJAY, who provide the singing voices of Huntr/x, were presented with a platinum disc by Fallon One thing the pair would like to clear up is that they do not believe that their film should be classified as anime. ""I don't think we are big enough anime fans to be that inspired from it,"" explains Kang. ""The anime we like are very old school, like Cowboy Bebop and Sailor Moon,"" referencing two Japanese TV shows which originated in the 90s. Appelhans agrees: ""I think it was a flavour. I think we were influenced by a lot of Korean film makers and k-dramas. It was part of a wide spectrum of tones that we wanted to hit, but not the dominant one."" No live action adaptation They are also quick to rule out rumours of a Kpop Demon Hunters live-action adaptation. Kang wants to kick that idea into the underworld: ""There's so many elements of the tone and the comedy that are so suited for animation,"" she says. ""It's really hard to imagine these characters in a live action world. It would feel too grounded. So totally it wouldn't work for me."" For Appelhans, it is an ill-conceived idea: ""One of the great things about animation is that you make these composites of impossibly great attributes. Rumi can be this goofy comedian and then singing and doing a spinning back-kick a second later and then freefalling through the sky. ""The joy of animation is how far you can push and elevate what's possible. I remember they adapted a lot of different animes and often times, it just feels a little stilted."" Ricky Midlesworth/ Netflix The speaking voices of Huntr/x: Ji-young Yoo (Zoey), Arden Cho (Rumi) and May Hong (Rumi) No matter what happens this awards season, Kang says their expectations for the film have already been more than surpassed. She surmises that the aim was ""to connect people and bring them to Kpop"". ""Just seeing people bond over this movie has been so wonderful,"" she reflects. ""So all the awards would be great, but I think we feel really incredible about what the movie has done already. So it feels like we've kind of won in a way.""",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c8rvzmyyzmpo,entertainment,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/5227/live/940c9bf0-a5ea-11f0-928c-71dbb8619e94.jpg,2025-10-11T23:04:33.226000+00:00,d6d3596d829dd145be3d399578b4390988e81ae2
e0adc8957ee3,Phillipson: Universities must tackle antisemitism,,"Universities must act to protect Jewish students from harassment and discrimination on campuses, Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson has said, as she set out measures to tackle antisemitism. Phillipson said there had been an ""unacceptable increase in antisemitism"" at universities and added that many Jewish students currently do not feel safe on campuses. She said the UK government was funding training to help staff and students at universities ""tackle this poison of antisemitism"". ""There can be no place for harassment and intimidation,"" Phillipson told BBC One's Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg programme. ""Universities can and must act on that."" Speaking on the programme, Conservative shadow foreign secretary Priti Patel said the Labour government should be ""gripping"" antisemitism in the UK, including what she branded ""hate marches where people are being so racist to the Jewish community"". She argued ""hatred"" was demonstrated on the streets of London on Saturday, when thousands of protesters gathered for a rally in support of Palestinians. There have also been regular protests staged at universities over the conflict in Gaza, including on the second anniversary of the 7 October Hamas attack on Israel earlier this week. The protests went ahead despite the pleas of Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer, who urged students not to take part, warning of ""rising antisemitism on our streets"". The demonstrations came days after two Jewish men were killed in a terrorist attack at a Manchester synagogue on Yom Kippur. A report by CST last year found a 117% increase in antisemitic incidents on university campuses in the 2022/23 and 2023/2024 academic years, when compared with the preceding two years. Phillipson said she had spoken to Jewish students who felt they needed to conceal their identity. ""On campus, Jewish students don't feel safe,"" she said. ""And often, parents worry about sending their children to university. We cannot accept that. There can be no place for it."" The education secretary said she had written to university vice-chancellors urging them to take steps to protect Jewish students from harassment. The government said the Union of Jewish Students will deliver 600 training sessions to help university staff support students, identify harassment and hate. A £4m fund will support projects that teach pupils and students how to identify misinformation online and promote interfaith understanding. Separately, £2m is being put towards a scheme to teach secondary school pupils in England about the Holocaust - the genocide of Jews during World War Two. Patel said the Conservatives stood by the right to protest and freedom of expression. But Patel told Laura Kuenssberg that pro-Palestinian marches taking place in London were ""ugly protests"" which demonstrated ""division and hatred"" in our society. ""Look at what happened on the streets of London yesterday. Look at the level of hatred that was demonstrated on the streets of London to Britain's Jewish community,"" she said. Tens of thousands of pro-Palestinian protesters gathered in central London on Saturday, as well as a small group of pro-Israeli counter-protesters. During the march, which came a day after a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas came into effect in Gaza, slogans such as ""stop arming Israel"" and ""free Palestine"" could be seen. The Metropolitan Police said it had made 14 arrests for offences including breaching Public Order Act conditions, affray and supporting a proscribed group.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cly9y7gg6eqo,politics,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/ba27/live/16d92240-a74b-11f0-8dcd-87d5a4ff00af.jpg,2025-10-12T10:15:56.723000+00:00,4498b422018ada4d031d70bd75d70c653b342314
b1f592f9c00a,"Starmer to attend Egypt summit on Gaza peace plan, No 10 says",,"Starmer to attend Egypt summit on Gaza peace plan, No 10 says PA Media The prime minister will attend an international peace summit in Egypt on Monday where the peace plan for Gaza will be signed, Downing Street has said. Sir Keir Starmer will pay ""particular tribute"" in Sharm El-Sheikh to US President Donald Trump, No 10 added. A ceasefire in Gaza took effect on Friday morning after Israel and Hamas agreed to the first phase of a ceasefire agreement and hostage return deal brokered by Trump, with the next phases still to be negotiated. The US president will lead the summit alongside Egypt's President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi with leaders from more than 20 countries in attendance, a spokesman for al-Sisi said. Under the deal, Hamas has until 12:00 (09:00 GMT) on Monday to release all Israeli hostages - including 20 who are believed to be alive, and the remains of up to 28 deceased hostages. Israel should also release around 250 Palestinian prisoners and 1,700 detainees from Gaza, while increased amounts of aid should enter the Strip. Many details for the later phases, which would be negotiated after the successful completion of phase one, could be hard to reach agreement on - such as the governance of Gaza, the extent of Israeli troop withdrawal, and the disarming of Hamas. Downing Street said Monday's summit would involve a ""signing ceremony"" for the peace plan, ""marking a historic turning point for the region after two years of conflict and bloodshed"". Sir Keir will thank Egypt, Qatar and Turkey for ""bringing us to this point"" as well as Trump, before calling for continued coordination to secure ""swift progress towards phase two"" of the truce. No 10 added in its statement: ""He will offer the UK's steadfast support and engagement with international partners as we look to secure the ceasefire, get urgently needed humanitarian assistance into Gaza and secure a basis for a lasting peace and security."" French President Emmanuel Macron will also attend, the Elysee Palace confirmed on Saturday, where he will ""express his full support for the implementation of the agreement"". Confirming the summit late on Saturday, a spokesperson for Egypt's presidency said it was intended to ""end the war in the Gaza Strip, strengthen peace and stability efforts in the Middle East, and open a new page in regional security and stability"". Trump had told reporters at the White House on Friday that he would be travelling to the region on Monday, addressing Israel's parliament the Knesset, before heading to Egypt. He said: ""We have a lot of leaders from all over the world coming too, they've been invited."" Egypt's foreign ministry had also said US Secretary of State Marco Rubio discussed arrangements for the summit with Foreign Minister Badr Abdelatty. The ceasefire came into effect after the Israeli government approved the first phase of Trump's ceasefire and hostage return deal on Thursday, following three days of indirect talks in Egypt. The Israeli military said it had partially withdrawn troops from parts of Gaza and pulled back to an agreed position within the territory - though troops still occupy half of the Strip. Speaking on BBC One's Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg programme, Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson said the ceasefire marked "" a massive step forward"". When asked whether the UK had a role in the peace plan, she added: ""We do have a role, but of course the role of the US has been critical in this - we can all recognise that."" Shadow foreign secretary Dame Priti Patel said the prime minister's visit to Egypt for the Sharm El-Sheikh summit would be a ""photo opportunity"" and the government has ""had no role whatsoever"" in the Gaza ceasefire. ""I think it's extraordinary that Keir Starmer is apparently going to Egypt tomorrow when we've got plenty of domestic issues that he should be resolving,"" she told Kuenssberg. The UK has already said it has ""no plans"" to send British troops to be part of a multinational force that will monitor the latest ceasefire from Israel. The US is moving up to 200 troops already based in the region to what it is calling a civil-military coordination centre in Israel, officials have said, alongside forces from Arab and Muslim countries including Egypt, Qatar, and Turkey. Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper said on Friday the UK would continue to support the peace process in other ways, including looking at getting private finance into Gaza. Israel's war on Gaza was triggered by the Hamas-led attacks on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 taken hostage. Since then, more than 67,000 Palestinians have been killed, including more than 18,000 children, the Hamas-run health ministry says. A previous ceasefire agreement that began in January collapsed after two months when Israel resumed its military offensive, having never got past the first stage of a three-stage plan.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c9qnqx7znqno,politics,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/c65e/live/eaa51700-a6d8-11f0-826a-6be1fb467f36.jpg,2025-10-12T10:10:40.193000+00:00,98324b30a08599fec789ef754e01be84b2b05886
8685f7036fb9,"Plaid promises independence plan, but not in first term",,"Plaid promises independence plan, but not in first term David Deans Political reporter, BBC Wales News Matthew Horwood Rhun ap Iorwerth has been leader of Plaid since 2023 Plaid Cymru has promised to publish a plan for Welsh independence - but not within the first term of a Plaid-led government. At the party conference members endorsed leader Rhun ap Iorwerth's proposal to set up a ""standing commission"" to talk to the public about the future of the country. Members supported plans for the commission to prepare a white paper on Welsh independence, but ap Iorwerth told members that was not ""for the next government"". He did not give a date for when, but it suggests Plaid Cymru could pursue the idea if it won both the 2026 and 2030 Senedd elections. Ap Iorwerth used the conference in Swansea to present his party as a government in waiting, saying it was ready to replace Welsh Labour at the next vote in May. The party has already pulled back from its previous commitment to offer an independence referendum within five years, made at the last election in 2021 under former leader Adam Price. Ap Iorwerth ruled out a referendum in the first term of a Plaid-led government back in May . However, in Friday's conference speech he said the party would ""kick start the national debate on independence"". Plaid's annual conference on Saturday endorsed a motion that said Wales was ""on a journey to independence, and that enhancing devolution could form part of that journey"". It said a previous Welsh government-backed independent commission on Wales' future was a ""model for engaging people"" on constitutional issues, with the party's motion saying a standing commission should be set up to oversee the government commission's recommendations. Among other things, the government commission called for justice and policing powers to be given to the Welsh government, and for the full devolution of rail services – both decisions the UK government would need to take. Independence was a viable option for Wales' future, the commission had said, although it did not explicitly support it or any other option, with a caveat that independence meant ""hard choices in the short to medium term"". 'Formal path' The conference motion said the standing commission would engage ""citizens in an ongoing dialogue about constitutional issues"" and research ""issues of relevance to Wales' constitutional future"". It would also prepare a ""white paper on Welsh independence"". The motion also said that the power to hold a referendum should be devolved. A white paper is a document that details a government's plans or proposals. The SNP published a white paper on its independence plans ahead of the 2014 Scottish referendum, in its second term of government. BBC Wales was told the standing commission could begin gathering evidence for a white paper in a Plaid first term. Proposing the motion to the conference on Saturday, Ap Iorwerth said: ""The motion looks to the future... and the need ultimately for a white paper which would set the formal path towards asking the people of Wales in a referendum. ""We make it clear it is us that should call the referendum when the time is right. ""But that's not for now or the next government. ""Our work now is to take the discussion forward on the next steps for Wales's constitutional journey.""",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c8646jdq323o,politics,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/cef8/live/24a815e0-a6cc-11f0-bf22-9df87c17cee5.jpg,2025-10-12T07:26:53.513000+00:00,86f01679bcc22f0a798df600891eb0d684629e70

The Conservatives have suggested Jonathan Powell, the prime minister's national security adviser, had a role in not giving prosecutors evidence they said they needed to secure convictions. Charges against Christopher Cash and Christopher Berry – who both deny the allegations – were dropped last month, prompting criticism from ministers and MPs. Asked about Mr Powell's involvement, Bridget Phillipson told the BBC: ""I can give you that reassurance, he did not have those conversations around the substance or the evidence of the case."" Phillipson said ministers were ""deeply disappointed that the case hasn't proceeded"" and insisted the Crown Prosecution Service was ""best placed to explain why it was not able to bring forward a prosecution"". Downing Street had previously denied that ministers were involved in the collapse of the case. But in a rare intervention this week, the director of public prosecutions Stephen Parkinson, the head of the CPS, said the trial collapsed because the government did not provide evidence referring to China as a national security threat. The Conservatives have submitted an urgent question in Parliament, asking ministers to address MPs on Monday to explain why the trial collapsed. They have suggested Mr Powell, who has sought closer relations with Beijing, failed to give the CPS the evidence required. Shadow home secretary Chris Philp told the BBC ministers ""must urgently explain why it chose not to disclose the reams of information it has demonstrating China was a threat to national security in the 2021-2023 period"". He said: ""It looks as if Jonathan Powell was behind this decision – and he should resign if he is."" The prime minister has said the government could only draw on the previous Conservative's position, which designated China an ""epoch-defining challenge"". ""You have to prosecute people on the basis of the circumstances at the time of the alleged offence,"" the prime minister told reporters in India this week. ""So all the focus needs to be on the policy of the Tory government in place then."" Jonathan Powell, one of Sir Keir's most senior advisers and political allies, visited China earlier this year Several former Conservative ministers and advisers have told the BBC there was no official designation of whether a country amounts to a threat. They claim there is a document with ""hundreds"" of examples of Chinese activity posing a threat to the UK at the time of the alleged offences, which could have been given as evidence. Sources cited the hack on the Ministry of Defence, which ministers suspected China was behind, as one of many incidents. ""I don't think there is a sane jury in the world that would look at that evidence and conclude China was not a threat,"" a source in the last government said. Former Conservative ministers also point to public statements, including from the former head of MI5 Ken McCallum, who in 2023 said there had been a ""sustained campaign"" of Chinese espionage on a ""pretty epic scale"". The Liberal Democrats said the government's approach to China was ""putting our national security at risk"". The party urged the government to block the planning application for a new Chinese embassy in London. ""Giving the green light to the super embassy being built in the heart of the City of London and above critical data connections would enable Chinese espionage on an industrial scale,"" Liberal Democrat foreign affairs spokesman Calum Miller said. Mr Cash, a former parliamentary researcher, and Mr Berry, were charged under the Official Secrets Act in April 2024, when the Conservatives were in power. They were accused of gathering and providing information prejudicial to the safety and interests of the state between December 2021 and February 2023. Under the Official Secrets Act, anyone accused of spying can only be prosecuted if the information they passed on was useful to an enemy. However, last month the director of public prosecutions said ""the case could no longer proceed to trial since the evidence no longer met the evidential test"".",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cg424d712q7o,politics,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/99b2/live/668aeee0-a3b3-11f0-9871-a159926144cf.jpg,2025-10-12T12:40:51.452000+00:00,604d556e998b34e0459c7456e6d9983d275bfad7

Hillingdon Council said 152 Chagossians had arrived at Heathrow Airport in the borough this week so far, bringing the total to over 600 since last July. The Tory-run council says it expects to spend £2m this year on its legal duty to help homeless British-Chagossians, putting pressure on stretched housing resources and ""breaking"" its finances. Many of the Chagossians are coming from Mauritius because they say they feel unsafe there after the UK government agreed a deal to hand over the Chagos Islands to the country. The UK government said Chagossians were expected to make their own housing arrangements prior to travelling and argued the influx of arrivals was ""completely unrelated"" to the Chagos Islands deal with Mauritius. The Chagos Islands in the Indian Ocean, then an overseas territory of the UK, was transformed into a military base in the 1960s and the entire population was forced to move out, mainly to Mauritius or the Seychelles. But in 2002, a limited number of Chagossians were granted the right to full British citizenship. Several thousand now live in the UK, incuding an expat population of 3,000 in Crawley, West Sussex Then in November 2022, the government launched a new British nationality route which was widened to all individuals of Chagossian descent, living anywhere in the world, permitting them to be recognised as British citizens free of charge. Adults have five years, from 23 November 2022, to claim British nationality. Children born within the five-year application time have until they are 23 to apply. This predated the the UK government's decision this year to sign a deal to hand ownership of the Chagos Islands to Mauritius. Under the deal, the UK has agreed to pay £101m annually for 99 years to keep control of the UK-US military base that was built on Diego Garcia - the largest of the islands. The deal has not gone down well with many Chagossians, who see it as a betrayal and want to see the UK retain sovereignty over the islands so they can one day return to their homeland. Some fear they could be prosecuted by Mauritian authorities for supporting UK sovereignty over the Chagos Archipelago. Damien Dursonial, 35, landed at Heathrow with his wife and two children, aged four and six, on Wednesday this week. Born in Mauritius, where he worked as a police constable, Mr Dursonial saved up for two years and sold his motorcycle to pay for the flights to the UK. ""I came to the UK because it was the only place where we could feel safe, respected and recognised as a British citizen,"" Mr Dursonial said. ""As a Chagossian in Mauritius, we faced real threats by simply identifying as British or supporting UK sovereignty over the Chagos islands."" Mr Dursonial and his family have been placed in temporary accommodation by Hillingdon Council, in West London. But he said: ""The government should have done this because all this work is falling on a local council. ""It had to spend about £1.2m. Whereas ministers are giving away the Chagos Archipelago and taxpayer funds to Mauritius."" Steve Tuckwell says the cost of housing arrivals is ""breaking the council"" Hillingdon Council says it is at risk of going effectively bankrupt and has put in a request for exceptional financial support from the government. It is aiming to cut spending by £38m this year, the largest savings target the council has ever undertaken. ""It's breaking the council,"" Steve Tuckwell, the cabinet member for planning, housing and growth at the Conservative-run council, told the BBC. ""It's taking away hard-earned taxpayers' money from core services."" Tuckwell, a former Tory MP, said the council had written to ministers asking for funding to support Chagossians but had not received any responses. ""I'm calling on the government to do the right thing,"" Tuckwell said. ""Stop this burden on Hillingdon taxpayers. The bank account is running dry."" The Chagos Islands have been under British control since 1814 and became formally established as an overseas territory after the UK government bought the Chagos Archipelago from Mauritius in 1965. The islanders were evicted between 1967 and 1973 to create a joint UK-US military base on Diego Garcia. The global population of Chagossians is estimated to be about 10,000, with many of them living in Mauritius, the Seychelles or the UK. Vanessa Mandarin Calu, who works with Biot Citizen, said many British-Chagossians were temporarily settling in the UK while they wait to return to their homeland. ""Our homeland is a British Overseas Territory - the government should create a clear pathway for British-Chagossians instead of handing our territory to another country without consulting us,"" Ms Mandarin Calu said. Hillingdon Council opened a pop-up processing centre in the borough this week to deal with the surge in Chagossian arrivals. Local authorities have a legal duty to help eligible people who are homeless and provide temporary accommodation for families with dependents. As British citizens, people of Chagossian descent are entitled to the same support as any other homeless person with a UK passport. The council says it is already struggling to support asylum seekers placed in the borough by the Home Office. A government spokesperson said: ""Chagossians travelling to the United Kingdom are expected to arrange their own accommodation prior to arrival. ""Hillingdon Council has received funding to provide support in cases where immediate local pressures arise and cannot be resolved through standard contingency measures, with support for all local authorities kept under ongoing review. ""This is completely unrelated to the Diego Garcia Military Base agreement signed with Mauritius. ""In November 2022, the last government launched a route to British citizenship for the descendants of those born on the Chagos Archipelago. The Diego Garcia agreement has no impact on this.""",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cd721j8390zo,politics,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/8370/live/76292040-a5d1-11f0-b98a-8b079c99c55e.jpg,2025-10-11T06:39:14.322000+00:00,f247100993cb8f1f9985d32d121f920e383535e3

bf2824c76da6,"Jonathan Powell had no role in dropping of China spy case, senior minister says",,"The government’s national security adviser had no involvement in the prosecution being dropped against two British men accused of spying for China, a senior cabinet minister has said. Jonathan Powell had no connection to discussions about the “substance or the evidence” of the case, Bridget Phillipson said on Sunday, adding that Keir Starmer had full confidence in him. Powell’s role has been under intense scrutiny since it emerged that the sudden abandonment of the prosecution in September appeared to be because Starmer’s government was unwilling to say that China posed a threat to UK national security, a decision to which Powell would appear to be central. According to reports, the cases against Christopher Cash, a parliamentary researcher, and Christopher Berry, a researcher based in China, were dropped after Powell said China would not be described as an enemy in any trial – considered necessary for a successful prosecution under the Official Secrets Act. Cash and Berry deny accusations that they provided information about Westminster to China’s politburo. Under the updated national security strategy released in June, China was listed as a “geostrategic challenge” rather than an enemy. Appearing on the BBC’s Sunday With Laura Kuenssberg show, Phillipson was asked why the case had lapsed. She said: “Obviously, the Crown Prosecution Service are best placed to explain why they were not able to bring forward a prosecution, but what I can be absolutely clear about is that ministers and others, including the national security adviser, had no role to play in either the substance of the case or the evidence in question.” Speaking earlier on Sky News’s Sunday Morning With Trevor Phillips, the education secretary was asked for assurances that Powell took no part in the decision. “Yes, I can give that assurance,” Phillipson replied. “We’re very disappointed that the CPS were not able to take forward the prosecution.” Asked if the prime minister still had full confidence in Powell, she said he did. The centrality of government decision-making emerged last week when Stephen Parkinson, the director of public prosecutions, wrote to the chairs of two parliamentary select committees to say that the case was dropped after ministers and officials declined to set out that Beijing represented a “threat to the national security of the UK”, despite what he called “many months” of efforts. This is key because of case law relating to the Official Secrets Act, which emerged after Cash and Berry were charged. This, connected to the separate trial of six Bulgarian nationals found guilty of spying for Russia, clarified that under the act, a country must be a threat to the UK’s national security at the time of the offence, prompting the need for clarification from the government. Phillipson told the BBC that because some of the legal changes dated back to 2023, it was a matter for the previous Conservative government. “I’m not making a partisan point when I say this, but there was a different government in office then,” she said. Speaking on the same programme, Priti Patel, the shadow foreign secretary, said: “I’d say it’s utter nonsense and that’s a bold statement from her. I was home secretary for over three years and we were absolutely crystal clear that China was a threat, an adversary.”",https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/oct/12/jonathan-powell-no-role-dropping-china-spy-case-senior-minister-says,politics,BBC,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7c7106d5666d095a082dc707126b184e062f8535/366_57_3596_2876/master/3596.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=98234d922e2e577544a36ab9c38041fa",2025-10-12T16:26:07+00:00,f313dfcbaa6bfda95ad9aa84bbf0799c9cf31e30
c650ed8e9ace,Lucy Powell calls on Labour not to ‘write off’ May local elections,,"Labour should not “write off” next May’s elections as a likely moment for big losses but use the budget as a way to seize back voters’ attention, Lucy Powell has said as the battle to be the party’s deputy leadership entered its final period. With voting among party members under way, Bridget Phillipson , Powell’s rival for the post, said if she won she would set up a formal system to reflect the views of members and unions to the cabinet on a regular basis. Powell was sacked from the cabinet in last month’s reshuffle after the departure of Angela Rayner and has become the favourite to win on an outsider platform, promising to present tough truths to Keir Starmer and his team when necessary. Speaking after a series of events with members over the weekend, Powell said there was concern about the possible impact on the party of the elections for the Scottish and Welsh parliaments and councils across England next May, with Labour predicted to see heavy losses, many to Reform UK. Powell, who was leader of the Commons until the reshuffle, said she was “not prepared to write off this hugely important set of elections” as inevitable midterm pushback, calling for a bold budget in response. “It’s not OK if we are losing good Labour councillors and councils through no fault of their own, because of the missteps we’ve taken nationally,” she said. “We need to reset the agenda so that more communities don’t wake up to Reform and other councils after election day next May.” The 26 November budget should be “a moment to draw a line under our past mistakes, and show the country whose side we are on”, Powell said, saying it should lift the two-child benefit cap and make sure the tax burden was shared more fairly. Speaking on BBC One’s Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg, Phillipson, the education secretary, indicated she believed the cap would be lifted. “I am confident that we as a government will do the right thing by children growing up in poverty in our country,” she said. “We’ve already started that process. There’s more to do. I will make that happen.” Phillipson argued that as a cabinet minister she could make sure members’ concerns were heard directly at the top of government. In a subsequent pledge, her team said she would formally solicit views from members and trade unions every three months to present in this way. She said: “The Labour party draws its strength from its members. That’s why I want to give them a stronger voice in how the government delivers its agenda, with more avenues for our movement to tell us about their priorities. “Only under my deputy leadership will members have their voices heard loud and clear at the cabinet table.” Electronic voting among party members began last Wednesday and will run until 23 October, with the result announced two days later.",https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/oct/12/lucy-powell-calls-on-labour-not-to-write-off-may-local-elections,politics,BBC,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/76ab272bb5d2ecfbb71be150d5f8572aba021427/254_0_3099_2480/master/3099.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=636f15cf5b081eb1160cfd43ac2c4c7d",2025-10-12T16:00:21+00:00,b38b8c9a89ef79a170dcffbfb1a29dc4220c81cd
6bcca05532c9,William Hill owner says it could shut shops if Reeves raises gambling taxes,,"The debt-laden company behind William Hill is considering closing up to 200 betting shops if Rachel Reeves’s autumn budget raises taxes on the gambling sector. Evoke, formerly known as 888, which acquired William Hill in a £2bn takeover in 2022, is drawing up plans for different scenarios before expected gambling tax increases in the chancellor’s budget on 26 November. Evoke is considering shutting a number of outlets, in news first reported by the Sunday Times , which said closures could range from 120 shops to closer to 200. This would amount to between 9% and 15% of William Hill’s chain of 1,300 betting shops, with up to 1,500 jobs potentially affected. Between five and 10 people typically work in a betting shop. Evoke, which also owns the 888 and Mr Green brands, has 10,000 staff in total. The FTSE 250 company is struggling under a debt pile of £1.8bn after its largely debt-funded acquisition of William Hill, and made a pre-tax loss of nearly £78m in the first half of the year. A spokesperson for Evoke said: “We are mindful of potential tax increases in the forthcoming budget which would impact investment in the UK and drive more customers to the black market. “As part of our ongoing planning, we are assessing the potential impact of different overall tax scenarios on our UK operations. This includes the difficult but necessary consideration for shop closures.” The company stressed that no decision had been taken yet. It is the second big gambling company to warn of the impact of tax rises within a week. Stella David, the chief executive of Entain, the FTSE 100 owner of Ladbrokes and Coral, also said higher gambling taxes could lead to shop closures and investment being diverted to other countries. The government has been consulting on gambling taxation, and wants to simplify the various rates of duty applied to gambling products – a move the sector fears would raise its overall tax bill. A Treasury spokesperson said: “We are consulting on bringing online betting in line with other forms of online gambling to cut down bureaucracy. It is not about increasing or decreasing tax rates, and we welcome all views.” skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Business Today Get set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morning Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

5896dcb868dc,UK ministers take control of £10bn Lower Thames Crossing,,"Ministers have stripped the government’s road-building agency of responsibility for a £10bn tunnel under the River Thames amid a drive by Keir Starmer’s cabinet to take tight control over important infrastructure projects for fear of cost overruns and delays. Oversight of the Lower Thames Crossing – the UK’s largest planned infrastructure project – has been taken away from National Highways and handed to the Department for Transport (DfT). An artist’s impression of the Lower Thames Crossing, southern tunnel entrance. Photograph: Joas Souza/National Highways Internal consultation documents, seen by the Guardian, said the costs of the Lower Thames Crossing would be overseen by the DfT, leaving National Highways to “focus on managing, maintaining and renewing the network”. However, campaigners warned that the move could in fact lead to HS2-levels of overspending and ministers approving developments behind closed doors that would harm the environment. Treasury officials are thought to be behind the shift to centralise the management of large infrastructure projects after the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, made clear her frustration at “ bats and newts” delaying major schemes and adding to the final costs. The consultation documents showed that the “Tier 1” project – which is considered by the DfT to be “one of the largest, highest risk, novel and/or contentious” schemes now being undertaken – would be overseen by the transport secretary, Heidi Alexander . Reeves and Starmer have put planning reform at the heart of their growth plans after drafting legislation earlier this year to make it easier to build without paying as much for expensive wildlife protection . The chancellor is keen to include a number of initiatives designed to allow developers to build houses and infrastructure projects, in the hope that higher economic growth will fill about £3bn of an estimated £30bn shortfall in the Treasury’s finances. Earlier this week, Reeves was taped claiming that she had unblocked a development of 20,000 homes that was being held up by a rare snail. The new Thames crossing has received final planning consent and secured £590m for early-stage excavation, surveys and consultations. In addition, the construction firm Balfour Beatty has landed a £1.2bn contract to build roads connecting to the tunnel. However, funding for the full project has been delayed while the chancellor searches for a partner that could contribute as much as £2bn to the scheme in return for charging a toll. Work is expected to get under way before the end of the decade. The site lies east of the Dartford crossing, which takes traffic from the M25 and lorries travelling to and from the ports of Dover and Folkestone. A map showing the Lower Thames Crossing route Environmental campaigners argue that vital habitats on Kent’s north shoreline and the south Essex coast will be lost if the tunnel goes ahead. It will also increase carbon emissions without solving congestion on existing roads, they added. skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Business Today Get set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morning Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Alexander said earlier this year that the government was “finally getting on” with the crossing, adding that the “crucial project” had “been stuck in planning limbo for far too long”. National Highways has said that an extra connection between north Kent and Essex is also needed to allow for maintenance on the existing Dartford tunnels. It is understood that National Highways will remain responsible for the development of the crossing and will publish a breakdown of costs in its annual report, but decisions over the scope and funding of the project will be taken by ministers. A Department for Transport spokesperson said: “Backed by £590m, the Lower Thames Crossing is the most significant road-building project in a generation – and will cut local congestion, better link up motorists and businesses in the Midlands and north with key ports in the south-east, and spreading growth throughout the regions, as set in our plan for change.”",https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/oct/12/uk-ministers-take-control-of-10bn-lower-thames-crossing,politics,BBC,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f18b06fdec61cef41e7df16f5e0a342d5470d356/222_80_3161_2527/master/3161.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=b0d03417df9baa8687e53cc527babb5b",2025-10-12T14:00:56+00:00,1ba900632d1f12d073c254ee79d1886b13971f0f
40c8f01a1917,SNP backs Swinney’s ‘clear’ strategy for new independence referendum,,"SNP members have overwhelmingly backed leader John Swinney’s “clear and unambiguous” independence strategy that a majority election win is the only route to another referendum. On the first day of the party’s annual conference in Aberdeen, the vast majority of members backed the leadership’s motion that next May’s Holyrood elections should be fought on a “clear platform of national independence” and that winning a majority in the Scottish parliament – by securing 65 seats or more – would be “the only uncontested way to deliver a new vote on Scotland’s future”. After a passionate – and at times highly technical – debate, the conference rejected a rebel amendment put by more than 40 local branches that set out a more fundamentalist strategy of treating next year’s election as a de facto referendum, meaning that if the SNP and other pro-independence parties win a majority of the popular vote in 2026, it should be treated as a mandate to open independence negotiations directly. This de facto idea was first promoted by the former party leader and first minister Nicola Sturgeon, who acknowledged it as a “mistake” in her recent memoir. Echoing the confidence of SNP strategists reported in the Guardian yesterday, Swinney told the packed conference hall that “we are within touching distance of the 65 seats that will make the world sit up and take notice” and urged the party to back taking a “clear, unambiguous message” to the public. Depute leader Keith Brown, who seconded the motion, told delegates: “The only way we can achieve independence is to ask a clear question and get a clear answer.” This call to clarity is key: while independence is not high on the list of voters’ priorities, activists have unhappy memories of trying to explain what many believed was a fatally muddled independence strategy on the doorstep for the general election last year, where the SNP was humiliated by the resurgent Labour party, losing 38 of its 48 Westminster seats. A year on, the party’s pivot to its core message is a mark of renewed confidence, with the SNP once again leading the polls ahead of Scottish Labour and Reform UK, and an understanding that the battleground demographic for the coming campaign is made up of those “soft yes” independence supporters who have drifted away from the party. Speaking for the de facto amendment, veteran activist Graeme McCormick insisted that it was not proposed by “romantic nationalists”. He warned that the SNP was being “hollowed out” because it had failed to inspire its membership with a date for another referendum. The former MP Tommy Sheppard said it was “remarkable” that such a large conference was able to have such a detailed discussion in public and in front of the media, but insisted there were “no quick fixes”. “We have been chasing the next election for too long,” he said, arguing that the party needed a strategy to take it into the 2030s and deepen support for independence. skip past newsletter promotion Our morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it matters Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

c0205a5d40fb,"Tony Blair met Jeffrey Epstein in No 10 on advice of Peter Mandelson, documents reveal",,"Sir Tony Blair met Jeffrey Epstein in Downing Street while he was prime minister after a recommendation by Peter Mandelson, newly released papers from the National Archives show. Epstein visited Blair on 14 May 2002, after the suggestion by Lord Mandelson to the prime minister’s then chief of staff, Jonathan Powell . Mandelson was sacked as US ambassador in September after new information emerged about how close he was to the convicted sex offender. At the time of the recommendation, Mandelson was a backbench Labour MP but still served as a trusted ally to Blair. Just over a year earlier he had resigned from government a second time amid controversy. He had described Epstein to Powell as “safe” and a “friend” in an email before the meeting. Powell is now Keir Starmer’s national security adviser. His role has been questioned in the collapse of a Chinese spying case. According to papers released to the BBC, a briefing memo by the senior civil servant Matthew Rycroft described Epstein as a friend of Mandelson and the former US president Bill Clinton, as well as being close to Prince Andrew , the Duke of York. A spokesperson for Blair said the meeting was “long before his [Epstein’s] crimes were known of and his subsequent conviction”. A government spokesperson said Powell had only forwarded the request in his role as chief of staff. Epstein pleaded guilty to soliciting prostitution from a minor in June 2008. He died in prison in 2019. The release of the documents had been blocked by government officials over concerns it may affect UK-US relations. However, the National Archives has now released the document as a result of a freedom of information request. The BBC reported that an email from Mandelson to Powell a week before the meeting said: “Do you remember when Clinton saw TB [Tony Blair] he said he wanted to introduce his travelling friend, Jeffrey Epstein, to TB? “This was frustrated – TB said at the time – in the office for reasons (he says) he was unclear about. I think TB would be interested in meeting Jeffrey, who is also a friend of mine, because Jeffrey is an active scientific catalyst/entrepreneur as well as someone who has his finger on the pulse of many worldwide markets and currencies. “He is young and vibrant. He is safe (whatever that means) and Clinton is now doing a lot of travelling with him.” Mandelson went on: “I mentioned to TB that Jeffrey is in London next week and he said he would like to meet him. skip past newsletter promotion Our morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it matters Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He is a friend of Bill Clinton and Peter Mandelson .” He added: “The background on Epstein is that he is very rich and close to the Duke of York.” He continued: “Peter says that Epstein now travels with Clinton and Clinton wants you to meet him.” A spokesperson for Blair said: “As far as he can remember, Mr Blair met with him for less than 30 minutes in Downing Street in 2002 and discussed US and UK politics. “He never met or engaged with him subsequently. This was, of course, long before his crimes were known of and his subsequent conviction.” A government spokesperson said: “Jonathan Powell forwarded on the request, he had no further role.”",https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/oct/11/tony-blair-met-jeffrey-epstein-in-no-10-on-advice-of-peter-mandelson-documents-reveal,politics,BBC,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cb0c5d8cebe80342cf77ad8bdb1ac3c4c2bbdd88/0_107_1920_1536/master/1920.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=2d43cea75ce08f1cbcb88a5358f59094",2025-10-11T11:49:09+00:00,d18d1d163d0913d291c000771ccffd49678f3267
f39106ea967d,Revealed: Labour-run council using legal loophole to serve families with no-fault evictions,,"A Labour-run council is using a legal loophole to issue dozens of families with no-fault evictions, despite Keir Starmer’s manifesto pledge to outlaw the practice. Scrapping no-fault evictions “immediately” was one of Labour’s main manifesto pledges before its 2024 election win, but more than a year on, the party’s flagship renters’ rights bill has not been made law. Local authorities cannot normally carry out no-fault evictions – known officially as section 21 evictions – as they apply to tenancies issued by private landlords. However, Lambeth council in south London has been able to start eviction proceedings against 63 households because it created an arm’s-length body to manage some of its housing stock. Five families have already been issued with possession orders via the courts and two of those have had their homes repossessed by bailiffs. Another 24 have left properties voluntarily after receiving a section 21 notice. Internal council documents seen by the Guardian suggest that council officials have been planning to regain possession of the properties since at least 2023, but the full implementation of the scheme was delayed until after last year’s election. An internal briefing document from March 2024 read: “Advice received from democratic and legal services [is] that this is a key decision and it is too controversial to take during the pre-election period.” Plans to evict the tenants were made despite the fact Lambeth council wrote to the Conservative government in 2019, asking it to end no-fault evictions. The tenancies were overseen by Homes for Lambeth, a group of companies wholly owned by the council. It was established in 2017 as part of an estate regeneration scheme. As part of this initiative, the local authority bought back some properties from residents who had purchased former council houses at a discount as part of the right-to-buy scheme introduced by Margaret Thatcher’s government in 1980. The council then transferred these properties to Homes for Lambeth. This meant they were able to be rented on the private market, despite ultimately being owned by the local authority. At its peak, Homes for Lambeth managed about 200 properties across six estates. However, Homes for Lambeth is now being disbanded due to concerns over poor performance after an independent review by former senior civil servant Bob Kerslake in 2022. Kerslake recommended that management of the Homes for Lambeth stock be brought back “in house” to improve efficiency. About 100 of the homes were vacated voluntarily before eviction notices were issued. The council is now using legal measures in an attempt to regain possession of the remaining properties. In internal documents, it said this would help it meet the “most urgent” housing needs in the borough, including accommodating vulnerable families who needed temporary housing after being made homeless. Some residents tried to challenge the decision in court, but in June a judge ruled that current laws do not prevent councils from setting up companies to issue private tenancies. Jules Zakolska, 27, who received a section 21 notice in April, has been at the forefront of efforts to fight the decision on behalf of the affected residents. She said some have been driven to the brink of suicide by the stress. Zakolska said she and her partner, July Kaliszewska, 24, had also suffered severe mental health issues as they faced the prospect of their home being repossessed by bailiffs. Zakolska, a university social sciences student, has lived in the property in Clapham with Kaliszewska, a bar manager, for three years. She is autistic and suffers from fibromyalgia, a chronic condition that causes pain and fatigue. She says she is “traumatised” by the prospect of ending up in temporary accommodation. She said: “Lambeth just doesn’t care. It says it wants to provide housing for the most vulnerable people, but if it makes us homeless, we will become those people. They have created this issue and traumatised us. It’s not right. I’m struggling. Who wouldn’t be, with the prospect of becoming homeless? It’s taken over my life.” A Lambeth council spokesperson said: “With almost 5,000 vulnerable homeless Lambeth families staying in often poor-quality temporary accommodation every night, there are incredibly difficult choices to be made. To do nothing would ignore their plight. “When the opportunity arose we chose, legally, to use properties we own to house the homeless rather than rent them out privately on a short-term basis. “The majority of these homes have been returned to the council. We have supported tenants who needed help through this process, while successfully giving dozens of homeless families a roof over their heads. “This situation is just one example of what long-term structural underfunding of council services, the national failure to build the homes we need, and the ongoing housing crisis looks like on the frontline. “The high cost of housing in Lambeth and across inner city London is a huge driver of deprivation – a point we are working hard to communicate to government.” A spokesperson for the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government said: “We need to do everything we can to support people out of homelessness and we are open to new approaches on this. “We are spending £1bn on homelessness and building 1.5m homes, so we can tackle the housing crisis we inherited and help councils like Lambeth manage housing need in their areas.”",https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/oct/11/lambeth-council-legal-loophole-no-fault-evictions,politics,BBC,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3359343504e7dc51ab70643e89370e0b4de0cf62/683_0_6827_5464/master/6827.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=f8966e1b9662cd3746ac12cf280296ee",2025-10-11T11:17:33+00:00,768cf413f805716b220f4b3d236c5ea1d88e9d3d
382d275f6695,"The Guardian view on Labour targeting nature: the problem isn’t snails, but a broken housing model",,"I t began with gastropods. Last Tuesday, the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, told a conference of tech executives that she’d intervened to help a developer build about 20,000 homes in north Sussex that had been held up, she said, by “some snails … a protected species or something”. She added that they “are microscopic … you cannot even see” them. No one could miss the direction the chancellor was headed in. The snail in question, the lesser whirlpool ramshorn, is one of Britain’s rarest freshwater creatures, found in only a handful of locations and highly sensitive to sewage pollution . But Ms Reeves portrayed it as a bureaucratic nuisance. She then bragged that she’d fixed it – after a friendly developer gave her a call. It’s a bad look for a Labour politician, let alone the chancellor, to boast that green rules can be bent for chums. The scheme was given the go-ahead a day before drought was declared in Sussex, potentially giving water companies cover to breach their licence obligations – including measures meant to protect the snails. Ms Reeves won’t like being compared to Liz Truss, but the analogy works. Three years ago, Ms Truss railed against an “anti-growth coalition” of environmentalists, lawyers and regulators who, she claimed, were blocking Britain’s path to prosperity. Ms Reeves is framing the issue the same way: growth is the priority, nature the obstacle. But the public don’t agree. Luke Tryl of More in Common told a Conservative conference fringe meeting that most Britons can’t be categorised as “ nimby ” or “ yimby ”. They want both: to build and also to protect the countryside. However, when asked whether wildlife should be protected even if it delays or raises the cost of infrastructure, every single voter group – including Labour, Conservative and Reform UK – chose wildlife. Among the general public, 62% prioritised nature protection while 18% sided with building at any cost. The Treasury reportedly plans to gut green rules with amendments to its planning and infrastructure bill – ditching the precautionary principle, slashing species protections and curbing legal challenges. The bill, currently in the Lords , already allows developers to bypass environmental obligations by paying into a fund to offset damage elsewhere. Under its “environmental delivery plans”, ministers could disapply environmental protections in exchange for vague promises of ecological improvement within 10 years. Labour, significantly, is turning its back on the work of the Dasgupta review . This argues that nature is not a constraint on growth but its foundation, a form of capital on which the economy depends. Labour is not only rejecting that view but deluding itself by claiming housebuilding will be accelerated by dismissing concerns around conservation. The Wildlife Trusts points out that more than a million homes already have planning permission since 2015, but remain unbuilt. The real barriers to housebuilding are skills shortages, hoarded land and slow delivery. They need sorting out. Blaming snails, it would seem, is easier. Many of Labour’s younger voters are already tempted by the Green party, which combines environmentalism and leftwing economics. Now, by mocking green protections and cosying up to developers, the chancellor is giving these voters more reasons to jump ship. The problem isn’t the planning system . It’s a broken, profit-driven housing model that banks land and starves supply. Scrapping nature protections won’t build 1.5m homes , it will just bulldoze public trust and the countryside.",https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/oct/12/the-guardian-view-on-labour-targeting-nature-the-problem-isnt-snails-but-a-broken-housing-model,politics,BBC,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/33d22c32e1b9889c35a88e06ee05667588a092dd/329_0_4304_3442/master/4304.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=2e9683e3222c856e2225a65397fff8c7",2025-10-12T16:30:56+00:00,9af80332755b16e08e499dc65da5d37ab2ecb960
18fae14c0868,France is not alone in its crisis of political faith – belief in a democratic world is vanishing,,"E mmanuel Macron sounded like a man in grief. Not angry, not defiant, just a little triste . Europe, he lamented, was suffering a “ degeneration of democracy ”. Many threats emanated from outside, from Russia, from China, from powerful US tech companies and social-media entrepreneurs, France’s president said. “But we should not be naive. On the inside we are turning on ourselves. We doubt our own democracy … We see everywhere that something is happening to our democratic fabric. Democratic debate is turning into a debate of hatred.” Squeezed between vituperative extremes of right and left, Macron knows of what he speaks. But “ungovernable” France is not alone in its bitter, intractable divisions . Across Europe, in the UK and the US, distrust and grievance daily deepen political dysfunction and social discord. Macron’s words apply, in fact, to almost any country espousing democratic principles. Belief that democracy is the form of governance best suited to the modern world is dwindling, especially among younger people . Meanwhile, the public space grows coarser and more violent. Macron was speaking at an event marking the 35th anniversary of Germany’s 1990 reunification, a moment of great optimism. Yet, like France, today’s polarised Germany faces an acute crisis of political faith. Just look around. In elections last weekend, the Czech Republic followed Poland, Austria and other EU states in lurching towards the populist hard right, swept along on a rising tide of anti-establishment negativity. Support for opportunistic bigots who feed on fear, resentment and loss – while lacking credible policies on complex issues such as migration – is not an endorsement of democracy but its despoliation. This ugly rush to extremes is a vote of no confidence in the democratic system itself, exacerbated by reduced levels of participation and turnout among disadvantaged social groups. In all these countries, a national democratic consensus is woefully lacking. In declining, despairing Britain, where national flags are worn like comfort blankets, both leading mainstream parties are flailing; yet the alternatives are implausible or downright pernicious. In the US, the “home of democracy”, effective opposition to Republican one-party rule has all but collapsed, at least at national level. Striving to gerrymander congressional districts , Donald Trump increasingly resembles a dictator. Lack of genuine democratic choice and economic opportunity, fuelling alienation and revolt, beset countries as diverse as Morocco , Kenya and Bangladesh , all of which have witnessed recent upheavals. In the Philippines, Nigeria, Turkey, Indonesia and Madagascar, corruption and abuse of power have triggered anti-government protests. In Nepal last month, young people powered a “gen-Z revolution”. All these countries, in Europe and beyond, are different – except in one vital respect. Compared with authoritarian regimes such as China and Russia, their societies remain relatively open and free, for now. This is the fundamental challenge each faces: democracy isn’t working, or it is working so badly it risks being jettisoned. The once exemplary US – a paradigm lost – and fractious western Europe are faltering. And once again, less established democracies in the global south, and in central and eastern Europe, are frontline states in a reviving cold war of influence and values fought against the Beijing-Moscow axis. Like Moldova and Georgia , to name two recent battlegrounds, they could go either way. A crunch is coming. In its annual report, Freedom House, the US-based rights watchdog, found that violence, poll manipulation and repression marred more than 40% of national elections held in 2024. Global freedom, assessed in terms of political liberties and civil rights, declined for a 19th consecutive year. “Conflicts spread instability and thwarted democratic progress around the world,” the report concluded. In the US, a recent survey found a record 64% of Americans believe their democracy “is too politically divided to solve the nation’s problems”. In the UK, a poll of people aged 16-29 found 63% think democracy is in trouble . While young people “preferred to live in a democracy over a dictatorship by 57% to 27%”, only 35% said they would consider getting involved in organised politics. skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Matters of Opinion Guardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and more Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Short- and long-term economic issues – the cost of living, inflation, lack of good jobs, de-industrialisation, shattered communities, institutional failures, wealth inequality, globalisation, mass migration linked to the climate crisis, the busted myth of infinitely sustainable growth – are all factors. Untrustworthy leaders, reflecting falling moral standards, is another. Insidious election meddling and online fakery by Russia and others hasten breakdown. Younger generations are pitted against ageing populations. And there is hopelessness, as well as anger, about the mess the world is in, environmentally and geopolitically. For Andreas Reckwitz of Humboldt University of Berlin, all this discontent is rooted in an overall, profound and ubiquitous sense of loss. “Western modernity’s foundational lie” – the post-Enlightenment belief that human progress is constant and inevitable, that everything gets better over time, that life improves – has been brutally exploded by the experience of recent decades, Reckwitz argues . “Loss has become a pervasive condition of life … The question is no longer whether loss can be avoided but whether societies bound to ‘better’ or ‘more’ can learn to endure ‘less’ and ‘worse’.” Seen this way, rejection of failing democratic structures and the advance of demagogic throwbacks pledging a return to “the way things were” are more easily understood. “If politics continues to promise endless improvement, it will fuel disillusionment and strengthen populisms that thrive on betrayed expectations,” Reckwitz writes. “Populism channels anger over what has disappeared but provides only illusions of recovery. The crucial question then becomes: how to deal with loss?” Reckwitz has his own suggestions, involving resilience and redistribution. If anyone has a definitive answer, Macron, with much to lose, would surely love to hear it.",https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/oct/12/france-crisis-political-faith-belief-democratic-world-vanishing,politics,BBC,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5622669477b5eae1034bdd5e7b06e606031d3067/404_0_4492_3593/master/4492.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=c1d471c87aa33813482b70b453549c64",2025-10-12T05:00:42+00:00,2133eefdc3204ea52dee6e4981014d6e78b6ca47
286be389b0af,Don’t fall for the authoritarian hype – Reform and the hard right can be stopped in their tracks,,"N igel Farage portrays his Reform UK party as a unique phenomenon that has burst on to the global stage, its meteoric rise an exceptional epochal event. But this week, in every one of Europe’s major countries and from India and Thailand to the US and Argentina, hard-right, anti-immigrant, anti-globalisation parties like his are also ahead in the opinion polls. In last Saturday’s Czech elections, the rightwing, pro-Putin populist Andrej Babiš toppled prime minister Petr Fiala. National Rally , which has just brought down yet another French prime minister , is leading the polls for both the French presidency and parliament. In Germany, the far-right Alternative für Deutschland (AfD) is currently the most popular party. Hungary’s Fidesz party, Robert Fico’s pro-Russian Slovakian coalition and the Brothers of Italy are already in government, while the Freedom party of Austria (FPÖ), the Netherlands’ Freedom party (PVV) and Belgium’s Vlaams Belang – all hardline nationalists – are part of an international coalition of anti-internationalists, inspired by far-right propagandists like Steve Bannon , seeking to dethrone the international rule of law, diminish human rights and destroy multilateral cooperation. The populist nationalist surge exposes a new and unavoidable truth that democrats ignore at our peril: an authoritarian ethnic nationalism – once thought toppled with the Berlin Wall – has replaced neoliberalism as the dominant ideology of our age, giving us a world of firsts: “America first”, “India first”, “China first”, “Russia first”, “my tribe first” and often “my tribe first and only” regimes. It is this ethnic nationalism that helps explain why the world is now composed of 91 autocracies and only 88 democracies , and ethnic nationalism is the force behind the violations of international human rights law not just by Russia in Ukraine but in almost every one of the world’s 59 cross-border conflicts and civil wars. It is important to understand the underlying forces, common to almost every country, that have fuelled this new age of nationalism. It starts with a widely felt sense that a globalisation that was open but not inclusive has been a free for all that has not been fair to all. For more than a decade, leaders have not only been slow to respond to the millions who feel left out and left behind, but also to the changing balance of global economic power, moving us from a unipolar world once dominated by the US to a multipolar world of competing superpowers, and from a rules-based order to a power-based one. The ethnic nationalism that this has incited means free trade is giving way to protectionism. Where economics used to drive politics, the politics of nationalism is now driving economic decisions, and already more than 100 countries are running mercantilist policies marked out by reshoring and friend-shoring and by bans on cross-border trade, investment and technology transfer, sinking international cooperation to its lowest ebb since 1945. But all is not lost. The cement is still wet, and even as it hardens we can find hope in the common sense of the global public. In a survey by Focaldata , of 36,000 people in 34 countries we find a clear majority are more resistant to an exclusionary nationalism and more willing to embrace international cooperation than many of the leaders who rule over them. Across the world there is, perhaps surprisingly, only a small group of hardened anti-internationalists representing 16.5% of the global population (even if 25% in today’s US) who either feel coexistence between ethnic and religious groups is impossible or have a zero-sum mindset that if they or their country do well, it has to be at the expense of others doing badly. But there are another 21% at the opposite extreme, whom we might call committed internationalists, who either still see cooperation across borders through open trade as a positive sum win-win, or are what the US philosopher and writer Kwame Anthony Appiah calls “rooted cosmopolitans”. Nigel Farage 'doesn't like Britain': Keir Starmer takes dig at Reform leader – video The vast majority of the global public are somewhere in between: not narrow, inward-looking nationalists, as “America first” ideology would suggest, or all-in cosmopolitans. They are patriotic but don’t see the world as in a never-ending struggle between the “us” and the “them”, adversaries permanently set apart from each other in an unbridgeable divide. Do the majority in the middle prefer a duty-free or a dutiful world? Are they prepared to accept obligations beyond their garden gate or city wall? Yes, under certain conditions. A first group, 22%, will back humanitarian action to relieve suffering and are prepared to act out of altruism, supporting emergency help for disaster zones. Those we might call “good cause” multilateralists feel the pain of others and believe in something bigger than themselves. A second group comprising 22% are pragmatic multilateralists who want to know that any taxes paid out for international development are spent well. And there is a third group, 21%, self-interested multilateralists, who will endorse cooperation if they can see that it benefits them and their communities, whether it be through guaranteeing them food on the table or peace and security. So a clear majority can be constructed not just for humanitarian aid if money is well spent but also for global action to deal with global problems, like climate crisis and pandemic prevention, as long as this case is argued on grounds of enlightened self-interest, and if we stress the reciprocal benefits that flow to them and their own country. And thus for those who have long wondered whether we cooperate out of need or if we have a need to cooperate, the answer is both. skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Matters of Opinion Guardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and more Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

And while in-depth polls tell us that across the west, illegal immigration is currently the biggest national issue – and no one should doubt that it must quickly be brought under control – the snapshots of opinion also tell us that the public are even more concerned about what is happening in their own lives and within their own local communities. Last month, Keir Starmer spoke movingly about how what’s good about Britain can drive out what’s bad, doing so precisely because in most western countries, “broken” and “in decline” are the words people have for years most commonly cited when asked about both our economy and society. But as the prime minister also reminded us, the far right is more interested in exploiting grievances than ending them. Farage hailed Liz Truss’s disastrous mini-budget as “ the best Conservative budget since 1986 ”. But he would also enact Truss act two – what she planned to deliver – the biggest ever cuts in public services. Reform’s plan to reduce public spending by £275bn would not repair downtrodden communities but ravage them, turn citizen against citizen and wreck any spirit of solidarity. Under a Farage hard-right regime, you will not be able to afford to be sick, disabled, poor or vulnerable. Every day from now on, and in every constituency, Reform should be asked which hospital, which school and which public service will be the first to be cut or closed. “Faragism” is neoliberalism at its most inhumane, more destructive even than monetarism, and vindictive far beyond austerity. What the public are telling us all over the west is that they want their governments to rebuild our economies and our civic societies . “Reform” and its global allies should be exposed day after day for policies that would devastate both. And for those of us who believe our best days could be ahead of us, we can go beyond highlighting Reform’s hypocrisy by setting out a case for a better Britain that appeals not just to idealists, but to pragmatists, to self-interest, and to the everyday compassion of the British people.",https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/oct/11/reform-nigel-farage-hard-right-politics-gordon-brown-labour,politics,BBC,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/47f88d36ac4c240f8bd0bb64e9786d1fd1839191/1122_0_6436_5151/master/6436.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=febc73ddb146d4cbf657336b940b2883",2025-10-11T09:00:20+00:00,6ff5a86b90109092b817a5bde8dd5cccc005e2a1
3a023e18e83e,Why should you be Labour’s next deputy leader? Guardian readers quiz the candidates,,"What would you do to tackle the cost of living crisis that has ravaged working-class communities? Stephen Heinson , Cardiff Bridget Phillipson: I wouldn’t be here without Labour governments. They spurred me on my journey from a tough council street in the north-east all the way to the cabinet. We had no heating upstairs when I was growing up, and we struggled with damp. But that story’s not unique: it’s shared by so many working people across Britain. That’s why I have been fighting for changes that will make a difference to working families. Such as reviving Sure Start for a new generation, funding childcare from nine months old, rolling out free breakfast clubs, expanding free school meals for half a million more children and capping the branded items schools can require. Together these changes save working-class families thousands of pounds. As co-chair of the Child Poverty Taskforce, I am clear everything is on the table, including removing the two-child limit. As deputy leader I would continue fighting for policies that change the lives of working people: investment in public services, ensuring the full delivery of our employment rights bill so people get fair pay for a fair day’s work – change that makes Labour members proud of this government, proud to campaign, proud to win again. Lucy Powell: The cost of living crisis, Covid, austerity and the global financial crisis have all hit working-class communities hardest. Each has deepened inequalities in class, region, education and opportunity. Addressing this is what this Labour government is about. We have an economy that serves the few, not the many – a “trickle-down” model that needs rewiring. I want to see a much stronger sense that tackling economic inequality and fairness unites everything we do. That’s one of the reasons I strongly support lifting the two-child benefit cap at the forthcoming budget, looking at Gordon Brown’s measures on gambling taxes to pay for it. As deputy, I would help to seize back the political megaphone to set the terms of the debate, being clear about what we are doing to reshape the economy in the interests of working-class communities – buses and trains back in public hands, a new energy company, GB Energy, owned by us all, more dignity and security in work and at home with the employment bill and renters rights bill. The job of the deputy leader isn’t to write a separate budget or policy programme but to ensure that our values shine through, and what we are doing is rooted in the communities we are here to serve. Stephen Heinson: Sadly, neither candidate seems able to acknowledge that the cost of living crisis is really a crisis of our failed economic model. There’s a direct link between declining living standards and unrestrained corporate greed: the private energy companies skimming off huge profits from ballooning household bills, for instance, or the property developers and letting agents cashing in on renters’ misery in a broken housing market. Tackling this crisis meaningfully would mean defying the corporate interests of Labour’s CEO donors. How are you going to address the rise of the far right in this country? Dominique Sandring , London BP: The Labour movement has been defined for generations by our core values – solidarity, compassion, fairness and social justice. As deputy leader, I’d campaign with hope and optimism, underpinned always by those Labour values that mean so much to our members. We should be proud of our values – proud to stand up for them, never ashamed of them. The far right feeds off fear and negativity, exploiting the struggles of people across the country and offering false solutions and empty promises. Let me be clear: we won’t win by parroting the language of Reform UK and Nigel Farage. We are Labour and we must govern, campaign, and win as Labour. We must deliver on the change that we promised voters so we can build the society we all want to see. That means expanding free school meals, renewing Sure Start and reforming employment rights to make work pay. It is only a united Labour party, the greatest vehicle for social justice this country has ever seen, that can deliver real change in our communities and country. LP: Fighting the forces of division and hate is the challenge of our age. The future of our democracy depends on us winning the battle of hearts and minds, showing that mainstream progressive politics is a force for change. We’ve got to up our game. As deputy leader I would help Labour do that. We shouldn’t try to out-Reform Reform UK. Nigel Farage wants the country to believe that immigrants are the root cause of all our problems. I wholeheartedly reject that. Yes, we need secure and strong borders as a foundation of a secure and fair country, but the reasons for deep-seated inequalities go much deeper. We need to seize back the political megaphone and set out far more strongly our diagnosis of what is really wrong with this country, and what Labour is doing to fix it. We have an economy that hasn’t worked for ordinary people for decades. From Margaret Thatcher to austerity, Covid and the energy crisis, those with wealth and assets have done well. For everyone else, life has got harder and less secure. We need to show that every single thing we are doing is in service of addressing this – to tell our own story about how we’re fixing the real problems. Dominique Standring: Reading the answers side by side, my sense is that Lucy Powell has answered the question better in that she has identified that Reform are winning the battle of hearts and minds – and that Labour’s message is not cutting through. Bridget Phillipson talks of Labour’s values being “solidarity, compassion, fairness, and social justice”, but I have not seen much evidence of this with the Labour government: from its stance on family reunification for those with visas to the genocide in Gaza and focus on ID cards. Crucially, neither of them have answered the “how” part of my question in any detail. Why isn’t Labour adopting a wealth tax? Can you give an example of a country where such a tax has been successful? Norma Spark , London BP: I’ve always believed in progressive taxation – it’s at the core of building a fairer and more equal society. The nature of our economy has been changing, with more people earning money from the wealth they hold; we have started to address that through the changes on carried interest, by increasing capital gains tax. And of course through non-dom reforms – you can’t simply be allowed to opt out of paying your fair share. It’s right that we all pay a fair share to deliver a better public realm, and that the broadest shoulders carry the greater burden. In government, I’ve put those values into action already, taking on the private school lobby to end tax breaks so we can invest in state education. I’ve been pilloried for it across the rightwing press, but I’ll never back down on that. I’m not afraid to take on vested interests to improve public services. The chancellor sets and makes our policies on taxation, but with a seat at the cabinet table and as deputy leader, I’d be relentlessly focused on pushing for more investment in public services so we can fix the foundations of our society and give everyone the best chance in life. LP: Let’s be honest, we need to tell a much stronger story about fairness and addressing inequalities, and whose side we are on. That must run through everything we do, including the budget. We have an economy in which those with assets and wealth do very well, yet for ordinary working people or those on fixed incomes, life has got harder and harder. Turning that round should be at the core of what this – and any – Labour government is about. That’s why I’ve been clear that the two-child benefit cap needs to be lifted. It’s also why we need to recognise how trust in us has been damaged by mistakes on the winter fuel allowance and proposed cuts to Pip. These measures did not seem fair. We need to give a much clearer sense of whose side we are on – and in whose interests we are governing. It’s not my job to write the budget, but it will be my job to ensure that what we do is connected with the views and experiences of our broad movement and the communities we seek to serve. Norma Spark: Bridget Phillipson cites steps the Labour government has taken or is taking to address tax inequity – all of which I applaud, but I hope Labour can be bolder. Lucy Powell recognises the need for Labour to “tell a better story” and acknowledge the mistakes it has made. This doesn’t address the benefits or pitfalls of a wealth tax. Last year, the G20 leaders agreed to engage cooperatively to ensure high net-worth individuals are effectively taxed. Neil Kinnock advocates an annual wealth tax of 2% on people with wealth of more than £10m. And Gordon Brown is advocating raising tax on the UK gambling industry to lift 500,000 children out of poverty. Though the deputy leader of the Labour party does not set the budget, they do have an important seat at the table. In advocating for options for a wealth tax, both candidates could signal their commitment to a more equitable and fair society and tell a good story! Would you tell Keir Starmer some home truths about policy, about sidelining the north-west – and about his perceived arrogance? Lee Stringfellow , Bury BP: I know this government has made mistakes – I won’t pretend otherwise, but I will promote our achievements. I have fought for policies that are true to Labour values – investing in state education by ending private schools’ tax breaks, reviving Sure Start, rolling out free breakfast clubs. I have argued for policies true to my values, to Labour’s values, and I worked with Angela Rayner doing the same. She challenged us as ministers to always go further for working people, to be impatient for the change they deserve. With my own mandate as deputy leader, I would continue that role. But I absolutely refuse to pit one area of our country against another. It’s the role of the deputy leader to bring all the parts of our party together, from every corner of our country. Last year I campaigned up and down the country to get Labour candidates elected, I’ve not stopped as education secretary and I won’t stop as deputy leader. With local elections and elections in Wales and Scotland around the corner, the role is going to be more important than ever. LP: This isn’t about personalities, it’s about how we use power effectively after 14 years out of government, and we have some achievements to shout about. The problem is they are being drowned out by unforced errors. Anyone who knows me knows I’m a straight talker, unafraid to be an honest voice. I told home truths on welfare, and maybe it wasn’t well received, but it won’t stop me speaking truth to power. But I won’t snipe from the sidelines or take to the airwaves. Discussion isn’t dissent – it’s vital if we’re to rebuild our electoral coalition. I really want this government to succeed. With the mandate of members I would have a strong, independent role, outside but alongside government. It’s a responsibility I would take very seriously and use wisely, but I think it’s self-evident that we can do better. There’s been too much groupthink, disconnected from the voices, talents and experiences of all of our broad movement, which is Labour’s strength. I’ll be that bridge with our members and elected representatives, pushing us all to be the best version of a Labour government we can be. Lee Stringfellow: All Bridget Phillipson has done with her answer is given a response Starmer would want me to hear. She has zero credibility as a serving minister to fight against the wrong decisions and actually listen to members. As for Lucy Powell: what is wrong with a little discord and actually saying what you believe – and indeed, what the party members and voters believe? This government has tied itself in knots with its no-sense fiscal rules and left itself with little room to manoeuvre; and all the while, who suffers? Normal taxpayers. We are heading for electoral oblivion sooner than we think if we do not grasp the nettle this year with some zinger policies that outflank Reform. Powell answered the better of the two – but I suspect Starmer will sideline her. Thanks for your answers, but this longtime Labour voter is now considering the Lib Dems. Why isn’t the government considering rejoining the customs union? What will you do to convince Starmer to see sense? Toby Hannam , Bristol BP: Back in 2016 I argued that Brexit would inflict serious economic damage on areas such as Sunderland. No part of the UK had more at stake than the north-east of England. That’s why I campaigned for remain and was one of the first MPs to call for a second referendum on the details of the deal. But those decisions are in the past – we need to focus on the future. What businesses need most now is certainty to drive economic growth and stability. The progress we have made securing an SPS trade deal with the EU is essential for British businesses, as are the protections secured for British steel. In my own portfolio we’re working on opportunities to once again boost educational exchange through schemes like Erasmus+, but of course there is more to do. I will say that I think we need to change this debate and challenge toxicity. Reform are far too happy to whip up anger about immigration, and I won’t do it. My family came to Britain as immigrants, and our story is shared across this country. I want to campaign and win on Labour values, not use the language of Reform. LP: I voted remain, and worked cross-party during the Brexit years on a proposal called Common Market 2.0, because I felt strongly that we needed to respect the outcome of the referendum, even though it was not what I voted for. One of the main reasons why we ended up with Boris Johnson as prime minister and a hard Brexit, losing so much of the so-called red wall, is because we didn’t listen and accept that a majority voted to leave and wanted Brexit. We shouldn’t reopen old wounds but focus on how we can make that botched Brexit deal better so ordinary people can feel the benefits – whether that’s action on e-gates to ease travel, closer ties on goods to lower food prices, or joint action on defence, security and irregular migration. People voted for Brexit, they voted for Johnson – and they voted for us in 2024 because they want change: more control over their lives and an economy that works for them, not just those at the top. The most important thing now is that we deliver the change people voted for. Toby Hannam: This is very much the party line response. The fact is we are willingly economically harming ourselves with the appalling deal Johnson and David Frost made. This idea that nothing can be done is symptomatic of the utter capitulation Labour have allowed. They’re too frightened to go near the issue due to the howling of the press and Reform – even when the benefits to the country are so clear. The deals that the government have obtained in office are such small beer. Other countries use the customs union and are not in the EU. Personally I would rejoin tomorrow. Without the significant improvement that the customs union could bring, our economy will continue to stumble on anaemically. The massive rebuilding that Labour wants to achieve won’t happen because they need at least another term. Why doesn’t Labour commit to building council houses? Sarah Woods , North Yorkshire BP: Labour’s £39bn social and affordable homes programme aims to deliver 300,000 new homes, 60% of them, or 180,000, for social rent – including new council homes. This is six times more than delivered in the past decade. It’s the biggest increase to social housing in a generation. I grew up in a council house in Washington, Sunderland, raised by a single mother and reliant on free school meals. I know first-hand the importance of council housing. Angela Rayner’s sense of the urgency of this was exceptional – she knew, as I do, that children need secure, warm, dry and safe homes in order to have the childhood and the opportunities all of us deserve. The changes Angela announced to the right to buy scheme – protecting existing social housing stock to meet housing need and delivering a fairer, more sustainable scheme – are essential. Councils will be able to retain 100% of receipts from the sale of right to buy so it can be invested in delivering more social homes. I’ve secured more than £600m to boost construction skills to ensure we have the workers we need to build housing – including introducing new construction technical excellence colleges in each region of the country. LP: We have committed to building more council housing – the biggest such commitment in a generation. Maybe people don’t hear enough about the good things Labour are doing, and that’s something I will seek to put right. The legacy Angela Rayner leaves on housing is a great one. As well as being a colleague and friend, I saw up close what an effective minister she was. More social homes, changes to right to buy so we don’t lose as much stock as we have been doing, a massive housebuilding programme and much more. Having a secure home is the bedrock of everything. In government I led on legislation, and I was proud we included a strengthened renters rights bill in the king’s speech. Sarah Woods: Bridget Phillipson has helpfully provided figures, but this raises further questions. The social and affordable homes programme has a 2035 horizon. Is the intention to build 18,000 council houses a year? According to Shelter England, as of 2023-24, there are 1.33m households on the social housing waiting list. In that year, their figures show a net loss of homes for social rent of 650. I am very glad to hear of the changes to protect existing stock from right to buy, but there will still be a loss through housing stock deterioration. Unfortunately, a considerable “Brexit benefit” was to lose free movement of workers, leaving a hole in construction capacity. It is good to see that Bridget Phillipson has secured funds to boost construction skills. However, this doesn’t deal with the immediate problem. Lucy Powell raises a very valid point on Labour’s messaging. I would like to see clearer messaging – Green party leader Zack Polanski is a breath of fresh air, showing how it’s done. Both candidates agree on the importance of a secure home. My husband and many of my schoolfriends were raised in council housing. The costs to this country from the failure of successive governments to replenish this asset are immense. A Labour government should be building with the rapidity of the 1950s, when 200,000 council houses were built annually. Do the candidates agree that reports that Earth’s carbon sinks are failing should be a turning point for humanity? Sigurdur Bennett , Edinburgh BP: The climate crisis is the biggest challenge facing humanity. I’m proud of the strong climate action this Labour government has taken to bring down emissions, showing leadership on a global stage. The weakening of the global consensus on the urgency of climate action is profoundly troubling, and Labour must continue to show that leadership. This is another example of where I’ll be ensuring we stay true to our values. I want the world of tomorrow to be a world worth living in, not a planet on fire, and the responsibility falls to us to make that happen today. We’re already seeing the effects of global warming – wildfires, failing carbon sinks , flooding. But with decisive action it’s not too late to turn things around. We simply must not let ourselves be blown off course by climate deniers and opponents criticising our vital net zero policies. LP: We have a strong agenda on the environment, and I’m proud to have Ed Miliband’s backing to be the next deputy leader. Ensuring there’s a just transition, tackling the climate crisis and achieving clean power by 2030 is a huge task, but one that Labour is up for. It’s not the job of the deputy leader to write an alternative policy manifesto – we were just elected with a strong programme on climate and nature. As deputy leader I would make sure that Labour is shouting about what we’re doing to improve our environment and motor ahead to net zero – and call out the backwards policies of Reform and the Tories, which would cost jobs and investment and worsen the climate and nature crisis. Sigurdur Bennett: Repeated failure of Earth’s carbon sinks now seems to be a serious possibility, which is frightening. Not that you’d know it from the candidates’ responses. Which might explain why the government may incentivise further North Sea oil drilling. What can you say about such an initiative? Only that it’s insane.",https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/oct/11/labour-next-deputy-leader-guardian-readers-debate-candidates,politics,BBC,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f18fb58e2c2ef78ea0b9d13f50db22de3c0ab58b/0_0_5000_4000/master/5000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=3ffbfe5e9808e6351591b10b93b69e6e",2025-10-11T05:00:18+00:00,ac7243c733be1ce3488a88d65af462b9e24ddcd2
d2390a6c3cd3,English democracy relies on local councillors. So why are so many facing the axe?,,"I t’s extraordinary that a profound reshaping – and shrinking – of our democracy is happening under our noses, and virtually no one notices. For baffling reasons, soon after the general election a government with a sky-high in-tray of problems embarked on a gigantic local council reorganisation no one knew about. It didn’t feature in the manifesto, nor in the local government secretary Steve Reed’s conference speech last week – but England has plans to axe unknown numbers of local councillors – some estimates put it at nearly 90%. The white paper outlining these plans actually boasts that there will be “fewer local politicians”, pandering disgracefully to the general scorn for politics. Yet voters trust councillors twice as much as they do Westminister politicians. For all the talk of localism and connecting to neighbourhoods, these are the unheralded foot soldiers of democracy. It is councillors who run political parties and much that binds their communities . Few people ever join political parties, yet the whole tottering democratic system relies entirely on those who do. Running the council and becoming a councillor is part of party members’ purpose and motivation. Abolishing so many will diminish democratic engagement over time. Many councils will be ordered to merge into unitary councils to serve a population of at least 500,000 , to deliver all local services; this will entail the abolition of hosts of district councils. (There is some “flexibility” for some with populations of fewer than 300,000.) Some won’t go quietly. Some submit alternative plans, grouping together so more of them survive. County councils, the winners from enlargement, strongly support the plan: today they launched a salvo urging the government to plough on and block their ears to the districts’ counter-plans. The budget approaches, a wretched brew of hard choices whichever way the chancellor turns. On all sides the beleaguered government faces bereft public services in need of money. The plight of councils is particularly serious: there is no money for social care’s escalating needs, Send children or the rising numbers being taken into care. There were smirks all round from other parties when Kent council, one of many captured by Reform, had to backtrack on nonsense promises for cutting of waste and taxes in its array of unicorn policies: within months Kent and the others declared defeat, finding few “net zero” and “equality” savings; it is likely to raise council tax by the maximum 5%. Council budgets have dwindled sharply as a proportion of all spending says Prof Tony Travers, local government expert at the London School of Economics, and now councils’ democratic voice will shrink too. Hoping to save money with fewer councils “rationalised” under larger unitaries means some will be enormous. North Yorkshire will be a three-hour drive across; forget delivery close to home. Is there a perfectly efficient size of council? “No,” says Travers. “There’s no evidence that Hampshire, with its district councils, is better or worse governed than say, Shropshire or Buckinghamshire unitaries.” Will this save money? House of Commons library research finds : “It is not clear from available evidence whether unitary councils save money compared with a two-tier system.” Portsmouth, one of the many towns and cities resisting , protests that its 208,000 population is an adequate size: it already delivers all services well, has no debts, and no wish to be swallowed by Hampshire. Susan Brown, Labour leader of Oxford city council with 166,000 people, is struggling to avoid being eaten by Oxfordshire into a monster council unitary of 750,000. She tells me she’s bidding to enlarge the city’s border to include its green belt, and become a unitary controlling all their services. All these boundaries will be marked out finally next March by the minister. Does anyone care much, when most are clueless about what councils do and few vote in local elections? Well they may sit up and take notice when it dawns on them that Ipswich, Norwich, Exeter, Reading and many more ancient towns and cities will be devoured by mega-county councils that feel distant, not local at all. It may dawn on Labour MPs that this is a reverse gerrymander, damaging parties of the left. Many of these lost town councils have been little islands of Liberal Democrat yellow and Labour red, amid deep blue counties, which will now outvote them. Besides, Reform will sweep through quite a lot more next May. Don’t lose these small strongholds. Britain already has fewer elected representatives than European countries of a similar size, says Travers. Cavalier map planners at Westminster never consider how reorganisations cause huge waste of time and effort. Council CEOs complain of time spent on this, amid all their other crises. What to do about contracts when the council may no longer be there? Who wants to absorb Thurrock with its £1bn debt ? Oxfordshire county council just signed an eight-year highways contract : can that be unpicked if Susan Brown of Oxford city gets her way? skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Matters of Opinion Guardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and more Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

efbbc07815b4,We all know Brexit’s to blame for the crisis facing UK steel – it’s time for politicians to be honest and reverse it,,"W hile Keir Starmer fiddles in India , Rome burns. The British steel industry now faces a calamity so severe, insiders say it could be “terminal”. The vast majority – 80% – of its exports go to the EU , which this week revealed plans to cut tariff-free steel import quotas by almost half. The remainder will be subject to a 50% tariff. The UK steel industry will be butchered. Thank you, EU. Thank you, Brexit. Whenever I meet politicians who championed Brexit nowadays, I ask them a simple question: do you still think you were right? A few fools mutter, “Yes, on balance” and “In the long term, perhaps.” The honest ones shrug and look uncomfortable. We can all accept that some day a new generation of British politicians will resume open trade across the Channel. It is normal for an island, and makes sense. So I ask the honest ones: why not go public? Make a headline, stand up, apologise and get the ball rolling? None has done so. In May, Starmer timidly negotiated a “Brexit reset” with Brussels. This injected pockets of sanity into increasingly chaotic border controls, especially on food. A few more EU students whom Brexit had crassly restricted may be admitted, along with a new e-gate for passport entry. There must still be checks – they start rolling out from this Sunday – to enforce the rule limiting Britons to no more than 90 out of any 180 days inside the Schengen area . Further resets are mooted in coming years. According to the thinktank UK in a Changing Europe, most industries just cannot wait. They are struggling to keep open markets, and if necessary realign themselves with the EU by the back door. The chemicals industry exports more than 60% of its output to the EU. Brexiteers boasted it would be liberated from EU regulation, but setting up the UK’s own regulator cost £2bn and has not worked. According to the Chemical Industries Association, output has fallen by 35-40% since 2021. Between 2021 and 2023, British exports to the EU fell by a serious 27% . Brexiteers boasted that leaving the EU would be worth hundreds of billions a year. Cambridge Econometrics estimates that over the next decade Britain’s economy will be £300bn smaller than if we had not left the EU. This is self-harm on a heroic scale. What matters is how to scramble out of the pit. For most politicians, Brexit was never a policy priority. It was a leadership stunt, conducted with the grain of Britain’s shambolic political climate in the mid-to-late 2010s. Parliament enacted what a majority of members on all sides of the Commons knew was wrong. Worse still, when a soft Brexit was a feasible least-bad option, the Labour party failed to unite with anti-Brexit Tories to retain trading links with Europe. A hugely critical national issue sank into a swamp of parliamentary infighting, on a level approaching that now being repeated in Paris . The excuse was that the public wanted it. There is no such excuse now. Voters have had the courage to look at the facts and admit the mistake. According to YouGov, 61% have concluded that Brexit is a failure. Just 13% now regard it as more of a success. Almost half want another referendum within five years, and 63% oppose loosening ties with the EU any further. That figure should daub every public meeting staged by Nigel Farage. The need is urgent for some coalition of politicians to take the lead and state baldly that Brexit was an error. Of the many failings of parliament, its inability to rise to the occasion above party politics is the most glaring. Britain’s re-entry into some trading relationship with Europe should now be the subject of a crossparty forum or select committee. They should press Starmer towards an urgent and concerted bid to reassociate with the EU. It will not be cheap, but it will be worth it. The leadership of the Tory party may find it hard to get its head round the necessary U-turn. That is tough. Its failure to explain or justify other aspects of its performance in government is already not serving it well. To accuse Starmer last May of “betrayal” and “surrender” over his EU deal was idiotic. There must be Tories who know the truth: honest politicians who follow Keynes’ purported advice and allow circumstances to alter their views. At present, as with anti-Trump Republicans in the US, the question is, when do they have the guts to surface? The public is clearly ready to see Brexit reversed. There cannot be a single industry that would oppose it. The need is for leadership. This should not be a partisan matter, except insofar as it might isolate Farage’s Reform party – and perhaps be his undoing. It should become a consensus. Of course it will not be easy. But it will be right. skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Matters of Opinion Guardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and more Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

d7609ad3a0d2,I saw desperation at the Tory conference – but all traditional parties may be in this position soon,,"M uch of democratic politics is about getting people’s attention. That’s a particular problem for struggling, less-than-compelling leaders. The further your party falls in the polls, the larger the temptation to launch dramatic, supposedly transformational policies. It’s like speaking more and more loudly to someone who has stopped listening. Thus this week’s Conservative conference in Manchester, with the party at historic lows in the polls, featured a frenzy of policy announcements, on once-successful Tory themes such as tax cuts, law and order, welfare and immigration, that were often made to half-empty rooms. Expanses of blue carpet had been installed in the huge, barn-like convention centre – as if to reassure delegates that the party still had an identity – yet much of the time they were eerily deserted. The Conservatives, famed and feared for their durability, seem to be disappearing before our eyes. Their current crisis, probably their worst ever, is not just one of popularity; but of leadership, political positioning, ideology and credibility. Within a few minutes of arriving at the conference, I overheard two delegates, both suited Tory Boys of the kind that traditionally express total confidence, having a conversation that would become very familiar, away from the fixed grins of the main stage events. “I don’t think the Conservatives are in a position to win,” said one delegate, self-protectively referring to his party in the third person. “They’re in a position to stay alive.” The other interjected: “If you replace her [leader Kemi Badenoch] now, you’re polling at 10%. I think she should resign in 2028. Be a sacrificial lamb.” The other nodded. “We don’t have many [leadership] choices. A lot of good people have lost their seats …” Even more drastic solutions to the crisis are also being considered. According to a new YouGov poll, almost half the Conservatives’ shrinking membership support a merger with Reform UK – the erasure of the Tories as an independent party after almost 200 or almost 350 years, depending on how you define their hazy origins. British Conservatives can be brutally pragmatic, and the defection of their voters, members and politicians to Reform may soon reach a tipping point. “As long as there’s a rightwing party,” another delegate told me who had been a Tory for decades, “I don’t mind which one it is.” Yet frequently in Manchester the Conservative crisis created not equanimity but feverishness. Each new policy or rhetorical trope seemed more rightwing, and often more authoritarian, than the last. Deporting migrants, deregulating business, disciplining schoolchildren, dumping net zero targets, detaining more minor criminals, dismantling the supposedly liberal judiciary: all the favourite preoccupations of modern rightwing populism and much older, free-market Conservatism were recited like articles of faith. Fringe meetings with hard-right themes were better attended than most events in the main hall, with chairs running out and sweat shining on speakers’ foreheads in fuggy rooms. At one gathering, Chris Philp spoke so fast, almost ranting, about the “scourge of illegal migration”, and how “many of those migrants in hotels commit crimes and work illegally”, that he sounded more like a hotel protester than the shadow home secretary. Elsewhere on the fringe, the Tory peer David Frost had an ominous explanation for why their party is radicalising. “A good chunk of the public is probably to the right of where [Nigel] Farage is.” The shadow justice secretary, Robert Jenrick, told a fringe event: “Public opinion is shifting very fast right now, on a whole range of issues.” In his speech from the main stage, he put it more melodramatically : “The collapse of the old order is in sight. A new one is coming!” Offstage, his replacement of Badenoch as leader was constantly discussed. Yet the argument that more hard-right policies will revive the Tories, under him or anyone else, is undermined by the fact that Reform, and Tommy Robinson, are already catering to that market. Moreover, Badenoch has already moved the Conservatives sharply rightwards without halting their decline. After years of austerity, acute inequality and growing public anger at the privatised utilities, Reform’s promise to address these issues, however partially and cynically, makes their reactionary populism more in tune with the times than the Tory version, which is still stuck in the 1980s, dreaming of a small state and endlessly dynamic businesses. In the more depopulated zones of this year’s conference, there were sometimes as many cardboard cut-outs of Margaret Thatcher as delegates. Badenoch’s speech on Wednesday – her second of the conference, a break with precedent that suggested a desperation to be heard – pledged “a new approach” to Britain’s problems. But it stayed in the traditional Tory comfort zone of promising to liberate individuals and businesses while reining in the state. Even the speech’s supposed big surprise, a vow to abolish stamp duty, had a retro flavour: a tax cut that would most benefit the wealthiest in the old Thatcherite heartlands of southern England. Nothing Badenoch said suggested that she or her party were doing the self-questioning and fresh thinking that their dire position ought to prompt. If you’re not a Conservative, and have suffered from their decades of dominance, it’s tempting simply to relish their difficulties. But the attention-seeking in Manchester this week was just the most extreme and undignified version of a neediness that also afflicts other parties, in an era of tuned-out voters, low election turnouts and political fragmentation. Liberal Democrat leader Ed Davey’s cartoonish stunts and Farage’s hyperbolic press conferences, while seemingly more successful as political theatre, are also pleas to voters to notice their parties. Meanwhile Labour’s conference in Liverpool last week, which tried to use attacks on Reform to make the government’s underlying principles more compelling, has so far generated no improvement in the polls . skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Matters of Opinion Guardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and more Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

4ff1ab93a1f1,Tories and Reform battle to be heirs to Thatcher’s legacy on her centenary,,"It is a glittering annual dinner in honour of the Conservative party’s most successful leader and, on the 100th anniversary of Margaret Thatcher’s birth, one that is bigger than ever. Yet as Tory grandees, celebrity backers and wealthy donors prepare to sit down at a gala dinner at London’s Guildhall on Monday evening, a battle for her legacy is under way between the party she once led and the insurgent threat to its survival, Reform UK. Boris Johnson will make a keynote speech at the event, the Guardian has been told by its backers, joined by the main speaker, Thatcher’s son, Mark, and guests including Joan Collins, Julian Fellowes and Jeffrey Archer. But a notable absentee will be Kemi Badenoch , as the current Tory leader struggles to stave off the threat of extinction looming over the party Thatcher led to three consecutive election wins. “There is a competition as to who is best to carry forward her legacy,” said the event’s main sponsor, Mohamed Amersi, who has donated £500,000 to the Tories in the past but, like other donors, has been backing Nigel Farage’s party more recently. He said: “There’s no doubt that she would have been sympathetic to much of what Reform are saying, though at the end of the day she was still a reluctant remainer.” Amersi said it would “take time but we will find somebody”, adding there was “not a chance in hell” that Badenoch was the answer to the Tories’ challenges. Badenoch is expected to appear instead at an official party fundraiser dinner in Greenwich. She has likened herself to Thatcher, telling Tories at their annual conference that she too was being written off like Thatcher once was. While Thatcher’s face was a constant presence at this year’s Tory conference, party sources say even many on its rightwing pay lip service to her memory while regarding her small-state philosophy as out of kilter with Britain in 2025. “She is very important though when it comes to mobilising donors,” they added. Many of those donors and those who were close to Thatcher are preferring to go to more private dinners. Among those is Sir Rocco Forte, the Brexit-backing hotelier who helped to fund Johnson’s election win and knew Thatcher. He remains tentatively supportive of Badenoch. He said: “I don’t think there really is a standard bearer for [Thatcher] at the moment in politics. I would say the Conservative party itself now is divided between a big faction which I would not even call Conservative and Kemi Badenoch, who I do still think is a serious believer in what Margaret Thatcher advocated.” Tickets for the sold-out Guildhall event ranged in price from £195 for an individual up to £3,000 for a VIP table. While there will also be Tory grandees such as Michael Howard at the dinner this year, they will be joined by Reform UK figures including its deputy leader, Richard Tice. skip past newsletter promotion Our morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it matters Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Tice said: “She was always about challenging the status quo, with strong conviction, and in a sense that is Nigel’s philosophy. The key thing is that she was a transformational leader of a country that was in trouble then, as it is now.” Events elsewhere include a dinner at the Carlton Club and an 80s-themed disco that Conservatives are holding on Monday at a location described as an ‘‘iconic central London nightclub”. Organisations that have been putting on events include the Centre for Policy Studies (CPS), the thinktank Thatcher co-founded and which provided the intellectual stimulus for her policies. Its director, Robert Colvile, said the Tory conference had probably gone “too far” by displaying her dresses in glass boxes. But he insisted that her political echoes remained powerful, pointing to a CPS event that was packed out by delegates. “If you look at the polls, she is consistently viewed as the most effective leader we have had. Her self-appointed mission was to turn around a Britain that was in decline and we are pretty obviously in that situation again now. Even people like Keir Starmer, while disagreeing with her policy, admit that they admire her for bringing change.”",https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/oct/12/tories-reform-uk-battle-heirs-margaret-thatcher-legacy-100th-birthday,politics,BBC,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8a15d5961b573f74f5ffc8396e485daaa59fd191/921_0_4658_3726/master/4658.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=6c34d340e0be1764e13134c3d5f5bdfc",2025-10-12T14:00:56+00:00,21057734a504112a0daf702bfb112ad9fb6b26f7
d86adcf17b9b,‘Brummies united against racism’: poster campaign takes on the far right,,"W hen Mus unfurled the leaflet lying on her driveway, she was left shocked, angry and upset. “White Britons are already a minority in London … it is clear that if these trends continue white people will become a minority in Britain,” it read. The leaflet, written by a far-right group, was distributed along her street three years ago in Moseley, a leafy suburb of Birmingham . It went on to blame NHS waiting lists, a shortage of social housing and even traffic on “the rising population”. “There we go again, blaming us for everything and causing division,” she thought at the time. But instead of ignoring it, her neighbours came together to figure out a response. “That’s what gave me hope, that people stood together and said ‘not in our names’.” They decided to fight back with their own words by creating a poster with the message: “Brummies united against racism and hate crime”. They were placed in the windows of homes all along the street. “Not long after, a neighbouring street said: ‘Oh, we had those leaflets. Can we have your posters?’” Mus said. Mus was horrified to find far-right propaganda on her doorstep. Photograph: Andrew Fox The campaign continued to grow and last year was endorsed by Birmingham city council. Now it has found renewed salience after a number of alleged hate crimes carried out in the city. Last month a Sikh woman was allegedly raped in a park in Oldbury, in what police are treating as a hate crime. A few weeks later in another park, a 12-year-old boy was allegedly beaten up in what his father described as a racist attack. A man in his 40s was arrested on suspicion of assault. “Operation raise the colours” in which St George’s and union jack flags have been erected across the UK has also caused fear and anxiety. Hope Not Hate and Stand Up to Racism said it had been organised by well-known far-right figures. The Birmingham campaign has been inundated with people who want to show solidarity with people of colour and religious minorities under increasing threat. “People are literally begging us on WhatsApp, can we have a poster?” said Anthony, who lives on the same street as Mus. To meet the demand, a fundraiser has been launched to print out 10,000 posters and distribute them across the city. “Birmingham is a multicultural city and I think it’s important to stand in solidarity with our neighbours, regardless of race, culture or religion,” he said. “Recent events such as flagging and rise of Reform UK are not things I feel comfortable with.” The campaign also hopes to spread beyond the city. According to Mus, activists in Worcester want to mobilise a similar, poster-led initiative. Like Birmingham, the city has recently had a number of racist incidents. Last month, swastikas and the words “no Jew” were painted on garages and on Friday a man and child were sprayed with an unknown substance in an attack described by police as “racially aggravated”. Mus said since the attacks she had avoided visiting parks for fear of being attacked. She is not alone. As a Muslim woman, Raiza* said she felt like a “walking target” in the city. She said her area was full of lamp-posts adorned with the St George’s flag. “I felt quite intimidated by it. I thought, how am I going explain this to my young kids?” One woman felt that Robert Jenrick’s attitude was ‘irresponsible and indicative of someone who doesn’t take part in the day-to-day life of the community he is commenting on’. Photograph: Ian Forsyth/Getty She has also stopped taking her children to the park after the alleged assault on the 12-year-old boy. “You don’t know who’s hostile towards you or who’s completely fine. My kids are fourth-generation British, so we’re pretty established here, but I haven’t felt like this in the past.” She feels that politicians have “done nothing to stop this”, adding “if anything, it’s been encouraged”. Earlier this week, comments by the shadow justice secretary, Robert Jenrick, complaining about visiting an area of Birmingham where he “didn’t see another white face” were revealed by the Guardian. Razia called the comments by Jenrick, who is seen as still harbouring ambitions to become the next leader of the Conservative party, “unhelpful, irresponsible and indicative of someone who doesn’t take part in the day-to-day life of the community that he is commenting on”. She has a poster, but she is hesitant to display it in her window for fear of being marked as a target. “We don’t know if we have any allies where we are living,” she said. “I think it’s important for white people to actually stand up and say, ‘no, I’m not having it’, now more than ever,” said Anthony. “If people want to wave flags and be patriotic, I have no problem with that, but the way that it’s being used now is to stir up resentment. It intimidates people, which I don’t think some seem to understand.” It is hoped that the posters will draw lines in the sand to fend off the far right and show solidarity to those feeling under threat. “People are really behind the idea. It doesn’t take a lot of effort to put up a poster in your window,” he said.",https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/oct/12/brummies-united-against-racism-birmingham-poster-campaign-takes-on-the-far-right,politics,BBC,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e306031449b36a3a35df4c311a007b7c99b75fef/610_0_5581_4463/master/5581.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=475ab66a4bc66673b680059a39913f66",2025-10-12T06:00:44+00:00,cfdabe3a97aae4eb09275a618211c4e3994209b9
2785e1d33eba,Rachel Reeves v the OBR: chancellor aims to loosen the watchdog’s grip,,"For a crew of 50-odd nerds sharing an uninspiring concrete block in Westminster with the Ministry of Justice, the Office for Budget Responsibility has come to wield extraordinary power. It was the OBR projections of Rachel Reeves’s evaporating headroom that left the chancellor scrambling for welfare cuts in March. And it is the watchdog’s rethink about productivity growth that means the chancellor is sure to deliver a second tax-raising budget on 26 November. The Treasury is determined to avoid being dragged around by the OBR in 2026. And so, as she draws up a revenue-raising package, the chancellor is aiming to accumulate more headroom against her fiscal rules, so that every £1bn shift is less make-or-break; and to downgrade the status of the OBR’s spring forecast. Set up during the Tory-Lib Dem coalition, the independent forecaster was meant to prevent politicians from tweaking economic forecasts to suit their own ends. As Labour came to power it embraced the new system, now 15 years old, with Reeves even legislating to prevent future fiscal events taking place without an OBR forecast, as she sought to remind voters of Liz Truss’s catastrophic tenure. Labour saw complying with the the watchdog’s strictures as a crucial signal to investors in government bond markets that the incoming administration had a clear plan for fixing the public finances. Led by the former Treasury and International Monetary Fund (IMF) official Richard Hughes, recently reappointed for a second five-year term, the OBR produces two forecasts a year by law, measuring the chancellor’s tax and spending plans against her fiscal rules . With Reeves’s tricky second budget approaching, it is the OBR’s decision to revisit its long-term assumptions about productivity growth that is causing alarm in No 11. The OBR’s view of this key determinant of economic growth has long looked optimistic relative to the consensus. The resulting reassessment is expected to put forecasts for the public finances in 2030 between £10bn and £30bn adrift of where they appeared to be in March. Reeves and her ministerial colleagues privately grumble that the OBR could and should have reviewed its productivity forecasts earlier. If it had done so while the Conservatives were still in power, Jeremy Hunt’s pre-election cuts to national insurance contributions might have looked unaffordable. Instead, with Labour already struggling in the polls, it will be Reeves who has to explain to the public that the economy is weaker than previously thought – and impose tax increases to make up for the shortfall. Tensions between the OBR and the Treasury have spilled into the open in recent weeks, with Reeves using an interview to call on the forecaster to “score” , that is to say include in its projections, pro-growth government policies. To avoid another spring scramble for savings, Reeves is also considering having the OBR assess her against her rules only once a year. As recommended by the IMF in May , the spring forecast would be indicative rather than binding – perhaps focusing on economic growth rather than the fiscal picture. “The IMF have said that we should move to just one major fiscal event a year, and I agree with their recommendations,” Reeves told Times Radio last week. “To be able to do that, we do need to change the way that the OBR do their forecasting. Two full forecasts a year make it harder to have that one fiscal event.” Hughes has expressed a distinct lack of enthusiasm for that plan, however – telling MPs at a recent Treasury select committee hearing: “The UK has been doing two economic forecasts and fiscal forecasts a year since 1975 … Were we to reduce the number of forecasts to one, that would make us one of the least fiscally transparent countries in Europe and of any major advanced economy.” Adding that his reading of the IMF’s recommendation was that if the government looked set to miss its fiscal rules in the spring it could “let it ride, and make more policy decisions in the autumn”, Hughes insisted: “The government have that option now, and they always had that option.” With Labour losing support in the polls, some of the party’s backbenchers have expressed concern about what they see as the OBR’s malign influence, with Louise Haigh calling it an “unelected institution” that “dictates the limits of government ambition” . Jo Michell, a professor of economics at the University of the West of England, said: “It’s really about how do you stop this silly dance where the government adjusts long-run plans to short-run moves in bond markets. Forecasts are not a bad thing per se, but it’s the tail wagging the dog.” The leftwing thinktank the New Economics Foundation has called for forecasting to be taken back into the Treasury , with an external Office for Fiscal Transparency acting more as a quality check and the chancellor making the final decision. It argues this would be a more democratic framework. James Meadway, a former economic adviser to John McDonnell and host of the podcast Macrodose, argues that it is impossible to drain the politics out of forecasting. “These aren’t neutral facts at all – they’re hotly contested, just like everything else in economics,” he said. He argues for the OBR to act more like the US Congressional Budget Office, which has a wider role in analysing economic policies, including costing opposition plans, for example. However, Jonathan Portes, a former government economist and now professor of economics and public policy at King’s College London, said it was a mistake to lay the blame for the government’s predicament with the OBR. “Are the current rules and the current horizons the right ones? There is no right answer. But the big picture is, that’s not the constraint at the moment – the constraint at the moment is the markets’ view of whether the UK’s position is fiscally sustainable.”",https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/oct/11/rachel-reeves-v-the-obr-chancellor-aims-to-loosen-the-watchdogs-grip,politics,BBC,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ff33dfa476f52d953898428179b241bf0362054f/529_55_2275_1820/master/2275.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=232c0f68c346a12756cbd95133c8637e",2025-10-11T06:00:17+00:00,55faae680a6d8d737b0dd0ee873d6cedc69f8f24
be9e4c47e93e,Will UK taxpayers get their £122m back from PPE Medpro?,,"The five-year unravelling of Britain’s most high-profile Covid contracts scandal involving a baroness, her husband and multimillion-pound government deals accelerated last week with a high court judgment against the company linked to the former Tory peer Michelle Mone . The judge, Mrs Justice Cockerill, ruled that PPE Medpro, owned by Mone’s husband, the Isle of Man-based businessman Doug Barrowman, supplied defective personal protective equipment (PPE) for use in the NHS during the pandemic. Cockerill ordered that PPE Medpro must return the sum of £122m, which the Department of Health and Social Care paid for the order of 25m sterile surgical gowns, under a contract awarded in June 2020 via the VIP lane. The chancellor, Rachel Reeves, hailed the judgment as vindication for the Labour government’s stated determination to recover some of the billions of pounds in public money wasted during the Covid crisis by Boris Johnson’s administration. “We want our money back. We are getting our money back,” Reeves posted on X . “And it will go where it belongs – in our schools, NHS and communities.” The June contract, and another worth £80.85m to supply face masks, also paid for by the DHSC, were granted to PPE Medpro after Mone approached the then Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove in May 2020. Her offer was processed via the “VIP lane”, the system operated by Johnson’s government, giving priority to politically connected people such as Mone, treating them as more credible than experienced PPE suppliers. For years afterwards, Mone and Barrowman through their former lawyers denied involvement in PPE Medpro, until in late 2023 they acknowledged their roles and Mone admitted they had lied . Michelle Mone first approached the the Cabinet Office minister, Michael Gove, in May 2020 with an offer to supply surgical equipment. Composite: Zuma Press Wire/Rex/Shutterstock/Indigo/Getty The gowns were rejected on inspection in September 2020 at the NHS warehousing facilities in Daventry, Northamptonshire, because their labels were invalid, and also signalled that they had not been certified as sterile, a life-protecting requirement. Cockerill ordered that the £122m be repaid by 15 October. Yet in this apparent tale of British justice finally restoring taxpayers’ millions paid out for unsafe medical supplies, there is a looming snag. The judgment is not against Barrowman personally, but his company, which has been left with very little money or assets. In fact, on 30 September, the day before Cockerill delivered her judgment, PPE Medpro Ltd was put into insolvency and administrators appointed. So although the company has until Wednesday to repay the £122m, there appears no realistic possibility that it can. In a series of public statements since the judgment, Mone has accused Reeves of inflammatory language after the chancellor jokingly confirmed that the government had “a vendetta” against the couple, and Barrowman has repeatedly said the judgment was wrong, “a white wash [sic] of the facts”. Neither had given any indication that they intended to fund the repayment of the money, until a new statement on Friday evening when their spokesperson said for the first time that the PPE Medpro “consortium” was prepared to discuss “a possible settlement with the government”. In November 2022, the Guardian revealed that Barrowman had been paid at least £65m from PPE Medpro’s profits, then transferred £29m to a trust set up to benefit Mone and her three adult children. The couple said in a BBC interview in December 2023 that Barrowman’s children were also beneficiaries of the trust. In a statement on 4 October, Barrowman’s spokesperson hit out at PPE Medpro’s supply-chain companies, saying the administrator could bring legal claims against them. It is difficult to see the basis for this, given that PPE Medpro accepted the gowns five years ago and has always argued they complied with the DHSC contract. Barrowman describes PPE Medpro and its supply-chain companies as a consortium. Barrowman’s spokesperson confirmed PPE Medpro’s profits, saying of the £203m from the DHSC, the company paid £137m to the supply-chain companies to source and buy the PPE, which left a profit of £66m for Barrowman’s company. Of that, according to the spokesperson’s figures, PPE Medpro made a £39m profit on the contract for the gowns that were never used. However, although Barrowman made so much from the PPE Medpro deals, and the couple have over the years owned luxury yachts, a private jet and prestige properties in different locations, there is no clear route to the government recovering even a penny after the judgment. The Guardian asked the couple’s spokesperson this week if Barrowman intended to provide the £122m so that PPE Medpro could repay the DHSC. The spokesperson replied: “We are unable to comment on any matters that relate directly to PPE Medpro Ltd. This is not an attempt to avoid your questions. PPE Medpro is now in administration and only the administrators are able to comment on the company. It is vital to make clear, to avoid any misunderstanding, that the court case and subsequent ruling was against PPE Medpro, NOT Mr Barrowman.” The Guardian asked the spokesperson to clarify if that meant Barrowman and Mone did not intend to fund the return of the £122m, or repay any of the money received from PPE Medpro profits. The spokesperson replied: “This is not what my statement said at all, and is a huge leap and incorrect for you to reach this conclusion. Let me be clear: ‘At no stage have we stated that Mr Barrowman has no intention of making any payment to the DHSC. We have been clear that we cannot answer any questions regarding PPE Medpro.’” Michelle Mone and her husband, Doug Barrowman. Photograph: Jeff Moore/PA Media The spokesperson added: “Furthermore, you include Baroness Mone – why? She received no money from the DHSC contract. Her involvement as an introducer was fully disclosed to the DHSC … so to connect her and suggest she must repay money simply because she is married to Mr Barrowman is both unfair and disingenuous and shows that you have a personal/public agenda against her.” In the new statement sent on Friday evening, Barrowman’s spokesperson said: “The consortium partners of PPE Medpro are prepared to enter into a dialogue with the administrators of the company to discuss a possible settlement with the government.” PPE Medpro is now bust – put into administration by Perree Ptc, a private trust company linked to Barrowman registered in the British Virgin Islands tax haven, which had a mortgage-style charge against the company. Barrowman’s spokesperson did not respond to questions about Perree, or the circumstances in which it had put the company into administration. The whole legal basis for limited companies is to protect the people who have put money in from becoming personally liable for all its debts: to give the owners limited liability. If Barrowman, who described himself in the 2023 BBC interview as the ultimate beneficial owner of PPE Medpro, and who received £65m in profits, does not wish to pay the DHSC, the legal routes to enforcing the judgment appear difficult. There are only narrow circumstances in which an administrator or somebody owed money, the government in this case, can get behind a company’s limited liability – “pierce the corporate veil” in legal terminology – and enforce payment from directors or shareholders. “There is no obvious, easy route to recover money from any individuals behind the company in this case,” Simon Walsh, a commercial litigation partner at SA Law , said. “The circumstances for piercing the corporate veil can include where an administrator proves that transactions have been improper, or fraudulent. This may not apply here and investigating it will inevitably be costly, complex and time-consuming. There is a real risk of a pyrrhic victory for the government in this case.” It appears that any process for seeking repayment of the £122m is separate to the long-running investigation by the National Crime Agency into PPE Medpro and whether Mone and Barrowman may have committed criminal offences, including fraud by false representation , in the procurement of the contracts. The couple deny any criminal wrongdoing. The NCA has confirmed that it began its investigation in May 2021, and in April the following year law enforcement officers raided the couple’s mansion on the Isle of Man and their London home, as well as the PPE Medpro offices. In December 2023, Mone and Barrowman agreed to a freezing order of more than £75m worth of assets, including bank accounts, wealth management accounts and shares held in companies owning luxury properties, after an application by the Crown Prosecution Service under the Proceeds of Crime Act. The NCA has not provided any detailed information about the time it is taking or when the CPS might decide whether there will be any criminal charges. PPE Medpro’s barrister, Charles Samek KC, complained during the high court trial that the NCA investigation was “long-running and seemingly never-ending”, and “hanging … like Damocles’ sword” over the company “without ever seemingly being progressed”. In response to questions about how long it was taking, the NCA has said in a statement: “Investigations must pursue all reasonable lines of inquiry. In serious economic crime investigations these lines of inquiry can be incredibly complex. It can take considerable time to ensure that a thorough, independent and objective investigation is conducted.” Illustration: Guardian Design Reeves has insisted the government is determined to recover money lost in failed pandemic spending, pointing to the establishment of the Covid counter-fraud commissioner among other initiatives. In the PPE Medpro case, however, it risks having spent more millions for an expert legal team led by Paul Stanley KC to win a hard-fought £122m judgment it cannot enforce. Government sources have not provided any information about what it might do if the money is not paid on Wednesday. The DHSC has declined to expand on the comments of the health secretary, Wes Streeting, who said on the day of the judgment: “PPE Medpro must now repay the government and the taxpayer £122m. My department will work closely with PPE Medpro Limited’s administrators to recover everything we can.” Daniel Bruce, the chief executive of Transparency International UK, a key member of the UK Anti-Corruption Coalition which was a core participant in the Covid public inquiry into the pandemic contracts debacle, said: “There appear to be very few levers the government has available to recover anything close to the £122m the high court has ordered PPE Medpro to repay. The whole case stands as a further indictment of the ‘VIP lane’ and the flawed, wasteful procurement of PPE during the pandemic.” This saga of the Conservative peer, her businessman husband, Johnson’s Tory government and the multimillion-pound Covid contracts has some way to run yet.

9e7e2fd304dd,UK to host international summit on Gaza recovery plan,,"The UK is to host an international summit on the recovery of Gaza, Downing Street has said, as Keir Starmer prepared to attend a multi-nation event in Egypt intended to finalise a truce in the Palestinian territory. The prime minister will be among an estimated 20 national leaders, among them Donald Trump, who will gather in Sharm el-Sheikh on Monday, with Starmer saying the aim must be to ensure a lasting peace after two years of devastating loss of life. As humanitarian groups geared up to send aid into Gaza , the UK has said that £20m in already-pledged aid will now be focused on water, sanitation and hygiene services. The funding will be delivered through Unicef, the World Food Programme and the Norwegian Refugee Council. The UK will also host a three-day conference organised by the Foreign Office’s Wilton Park agency, based in West Sussex, beginning on Monday afternoon. The event will include representatives from the Palestinian Authority as well as Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Germany and Italy. Other participants will include the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development and the World Bank, and private sector and development financiers. The discussions “will also cover efforts to support the Palestinian Authority’s own transformation and reform programme to ensure it can support Gaza’s recovery”, a Downing Street statement said, adding that while the process would be Palestinian-led, there was “absolutely no role for Hamas”. In a comment at the summit in Egypt released in advance, Starmer said: “We stand determined to seize this opportunity to deliver a lasting peace, and a stable, secure future for the whole region. “Today is the first, crucial phase of ending this war and now we must deliver the second phase, in full. “The UK will support the next stage of talks to ensure the full implementation of the peace plan, so that people on both sides can rebuild their lives in safety and security.” Yvette Cooper, the foreign secretary, said: “The UK has worked intensively with international partners in recent months to create the momentum that has led to President Trump’s peace initiative, and to support the ceasefire that is now in place, but we now need to work with the same intensity and urgency to develop a plan for Gaza’s recovery and reconstruction. “Gaza has been completely devastated. The ceasefire gives us the opportunity not just to urgently scale up humanitarian efforts but also to look to the future of Gaza’s recovery. Rubble must be cleared, infrastructure repaired, healthcare restored and homes rebuilt.” Speaking to the BBC on Sunday, Bridget Phillipson, the education secretary, said: “We know that we need to see a viable Palestinian state alongside a safe and secure Israel . That’s the government’s position. That’s what we want to continue to be involved in making happen and why the prime minister, Keir Starmer, is tomorrow travelling to Egypt.” Asked what part the UK had played in the ceasefire, she said: “We do have a role, but of course, the role of the US has been critical in this. We can all recognise that.” Speaking later to the BBC, Priti Patel, the shadow foreign secretary, said: “I think we have to be honest at the fact that Britain has had no role, no role whatsoever.” She added: “I think it’s extraordinary that Keir Starmer apparently is going to Egypt tomorrow when we’ve got plenty of domestic issues that he should be resolving and sorting out.”",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/oct/12/uk-to-host-international-summit-on-gaza-recovery-plan,politics,BBC,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/05db5169b643683a8fbce122f7804296b83cda85/435_100_1417_1134/master/1417.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=edb0027368d74ace55f247031b7d6ebd",2025-10-12T21:00:02+00:00,924679a4f4a29eb1fe9e44ed40fa7275b6830d0c
e589c8b84fca,Madagascar’s president says illegal power grab by military is under way,,"Madagascar’s president said an “attempt to seize power illegally and by force” was under way, as an elite military unit that joined protesters on the streets on Saturday announced it was taking over the army. The Capsat unit’s intervention comes after weeks of youth-led protests, which started on 25 September against water and electricity shortages and expanded to calling for the resignation of the president, Andry Rajoelina, an end to corruption and radical overhaul of the political system. Rajoelina said he was “in the country … managing national affairs”, in a statement released on Sunday morning. The newly appointed prime minister, Ruphin Fortunat Zafisambo, had said on state television on Saturday night that the government was “fully ready to listen and engage in dialogue with all factions – youth, unions or the military”. Rajoelina said: “The presidency of the republic wishes to inform the nation and the international community that an attempt to seize power illegally and by force, contrary to the constitution and to democratic principles, is currently under way.” Soldiers from Capsat , which brought Rajoelina to power in a coup in 2009 , said on Sunday morning that they were taking command of the military, according to a videoed statement shared by local news organisations. Later on Sunday, General Demosthene Pikulas, the head of Capsat, was installed as chief of the army staff during a ceremony at the army headquarters attended by armed forces minister Manantsoa Deramasinjaka Rakotoarivelo. “I give him my blessing,” the minister said of Pikulas. Pikulas admitted to journalists after the ceremony that events in Madagascar over the past few days had been “unpredictable”. “So the army has a responsibility to restore calm and peace throughout Madagascar,” he said. When asked if he called for Rajoelina to resign, he refused to “discuss politics within a military facility”. On Saturday, Capsat said it would not fire on protesters and called on the rest of the military to “join forces” in refusing. Late in the afternoon, members of the unit left their base in Soanierana district, in the south of the capital, Antananarivo, driving in armoured vehicles to the symbolic May 13 Square, about 3 miles to the north, accompanied by thousands of cheering protesters. A Capsat general said on Saturday that one of their soldiers had been killed by the gendarmerie, police under the command of the defence ministry, and a journalist had been shot in the buttocks. The UN said at least 22 people were killed at the start of the protests in September, but Rajoelina disputed this last week, saying 12 “looters and vandals” had died. The protests on the Indian Ocean island of around 32 million people were initially coordinated by Gen Z Madagascar , a leaderless group of young people who had been inspired by similar “gen Z” protests in Indonesia and Nepal , where the government was overthrown. Rajoelina fired his government on 29 September in response to the initial demonstrations. However, Gen Z Madagascar rejected this as insufficient, calling for the resignation of the president, as well as the leader of parliament and constitutional court judges, while protesters on the streets continued to shout, “Miala Rajoelina!” (Leave Rajoelina!). Some young activists expressed concern on Saturday about Capsat’s intervention, with one calling the soldiers, and opposition politicians who joined them in May 13 Square, “dangerous”. Madagascar is one of the world’s poorest countries, with a GDP per capita of just $545 last year , according to the World Bank. The precious gem- and vanilla-rich nation was ranked 140 out of 180 countries in Transparency International’s 2024 corruption perceptions index.

9edc815ecc6c,Restitution row: how Nigeria’s new home for the Benin bronzes ended up with clay replicas,,"In a corner of the new Museum of West African Art, visitors can marvel at a sample display of the cultural treasures that adorned the royal palace that once stood in its place: a proud cockerel, a plaque with three mighty warriors, a bust of a king with a glorious beaded collar. The artefacts, collectively known as the Benin bronzes, were looted by British colonial forces who went on to burn down the palace in a punitive expedition in 1897. In the decades that followed they were scattered across collections in Europe and America.

Photograph: Courtesy of University of Aberdeen Their return and public display inside the $25m (£19m) state-of-the-art museum in the city of Benin in Nigeria’s Edo state, co-funded by European governments and western enterprises, was to be the crowning moment of an almost century-long effort to reclaim Africa’s stolen art. Yet when MOWAA opens its doors on 11 November, the only Benin bronzes on display will be clay replicas – a far cry from the “most comprehensive display [of Benin bronzes] in the world” touted by authorities when plans for the museum to become their home were announced in 2020. About 150 original bronzes have been returned to Nigeria over the last five years, some on the initiative of private collections and some as acts of state by Germany and the Netherlands. For now, none are on public display. If the looting of the original bronzes took place in the context of what has been called the “scramble for Africa”, as European nations raced to claim overseas territories in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, restitution has in part resembled a scramble in reverse. Western actors tried to outbid each other to atone for their past, before authorities in Nigeria had settled old rivalries about what restitution precisely entailed. Benin Bronzes on display at the Humboldt Forum in Berlin in May. Photograph: NurPhoto SRL/Alamy “In the west, there was a race about who was going to be the first institution to restitute,” said MOWAA’s director and chair Phillip Ihenacho, without naming individual museums or governments. “And there was not enough of a focus on to whom they would be restituted to. “I think that there was a well-intentioned effort that was focused very much around being seen to be a pioneer in this area. But a lot of people in the west failed to understand the complexities within those countries.” Nigerian demands for the Benin bronzes’ return, first voiced in the 1930s, were widely shunned by western governments and institutions until 2007, when a consortium of European museums and Nigerian officials formed the Benin Dialogue group. On the Nigerian side, the group included not just representatives of the federal Nigerian government, but also of Edo state, where the kingdom of Benin was once located, and of Ewuare II, the descendant of the royal family that once owned the bronzes, known as the Oba of Benin. Which of these three parties were entitled to the bronzes upon their return has historically been a bone of contention. The Oba has argued that since they were looted from the palace, they should be returned to the descendants and not to Edo state. European participants in the discussions were of the impression that the conflict on the Nigerian side had been settled. Race to return In November 2019, the group invited Ghanaian-British architect David Adjaye to come up with plans for a new museum where the returned treasures could be stored and put on public display. Still, to the frustration of officials in Nigeria and activists in Europe, there were no concrete announcements on physical returns. The spring of 2021 was to provide a sudden step-change. In a March interview with the German newspaper Süddeutsche Zeitung, the director of Berlin’s newly opened Humboldt Forum let slip that the museum was considering leaving symbolic empty spaces where it had intended to display Benin bronzes from its collection, with the originals returning to Nigeria. The comment surprised German government officials, who were in west Africa to discuss repatriations with their Nigerian counterparts, and set high expectations among the public and other organisations. A flurry of activity followed: days later, Aberdeen University in Scotland announced it would also return a pillaged bronze. Then similar declarations were made by the Horniman museum in London, Cambridge University, New York’s Met and the Rhode Island School of Design’s art museum. Museum officials suggest the pace of these developments was also fanned by the Nigerian cultural heritage agency, whose representatives were jetting around the world to strike return deals. In December 2022, a German state delegation travelled to Nigeria with 21 bronzes packaged in crates in the belly of the government plane, an initiative pushed for by the then foreign minister Annalena Baerbock, of the German Green party, who was eager to make her mark a year into office. “It could and should have been a lot less hectic,” said one official directly involved in preparing the trip.

It was a grand, pathos-filled moment but underneath the surface, tensions that the Europeans believed had been laid to rest were bubbling up again. Present at the ceremony were ministers of the federal Nigerian government and representatives of Edo state, but not the Oba.

Photograph: Kola Sulaimon/AFP/Getty Images There was a personal flavour to the animosity: Godwin Obaseki, the then governor of Edo state, is a direct descendant of a former palace official who had been named Benin prime minister by the British after the punitive expedition and is still seen in some circles as a betrayer of the kingdom. Media outlets loyal to the palace accused Obaseki of having set up MOWAA in order to hijack the restitution process, calling for its occupancy licence to be revoked . Godwin Obaseki. Photograph: DPA Picture Alliance/Alamy The tussle over the bronzes was ended in an abrupt fashion on 23 March 2023, when Nigeria’s federal government announced in an official gazette that the Oba of Benin was the stolen treasures’ rightful owner and custodian, and that they must be stored within his residence in Benin City unless the royal family decided otherwise. The move caused howls of outrage among those in Europe who had been sceptical of the restitution in the first place. Centre-right German daily Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung called it “a fiasco”, suggesting that the bronzes would be locked away in the Oba’s private residence with no access for the public. This is unlikely to be the case: a former cultural centre adjacent to the Oba’s residence is rumoured to be earmarked as a designated future museum. “The new name will be Benin Royal museum and this is where they plan to store the bronzes,” said Benin-born Mercy Imiegha, director of Lagos-based Nomadic Art Gallery. At any rate, inter-Nigerian disputes should not deflect from the urgent need for the bronzes’ return, say restitution advocates. “The Benin bronzes in German museums would never have found their way to Europe if British forces hadn’t invaded the Benin Kingdom and sacked the royal palace,” said Barbara Plankensteiner, director of Hamburg’s Museum am Rothenbaum and co-spokesperson of the Benin Dialogue group. “We are looking at the largest theft of a royal treasure in history. There was a moral imperative for them to be returned to Africa with no strings attached.” Benin bronzes at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York. Photograph: Art2010/Alamy Andreas Goergen, a former secretary general of the German Federal Ministry for Culture and the Media, said: “Dealing with the art objects of traditional rulers is difficult for any republic. Germany took 100 years to reach an agreement with the Hohenzollerns [the German imperial dynasty that was overthrown at the end of the first world war]. Nigeria took four to reach an agreement with the Oba of Benin. So, no reason to be snooty.” “The Europeans can’t tell us what we should or shouldn’t do with the objects of our heritage,” said Toyin Akinosho, co-founder of the nonprofit Committee for Relevant Art, which organises the Lagos Book and Arts festival. “Can’t we hold conversations here too about programming of new culture spaces?” MOWAA, meanwhile, has had to readjust. Originally supposed to be called the Edo Museum of West African Art, it decided to remove the name of the state to emphasise its impartiality. The Museum of West African Art. Photograph: Museum of West African Art (MOWAA) “We had hoped that we would be able to provide support to the restitution effort by demonstrating that we have institutions in West Africa that have what the west would regard as world-class display and storage facilities,” said Ihenacho. “But we never were set up to be the exclusive Benin bronzes museum.” One space will host an exhibition about the archaeological dig carried out on the MOWAA site with £3m in support from London’s British Museum, which still holds the largest single collection of looted Benin bronzes in the world. A selection of about 100 artefacts will hint at the story of the kingdom of Benin and its dissolution. “Some of them may well be made of bronze,” said Ihenacho. “But there will be nothing that was involved in the restitution process.”",https://www.theguardian.com/news/ng-interactive/2025/oct/12/restitution-row-how-nigerias-new-home-for-the-benin-bronzes-ended-up-with-clay-replicas,World,BBC,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/56783b4860feb61d9f83fc083031338246e9d58a/455_0_4561_3648/master/4561.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=04455f635e51cc58bf66385f4f349e35",2025-10-12T05:00:44+00:00,f85579a5d52887324ba6765d022e608bb424ce8a
72b17fd3ab1a,Cameroon’s 92-year-old president set for another term as country goes to polls,,"Cameroon goes to the polls on Sunday for a presidential election with Paul Biya, already the world’s oldest head of state at the age of 92, the favourite to win an eighth term in power in the central African country. A fractured opposition of 11 candidates is standing against Biya, who, despite his advanced age and declining health, has dismissed calls for him to retire. “Our candidate is in great shape ... and he is capable of continuing what he has started,” Grégoire Owona, the labour minister and the ruling party’s secretary general, told French radio RFI in late September. Many of the 7.8 million Cameroonians eligible to vote can remember no leader other than Biya, who has held on to the presidency with an iron fist since 1982. The vote is taking place against the backdrop of political stagnation, a cost of living crisis and social unrest. Opposition parties have accused the electoral commission, Elections Cameroon, of being subservient to the ruling party, and the most credible opposition candidate, Maurice Kamto, has had his candidacy barred by the courts. Other candidates include former ministers Issa Tchiroma Bakary, who recently defected from the presidential camp and has gathered several thousand people at meetings around the country, and Bello Bouba Maigari, who was Biya’s first prime minister in 1982. Observers say their individual campaigns lacked the cohesion necessary to mount a significant challenge to Biya’s long-standing rule. Cameroon faces significant socioeconomic challenges; a third of the population lives on less than $2 (£1.50) a day, youth unemployment is rampant, and many young people have expressed disillusionment with the electoral process, citing a lack of economic opportunities and political representation.

Photograph: Zohra Bensemra/Reuters Voter turnout has declined dramatically over the years, exacerbated by ongoing conflicts with jihadists in the Far North region and anglophone separatists in the west. The latter crisis, which began in 2017, has led to thousands of deaths in the country’s two English-speaking regions and forcibly displaced over 700,000 people. Kah Wallah, the leader of the Cameroon People’s party and founder of the Stand Up For Cameroon movement, said the anglophone crisis is one of the reasons why the movement has not supported elections since 2018. “We still believe it is unconscionable for the Biya regime to go to elections without ensuring the security of citizens in #NOSO,” she said, referring to a common abbreviation for Cameroon’s anglophone North-West and South-West regions. The government has been criticised for its heavy handed response, which has left many in the anglophone regions feeling marginalised and open to boycotting the vote. Biya, who is rarely seen in public, held his first and only campaign rally on Tuesday. Addressing a crowd of supporters at a stadium in the Far North town of Maroua, he promised to step up security in the region, curb youth unemployment, and improve road infrastructure and social amenities if reelected. “I am well aware of the problems that concern you, I know the unfulfilled expectations that make you doubt the future,” Biya said in his speech. “Based on my own experience, I can assure you that these problems are not insurmountable.” This year’s election cycle has featured striking appeals for him to step aside. First came the Catholic archbishop Samuel Kleda, who went on French radio last Christmas to say it was “not realistic” for Biya to keep doing the job. Then came the defections of Tchiroma and Maigari, both of whom openly challenged Biya’s fitness to lead. Finally, the president’s daughter Brenda Biya, 27, said on TikTok last month that her father “has made too many people suffer” and urged Cameroonians not to vote for him. She later recanted, but the post continues to circulate widely among Biya’s detractors. Theophile, an artist in the economic capital, Douala, called the vote a “scam”. The 24-year-old had hoped to vote for Kamto, who came second to Biya in the 2018 election. “As long as the system remains in place, there is nothing that can be done. There has to be a change,” he said.

42d7d08832c3,Madagascar’s prime minister calls for calm after elite soldiers join protests against president,,"Madagascar’s prime minister called for calm after an elite group of soldiers joined thousands of protesters against the country’s president on the streets of the capital on Saturday afternoon. Protesters marched alongside soldiers from the Capsat unit, who drove armoured vehicles, some waving Madagascar flags, from their base in Soanierana in the south of Antananarivo. A Capsat leader, Lylison René de Rolland, then addressed the cheering crowds in front of the city hall in 13 May Square, which protesters had previously been prevented from reaching. Capsat soldiers brought the current president, Andry Rajoelina, to power in a coup in 2009 . Speaking on state television on Saturday night, the prime minister, Ruphin Fortunat Zafisambo, said the government was “fully ready to listen and engage in dialogue with all factions – youth, unions or the military”. Rajoelina appointed Zafisambo and a new defence and security minister after dissolving the previous government last week in response to the protests. The soldiers’ intervention ratcheted up pressure on Rajoelina, who demonstrators have been demanding stand down. The youth-led protests broke out on 25 September, initially over water and electricity cuts. However, they quickly widened into calls for a complete overhaul of the political system, with the gen Z protesters not placated by Rajoelina firing his government last week. Earlier in the day, police fired stun grenades and teargas to try to disperse the protesters. The recently appointed minister of the armed forces also called on troops to “remain calm”, at a press conference on Saturday. “We call on our brothers who disagree with us to prioritise dialogue,” minister general Deramasinjaka Manantsoa Rakotoarivelo said. “The Malagasy army remains a mediator and constitutes the nation’s last line of defence.” However, a Capsat leader accompanied by a large group of soldiers called on other military units to “refuse orders to shoot your friends”, in a video that was posted on social media before they left their barracks. “Let us join forces, military, gendarmes and police, and refuse to be paid to shoot our friends, our brothers and our sisters,” he said, also calling on soldiers at the airport to “prevent all aircraft from taking off”. “Close the gates and await our instructions,” he said. “Do not obey orders from your superiors. Point your weapons at those who order you to fire on your comrades-in-arms, because they will not take care of our families if we die.” Nothing has been posted on the president’s social media accounts since Friday evening, when he was pictured meeting the heads of 10 of the country’s universities to discuss improving students’ lives. An activist who attended Saturday’s demonstrations said she was concerned about the involvement of Capsat, due to their role in the 2009 coup that brought Rajoelina to power. She also criticised politicians who made brief addresses to the crowds in front of the city hall as “opportunists”. “That’s why I’m not rejoicing at all, because all of those people gravitating around this ‘event’ are all dangerous,” said the activist, who didn’t want to be named for fear for her safety. A member of Gen Z Madagascar, a leaderless group of young people that has helped to coordinate the protests, also expressed doubts about what would happen next. “We are very happy, but a lot is happening [and] we don’t want another corrupted person to take the power here, so we will do everything to have the right to choose who to put up there,” he said.

85a5de3d976d,"Militia strikes kill at least 60 in Sudan displacement camp, says El Fasher group",,"Militia drone and artillery strikes have killed at least 60 people at a displacement shelter in the besieged city of El Fasher in western Sudan , a local activist group has said. The resistance committee for El Fasher said the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) paramilitary group hit the Dar al-Arqam displacement centre, which is in the grounds of a university. Bodies remained trapped in the rubble, the committee said in a statement, describing it as a “massacre” and calling on the international community to intervene. It said in a later statement that the shelter had been hit twice by drones and eight times by artillery shells on Friday and Saturday. Map showing drone strikes in Sudan “Children, women and the elderly were killed in cold blood, and many were completely burned,” said the committee, which is part of a group of activists who coordinate aid and document abuses in the conflict. “The situation has gone beyond disaster and genocide inside the city, and the world remains silent.” A separate medical group, called the Sudan Doctors’ Network, gave a figure of 53 people killed in the strikes, including 14 children and 15 women. The RSF has been fighting the Sudanese Armed Forces in a civil war since April 2023. Its militants have put El Fasher under siege for more than 500 days and families there are starving. El Fasher – home to 400,000 people – is the last state capital in the region of Darfur that has not been taken by the RSF. It has become a strategic front in the war as the paramilitaries attempt to consolidate control in the west. The UN has described the Sudan war as one of the worst humanitarian crises of the 21st century. More than 150,000 people have been killed and more than 14 million displaced. Nearly 25 million people have been forced into acute hunger. Countrywide fighting, fuelled by international powers , has raged in the absence of an effective global effort to end the bloodshed. On Friday, the UN high commissioner for human rights, Volker Türk, said he was “appalled by the RSF’s endless and wanton disregard for civilian life” in El Fasher. He said: “Despite repeated calls, including my own, for specific care to be taken to protect civilians, they continue instead to kill, injure and displace civilians, and to attack civilian objects, including [internally displaced people’s] shelters, hospitals and mosques, with total disregard for international law. This must end.” Sudan’s current conflict erupted in 2023, but is part of decades of violence. On Monday, the international criminal court took its first action against a suspect of crimes in Darfur when it convicted a leader of a militia for atrocities committed there more than 20 years ago. Ali Muhammad Ali Abd-al-Rahman, also known by the nom de guerre Ali Kushayb, was accused of being a leader of the Janjaweed militia, a group from which the RSF developed. The former Sudanese president Omar al-Bashir is also wanted by the ICC on genocide charges. Türk said the RSF, and all parties to the conflict, should “draw lessons from this week’s conviction of Ali Kushayb”.

290c18e54795,"In Venezuela’s ‘darkest hours’, will peace prize boost opposition or backfire?",,"I n March 2019 as a nationwide blackout plunged Venezuela into darkness, hundreds of citizens huddled on a basketball court in the city of Maracaibo to hear their leader promise to guide them out of the gloom. “We are, quite literally, living through our darkest hour. But these are also the brightest of times,” María Corina Machado told supporters as they used mobile phones to illuminate the night. Six and a half years later, on Friday Machado used almost identical words to celebrate winning the Nobel peace prize for her “extraordinary” – yet incomplete – struggle against Venezuela’s “brutal, authoritarian state” under the president, Nicolás Maduro. “We are … living the darkest hours. But at the same time there is enormous hope,” Machado declared after hearing the news, before vowing: “Venezuela will be free.” For all Machado’s relentless optimism, one question lingered after Friday’s surprise announcement in Oslo: this time, was she right? Would receiving the prestigious prize advance Machado’s tenacious campaign to unseat Maduro, or could it backfire and lead to greater repression from the autocrat’s feared security forces? International supporters voiced confidence that political change was coming for a country that has slipped into authoritarianism and economic malfunction since Maduro succeeded Hugo Chávez in 2013, with about 8 million citizens fleeing abroad. “The thirst for democracy always prevails,” wrote the European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen. Carlos Lizarralde, the author of a book about Venezuela’s collapse, said the prize would boost Machado by “cementing her position in the eyes of the international community … as the one credible opposition leader” in the South American country. “A Nobel laureate, in many ways, is the secular equivalent of a living saint. This perfectly complements her quasi-religious public image,” Lizarralde said of Machado, a devout Catholic who before going into hiding after last year’s rigged presidential election attended rallies clutching a rosary and wearing crosses around her neck. Others are more sceptical. David Smilde, a Tulane University Venezuela expert, said the prize would “definitely draw more international attention to the Venezuelan conflict and perhaps [create] more resolve” to end it. “But judging by past Nobel winners, it will not be fundamental,” Smilde added, noting how the 1994 prize shared by Yasser Arafat, Shimon Peres and Yitzhak Rabin did not fundamentally reconfigure the interests and forces involved in the Middle East conflict. Ronald Krebs, a political scientist who has studied the impact of Nobel peace prizes awarded in the hope of promoting political change in authoritarian countries, said his research showed they rarely succeeded. Krebs cited Liu Xiaobo , the Chinese poet and activist who received the prize in 2010 while in prison – a decision Beijing called an “anti-China farce” . Liu died seven years later, still in custody and with his homeland having become an even more repressive one-party state under its Communist party leader, Xi Jinping. In 2003, the Iranian activist Shirin Ebadi was honoured for her struggle for democracy and human rights . Krebs said becoming a laureate “insulated” Ebadi from persecution since Tehran feared jailing such a high-profile figure. “But it did absolutely nothing for those who were not similarly protected … if anything they were further repressed because of the Nobel peace prize,” he said. Krebs said peace prizes could inspire human rights defenders “to come forward with greater vigour”. “[But] at the same time it gives the repressive regime even more incentive to repress those who would seek to effect change. [So] it creates a really problematic and worrisome dynamic that … ultimately works to the detriment of those who are advocating for domestic political change … The road to hell is paved with good intentions.” Allies hope Machado’s prize will “bulletproof” her against regime reprisals. But Krebs said it was “extraordinarily doubtful” it would produce democratic change. Andrés Izarra, a former minister for Maduro’s mentor Chávez, was also doubtful, although he said Venezuela’s authoritarian president was facing the greatest challenge of his 12-year reign. Internationally isolated after being accused of stealing last year’s election from Machado’s ally Edmundo González, Maduro is also facing an unprecedented US pressure campaign that many suspect is aimed at forcing regime change. Since August, Donald Trump has ordered a major naval buildup off Venezuela’s Caribbean coast, with a series of deadly strikes on alleged Venezuelan drug smuggling boats. “There’s never been a clearer chance of displacing [Maduro] from power than now,” Izarra said. But the ex-minister dismissed the idea that Trump’s pressure campaign would “break” Maduro’s regime by sparking a military revolt. Izarra also doubted Trump would invade. “What you have in the Caribbean is a regime change operation … but it’s a performative one,” he said, designed to coerce Maduro into making concessions during secret talks Izarra believes are happening between US and Venezuelan officials. “This is all going to resolve itself at the negotiating table,” Izarra predicted. Maduro and his allies were “never going to surrender power voluntarily” but equally Trump would never alienate his anti-intervention Maga movement by putting boots on the ground. “They don’t want forever wars. They don’t want Vietnam. They don’t want Iraq,” Izarra said. Perhaps the only certainty is that Machado, a famously stubborn Margaret Thatcher-admiring conservative known as Venezuela’s “Iron Lady”, is unlikely to turn. “She’s a true fighter,” said Lizarralde, predicting Machado would battle on. “In her mind, this is an epic struggle between good and evil … and she [is convinced she] represents good.”",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/oct/12/venezuela-maria-corina-machado-nobel-peace-prize-boost-or-backfire,World,BBC,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dd04450904add5b134acf7ae76edf5d9f170e437/688_0_6880_5504/master/6880.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=9b739948ca45f0e9285606022bd3c670",2025-10-12T15:26:28+00:00,6d0df3710d1a9bd3c51ec0f7b189760165d08791
833045b71802,Venezuelan politician María Corina Machado wins Nobel peace prize,,"The Venezuelan opposition politician María Corina Machado has won the Nobel peace prize for her dogged struggle to rescue the South American country from its fate as “a brutal, authoritarian state”. Machado, 58, a conservative often described as Venezuela’s Iron Lady, has spent the last year living in hiding after her political movement was widely believed to have beaten the country’s president, Nicolás Maduro , in the July 2024 presidential election. Maduro refused to accept he had lost to Machado’s ally, the former diplomat Edmundo González, and launched a ferocious political crackdown that forced González into exile and Machado to go underground. In one of her last public appearances in Caracas, Machado said she was convinced Maduro’s days in power were numbered after his apparently stinging defeat. “I would say his departure is irreversible,” she told the Guardian . More than a year later Maduro remains in power and, crucially, has retained the support of Venezuela’s military and key international backers such as China and Russia. Donald Trump has ordered a major naval buildup off Venezuela’s Caribbean coast in recent weeks, which some suspect could be a prelude to some kind of regime change operation. Who is María Corina Machado,'Venezuela’s Iron Lady' and new Nobel peace prize winner? – video Machado reacted to her Nobel prize in a video that González posted on social media in which the pair celebrate the news. “I can’t believe it! My God!” an incredulous Machado tells her ally. “It’s fucking incredible!” replies González. The Norwegian Nobel Institute shared a video of the moment its director, Kristian Berg Harpviken, woke up Machado with the news. “Oh my God!” she said. “I have no words … But I hope you understand that … I am just one person, I certainly don’t deserve this.” “It caught her totally by surprise,” said Pedro Mario Burelli, an opposition politician and friend of more than four decades. “She’s very moved. She’s very concerned about what impact this has on the last phase of the struggle. She’s tearful,” he added, shortly after speaking to Machado on Friday morning. Writing on X, Machado dedicated the prize to “the suffering people of Venezuela and to President Trump for his decisive support of our cause!” She said the prize was “an impetus to conclude our task: to conquer freedom”. “We are on the threshold of victory and today more than ever we count on President Trump, the people of the United States, the peoples of Latin America, and the democratic nations of the world as our main allies to achieve freedom and democracy.” Machado in Caracas during the 2024 election campaign. Photograph: Alexandre Meneghini/Reuters The Nobel committee celebrated Machado’s long struggle for democracy in a statement that called her “one of the most extraordinary examples of civilian courage in Latin America in recent times”. It also paid tribute to the Venezuelan opposition’s “innovative and brave, peaceful and democratic” push for change during last year’s election, when hundreds of thousands of volunteers mobilised to observe the election and collect detailed tallies showing that González had won. “But the regime refused to accept the election result, and clung to power,” the committee said, painting a dire picture of life in Venezuela, which has gradually sunk into dictatorship since Maduro was democratically elected in 2013 after the death of his mentor, Hugo Chávez. “Venezuela has evolved from a relatively democratic and prosperous country to a brutal, authoritarian state that is now suffering a humanitarian and economic crisis,” the committee said. “Most Venezuelans live in deep poverty, even as the few at the top enrich themselves. The violent machinery of the state is directed against the country’s own citizens. Nearly 8 million people have left the country. The opposition has been systematically suppressed by means of election rigging, legal prosecution and imprisonment.” Machado, whom many Venezuelans know simply as MCM or María Corina, has been involved in politics for more than two decades and was a member of Venezuela’s national assembly from 2011 to 2014. She famously clashed with Chávez over Venezuela’s economic tribulations in 2012, earning the rebuke: “Eagles don’t hunt flies.” But it was in touring the economically devastated country by car and motorbike in the lead-up to the 2024 election that she cemented her reputation as Chavismo’s most effective and influential adversary. Her rallies drew huge, ecstatic crowds, with many supporters declaring an almost religious devotion to the charismatic Catholic politician, who promised to reunite millions of Venezuelan families separated by the mass migration triggered by Venezuela’s economic meltdown under Maduro. “She connected with people on the one issue that matters to people – which is family,” said Burelli, noting how Machado’s relatives had also been forced to flee abroad. “Everybody understands that she is in the same boat.” Machado addressing supporters at a protest in January. Photograph: Leonardo Fernández Viloria/Reuters Machado had originally hoped to run for president, but Venezuela’s pro-regime supreme court banned her from doing so, leaving González, a little-known former ambassador, to fill her shoes. “She will go down in history as the great opposition leader of our times … whether she makes it to the presidency or not,” said Carlos Lizarralde, the author of Venezuela’s Collapse: The Long Story of How Things Fell Apart​. The committee commended Machado as a “brave and committed champion of peace” who had kept “the flame of democracy burning during a growing darkness”. It also celebrated her as “a key, unifying figure in a political opposition that was once deeply divided”. For all her popular support, however, Machado is not universally liked. Some Venezuelans distrust her as a result of thinly veiled calls for a foreign military intervention to unseat Maduro in the past. She argued in 2019 that only a “a real, credible severe and imminent threat” of the use of international force would convince Maduro to leave power. David Smilde, a Tulane University Venezuela specialist, said: “María Corina Machado has shown incredible courage in fighting for democracy. In 2023-24 she heroically mobilised the Venezuelan population for presidential elections. However, much of her fight before then and since then has been through non-democratic means, seeking to generate international military intervention.” Others are suspicious of her ties to radical rightwing politicians such as Trump and Brazil’s former president Jair Bolsonaro, and her support for Trump’s widely discredited claim that a Venezuelan gang, the Tren de Aragua – has launched an “invasion” of the US. Trump and top officials such as Stephen Miller have used that spurious claim as justification for its campaign against Venezuelan migrants – scores of whom were deported to a high-security prison in authoritarian El Salvador – and for strikes on alleged “narco-boats” in the Caribbean that have killed at least 21 people. Maduro and his allies mockingly refer to Machado as “La Sayona” [“the sackcloth woman”] – the name of a hideous female ghost from Venezuelan folklore who roams the country taking violent revenge on unfaithful husbands. Christopher Sabatini, a senior research fellow on Latin America at Chatham House, said Maduro would be furious at the Nobel committee’s decision. “The question is, what now? Will it prompt public demonstrations in favour of María Corina Machado that [heap] some sort of public pressure on the government? Perhaps,” he said. “I think they would be hard-pressed to crack down with the international community [watching], but they did it in July 2024.” Burelli said he believed the award would shield his friend from possible arrest or persecution as she continued her fight for change. “This now truly protects her,” he said, arguing that the cost of targeting her would be “unbearable” for Maduro’s regime. “Now, I think she is bulletproof.”",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/oct/10/venezuelan-politician-maria-corina-machado-wins-nobel-peace-prize,World,BBC,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ba7f9656b4f477fad57a303c1cee53441417724e/312_0_3333_2667/master/3333.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=9270d4ec008427555972f81507219f9b",2025-10-10T14:59:33+00:00,dc7301c4a4e44c54b4fa8e9d0733e5e10d8fcbed

Boluarte refused to appear before Congress on Friday for an overnight hearing after a majority of lawmakers, including some once loyal to her, voted to initiate impeachment proceedings. They summoned Boluarte to appear before Congress at 11.30pm, but she skipped the proceedings that ended with 118 lawmakers voting for her impeachment. “The president’s impeachment has been approved,” announced the Congress leader, José Jerí, who took over the South American country’s presidency until April 2026 when elections are due to be held.

Protests have marked Boluarte’s presidency, along with various scandals , investigations and a rise in gang violence. She had already faced down several attempts to remove her from office. The latest effort cited her “permanent moral incapacity” to carry out her duties since assuming office in December 2022. Peru has had six presidents in about nine years. Boluarte, who took office after her predecessor, Pedro Castillo, was impeached over a crackdown on protests that killed at least 50 people, had seen her approval rating plummet.

b79fbd8e51af,President Petro accuses US of killing Colombians in attacks on ‘narco-boats’,,"Colombia’s president has drawn Washington’s ire after accusing the US of killing Colombian citizens during a recent boat strike in the Caribbean Sea. “A new theatre of war has opened up: the Caribbean,” Gustavo Petro wrote on his official X account on Wednesday night. The US has launched at least four deadly aerial attacks on alleged drug trafficking boats crossing the waterway since early September, when 11 people were killed in the first strike. The South American country’s leftwing leader claimed there were “indications” that the most recently destroyed boat was Colombian “and had Colombians onboard”. “I hope their families come forwards to report this,” added Petro, a fierce critic of Donald Trump, without offering further details or evidence. Since the US began its strikes in the Caribbean at least 21 people have reportedly lost their lives. On Friday, the US defense secretary, Pete Hegseth, said four “narco-terrorists” were killed in international waters “just off the coast of Venezuela” as they transported “substantial amounts of [US-bound] narcotics”. However, the names of those killed on the supposed “narco-boats” have not been released and Trump officials have failed to provide any proof that the victims were involved in smuggling drugs to the US. The White House pushed back against Petro’s claims, demanding he publicly retract “his baseless and reprehensible statement” about the boat attack. But two US officials, who were not authorised to discuss the matter publicly, told the New York Times that Colombians were on at least one of the boats recently destroyed by the US. Petro urged the White House to release the names of those killed by US strikes “so I can see if my information is unfounded”. Washington claims its strikes – which are part of a major military buildup in the Caribbean Sea – are part of a large-scale crackdown on Venezuelan narco groups it accuses of flooding the US with cocaine. However, the decision to deploy warships and thousands of marines off Venezuela’s Caribbean coast has left many observers many wondering if the operation is actually a pretext to depose Venezuela’s authoritarian president, Nicolás Maduro. “The deployment is vastly disproportionate to any real counter-narcotics mission. So this really looks, walks and talks like a regime change preparation,” Juan González, the White House’s former top Latin America official, told CNN this week. González, who served under Joe Biden, said that by some estimates “roughly 10% of naval assets” had been sent to the region. On Wednesday, Maduro, who Trump failed to topple during his first term, warned that his troops were preparing for a possible attempt at regime change. “If the gringos attack, we will respond.” Venezuela’s defense minister, Vladimir Padrino López, said he was braced for a variety of scenarios including drone attacks, an air campaign or acts of sabotage or targeted assassinations carried out by US special forces. Writing on Wednesday, Petro claimed “the war” playing out in the Caribbean Sea was not about drug smuggling but oil, a commodity of which Venezuela boasts the world’s largest reserves. “The world must stop this,” Petro added. “This aggression is aimed at the whole of Latin America and the Caribbean.” On Thursday, Grenada’s ministry of foreign affairs confirmed it ha​d received a request from the US for the “temporary installation of radar equipment and associated technical personnel”. The confirmation followed days of speculation by local media that the US was going to ask the country to host military assets to help with their operations in the southern Caribbean. While some Caribbean nations, such as Trinidad and Tobago, have welcomed the US’s military presence in the region, others have described it as a threat to peace and security. The Venezuela-backed Bolivarian Alliance for the Peoples of Our America trade bloc, of which Grenada is a member, had condemned the US deployment of warships as a “flagrant violation” of international law. In its statement, Grenada said it was carefully reviewing the request and would only make a decision after “technical and legal assessments”.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/oct/09/gustavo-petro-colombia-boats-us-military,World,BBC,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/488b1068a4859286fa00a06f1f29b1bee22011c1/0_0_1500_1200/master/1500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=96fffc94179e9c3ff73d6148fa134c97",2025-10-09T21:28:51+00:00,78c1c31d0171763b3ed4ea6ffbdbba298a7012e8
d3e751bd2764,Cristina Fernández de Kirchner: Argentinian court sentences man to 10 years for attempted assassination,,"A court in Argentina has sentenced a man to 10 years in prison after finding him guilty of attempting to kill former president Cristina Fernández de Kirchner . The court in Buenos Aires also sentenced the man’s accomplice to eight years in prison, capping a dramatic case that has captivated the country since 2022, when the main defendant, Fernando Sabag Montiel, squeezed through a crowd outside the ex-president’s home, thrust a loaded gun at her face and pulled the trigger. The gun did not go off. Fernández de Kirchner, Argentina’s vice-president at the time, was unharmed. The botched assassination attempt provoked street protests from Fernández de Kirchner’s diehard supporters as well as scepticism and conspiracy theories from her fervent critics. Man points gun at Argentinian vice-president Cristina Fernández de Kirchner – video Among Latin America’s best-known politicians with three decades at the forefront of Argentinian politics and two terms as president from 2007 to 2015, Fernández de Kirchner is a deeply polarising figure whose brand of leftwing populism brought Argentina infamy for its runaway inflation and enormous fiscal deficits. Convicted of corruption for allegedly steering public roadworks contracts to a friend’s company, Fernández de Kirchner, 72, was sentenced earlier this year to six years in prison. Citing her age and safety fears since the 2022 attack, a court allowed her to serve her time under house arrest in Buenos Aires. While banned from running for public office, she remains outspoken against Argentina’s libertarian president, Javier Milei. From her apartment, she still posts diatribes on social media, waves at supporters gathered below her balcony and receives high-profile visitors, such as the Brazilian president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, who visited her in July . Fernández de Kirchner has long rejected the corruption charges as politically motivated. Fernando Sabag Montiel confessed to the crime in court, describing his assassination attempt as a means to exact justice for Fernández de Kirchner’s alleged corruption. Photograph: Luis Robayo/AFP/Getty Images In the trial that concluded Wednesday, prosecutors aimed to prove that Sabag Montiel, an Argentinian citizen born in Brazil, and his then girlfriend, Brenda Uliarte, planned the assassination attempt in advance. The prosecution produced WhatsApp chats about the firearm and evidence that the former couple visited Fernández de Kirchner’s house before the attack to observe her routines and security. At the time of the shooting, Fernández de Kirchner was standing trial for corruption and crowds rallied regularly outside her home in solidarity.

8de7c3bd4b88,China warns US of retaliation over Trump’s 100% tariffs threat,,"Beijing has told the US it will retaliate if Donald Trump fails to back down on his threat to impose 100% tariffs on Chinese imports as investors brace for another bout of trade war turmoil. China’s commerce ministry blamed Washington for raising trade tensions between the two countries after Trump announced on Friday that he would impose the additional tariffs on China’s exports to the US , along with new controls on critical software, by 1 November . “Wilful threats of high tariffs are not the right way to get along with China ,” a spokesperson for the commerce ministry said on Sunday, according to the state news agency Xinhua. “China’s position on the trade war is consistent. We do not want it, but we are not afraid of it. “If the United States insists on going the wrong way, China will surely take resolute measures to protect its legitimate rights and interests.” Trump and senior US administration officials opened a door to a China trade deal on Sunday as market futures showed another US stock market drop. “Don’t worry about China, it will all be fine! Highly respected President Xi just had a bad moment. He doesn’t want Depression for his country, and neither do I. The U.S.A. wants to help China, not hurt it!!!” Trump wrote on Truth Social. The message came after JD Vance called on Beijing to “choose the path of reason” in the latest spiralling trade fight between the world’s two leading economies that has shaken stock markets. Dow futures showed a drop of 887 points ahead of the stock markets’ open on Monday. The index dropped sharply lower on Friday after reignited fears of a trade war with China when threatened to impose 100% tariffs on Chinese imports after China said it would restrict rare earth exports. The Dow fell 879 points, or 1.9%. “It’s going to be a delicate dance, and a lot of it is going to depend on how the Chinese respond,” Vance said on Fox News’s Sunday Morning Futures. “If they respond in a highly aggressive manner, I guarantee you, the president of the United States has far more cards than the People’s Republic of China. If, however, they’re willing to be reasonable,” he said, then the US would, too. The US president shocked the financial markets on Friday when he accused China of “very hostile” moves to restrict exports of rare-earth materials needed by US industry. It prompted heavy falls on Wall Street, where about $2tn (£1.5tn) was wiped off the value of the US stocks. China insisted on Sunday that its latest export controls on rare earths such as holmium, erbium, thulium, europium and ytterbium were legitimate. “China’s export controls are not export bans,” said the commerce ministry spokesperson. “All applications of compliant export for civil use can get approval, so that relevant businesses have no need to worry.” skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Business Today Get set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morning Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The UK’s FTSE 100 share index fell almost 1% on Friday as Trump’s threat sparked a late selloff. The futures market indicates there could be further losses in London and New York on Monday, although there could also be relief that Beijing has not yet retaliated. Bitcoin, which had tumbled 8% after Trump’s post on Truth Social, rose by 1.5% on Sunday after China refrained from retaliating. Trump’s tariff threat was “a rather unwelcome development for financial markets” as investors had “by and large moved on from the trade and tariff story”, said Michael Brown, a senior research strategist at the brokerage firm Pepperstone. “Chiefly, the question that every man and his dog are attempting to answer is whether this is a credible threat, that the Trump admin might follow through on, or whether this is another example of the ‘escalate to de-escalate’ strategy that Trump used so frequently earlier in the year. “A strategy where outlandish and ridiculous tariff figures are threatened, in an attempt to focus minds, extract concessions from the other party, and ultimately come to agreement faster than otherwise might’ve been possible.”",https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/12/china-warns-us-of-retaliation-over-trump-100-tariffs-threat,World,BBC,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cb43890e4f4ab51bed15cbbe23a8f5bf55c25672/937_0_2878_2304/master/2878.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=4b2c272e0a0a17725a46272bc924c31c",2025-10-12T13:35:27+00:00,2eb0b317e14c50e3caef0afffd4de654a999f70a
4fd9c6a0f206,Trump threatens 100% China tariffs as Beijing restricts rare-earth exports,,"Donald Trump has threatened to impose additional US tariffs of 100% on China starting next month, accusing Beijing of “very hostile” moves to restrict exports of rare earths needed for American industry. Wall Street fell sharply after the US president reignited public tensions with the Chinese government, and raised the prospect of another acrimonious trade war between the world’s two largest economies. Over the summer, relations had improved between Washington and Beijing , and Trump agreed to drastically reduce steep tariffs he imposed on China earlier this year, following negotiations between the two countries. Late on Friday, however, the president threatened to ratchet them back up by imposing a 100% tariff on goods from China “over and above” any existing tariffs. This would happen on 1 November “or sooner”, he said, hinting that the move could be accelerated should Chinese officials opt to retaliate. The US will also introduce export controls on “any and all critical software”, he added. “I never thought it would come to this but perhaps, as with all things, the time has come,” Trump wrote on his Truth Social website, claiming: “Ultimately, though potentially painful, it will be a very good thing, in the end, for the USA. “One of the Policies that we are calculating at this moment is a massive increase of Tariffs on Chinese products coming into the United States of America. There are many other countermeasures that are, likewise, under serious consideration.” A planned meeting between Trump and Xi Jinping in South Korea later this month may no longer happen, Trump suggested, saying “there seems to be no reason” to meet with the Chinese president. The US president’s threat sets the stage for another escalation in his volatile dispute with China. Just four months ago, he described US relations with the country as “excellent” after signing off on a tariff reduction deal . Trump repeatedly hiked US tariffs on Chinese goods in the spring, amid spiraling tensions between the two countries, to a peak of 145%. Beijing hit back, raising its own tariffs on US exports to 125%. But talks between officials, amid widespread concern over the impact of such exorbitant duties on the world economy, led to a fragile detente. US tariffs on Chinese products fell to 30%, while Chinese tariffs on US goods dropped to 10%. The president’s latest online attack on Beijing alarmed investors on Friday. The benchmark S&P 500 fell 2.7%, suffering its worst day since April, and the Dow Jones industrial average retreated 1.9% in New York, while the technology-focused Nasdaq Composite sank 3.6%. Shares in the tech giant Nvidia – the world’s biggest public company, with a market value of almost $2.5tn – were hit particularly hard, dropping almost 5%. Other leading global markets also came under pressure. The FTSE 100 dropped 0.9% in London. China is the world’s largest producer of rare earths, producing more than 90% of the world’s processed rare earths and rare-earth magnets. The 17 elements are critical for manufacturers of everything from electric cars to plane engines. Earlier this week, Beijing significantly expanded its export controls over rare earths, adding five new materials to its control list. Its last expansion of controls, back in April, prompted supply shortages around the world before a series of diplomatic deals helped resolve some of the issues. “I have always felt that they’ve been lying in wait, and now, as usual, I have been proven right!” Trump claimed on Friday. “There is no way that China should be allowed to hold the World ‘captive,’ but that seems to have been their plan for quite some time, starting with the ‘Magnets’ and, other Elements that they have quietly amassed into somewhat of a Monopoly position, a rather sinister and hostile move, to say the least. “But the US has Monopoly positions also, much stronger and more far reaching than China’s.” Trump’s aggressive tariff strategy is a key pillar of his policy agenda. He has claimed higher taxes on imports from across the world will strengthen the US economy and raise trillions of dollars for the federal government. But tariffs are also often passed on to consumers, leading to higher prices. After years of heightened inflation, Trump has repeatedly claimed there now is none in the US. In reality, price growth has been rising .",https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/10/trump-china-tariffs,World,BBC,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8e482f0db7c72148b29a33d4261daad28a938ca0/340_0_3407_2725/master/3407.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=d5b201594192da6421c36515fe04051d",2025-10-10T21:11:36+00:00,4c2d2afc1b1299393d817cee7f5b8112d115603b
1c9d0d289385,Seven people killed after twin earthquakes off coast of Philippines,,"Two powerful offshore earthquakes struck off the coast of the southern Philippines on Friday, killing at least seven people, while towns near the epicentre faced structural damage and authorities warned of strong aftershocks. The first quake of magnitude 7.4, in waters off the town of Manay in the province of Davao Oriental, triggered a tsunami alert for coasts within 186 miles (300km) of the epicentre, but the warnings for the Philippines and Indonesia were subsequently lifted. A second earthquake of magnitude 6.8 struck the same area seven hours later, triggering another tsunami warning, with the country’s seismology agency, Phivolcs, warning of possible waves that could be more than 1 metre (3.2ft) higher than normal tides. People living near coastal areas in the southern Philippines were “strongly advised to immediately evacuate” to higher ground, or move further inland, Phivolcs said. The director of the agency, Teresito Bacolcol, described the twin earthquakes as a doublet – two distinct earthquakes that occurred along a massive trench off the country’s eastern seaboard. There were initial reports of damage to homes, buildings and bridges, one official in Manay said, although the full extent of the damage in the Philippines was not immediately clear. At least seven people were killed, a civil defence official, Ednar Dayanghirang, said in a briefing. The deaths were reported in towns and cities near the earthquake’s epicentre. Footage shared on social media after the first quake showed students fleeing in panic from their classrooms, radio anchors leaving their seats mid-air and people crouching and bracing themselves on all fours as the ground shook violently. Motorcycles were knocked over by the force of the tremor. map The governor of Davao Oriental said people panicked when the first earthquake struck. “Some buildings were reported to have been damaged,” Edwin Jubahib told the broadcaster DZMM. “It was very strong.” Evacuation orders were issued in affected areas, with schools suspending classes for the day. Damage to infrastructure, including cracks in the structure of the Magsaysay Bridge in Butuan city, were reported. Ferdinand Marcos Jr, the Philippine president, said authorities were assessing the extent of the damage and search and rescue efforts being prepared. “We are working round the clock to ensure that help reaches everyone who needs it,” Marcos said. The energy secretary, Sharon Garin, said officials were monitoring four electric companies in Mindanao after power supply in some areas tripped. It was not immediately clear whether the shutdowns were caused by the earthquake or were a precautionary measure. Students are evacuated in Mindanao after the powerful earthquake. Photograph: Golden Cornucopia - Davao de Oro State College/AFP/Getty Images Christine Sierte, a teacher in the town of Compostela, near Manay, told Agence France-Presse she was in an online meeting when the violent shaking started. “It was very slow at first then it got stronger … That’s the longest time of my life. We weren’t able to walk out of the building immediately because the shaking was so strong,” she said. “The ceilings of some offices fell, but luckily no one was injured.” She said some of the school’s 1,000 students “suffered panic attacks and difficulty in breathing”. Kath Cortez, a journalist based in Davao city, said the ground floor walls of her family’s house were showing small cracks. “I was surprised by the strength,” she said, adding members of her family ran out of the house. The quakes hit just 10 days after a deadly 6.9-magnitude earthquake hit Bogo City in Cebu province, which killed 71 people. Aftershocks are still being felt in the area. Neighbouring Indonesia also issued an earlier tsunami warning for its regions of North Sulawesi and Papua, according to its geophysics agency. The Philippines sits on the Pacific ring of fire and experiences more than 800 quakes each year.

ec07610592a1,US farmers caught in Trump-China trade war – who’ll buy the soybeans?,,"At the Purfeerst farm in southern Minnesota , the soybean harvest just wrapped up for the season. The silver grain bins are full of about 100,000 bushels of soybeans, which grab about $10 a piece. This year, though, the fate of the soybeans, and the people whose livelihoods depend on selling them, is up in the air: America’s soybean farmers are stuck in the middle of a trade war between the US and China , the biggest purchaser of soybean exports, used to feed China’s pigs. “We are gonna have to find a home for them soybeans some time soon,” said Matt Purfeerst, a fifth-generation farmer on the family’s land. “They won’t stay in our bins for ever.” No other country comes close to purchasing as many American soybeans as China – last year, it was more than $12bn worth. This year, the country has not purchased a single dollar’s worth, cutting off the country that makes up about half of US soybean exports. While Trump has said he intends some sort of payment to go to soybean farmers hurt by tariffs, an announcement of a specific plan is on hold while the government is shut down. He said in a Truth Social post last week that he would be meeting with the Chinese president soon and “soybeans will be a major topic of discussion”. The White House cast blame on Democrats for the government shutdown for the delay in a response to the Guardian on Wednesday, erroneously claiming they were prioritizing healthcare for migrants over farmers. Soybeans are planted near Waverly, Minnesota. Photograph: Mark Vancleave/AP “President Trump, [Treasury] Secretary [Scott] Bessent, and [Agriculture] Secretary [Brooke] Rollins are always in touch about the needs of our farmers, who played a crucial role in the president’s November victory,” spokeswoman Anna Kelly said. “Unfortunately, Democrats in Congress have stalled progress on this issue with their prolonged shutdown to serve illegal immigrants instead of America’s farmers. No decisions have been made, but we look forward to sharing good news soon.” Purfeerst’s family farm grows soybeans and corn, and has some beef cattle. The job is a round-the-clock combination of engineering, business, manual labor, environmental science. And it’s increasingly hard for family farms to make it. Costs for propane, fertilizer and seed have gone up, he said, and the prices for the goods they are selling don’t make up for the increased costs. Soybean farmers have become the “poster child out there right now of how this one particular segment’s getting hurt”, he said. The farm recently welcomed the Democratic US senator Amy Klobuchar for a visit to talk about how the tariffs were playing out, but Purfeerst said political affiliations didn’t matter. “Only 1% of the population is even involved in [agriculture] any more,” he said. “And what gets really challenging is this perception of ag out there, whether it’s on tariffs and prices or environmental issues, farmers kind of seem to be the crosshairs of a lot of it.” Farming areas voted for Trump in 2024, as did much of rural America. One analysis, by Investigate Midwest , showed Trump growing his support among farming-dependent counties in 2024 despite a trade war during his first term that negatively affected farmers. “I’m not gonna get into who I voted for particularly, but I would just have to say, at the time, you got to make decisions who you think is going to be the best leader of the country, and go on with life,” Purfeerst said. “And in four years, you get to vote again. That’s the beauty of our society. It’s not an 80-year regime. It’s a four-year cycle. It’s hard to say what’s gonna come about. I mean, everyone’s got their pros and cons.” A soybean harvest at a farm outside St Peter, Minnesota, last month. Photograph: Bloomberg/Getty Images Purfeerst has options for his soybeans: because of his farm’s location, he can sell domestically to soybean crush facilities in nearby towns, sell on the rail market, or sell in Minneapolis and put product on barges down the Mississippi River. Other soybean farmers, especially those in more remote parts of the midwest where soybeans are mostly produced, aren’t as lucky. Stories from all parts of the country where soybeans are grown have surfaced in recent weeks – in Arkansas, Illinois, Nebraska, Indiana, the Dakotas. Farmers face higher costs for inputs like fertilizer and equipment. They rely on China as a purchaser. Soybeans sitting in bins too long is subject to weather and pests. The prices fluctuate, so it’s a gamble to hold on to it that sometimes can pay off, or sometimes lose money. “Let’s say tomorrow we get a trade deal with China, and it’s favorable to soybeans. All of a sudden you might see this market jump from $10 to $12 in three, four days,” Purfeerst said. “So it makes it extremely challenging from a risk management standpoint of: when do you market your crop, and how many eggs do you put in that basket? The potential is $12, but if we don’t get a trade deal, it could go to $9 … There’s a huge volatility in soybeans.” The soybean industry has been warning for months that China’s exit from the market would be devastating, calling on the Trump administration to come up with a trade deal that spares farmers. The American Soybean Association wrote a letter to Trump in August, saying the country’s soybean farmers were “standing at a trade and financial precipice” and “cannot survive a prolonged trade dispute with our largest customer”. Tim Walz, Minnesota’s Democratic governor, declared the first week of October as soybean week, saying in the announcement that “our soybean farmers are confronting a crisis they haven’t seen since the 1980s”. “They’ve produced a bumper crop this year, just to find out they have nowhere to sell their harvest thanks to Trump’s trade policies,” Walz said. “Minnesota’s got the best beans in the world – I encourage Minnesotans to stand with our farmers and continue to advocate for federal trade reform.” It’s not the first time a Trump trade plan has hurt soybean farmers: in 2018, a trade war led to significant reductions in soybean exports to China. Since then, the market has rebounded, though China has ramped up soybean purchases from Brazil and Argentina, stockpiling imports earlier this year. Republican lawmakers have said they are sympathetic to the farmers and want to find a way to help them. James Comer, a Republican congressman from Kentucky, said this week that soybean farmers were not to blame for the problem they are facing. “They planted that crop assuming that those foreign markets were going to be there,” Comer said in a recent TV appearance . “I think we need to do something to help the soybean farmers.” A bailout is “really just a Band-Aid”, though it’s one that many farmers would welcome as they are getting squeezed right now, Purfeerst said. Most farmers would prefer an open market, without tariffs, for their products, letting the market dictate prices. They don’t want the trade war now to affect a long-term relationship that makes up a significant chunk of market share. There also should be more emphasis put on increasing domestic uses of soybeans, though a long-range plan like that won’t help the farmers who are stuck right now, he said. “There’s farms that are struggling to make money on soybean acres, and you’ve got to remember: whatever payment we’re getting, whatever that dollar amount might be, if we get anything, it’s not just going in our back pocket,” he said. “We’ve got a fertilizer bill. We’ve got to pay the seed bill. There’s a lot of payments. So really, that money might be in the farmer’s hands for a month, until it gets spent on inputs for next year.”",https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/10/trump-china-trade-war-soybeans,World,BBC,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9dc2e1a8ba0221eddd184d4216612d2e4e47a7b9/270_0_2700_2160/master/2700.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=61131a5b4de48b7f681b7bfd62427652",2025-10-10T12:00:52+00:00,8edf0dba1d9a178603345e062f13baaa1bc71c71

6b7bad4583cd,"Australia’s household energy bills will halve by 2050, modelling suggests",,"Australian household energy bills will halve by 2050 as solar panels, batteries and electric cars and appliances become the norm, reducing pressure on the federal government over living costs and creating room for more climate action, a thinktank study suggests. Modelling by the Grattan Institute finds that cutting greenhouse gas emissions from electricity generation in line with the goal of reaching net zero emissions by 2050 will cut average household energy costs from about $5,800 today to about $3,000. The report says a fall of roughly this magnitude will happen under existing policies as households use less gas and petrol and more clean energy. The biggest savings are expected in gas-reliant Victoria , where the modelling suggests average annual spending on petrol, gas and electricity could fall from $6,036 to $2,767. The report says emission cuts in the power sector are not happening fast enough and the mid-century net zero target will not be met without a policy requiring cuts in pollution from electricity. The Grattan Institute has called on the government to consider expanding a policy applied to major industrial polluting sites – the safeguard mechanism – to include power plants. It says this would limit household energy savings compared with what would otherwise happen, but only marginally – by about 3%. It says the safeguard mechanism is already a form of carbon pricing – language the Labor government has avoided since it lost a fraught political fight that culminated with the Coalition government under Tony Abbott abolishing a functioning carbon pricing scheme in 2014. The institute’s energy and climate change program director, Alison Reeve, said how people use energy has changed since then “and the politics of carbon pricing should change too”. “For too long, federal governments of both political colours have avoided pricing carbon because they fear higher electricity prices,” Reeve said. “Our report shows that the source of that fear is becoming outdated.” The Coalition introduced the safeguard mechanism and Labor revamped it in 2023. It requires about 200 industrial facilities that release more than 100,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide in Australia each year – including liquified natural gas plants, coalmines, smelters and factories – to reduce emission intensity by 4.9% each year until 2030. The cuts can be made either on site or by buying carbon offsets. Companies that reduce emissions below a baseline level are also given “safeguard mechanism credits” that they can sell to polluters that do not meet their baseline. Government data suggests the total direct pollution from facilities covered by the safeguard mechanism fell by nearly 2% in the first year after Labor’s revamp. But the scheme has been criticised for allowing unlimited use of offsets despite peer-reviewed studies suggesting they are failing to deliver what was promised . A review of the safeguard mechanism is planned next year. Reeve said the institute’s modelling assumed electricity companies would make direct emission cuts, and could not rely Australian carbon credits created through methods including improved nature cover. skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Clear Air Australia Adam Morton brings you incisive analysis about the politics and impact of the climate crisis Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Renewable energy in homes has boomed since the introduction of a battery subsidy in July. But investment in large-scale developments – particularly windfarms – has slowed, in part due to delays in planning approvals, construction of transmission links and supply chains. The federal climate change and energy minister, Chris Bowen, said the government was focused on delivering existing policies, including an underwriting program for large solar, wind and battery developments (known as the capacity investment scheme), the $20bn “rewiring the nation” program and the battery subsidy. He said it was “looking at a range of post-2030 settings” but had no plans to include electricity in the safeguard mechanism.

22cbc72e8e10,Thousands attend pro-Palestine rallies across Australia as organisers vow to keep protesting after Gaza ceasefire,,"Tens of thousands of people have rallied across Australia at pro-Palestine demonstrations, with organisers vowing to continue protesting after Donald Trump brokered a ceasefire deal in Gaza that initially appeared to be holding . In Sydney, the Palestine Action Group said 30,000 people had marched from Hyde Park to Belmore Park in the central business district after a planned rally to the Opera House was prohibited by the New South Wales court of appeal last week. NSW police estimated 8,000 people attended the Sydney protest, with a spokesperson saying there had been “no significant incidents”. Rallies were also held in Melbourne, Brisbane and Perth on Sunday to mark two years of killing in Gaza after Hamas attacks on 7 October 2023 killed about 1,200 people in Israel. The Palestine Action Group organiser Josh Lees told Guardian Australia at Sunday’s rally: “In terms of the movement, we’ll absolutely continue to protest for a free Palestine … for self-determination in Gaza, for aid to be allowed in and for Palestinians to be able to rebuild Gaza.” Sign up: AU Breaking News email But fellow organiser Amal Naser said that next week the organisation would be among groups attending a Unite Against Racism rally in Belmore Park in response to anti-immigration rallies and the presence of neo-Nazis in Australia. Many protesters expressed hope that the ceasefire would lead to lasting peace. Others were sceptical of Trump’s involvement and urged supporters to keep pressuring the Australian government to sanction Israel and end the trade in military goods . Pro-Palestine demonstrators marched in Melbourne. Photograph: Anadolu/Getty Images Shamikh Badra, a Palestinian Australian living in Sydney, said he hoped the agreement would allow him to bring his elderly mother, who is still in Gaza without access to medical care, to Australia, and to find and bury his brother, sister-in-law and their four children, who have been missing since 2023 . “We support the efforts to end the genocide but still, I’m worried … the Trump plan [was] imposed on Palestinians,” he said. “They didn’t consult Palestinians at the beginning.” Separately, thousands attended a Jewish community commemoration on Sunday night in Sydney’s eastern suburbs to mark the second anniversary of 7 October. Geoffrey Majzner, the brother of Galit Carbone, an Australian citizen who was killed during the attacks, was scheduled to speak. There were prayers for the imminent repatriation of 20 remaining hostages in Gaza and those killed on 7 October. The Israeli ambassador, Amir Maimon, paid tribute to the resolve of survivors. The crowd booed when he mentioned the Australian prime minister, Anthony Albanese, and the foreign minister, Penny Wong. Members of the Jewish community gathered in Sydney on Sunday night.

The NSW police assistant commissioner Peter McKenna told the court of appeal last week the plan had “disaster written all over it” .

a0894ff1ad81,Australian Madeleine Habib released from Israeli jail after aid flotilla intercepted en route to Gaza,,"Australian woman Madeleine Habib has been released from an Israeli prison, four days after a ship she captained as part of another Gaza-bound aid flotilla was intercepted by the Israeli military in international waters. A source close to Habib said she was released on Sunday morning Israel time, along with other activists from the freedom flotilla, and taken to the Jordan border. Habib is the eighth Australian who travelled on a humanitarian flotilla to be detained by Israeli authorities and subsequently released. Sign up: AU Breaking News email The experienced mariner and long-time humanitarian activist was arrested on 8 October and detained in Israel’s Ketziot prison for allegedly “illegally seeking to break Israel’s naval blockade on Gaza”. Australian consular officials who visited Habib in jail the following day were told she could remain in Israel “indefinitely” unless she agreed to sign a waiver. Habib had refused to sign the document. Guardian Australia understands the waiver required detainees to acknowledge they had sought to illegally break Israel’s naval blockade on Gaza. It was not known on Sunday if Habib signed the waiver before being released. Previously, at least one flotilla member who did not sign was nevertheless released, sources have said. Habib previously told Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (Dfat) officials who visited that she had experienced “degradation but no physical abuse” in custody. Habib said she had been provided access to her lawyer but had eaten only “stale bread” and drank “brown” tap water. The high-security prison in the Negev desert where she was held is known for its detention of Palestinian security prisoners – many of whom Israel accuses of involvement in militant or terrorist activities. A Dfat spokesperson earlier on Sunday said it had raised the treatment and welfare of Australians detained in Israel with Israeli officials in Tel Aviv and Canberra. “We understand that people want to help deliver aid to those suffering in Gaza – we also want to see critical aid delivered,” the spokesperson said. skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Breaking News Australia Get the most important news as it breaks Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

a1d3a5415cf3,Hackers leak Qantas data containing 5 million customer records after ransom deadline passes,,"Hackers say they have leaked the personal records of 5 million Qantas customers on the dark web, after a ransom deadline set by the cybercriminals passed. The airline is one of more than 40 firms globally caught up in the hack, reported to contain up to 1bn customer records. The hacker collective Scattered Lapsus$ Hunters released an extortion note on a data leaks site on the dark web last week, demanding payment in return for preventing the stolen data from being shared. The Qantas data, which was stolen from a Salesforce database in a major cyber-attack in June , included customers’ email addresses, phone numbers, birth dates and frequent flyer numbers. It did not contain credit card details, financial information or passport details. On Saturday the group marked the data as “leaked”, writing: “Don’t be the next headline, should have paid the ransom.” Sign up: AU Breaking News email Jeremy Kirk, analyst at Intel 471, a cyber threat intelligence company, said 44 companies had been included in the leak including Gap, Vietnam Airlines, Toyota, Disney, McDonald’s, Ikea, and Adidas. He said the hacker group was well known and operated out of countries such as the US, UK and Australia. “This particular group is not a new threat; they’ve been around for some time,” Kirk said. “But they’re very skilled in knowing how companies have connected different systems together.” A Qantas spokesperson previously told Guardian Australia its priorities were “continued vigilance and providing ongoing support for our customers” after the June attack. “We continue to offer a 24/7 support line and specialist identity protection advice to affected customers,” the spokesperson said. A Salesforce spokesperson told Guardian Australia the company “will not engage, negotiate with, or pay any extortion demand”. There was no indication the Salesforce platform had been compromised, the company said via a statement. “We are aware of recent extortion attempts by threat actors, which we have investigated in partnership with external experts and authorities. Our findings indicate these attempts relate to past or unsubstantiated incidents, and we remain engaged with affected customers to provide support,” it said. It is understood that the other global data was stolen between April 2024 and September 2025 and included personal and contact information of the companies’ customers and employees, including dates of birth, purchase histories and passport numbers. “No company wants to see hundreds of thousands, or millions, of records of their customers just on the internet,” Kirk said. “That’s awful. It’s awful for the companies. It’s awful for the people affected.” In July, Qantas obtained an ongoing injunction from the NSW supreme court ensuring protections to prevent the stolen data being accessed, viewed, released, used, transmitted or published by anyone, including third parties. Kirk said there was no financial data but criminals could potentially use leaked personal information to open credit cards. He said people should monitor their accounts for suspicious activity, and beware of scam emails that are personalised. “These days, a lot of threat groups are now generating personalised phishing emails,” he said. “They’re getting better and better at this – and these types of breaches help sort of fuel that economy, that underground fraudster economy.” Qantas said on Sunday: “With the help of specialist cyber security experts, we are investigating what data was part of the release.” “We have also put in place additional security measures, increased training across our teams and strengthened system monitoring and detection since the [mid-year] incident occurred,” a spokesperson said.",https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/oct/11/hackers-leak-qantas-data-containing-5-million-customer-records-after-ransom-deadline-passes,World,BBC,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/39f8843188c9b9c5d36605e65609209817ba4109/1035_0_7857_6286/master/7857.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=2d866c0f2753e57a6a5889ccdd1574d1",2025-10-11T05:03:52+00:00,cebc47b9779cc041d8e6d95bf89fe7ede120fda1
f3c4ddad5b94,European far right follows Trump in calling for antifa to be declared terrorists,,"Where Donald Trump leads, Europe’s nationalists and far right follow. After a Truth Social post last month, when Trump announced the US would designate antifa , the decentralised anti-fascist movement, “a major terrorist organisation” , his international allies swung into action. That same day, the Dutch parliament, where the largest party is Geert Wilders’ far-right PVV, passed a resolution, noting the US decision and calling on the government to declare antifa a terrorist organisation in the Netherlands . Then the Hungarian prime minister, Viktor Orbán – more usually a source of inspiration for Trump – said his country would follow suit. Next, in the European parliament, a far-right MEP from the Flemish nationalist Vlaams Belang party drafted a resolution with the same request. Tom Vandendriessche announced last week that 79 MEPs from 20 countries supported his proposed text. In a video posted on X with ominous music playing, he described antifa as “an international network that is supported, financed and protected by the system to fight the nationalist opposition with violence”. Experts characterise antifa rather differently, instead describing it as a loose identity movement with neither leaders nor membership structure. While it has origins in Europe , it gained attention in the US after Trump’s election in 2016. “Antifa is not what I would call an identifiable group or organisation [but] a movement, perhaps,” Jessica White, acting director of terrorism and conflict studies at the Royal United Services Institute, told the Guardian. “On the basis of that lack of clear definition, I think it’s very challenging, if not counterproductive, to try and designate it,” she added. The security services, she said, would see “the least amount of value” in such a designation, as “usually what I’ve seen is that it is much easier to reach a verdict and a prosecution based upon focusing on the actual acts of violence.” She added: “I think there’s probably a very justified sense of fear around how it could be used in a politically motivated way to target people that are seen as opponents to a more rightwing political government.” The Hungarian government has claimed that antifa, which it calls a “a leftwing terrorist organisation”, is a menace to its citizens. The EU’s law enforcement agency Europol does not use the term “antifa” in its recent Terrorism Situation and Trend report – a document cited in the far-right European parliament resolution. Europol reports 21 attacks attributed to leftwing or anarchist violent extremism in 2024, based on data from 14 countries, excluding Hungary. Nearly all the attacks, which took place in Italy and Greece, targeted property. Hungarian government spokesperson Zoltán Kovács has said antifa members have “brutally beaten people” in the street, and while some were brought before the courts, “those who did not flee justice for the European parliament have received their due.” This is a reference to Ilaria Salis, an Italian activist who became an MEP in 2024, an election that brought an end to nearly 16 months of detention in Hungary , where she was accused of assaulting people suspected of far-right sympathies. Orbán’s political director, Balázs Orbán (no relation), has described Salis as a “far-left antifa activist”. This week, Salis narrowly survived an attempt by the Hungarian government to remove her immunity, after MEPs voted by a majority of one not to grant Budapest’s request. Salis says she is innocent and will not get a fair trial in Hungary, where legal experts have long concluded that the rule of law is compromised . She told the Guardian that Hungary’s use of the term “antifa” was a way of “stigmatising whoever dissents, whoever doesn’t agree with the regime”. She added: “If being anti-fascist means dissenting with his regime, of course I am an anti-fascist.” skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Headlines Europe A digest of the morning's main headlines from the Europe edition emailed direct to you every week day Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The focus on antifa is one more common cause uniting Trump and his European allies. Pawel Zerka, a senior policy fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations, said Trump served as an important inspiration for the new right in Europe, who were willing to emulate his culture war in their own countries. In a recent report, Zerka argued that Trump and the US Maga movement are waging a culture war on Europe by aggressively promoting ideological allies on the continent and seeking to humiliate European leaders on the world stage. Trump, the report argues, provides credibility, framing and coherence to Europe’s new right, from Orbán in Hungary to National Rally leader Marine Le Pen in France, as well as critical infrastructure – conferences, media, funders and thinktanks – that “supports the formation of a Maga internationale”. The notion of antifa, “a copy-paste from the American political debate”, was another way of polarising European societies, Zerka said. “The mere fact that you can claim there is a dangerous political adversary … gives you a powerful engine to also mobilise your base and seek a certain cohesion among domestic forces.”",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/oct/12/european-far-right-follows-trump-in-calling-for-antifa-to-be-declared-terrorists,World,BBC,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/32bdf78278f49dd2b9135f1c0b253dbc81c4d55d/807_215_4205_3365/master/4205.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=1eff651ef54ccd41f3af45b889f899a2",2025-10-12T05:00:44+00:00,1dba4395daf4a9db55205e4fccf7e46007d84896
849c331b9f81,Zelenskyy urges Trump to use Gaza ceasefire momentum to broker peace in Ukraine,,"Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy , urged Donald Trump to use the momentum of the Gaza ceasefire to broker peace in Ukraine, as the two leaders spoke by phone on Saturday. Trump and Zelenskyy discussed Ukraine’s request for the US to allow the delivery of Tomahawk cruise missiles to bolster Kyiv’s ability to conduct long-range strikes inside Russia, among other issues, according to Axios . This follows Trump’s suggestion that he had “sort of made a decision” about selling Tomahawks to Nato countries in order for them to be supplied to Ukraine . “If a war can be stopped in one region, then surely other wars can be stopped as well – including the Russian war,” Zelenskyy wrote on Facebook, a day after Moscow launched a massive drone and missile attack on Ukraine’s energy infrastructure that triggered widespread blackouts in Kyiv and elsewhere. “I informed President Trump about Russia’s attacks on our energy system – and I appreciate his willingness to support us,” Zelenskyy said on X, adding that they had a “very positive and productive” discussion on “concrete agreements” for strengthening Ukraine’s air defences. The phone call took place amid mounting concern in Kyiv over both the increasing scale of Russian air attacks and Ukraine’s ability to counter ever more sophisticated aerial assaults involving hundreds of drones at a time, and more effective Russian countermeasures against Kyiv’s air defences. The commander in chief of Ukraine’s armed forces, Oleksandr Syrskyi, warned that Russia was stepping up its air raids. “New challenges await us ahead. Over the past month, the enemy has increased the number of air attack weapons and although our air defence is about 74% effective, we need to make additional efforts to cover the rear energy sector, critical infrastructure and logistics,” said Syrskyi. Earlier this week, Russia launched 465 Shahed-type attack drones and decoy drones, as well as 32 cruise and ballistic missiles, against Ukraine. The latest talks between Trump and Zelenskyy come amid ongoing discussions in Washington over whether to provide Ukraine with the Tomahawk cruise missiles Kyiv has long been seeking, a move Russia’s president, Vladimir Putin, has warned would be a “completely new, qualitatively new stage of escalation”. The phone call between the two leaders comes amid a warming of relations between the US president and Zelenskyy. The Ukrainian president said in his nightly address on Friday that Russia was taking advantage of the world being “almost entirely focused on the prospect of establishing peace in the Middle East”, and called for strengthening Ukraine’s air defence systems and tighter sanctions on Russia. “Russian assets must be fully used to strengthen our defence and ensure recovery,” he said in the video, posted to X. Meanwhile, the UK prime minister, Keir Starmer, France’s president, Emmanuel Macron, and Germany’s chancellor, Friedrich Merz, said in a joint statement on Friday they were ready to coordinate and move toward using “the value of the immobilised Russian sovereign assets to support Ukraine’s armed forces and thus bring Russia to the negotiation table”. They aimed to do this “in close cooperation with the United States,” the statement added.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/oct/11/zelenskyy-urges-trump-to-use-gaza-ceasefire-momentum-to-broker-peace-in-ukraine,World,BBC,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4d8caf0bcbed22abd1c95b86bee77d88020c1c44/2145_0_1897_1517/master/1897.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=dfdacb6be768901a4927a8087a522f0d",2025-10-11T15:41:21+00:00,a6ee5b4d74f0c21ca23bf5b631b79a2bb1531fe7
e3938fe6aa8c,The Gaza effect: how a global pro-Palestine protest movement met repression and resistance,,"T he ceasefire between Hamas and Israel has been met with joy and relief across the Middle East and beyond. Over the past two years, outrage at Israel’s war in Gaza has erupted across Europe and the US, manifesting itself in university campus protests, massive marches through countless capitals and the disruption of major sporting events. Even as hopes rise of an end to the war, international anger over Israel’s actions in Gaza, which have been deemed a genocide by a UN commission of inquiry , remains raw, as evidenced by last weekend’s huge rallies in Spain and Italy . While the fury that fuels them has been shared and ubiquitous, the demonstrations – and the authorities’ responses to them – have varied considerably from country to country. If some of the official reactions have been draconian, there have also been exceptions, especially in countries where public opinion is more openly pro-Palestinian. Free speech on trial In the US , growing pro-Palestinian activism has been met with arrests, legal action and mounting threats, offering a pretext for the Trump administration’s unprecedented attack on free speech and catalysing what many view as the country’s descent into authoritarianism. In the early months of the war, thousands of people, many of them Jewish , took part in protests. After students at Columbia University set up a pro-Palestinian encampment on campus in the spring of 2024, dozens more followed at other universities across the country. But bowing to pressure from legislators, donors, and pro-Israel critics, many universities responded harshly to the encampments, calling police on to campuses, which led to thousands of arrests . A woman shouts slogans during a pro-Palestine protest in New York. Photograph: Olga Fedorova/EPA Meanwhile, allegations of antisemitism against pro-Palestinian protests have been weaponised by the Trump administration to launch an unprecedented assault on academic freedom , including cutting billions in funding to universities, screening thousands of visa applicants for pro-Palestinian views, and the detention and attempted deportation of foreign scholars over their political views. Policing protests In the UK , the Metropolitan police have so far arrested more than 1,900 people at pro-Palestinian events, the vast majority of whom have been detained for allegedly expressing support for Palestine Action , a direct action group that has been proscribed under anti-terrorism legislation. The UN human rights chief, Volker Türk, has called for the ban to be rescinded , describing it as “disproportionate and unnecessary”. The prime minister, Keir Starmer, who described plans for protests on the second anniversary of the 7 October Hamas attack on Israel as “un-British” , has said his government will look at further curbs on protests , including potential powers to take action against specific chants at pro-Palestinian demonstrations. Starmer also urged protesters to show respect by calling off their activities in the immediate aftermath of the Manchester synagogue terror attack , in which two people died.

Photograph: Guy Bell/Shutterstock Historic tensions In Germany , whose postwar identity has been indelibly shaped by the Nazi regime’s responsibility for the Holocaust, the protests have revealed tensions between popular feeling and the country’s longstanding solidarity with Israel . Even as public opinion has turned against the Israeli government’s relentless assault on Gaza – a recent pro-Palestinian rally in Berlin attracted about 100,000 demonstrators – successive German governments have reaffirmed the principle that responsibility for Israel’s security is part of Berlin’s own Staatsräson , or reason of state. Activists have repeatedly said that police tactics have been excessive, at times brutal, and in violation of constitutional protections of freedom of assembly and expression. Much of the dispute between pro-Palestinian demonstrators and German authorities has centred around which slogans are banned under the law as antisemitic. In May last year, a pro-Palestinian activist was convicted of condoning a crime for using the chant, “from the river to the sea, Palestine will be free”, at a rally four days after the 7 October attacks. The judge said she “could not comprehend” the logic of previous German court rulings that determined the saying was “ambiguous”, and that, to her, it was clear it “denied the right of the state of Israel to exist”. This chant however has also been widely used to call for equal rights both in Israel and Palestine. When asked about crackdowns on pro-Palestinian activism after an alleged case of brutality against an Irish protester , Berlin police this month said they had opened an investigation into the officer but denied a pattern of violence or infringement of civil rights. Artists and intellectuals have cited a chilling effect in Germany around support for the Palestinian cause since the 7 October attacks, as criticism of Israeli tactics in Gaza can be quickly smeared as antisemitism, resulting in the withdrawal of prizes, positions and public funding. Meanwhile, many Jewish leaders in Germany have described a sense of isolation over the last two years and point to a sharp rise in attacks on Jews and Jewish institutions . Liberty in question In May this year, France ’s interior ministry announced it would dissolve the pro-Palestinian human rights and solidarity collective, Urgence Palestine, stating that it condoned Hamas, called for intifada in France, and provoked hatred, violence and discrimination against Jewish people. Urgence Palestine has contested these allegations, saying that the move to dissolve it is politically motivated and part of a wider crackdown on pro-Palestinian activism. The collective has not yet been dissolved. Marie Laure Geoffray, freedoms advocacy officer for Amnesty International France , said there had been “significant repression and a silencing of voices in solidarity with Palestine” and that this was ongoing. She said it had taken various forms in France, including the banning of some street demonstrations in certain cities, the decision to dissolve Urgence Palestine, as well as legal action. Geoffray said students on French campuses had also been accused of disrupting the peace or troubling the public order. Strikes and solidarity In Italy , the extent of public opinion against Israel’s war became evident on 22 September, when tens of thousands of people took to the streets calling for an end to the conflict as part of a general strike coordinated by trade unions. The mostly peaceful event was overshadowed by clashes between police and masked protesters at Milan’s central train station, giving the prime minister, Giorgia Meloni, an opportunity to condemn the “shameful” scenes and attack her leftwing opponents rather than show solidarity with the Palestinians. Police said at least 250,000 people turned out for a pro-Palestine march in Rome last Saturday. Photograph: Alessandro Bremec/NurPhoto/Shutterstock The pressure on Meloni increased further when Israel’s interception of the Global Sumud Flotilla triggered protests across Italy nine days later. Rome’s police said at least 250,000 people turned out for a march, which came a day after more than 2 million people took part in a one-day general strike to support Palestinians in Gaza. Meloni’s government is mindful of public opinion, and in recent months has become increasingly critical of Israel’s killing of Palestinians – even as Italy remains one of Israel’s strongest EU allies. Meloni now says Italy would recognise a Palestinian state if the remaining Israeli hostages were freed and the militant group Hamas was out of government. ‘We steward ourselves’ In Ireland , which joined Spain and Norway in formally recognising a Palestinian state in May 2024, the police force, An Garda Síochána, has mostly applied a light touch to Gaza protests, which usually pass without incident. Government policy and public opinion are strongly pro-Palestinian , which creates a supportive atmosphere for marches and rallies. “Overall it’s kind of hands-off policing,” said Zoë Lawlor, the chair of the Ireland Palestine Solidarity Campaign. “National demonstrations pass off fine. In Limerick we have a demonstration every week and we never see the Garda unless the far right show up too. Otherwise we just steward ourselves.” In Ireland, government policy and public opinion are strongly pro-Palestinian, which creates a supportive atmosphere for marches and rallies. Photograph: Clodagh Kilcoyne/Reuters Police have on occasion been “heavy-handed” when dealing with sit-ins and other acts of civil disobedience but that did not compare with the “shocking” police behaviour in some other countries, said Lawlor. Ireland enjoyed greater freedom to protest than in countries such as the UK, US and Germany, but Irish policing still required monitoring, said Joe O’Brien, the executive director of the Irish Council for Civil Liberties. “We have heard testimony, including allegations of unnecessary strip-searches and a cavity search, that raises serious concerns regarding Garda compliance with human rights frameworks and national law, regulations and policies governing the treatment of people in custody.” In May, the then Garda commissioner, Drew Harris, said allegations of strip-searches were inaccurate and that his force at all times had acted professionally and lawfully. A nation mobilised Similarly, Spain has proved something of an exception when it comes to government support for protests. Not long after more than 100,000 pro-Palestinian demonstrators forced a premature, scrappy and sporadically violent end to the Vuelta a España cycle race in Madrid last month, due to the participation of the Israel Premier Tech team , senior Spanish politicians lined up to bemoan the damage the protest had done to the country’s global reputation. Figures in the conservative People’s party called the episode “an international embarrassment” and compared scenes on the streets of Madrid to “Sarajevo during the war”. But one political figure took a different line. Spain’s socialist prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, said he had “a deep admiration” for all those who had protested in a non-violent manner and for “a Spanish society that mobilises against injustice and defends its ideas in a peaceful manner”. Sánchez, who had already been fiercely criticised by his adversaries, also said he hoped the events in Madrid would lead others to reconsider whether Israel should be included in major sporting events. Last weekend, an estimated 200,000 people rallied across dozens of cities to show their solidarity with Palestine. Both the protests and the prime minister’s backing for them demonstrate the strength of public opinion in a country where, according to a recent poll , 82% of people believe Israel is committing genocide in Gaza. Sánchez’s conservative opponents have also recently begun to step up their criticisms of Israel’s conduct in Gaza , while King Felipe – hardly a habitual courter of controversy – used a speech before the UN last month to beg Israel to “stop the massacre” and end its “abhorrent acts” in Gaza.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/oct/11/the-gaza-effect-how-a-global-pro-palestine-protest-movement-met-repression-and-resistance,World,BBC,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/38bdab37cda3dc45d9796cfa4aa6dce8f61c46d2/1_0_4998_4000/master/4998.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=bac62e0a0f9fa498b064501624060ece",2025-10-11T14:04:49+00:00,09cfc77dbbfaf55aa050138c1cbd27a210a17a0f
5d2e952717d9,‘It’s a question of humanity’: how a small Spanish town made headlines over its immigration stance,,"Flanked by farmland and nestled among the deep valleys of central Spain , few in Villamalea, a town of 4,200 people, expected to find their tranquil home splashed across Spanish media this summer. “I’ve never been contacted by so many media outlets in my life,” said José Núñez Pérez, the conservative mayor of Villamalea. With a laugh, he added: “It made me question, just what have we done here?” Everyone wanted to speak to him about the same thing; a town council motion, approved unanimously and across party lines, calling on the central government to push forward with a stalled proposal to regularise undocumented migrants in Spain. “To us, it was the most natural thing in the world,” explained Núñez Pérez, as he paused to greet residents in the town’s central plaza. In recent decades, migrants from across the globe had been atrracted to Villamalea for the many jobs on offer. The steady supply of labour had helped turn the town into an agricultural heavyweight – about 70% of the mushrooms sold in Spain come from here – while also transforming Villamalea into a rich tapestry of residents whose roots trace back to 32 countries. José Núñez Pérez, mayor of Villamalea: ‘We didn’t even debate it, we were all onboard right away.’ Photograph: Pablo Garcia/The Guardian For the 11 town councillors who backed the motion to grant papers to undocumented migrants – from Núñez Pérez’s People’s party to the Socialists and the United Left – this reality took precedence over party lines. “We didn’t even debate it, we were all onboard right away,” said Núñez Pérez. “There’s a lot of work to be done here. And there could be even more – the problem for these companies is that they can’t find enough people to work.” With the town’s companies weighing up whether to bring in temporary foreign workers, it only made sense to allow those who were already here a fair chance at a foothold. “It’s not just economics, it’s a question of humanity,” said the mayor. In late August, the president of the European Central Bank, Christine Lagarde, said gross domestic output in Germany would have been about 6% lower in 2019 if it hadn’t been for foreign workers. The picture was similar across the eurozone, she said. “Although they represented only around 9% of the total labour force in 2022, foreign workers have accounted for half of its growth over the past three years.” In recent decades, migrants have been attracted to Villamalea for the many jobs on offer. Photograph: Pablo Garcia/The Guardian In Spain, where the Socialist prime minister has insisted that migration is an opportunity, a surge in arrivals has helped to make the country a bright spot among Europe’s plodding economies. Of late, even some of the most ardent critics of immigration have conceded its necessity; in June Italy’s Giorgia Meloni, the far-right leader who has long called irregular migrants a threat to Europe’s future, said her government would issue nearly 500,000 new work visas for non-EU nationals in the coming years, in addition to the 450,000 handed out since she took power. While regularisation programmes have long been used across the EU, with 43 put in place by more than a dozen countries between 1996 and 2008, in Villamalea the push to grant papers was also rooted in the town’s history. Venancio Cuenca Lopéz, president of the Villamalea Retirees Association: ‘We’re all human beings, we need to have some empathy.’ Photograph: Pablo Garcia/The Guardian During much of the 20th century, the town’s residents were forced to fan out across Europe in search of work, said Venancio Cuenca Lopéz, the head of a local retiree association. “Some of them had papers, but some had no papers, no job offers, nothing,” he said. “We can’t say: ‘Well we did it, but now we’re against it.’ We’re all human beings, we need to have some empathy.” He pushed back against claims that regularisation would push down wages. “There are companies that take advantage of undocumented workers, forcing them to work in poor conditions and paying them little. Then Spaniards can’t work because they’re competing with people who are getting paid peanuts,” he said. “So we regularise them, everyone has the same conditions.” skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Headlines Europe A digest of the morning's main headlines from the Europe edition emailed direct to you every week day Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

From the pensioners who make up about a quarter of the town’s population to the around 20% who were born abroad – the majority from Morocco or Romania – residents shrugged off the far-right’s efforts to disparage diversity. “Here everyone has their life and their world, but when we get to together we all get along,” said María Anguix García. At Villamalea’s town hall, officials are swift to cite the efforts many have made to foster integration, keenly aware that they’re doing so against a backdrop of swirling disinformation about migration. “There was a day when people who practise Islam went to the church and got to know the prayer space and then they did the reverse; the Catholics went to the mosque and experienced it,” said the mayor “And around two months later, the five religions we have in Villamalea came together to pray in the church.” When the flood of media requests poured in earlier this year, most wanted to know how Núñez Pérez reconciled his stance with others in the conservative People’s party, particularly as the leader, Alberto Núñez Feijóo, was increasingly linking immigration to insecurity. ‘I’m paid by the people of this town,’ says the mayor, José Núñez Pérez. Photograph: Pablo Garcia/The Guardian Across the country, PP politicians have entered into governments supported by the far-right, anti-immigrant Vox party. As a result, PP politicians have lurched further to the right, leading to motions such as the one recently seen in Jumilla, a town of about 27,000 residents, where the PP-led council backed a ban on religious gatherings in public sports centres that appeared to target Muslims. Núñez Pérez bristled at the comparison. “I’ve always said that I’m not paid by my party, I’m paid by the people of this town,” he said. “In my party, as in all parties, there are differences of opinion. But if you look at the wider picture, we’re not that different.” It was, after all, the PP who had carried out more regularisation programmes than any other party since Spain returned to democracy. Others in the PP had also followed in Núñez Pérez’s footsteps; in late September, about 20 miles (32km) away in the town of Tarazona de la Mancha, a similar mix of councillors, though headed by a Socialist mayor, had come together to unanimously pass their own motion calling on the central government to grant papers to undocumented migrants. Even so, Núñez Pérez knew that the fact that he was a conservative mayor backing regularisation had become a “morbid” fascination for many. “But I think it’s the most natural thing; I know what happens in my town, we live quietly, we live in peace and we learn from each other,” he said. “In interviews they always ask me about my political party. But just because someone fires a shot over there, it doesn’t mean we’re all going to do the same.”",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/oct/11/small-spanish-town-headlines-immigration-villamalea,World,BBC,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/50a7b541e661df9ac8a0a7f1ed23aee3509bd4d5/0_0_5000_4000/master/5000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=8519ce540a23af27c7254ac86ab8f72c",2025-10-11T12:00:22+00:00,b6a896363270368fb451cc0bea0298dd2d698905
d642915dba67,Number of wild bee species at risk of extinction in Europe doubles in 10 years,,"The number of wild bee species in Europe at risk of extinction has more than doubled over the past decade, while the number of endangered butterfly species has almost doubled. The jeopardy facing crucial pollinators was revealed by scientific studies for the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) red list of threatened species , which found that at least 172 bee species out of 1,928 were at risk of extinction in Europe. The number of butterflies threatened with extinction in Europe has increased from 37 to 65 since the last study, conducted 14 years ago. One species, the Madeiran large white ( Pieris wollastoni ) has now been declared extinct. “ Beyond their beauty and cultural significance, pollinators like bees and butterflies are lifelines for our health, our food systems and our economies – sustaining the fruits, vegetables and seeds that nourish us,” said Grethel Aguilar, the IUCN director general. “The latest European red list assessments reveal serious challenges, with threats mounting for butterflies and crucial wild bee species.” The causes of the rapid recent declines are the continuing destruction or damage of habitats caused by agricultural intensification and land abandonment, draining wetlands, overgrazing by livestock, and the use of fertilisers and pesticides including neonicotinoids . The fragmentation of pollinator-friendly habitat greatly increases the risk of local extinctions. Global heating is also revealed to be a major threat: 52% of all endangered butterflies in Europe are imperilled by the climate crisis – approximately twice as many as a decade ago. Up to 90% of flowering plants in Europe depend on animal pollination, according to Dr Denis Michez, lead coordinator of the wild bee assessment. “Sadly, wild bee populations are in drastic decline and cannot be easily replaced by managed colonies,” he said. “If wild bees disappear, many wild plants might be at risk too – of which flower-rich meadows and beautiful orchid species are just a few examples.” Fifteen species of bumblebee, which play a crucial role in pollinating peas, beans, peanuts and clover, and 14 species of cellophane bee, known for pollinating trees such as willows and red maples, are now classified as threatened. Simpanurgus phyllopodus , a mining bee unique to the continent and the only species of this genus in Europe, is now assessed as critically endangered – the scientific category closest to extinction in the wild. Butterflies that are only found on mountain tops are particularly vulnerable to global heating as they need to move uphill as their habitats become warmer but eventually run out of space. In southern Spain, the Nevada grayling and the Andalusian anomalous blue are among more than 40% of European endemics (only found in Europe) threatened with extinction. In the Mediterranean, species such as the critically endangered Karpathos grayling are imperilled by extreme drought and wildfires . Meanwhile, in the Arctic Circle, global heating is causing the tree line to move north by tens of metres each year, with scrub encroaching on bog and tundra. Warmer conditions also mean reindeer can no longer cross the ice to graze Arctic grasslands and keep them open. Eight butterfly species are threatened with extinction in this region, including Freyja’s fritillary and the Arctic ringlet. “ The biggest habitat for all these pollinators is flower-rich grassland and that is disappearing very fast across Europe because of all these factors,” said Martin Warren, one of the lead coordinators of the butterflies assessment. “The positive thing is that so many people care now and there’s a lot more awareness. Under the EU nature restoration legislation , all member states have to reverse the decline in pollinators by 2030, and they are going to have to start doing something. There are landowners who are interested. Let’s hope they can get the incentives that will help them on their way.” According to Warren, there is “low-hanging fruit” in terms of action for pollinators which won’t reduce food production – and may enhance it – such as farmers creating flower-rich margins around their fields. Jessika Roswall, EU commissioner for environment, water resilience and a competitive circular economy, described the conservation status of wild bees, butterflies and other pollinators as “dire”. “ Urgent and collective action is needed to tackle this threat. Together with member states, the European Commission has put in place an EU-wide monitoring system for pollinators based on the EU nature restoration regulation, which will help to track our progress. Now, we need to focus on implementation and cooperation with member states to protect our pollinators,” she said. The publication of the bee and butterfly assessments comes after the first Europe-wide assessment of hoverflies , another crucial pollinator group. Published in 2022, it revealed that 37% of all hoverfly species in Europe were threatened with extinction.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/oct/11/number-of-wild-bee-species-at-risk-of-extinction-in-europe-doubles-in-10-years,World,BBC,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7a23b03eed35572a99f28680f090b3af3aeb48c1/288_0_2880_2304/master/2880.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=91af38e921cbaa62f7eb0700a9d3bb15",2025-10-11T08:45:18+00:00,085819b7cc36044b6050637127df3d2bb2ca53c5

He added that the Middle East was now on the “cusp of a sustainable peace”. “Knock on wood we feel very confident that hostages will be released, and that the president is actually traveling to the Middle East, likely this evening in order to meet them and greet them in person,” Vance told CBS’s Face the Nation on Sunday. Vance called the first step in the implementation of the 20-point peace agreement, “a big day for their families, but I think more importantly, it’s a big day for the entire world.” He said the deal was “a very tall task” and Trump had “pursued a very non-traditional diplomacy with people who were not 40-year diplomats, but people who brought a fresh perspective to it.” “We are now on the cusp of a sustainable peace in the Middle East,” Vance added. JD Vance confirmed that Donald Trump would travel to the Middle East on Sunday to meet with Israeli hostages. Photograph: Lenin Nolly/SIPA/Shutterstock But he warned that phase two of the agreement, which includes Hamas agreeing to hand over weapons and the administration of Gaza to a Palestinian body of independent technocrats, “is going to take consistent leverage and consistent pressure from the President of the United States on down”. Vance was asked how long 200 US troops would remain in the area. “These are not troops who are going to be put in Gaza, but they’re troops who are already at Central Command (Al Udeid airbase in Qatar). They’ve been at that base for many, many years, and they’re going to help monitor and mediate this peace.” But Vance said: Inevitably, they’re going to be conflicts here. There are going to be things that the people in Gaza disagree with Israel about, and the Israelis disagree with the Gulf Arab states about. We see our role really as mediating some of those disputes and the pressure stays on everybody to achieve a durable and lasting piece. Vance predicted that Arab countries and Muslim-majority countries, including Indonesia, would provide troops to ensure Gaza’s security and that would “make it possible to rebuild, possible to dismantle terrorist networks and possible to ensure a lasting peace.” The US, he said, “is going to continue to play our mediation role, and I think that’s a very, very good place for all of us to be.” Share Updated at 10.52 EDT Key events Show key events only Please turn on JavaScript to use this feature Canadian prime minister Mark Carney will travel to Sharm El-Sheikh, Egypt, to attend the Gaza summit, his office announced on Sunday.

Share Updated at 16.29 EDT President Biden’s national security adviser Jake Sullivan gave credit on Sunday to President Trump for the Gaza deal in an interview on CNN’s State of the Union. Sullivan, who served as Biden’s national security adviser between 2021 and January this year, said: “It’s a good thing that a ceasefire is in place, that the hostages will be coming out, and that a surge of aid will be going in. On a very human level, we should all take a moment to express gratitude for this moment and hope that everything that unfolds from here is positive. I’m feeling very good this morning, although I won’t feel totally comfortable until we see this fully implemented.” Asked if Trump deserved credit for the deal, Sullivan said: “Of course he does. I give credit to President Trump, [US special envoy Steve] Witloff, Kushner, and Rubio. These are hard jobs … Achieving something like today takes a village, determination, and hard work. I offer credit for that. The question now is whether we can ensure this sticks as we move forward. There will be no long-term solution if there is not a credible pathway to a Palestinian state, and I hope the administration will adhere to that.” Share Updated at 16.01 EDT Israel’s prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu acknowledged controversy over his handling of the Gaza ceasefire and hostage release deal Sunday, but called for their imminent release to be a moment of unity. “This is an emotional evening, an evening of tears, an evening of joy, because tomorrow our children will return to our borders,” the Israeli leader said, quoting a biblical verse. “Tomorrow is the beginning of a new path - a path of rebuilding, a path of healing, and, I hope, a path of united hearts,” he said, in a televised address. He also warned that “the campaign is not over,” adding: “there are still very great security challenges ahead of us.” Iran says it was invited to the Gaza summit in Egypt but has not confirmed whether it will attend, according to state media. Tehran confirmed on Sunday that it received an official invitation from Cairo to attend the summit in Sharm El-Sheikh but did not say if it would send a representative. At a cabinet meeting, foreign minister, Abbas Araghchi, briefed the government on Egypt’s invitation to president Masoud Pezeshkian. “Iran’s subsequent refusal, and a later invitation extended to the foreign minister,” IRNA state news agency reported, without disclosing whether Araghchi would attend. Share Updated at 14.44 EDT Hamas’ government media office is rejecting a BBC report about the deployment of 7,000 new Hamas operatives to reassert its dominance in Gaza where the Israeli military has withdrawn from. The Hamas statement says: “This information has no basis in truth.” It further says the claims “reflect deliberate misinformation and false narratives intended to mislead the public”. According to the BBC report, Hamas mobilised its security forces via phone calls and texts, informing its operatives that they were required to “cleanse Gaza of outlaws and collaborators with Israel” and to report for duty within 24 hours. Share Updated at 14.21 EDT Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy said today that he hopes a similar agreement to the Israel-Hamas ceasefire can be orchestrated to put an end to the ongoing war between his own country and Russia. “This is real success,” Zelenskyy said on Fox News. “It gives signals for us and hope that with such pressure, what president Trump used in the Middle East to make peace, and I hope that he will use the same instruments, even more, to pressure Putin to stop his war in Ukraine.” Ukraine has been at war with Russia for more than 1,300 days since Putin’s invasion in February 2022. Trump has faced particular difficulty with ending the conflict, expressing frustration on several occasions at both Putin and Zelenskyy. Israel’s army chief, Lt Gen Eyal Zamir said that the country achieved a “victory over Hamas” through the military pressure exerted over the past two years , combined with diplomatic efforts. “The military pressure we applied over the past two years, together with complementary diplomatic measures, constitute a victory over Hamas,” Zamir said in a televised statement. “We will continue to act in order to shape a security reality that ensures the Gaza Strip no longer poses a threat to the State of Israel and its civilians ... Through our operations, we are reshaping the Middle East and our security strategy for the years ahead,” he added.

One peacekeeper was lightly injured and received medical assistance,” a statement from the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) reads. “Before the grenade was dropped, peacekeepers had observed two drones flying near their position.” It continues: “This is the second IDF grenade attack on peacekeepers this month. It represents another serious violation of resolution 1701 and concerning disregard for the safety of peacekeepers implementing their mandate from the Security Council. We again call on the IDF to cease attacks on or near peacekeepers, who are working to rebuild the stability that both Israel and Lebanon have committed to restore.” Netanyahu’s spokesperson has responded to the strong negative reaction from the massive crowd at a rally in Hostages Square in Tel Aviv last night , where the mention of the Israeli prime minister’s name drew loud boos from a large number of people in attendance. Spokesperson Shosh Bedrosian told a press briefing today that Netanyahu “has got us to this point in cooperation and coordination with President Trump,” adding: “Prime Minister Netanyahu took risks, and those risks led us to this point.” She added: “The first phase of this plan is releasing all of our hostages, and that was a dedication and a promise he made to those families, and here I am standing today telling you that the prime minister is following through, following through on that promise.” Share Updated at 12.11 EDT The Palestinian Authority is ready to work with US president Donald Trump and former British prime minister Tony Blair on their effort to consolidate the Gaza ceasefire and start rebuilding , a senior Palestinian official told Blair on Sunday. Trump’s plan for ending the Gaza war holds out the prospect of the Palestinian Authority, based in the Israeli-occupied West Bank and led by president Mahmoud Abbas, eventually taking control of Gaza, but only after it completes reforms. Abbas lost control of Gaza to the Hamas militant group in 2007. Trump’s proposal says Hamas must end its rule of Gaza and foresees the territory being run by a Palestinian technocratic committee supervised by an international body chaired by him and including Blair. Hussein al-Sheikh, deputy head of the Palestine Liberation Organization, said he had met Blair to discuss the day after in Gaza and making Trump’s plan for “stopping the Gaza war and establishing lasting peace in the region a success”. “We have confirmed our readiness to work with President Trump, Mr Blair and the partners to consolidate the ceasefire, the entry of aid, the release of hostages and prisoners, and then start with the recovery and reconstruction,” Sheikh wrote on X.

In May, Manar al-Houbi received confirmation of her successful application. “It felt almost too good to be true,” she said. As well as her tuition fees, her scholarship from a charity, the Council for At Risk Academics (Cara), covers housing and living costs for her and all family members.

As part of a UK crackdown on immigration, most international students are not allowed to bring their dependants with them. However, there are exceptions for full-time PhD students such as Houbi, whose scholarship and visa permit her to bring her family.

Share Updated at 11.30 EDT Trump to meet with hostages, JD Vance confirms, as he says 'we are on cusp of a sustainable Middle East peace' Edward Helmore US vice-president JD Vance confirmed that Donald Trump would travel to the Middle East on Sunday to meet with Israeli hostages who will be released under the first phase of the Israel-Hamas peace agreement. He added that the Middle East was now on the “cusp of a sustainable peace”. “Knock on wood we feel very confident that hostages will be released, and that the president is actually traveling to the Middle East, likely this evening in order to meet them and greet them in person,” Vance told CBS’s Face the Nation on Sunday. Vance called the first step in the implementation of the 20-point peace agreement, “a big day for their families, but I think more importantly, it’s a big day for the entire world.” He said the deal was “a very tall task” and Trump had “pursued a very non-traditional diplomacy with people who were not 40-year diplomats, but people who brought a fresh perspective to it.” “We are now on the cusp of a sustainable peace in the Middle East,” Vance added. JD Vance confirmed that Donald Trump would travel to the Middle East on Sunday to meet with Israeli hostages. Photograph: Lenin Nolly/SIPA/Shutterstock But he warned that phase two of the agreement, which includes Hamas agreeing to hand over weapons and the administration of Gaza to a Palestinian body of independent technocrats, “is going to take consistent leverage and consistent pressure from the President of the United States on down”. Vance was asked how long 200 US troops would remain in the area. “These are not troops who are going to be put in Gaza, but they’re troops who are already at Central Command (Al Udeid airbase in Qatar). They’ve been at that base for many, many years, and they’re going to help monitor and mediate this peace.” But Vance said: Inevitably, they’re going to be conflicts here. There are going to be things that the people in Gaza disagree with Israel about, and the Israelis disagree with the Gulf Arab states about. We see our role really as mediating some of those disputes and the pressure stays on everybody to achieve a durable and lasting piece. Vance predicted that Arab countries and Muslim-majority countries, including Indonesia, would provide troops to ensure Gaza’s security and that would “make it possible to rebuild, possible to dismantle terrorist networks and possible to ensure a lasting peace.” The US, he said, “is going to continue to play our mediation role, and I think that’s a very, very good place for all of us to be.” Share Updated at 10.52 EDT Here are some of the latest images being sent to us over the newswires from Gaza: Palestinian people search the rubble of buildings amid widespread destruction in Khan Younis in the southern Gaza Strip.

cd882e2ed056,Tony Blair wins nod from Palestinian Authority for role in postwar Gaza,,"The former UK prime minister Tony Blair appears to have won the endorsement of the Palestinian Authority to be involved in the reconstruction of Gaza, after an exploratory meeting in Jordan. Blair met Hussein al-Sheikh, the deputy president of the Palestinian Authority (PA) and head of the Palestine Liberation Organisation executive committee, in Amman, Jordan, on Sunday. It was the first such meeting since Donald Trump announced Blair’s role in his 20-point plan . Although Blair was present in New York for key meetings with Arab leaders at the UN general assembly, this is the first attempt to test the water about his possible role with the Palestinian leadership. Hamas, which has said it will not have a future role in the government of Gaza, has opposed Blair’s involvement and the idea that any board should act as foreign guardian for Palestine . The precise powers of the US president’s proposed “board of peace” and its relationship to a technocratic committee of appointed Palestinians has yet to be clarified. In a statement, al-Sheikh said: “Today, I met Mr Tony Blair to discuss the day after the war and making President Trump’s efforts, which aim at stopping the war and establishing lasting peace in the region, a success. We have confirmed our readiness to work with President Trump, Mr Blair and the partners to consolidate the ceasefire, the entry of aid, the release of hostages and prisoners, and then start with the recovery and reconstruction.” He continued: “We stressed the importance of stopping the undermining of the PA, and especially the return of withheld Palestinian revenues, and preventing the undermining of the two-state solution in preparation for a comprehensive and lasting peace in accordance with international legitimacy.” The PA is keen that tax revenues withheld by the Israeli government are released, since this is preventing salary payments and undermining its liquidity, in violation of the Oslo accords. Israel has also threatened not to renew next month the annual waiver of terrorist financing laws, which allows Israeli banks to process transactions with Palestinian banks. Sharhabeel al-Zaeem, the PA’s justice minister, last week criticised Blair’s involvement, saying: “Is this the independent Palestinian state we are aiming for? All these struggles for all these years in order to have Mr Blair, who failed in London, who failed in Britain, who failed in Iraq, come and – with all due respect at a personal level to Mr Blair – be our guardian as if we were minors?” Blair will have to negotiate a fine line since neither the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, nor the Trump administration have yet said they are willing to work with the PA. Trump banned the PA president, Mahmoud Abbas, from flying to the UN, although reports on Sunday suggested Abbas would attend Monday’s summit in Egypt. The Trump plan did not specify when power would be transferred to a reformed PA, but at a minimum the PA would have to hold elections and show it was capable of overseeing the vast reconstruction effort. Blair has reassured the PA that its involvement is a sign Gaza and the West Bank will eventually be governed as one entity. French diplomats said they were also starting to work on a possible UN security council mandate for the planned international stabilisation force Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner, with whom Blair has a close relationship, has frequently insulted Abbas, describing him as a leader of refugee group.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/oct/12/tony-blair-wins-nod-from-palestine-authority-for-role-in-postwar-gaza,World,BBC,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bf8cba4e62f06140e2206bee094fef191b568021/595_0_4453_3563/master/4453.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=1b3070ca3b12d2fb7b1768cbc649523e",2025-10-12T18:39:04+00:00,68a598cf2f21950c5ab57db004e49e15fe9ba345
99c8aa3f104f,‘My heart is broken’: Palestinians begin searching the Gaza rubble for their dead,,"G hali Khadr spent two days pleading with his parents to flee with him to southern Gaza, warning them that it was too dangerous to stay. His father, known for being stubborn, refused. Their argument was never finished – an Israeli airstrike hit his father’s home, burying his parents beneath the rubble. On Sunday, two days after the ceasefire was announced, Khadr returned to search through the ruins of his parents’ home. He spent the day sifting through shattered concrete and twisted metal for any sign of them. All he managed to find were some shards of their skulls and parts of their hands. Ghali Khadr. Photograph: Amjed Tantesh/The Guardian “My father, a retired ambulance driver, was known for his strong will and patience. He did not know fear and was always optimistic,” said Khadr, 40, of Jabaliya in northern Gaza . Khadr took the remains of his parents to the graveyard, but found that it too had been destroyed. He decided to bury them next to the few graves that were still intact. The destruction left by Israel’s offensive on Gaza City. Photograph: Amjed Tantesh/The Guardian Like Khadr, thousands of Palestinians have returned to northern Gaza since Friday’s ceasefire with a grim task ahead of them: searching for loved ones killed weeks or months earlier in Israeli airstrikes and whose bodies are buried under the rubble. Gaza’s civil defence agency estimates that the bodies of about 10,000 people are trapped under the debris and collapsed buildings. The halt in the fighting has given the ambulance service the chance to finally start the search for the dead and give their families a chance at closure. The task ahead of the rescuers is immense given an estimated 60m tonnes of rubble across the territory. Bodies unearthed by Israeli bulldozers in the northern Gaza neighbourhood of Sheikh Radwan. Photograph: Amjed Tantesh/The Guardian Most roads have been destroyed or blocked by debris. Civil defence workers are short of heavy equipment and have to use pickaxes and sledgehammers to break through collapsed buildings. Rescue crews have to move slowly. The debris is also full of unexploded bombs and ordnance. “At first, we are focusing on collecting the corpses lying in the streets to preserve what remains of them, especially with the presence of stray dogs that have been attacking bodies,” said Khaled al-Ayoubi, 64, the civil defence chief for northern Gaza. Other rescuers are forced to dig through rubble with their bare hands. So far, they have only recovered a fraction of the 10,000 missing people and have yet to begin searching through the ruins of multistorey buildings.

Photograph: Amjed Tantesh/The Guardian If Israel permits the entry of heavy equipment in the coming days, all the bodies should be recovered within six months to a year, said Dr Mohammed al-Mugheer, 38, the director of humanitarian support and international cooperation at the Gaza civil defence agency. Many residents of northern Gaza cannot bear to wait that long. They have begun to return to their ruined homes to search for their loved ones on their own. Yahya al-Muqra, 32, from Jabaliya, believes his brother, Sharif, is dead. He lost contact with him after an Israeli airstrike on their home on 25 July. He managed to visit the razed buildingbut found no sign of Sharif’s body. “We went to check the area, but found no trace of him, as if he had vanished, the house and everything around it had turned to rubble,” Muqra said. “Witnesses said they last saw him near the house.” His brother suffered from epilepsy, and he worries that even if the airstrike did not kill him, he would have died without his medication. On Sunday, Muqra finally had the time to search for his brother, but working by himself he could find no sign of him. Palestinians search the rubble in Khan Younis. Photograph: Omar Al-Qattaa/AFP/Getty Images “I was hoping to find something that proves Sharif was there, a piece of clothing, any trace. We really need heavy machinery to search under the rubble, but these machines are unavailable,” he said. For many families, the pain of not knowing where, when or how their loved ones died is immense. They have spent months in exile from their homes, waiting in limbo for the chance to find even a fragment of those they lost, something to say goodbye to. Providing families with that chance is what drives Gaza’s rescue workers, who labour painstakingly under the intense sun while anxious families wait by their side. “Families feel that recovering the bodies of their martyrs is a way to honour them and preserve their souls, and it reassures them that their loved ones truly became martyrs and are no longer alive,” said Fadi al-Salibi, 35, a civil defence employee. Muqra hopes that the coming days will reveal something about his brother’s fate. With the cemeteries in his neighbourhood destroyed, he plans to bury Sharif in the garden of his home. “My heart is broken because my brother has not been buried yet. Even a single bone would allow us to lay him to rest and feel some relief,” he said.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/oct/12/my-heart-is-broken-palestinians-begin-searching-the-gaza-rubble-for-their-dead,World,BBC,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0c739cf30d5a1aa57f8c3f4619c8a5afc6c12ad3/495_195_3537_2829/master/3537.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=ddbfda72391352a7cfb7f39a02fad218",2025-10-12T18:05:58+00:00,26397b55c613b11fa13849ed07580fcd290295c2
08b0af2bfca9,Israel expects all 20 living hostages to be freed from Gaza on Monday morning,,"The Israeli government says it expects all living hostages held in Gaza to be released on Monday morning and that it is preparing for the release of about 2,000 Palestinian detainees, the crucial next phase of the ceasefire deal that could end the two-year war in Gaza. “We are expecting all 20 of our living hostages to be released together at one time to the Red Cross and transported among six to eight vehicles,” said the Israeli government spokesperson Shosh Bedrosian. Hostages will be driven to a military base to see their families or to hospitals if medical care is needed. The remains of deceased hostages are expected to be sent to the national Institute of Forensic Medicine for identification. An unnamed Hamas official told Al Jazeera that living hostages had been gathered in Gaza and the militant group would meet the Red Cross on Sunday night to agree the logistics of their release. The militant group holds 48 hostages, 20 of whom are believed to be alive . An international taskforce will work on finding the remains of hostages not released on Monday, with many believed to be buried under the rubble somewhere in the devastated Gaza Strip. Israel will also release nearly 2,000 Palestinian detainees, the vast majority of whom will be sent to Gaza or exiled to neighbouring countries, once Israeli hostages are back on Israeli soil. Several Hamas commanders, prominent Palestinian political figures and detained doctors whose releases were requested by Hamas were not on the list of Palestinians to be freed. The doctors Hussam Abu Safiya and Marwan al-Hams, who were detained in Gaza during the war, as well as the prominent Palestinian political leader Marwan Barghouti were not on the list. Hamas said it was still in talks with Israeli negotiators to secure their release.

Photograph: Khaled Desouki/AFP/Getty Images The hostage-detainee swap is the first step in Donald Trump’s 20-point plan to end the war in Gaza. A ceasefire has been in place since Friday afternoon, but most of the details of the US president’s proposals need to be negotiated before a lasting end to the war is established . The US president will visit Jerusalem on Monday to speak at the Knesset, as well as meeting families of the hostages. Trump will then fly to Sharm el-Sheikh in Egypt where he will co-chair a “peace summit” attended by the leaders of more than 20 countries aimed at finalising a permanent truce in Gaza. Though the path ahead for the deal was murky, Trump said he expected a ceasefire would continue. “They’re all tired of the fighting,” he told reporters at the White House, adding that there was a “consensus” on the way forward. Palestinians are desperate to see the ceasefire extend into a permanent end to the war, after two years of an Israeli campaign that destroyed most of the strip, killed more than 67,000 Palestinians and wounded about 170,000. Israel stands accused of conducting genocide in Gaza by a UN commission of inquiry and several human rights bodies. Palestinian flags flutter on top of rubble in Gaza City. Photograph: Bashar Taleb/AFP/Getty Images Israel denies the claim of genocide and says its conduct in the war, launched in retaliation for an attack by Hamas-led militants that killed about 1,200 people and took 251 hostage, constitutes self-defence. In Israel, preparations were under way to receive the hostages, who will be taken to a military base to undergo an examination before being taken to hospitals, which have run drills to prepare for the releases, using actors in place of hostages to practise. “We are very excited, waiting for our son and for all the 48 hostages,” Hagai Angrest, whose son Matan is among the 20 hostages still held in Gaza, told Reuters. On Sunday night, tens of thousands of people cheered in “Hostages Square” in Tel Aviv as the US Middle East envoy, Steve Witkoff, spoke, alongside Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner. “I dreamed of this night. It’s been a long journey,” Witkoff said. The crowd yelled praise for Trump, but booed when Witkoff mentioned the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu. Families in the occupied West Bank also prepared to receive loved ones who were being let out of Israeli jails. Israeli authorities instructed families not to be vocal in their celebrations and warned them to limit their interaction with the media. Roughly 2,000 Palestinian detainees are due to be let out around the same time as the hostages are released. About 1,700 were detainees from Gaza, while 250 were longtime prisoners of Israel, among them Palestinian leaders. About half of the 250 are to be released to Gaza or exiled to neighbouring countries, while the other half will be released to the West Bank or East Jerusalem. As preparations continued for the hostage swap, humanitarian groups geared up to send aid into Gaza. Humanitarian aid trucks enter the Nuseirat refugee camp in the central Gaza Strip. Photograph: Eyad Baba/AFP/Getty Images Cogat, the Israeli military agency that oversees humanitarian aid in Gaza, said it expected about 600 trucks to enter the strip each day, starting on Sunday. This would restore aid to around prewar levels, after months of severely restricted aid into the strip. The UN said about 170,000 metric tonnes of food, medicine and other humanitarian aid was ready to enter Gaza once Israel permits its entry. Tents, high-energy food for malnourished children and menstrual hygiene supplies were among the prioritised aid items. A spokesperson for the World Food Programme, Abeer Etefa, said that roads were being cleared and repaired on Sunday to help facilitate future aid deliveries. The restoration of aid follows months of Israeli siege on Gaza, which resulted in famine in parts of the territory, according to the world’s leading authority on food crises. At least 459 people have died of hunger over the past two years and starvation has spread through the territory since May. The restoration of regular aid is mandated by the Trump plan. The UN will once again coordinate supplies into Gaza after months of being barred by Israel from doing so. Drone footage shows destruction as Gazans reflect on returning back home – video The role of the private Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, which was meant to replace the UN in aid distribution in Gaza, remained unclear. The foundation’s logistics sites in Gaza had stopped operating after the ceasefire deal started. The GHF was widely seen as a failure, with its model of distribution marked by overcrowding and death. More than 1,000 people were shot to death by Israeli soldiers during the daily scramble to access food at the GHF sites, chaos which aid groups said was brought on the foundation’s militarised model of provision. The GHF consistently denied any wrongdoing. A spokesperson for GHF told Reuters there was a temporary closure of aid sites during the hostage transfers, but that there was “no change to our long-term plan”. The US will deploy up to 200 troops in Israel to help establish a taskforce to assist with stabilisation efforts in Gaza. No US troops will be deployed within Gaza, but will advise the taskforce, known as the Civil-Military Coordination Center (CMCC), from within Israel. The head of US Central Command, Adm Brad Cooper, met the Israeli military chief, Eyal Zamir, while travelling to Gaza alongside Witkoff and Kushner.

fef6e033179d,Survivor of 7 October Nova festival attack in Israel found dead,,"An Israeli man whose girlfriend and best friend were murdered in front of him at the Nova music festival on 7 October 2023 has killed himself days after the second anniversary of the terrorist atrocities. Roei Shalev, who was shot during the Nova attack and survived, was found dead in his burned car north of Tel Aviv on Friday night. Hours before his death, Shalev, 30, had posted a message on social media saying he felt he could not go on. “Please don’t be angry with me, please,” he wrote. “No one will ever understand me, and that’s OK because you can’t understand. I just want this suffering to end. I’m alive, but inside everything is dead.” More than 370 revellers were killed when Hamas-led Palestinian militants crossed from Gaza into Israel in the early hours of 7 October 2023 and attacked the music festival and several nearby communities. Shalev’s girlfriend, Mapal Adam, and his best friend, Hili Solomon, were murdered before his eyes as the trio tried to hide under a car. Shalev was shot trying to save his girlfriend, according to Adam’s sister, Maayan. “Roei lay next to the dead love of his life for about two hours until the army arrived and rescued him,” Maayan told Ynet last year. “She was hit by a bullet that penetrated her ribs and went into her heart – I say her heart was so big that it was impossible to miss it.” Shalev’s mother killed herself two weeks after the atrocities. According to Israeli media reports, she had been very close to Adam and was devastated by her death. Maayan Adam posted a picture of her sister and Shalev on Saturday. Its caption read: “Roei was murdered on 7 October and died yesterday. I have no words and it will take time to find them. Hope these two kids are hugging and smiling right now, hearts pressed together again.” The Nova Tribe Community Foundation, which supports survivors of the attack and their families, described Shalev as “a backbone of the community” and said he should be remembered for his bravery and kindness. “We ask to remember him for his beautiful moments, his courageous support of the community, his work as captain of the Nova Tribe basketball team and his constant devotion to helping his friends, sons and daughters of the Tribe during their most difficult and challenging time,” it said in a statement. Several secular opposition politicians – many of whom, unlike most ruling coalition members, remain active on social media during the Jewish sabbath – reacted with dismay to the news on Saturday and called for greater mental health support for survivors of the 7 October attacks. Yair Golan, the head of the leftwing Democrats party, wrote: “Roei could not withstand the pain, but others are still here fighting, coping, trying to live. We must give them all the help we can – so they don’t feel alone.” Agence France-Presse contributed to this report",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/oct/12/roei-shalev-survivor-of-7-october-nova-festival-attack-in-israel-found-dead,World,BBC,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6692abfa572c8e5bb14445d624e699112c8a8b2e/633_207_822_658/master/822.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=b9a734dbfbebf593a4dc3aa7a5694b0b",2025-10-12T12:08:59+00:00,b4d767617a0fb174ff8e380e917a12d260985fd4
9b357860186b,Heavy clashes erupt along Pakistan-Afghanistan border,,"Intense clashes erupted along the Pakistan-Afghanistan border on Saturday night, after an attack by the Afghan Taliban on Pakistani military posts led to a heavy exchange of fire and reportedly left dozens of soldiers dead. According to officials, Afghan troops opened fire on Pakistani army posts along the north-western border with Pakistan on Saturday night and seized several of the posts. The attacks came after the Taliban regime in Afghanistan accused Pakistan of carrying out airstrikes on Afghan territory, including in the capital, Kabul, earlier this week. On Sunday, Pakistan responded with retaliatory strikes, gunfire and ground raids on Afghan Taliban posts along the border. In a statement, the media wing of the Pakistan military said 23 soldiers had been killed and another 29 wounded in the attacks. They claimed that 200 “Taliban and affiliated terrorists” from the Afghan side were killed in their retaliatory strikes and that terrorist training camps had been dismantled. The Taliban spokesperson Zabihullah Mujahid had earlier claimed that Taliban forces killed 58 Pakistani soldiers in the attacks, while just nine from the Taliban side were killed. Taliban security personnel patrol in Spin Boldak, Kandahar, Afghanistan. Photograph: Qudratullah Razwan/EPA The clashes signal a new low in Afghan-Pakistan relations, which have become increasingly hostile amid claims that Afghanistan is giving a safe haven to Islamist militants carrying out an escalating number of deadly attacks on Pakistani soil. Early on Sunday morning, the Taliban government’s defence ministry said its forces had conducted “retaliatory and successful operations” along the border. “If the opposing side again violates Afghanistan’s territorial integrity, our armed forces are fully prepared to defend the nation’s borders and will deliver a strong response,” said the ministry. Pakistan’s media wing accused the Afghan Taliban of launching attacks to “facilitate terrorism”. “Exercising the right of self-defence, the alert armed forces of Pakistan repelled the assault decisively all along the border and inflicted heavy casualties on Taliban forces,” said the statement. “We will not tolerate the treacherous use of Afghan soil for terrorism against Pakistan … the state of Pakistan will not rest until the menace of terrorism emanating from Afghanistan is completely eliminated.” The cross-border strikes came after two explosions were reported in the Afghan capital and another in south-eastern Afghanistan on Thursday. The Taliban-run defence ministry subsequently accused Pakistan of “violating its sovereignty” in connection with the attacks. Pakistan has neither denied nor confirmed carrying out the Kabul strike, only stating that it had carried out “a series of retribution operations”. Analysts said recent days showed just how volatile the situation along the Afghan-Pakistan border had become. The two countries share a nearly 1,600-mile (2,600km) rugged and mountainous border known as the Durand Line, which is contested by Afghanistan. Since the Taliban returned to power in Afghanistan in 2021, the Pakistan government has accused them of giving shelter to the Pakistani Taliban, known as Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), an Islamist militant group who are behind a deadly rise in insurgent attacks in Pakistan’s border region of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. Map Thousands of TTP militant attacks – mostly targeting Pakistani police, paramilitary and army – have been carried out over the past four years, leaving more than 2,500 dead. Islamabad has grown increasingly impatient with Kabul, publicly calling on the Afghan Taliban to stop harbouring TTP militants, accusing them of turning a blind eye to training camps and giving funding and arms to TTP fighters who carry out attacks on Pakistani soil, allegations backed by UN findings. Imtiaz Gul, a security analyst based in Islamabad, said “Pakistan’s patience with Kabul had been wearing thin” as TTP attacks continued to escalate. Just earlier this week, at least three senior army officers, including 20 soldiers, were killed in attacks by the Pakistani Taliban. According to Armed Conflict Location and Event Data, there have been more than 600 attacks by TTP so far this year, the most in a decade. Gul described the clashes as a “logical conclusion of the tensions that had been brewing up between the two countries, particularly after the continuous refusal of the Afghan regime to take demonstrable conclusive action against the TTP, which is spearheading the terrorist attacks in Pakistan.” Speaking at a press conference in Delhi, where he was on an official visit to India this week, the Afghan Taliban foreign minister, Amir Khan Muttaqi, denied that Afghanistan was giving shelter to TTP fighters. “There is no safe haven for TTP in Afghanistan,” he said. Muttaqi said the situation along the Afghan-Pakistan border was now “under control” and that allies Qatar and Saudi Arabia had reached out to “express that the war should stop”. “Afghanistan has the right to keep its territory and its borders safe and so it has retaliated to the violation,” he said. “We achieved the objective of our retaliatory mission … so from our end, we have stopped.” Michael Kugelman, a South Asia analyst based in Washington DC, described the border situation as “precarious”. He emphasised that while the cash-strapped Taliban in Afghanistan “lacks the capacity to fight the Pakistani military head-on”, he cautioned that the strikes could further fuel the cross-border militant insurgency in Pakistan. “The risk is that its recent strikes in Afghanistan will galvanise TTP to carry out reprisals, which could invite further and perhaps more intense Pakistani operations in Afghanistan,” said Kugelman. “And then the cycle could play out again. There are no winners or easy long-term solutions here.”",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/oct/11/heavy-clashes-erupt-along-pakistan-afghanistan-border,World,BBC,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c78cb4d8d819810970aaa4e9b2860e65e72bb2f2/0_0_5030_4024/master/5030.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=a9abb5ed8bad2d354a16a97ed19e29b3",2025-10-12T12:29:38+00:00,ce2ba806c35f69886179dc08eb4a628c39bf78d3

Like thousands of other young people, he had taken to the streets of the capital last month to protest against corruption and a draconian ban on social media. He had no idea that day in Kathmandu would escalate into what is now described as Nepal’s gen Z revolution, which saw the toppling of the government within a day, the dissolution of parliament and appointment of a new interim prime minister, the anti-corruption hardliner Sushila Karki, by the end of the week. Bohora was outside the parliament building in Kathmandu on the morning of 8 September when he heard the sound of gunfire and felt pain in his left leg. As his friend carried him to the nearby hospital, his bloodied trainer was left behind amid the pandemonium. A photograph of the shoe later went viral, an evocative symbol of the deadliest day of protest in Nepal’s history, with 19 protesters killed.

Photograph: Prabin Ranabhat/AFP/Getty Images One month on, Bohora is still in hospital as doctors fight to save his leg. Sitting in the trauma ward, he expressed frustration at the what he saw as the slow pace of change for Nepal since the gen Z uprising, for which he paid such a heavy price. He was among those calling for the former prime minister KP Sharma Oli and the former home minister Ramesh Lekhak to be arrested for alleged corruption and their role in the shooting of protesters by police on 8 September. “It’s been a month since the movement began, yet many of our demands remain unmet,” Bohora said. Bohora had had been driven to protest in anger at a system that seemed to be making the politicians and their children wildly rich while he had faced unemployment and exploitation. Despite qualifying as a health assistant eight years ago, there was no work for Bohora in Nepal’s struggling job market and he eventually travelled to Russia for further studies. But after running out of money, he found himself coerced into joining the Russian army , fighting on the frontlines in the Ukrainian city of Donetsk. He saw friends killed and maimed. He finally escaped back to Nepal 18 months later. “I was lucky to return home alive,” Bohora said. “After coming back, I took to the streets hoping for a better country, free from corruption.” Many of the young people who took to the streets on 8 September say they simply wanted to raise their voice against corruption and never intended to bring about wholesale regime change – let alone be tasked with deciding the next prime minister and future of the country. Their movement had no single leader , no manifesto and no singular set of demands, and still largely remains that way. Even the decision to champion Karki, a former chief justice, as their choice of interim prime minister came after she emerged as a favourite in online discussions and polls held by thousands of gen Z protesters on the social media platform Discord. Nepal’s new interim prime minister, Sushila Karki, is an anti-corruption hardliner. The legitimacy of her government has been questioned by the country’s biggest political parties. Photograph: Monika Malla/Reuters With elections promised for March, Karki is under mounting pressure from gen Z groups to demonstrate that she will crack down on corruption as promised. Yet major bureaucratic obstacles remain in implementing large-scale reform, and the lack of any high-profile arrests of former ministers from Oli’s government is a growing bone of contention. “Right now, our main demand is to control corruption,” said Amit Khanal, 24, of the Gen-Z Movement Alliance. While there are no gen Z figures appointed to Karki’s cabinet yet, Khanal said they remained in close talks with the government. “This government was formed under special circumstances, and it must investigate the major corruption scandals, especially those involving former top leaders,” he said. “If no investigation is carried out, the entire purpose of this massive movement will be meaningless.” Om Prakash Aryal, whom Karki appointed as home minister, said one of the interim government’s first moves had been to “remove the obstructions and disconnect the political links” that had prevented the most powerful political figures from being investigated for corruption. “The environment is being created so the commission can accept complaints about anyone and investigate,” Aryal said. He emphasised that it would take time for authorities to carry out a full independent investigation into the decades of alleged graft, but added: “At the same time, there are things that must be acted on immediately. The government will not let impunity have room.” In the backdrop are growing efforts by Nepal’s biggest political parties – Nepali Congress, the Communists and the Maoists – to question the legitimacy of Karki’s interim government. After parliament was dissolved, all three parties released statements calling the move unconstitutional and dangerous. In a notable break from tradition, none attended Karki’s swearing-in ceremony. In an inflammatory speech this week, Oli accused Karki and the gen Z protesters of ulterior motives. “There is an attack on this country,” he said. “There is an attack on the sovereign power of this country. There is an attack on its territory. There is an attack on the country’s interests.” Analysts warned that the gulf between the interim government and the political parties could spell bad news for Nepal’s political stability and the success of its elections in March. Lok Raj Baral, a professor of political science and former ambassador to India, said that rather than casting blame, the gen Z uprising should be a moment of reckoning for Nepal’s political old guard. “This is an opportunity for old parties to correct themselves, to transfer leadership, to renew and regain their credibility,” he said. “The old leaders were busy fighting for their chairs. They should have now learned their lesson.” Quick Guide Contact us about this story Show The best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.

85fc1de188b5,Keir Starmer to look at India’s digital ID system during visit to Mumbai,,"Keir Starmer is to examine India’s digital ID system on his visit to Mumbai as a potential model for the UK, praising the system as a “massive success”. Speaking on his two-day trip to Mumbai, where he met an expert on India’s digital ID system, Starmer defended the introduction of a similar measure in the UK, saying he believed the rollout of a voluntary system could be expanded to school applications, mortgages and driving licences. Starmer met Nandan Nilekani, the non-exec chair of the tech company Infosys, to discuss the speed of the rollout in India and the transformation of the benefits system, which has cut bureaucracy – but also caused significant contention over the exclusion of some minorities. India’s version of the scheme – Aadhaar – has been introduced over the past 15 years to almost all of its 1.4bn citizens. Starmer’s spokesperson said the meeting was not about a potential commercial arrangement with Infosys, adding that the government aimed to build its own version of the scheme in the public sector. But his interest in the Indian scheme will be taken as another sign that the government hopes the ID scheme will be part of the UK benefits system in time. Speaking to reporters en route to Mumbai, Starmer said he hoped digital IDs, which have plummeted in popularity since his announcement, would regain public confidence because of the convenience they could provide. “I don’t know how many times the rest of you have had to look in the bottom drawer for three bills when you want to get your kids into school or apply for this or apply for that, drives me to frustration,” he said. “I do think that we could gain a significant advantage. We’re going to a country, India, where they’ve already done ID and made a massive success of it. So one of the meetings I’ll be having is about ID, in relation to that.” Keir Starmer speaks to the British high commissioner to India, Lindy Cameron, and the British deputy high commissioner for western India, Harjinder Kang, in Mumbai. Photograph: Leon Neal/Reuters The digital ID system in India is far more extensive than that announced by the UK government and holds biometric data as well as residential and contact information. Government sources said there was no intention to copy the system, but to examine the way it was used and implemented, handling 80m transactions a day. It is considered a success, albeit with controversial implications, with estimates it has saved the Indian economy about £11bn in administration and corruption costs. Citizens are given a 12-digit identifying number, which replaces the need for multiple layers of paper documentation to prove their status when they take out bank accounts or apply for state benefits. Prior to the scheme, millions of babies would routinely not be registered at birth, leaving people struggling to access benefits or ways to prove their existence later in life. Critics of the Indian scheme said it was introduced with little protection for personal data, and has caused problems among the poorest citizens, with some said to have been denied medical care or benefits for not having the ID. Phone companies and banks have in some instances threatened to shut down accounts not linked to ID numbers, though a supreme court ruling has said it should not be mandatory for private services or education. Activists have also reported it being used to disenfranchise Muslim voters in the north of the country. Starmer’s spokesperson said the meeting was held because it was “useful to hear from the Indian experience; it has a very different inception and a different system, but it is used 80m times a day”. Protesters gather near Downing Street to voice their opposition to the plans for digital IDs. Photograph: Dan Kitwood/Getty Images Asked about some of the controversies with the Indian system, he said the UK system would have a different design – there are no plans to use biometric data so far. “One of core priorities is inclusivity and that’s what the British consultation will be about,” he said. Starmer said the scheme was essential to tackle illegal working, as the ID would be mandatory for employment, but that he hoped it would become a voluntary convenience measure for most British citizens. skip past newsletter promotion Our morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it matters Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Rightwing parties have put the spotlight on gig economy companies such as UberEats and Deliveroo, where migrant workers have been able to use false identities to work. “We have to have returns agreements with countries, as we’ve got with France, and we need to address the fact that too many people can come to this country and work illegally,” Starmer said. “And that’s why ID mandatory for working is really important. “There is a case to be made about the benefits for voluntary ID into other areas, and obviously we need to make that case. I think it’s a really important discussion for us to have. So on the one hand, it’s mandatory for work, but I actually think it would be a good passport.” The government has not identified any private provider that can take part in the scheme, with the tech company Palantir saying it would not do so because the plan was not in the Labour manifesto and therefore had no mandate. All opposition parties have said they would oppose the scheme, and there remain significant misgivings among some Labour MPs about the possibility of snowballing costs and data breaches. Net support for digital ID cards fell from 35% in the early summer to -14% at the weekend after Starmer’s announcement, according to polling by More in Common.

The prime minister told a business delegation of more than 120 chief executives and cultural leaders that he hoped each one of them would have a deal to sign by the end of the trip. On a visit to a Bollywood production studio, Starmer announced three new Bollywood blockbusters would be made in the UK from next year by Yash Raj Films, creating more than 3,000 jobs. No 10 said deals signed during the trip would create about 7,000 jobs through Indian investment in the UK. Speaking at a visit to a football ground, Starmer denied business leaders had been pressing for liberalisation of visa rules. “None of them have raised with me the question of visas. That wasn’t part of the FTA (free trade agreement),” he said. “What this is about is providing opportunities for them to take advantage of the FTA, and even before it’s fully enforced, the mood is very, very strong between India and the UK.”",https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/oct/08/keir-starmer-india-digital-id-visit-mumbai,World,BBC,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/116950a317872360e58643c4079af16071a2c7d7/926_522_3453_2763/master/3453.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=9733965b9667ddda6a3170edf2ede5d0",2025-10-08T21:00:05+00:00,eaf49319adec7cea55c01b0de9a7a2c8f45a27ec
eaff1c250fb1,Paraglider bomb attack by Myanmar military kills at least 20 at protest,,"A Myanmar military operation that used a motorised paraglider to drop bombs on a village this week killed at least 20 people including children and injured dozens more, according to witnesses and local media. The attack hit Chaung U, in Sagaing region, during a national holiday. Myanmar has been engulfed in armed conflict since the military seized power in 2021 and the village has been a key battleground in the war. “I saw body parts [scattered] everywhere,” a resident told the Democratic Voice of Burma news service. Witnesses said it was hard to distinguish civilians from anti-junta fighters among those killed. The bombs were dropped from a paraglider fitted with a small engine, a low-tech and cheap weapon of a type that the Myanmar junta has increasingly deployed this year to intensify its aerial campaign against those opposing it. The victims were holding a sit-in protest against the military regime during a ceremony to celebrate the Thadingyut festival, the country’s biggest Buddhist holiday. A local resident who attended Monday’s ceremony told the Associated Press that people began to flee after hearing reports of an approaching paraglider but it arrived sooner than expected. The paraglider returned later the same evening to drop more explosives. Footage of the crowd’s desperate scramble to help the wounded and locate missing loved ones circulated on social media. Amnesty International said the attack underscored the need to protect Myanmar residents. “The international community may have forgotten about the conflict in Myanmar, but the Myanmar military is taking advantage of reduced scrutiny to carry out war crimes with impunity,” said Joe Freeman, Amnesty’s Myanmar researcher. The military has not acknowledged carrying out an attack in the area. Myanmar’s generals have been fighting a civil war that erupted after they seized power in February 2021 from the elected government of Aung San Suu Kyi. Much of the country, including the village where the attack took place, is under the control of armed opposition groups. The junta has declared elections for 28 December but a UN expert has dismissed the plan as a “fraud”. Anti-junta opposition groups are barred from running or are refusing to take part. Last month UN investigators released a report saying that the “frequency and brutality” of atrocities inside the country had continued to escalate, more than four years after the coup. The investigators said they had gathered significant evidence that there was systematic torture inside prison facilities, including beatings, electric shocks, strangulation, torture by pulling out fingernails with pliers, and forms of sexual violence, including rape and gang-rape.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/oct/08/paraglider-bomb-attack-by-myanmar-military-kills-people-at-protest,World,BBC,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ac31109fe8dab7a252ade97b322fbe8f5f523567/292_0_2917_2334/master/2917.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=b04ff232654ce74d0d5dcb0b6445fc6d",2025-10-08T13:38:29+00:00,01c13c265fe532856947719fd0e697928e0f7521
9c99023e335c,Mount Everest hikers describe ‘extreme’ conditions as huge rescue effort continues,,"Trekkers have described facing “extreme” conditions after an unseasonable snowstorm during one of China’s busiest holiday weekends stranded hundreds of people on Mount Everest , prompting a massive rescue effort. Chinese authorities said about 350 people had made their way down but at least 200 remained stranded at the Everest Scenic Area, to the east of the mountain, on the Tibetan side of the border. Crowds of tourists had travelled to the region for “Golden Week”, an eight-day holiday period in China. But Chinese authorities, which control the Tibetan Autonomous Region, said heavy snowfall had hit the area on Friday and Saturday night, trapping hundreds of people at campsites at an elevation of more than 4,900 metres (16,000ft). “It was the most extreme weather I’ve ever faced in all my hiking experiences, without question,” Dong Shuchang, a Chinese trekker, said on Weibo, describing a “violent convective snowstorm on the eastern slope” of Everest. “I looked up in the middle of the night and saw that the snow had nearly covered the top,” said another trekker on Xiaohongshu. “It was the first time I truly felt the fear of being buried alive.” One Chinese trekker said their group had been “too scared to sleep” on Saturday as snow quickly piled up around their tents, forcing them to clear it every 90 minutes. They decided to descend on Sunday as the weather worsened. “ On the way, we met our guide’s father, who had come looking for him. That’s when we learned the snow was heavy in the valley, too; villagers, unable to contact their children on the mountain, were extremely worried.” Map The northern and eastern side of Everest is more accessible than sites on the Nepal side of the border, and draws high numbers of visitors for less technical trekking, without summiting the peak. Photos and video posted online showed tents buried in snow, and lines of trekkers walking through waist-high drifts to get down the mountain. “The snow was very deep, and the trail extremely slippery. Trekkers stumbled frequently – some fell, others were bumped by yaks,” said one, who added that all safely descended and were picked up by bus. By Sunday afternoon, about 350 people had reached Qudang, a small town about 30 miles away from the Tibet-side base camp of Everest, “in good health”, state media reported. At least 200 more were still stranded, but had been contacted, the reports said. Jimu News reported that hundreds of rescuers had gone up the mountain to help people and clear snow from blocking the way out. There was little official reporting or updated information about the rescue effort on Monday. It was also not clear if the weather had affected anyone on the northern side of Everest, also in Tibet. The region is tightly controlled by the Chinese government, and journalistic access restricted. The weather also appears to have affected local communications, with calls to local businesses not connecting. Several trekkers said power was out in Qudang when they arrived. October is a peak season for the area, with usually clear and mild weather, but Chen Geshuang, one of 18 members of a trekking group that made it back to Qudang, said that the weather this year was “not normal”. “The guide said he had never encountered such weather in October. And it happened all too suddenly.” The local tourism authority said ticket sales and entry to the Everest Scenic Area were suspended from Saturday. Neighbouring countries were also hit by extreme weather. Heavy rains triggered landslides and flash floods that have blocked roads, washed away bridges and killed at least 47 people since Friday in Nepal.

5ee881316ef0,UK small businesses and charities say nuclear levy could add thousands to bills,,"British charities and small businesses have warned that a new levy on energy bills, intended to support the government’s nuclear power ambitions, could raise their costs by thousands of pounds a year. The extra charge could mean a significant cost hike for charities and small businesses with high energy use, meaning community services may be cut and economic growth curtailed, according to trade groups. For most charities, the levy, which takes effect in November, will mean an increase in costs of between £100 and £240 a year, but some could experience increases of up to £2,500, according to Social Investment Business, an organisation that offers loans and financial support to charities. Nick Temple, the chief executive of Social Investment Business, said: “Adding yet more charges on top of charity electricity bills penalises our most vital community spaces at a time when they are already struggling.” For small business, including those in hospitality, the extra costs could undermine growth in the UK economy and make the shift from fossil fuels to low-carbon electricity more expensive, according to trade associations. The levy is designed to pay back investors in the Sizewell C nuclear project in Suffolk while the power plant is under construction. Households can expect the levy to add about £12 a year to their energy bills, but organisations with high energy use will shoulder a greater cost burden. This will have a disproportionate impact on smaller businesses and charities with high energy demands because energy intensive industries such as steel, cement and glass-making have been granted exemption. A Bristol-based community arts organisation, Spike Island , has been told to expect a hike of £1,ooo a year from the nuclear levy alone. The company, which provides subsidised studios for underrepresented artists, expects the extra costs to put a strain on its work. Kate Ward, the deputy director at Spike Island, said the rise in electricity costs would prevent the charity from switching to low-carbon heating, such as heat pumps, while increasing its overall running costs and putting its work with artists at risk. “The government needs to rethink how they approach electricity bills to make it viable for more charities and small businesses to make the right decisions for the planet,” Ward said. Business groups have also said that the costs are a “huge concern” for smaller companies, which they say will be forced to carry a disproportionate cost burden because larger companies were given exemptions. Craig Beaumont, the executive director of the Federation of Small Businesses (FSB), said: “Small businesses are already feeling the strain from increasing utility bills, with many saying it’s now holding back their growth. Further increases to non-commodity costs will only add to this pressure. “The government is protecting high-intensity users against these hikes, but as a result small firms’ bills are due to shoot up. This is in effect a cross-subsidy. Local small businesses should not shoulder such a high proportion of the costs themselves.” Kate Nicholls, the chair of the trade body UKHospitality, said: “This is yet another example of hospitality businesses subsidising other sectors. It’s not just the nuclear levy, but also the energy discounts for large, energy-intensive manufacturers, which will be offset by higher bills for community pubs and neighbourhood restaurants. “The constant focus on the needs of the industrial strategy sectors is having real-world impacts for the other 70% of the economy. Adding yet another cost on to hospitality businesses will only put further pressures on prices at the bar, which will fuel inflation.” A government spokesperson said: “Thriving small businesses and charities are at the heart of our communities, which is why we have extended business rates relief, supporting economic growth across the country and support for those who need it most. “The only way to bring down energy bills for good is with the government’s clean energy superpower mission , which will also secure thousands of good, skilled jobs and billions in investment.”",https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/oct/12/uk-small-businesses-and-charities-say-nuclear-levy-could-add-thousands-to-bills,World,BBC,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fc5d48038b2acebba2cd8cca95e687c593a615ed/300_0_1500_1200/master/1500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=542a931edc19361103971e2ed5ee6fb7",2025-10-12T15:29:53+00:00,f869fec3cc0451f920ad35d090d3e559b2503440
f413308774f8,Prince Andrew told Jeffrey Epstein ‘we’re in this together’ in 2011 email,,"Prince Andrew told Jeffrey Epstein in an email “we are in this together” after a picture of the British royal with his arm around a teenage Virginia Giuffre was first published in 2011. The email will pile further pressure on the Duke of York and the royal family because he previously told the BBC he had ceased contact with the convicted child sex offender by that point. Correspondence between the king’s younger brother and Epstein, published in the Mail on Sunday and the Sun on Sunday, appears to show that was not the case. Andrew emailed Epstein on 28 February 2011, the day after the well-known photograph of the duke, Giuffre and Ghislaine Maxwell was made public. He told Epstein to “keep in close touch” and expressed a wish to “play some more soon”. In 2019, Andrew told the BBC’s Newsnight programme that he broke off his friendship with Epstein in December 2010, after the two men were photographed together strolling in New York. But he wrote to Epstein in the message after the photo was published: “I’m just as concerned for you! Don’t worry about me! It would seem we are in this together and will have to rise above it. Otherwise keep in close touch and we’ll play some more soon!!!!” He is said to have signed off with: “A, HRH The Duke of York, KG.” Epstein was found dead in his cell at a federal jail in Manhattan in August 2019 while he awaited trial on sex trafficking charges. The death was ruled a suicide. In 2008 he pleaded guilty to charges of solicitation of prostitution and of solicitation of prostitution with a minor, for which he served time in jail. In January this year, a section of the email from the Duke of York emerged in court documents. At the time it was reported to be from a “royal family member”. It related to a claim made by the Financial Conduct Authority, the UK banking regulator, and appeared in court documents for a legal case involving the former Barclays chief executive Jes Staley. Staley was appealing against a finding by the watchdog that he had given a misleading account of the nature of his relationship with Epstein. In a November 2019 interview with Newsnight, Andrew told the journalist Emily Maitlis: “I ceased contact with him [Epstein] after I was aware that he was under investigation and that was later in 2006 and I wasn’t in touch with him again until 2010.” He later said that in December 2010 “I had to show leadership and I had to go and see him and I had to tell him ‘that’s it’.” Buckingham Palace and the Duke of York’s office have been contacted for comment. Also this weekend, it emerged that Tony Blair met Epstein in Downing Street while he was prime minister after a recommendation by Peter Mandelson, who last month was sacked as US ambassador after new information emerged about how close he had been to the convicted child sex offender. Blair’s meeting emerged in papers released at the National Archives and predated Epstein’s criminal conviction. Epstein visited Blair on 14 May 2002. Mandelson was then a backbench Labour MP, having resigned from government for a second time amid controversy . He had described Epstein to Blair’s chief of staff, Jonathan Powell, now the UK national security adviser, as “safe” and a “friend” in an email before the meeting.",https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/oct/12/prince-andrew-told-jeffrey-epstein-were-in-this-together-in-2011-email,World,BBC,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ac0a66808c4ec3c978ee1afc0e8e5ad50109ca57/496_61_2052_1641/master/2052.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=e0bf634144eae5d9ec9fdd49505484f3",2025-10-12T14:29:33+00:00,6bfec4ea3c0580694428ba77cd064fdf8165b993
fae0a849c1fa,"Trump ‘looking at all options’ amid threats to invoke Insurrection Act, Vance says",,"The White House is talking about invoking the Insurrection Act that would allow the deployment of military troops on US soil to quell domestic unrest amid legal challenges over the moves, JD Vance confirmed on Sunday. Vance was asked on NBC News’s Meet the Press whether Donald Trump was seriously considering invoking the emergency power to deploy national guard forces and even the US military in domestic settings. “The president’s looking at all of his options,” he said, adding that “we are talking about this because crime has gotten out of control in our cities”. Trump’s attempts to use federal national guard forces in Democratic-run cities has faced challenges in the courts, most notably in Chicago in recent days. The vice-president’s ominous remarks came days after Trump referred to the Insurrection Act from the Oval Office, bluntly stating : “If I had to enact it, I would do that.” Military forces are forbidden from engaging in law enforcement duties on home soil. But under the Insurrection Act , which was signed in 1807, the president can deploy them domestically in cases of insurrection or rebellion, violence that is preventing the functioning of federal laws. The power was used during the 1960s civil rights movement during clashes over desegregation of the south but since then has been very rarely activated. The last time a president called on it was in 1992 when the governor of California requested military aid from George HW Bush in response to civil unrest in Los Angeles. In Sunday’s Meet the Press interview, Vance said Trump “hasn’t felt he needed to” invoke the Insurrection Act up to this point. But he confirmed that it was among the tactics being considered as the administration continues to be stymied in federal courts from deploying federalised national guard forces in Democratic-run cities . Federal courts have blocked the White House from using troops in Oregon and Illinois. On Thursday a federal judge prohibited the deployment of federalised national guard personnel in Chicago, admonishing the administration that she had “seen no credible evidence that there is a danger of a rebellion in the state of Illinois”. National guard troops have been sent into Illinois by the Trump administration from both Texas and California but under the temporary court order cannot be put out into the streets. Vance told NBC News that options such as the Insurrection Act were being considered because “there are places in Chicago where people are afraid to take their children … for fear of gun violence, for fear of gang drive-by shootings”. In a separate interview with This Week on ABC News, Vance said that Chicago had been given over to “lawlessness and gangs” and had a murder rate “that rivals the worst places in the third world”. In fact, violent crime has been falling at unprecedented rates in America’s biggest cities including Chicago over the past two years. Chicago is not in the top four large US cities with the highest murder rates – all of whom are in states controlled by Republicans. As Vance did the rounds of Sunday’s political talkshows, tension between the Trump administration and the Democratic states it is targeting exploded across TV screens. The vice-president was repeatedly asked by George Stephanopoulos on ABC News whether the Democratic governor of Illinois, JB Pritzker, had committed a crime that could see him being prosecuted by the Department of Justice as have several other of Trump’s “political enemies”. Vance skirted the question until he was pressed into saying: “He should suffer consequences. Whether he has violated a crime I would leave to the courts, but he has certainly violated his oath of office and that seems pretty criminal to me.” Pritzker responded to the veiled threat by accusing Vance of coming out with a “tidal wave of lies”. The governor told This Week that he was not intimidated by the prospect of prosecution as has befallen the former FBI director James Comey and the New York attorney general Letitia James , who have both been indicted in recent days. Pritzker said: “I am not afraid. Do I think he could do it? He might. But as I have said before, come and get me. I mean, you’re dead wrong, Mr President and Mr Vice-President, and I will stand up for the law and the constitution.” Raw emotions were widely on display across the TV studios as the federal government shutdown entered day 12. The Republican House speaker, Mike Johnson , told Fox News Sunday that the crisis had been orchestrated by Democratic leaders in Congress as a partisan move “so that they can prove to their Marxist base that they are willing to fight Trump”. He said that after eight attempts to reopen the government had all failed in votes in the Senate, the shutdown was causing “real pain for real people – and the Democrats don’t seem to care”. On the same program, the House minority leader, Hakeem Jeffries, denied that the Democratic stance was partisan. “We will sit down with anyone, any time, any place, go back to the White House, to have a bipartisan discussion about reopening the government,” he said. The Democrats’ aim, Jeffries added, was to “improve the quality of life of the American people and address the healthcare crisis that threatens tens of millions of people across the country”.",https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/12/trump-vance-insurrection-act-military,World,BBC,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9e3d13c398ed2344b76f5e8db12a6cc1448c4dfb/599_0_6880_5504/master/6880.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=e85daefd2ea6beab1991805327045e5d",2025-10-12T18:07:36+00:00,2fc5c9206c6941375cb3d6dbab595fe40ad406ad
c89fc0317d9b,Former NFL star Mark Sanchez ‘focused on recovery’ after jail appearance over stabbing incident,,"Former NFL star Mark Sanchez says he is “focused on my recovery” after being booked and released from jail over an incident last weekend during which he was stabbed and another man was left with significant injuries. Sanchez was processed at Marion County Jail on Sunday after his release from hospital. A judge ruled Sanchez had to undergo the processing before he is allowed to leave Indiana. “I am just focused on my recovery and I want to thank the first responders,” Sanchez told CBS/Fox Indianapolis journalist Max Lewis outside Marion County Jail. The 38-year-old then appeared to grow emotional as he thanked the surgeon who operated on him “she saved my life … I’m grateful for that”. Asked about the injuries to his torso that he suffered during the incident, the former New York Jets quarterback said: “I’m recovering slowly, it’s a long process”. Sanchez faces a felony battery charge over the incident last weekend. Sanchez, who was in Indianapolis to cover the Colts game with the Raiders for Fox Sports, was involved in a confrontation with a 69-year-old truck driver, Perry Tole, in the early hours of Saturday morning. Tole, who was left with a deep laceration to his face, said he feared for his life during the incident and pepper sprayed and stabbed Sanchez. Police say the incident happened after a dispute over a parking space. Sanchez could face up to six years in jail if he is found guilty of the battery charge. He is due to attend a court hearing on 5 November. Tole has also filed a lawsuit against Sanchez, with his lawyers saying their client suffered “severe permanent disfigurement, loss of function” and emotional distress. Sanchez has pleaded not guilty to the charges against him, which also include battery with injury, public intoxication and unlawful entry of a vehicle. Fox Sports has yet to address Sanchez’s long-term future with the broadcaster. The Jets picked Sanchez with the fifth overall selection in the 2009 NFL draft after he enjoyed a successful college career in his native California. He led the Jets to two AFC Championship games before spells with several teams, including the Philadelphia Eagles and Dallas Cowboys. He announced his retirement from the NFL in 2019 and soon after began working with ESPN’s college football coverage before transitioning to Fox.",https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/oct/12/mark-sanchez-nfl-stabbing-incident-hospital,World,BBC,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/45519f5ed03bfaf2238291b8053b47d36221ca82/0_172_5993_4796/master/5993.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=46e068908378f1fca24272708a270e7a",2025-10-12T17:18:32+00:00,7fcc81468e7777f72d13541e683c44694f8bda9b

The shooting occurred early Sunday at Willie’s Bar and Grill on St Helena island, officials said. A large crowd was at the scene when sheriff’s deputies arrived and found several people suffering from gunshot wounds. “Multiple victims and witnesses ran to the nearby businesses and properties seeking shelter from the gun shots,” the Beaufort county sheriff’s office said in a statement on the social media platform X. “This is a tragic and difficult incident for everyone. We ask for your patience as we continue to investigate this incident. Our thoughts are with all of the victims and their loved ones,” the statement said. Four people were found dead at the scene, and at least 20 other people were injured. Among the injured, four were in critical condition at area hospitals. The victims’ identities were not released. “COMPLETELY HEARTBROKEN to learn about the devastating shooting in Beaufort County,” US Representative Nancy Mace posted on X. “Our prayers are with the victims, their families, and everyone impacted by this horrific act of violence.” St Helena island is known as an epicenter of a culture of people descended from African slaves known as Gullah Geechee.

Heavy rain also was forecast for south-east New England, the New York City area, and some has fallen in coastal sections of South Carolina , Oravec said. In North Carolina’s Outer Banks, an area that has seen significant storm damage this season, ocean overwash was starting to come across highway 12 at a motel near Buxton, the Dare county sheriff’s office posted online Sunday. The office urged travelers to be cautious and put property owners on alert as high tide approached. All of New Jersey has been under a state of emergency since Saturday night. It is expected to last into Monday, authorizing the state’s emergency services personnel to be activated as necessary. Parts of the state are forecast to experience moderate to major coastal flooding, inland flash flooding, winds up to 60mph (97kph), up to 5in (about 13cm) of rain and high surf, potentially causing beach erosion. Some volunteers were putting sandbags at beaches. The National Weather Service placed New York City, Long Island and southern Westchester county under a coastal flood warning and wind advisory through at least Monday afternoon. Coastal areas of suburban Long Island could see flooding, with up to 3in (about 8cm ) of rain and lashing winds expected, the weather service said. Wind gusts of more than 30mph (48kph) were already being recorded in the region on Sunday morning. Utilities in the area have added more than 1,600 workers to respond to the storm. “With high wind warnings and flood risks, staying alert, vigilant and taking steps to prepare is crucial for everyone’s safety,” the New York governor, Kathy Hochul, said in a statement.

e729d49ea113,Maga figures back Bukele’s call for Trump to crack down on US judges,,"Donald Trump is not known for taking advice, especially from foreign leaders who often seek to flatter and compliment the US president. But El Salvador’s authoritarian leader Nayib Bukele has followed a different tack by calling on the Trump administration to follow his example in impeaching “corrupt judges”. His call for Trump to take action against the US judiciary also received support from Maga figures, including an X post by one-time close Trump ally Elon Musk , who has in the past boosted Bukele’s calls to impeach US judges. Experts say Bukele’s latest intervention comes at a time of unprecedented threats to judicial independence and individual judges in the US, and in a period where the Trump administration is employing the same authoritarian tactics used by authoritarians in countries such as Turkey, Hungary, India and Bukele’s own El Salvador to subvert democratic accountability. Bukele’s online call last week was just the latest in a long series of taunts and allegations he has made against the US’s legal system, including a March claim that the US was “facing a judicial coup”, and his mockery of a federal judge’s order to halt deportation flights sending accused illegal immigrants to his country’s brutal prison system. Bukele’s impeachment call was also made amid social media attacks on Oregon federal judge Karin Immergut by presidential advisor Stephen Miller, attorney general Pam Bondi, Musk, and Trump himself in a recent press gaggle. Immergut had issued restraining orders preventing Trump from mobilizing the national guard, first in Oregon then in California. Trump has been gunning to send troops into Portland, which the president has characterized as “war-ravaged” on the basis of small, non-violent protests outside the city’s homeland security facility. Miller , Bondi and Musk have a long record of attacking judges who have ruled against Trump’s executive orders or otherwise impeded the administration’s political agenda. Before resuming office this year, Trump directed his followers against judges presiding over his civil and criminal trials, who were then deluged with threats and harassment . Monitoring groups, law enforcement agencies and judges themselves have pointed to a heightened atmosphere of threats and intimidation in the months since he re-entered the White House. According to data gathered by the US Marshals Service , in 2025 through to the end of September, there were 562 threats to 395 federal judges, giving rise to 805 investigations. 2025 has already eclipsed 2022, the first year of published records, and 2024, and is on track to exceed 2023’s record of 630 threats made. The threats are not just happening at the federal level. Data from Princeton’s Bridging Divides Initiative indicates that there have been at least 59 instances of threats, harassment, stalking, or violence committed against judges on the local level in 2025. Experts say that the threats are a product of the rhetoric coming from senior administration figures. In May, the Global Project Against Hate and Extremism (GPAHE) published a detailed report alleging that “malicious and highly irresponsible statements from Trump administration members and allies coincide with escalating violent posts on social media”. It recorded “a 54% increase in calls for impeachment and violent threats against judges across social media platforms from January to February 2025, the first full month of Trump’s administration”. Heidi Beirich, the co-founder of GPAHE, said: “Trump’s threats against judges have definitely driven online vitriol at judges and calls for impeachment. Targeting the judiciary is one more step in Trump’s march towards authoritarianism.” That march towards authoritarianism has been well-trodden in recent years in several countries, including by Bukele. In 2021, immediately after commencing a second term in the face of constitutional prohibitions , Bukele’s parliamentary loyalists voted to dismiss the country’s attorney general and five justices on the constitutional court . The judges, who had provoked his ire by ruling against coronavirus measures, made way for replacements hand picked by Bukele. The move echoed Viktor Orbán’s remodeling of Hungary’s court system in 2018 ; Recep Tayyip Erdoğan’s judicial purges in 2019 ; and attempts at similar moves in Israel and Poland . Experts say that the threats and rhetorical attacks in the US can be seen as attempts to undermine judicial independence in a system that offers no easy way for the executive to dismiss judges Trump disapproves of. Meghan Leonard, an associate professor at Illinois State University who has researched authoritarian backsliding in democracies, said the Trump administration had learned from the examples set by authoritarians overseas. “The administration is looking around at these successes and failures. They know they’re not going to be able to pass any legislation that would weaken the judiciary,” she said. Pointing to examples such as Miller’s relentless assertions of nearly limitless presidential authority, she added: “They directly attack the judiciary by repeating over and over that it is not a co-equal branch in the separation of powers. “They continue to reframe the debate by repeating their claim that the president has more power than this other co-equal branch, which is not how separation powers work.” Leonard said: “Judges’ only protection is people’s belief in the legitimacy of their ability to make those decisions. Individual threats on top of weakening institutional legitimacy may make judges think twice about decisions that go against the current administration, which is, of course, massively problematic for judicial review and for democracy.” Kim Lane Scheppele, professor of sociology and international affairs at Princeton University, has written about the use of “ autocratic legalism “ by the likes of Orbán and Putin, and has spoken out about escalating threats to judges in the US. She pointed to a wave of so-called “ pizza doxxings “ this year, in which judges have received unsolicited pizza deliveries with the recipient listed as Daniel Anderl, the son of Judge Esther Salas, who was killed at the judge’s home in 2020 by a gunman targeting Salas. “Everyone understands what it means. ‘We know where you live. ‘We’re coming for you,’” Scheppele said. “Federal judges are protected by the Secret Service and the Marshals Service. And those are both specialized police units that sit institutionally inside the Department of Justice. And Pam Bondi has been leading the attacks on federal judges” On the administration’s aims, Scheppele said that “impeaching a federal judge is almost certainly not going to happen because it’s so hard to do. Right now, I don’t think that the desire of the Trump administration is to remove the judges via impeachment. It is to scare the judges enough to get some of them to think twice about ruling against the administration.” She said: “Bukele knows how to play that game. He’s very skilled at it. I’m not surprised that he’s annotating the US crisis and cheering on Trump. He knows that Trump lives online; he’s also currying favor.” Beirich said: “It’s not surprising that someone like Bukele would do this, or Hungary’s Orbán, given their autocratic behavior. But an American president supposedly supportive of democracy should know better.”",https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/12/trump-bukele-judges,World,BBC,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0aed08a05f4e9525b9b5cd5a0a7e081287048f6b/463_0_4608_3689/master/4608.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=7ae009ba6be6acc9ff7b7171cd84ad5e",2025-10-12T12:00:53+00:00,45dffc100601350c8d5cabc5b4908481101c0da9
660e209bae58,The IMF boss is right to say ‘buckle up’ – the global economy is facing multiple menaces,,"L ittle more than 48 hours passed last week between a warning from the IMF chief, Kristalina Georgieva, that “uncertainty is the new normal” and Donald Trump’s latest tariff onslaught – this time aimed at China. Markets plunged on Friday after Trump threatened to levy punitive additional tariffs of 100% on Chinese goods in retaliation for Beijing’s blocks on exports of rare earth minerals. The world’s finance ministers and central bankers will meet in Washington this week for the annual meetings of the IMF and World Bank . In her curtain-raiser speech for the gathering, Georgieva rightly pointed out the global economy has proved more resilient than some feared at the time of the spring meetings in April, when the world’s policymakers were transfixed by the chaos emanating from the White House. Part of the reason for that has been “front loading”: Trump’s intention to jack up tariffs was no secret, and many companies ran up inventories in advance and started to rejig their supply chains. Another explanation is that the US’s trading partners have in general preferred to use a combination of flattery and capitulation in the face of Trump’s approach, rather than causing an all-out trade war. Meanwhile, firms and governments have increasingly been forging new trade connections that bypass the US, creating what Adam Posen, the director of the Washington-based Peterson Institute for International Economics , has called a “new economic geography”. There was evidence of this in the latest update from the UN’s trade and development arm, Unctad, last week. “Trade growth remained positive in the first half of 2025, despite rising trade policy uncertainty, persistent geopolitical tensions and a challenging global economic environment,” Unctad reported. Far from grinding to a halt, global trade expanded by more than $500bn (£375bn) in the first half of the year and was expected to continue growing in the third quarter, with much of the momentum coming from developing countries. Adding to the sense of shifting tectonic plates, Unctad highlighted the continued prevalence of “friendshoring” – the phrase coined by the former Federal Reserve governor Janet Yellen to describe trading with trusted geopolitical allies. The impact of tariffs on the US economy also appears to have been less dramatic than first feared – though with policy continuing to change by the week, the full effects have likely not yet reached American consumers. Yet Friday’s furore was a reminder that, as Georgieva argued, there are still reasons to be fearful – or as she put it: “Global resilience has not yet been fully tested. And there are worrying signs the test may come.” As the new row with China shows, Trump is continuing to wield tariffs as a weapon, creating fresh shocks in financial markets. The impact has been especially tough in developing countries, some of which, as Unctad pointed out, have faced some of the highest tariffs. Away from trade policy, the White House continues to pursue unfunded tax cuts and trash the economic institutions usually considered the cornerstones of credibility – including the Federal Reserve. Over time, that must surely undermine market confidence, including in US Treasuries (government bonds) – an important benchmark against which assets in global markets are valued. There is little sign of that yet; but once lost, economic credibility is hard to rebuild. Part of the reason markets have not responded more skittishly to this and other concerns is that the economic picture is being flattered by another extraordinary and unpredictable phenomenon: the AI boom. skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Business Today Get set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morning Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

A wall of funding continues to pour into the tech industry as investors bet on the future of generative AI and battle to build the massive datacentres required to train and run the models . Data from the World Trade Organization last week showed that a full 20% of the growth in global goods trade in the first half of the year was accounted for by “AI-related goods – including semiconductors, servers, and telecommunications equipment”, much of it flowing from Asia to the US. As Ben May of Oxford Economics said recently: “The surge in US capital spending to develop AI capability has been masking weakness in other parts of the domestic economy.” However, a growing number of observers have begun to fret that generative AI may not deliver the extraordinary gains that would justify Wall Street valuations of the tech companies. And the increasingly complex web of cross-shareholdings between some of the key firms involved has raised eyebrows . The Bank of England last week became the latest body to warn about the risk of a “sudden correction” in global markets if the AI boom goes into reverse. “On a number of measures, equity market valuations appear stretched, particularly for technology companies focused on artificial intelligence. This … leaves equity markets particularly exposed should expectations around the impact of AI become less optimistic,” it said. Georgieva echoed that caution, comparing the AI boom to the dotcom bubble around the turn of the millennium. “Today’s valuations are heading toward levels we saw during the bullishness about the internet 25 years ago,” she warned, raising the spectre of a “sharp correction”. The dollar and dollar-denominated assets remain the lifeblood of much of global finance, despite efforts since the financial crisis to build up the importance of other currencies – so an AI crash would reverberate worldwide. Perhaps it is fitting that Trump has unleashed a new round of destabilising threats just as policymakers fly into town to take the temperature of the world economy. It certainly drove home Georgieva’s central message to them: “Buckle up.”",https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/oct/12/the-imf-boss-is-right-to-say-buckle-up-the-global-economy-is-facing-multiple-menaces,Business,BBC,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b303a4c83ff3c979daada3a3a2b3286728484d1e/497_0_2880_2304/master/2880.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=7c0080b9fdc3b9a7b09ea414229654fc",2025-10-12T09:52:42+00:00,a5733e99eaa6a8fec614098b0a0520d0af2c8ff7
57caa9e21f76,"What is the new EU border system EES, and how will it work?",,"The system means most non-EU citizens will have to register their biometric information at the border. Travellers’ faces will have to be photographed and fingerprints scanned before they are allowed into Europe’s Schengen area. The system will eventually replace passports being stamped by border officials. What is EES? It is not a replacement for passport control. Travellers will still have to go through checks with border officials at ports. But eventually they will not have their passport stamped – instead, countries in the Schengen area will log travellers’ faces, fingerprints, and entry and exit dates. The system is being introduced to make border crossing faster and more efficient, while also tracking who is coming in and out. The EU says it will also give it information that will be used for security purposes. This is the start of a phased introduction of the system. It is scheduled to be fully in place by 10 April 2026. Where does it apply and to whom? The EES applies to the Schengen area, which comprises 25 of the 27 EU member states as well as Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland. It includes countries where British people travel to frequently for holidays such as Spain, France, Portugal, Greece and Italy. The Republic of Ireland and Cyprus are not part of the Schengen area and so will continue to process passports as before. The EES applies to people who are not from an EU country or from Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland – although there are some exceptions such as people who have long-stay visas, among others. How does it work? When someone arrives at the border for the first time after the EES is in place, they will use a self-service screen to register their name, passport details, fingerprints, and the date and place of entry and exit. The machine will photograph their face. Children under 12 will not have their fingerprints scanned. When people first come into contact with the EES depends on where they are travelling to and when. Coach and foot passengers going through the port of Dover will go through a new facility for EES processing from Sunday. From November, this will apply to all traffic. Coach passengers going through the Eurotunnel will also go through the checks from Sunday. The process will be rolled out gradually over the coming months on Eurostar, which has installed registration terminals at its departure areas at St Pancras International in London. For other trips the process will happen when travellers get to the destination country. Airports are implementing the changes at different times. For example, Germany will phase in the service starting with a small airport in Stuttgart and then build up to operations in Frankfurt, one of the busiest aviation hubs in Europe. Will I have to get to Dover earlier? There have been concerns that the extra time it takes to process the EES data will lead to delays. However, the port of Dover has asked coach drivers not to arrive at the port any more than two hours before travel. Eurostar has said that the time it will take for the process can be squeezed into the current 75-minute window passengers are asked to spend at the station before departure. And the chief executive of Eurotunnel, Yann Leriche, has said the company is fully prepared and does not expect lengthy queues. Border officials have been told they have discretion to suspend EES if queues are building. What will happen to the data that is collected? The data provided digitally through the EES will kept for three years, with some exceptions, after which it is erased. It can be used by border, visa and immigration authorities in the countries using the system as well as local police and Europol, the EU agency for law enforcement. The EU says that the information may be transferred to another country, outside Schengen, or an international organisation, such as a UN body, under “strict conditions”. If travellers cross the border again, within the three-year period, the process should be quicker as the face picture and fingerprints will already be on file. If a person refuses to provide a picture or have their fingerprints taken then they will be refused entry , the EU says.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/oct/12/new-eu-new-border-system-ees-delays,Business,BBC,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6e4c60e5dfa5da80d0c21f577ec7ccd958349ad1/253_0_3779_3024/master/3779.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=e979dabbcddd298243909e154dce2302",2025-10-12T04:00:41+00:00,b360ad98945ddf2db9d9e898bd7866f746614e2b
5b7e73487506,Urgent calls for debt relief as study shows health and education cuts in developing world,,"Top economists are demanding urgent action on debt relief in Washington this week, as analysis from the campaign group Debt Justice shows struggling governments are cutting back on health and education. As finance ministers and central bankers gather for the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and World Bank annual meetings, influential experts including the Nobel laureate Joseph Stiglitz, and leading economists Mariana Mazzucato and Jayati Ghosh, are urging them to “turn debt into hope”. They are calling for the urgent replenishment of the IMF and World Bank’s debt relief funds, and changes to the way the institutions work, to ensure more countries can receive debt cancellation . “Bold action on debt means more children in classrooms, more nurses in hospitals, more action on climate change, more jobs, more trade, and less need for aid,” they say in a letter to global policymakers published on Sunday . The signatories, who have been involved in producing important recent reports on debt relief, including for the UN secretary general and the pope , said African governments spend an average of 17% of their revenues on servicing debts. “A cap of 10% in 21 countries could unlock enough money to provide clean water and sanitation to roughly 10 million people, as well as avert roughly 23,000 under-5 deaths each year,” they argue. Other signatories to the letter include the former South African finance minister Trevor Manuel, and former Italian prime minister Paulo Gentiloni. Analysis by the UK-based Debt Justice shows declining health and education spending in countries whose debts the IMF considers to be “sustainable”. Debt Justice looked at a group of 11 countries, including Sierra Leone, Mozambique, Kenya and Pakistan, which have long-term IMF programmes, and where the Washington-based lender classifies them as at risk of not being able to repay – but that do not qualify for debt relief. The research finds that over the course of their IMF programmes, health spending per person in this group of countries has been cut by 18% on average in real terms with education spending reduced by 10%. Heidi Chow, the executive director of Debt Justice, said: “By denying debt relief for countries that need it, the IMF is acting as a debt collector for rich and powerful creditors, while harming millions of people in debtor countries. Forcing countries to pay debts in full is leading to deepening crises in health, education and vital public services.” skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Business Today Get set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morning Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

In 2026, the G20 chair will pass to Donald Trump.

5efcbe2ba148,‘Using us as political pawns’: federal workers reel over threats of firings and withheld back pay,,"W ith no end of the federal government shutdown in sight, an estimated 750,000 workers remain furloughed. Hundreds of thousands more are working without pay. They are being “held hostage by a political dispute”, according to union leaders, as Republicans and Democrats remain deadlocked. In the Oval Office on Tuesday, Donald Trump suggested that furloughed employees would not necessarily receive back pay – despite a legal guarantee – prompting further unease throughout the federal workforce. “There are some people that don’t deserve to be taken care of, and we’ll take care of them in a different way,” the US president said. The administration, meanwhile, continues to threaten mass firings if Democrats stand by their demands. “If this keeps going on, it’ll be substantial,” Trump told reporters. “And a lot of those jobs will never come back.” On Friday, Russell Vought, the White House office of management and budget (OMB) director, announced on social media that layoffs had begun. Several federal agencies started announcing layoffs , but details remained scant on how many workers would be impacted. After a brutal year for the federal workforce , employees who spoke to the Guardian expressed growing anxiety over their pay – and the future of their jobs. “This is the third time I’ve been furloughed in my federal career,” said Priscilla Novak, a furloughed federal employee researcher. “But this is the first time there were threats of having people be fired en masse. I’ve been checking my email every day to see if I’m fired yet.” “Even before the shutdown, it’s just kind of been one thing after another for us,” said Peter Farruggia, a furloughed employee at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). “I think a lot of us are expecting the worst, hoping for the best.” “Not knowing when my next paycheck is going to get here is definitely very daunting,” Farruggia, also executive committee chair of AFGE Local 2883, which represents CDC workers, added. “But at least I paid rent this month, so that was probably the most important thing. If some of my other bills go by the wayside, then it is what it is, and I don’t really have any other options to seek out.” “What I’m hearing is a lot of anxiety, confusion, and chaos,” said Brent Barron, a US Department of Labor employee who serves as president of the National Council of Field Labor Locals, which represents workers at the department outside Washington DC. Some staffers don’t even know whether they’re furloughed or not, he claimed, let alone “whether or not they’re going to continue to have a job” for much longer. “There are a lot of employees out there that can’t even miss one check, let alone have this thing drag on for weeks and weeks and weeks,” said Barron. About three-quarters of the labor department has been furloughed. “All we want to do is do our jobs.” A law signed by Trump during his first term, the Government Employee Fair Treatment Act, guarantees all federal workers receive retroactive back pay once a government shutdown is over. “It really baffles me that this administration can just flaunt whatever law and say they don’t have to follow it,” said Barron. “This is a law that was passed in 2019 by Congress and signed by the president. And we all know who was president in 2019.” Trump officials are now facing calls to clarify that the federal government will follow the law, and ensure that every furloughed employee receives back pay. “Given the clarity of the law, there is no place for the Administration to backpedal on its obligation to pay furloughed workers,” labor unions and Democracy Defenders Fund, a watchdog group, wrote to the OMB on Wednesday. “The Administration’s statements appear to be a naked attempt at inflicting pain on innocent parties to gain advantage in the shutdown.” OMB is led by Vought, an architect of the rightwing Project 2025 blueprint. In a private speech in 2023 , Vought spoke of wanting to put officials “through trauma” to reduce the capacity of the federal government. “When they wake up in the morning, we want them to not want to go to work.” As the administration continues to threaten mass layoffs, raising the prospect of further cuts beyond the 300,000 federal employees set to be removed from the government by the end of this year through firings and attrition programs , officials have also been ordered by a federal judge to provide specifics on the status of any layoff plans, the agencies affected, and whether any federal employees have been recalled to work to carry out reductions in force. “The American people and the workers who keep this country running are being held hostage by a political dispute, by a petty political dispute that they have nothing to do with,” Greg Regan, president of the AFL-CIO’s transportation trades department, said during a press conference this week. “This is entirely vindictive and the only victims are going to be this country. “We’ve all seen the reports every single time we go through this stupid process of a shutdown, how much the American taxpayers lost. It’s a drain on our economy. It’s a drain on our safety. It’s a drain on the people that live here. So we need to put this to an end.” ‘People cannot focus on their jobs’ Almost all Transportation Security Administration (TSA) employees are required to work without pay during shutdowns, in a bid to minimize the threat of disruptions at key travel hubs like airports. The uncertainty has been particularly unnerving for newer, lower-paid employees, according to Cameron Cochems, a lead TSA officer and vice-president for AFGE Local 1127, which represents the administration’s employees in Idaho. Workers are worried about when they start missing paychecks, he said, adding that several have asked where to get low interest loans to float them through missed paychecks. “It feels kind of like there’s just a train coming and you can hear the whistle blowing, but every day it gets a little closer and closer to us,” Cochems told the Guardian. “And right now we can barely hear the whistle because we’re still focused on our jobs, we’re still focused on the mission, which is protect the nation’s transportation system to ensure freedom of movement for people in commerce. “But once that paycheck doesn’t come, I think that that train whistle is going to get louder in everyone’s heads, and it could get so loud that people cannot focus on their job because they’re focusing on things like ‘The bank is calling me for the fifth time today’, or ‘I don’t know how to pay for my daycare,’ things like that.” Threats made about federal workers not being entitled to back pay by Trump and his top officials have heightened anxieties and fears and “thrown a lot more people for a loop, especially the people that are disadvantaged, single parents or living paycheck to paycheck”, added Cochems. “It just feels like they’re intentionally using us as political pawns, and they intentionally want to make our jobs and lives unstable,” he said. “Even worse than morale is the future implication for how our government runs,” added Novak. “I think having a strong civil service that is not politically motivated is the most effective to render modern services for our citizens. Furloughed workers want to go back to work. We need Congress to pass a budget.” The White House and office of management and budget did not respond to multiple requests for comment.",https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/12/federal-workers-firings-threats,Business,BBC,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/842f57837fcc633d1af29adfa994f25614879363/869_0_4585_3667/master/4585.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=5ef0f542e1763b90d699e19685886099",2025-10-12T10:00:49+00:00,1d2cbae8273baf8ff43c1dc9c86019bcbf69ecbd
d874906e57d3,‘London has turned into something crazy’: is the city in the grip of a crime wave?,,"London is no longer a safe place to live, at least in the eyes of some of its richest residents – and the 47th president of the United States. “I think he’s done a terrible job,” Donald Trump said during his state visit to the UK last month, in his latest broadside at London’s mayor, Sadiq Khan. “Crime in London is through the roof.” Trump’s view is increasingly accepted wisdom in rightwing circles and is gaining traction more widely . Crime is even being blamed – along with rising taxes – for an apparent exodus of the super-rich from the UK. A prime property agent recalls a client’s Rolex being stolen off his wrist the first night he moved into Kensington, the west London neighbourhood that is one of the city’s most affluent. Advisers to the super-rich describe a city where “spotters” linger outside exclusive restaurants sizing up possible targets, while demand for private bodyguards grows. It is a view that Reform UK’s leader, Nigel Farage, often repeats, warning one journalist : “I dare you to walk through the West End of London after 9 o’clock of an evening wearing jewellery. You wouldn’t do it. You know that I’m right. You wouldn’t do it.” A series of high-profile crimes has helped reinforce that view. The ex-Formula One driver Jenson Button and his wife, Brittny, had a suitcase containing £250,000 worth of valuables snatched within moments of their arrival at King’s Cross St Pancras. In January, the socialite Shafira Huang’s mansion in Primrose Hill, north London, was burgled, with thieves taking more than £10m worth of bespoke jewellery. In November, the owners of the Sellier luxury goods store in Knightsbridge shared footage of masked men ransacking their premises, later commenting: “London has just turned into something crazy.” But is crime in the capital really “through the roof”? While statistics show crime is falling across England and Wales, with violent crime dropping dramatically over the past two decades , crime in London is up. Recorded crime has increased by 31% in the past decade in the area that the Metropolitan police covers, with violent crime up by 40%. Mobile phone theft remains a menace in London, with one ebike-riding thief jailed last year for stealing 24 phones in an hour. But there are signs that the tide is starting to turn in the capital, with violent crime falling by 6% in the year to the end of March, according to the Met police. Luxury watch theft, once a stain on London’s elite neighbourhoods of Mayfair and Knightsbridge, has massively reduced in the past two years. So why does perception not match reality? Is violent crime falling? Many crimes go unreported to the police, so the Crime Survey for England and Wales asks tens of thousands of households directly every year whether they have been the victim of a crime. The findings suggest crime has fallen dramatically over the past 20 years. Crime survey chart Last year London reported the lowest number of homicides of under-25s for more than two decades. Overall, murders are at a five-year low, and the rate is much lower than in other international cities such as New York, Paris, Brussels, Berlin and Madrid, according to analysis by Khan’s office. But knife crime has been rising in London: while the number of recorded knife crimes fell from 2012 in the run-up to 2016, it then started to rise again, hitting a peak of 15,600 incidents in 2019. There was a sharp drop during the pandemic, but it has since been closing in on its previous peak, standing at 15,000 in 2023-24. More recent statistics show knife crime in London dropping by 19% in the three months to June, compared with a year earlier. Other serious offences are dropping: in the year ending in March, there was a 6% reduction in violent crime overall, according to the Met police. And in a city that is home to about 9 million people, Londoners are less likely (26.4 offences per 1,000 people) to be a victim of violent crime than people across the rest of England and Wales (31.9 offences per 1,000 people), according to figures from the mayor’s office. So why is it that the narrative of a lawless capital is so prevalent? A YouGov survey in September showed 51% of adults thought violent crime in London was increasing, against just 7% who thought it was falling. The “broken windows” idea partly explains why: this is the criminology theory that visible signs of minor crime and antisocial behaviour create an environment that encourages further crime, and normalises disorder as a part of public life. A CCTV camera captures the moment when thieves on a moped snatch a phone in London. Photograph: Metropolitan police/PA Take phone theft, for example. After dropping during the pandemic, phone theft has been steadily rising since 2020, when there were 55,820 incidents reported to the Met. The figure has more than doubled, standing at 117,211 last year. These snatch thefts can cause huge distress and financial impact to victims, given the vast amount of personal data stored on phones and mobile banking apps. They are also harder to police, with criminals using ebikes and mopeds to make rapid getaways, and links to organised gangs that have sophisticated and established supply chains to sell phones abroad . It means that in areas such as Knightsbridge, which was hit particularly hard by watch thefts in 2022, it gave residents a broader sense of lawlessness in the UK. But some of these numbers suggest police are starting to get a grip. Reports of phone theft fell by 28% to 213 in the City of London, which has its own police force, in the first four months of 2025, compared with the same period in the year prior. Outside the capital’s financial district, phone theft is still rising, but luxury watch, handbag and jewellery theft are all down in London, according to figures obtained from the Met police under a freedom of information request. There were 783 counts of stolen watches that were worth at least £3,000 in 2024, compared with 2,054 the year prior, according to the Met’s data. Counts of stolen handbags worth at least £1,000 fell from 2,324 in 2023 to 721 last year. Counts of stolen jewellery, excluding watches, worth at least £1,000 fell from 4,977 to 1,863. The sharp drop coincides with a big crackdown by the Met, with plainclothes officers baiting thieves in crime hotspots after dark. This summer three men were jailed after a Met police investigation into a series of high-value watch robberies in central London. Detectives used CCTV to identify a group of violent repeat offenders, who carried out two robberies in Mayfair on consecutive days. Theft of watches graphic Despite the big drop, the perception of danger still remains among many of the super-rich, especially when it comes to their watches. A store manager in Mayfair said that while he made his living by selling luxury watches, he now told his clients not to wear them on the street. Luxury goods thefts graphic Reputations: hard-won, easily lost The capital’s Berkeley Square, which is bordered by A-list hotspots such as Sexy Fish restaurant and Annabel’s members club, has become a hotspot for late-night watch crime, according to the Watch Register, which works and shares data with the police. The timepieces, which are easier to transport than drugs or cash, have now become an “underworld currency”, the company said. About 20% of watches that it finds are in a different country from where they were stolen. “Luxury watches have become a preferred form of criminal currency due to their high portability across borders, which makes them easier to move than drugs or cash,” said Julian Radcliffe, founder of the Watch Register. “They are small, portable, innocuous items which are only identifiable by serial number.” Not wearing a luxury watch outside is now the standard advice, says Matthew Beer, a director at the security firm King Safety and Security. “There has been a longstanding issue around opportunistic street crime,” he said. “That slowed a little bit with the Met’s response with more tactical interventions but we are still seeing a lot of electric bike-enabled phone theft and watch theft with an unpredictable level of violence associated with that.” It means that for ultra-high net worth clients, there is a greater appetite for “close protection” services – in other words, bodyguards. “Those who would have had protection in the past have a greater appetite for more security,” Beer said. “So where we once had a security driver and one close protection officer, we are now pushing that out so family members also receive protection.” Crimes graphic The numbers suggest demand for security is growing: in 2024, there were 4,650 applications for a close protection licence from the Security Industry Authority, a 33% rise compared with the year before. Last year the regulator awarded 187,113 qualifications across the industry, an increase of 5%, which includes services such as the transport of cash and valuables, door supervision and security guarding. “More established travellers, perhaps someone who comes from an environment that is historically more dangerous, they would still view London as a relatively safe place to be,” Beer added. “Younger clients who are more engaged on social media; their understanding of it is perhaps a little clearer. You don’t need to be ultra-high net worth individual to be a target: [you are] if you have a reasonably nice watch or carrying a designer handbag.” Stephen Helliwell, of the security consultants Aldermans, said: “I think the police are under strain as [political] protests continue; that is a lot of distraction. But it is during times of economic stress that is when people are motivated to turn to crime.” Even so, it has not been enough to drive off the super-rich, he said. “Some of the high net worth clients we have got like football stars, they will just strengthen the preventions that they have got. They still want to reside in London because it is a great city.” A spokesperson for the Met police said: “Tackling violent crime in all of its forms is one of the Met’s priorities and we have reduced the number of personal robberies across London by 12% since April. “Uniform and plainclothed officers proactively patrol robbery hotspots to identify offences taking place, but more importantly to help prevent and deter offenders from committing them in the first place.”",https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/oct/11/is-london-in-the-grip-of-a-wave-its-not-so-simple,Business,BBC,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/46bd98640d5057dd9cad689a49c95e2d059f2f78/337_0_3365_2692/master/3365.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=54893cf2a2f94650ef978bc90b5aa14d",2025-10-11T10:00:20+00:00,7d4b71ba3e5d21f2f1ccfe8a15f2ff60fb94e544

A McKinsey study found that 80% of companies using generative AI have seen “no significant bottom-line impact”, with 42% of them literally abandoning their AI projects. An MIT study found that 95% of the AI pilot projects at the big companies they surveyed “failed”. And now there’s workslop! A new study published in the Harvard Business Review says that more than 40% of US-based full-time employees reported receiving AI-generated content that “masquerades as good work but lacks the substance to meaningfully advance a given task”. This “workslop” is “destroying productivity”, according to the study’s researchers. Who is really to blame for workslop? Sure, blame big tech companies for yet again releasing untested and unproven products before they’re ready for prime time. Or the media and tech community who, for the past three years, have been writing pieces like Yahoo Japan wants all its 11,000 employees to use Gen AI to double their productivity by 2028 or AI will replace doctors, teachers, and make humans “unnecessary for most things” . All of this creates a lot of unnecessary hype and unfounded expectations. But in the workplace, the buck always stops with the boss. The responsibility for AI’s “workslop” lies fully at the feet of the employer. For more than 20 years, my company has implemented customer relationship and financial management applications at hundreds of small and mid-sized businesses across the country. We’ve worked with thousands of employees. We’ve had good projects and straight-out failures. As a technology consultant, we’ve made our share of mistakes. But the most common root cause of technology disappointments, failures and letdowns can always be found with the people who are buying and implementing the product. So before throwing shade at software companies rolling out AI, I think it’s fair to ask employers a few questions. For example, did you invest in training for your employees? Do your employees truly understand how to create the right prompts in order to get the best answers? Has your company standardized on an AI assistant or is it just a free-for-all mess of apps? Do you have an AI policy that formalizes what AI can and cannot be used for and who can and cannot use it? Do you have a designated person in your company who is responsible for your AI-based applications? Has this person been trained and provided technical support to do this job? Are you working with a competent partner, consultant or developer to provide these kinds of services? Most importantly, do you actually have a plan for using this technology effectively or are you just leaving it up to your employees to figure it all out? Do you have specific metrics for measuring AI’s effectiveness, or are you just relying on vague assumptions of “productivity”? Unfortunately, many employers are duped by big tech into thinking that they just press a button and their software starts doing magical things that spew out money for their business. But, in order not to scare people away, these same tech companies don’t warn their customers of all the other things that need to happen – and money that needs to be spent – in order to maximize the use of their product. In most cases, the software is not the problem. It’s the lack of investment in the people using it. AI can be a powerful tool if deployed the right way and with the right expectations. But in the end it’s just that: a tool. And new tools require thought, training, processes and investment. In the end, AI doesn’t produce “workslop”. Employers do.",https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/oct/12/ai-workslop-us-employees,Business,BBC,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e9d7b3b9f0829488a55b6fc6e31d912285d0fe88/533_0_6185_4946/master/6185.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=ecad1667d80eccce4eac5759c99c6331",2025-10-12T14:00:55+00:00,3dc7bf0500ebf29c9b0d757cf2479ca388fd0917
8ccfb3b1fbdc,I spent years trying to avoid Vinted. It turns out I was right to be afraid,,"I downloaded Vinted for the first time this year. I’m incredibly late to the party, since the app has more than 16 million UK users and launched here in 2014. My not-so-conscientious objection was rooted in a hatred of secondhand clothes. My inner (teenaged) self said I’d worked my way to being able to afford nice (ie new) things, and I didn’t want my wardrobe to look like I’d raided a jumble sale. Shopping secondhand would make me feel poor again. Two things changed. Every other time I asked a well-dressed friend where her jumper, bag or trainers were from, she would say Vinted. Then, as I emptied my wardrobe from the storage unit it had been living in for a year, I was greeted by my secret shame: two unworn shirts from a cult (ie expensive) brand that I bought years ago and missed the window to return. I got the app, snapped a few pics of the shirts and wrote what I considered to be an enticing sales pitch. I sold my first shirt on the same day and received a five-star review from my buyer. I was an ethical entrepreneur! I was saving the planet! I was spreading joy and getting paid! Riding a dopamine high of “free” money, I listed more clothes and waited for the cash to roll in. To my utter dismay, my extremely fashionable, hardly worn clothes were no longer flying off the shelf. A friend explained I had probably priced the shirts too cheaply and my other clothes too high. The app’s pricing algorithm agreed. Still, it felt like a personal rejection, like the internet was saying I had bad taste. It’s not just selling that gives you a dopamine hit. The app can generate endless pings and updates to keep you engaged. I have notifications turned off on my phone, but I got 21 emails from Vinted the first week I started using it. You get told when someone “likes” an item you’ve listed (a way of saving something they might buy later). Meanwhile, as a buyer, if you like an item, the seller often slides into your inbox offering it at a discounted price. I found this very stressful at first, like the digital equivalent of making eye contact with a slightly desperate salesperson. Fast fashion rightly gets a bad rap but Vinted’s platform was built using the same digital tricks that keep us scrolling on Instagram or TikTok. There’s an algorithm that predicts what you want, gamification and variable rewards that keep you hooked. Six months in, it’s easily one of the most used apps on my phone. My smug sense that I was participating in the circular economy was undermined when I told a climate-conscious friend how cheap secondhand books are on Vinted (I don’t understand how anyone is making money selling them). She pointed out there’s a pretty big environmental cost to shipping books around the country, and that perhaps my local library was a more sustainable option. And that’s before you factor in the pay and conditions for delivery drivers at most of the big delivery companies. Not only have I lost hours scrolling, Vinted has also made me petty. As I switched from selling to buying, I learned how small-scale haggling is built into the platform. Vinted automatically calculates a 5% or 10% discount on something you like so you can offer less than it’s listed for. I spent an entire month “negotiating” the price down on a summer dress. In the end we were haggling over less than a pound and when it arrived I got three wears out of it before it became too cold. I punched the air when I got £2 off a slightly worn winter coat. It turned up with a tear in the lining that wasn’t in the listing. I felt simultaneously outraged and delighted – surely I could squeeze some more money off from the seller? She called my bluff and suggested I post it back so she could sell it to someone else. Pay for postage twice? Over my dead body. Vinted has saved me money and brought me joy. But I’ve definitely spent more than I earned from those shirts. It’s probably time to take a break, but if you’re interested in a hot pink wool coat from Cos (good condition) I’m still open to offers.

280bbff4ebfb,The Guardian view on an AI bubble: capitalism still hasn’t evolved to protect itself,,"T he message from global regulators this week was blunt: the AI boom is driving stocks to dotcom-bubble highs – and the world is finally listening. With so much cash riding on so few firms, any loss of faith could send shares tumbling and drag down the wider economy. China’s proposed export controls on rare earths add a fresh threat: not just to sentiment, but to advanced chip supply chains themselves. It’s a long way down from such dizzying heights if gravity reasserts itself. Warnings from the past abound in Charles Kindleberger’s history of financial crises, Manias, Panics and Crashes , which begins with tulip mania in 1636. What commonly happens, he wrote, is “that some event changes the economic outlook. New opportunities for profits are seized, and overdone.” Once the mistake is realised, there’s a panicked exit with a crash in the price of “whatever has been the subject of the mania”. The pattern repeats itself so frequently that it seems investors never learn and central bankers learn too late. But why? Look to economist Hyman Minsky, from whom Kindleberger borrowed much. Minsky addressed the deeper conundrum that is being sidestepped today: how to stabilise financial innovations before they destabilise the system? He thought that the longer markets remain calm, the more risk they take. The genius – and danger – of capitalism is that it can’t stop chasing another win. To prevent that, Minsky thought, required not moral restraint but institutional redesign. Minsky’s insight into capitalism was that it runs on belief. Firms invest today because they expect others to invest tomorrow, while lenders need high asset prices – and move to shore them up. This confidence loop keeps the economy humming until doubt creeps in, valuations slip and an inevitable and abrupt market crash looms. To avert this needed radical change. His plan advocated a “big government” not to prop up share prices, but to prop up society when share prices fall. Backing this was a “big bank”, a monetary authority that would make it harder to buy risky assets on credit. Minsky thought cash should be guided toward productive uses, not asset inflation. He didn’t want to stifle innovation but to make it safe for democracy. It’s a warning worth hearing today. This summer, OpenAI’s Sam Altman called some tech valuations “ insane ”. Amazon’s Jeff Bezos says we’re in a bubble . The AI boom looks alarmingly like Minsky’s Ponzi endgame – with prices sustained purely by expectations of rising valuations and easy refinancing. Startups with no product raise billions;  index funds become dominated by juiced up stocks; capital chases fads rather than earnings. The ratio of the total market cap of all US stocks to US GDP is at a record high. Sceptics , however, point out in the year before the dotcom crash the Nasdaq rose 86%, while it has only gone up 24% in the last 12 months. AI may change the world. But perhaps not, if markets can’t deal with the wave of speculation it has unleashed. A Minskyan approach would couple borrowing limits with fiscal and industrial policies that steer cash toward socially useful tech. Mr Altman warned that AI startups with “three people and an idea” are raising vast sums, adding “that’s not rational behaviour. Someone’s gonna get burned.” He’s right. The point isn’t to scold risk-takers, but to build capitalism that can handle – and survive – their excesses.",https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/oct/10/the-guardian-view-on-an-ai-bubble-capitalism-still-hasnt-evolved-to-protect-itself,Business,BBC,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d5e10d9b752b28147ba028247b227c60a533c118/11_0_3219_2576/master/3219.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=3844df74412156090f93fbafbc4d51e7",2025-10-10T17:00:11+00:00,46dccac20c9f32fcad34825b9643a2f2f004bce7
364a95a20933,"It’s Sam Altman: the man who stole the rights from copyright. If he’s the future, can we go backwards?",,"T ake a look at Sam Altman. I mean, actually do it. Go to Google images, where you can find countless photos of the OpenAI boss smiling in a kind of wan genius way, the humble lost puppy of Silicon Valley . But I urge you to simply cover the bottom half of his face in any of these pictures, and you will immediately clock that Sam has the sad-psycho eyes of the lost woman’s boyfriend who the police have asked to front the missing person’s appeal. Please come home, Sheila – we’re all worried sick and we just want you back. If that joke seems off-colour, or crass, or some kind of manipulative stretch – please, don’t worry. I’m using the OpenAI gold standard of giving-a-toss, where the unwilling subjects of any generated content have to formally, time-consumingly and bureaucratically opt out of being used/abused/exploited any way anyone likes. I haven’t heard from Sam, so my assumption is that he’s fine with me saying that he knows exactly where Sheila is because he put her there. He is, after all, fast emerging as precisely the type to appear alongside the phrase “in plain sight”. The past fortnight for Sam has involved the release of AI video generator Sora 2 – a staggering upgrade on the Sora of barely 10 months ago – and its instant descent into a sludge of stolen copyrighted goods. We also saw the announcement of a further web of circular bargains between OpenAI and chip firms like Nvidia and AMD that brings OpenAI’s frenzied deal tally to over $1tn this year alone. That absolutely does not mean that in addition to enabling you to watch videos of meticulously created characters get pixel-puppeted by aggressively bigoted and talentless losers, OpenAI will also enable you to lose your home in a financial crash if the bubble bursts badly. And look, no offence to Sora’s “creators”. I often walk through art galleries and realise the stuff on the walls would be so much better if I simply stole it and drew hilarious penises on it or whatever, and that they wouldn’t have made it publicly viewable if they didn’t want that. Furthermore, no tech titans have a cultural life, so they can’t possibly imagine what could be so creatively valuable you wouldn’t want a robot to desecrate it for cash. If you’ve seen Sam’s frequent reading recommendations, you’ll know they’re literally the “business philosophy” section of a second-tier airport bookshop. Mainly this week, he wanted us to know Sora 2 was all cool and fun. “It is way less strange to watch a feed full of memes of yourself than I thought it would be,” Sam posted reassuringly . So everything’s fine! Although, I guess it helps if you’re one of the most powerful people in the world and making untold billions off this stuff, not just getting revenge-porned in a Byzantium simulation because somehow historical prompts seem to confuse the “guardrails”. I’ve seen it said that OpenAI’s motto should be “better to beg forgiveness than ask permission”, but that cosies it preposterously. Its actual motto seems to be “we’ll do what we want and you’ll let us, bitch”. Consider Altman’s recent political journey. “To anyone familiar with the history of Germany in the 1930s,” Sam warned in 2016 , “it’s chilling to watch Trump in action.” He seems to have got over this in time to attend Donald Trump’s second inauguration , presumably because – if we have to extend his artless and predictable analogy – he’s now one of the industrialists welcome in the chancellery to carve up the spoils. “Thank you for being such a pro-business, pro-innovation president,” Sam simpered to Trump at a recent White House dinner for tech titans. “It’s a very refreshing change.” Inevitably, the Trump administration has refused to bring forward any AI regulation at all. Meanwhile, please remember something Sam and his ironicidal maniacs said earlier this year, when it was suggested that the Chinese AI chatbot DeepSeek might have been trained on some of OpenAI’s work . “We are aware of and reviewing indications that DeepSeek may have inappropriately distilled our models, and will share information as we know more,” his firm’s anguished statement ran. “We take aggressive, proactive countermeasures to protect our technology.” Hilariously, it seemed that the last entity on earth with the power to fight AI theft was OpenAI. It was left to Hollywood talent agencies this week to extract some kind of momentary pause from Altman, who posted some flannel about trying to direct, if not hard cash, then certainly some “new kind of engagement” at those he openly called “rightsholders”. Many of us remember a time – about 15 minutes ago – when rightsholders meant the people who hold the rights . I mean, the clue’s right there in the word. But Sam is post-rights. The question is: if he’s post creative rights, can we honestly believe he isn’t effectively post other kinds of rights? OpenAI wants what all loving platforms ultimately want: its users never to have to leave its confines. It’s clearly positioning towards being seen as the new default homepage of the web, as Meta once did.

3521bfeea732,The Guardian view on AC Milan playing a ‘home’ game in Perth: the clue should be in the name,,"F ootball clubs are community assets, possessing a value, history and meaning which cannot be captured on a balance sheet. They belong to the cities and towns that have sustained them over the decades. For the vast majority of supporters, the sense of identity and matchgoing rituals associated with following their team are worth as much as the occasional trophy or glorious victory. That culture becomes harder to maintain, however, if your club’s next game is taking place 5,000 miles away. European football’s governing body, Uefa, this week announced that it will allow a Spanish league fixture between Villarreal and Barcelona to take place closer to Cuba than Catalonia, in Miami’s Hard Rock stadium. This will be followed, in February, by the relocation to Australia of an Italian Serie A match between Milan and Como. Global sports promoters, rubbing their hands at the potential profits this precedent could unlock, are cockahoop. Supporters organisations in Spain and Italy are considerably less impressed . It is not hard to see why. The clue as to where Milan should play home fixtures is in the name. And at a purely sporting level, regularly playing games on the other side of the world would undermine the fairness of leagues based on an equal distribution of home advantage. While fans outside Europe may get to see their heroes play in meaningful contests this way, the money spent staging them would be far better invested in boosting domestic competitions such as the US’s Major League Soccer. Sadly, in an age when the hyper-monetisation of elite football is already far advanced, a Serie A game in Perth looks like the thin end of a very large wedge of cash. Uefa’s reluctant permission follows the out-of-court settlement of a lawsuit brought by a US sports promoter, which argued that restrictions on where teams play their matches were illegal. For European clubs desperate to compete with the financial heft of English Premier League rivals, the riches promised by freer access to global markets add up to a tempting invitation to sell their soul. As football’s profit-hungry overlords seek ever more creative ways to turn a quick buck, the traditional supporter is the last person on their minds. Spain and Italy have already sold their annual Super Cup games to sportswashing Saudi Arabia, while the cost of tickets for the 2026 World Cup is likely to soar thanks to the use of dynamic ticket pricing . In Britain, the number of one-off visitors paying hospitality-type prices is booming at elite matches, as younger and less well-off fans are priced out. A line must be drawn. Treasured local institutions should not be shunted around the globe in search of the highest bidder. Though it once toyed with the notion of an extra round of matches to be played outside England, the Premier League has thankfully distanced itself from the idea for now. Uefa executives, having been blindsided by the latest developments, have vowed to ensure that rules are updated in order to “uphold the integrity of domestic competitions, and the close bond between clubs, their supporters and local communities”. Longsuffering supporters must hold them to their word. The challenge of “playing away” is an integral part of football. But it should never be necessary to book an intercontinental flight to attend a domestic league fixture.",https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/oct/10/the-guardian-view-on-ac-milan-playing-a-home-game-in-perth-the-clue-should-be-in-the-name,Business,BBC,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/15b5eeb8669133cea3bdb73fad2b672938a704fb/434_0_3445_2756/master/3445.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=65b45a2935047a58f1da61e8e31f5d3b",2025-10-10T16:59:18+00:00,d5498413d3588e115ac0ccd765c83842ea60afcd
7a60f3be2226,Do we need Imax? 70mm? VistaVision? All I need to watch movies at the cinema is darkness and quiet,,"O n what sort of screen should you watch One Battle After Another ? Paul Thomas Anderson’s new film about revolutionary radicals in a ravaged United States comes in a plethora of slightly different, vaguely confusing formats. It was originally shot in ultra-rare, 70-year-old VistaVision celluloid, but there are only four cinemas in the entire world that can actually accommodate this – one in London, three in the US . There is also an Imax version on 70mm celluloid film, the more common digital Imax format, and a 70mm film projection for some select cinemas. And, finally, there are the majority of current cinemas with more standard digital projection, which also happen to have quite big screens for you to gaze up at moving pictures in the dark. With attendances falling and cinemas under threat, I understand why there has been a push to make seeing films more of an event in recent years. Since the pandemic, Tom Cruise has put himself front and centre of a campaign to encourage people into the cinema. Christopher Nolan has also made several of his films with the grand Imax screens in mind: his upcoming The Odyssey is said to be the first blockbuster made entirely with Imax cameras (screenings for the film in the highest-grade format sold out a year in advance ). “Between the vision-filling screen and sound that chases you around the auditorium, it’s more like stepping into the movie than watching it at a safe distance,” purred the Odeon website for its Imax screenings of Mission: Impossible – The Final Reckoning. There is a clear desire to put the emphasis on an all-encompassing feast for the senses; inevitably, the cost of these special screenings is usually higher than a traditional cinema ticket. I love going to the cinema and I try to see new films this way as much as is feasible. But I do think that the focus on seeing things in the cinema now is becoming over-egged – especially when it is given some sort of moral imperative, or if an idea forms that a certain premium version is the “true” experience. Cinema used to be a relatively accessible and affordable mass pursuit. Any move away from this, while potentially bringing short-term gain, may be a mistake in the long run. The fear lingers that by foregrounding limited and premium offerings – akin to going to the opera or a West End theatre – lesser cinemas could be further diminished, and audiences discouraged if a certain format isn’t available or is simply too expensive. Anecdotal evidence from true believers (in the right locations) suggests that seeing One Battle After Another in VistaVision provides the greatest pleasure: the colours are more beautiful, the look and feel is purer, like seeing a painting in person rather than a reproduction in a book. Other cineastes (or Letterboxd bros , per modern nomenclature) say that it must be seen in Imax formats for the true thrill-ride. I personally find viewing at an Imax a little like you’re watching tennis – moving your head this way and that to follow where you should be looking, and the emphasis on immersive viewing a little too literal. A friend suggests that unless you have the perfect seat near the centre of an Imax room, the experience is actually inferior. What is it that we love about seeing a film in the cinema? I don’t think it can be defined by the dimensions of the screen alone. It’s being in a dark room, free from distractions, with a reasonably comfortable seat, surrounded by others, watching the film on a big – or big enough – screen above: sometimes it’s in a vast theatre, sometimes it’s a room for 20 people. All have their merits. And as the host of one US film podcast suggested when asked what was the best place to see One Battle After Another: “In the movie theatre you like the most.” In the end, I saw the film on an “XL” screen at my nearest multiplex: I can’t quite figure out if that meant a bigger screen, bigger seats, or bigger buckets of popcorn. I’ll admit the thrilling visual aspects must hit well on an even more souped-up screen, but they were pretty great from my vantage point, too. As were its kinetic energy and frantic score, dragging you through a story both compellingly strange and laugh-out-loud funny. Granted, there are also valid criticisms to be made. One of my formative moments engaging with “serious” film was when I was aged about 14 and saw Rear Window. It made me instantly realise there could be more to a film than most of what I had seen up to that point. The fact that I happened to watch it on an early-1990s, medium-sized cathode-ray TV one bored Saturday afternoon, almost by accident, didn’t diminish the effect. A love for film can blossom in many formats. Under the right conditions, everything is cinema. skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Matters of Opinion Guardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and more Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

7b5ecad59fb0,First Brands: why a maker of spark plugs and wiper blades has Wall Street worried,,"Financial problems at the maker of spark plugs, wiper blades, brake calipers, brake shoes, tow hitches and motor oil has caused intense anxiety on Wall Street in recent weeks. Car parts are not usually something that causes finance chiefs to lose much sleep. But the potentially multibillion-dollar financial crisis surrounding First Brands has them rattled. As ever in finance, it’s what investors don’t know that scares the most, and with First Brands, there appears to be plenty. What is First Brands? First Brands was founded by the Malaysian-born businessman Patrick James. Starting life as Ohio-based Crowne Group, James acquired Trico, best known for windshield wipers, and went on a debt-fueled acquisitions spree, snapping up auto-focused parts makers. James rechristening the company as First Brands Group in 2020. It now owns 24 automotive-related companies, according to the group’s website . “If your car is 10 years old, odds are good that parts from these companies are already on there,” notes the auto website CarBuzz. “And they were probably half the cost of original equipment parts sold through dealerships.” Seems like a sensible business. Why did it collapse? The company filed for bankruptcy protection in the southern district of Texas on 29 September due to creditor concern over the company’s use of opaque off-balance sheet financing, listing liabilities – what it owed – between $10bn and $50bn against assets – what it owned – of between $1bn and $10bn. But the speed of the First Brands implosion has spooked investors, and the more that’s known, the more they are spooked. The company had until recently had a decent cash buffer, but it was using private debt or “shadow banking” to borrow against invoices, in effect keeping debt off its balance-sheet disclosures, and turning a company with 26,000 employees into a finance company more than the supplier of auto parts. That system, known as factoring, is not unusual. But when the size of that debt, and who is holding it, becomes obscure, problems can rapidly accumulate, as the financial industry saw with the collapse of the UK fintech Greensill Capital in 2021 and London-listed firm Carillion in 2018. On Thursday, the technology group Raistone, which arranged some off-balance sheet financing, claimed that as much as $2.3bn had “simply vanished” as part of the bankrupt auto supplier’s failure. Jim Chanos, who predicted the Enron disaster in 2001, told the Financial Times that complex financial systems tend to flourish at the tail end of a boom when everyone wants in. “As long as everything works, nobody asks questions,” he said. “It isn’t until something stumbles, or the markets stumble, that people say, ‘Wait a minute, what are we doing here? This doesn’t make any sense.’” Why is Wall Street so worried? Just as in other financial crises – most recently the housing crisis that led to the 2008 financial meltdown – Wall Street is worried that the issues at First Brands are a sign of worse to come. The Texas auto lender Tricolor – which specialized in lending to low-income “sub-prime” lenders – collapsed last month amid fraud allegations . Ben Lourie, professor of accounting at the University of California, Irvine, says the issues at First Brands, and the collapse of Tricolor , connect because one was selling cut-price parts, and the other older cars, to consumers under economic pressure. “My guess is the companies went into bankruptcy because the market is not great and they started doing things they should not be doing. So they went into financial innovation with invoice financing,” Lourie says. “The fear is that the private debt market has been too hot, and [has been] giving out money, at high interest rates, to companies that just can’t pay it back, and especially to companies in the auto market,” he adds. Fears over what the failure of both companies portends are highlighting worries about what other issues the private debt markets may face. “The private debt market is much bigger than it used to be, and we can see that by companies pulling their IPOs because they are raising money in those markets,” says Lourie. “But there isn’t as much disclosure as there is in the public markets. So there is a disclosure issue because we don’t really know what’s going on.” He adds: “When there isn’t as much disclosure, there’s more risk, and there’s a fear of contagion, because somebody is going to have to take on these losses, and eventually it will reach up into the banks.” Jefferies, a midsized Wall Street lender, was advising First Brands, acting as lender against invoices through a specialist invoice-finance fund it manages, Point Bonita Capital, and placing billions of dollars of loans with other investors. Who those investors are, and how far the chain of debt stretches into the mainstream banking system, is an open question. Jefferies says it has $715m in exposure to First Brands. An investigation has been set up in part to examine whether invoices were pledged more than once. But it goes further, with concerns mounting that First Brands’ precarious arrangements could be found elsewhere. Brett House, an economics professor at Columbia Business School, says concerns are primarily about unregulated private debt markets and the assets they hold that are often not marked-to-market, an accounting system that values a company’s assets and liabilities at their current fair market value. “When these assets become impaired, it’s a surprise to markets, because there hadn’t been a gradual updating of information,” House says, “and because we don’t have great transparency on the location and concentration of where these assets are being held. And that can often have knock-on effects that are unanticipated.” So Wall Street got too clever for its own good, again. Why should I care? The worry is that the collapse of an obscure car parts company is the first domino, and that if more dominoes collapse, it could spread across the financial system, eventually triggering a wider crisis. Severe problems in the financial markets caused not by macro-economic conditions, but by the intricacies of capital management have happened before – the collapse of a high leveraged hedge fund, Long-Term Capital Management in 1998, that required a $3.6bn bailout, or the subprime mortgage loan crisis of 2007 that caused the collapse of Lehman Brothers and the onset of severe financial recession. Such analogies may not be exact, since the problems now being unearthed relate to private debt markets that expanded significantly after banks tightened lending standards after the 2008 crash. “The risk may sit in the balance sheets of funds and other asset managers that may create counterparty risk for large financial institutions that can cause reverberations from relatively obscure small funds hitting problems and create a cascading effect through the financial system that gets amplified by the structure of different asset classes and is unanticipated because of a lack of transparency,” says House. “It effectively means that unregulated parts of the debt and asset management market may hold risks that have implications for the entire financial system.”",https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/oct/10/first-brands-wall-street,Business,BBC,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ce738a5e7f3010d1712c456d87a8c480676bad70/333_0_3334_2667/master/3334.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=d39c5f1dbde41aed1eab7281920230eb",2025-10-10T10:00:51+00:00,1c33a4c3520f1d5a00435d1efa0795fbe18d8967
8a68cb2f3b93,Tony Blair and Nick Clegg hosted dinner giving tech bosses access to UK minister,,"Tony Blair and Nick Clegg hosted a private dinner earlier this year at which a select group of technology entrepreneurs were given access to a key minister, official documents have revealed. The former prime minister, who is a champion of the tech industry, held the dinner in an upmarket London hotel in his capacity as the head of the Tony Blair Institute (TBI) political consultancy. He and Clegg, the former deputy prime minister who at the time was a senior executive at Meta , invited leaders of six tech companies to dine with Poppy Gustafsson, who was the government’s investment minister responsible for persuading firms to invest in Britain. Blair is an evangelical proponent of the revolutionary potential of technology to transform faltering public services and has long courted alliances with leaders in the industry. His consultancy has echoed much of this zeal through a stream of policy papers arguing that artificial intelligence should be put at the heart of government. However, critics are concerned that Blair, who is known to be close to Keir Starmer’s government , has been able to set the agenda without enough public scrutiny. There have also been questions over the reliance of Blair’s consultancy on donations from the Silicon Valley billionaire Larry Ellison, a friend of Donald Trump and Elon Musk. Ellison, who this year briefly became the world’s richest person , has donated or promised more than $300m to Blair’s consultancy. The documents released to the Guardian under freedom of information legislation show how the 12 diners discussed the government’s evolving policies on artificial intelligence at what was described a “salon dinner”. Do you have information about this story? Email henry.dyer@theguardian.com, or (using a non-work phone) use Signal or WhatsApp to message +44 7721 857348. For the most secure communications see theguardian.com/tips Hosted at the end of January in the five-star Corinthia hotel, the diners included Lonne Jaffe, the managing director of the US venture capital firm Insight Partners, which invests in technology companies. Also present were Alex Kendall, the chief executive of Wayve, which is seeking to develop self-driving cars; Nigel Toon, the head of Graphcore, which produces computer chips; and Marc Warner, the chief executive of Faculty AI, which published a joint document last year with TBI on how AI could be used to improve public services . A spokesperson for Clegg, who as president for global affairs at Meta jointly hosted the dinner, said :“During his time at Meta Nick Clegg regularly met with government ministers and leaders from other tech companies. As the executive responsible for policy and global affairs that was literally his job.” A TBI spokesperson said: “This event was a discussion about a range of issues between tech leaders with a minister in attendance. No company paid to attend.” The companies represented at the dinner said they had not donated money to TBI, nor hired it. The dinner illustrates how Blair’s consultancy works to push his pro-technology agenda. Having rapidly expanded, TBI is active in 45 countries with its staff numbering more than 900 . Its latest accounts show its income totalled $145m in 2022 from a mixture of fees for its advice and donations. The identities of many of its donors and clients are kept secret. The consultancy has drawn criticism that its policy positions have been shaped by its donors’ commercial interests – an accusation it has denied . It was also criticised for continuing to take money from Saudi Arabia after the murder of the journalist Jamal Khashoggi in 2018. Blair is in line to play a leading role in the reconstruction of postwar Gaza. Weeks before the dinner, the government had given TBI a confidential summary of its action plan for artificial intelligence days before it was due to be published. On 9 January, Feryal Clark, then a minister in the Department for Science, Innovation and Technology (DSIT), spoke to Jakob Mokander, TBI’s science policy director, at her instigation. The next day, an aide to Clark emailed Mokander to say: “It was great talking to you yesterday. As a follow-up please see this confidential summary of the action plan. Thank you for agreeing to amplify publication of the plan on Monday through your network and supportive quotes.” Mokander replied: “Thank you for sharing the action plan (confidentiality noted).” Blair backed the action plan , aimed at expanding the country’s role in developing and deploying artificial intelligence, when it was published on 13 January . Asked why it had given early sight of this document to TBI, a spokesperson for the DSIT said: “We make no apologies for regularly engaging with stakeholders. It is standard practice to share embargoed information with them ahead of announcements.” The TBI spokesperson said: “It is standard practice for governments to consult experts and engage a wide range of stakeholders when shaping policy. The AI opportunities action plan rightly drew on our published work, as the footnotes make clear.” Quick Guide How to contact our investigations team Show The best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.

1d2d46f8ae10,Fifa seeks advice over banning league games staged overseas amid regulations redraft,,"Fifa has begun redrafting its regulations on staging domestic league games in foreign countries and is seeking legal advice over whether it can ban them. World football’s governing body would like to outlaw the practice but will be guided by legal opinion in its first review of the relevant regulations for 11 years. A source involved in the process said Fifa was working towards making its rulebook more robust with a view to new regulations being ready early next year. This week Uefa blamed the “relevant Fifa regulatory framework” for its decision to allow Villarreal v Barcelona to take place in Miami in December and Milan v Como to go ahead in Perth in February. That is understood to have caused considerable irritation at Fifa because under existing regulations it is not their decision to make. The regulations were written in 2014, when domestic leagues moving matches to overseas territories was not regarded as a live issue after the collapse of Premier League plans for a 39th game in 2008. The then Premier League chief executive Richard Scudamore’s proposal for an “international round” was ahead of its time, but fans were outraged and it was not pursued elsewhere. Fifa can block what its rulebook refers to as an “international match” only if the correct processes are not followed. The rules state that such matches must be authorised by the football associations of the participating clubs and of the territory where a game is to be played and by the respective confederations. La Liga and Serie A gave their approval at the start of the season before passing the matter to Uefa, which provided its ruling this week. The issue now rests with the host FAs – the US Soccer Federation and Football Australia – and their respective confederations, Concacaf and the Asian Football Confederation. La Liga has scheduled Villarreal v Barcelona for Inter Miami’s Hard Rock Stadium but US Soccer’s approval is not guaranteed because there are concerns that Major League Soccer would suffer commercially if European and possibly Mexican league games could also be staged in the country. Fifa is working towards its regulations being more clearcut despite concerns over its legal position. The US-based promoter Relevent Sports brought an anti-trust lawsuit against US Soccer in 2019 after a request for Barcelona to play Girona in Miami was denied the previous year, with Fifa named as co-defendants. skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Football Daily Kick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of football Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

4e6d1e88c516,TikTok influencers fuelling parallel market for unlicensed weight-loss drug,,"An online parallel market for an unlicensed weight-loss drug is being fuelled by TikTok fitness influencers and sellers on WhatsApp , a Guardian investigation can reveal. Retatrutide, which is still in clinical trials, is being advertised by social media influencers for its supposed fat-burning effects. Followers are urged to message the accounts privately for supplier links, as well as being provided with discount codes. Separately, there is a thriving trade on Telegram , where groups with thousands of members share “before and after” photos, injection guides and claims of next-day UK delivery. Sellers advertise the drug there before directing customers to WhatsApp for transactions. Retatrutide is an experimental injection developed by the US drugmaker Eli Lilly. The drug targets three gut hormones – GLP-1, GIP and glucagon. Early trials suggest it could help patients lose up to a quarter of their body weight. Nicknamed the “triple G”, the drug is being hailed online as the next Ozempic. However, doctors and pharmacists have warned that the sale of what is still an unlicensed drug in the UK is a cause for concern and could result in users injecting products of unknown origin. Some said the popularity of retatrutide could be linked to the rising cost of licensed weight loss products such as Mounjaro. Selling retatrutide on TikTok or Telegram is illegal in the UK, as it is an unlicensed drug that cannot be marketed or supplied for human use under the Human Medicines Regulations 2012. TikTok accounts of the influencer Jon Kluth and @MappyMyGains. Composite: TikTok Some influencers try to sidestep the rules by referring to the drug as a “research chemical” or citing it as “not for human consumption”. Retatrutide is not a controlled drug, but promotion and supply can still breach medicines, advertising, and consumer laws, risking fines, prosecution or prison. The TikTok influencer Jon Kluth, who is based in the US and has 226,500 followers, posted on the 26 June an update on his journey taking what he called “reta” for four weeks and that said followers could use “code Jon” to purchase it. He then links to an account that sells peptides called Halfnattys. When asked for a comment, Kluth did not respond and the account was taken down. Another account with a UK influencer called @MappyMyGains talks about retatrutide as a “gamechanger” on 21 September, and when followers ask where he gets the drug from he says “pm me mate”. He did not respond to a request for a comment. Another promoter called @clairejoy86 posted videos captions “day 10 of Reta … ” to the background track of the song Manchild by Sabrina Carpenter. Those who comment are told to message her for supply information. She did not respond to a request for comment and instead the account was taken down. The TikTok account of @clairejoy86. Composite: TikTok According to TikTok, the social media company has removed violative content and banned associated hashtags and search suggestions. It said it was dedicated to keeping the platform safe and invest in strengthening enforcement strategies. The Guardian also found groups with up to 9,000 members selling retatrutide using Telegram’s built-in discovery tool, which works like a public directory. Typing “retatrutide” instantly brings up channels with thousands of members, filled with photos of weight loss, glowing testimonials and step-by-step guides for mixing or injecting at home. Within minutes of joining one group, a seller posted WhatsApp details, where most transactions take place. The seller sent an instruction manual and promised delivery within 48 hours. When asked whether the product was genuine, one seller said: “You can’t be sure.” Another shared a photo of a supposed laboratory certificate. None asked about weight, medical conditions or previous experience. Inside these groups, posts show black plastic parcels with Royal Mail labels, claiming to contain new batches. One message read: “It took eight of us to load them this morning.” Buyers can choose between powder vials, mixed at home with sterile water, or pre-filled pens typically sold at £160 for 20mg. When asked how long a pen should last, sellers give conflicting answers ranging from a few weeks to “depends on your body”. A spokesperson for Telegram said it actively moderated harmful content on its platform including content that encouraged the “misuse of controlled medications”. It added that it removed “millions of pieces of harmful content each day”. Eli Lilly said retatrutide had not been reviewed or approved by any regulatory agency in the world. Photograph: Bloomberg/Getty Images Jason Murphy, the head of pharmacy at Chemist4U, said unregulated imports could be dangerous. “People are injecting substances they can’t verify. Even if the science behind retatrutide is sound, these online versions may not contain what they claim,” he said. Dr Crystal Wyllie of Asda Online Doctor linked the surge in demand to recent price rises for approved weight-loss drugs such as Mounjaro. “With costs increasing, patients are turning to social media. But counterfeit injections are extremely risky. You can’t be certain what’s inside or whether the environment they were made in was sterile,” she said. Her team has already seen patients harmed by self-injection from unverified sources. “We understand the frustration, but buying from Telegram or WhatsApp is gambling with your health,” said Wyllie. “These substances could be contaminated or incorrectly dosed.” A spokesperson from Eli Lilly said retatrutide was in phase 3 clinical trials and had not been reviewed or approved by any regulatory agency anywhere in the world. “Therefore at this time no one can sell [it] for human use,” they said, adding that any product “falsely representing itself as a Lilly investigational product not yet approved … may expose patients to potentially serious health risks”.

b09c54768647,AstraZeneca makes deal with Trump to lower drug prices and avoid tariffs,,"Donald Trump announced a deal with the British-based drugmaker AstraZeneca for a “most-favored-nation” drug-pricing model aimed at making prescription medicines more affordable and avoiding the administration’s tariff threats. The company will sell some medicines at a discount to the government’s Medicaid health plan in exchange for tariff relief, similar to a drug-pricing pact reached last week with Pfizer. Trump began the Oval Office announcement on Friday evening by boasting that he would have struck the deal sooner, but “we were interrupted by a rigged election”. AstraZeneca CEO Pascal Soriot, who was in attendance, said that during tough negotiations to reach a deal, Trump and his team of officials had “really kept me up at night”. The deals set a framework the White House will use to try to reach its goal of lowering US prescription medicine prices. The president sent letters to 17 leading drugmakers in July telling them to slash prices. Pfizer and AstraZeneca are the first two companies to reach a deal with the administration. Under the agreement, AstraZeneca will charge most-favored-nation pricing to Medicaid, while guaranteeing such pricing on newly launched drugs, Trump said. That involves matching the lowest price offered in other developed nations. “For many years, Americans have paid the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs, by far,” Trump said, adding that the new deal may cut prices to “the lowest price anywhere in the world. That’s what we get.” Trump went on to repeat the wildly false claim that the discounted prices for American consumers would reduce the price of prescription drugs by up to 1,000%. As Daniel Dale of CNN explained : “Cutting drug prices by more than 100% would mean that Americans would get paid to acquire their medications rather than paying for them.” A health economist, Timothy McBride, told the network Trump’s claims are “just not logical”, since a 500% price reduction would mean that a drug that now costs $100 would be available for free, with consumers given a $400 rebate. The actual deal with AstraZeneca includes cutting prices for the government’s Medicaid health plan for low-income Americans and discounted prices through a “TrumpRx” website, the president said. Pfizer previously agreed to drop prescription drug prices in the Medicaid program for lower-income Americans to what it charges in other developed countries in exchange for relief from tariffs threatened by Trump. More than 70 million people are covered by Medicaid, the state and federal government program for low-income people. Drug spending in that program is dwarfed by that of Medicare, which covers people aged 65 and older or those with disabilities and is not included in Friday’s announcement. The Medicaid program already receives the lowest drug prices in the US, so the additional savings may be modest, said Craig Garthwaite, a professor at Northwestern University’s Kellogg School of Management. “If you look at AstraZeneca’s portfolio, I don’t think there are a bunch of drugs that exist where that’s going to involve them giving a very big discount to Medicaid,” Garthwaite said. Americans currently pay by far the most for prescription medicines, often nearly three times more than in other developed nations, and Trump has been pressuring drugmakers to lower their prices to what patients pay elsewhere or face stiff tariffs. Last month, Trump threatened 100% tariffs on drugmakers, increasing pressure on the pharmaceutical industry to agree to price cuts and shift manufacturing to the US. “The tariffs were a big reason he came here,” Trump said of AstraZeneca’s CEO Soriot. AstraZeneca’s Pfizer‑like deal may spare it tariffs, but will not move the needle on US rising health insurance premiums and out‑of‑pocket drug costs, said Rena Conti, an associate professor at Boston University. “It’s good for the companies, and has very uncertain if any benefit for Americans struggling with the affordability of prescription drugs,” Conti said.",https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/10/trump-astrazeneca-drug-prices,Business,BBC,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b07c6d3e737bf36c7572722325449448276937aa/258_0_3298_2639/master/3298.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=e363f01cdd4e0c0e24fc2b3dd120a6dc",2025-10-10T23:51:58+00:00,92124b39fc87c2b283ef05518fe907f0adcf4bd5
b671a2fd2f7a,"No survivors in Tennessee explosives factory blast, officials say",,"There were no survivors in the blast that obliterated part of an explosives factory in rural Tennessee , authorities said on Saturday. The families of 18 people had been waiting anxiously on Saturday as their loved ones had been feared dead since explosions ripped through the plant near McEwen in western Tennessee early on Friday. The initial toll had been believed to be 19 people but that figure was later revised. The Humphreys county sheriff, Chris Davis, spoke to the public and media early on Saturday afternoon and revealed that authorities were assuming that anybody who was inside the building that exploded the day before was dead.

Photograph: Vantor/AFP/Getty Images Davis said the tragedy was even “more devastating” than had been thought. In the close-knit community, he and other members of law enforcement and many in the community know people who were victims of the disaster. The blast was felt for miles as it leveled a building at the 1,300-acre headquarters of Accurate Energetic Systems (AES), which is located in the tiny community of Bucksnort, just south of McEwen, about an hour’s drive west of Nashville. “More than 300 people have been through almost every square inch of this facility, and at this time, we’ve recovered no survivors,” an emotional Davis told reporters early on Saturday afternoon. “It’s a great loss to our communities.” Officials did not offer a precise death toll but have previously said 18 people were unaccounted for. Davis confirmed the operation had shifted from rescue to recovery and that investigators would use DNA testing to confirm the identities of those who are assumed to have died. Investigators, including agents from the FBI and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, were still working to determine the cause of the explosion, officials said. The presence of explosives and other ordnance at the property has made searching the scene complicated. Initially, first responders were not able to get close to the scene of devastation because of secondary explosions. In a statement on Friday, the company thanked first responders but did not indicate a possible cause. Humphreys county sheriff Chris Davis tells reporters no survivors were recovered from the blast, in Bucksnort, Tennessee, on Saturday.

AES develops, manufactures and stores explosives for “military, aerospace and commercial demolition markets”, according to the company’s website. The headquarters includes eight production buildings and a quality lab. A small ammunition explosion at the plant in 2014 killed one person and injured three, according to local news reports.

e46fc8b42012,‘Death to Spotify’: the DIY movement to get artists and fans to quit the music app,,"T his month, indie musicians in Oakland, California, gathered for a series of talks called Death to Spotify , where attenders explored “what it means to decentralize music discovery, production and listening from capitalist economies”. The events, held at Bathers library, featured speakers from indie station KEXP, labels Cherub Dream Records and Dandy Boy Records, and DJ collectives No Bias and Amor Digital. What began as a small run of talks quickly sold out and drew international interest. People as far away as Barcelona and Bengaluru emailed the organizers asking how to host similar events. A Death to Spotify event at Bathers library in Oakland, California, on 23 September. Photograph: Denise Heredia The talks come as the global movement against Spotify edges into the mainstream. In January, music journalist Liz Pelly released Mood Machine, a critical history arguing the streaming company has ruined the industry and turned listeners into “passive, uninspired consumers”. Spotify’s model, she writes, depends on paying artists a pittance – less still if they agree to be “playlisted” on its Discovery mode, which rewards the kind of bland, coffee-shop muzak that fades neatly into the background. Artists have long complained about paltry payouts, but this summer the criticism became personal, targeting Spotify’s billionaire co-founder Daniel Ek for his investment in Helsing, a German firm developing AI for military tech. Groups including Massive Attack, King Gizzard & the Lizard Wizard, Deerhoof and Hotline TNT pulled their music from the service in protest. (Spotify has stressed that “Spotify and Helsing are two separate companies”.) Mood Machine: the Rise of Spotify and the Costs of the Perfect Playlist by Liz Pelly. Photograph: Hodder In Oakland, California, Stephanie Dukich read Mood Machine, heard about the boycotts, and was inspired. Dukich, who investigates complaints against the city’s police, was part of a reading group about digital media at Bathers library. Though she is not a musician, Dukich describes herself, along with her friend and art gallery worker Manasa Karthikeyan, as “really into sound”. She and Karthikeyan decided to start similar conversations. “Spotify is enmeshed in how we engage with music,” Dukich says. “We thought it would be great to talk about our relationship to streaming – what it means to actually take our files off and learn how to do that together.” Death to Spotify was born. The goal, in short, was “down with algorithmic listening, down with royalty theft, down with AI-generated music”. Karthikeyan says the responsibility of quitting Spotify lies as much with listeners as artists. “You have to accept that you won’t have instant access to everything,” she says. “That makes you think harder about what you support.” But will either musicians or listeners actually have the nerve to actually boycott the app longterm? Several famous musicians have pulled their catalogues from Spotify with big, headline-grabbing announcements over the years, only to quietly come crawling back to the platform after some time. One of the app’s most popular artists, Taylor Swift, boycotted the service for three years in protest of its unfair payment practices but returned in 2017. Radiohead’s frontman. Thom Yorke, removed some his solo projects for the same reason in 2013, calling Spotify “the last desperate fart of a dying corpse”; he later put them back. Spotify’s end game is for you not to think about what’s playing Will Anderson of Hotline TNT Neil Young and Joni Mitchell left the app in 2022, citing the company’s exclusive deal with anti-vax podcast host Joe Rogan; both Canadian singer-songwriters contracted polio as children in the 1950s. They, too, later restored their catalogues on Spotify. Eric Drott, a professor of music at the University of Texas at Austin, says the new wave of boycotts feels different. “These acts are less famous. For years, artists knew streaming wouldn’t make them rich but needed the visibility. Now there’s so much music out there, people are questioning whether it’s doing much for them.” Will Anderson, frontman of Hotline TNT, says there’s “a 0% chance” his band will return. “It doesn’t make sense for true music lovers to be on there,” he says. “Spotify’s end game is for you not to think about what’s playing.” When the band sold their new record Raspberry Moon directly through Bandcamp and a 24-hour Twitch stream, they sold hundreds of copies and “generated thousands of dollars”. Manasa Karthikeyan (left) and Stephanie Dukich. Photograph: Eva Tuff Others such as pop-rock songwriter Caroline Rose are experimenting too. Her album Year of the Slug came out only on vinyl and Bandcamp, inspired by Cindy Lee’s Diamond Jubilee, which was initially available only on YouTube and the filesharing site Mega. “I find it pretty lame that we put our heart and soul into something and then just put it online for free,” Rose says. Rose is a member of the Union of Musicians and Allied Workers (UMAW), an advocacy group formed at the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic to protect music workers. Joey DeFrancesco, a member of the punk rock band Downtown Boys and co-founder of UMAW, says the group “unequivocally supports artists taking agency, holding corporations accountable, and making splashes [such as taking music off Spotify] to push back at the company”. At the same time, DeFrancesco says, that kind of individualized boycotting has its “limits”. “What we try to do in the labor movement and at UMAW is to act collectively,” he adds. Examples include UMAW’s successful campaign (alongside the Austin for Palestine Coalition) to pressure the music festival South by Southwest to drop the US army and weapons manufacturers as sponsors for the 2025 event, and the Living Wages for Musicians Act, sponsored by representative Rashida Tlaib, a bill that would regulate Spotify payouts to artists. The Death to Spotify organizers say their goal is not necessarily to shut the app down. “We just want everyone to think a little bit harder about the ways they listen to music,” Karthikeyan says. “It just flattens culture at its core if we only stick to this algorithmically built comfort zone.”",https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/oct/12/spotify-boycott-artists,Business,BBC,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/eaf4cf4e2b16069b9f551d2c1cec86d72b8d7f40/557_0_4993_3992/master/4993.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=5dd877fe3e50f7f289cd58c1e1dc8fb7",2025-10-12T14:00:54+00:00,39e0d645b752f0d6bb4d3b03217b8ae244cda5e9
54c2f780925b,What price loyalty? UK supermarket cards rated,,"Got washing to do? Would you rather pay £16 for Ariel washing pods or £8? Thirsty? How about £5 or nearly £8 for a dozen Diet Cokes. Hungry? £2.50 a pop for Pringles or £1.75? The lower prices are among the current “top picks” for Tesco Clubcard holders – and it’s a similar story in other big supermarkets. With the cost of groceries rising, it no longer makes sense to shop without joining a loyalty scheme when it is on offer. That explains why 24 million UK households now have a Clubcard. Tesco says the deals mean shoppers save up to £375 off their annual grocery bill compared with its regular prices. Sainsbury’s claims its Nectar scheme can save more than £450. The widespread use of loyalty discounts has gradually seduced even the sceptical, with 76% of consumers now in a scheme, according to Mintel. The market researcher says close to 60% of us subscribe to four or more, helping to stretch the definition of loyalty. Nick Carroll, the Mintel director of retail insight, says in the current tough economic climate “instant savings” are important. “We’re in a period of very high food inflation, and that means people want savings now, not in six months.” Carroll suggests the loyalty schemes which are a new spin on store promotions “do save customers money”. But if they weren’t there, the big supermarkets “would still need to be price competitive”. During the cost of living crisis the sudden fashion for loyalty card price cuts attracted the scrutiny of the Competition and Markets Authority . The CMA went on to review 50,000 products with loyalty price options and found 92% offered a saving against the supermarkets’ usual price. It concluded that shoppers in supermarket loyalty schemes can make “genuine savings”. However, the watchdog also offered some advice: “Our review has shown that loyalty prices aren’t always the cheapest option, so shopping around is still key.” We’ve rated the current crop of supermarket schemes, and given them an overall score based on upfront discounts, rewards and other perks. Tesco The Tesco Clubcard works on a point-based system. Photograph: True Images/Alamy You earn one point for every £1 spent on shopping at Tesco. You can also accrue points at its other businesses such as its fuel stations and Tesco Mobile but the qualifying spend varies. A point is worth 1p when converted into Clubcard vouchers, which can be spent in Tesco or exchanged for twice their face value at more than 100 “reward” partners, including Pizza Express and Legoland. More important these days is its “Clubcard prices” promotion. With 10,000 deals every week the offers claim to save a Tesco regular £375 on their annual grocery bill. Pros Members-only prices include a discount on Tesco’s popular meal deal – the price recently increased to £3.85 but is £4.25 for non-cardholders. Tesco uses your data to serve up personalised discounts, while a new “Tesco Tuesdays” deal offers film fans up to four standard 2D Cineworld tickets for £5 each (or £2.50 in Clubcard vouchers at double their value). Cons Some would argue it is no longer in your interests to shop at Tesco without a Clubcard as it involves paying over the odds for your groceries. Also the rewards are stingier these days – at one point you could cash in vouchers for four times the face value. Overall rating 8/10 Sainsbury’s Argos is part of the Sainsbury’s Nectar scheme. Photograph: Michael McHugh/PA Shoppers earn one Nectar point for every £1 spent in-store or online. A point is worth 0.5p and can be spent in blocks of 500 (worth £2.50). You can also collect (and spend) points elsewhere as the scheme boasts 500-plus partners including big names such as British Airways and Marriott Bonvoy. With 27 million users, Nectar has taken the fight to Clubcard. The supermarket claims that “Nectar Prices” can save you more than £450 a year. It says Nectar Prices save you £323, plus potentially another £169 based on the average weekly saving from “Your Nectar Prices”. The latter is its personalised pricing offer, providing up to 10 weekly deals based on your shopping habits. Pros Sainsbury’s says Nectar Prices alone can save customers a chunky £13 on an £80 basket of shopping. Also with lots of other companies, including big high street brands such as Argos, as part of the scheme, it is possible to collect points on a big chunk of everyday spending. Cons In the same vein as Tesco, it is mad to shop there without a Nectar card. With a Nectar point worth 0.5p to Clubcard’s 1p, you need to spend twice as much to earn vouchers. However, with lots of ways to collect points this could balance out. Overall rating 8/10 Asda The Asda Rewards app. Photograph: mundissima/Alamy For Asda Rewards you have to download an app – there is no physical card available. Users earn pounds rather than points when they complete “missions”, which may involve shopping a certain number of times or buying particular products. (Sample missions: spend £5 on ready meals, or £7 on sports drinks, to earn £1.) These pounds go into your “cashpot” and are converted into vouchers to spend at Asda. There are about 6.4 million active customers. Pros Asda says some customers earn hundreds of pounds a year by completing all the missions, linking up their Asda credit card, using the various coupons and so on. The money can be spent on your shopping, so saves on the things you want to buy. Cons You pay the full price upfront and get money off later rather than an immediate discount. It is only available via an app. Overall rating 4/10 Lidl The Lidl Plus app. Photograph: True Images/Alamy The app-based loyalty scheme Lidl Plus gives you access to special offers that refresh weekly – current offers include 27% off Rubicon mango juice and 20% off granola. You can also get personalised coupons in the app that are based on your shopping habits – you need to opt in to these. There’s “Coupon Plus”, which unlocks rewards such as a free in-store “bakery sweet treat” when you spend £10 in a month, and 10% off your next shop (up to a maximum discount of £20) if you spend £250 in a month. Pros As well as immediate discounts it offers “exclusive discounts and benefits” from its partners, such as £65 off holiday bookings with Jet2holidays and up to 40% off cinema tickets. In July the retailer announced it would be introducing a new self-scanning feature within the Lidl Plus app. It will let customers scan products as they shop, track their spending and savings in real time and complete their purchases at a self-checkout terminal, all through the app. Cons The consumer group Which? is among those to have highlighted Lidl Plus as a scheme that is only accessible via an app, with an email address also required. That means the big savings available via the scheme are off-limits to those who cannot or do not wish to go digital. You have to actively opt in to get some of the savings. Overall rating 7/10 Co-op The Co-op offers a membership scheme. Photograph: Andy Rain/EPA You pay a one-off £1 to become a member of the Co-op (and can claim this back against your first in-store offer). This gets you a virtual and physical card that gives you some discounts and other perks. There are some members-only prices – recent deals include 65p off Mr Kipling Lemon Slices and 70p off Co-op Fairtrade chocolate – and access to discounts that price-match 100 products to their Aldi equivalent. You can also choose two of several weekly personalised offers, based on your shopping habits. These may include £1 off your shop or money off specific items. To add some fun, there are in-app games with vouchers for prizes, as well as a monthly prize draw – you get an entry for each £5 you spend. Pros You can save money straight away with some of the offers. You get a say in how the Co-op is run and can help choose a local charity for the business to support. It is also available to 16- and 17-year-olds, unlike other schemes. Cons It costs £1 to join; not all Co-op societies are involved. Overall rating 5/10 Waitrose There was delight among shoppers when Waitrose brought back its free hot drink offer. Photograph: David Gee 4/Alamy With 4.6 million members, the benefits of the supermarket’s My Waitrose scheme include personalised money-saving vouchers, free hot drinks and 20% off selected service counter products such as “big cheese Thursday” and “fish Friday”. Pros Free hot drinks. It caused outrage when this element was dropped during the coronavirus pandemic and its return at the start of this year was met with joy. You need to have your reusable cup on you but given the price of coffee these days it’s a freebie that’s not to be sniffed at. Cons The proposition feels underwhelming compared with the might of Clubcard and Nectar but a current trial in 18 shops called “little treats” suggests it could be about to become more generous. The trial offers shoppers up to three “little treats”, such as a free product, or money-off voucher each month, based on how much they spend. Overall rating 6/10 Marks & Spencer The Marks & Spencer Sparks storecard. Photograph: Michael Melia/Alamy Marks & Spencer says Sparks is about giving customers “treats and thank yous for shopping with us”. These include personalised offers across its clothing, home and food departments, and there is also a birthday treat that could include Percy Pigs, Swiss truffles or prosecco (if you have supplied your birthdate). There is also a coffee loyalty scheme in its cafes and a baby club called The Parent Hood with offers such as 10% off babygrows for new parents. Pros Sparks clothing discounts are worth keeping an eye out for as they can result in a big saving, especially for families with growing kids, and with its womenswear feted in the fashion press, it can help bring down the cost of a new outfit. Customers can also donate to the causes they care about, with M&S donating 1p to their chosen charity every time they buy something. And come on … who doesn’t want a free bag of Percy Pigs on their birthday? Cons: On a day-to-day basis it doesn’t feel there’s a compelling reason to scan your card at the till but it’s worth checking the app and loading the latest offers as, particularly for clothing and home, these can result in welcome savings. Overall rating 4/10 Morrisons Every week Morrisons offers a range of products at a More Card price. Photograph: Mark Collinson/Alamy The More Card offers a mixture of loyalty prices, targeted offers and the chance to earn points that are turned into vouchers once you have accrued enough – you need to build up 5,000 points, which you can then turn into £5. Every week a range of products are offered at a More Card price – some of these are straightforward price cuts, while others are multi-buy offers that only apply if you are a member. You earn five points for every product you buy and can also opt into “points boosters” so that when you buy particular products you will earn extra points towards a voucher – for example, you might be offered 400-1,200 points on spending on Branston products. Pros There are some upfront savings, although these do not really stand out from the other offers and discounts being advertised. You can choose to donate your points to the charity Marie Curie. You can earn extra points towards vouchers when you shop with partner retailers including eBay, Dunelm and Deliveroo. Cons There are not as many immediate discounts as available via Nectar and Clubcard – each week the number of items at More Card prices is in the hundreds rather than thousands. You have to build up £5 worth of points before you can get the money, and the points expire after 12 months. Overall rating 6/10 The Which? view: not all discounts are equal Every month the consumer group Which? compares the average price of shopping across eight of the UK’s biggest supermarkets. In September the cheapest store for its shopping list of 71 items was Aldi. The discounter does not have a loyalty scheme. For a bigger trolley load of 186 items, it found that Asda continued to be cheaper than shopping at Tesco with a Clubcard and remained one of the UK’s cheapest supermarkets. (Aldi and Lidl are not included in this comparison as they have a smaller range of products compared with the other supermarkets.) Reena Sewraz, the Which? retail editor, says: “Supermarket loyalty cards can be a useful way to save money but our research shows that not all discounts are as good as they appear, and while most people have signed up to at least one, millions of people can’t access loyalty prices at all because of age limits or digital requirements. That means deals on everyday essentials aren’t always as fair or inclusive as they should be. “The best approach is to use loyalty cards where you already shop, but don’t rely on them for the lowest prices. Compare across supermarkets – Aldi and Lidl often come out cheapest – and only stock up on items you were planning to buy anyway. That way, you’ll be sure to benefit from real savings.” This article was amended on 12 October 2025 to correct details of the Co-op loyalty scheme. The £1 joining fee is paid once, not annually; and this fee can be claimed back against the cost of your first in-store shop. Also, two offers can be chosen each week from several personalised selections.",https://www.theguardian.com/money/2025/oct/11/uk-supermarket-loyalty-cards-prices-rated-clubcard-nectar,Business,BBC,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9e579a8aa4523cc0361450eed1807e35b515987e/385_0_3172_2538/master/3172.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=8c4440cae2e003663bc5d453968b1b54",2025-10-11T06:00:18+00:00,4092195e9fd9d66bfea78fe84a50fc08f7f5ef04
6d3d1976f20f,‘It gets a bit dirty after 2am’: overtourism debate centre stage as Abta meets in Mallorca,,"T he swish seafront hotels and freshly planted palms on the gleaming promenade might tempt any unwary holidaymaker to book in for Mallorca’s Calviá beach. But step out the back door and the resort is still firmly, as it is better known, Magaluf: boozed-up Britain in Spain , with cocktails by the pint. Mallorca got most of the Balearics’ 3.5 million UK visitors last year: for some residents, far too many. The island has become emblematic of the most heated debate in travel: overtourism – and how to tackle it. The island’s Calviá region, home of Magaluf, this week played host to the annual Abta convention for Britain’s tourism industry. And tourism doesn’t get much more industrial than here. Straight out from an evening bash at the upmarket Nikki Beach club, a short walk through British pubs, kebab shops and purveyors of I ❤️ DOGGY STYLE T-shirts led delegates to the party end of the Strip, where bar ambassadors come out in force to lure in the punters. “Beer and two shots, four euros?” one offers. The Guardian declines. The man reconsiders: “Titties?” Prominent signs in English advise €300-€400 (£261-£348) penalties for nudity, fighting and drunkenness on the street. On an October weeknight, the patrolling police aren’t overstretched – but it’s early yet, only midnight, and as one seasoned resident warns: “It gets a bit dirty after 2am.” Street signs in English warning of fines for behaviour along the Magaluf Strip. Photograph: Gwyn Topham/The Guardian But the main business was in the Abta conference hall. Debates on overtourism and homilies on “slow travel” peppered the agenda for an industry grappling with the realisation that, despite the tantalising invitations on the Strip, not everyone wants them there. Mallorca is one of many destinations where locals have demonstrated against overtourism: this June, thousands marched through the capital in protest. But diagnoses of the problem – and potential remedies in a country whose annual flow of Britons exceeds all others – divided the convention. The strategy in Spain ’s new marketing campaign is chasing diversification rather than numbers: urging visitors to go inland, stay longer, try things such as “astrotourism and oleo tourism”, watching the next eclipse from a parador and sampling the olive oil. Steve Heapy, chief executive of mass market holiday operator Jet2, read the runes: “They want less tourists, but they want them to be richer. I don’t think it’s very fair. Why should holidays be only available to a certain subset of the population?” Prices in lesser-visited Galicia up north were even cheaper, Spain’s tourist office protested. UK director Manuel Butler says: “Like fast fashion, we have had fast tourism … We have to slow down, have more contact with people and explore more deeply the destination.” Tourism should be “resilient, inclusive, and beneficial to visitors and residents alike” – and places such as Magaluf, he says, “have to target a different clientele, people are who not looking to get drunk and make a noise. It’s the reality.” A decade-long strategy in Palma has massively increased its stock of small upmarket hotels for year-round breaks; it is bidding to become Spain’s next European capital of culture. Calvía and Magaluf have been following on a similar path: 80% of the hotels are now four or five star. Tens of millions of euros have been invested in cleaning up and improving the beach. And, as Calvía’s mayor Juan Antonio Amengual Guasp proudly told the auditorium, Magaluf now hosts a literary festival. It is a difficult balance for a place reliant on tourist income, with expats also a significant population; Amengual says Magaluf has “achieved a harmonious relationship between tourists and residents over the decades, and that has not changed.” But, he concedes, local discontent with tourism was “a reality” worldwide. English breakfast in Magaluf. Photograph: Schoening/Alamy The UK managing director of the travel giant Tui, Neil Swanson, was conciliatory: “They are in charge, right? Clearly we’re bringing money into the local economy, but it’s got to work for you in other social ways, and maybe not all tourism has. It needs to feel right for the local community, and for the guests coming in.” Abta’s chief executive, Mark Tanzer, says: “If you can extract more value that’s good.” But, he adds: “If they don’t want us, we won’t go. People like Jet2 will fly their planes somewhere else.” Heapy says the anti-tourism protests were having an impact, albeit small, after headlines about kill-a-tourist graffiti in Tenerife: “We’ve had many people writing into us and ringing our call centre saying, is it safe to go to Spain?” skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Business Today Get set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morning Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He says the word overtourism was really describing “poor tourism management”, citing private rentals such as Airbnb as the bigger problem. “Licensed tourism, people going on a holiday, staying in a hotel etc, it’s perfectly easy to manage it – you know how many people are coming.” Spain hopes trips will spread over longer seasons as hotter summers shift demand. Visitor numbers from January to May this year were 9% higher than in 2019, while the peak summer months remained static. Heapy is unconvinced: “People want that Mediterranean holiday in the summer months. I live in Manchester. It’s pretty grim – it’s cold, dark and wet. I want to get away to the sun, and if it’s hot, well great.” Others sense further change ahead. “You’ve got to look to see what’s coming,” says Cathy Sasson, owner of Pirates, a Magaluf landmark whose “swashbuckling immersive dinner show” (★★★★★ – the Daily Star) claims to have entertained 4 million people over 40 years. “A few years ago nobody served calamari. Now if you’re in a restaurant and it didn’t have salt and pepper squid you’d be disappointed.” Pirates sticks resolutely to one meal: chicken and chips with corn on the cob, even for its late-night adult show. But Magaluf, she says, is “not what it was in the old days”. Is she sad? “No – my dad would never let me out!” Nonetheless, she says: “No one wants people to stop drinking. We’re Brits, we go on holiday, and we like a drink. But it’s how they come and how they drink.” On the Strip, the lunchtime after the night before, barmaid Emma is opening up at Lennons pub and putting the bins out. “I think it probably will change,” she says, smiling a little sadly. Only one punter is here this early, Steve Davis, 75, from Coventry, holidaying to visit family here.

Why ‘Goldilocks’ jeans are having a moment",,"When it comes to fashion power struggles, there is no greater battle than the one between baggy and skinny jeans. But now a new style is emerging, or is it an old one? The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link. Learn more . Goldilocks jeans – ie straight cut – have made a comeback. Think Robert Redford in Three Days of the Condor, rather than Jeremy Clarkson’s bootcut Top Gear era or an indie band’s painted-on pip-squeezers. Leon Hedgepeth, a menswear writer who coined the term “Goldilocks jeans”, describes the style as “not too skinny, not too baggy – just right”. Levi’s’ bestselling jeans of all time – the 501, worn by everyone from Marlon Brando to Steve Jobs and Kate Moss – best encapsulates the shape. Straight talking … the Apple co-founder Steve Jobs in 2011. Photograph: AP Anne-Catherine Lepas, the vice-president of merchandising at Levi’s Europe, says the brand defines a straight cut such as the 501 as running evenly from hip to ankle, “creating a clean, effortless look that suits almost everyone”. Sales of straight-cut jeans are up 30% year on year at John Lewis, with top sellers including a £260 pair from the US label Frame. On Thursday, the British department store chain released a collaboration with the designer Rejina Pyo . While a cropped fluffy jacket was tipped to be a favourite from the collection, instead the straight-cut jeans in a dark-blue wash are soaring to the top of the sales chart. Elsewhere on the high street, six years after Marks & Spencer launched its Sienna straight-cut jeans, it is once again a bestselling style. Its recent Stovepipe iteration – which features a higher waist and less elastane, meaning it does not give as much, so hangs straighter – is also in demand. Lights, camera, fashion … Robert Redford frequently wore straight-cut jeans on and off screen. Photograph: David Parker/Alamy This shift to normality points to consumers’ growing fatigue with fashion’s trend cycle. Micro trends that start on social media, often with the suffix “-core” – such as “Barbiecore” and “cottagecore” – have accelerated this shift even further, with some shoppers feeling constantly outmanoeuvred. As a result, some consumers are giving their wardrobe a hard reset with a return to timeless basics. So less boom boom and more bore bore. A pair of jeans such as the 501s, which originated in 1873 and was commonly worn by miners, fulfil the brief. On Friday, Levi’s reported that revenues grew 7% to $1.5bn (£1.1bn) during its third fiscal quarter. skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Fashion Statement Style, with substance: what's really trending this week, a roundup of the best fashion journalism and your wardrobe dilemmas solved Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Meanwhile, the designer Jonathan Anderson stuck to his signature style – vintage Levi’s – as he took a bow after his Dior womenswear debut at Paris fashion week. He has also included a pair of normies in his collaboration with Uniqlo, which launches next week. Alongside trend fatigue, Hedgepeth credits 90s nostalgia and economic uncertainty with driving interest in normie denims. “A sluggish economy has everyone thinking twice before dropping £500 on novelty pants. Straight-leg jeans are the antidote: timeless, unfussy, and a safe bet that won’t make you regret not buying into the next skinny v baggy denim war.”",https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2025/oct/11/baggy-skinny-or-neither-why-goldilocks-jeans-are-having-a-moment,Business,BBC,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e2289c30e521e28cf5a47c240224a237384089a2/0_581_4379_3503/master/4379.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=a15c8b53da3bc6ec762f0410970e33ac",2025-10-11T07:00:17+00:00,e48aa95935fd095c296403fb7f50bf14779f6c15
9478114a4784,The non-profit helping people from all over the world to become successful game developers,,"G amescom, the annual video game convention held in Cologne, Germany, is a unique event. It not only draws hundreds of thousands of players to pack out vast convention halls each year, but it also hosts professionals, offering them a chance to get their games into the hands of fans, and gives industry hopefuls a shot at passing their résumés to developers. For those based outside the US, it is the biggest event of the year by far. It is the International Game Developers Association (IGDA) Foundation’s first year here, and executive director Alyssa Walles is excited. The IGDA Foundation provides professional development for underrepresented and marginalised people hoping to enter the video game industry, a crucial service considering the many barriers prospective producers, developers and writers face. Though Walles is fairly new to the IGDA Foundation, having joined three years ago, she is a video game industry veteran. She knows how crucial it is to help those who aren’t born into privileged situations, who can’t afford to travel across the globe to conventions, or have not had traditional schooling in computer design or coding. Gamescom hosts video game fans and industry professionals. Photograph: Imago/Alamy “I was part of the launch team of PlayStation in Europe, and I was the only woman in the room most of the time,” Walles says. “So I am so happy to see that change.” But she knows there is more work to be done. The IGDA Foundation started by funding trips for a select group to the annual Game Developers Conference in San Francisco, an expensive endeavour that often excludes hundreds of developers from marginalised communities or more remote regions of the world. When the Covid pandemic redefined video game events, the IGDA Foundation had to get creative – that’s when former executive director Nika Nour came up with the Virtual Exchange, a six-week online programme that pairs grantees with a veteran game industry coach. Out of hundreds of annual applications, the IGDA Foundation selects grantees from three main pillars: games career professionals looking for more senior roles, professionals trying to transition into the games industry and recent graduates. Alyssa Walles of the IGDA Foundation. Photograph: Courtesy IGDA Foundation Walles says: “My favourite example of someone in our cohort who has work experience but is trying to break into the games industry is this young man from Nigeria. He’s a home builder, he’s project managing every day, building houses – and he codes. He wants to take that project management experience and become a producer in video games.” For Walles and many other industry veterans who become mentors with the IGDA Foundation, it is about using their experience to ensure the industry has a strong and diverse future. “I’m 65, I’m not afraid about saying that … I’m on the back end of my career, and I’m here to give back,” she says. But the IGDA Foundation, like so many other programmes dedicated to making the video game industry and tech spaces more equitable, has faced frustrating challenges in the last few years. After meteoric growth during the pandemic, the industry has seen record redundancies. Companies are telling Walles they don’t have money for the foundation, which she finds hard to believe (“I know you have $5,000”), and though the IGDA Foundation isn’t government-funded, the Trump administration and Elon Musk’s “department of government efficiency” (Doge) have attacked diversity, equity and inclusivity institutions, which forces them to rethink how they market their programme and how to approach potential donors. “There have been several nonprofits that have had to close in our space. So far, we are not close to that. I worry about it every day,” Walles admits. “I think, how do I get to the people who have made a lot of money in video games and want to support that next generation?” 2025’s Virtual Exchange in action. Photograph: Courtesy IGDA Foundation But the IGDA Foundation, with Walles at the helm, is not afraid to get creative. Last year, she saw a story in a newsletter about how a solo developer made significant money from a single piece of downloadable content (DLC) sold in a Steam bundle. “I reached out to the IDGA Foundation’s alumni network and said, ‘I want to do a Steam event with DLC,’ and someone stepped forward to manage it. We created Download for Charity, an event we had in May – we had 24 games participate and raised $24,000,” Walles says. She has also organised game jams with unlikely collaborators and a recent porting initiative to help developers get their games on to Android phones. This dogged pursuit of funding is a testament to Walles’ dedication to the programme and to the marginalised people it serves. Walles’ hope for the future of the IGDA Foundation is simple: “We just want enough money to sustain us so we can provide these programmes for the people who need them around the world.”",https://www.theguardian.com/games/2025/oct/09/igda-the-non-profit-helping-people-from-all-over-the-world-to-become-successful-game-developers,Business,BBC,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/50ea177a6d263fb3f439ae50adb35fe40a6a0b11/263_186_3510_2808/master/3510.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=94c82c76caae6adc3729ac02f7989857",2025-10-09T14:53:43+00:00,d9509ddebda210bf529401bdb5a377764ec26621
75bc6f130354,‘We don’t want to be a toy town’: has Brexit sunk this historic UK fishing fleet?,,"A small flotilla of gaily coloured fishing boats line the shingle beach at Hastings, East Sussex. Behind them are the bulldozers that shunt them into the waves and beyond, in neat rows, are black wooden fishermen’s huts and fish stalls, where on a good day teenage daughters, wives and retired skippers sell some of the day’s catch. This is the Stade, a Saxon word for “landing place” from where wooden boats have set off since before William the Conqueror arrived in 1066. But a decline in Britain’s fishing industry has hit many coastal communities hard. Hastings, home to one of the UK’s oldest fleets and the largest beach-launched fleet in Europe, is one of the worst hit. The fleet, which had 53 registered boats in 2015, has 18 today, a drop of 66%. Of them, most lie idle, the fishers say. “Fishing has nosedived here,” says Peter White, 67, who has fished since he left school at 15. “A lot of people have left. From here all the way up the eastern channel as far as Whitstable. Harbours are empty, boats are gone. Fishing is on the floor. These boats haven’t been at sea for a month.” No one is at sea today, due to westerly winds, which worsen the further out you go, he says, and even on a good day, there’s fewer than eight active. These small “under 10” metre boats are the backbone of the UK industry; they represent 79% of the fleet and reportedly provide half of catch-related jobs. But in England between 2008 and 2022, they declined in numbers by 22%, nearly double the 13% fall in larger boats, according to research by Newcastle University and the University of Plymouth published this year. Over the same period, vessels under 10 metres also spent 43% fewer days at sea. The fishers in Hastings who spoke to the Guardian blamed multiple factors for the decline, including marine heatwaves affecting fish populations, unsustainable quotas that dictate what and how much they can fish and larger trawlers further out in the North Sea “hammering” fish stocks. In White’s family, fishing goes back a century. But neither of his two daughters fish, and with most on the Stade in their sixties, he fears he is one of Hasting’s last fishers. “It’s going to die out,” says White. “Fish shops are disappearing right left and centre.” He is semi-retired, but still fishes with his nephew, Darren, 49, on his boat, the RX56, the Sussex Girl. He loves being at sea more than he ever did. “I have a pension and no mortgage to pay, so there is no pressure,” he says. “Most fishermen don’t do it for the money, they do it for the life.” T he Hastings Fishermen’s Protection Society, set up in 1831 to preserve the fishing community’s right to work from the beach, has helped train 10 young people over the past decade. All except one have left for better-paying jobs elsewhere. Shane Ball, 32, whose father is a fisher, left reluctantly in November for a job as a maintenance man. “All I ever wanted to do was fish,” he says. “I skippered for 12 years. “But it came time to get a mortgage. When you go out to sea, you have to pay the fuel and the crew. Sometimes, you are literally burning the diesel for nothing.” Shane Ball out at sea on a 12-hour fishing trip with his father, Robert ‘Podgy’ Ball, on their boat, the Bethan Louise, in 2017 The cost of fuel has rocketed, as have other costs after health and safety rules imposed on the small boats by the Maritime and Coastguard Agency in 2023. In May, the struggling sector was dealt a further blow after a “ Brexit reset ” deal between the European Union and the UK. Fishers condemned the deal as a “betrayal” because it granted large EU vessels 12 years of access to UK territorial waters, right up to where the small boats fish at six miles from the coast, a year before the existing deal was due to expire. Alongside the deal, the government announced a £360m fund to modernise the fleet, boost exports and support communities. Mark Ball, 62, who fishes with his son Jamie, 30, the youngest of the Hastings crew, says earning have plummeted in the past decade. “The only way we can maintain the boat now is if we take it out of savings.” Mike Cohen, the CEO of the National Federation of Fishermen’s Organisations, says the Brexit reset deal “was a big blow” that surrendered the best prospect fishing communities had to grow. “You’ve got our little boats fishing alongside 30m-plus Spanish, French, Portuguese boats and Dutch and Danish in some places too, that can stay at sea in all weathers, fish around the clock and stay at sea for a week or fortnight in weather that our boats can’t get out from port. They can’t compete. “We gave away access to waters and we got absolutely nothing back.” Cohen has called for a national strategy for fishing and marine food production, and to deploy the £360m fishing and coastal growth fund where needed. Last week, scientists from the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea, advised a 77% reduction in fishing of North East Atlantic mackerel to prevent population collapse . Conservationists point to a lack of a unified management plan between countries to prevent overfishing. Catch limits between EU countries and the UK in the region have consistently exceeded limits recommended by scientists. Rob Pearson, chief fisheries and conservation officer for the Sussex Inshore Fisheries and Conservation Authority, argues that good inshore management is one of the reasons England has one of the largest smallscale fleets in Europe , but it is undermined by what is happening farther offshore. The changes in health and safety rules have also had a “massive impact” on recruitment, he says. “The pathway to becoming an inshore fisherman was already a struggle. It’s harder to take a crew because of the safety requirements.” B ack in Hastings, Lucy Phillips, 55, and skipper Paul Stanley, 59, are sorting nets on the deck of the RX11, Christine, on the Stade. Phillips, who worked as a translator before taking up fishing four years ago, says: “It makes me sad it’s declining. “We don’t want to become a toy town, where people leave the boats and it looks like a museum,” she says. Paul Stanley, the skipper, and his partner, Lucy Phillips, with their boat, Christine In the old days, the Stade was “like a big family”, says Kevin Bollen, 64. “Everyone knew everyone else. As kids we used to go and pull the boats off the beach. They would give us a few fish and we went round the houses selling them. When you got to my age, you would be the ‘boy ashore’, help bring the boat in and get a quarter of a share. “This used to be one of the richest fishing grounds in the UK. Now, you’d be really pushing yourself to take £15,000 a year.” Bollen sold his boat after a cancer diagnosis more than a decade ago. “Another 10 years, I don’t think there will be boats out.” Asked what will happen to the Stade when the last fisher leaves, Bollen replies: “It’ll be turned into a car park, won’t it?” Kevin Bollen, right, with the skipper and boat owner, Darren Coglan, in the latter’s shed",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/oct/09/hastings-brexit-sunk-historic-uk-fishing-fleet,Business,BBC,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/36d1b798b9d3ec0870da0e53093b9f70dc257989/263_0_2338_1871/master/2338.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=7bc253de6f9174255d69eb8ba9d29cda",2025-10-09T11:00:22+00:00,717cce3e557783520f97f14e4eae2a10a3f67d6b
8a7394901c47,There’s a £1 idea that could save small music venues. Is Live Nation holding it back?,,"G rassroots venues are the bedrock of the country’s music industry, giving artists a place to hone their craft, and punters a place to see them perform up-close – possibly before a bigger, starrier career. But since the start of 2023, more than 150 of these venues have permanently closed their doors – about 16% of the entire UK sector. In this moment of crisis, a solution is on the table: a proposed £1 levy on tickets for all arena and stadium shows with more than 5,000 capacity could raise up to £25m annually for the grassroots venues facing closure. A poll of about 8,000 music fans found that 93% supported the initiative by the charity Music Venue Trust, and a spokesperson from the Department for Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) says it “fully supports” the rollout. Over the last year, major artists such as Coldplay, Ed Sheeran, Pulp, Diana Ross, Katy Perry and Radiohead have all committed to it, alongside venues such as the Royal Albert Hall and ticketing platform Tixel. Sam Fender’s 2024 arena tour raised more than £100,000 via the levy, which has recently been distributed to 38 independent venues. “The idea that money from shows in big venues supports the smaller venues, where it all starts for musicians like me, is just common sense,” Fender has said. But a huge funding gap remains. For concerts in 2025, more than 22m of 24.2m eligible tickets are sold without the £1 contribution, according to industry data shared with the Guardian. And while the early picture for 2026 shows positive momentum, with uptake rising to 28%, this still translates to millions in missing potential support. “The industry is very good at adding fees where the company adding the fee is the beneficiary, and not quite so efficient when the money is for the wider ecosystem,” says Mark Davyd, chief executive of Music Venue Trust. ‘The idea that money from shows in big venues supports the smaller venues is just common sense’ … Sam Fender. Photograph: Emma McIntyre/Getty Images for Coachella Steve Dix of Hackney venue Paper Dress Vintage backs the levy as an important step in stabilising grassroots venues across the country, and is blunt about what he thinks is its main obstacle. “Some of the big players such as AEG Presents, SJM and Kilimanjaro Live have already stepped up and shown real leadership,” he says, referring to three of the big promoters that arrange arena and stadium gigs. “But the truth is that until the biggest [promoter] in the world, Live Nation, does the same, progress will be held back. Their participation is the missing piece that would turn this from a promising initiative into an industry standard.” According to data presented to the government’s Business and Trade Committee by the Association of Independent Festivals (AIF), Live Nation controls 66% of the UK’s major event ticket market in 2025, either directly or through its subsidiary companies such as Ticketmaster. Back in May, former minister for creative industries, Sir Chris Bryant, called on Live Nation to “step up” regarding levy adoption, and “help in relation to Ticketmaster and … any of the acts they are representing”. Bryant also called on more artists to sign up to the levy, and suggested that the government would act “if this weren’t to be proceeding”, enshrining the £1 levy in law. But Davyd claims a statutory government levy would be a “blunt instrument”, taking years to legislate, with the risk of funds being misdirected. In contrast, he argues the voluntary model “can be delivered very fast, and can be very effectively distributed.” A spokesperson for Salford experimental venue The White Hotel agrees: “As soon as the government gets involved in anything you know they’re just going to make a pig’s ear of it.” (DCMS did not comment on this criticism.) The money is already making a difference on the ground. Fender’s donation, for example, has been distributed via the Liveline Fund – a Music Venue Trust and Save Our Scene initiative – allowing venues such as Paper Dress Vintage to replace a broken mixing desk, Glasgow’s Sub Club to repair their iconic “bodysonic” dancefloor, and providing The White Hotel with “vital” financial support. This fund is a precursor to the Live Trust , a charity established by the wider industry in January 2025 to be the official administrator for the £1 levy, set to begin distributing funds in February 2026. Diana Ross, one of the artists who has contributed to the fund for grassroots venues. Photograph: Jim Dyson/Getty Images When asked whether it would indeed “step up” and add the £1 levy to all of the major concerts it promotes, Live Nation did not directly respond, but affirmed that “supporting new talent is vital to the future of music” and that it was “proud to champion emerging artists and grassroots venues … We support the aims of the grassroots ticket levy, and it’s encouraging to see artists we promote already opting in for their shows.” The £1 levy has its critics. Some argue that the cost should not be passed on to fans, who already face escalating ticket prices. “There has been something of a mixed response,” says Mike Grieve, Sub Club’s managing director, noting a feeling that “major concert promoters are already asking their customers to dig deep to pay for tickets”. However, he says the additional funding is a “massive help” for smaller operators, particularly as razor-thin margins are hampering their ability to book lesser-known or experimental acts. “It has become unsustainable for promoters to take any creative risk,” he adds. Davyd suggests that when a promoter links with a ticketing company to sell tickets, the ticketing company should be asking whether the absence of the £1 levy was a deliberate choice or an accidental omission. But without Live Nation taking the lead, “it’s difficult to see how a statutory levy is avoided”, Davyd claims. “If the market leader in an industry refuses to do what is now government policy, we should expect the government to take different action.”",https://www.theguardian.com/music/2025/oct/09/1-ideasave-small-music-venues-live-nation,Business,BBC,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/320bd2218ccf6b75eb9a8e94253e9470a75886bb/974_0_5703_4562/master/5703.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=8f3ff15648299b39bfc061184c0a6fca",2025-10-09T07:00:19+00:00,add07b529ae7a72535a478e41f8005d79731ee5e

e729bb2ce96f,From boom to backlash: has Taylor Swift lost her touch? – podcast,,"She is by any measure the biggest pop star in the world, which has made her ability to retain her relatable appeal all the more impressive. But this week Taylor Swift seems to have made a rare misstep. For decades her fans have watched her grow from a teenage country star to globally recognised billionaire, and she has taken them with her, thanks to her sharp lyrics about growing up, relationships and heartbreak. But it’s not just about the music. She has cultivated a unique connection with her Swifties, dropping clues in her music and content and encouraging them to decode it, explains the Guardian’s deputy music editor, Laura Snapes . And it has paid off. The Eras tour boosted the UK economy by £1bn. So when she released The Life of a Showgirl a week ago, the hype was intense. But something seemed to go wrong. The Guardian’s chief pop and rock critic, Alexis Petridis, gave it a two-star review, and many fans voiced their disappointment. Nor was it just with an underwhelming music release.

92da37633d5f,David Lammy rules out charging workers for employment tribunal claims,,"The justice secretary, David Lammy , has ruled out reintroducing charges for employment tribunals after a backlash from unions over the proposals. The Guardian revealed last week that ministers were considering a plan to charge workers a fee to take their bosses to court as part of negotiations in this year’s spending review. Trade unions responded with fury, labelling the idea a “disaster”. The Ministry of Justice declined to rule out implementing the proposal last week, saying only that “decision-making about the department’s spending and fees for the next few years following this summer’s spending review is ongoing”. But in a statement on Wednesday, Lammy, who is also deputy prime minister, said: “It’s a fundamental principle that everyone, no matter their income, should be able to get access to justice to challenge unfair behaviour at work. “It’s not just a basic right, it’s also fundamental to this government’s plan to make work pay. That’s why it will remain free to bring a case to an employment tribunal, ensuring everyone, no matter their means, can stand up for their rights at work.” Making a claim against an employer had been free since the tribunal system was established in the 1960s, until David Cameron’s coalition government introduced charges in 2013. Fees were then scrapped in 2017, after the supreme court ruled they were unlawful , after a case brought by the Unison trade union. Lammy added: “The Tory-Lib Dem coalition government tried to price workers out of justice with tribunal fees. Let me be clear, we will not.” Paul Nowak, secretary general of the TUC, welcomed Lammy’s announcement, saying: “No one should ever be priced out of enforcing their rights at work.” He added: “The Conservatives left the tribunal system and our courts in a mess with huge backlogs. Trade unions are ready to work with the deputy prime minister and other ministers to deliver a system that is fair, accessible and fit for the future. This includes unions helping workers resolve problems in the workplace, not the courts.” Labour’s employment rights bill includes sweeping changes to workers’ rights, which the unions have welcomed, but some business lobby groups have argued will add to the costs of hiring workers. The changes are expected to lead to an increase in tribunal cases. The Conservatives, under the leadership of the then prime minister Rishi Sunak, proposed a £55 fee for workers to make an employment tribunal claim , in plans made void by Keir Starmer’s general election victory. With significant delays and a shortage of qualified judges, the UK’s employment tribunal backlog has ballooned, with a queue of 45,000 single open cases at the end of March. In order to help tackle the backlog, the Ministry of Justice began recruitment for up to 36 employment tribunal judges in March, and it plans to hire another 50 next year.",https://www.theguardian.com/money/2025/oct/08/david-lammy-rules-out-charging-workers-for-employment-tribunal-claims,Business,BBC,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/837b2a1e272c7c0727a57adbdb7c7cf47d1df865/386_0_4207_3367/master/4207.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=74461910c8567906843e177fdf6bd768",2025-10-08T17:05:45+00:00,6d6589220d91afc6d194f571f2f4844e44fb148a
1229981d58c1,People in the UK: tell us how much money you have managed to save,,"The personal savings rate of UK households reached a record high in 2020 , during the first coronavirus lockdown. Since then, consumers have battled high interest rates and a persistent cost of living crisis, which has meant many householders have had to tap into savings to cope with rising costs. The number of individuals, for instance, who made an unauthorised withdrawal from a Lifetime ISA, and therefore paid a penalty fee, increased by 139% between 2020/21 and 2023/24. According to Finder, the average person in the UK has £16,067 in savings in 2025. However, 2 in 5 Britons (39%) have £1,000 or less in savings, and a quarter of Britons (23%) have £200 or less. 1 in 6 UK adults (16%) have no savings at all, equating to around 8.4 million people. 18% of millennials and people in generation X have no savings at all.

9c9280cd2cce,Ovo pricing change could double charging costs for some EV owners,,"Electric vehicle owners fear they will be left out of pocket after the energy supplier Ovo announced changes to a popular charging deal which could double the cost for some customers. Drivers who have an energy contract with the company can currently charge their vehicles at any time of day or night for 7p a kilowatt hour (kWh), making its Charge Anytime deal the cheapest on the market. From 4 November, however, the cost will soar to 14p a kWh unless they sign up to a new monthly plan, priced from £27.50 for an estimated 700-mile range. The plan also includes a voucher worth about 600 miles for use at public chargers. Ovo says the changes are a “new, easy way of paying”, but customers who drive fewer than 700 miles a month claim they will be left with larger bills. The monthly allowance cannot be carried over and the vouchers are not valid for all public charging providers. To qualify for the deal, drivers must be an Ovo customer, have a compatible EV charger and a smart meter. EV owner Chris Goddard was informed of the changes a week after switching his energy supply to Ovo to make use of the Charge Anytime deal. “It’s an insult,” he said. “One of the things that persuaded me to buy an electric car last month was Ovo’s charging rates. The cheapest monthly payment plan will work out at more than a 100% rise for some.” Customers on Ovo’s forum said the company had “lost the plot” and accused it of misleading them with an email announcing “a great opportunity”. The monthly plans are priced according to average miles rather than kilowatt hours, unlike the current tariff, making it difficult for drivers to compare the costs. A range of energy providers offer pay-as-you-go charging deals for less than 9p a kWh, but the cheap rate only applies to night charging during specified hours. Consumer campaigners are concerned the new tariff will disadvantage drivers with low monthly mileage at a time when the government is seeking to encourage more households to shift to electric vehicles. “Any increase in electricity rates is unwelcome news, particularly at a time when energy prices remain staggeringly high,” said Andrew Capstick, utilities editor at MoneySavingExpert.com. “Ovo’s Charge Anytime tariff was one of only a very few that let you charge your vehicle for cheap at home at any time of the day.” skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Business Today Get set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morning Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Its latest accounts reveal that it has failed to meet the financial resilience standards set by the regulator Ofgem and is being forced to recapitalise. Ovo denied that financial constraints had prompted the tariff change. It said they were in response to customer requests for a simplified payment system. “Charge Anytime offers flexibility to charge wherever and whenever EV drivers need, while benefiting from the certainty of a fixed monthly cost,” a spokesperson said. “We know it won’t suit everyone, so we’re waiving exit fees for customers who wish to leave.”",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/oct/08/ovo-pricing-change-could-double-charging-costs-for-some-ev-owners,Business,BBC,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8b0dea997bb938047ea9e894230b2bfee328ade6/222_0_6037_4833/master/6037.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=4bb83606c71bdcac518ed5c7f2275179",2025-10-08T11:52:32+00:00,fdd654c869e7a3e2be797713ce2a12d2c800a918
c590ae8b44fd,Post-ministerial jobs watchdog closes as part of UK government ethics shake-up,,"The much-criticised watchdog that scrutinises the jobs UK ministers can take after leaving office will be formally scrapped on Monday as part of a wider shake-up of the ethics structure in government. The Advisory Committee on Business Appointments (Acoba), described by critics as fundamentally toothless, has been closed, a Cabinet Office announcement said, with its functions taken over by two existing regulators. At the same time, a new organisation called the Ethics and Integrity Commission will oversee the work of a series of other regulators, the centrepiece of what Keir Starmer has promised will be a robust new approach to government and to any ministerial misdeeds. Also from Monday, a previously announced ban on severance payments for ministers who lose their job after a serious breach of the ministerial code comes into force. In the change, first revealed by the Guardian in July, former ministers who take up new jobs in a serious breach of the rules for post-government appointments could be asked to hand back any severance payment. The standard severance payment for a departing minister is a quarter of their ministerial salary, as long as they are not given a new frontbench post within three weeks. For cabinet ministers this equates to just under £17,000. Under the new system, those who serve for fewer than six months will be expected to not take the payment, while those who get a new ministerial job within three months will be asked to not take a salary until the end of that three-month period. With Acoba abolished, Sir Laurie Magnus, Starmer’s independent adviser on ministerial standards, will adjudicate on job appointment rules for ex-ministers. The Civil Service Commission, which regulates recruitment into the civil service, will do this for former civil servants and government special advisers. The Ethics and Integrity Commission is, however, not an entirely new organisation, but takes on the work of the existing Committee on Standards in Public Life (CSPL), which was tasked with giving the prime minister advice on broader ethical standards. The commission will be headed by the CSPL’s existing chair, Doug Chalmers, a former soldier who ended his military career as deputy chief of defence staff. In a letter to Chalmers marking the new commission, Starmer said one of the organisation’s tasks should be to make sure ministers and civil servants help other public servants meet their responsibilities under the still-to-be-passed Hillsborough law , which obliges them to act with honesty and candour and avoid cover-ups. The announcement said: “The prime minister has made clear public service is a privilege and is committed to showing how politics can be a force for good. The government’s manifesto pledge to set the highest standards in public life to restore trust between the public and politics.” Nick Thomas-Symonds, the minister of state for the Cabinet Office, said the Ethics and Integrity Commission “will play a central role” in ensuring the government delivers its pre-election promise to uphold the highest standards in public office. It remains to be seen how big an impact will come from a minor reorganisation of the framework for monitoring ethical standards, and the creation of a new, top-level watchdog, the job of which is not to enforce rules but to help make sure others to do so. As well as Magnus’s office and the Civil Service Commission, other ethics-related bodies for public life include the parliamentary standard commissioner, parliament’s Independent Complaints and Grievance Service, the House of Lords Appointments Commission, the Electoral Commission, the UK Parliamentary Standards Authority and the Registrar of Consultant Lobbyists.",https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/oct/13/post-ministerial-jobs-watchdog-acoba-closes-uk-government-ethics-shake-up,politics,BBC,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f4e0f6e9592219ca6ef63c15a28fd40b61bb4ad1/76_0_800_640/master/800.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=7ba1ceb6a291ec9bdae07a41760d90ec",2025-10-12T23:01:05+00:00,770c78e5a2008d50333622327bcc4d4f2d0b07f7
6a4a1569d80a,"Green party reaches 100,000 members for first time after Polanski becomes leader",,"The Greens in England and Wales have more than 100,000 members for the first time, the party has announced, a near-50% rise since Zack Polanski took over as leader last month. It puts them on a potential course to overtake the Conservatives and comes little more than a week after the Greens announced they had moved past the Liberal Democrats in membership numbers, getting to 83,500. If the same momentum continues, party officials say, they could be on course to become bigger than the Conservatives. Tory party membership figures are not made public, but recent reports say the total is slightly above 120,000. Such numbers do not necessarily translate into electoral success, with Labour having had a peak of more than 500,000 members under Jeremy Corbyn, who lost two general elections. And while one recent poll put the Greens at 15%, most such surveys have put the party nearer to 11% or 12%, not much changed since Polanski took charge. But the influx of members does point to Polanski’s apparent ability to galvanise attention and enthusiasm for a party that has often struggled to get its message across, with a mass of interviews, social media videos and TV appearances. The Greens’ surge has caused worries among some senior Labour figures, who believe it could take votes and seats from the party in next May’s local elections in England, particularly in some London boroughs. Polanski has repeatedly set out what he sees as the Greens’ ambition to supplant Labour. In a speech this month to the party’s annual conference, he said that without action Keir Starmer would “hand this country on a plate” to Reform UK. Responding to the new membership figure, Polanski said: “More than 100,000 people have now joined the Green movement. That’s 100,000 people who believe politics can be honest, fair and hopeful again. “When I was elected leader last month, I said that we’re not here to be disappointed with Labour but that we’re here to replace them. I was serious. Because while Labour talks about change, people can see in their weekly shop, their utility bills and crumbling services, Labour are offering more of the same. skip past newsletter promotion Our morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it matters Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

15b7fb4690af,"Coral reefs, ice sheets and Amazon rainforest approaching a tipping point due to global heating, report says",,"The earth has reached its first catastrophic tipping point linked to greenhouse gas emissions, with warm water coral reefs now facing a long-term decline and risking the livelihoods of hundreds of millions of people, according to a new report. The report from scientists and conservationists warns the world is also “on the brink” of reaching other tipping points, including the dieback of the Amazon, the collapse of major ocean currents and the loss of ice sheets. But some experts have questioned the report’s claims about the fate of coral reefs, with one saying while they are in decline there is evidence they could remain viable at higher temperatures than suggested. Tracing the worst coral bleaching event in recorded history – video Tipping points are recognised by scientists as moments when a major ecosystem reaches a point where severe degradation is inevitable. The world’s coral reefs are home to about a quarter of all marine species but are considered one of the most vulnerable systems to global heating. “Unless we return to global mean surface temperatures of 1.2C (and eventually to at least 1C) as fast as possible, we will not retain warm-water reefs on our planet at any meaningful scale,” the report says. Reefs at tipping point Coral reefs have been in the midst of a global bleaching event since January 2023 – the fourth and worst on record – with more than 80% of reefs in more than 80 countries affected by extreme ocean temperatures. Scientists say the event has pushed reefs into “uncharted territory”. The Global Tipping Points report, led by the University of Exeter and financed by the fund of the Amazon owner, Jeff Bezos, includes contributions from 160 scientists from 87 institutions in 23 countries. It estimates that coral reefs hit a tipping point when global temperatures reach between 1C and 1.5C above where they were in the latter half of the 19th century, with a central estimate of 1.2C. Global heating is now at about 1.4C. Without rapid and unlikely cuts to greenhouse gases, the upper threshold of 1.5C would be hit in the next 10 years, the report says. “We can no longer talk about tipping points as a future risk,” said Prof Tim Lenton at the University of Exeter’s Global Systems Institute. “The first tipping of widespread dieback of warm water coral reefs is already under way.” He said this was already impacting hundreds of millions of people who depend on reefs. The report points to reefs in the Caribbean, where marine heatwaves, low diversity and disease outbreaks have pushed reefs “towards collapse”. Experts agree that coral reefs need ‘aggressive’ action on climate change and improved local management. Photograph: Glenn Nicholls/AFP/Getty Images However, Prof Peter Mumby, a leading coral reef scientist at the University of Queensland in Australia, said he accepted reefs were in decline but there was emerging evidence corals could adapt with some reefs remaining viable even at 2C of global heating. He said coral reefs needed “aggressive” action on climate change and improved local management, but he was concerned some would interpret the report as saying coral reef habitats were heading for collapse, which was a position he did not support. He said he was worried society would “give up on coral reefs” if people think they can no longer be saved. skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Clear Air Australia Adam Morton brings you incisive analysis about the politics and impact of the climate crisis Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The game has changed and the response has to be really urgent.” He said there were some coral reefs that were known as refugia – places where climate impacts were not as pronounced – and protecting these places was paramount. “We have to make sure we have the seeds of recovery for a future world where we have managed to stabilise the climate,” he said. Dr Tracy Ainsworth, the vice-president of the International Coral Reef Society, said in many places reef ecosystems were changing and were either no longer dominated by corals, or were losing diversity. “The future of coral reefs is one of transformation, ecosystem restructure and new challenges,” she said. “Our challenge now is to understand how all of these different ecosystems are reorganising and how we can ensure they continue to support diverse marine life and communities.” In a statement, the Australian Institute of Marine Science said interpretation of global figures “should be taken with care” for two reasons – they masked significant regional variability and global temperatures had not stabilised “indicating there remains a narrow window of opportunity to act”. Earth entering a ‘danger zone’ Lenton said parts of the west Antarctic ice sheet and the Greenland ice sheet were “looking perilously close” to their tipping point, as they were losing ice at an accelerating rate. Loss of ice that is still attached to the land causes sea levels to rise. “We are going to overshoot 1.5C of global warming probably around 2030 on current projections,” Lenton said. “This puts the world in a greater danger zone of escalating risk of further damaging tipping points.” The Amazon – under pressure from the climate crisis and deforestation – was closer than previously thought to reaching a tipping point, he said. The report does offer some hope, saying there are likely “positive tipping points” in society – such as with electric vehicle adoption – that could also have runaway effects to rapidly reduce greenhouse gas emissions. “The race is on to bring forward these positive tipping points to avoid what we are now sure will be the unmanageable consequences of further tipping points in the Earth system,” Lenton said.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/oct/13/coral-reefs-ice-sheets-amazon-rainforest-tipping-point-global-heating-scientists-report,World,BBC,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4dd624f41bdd6c4af4f7a6bf17cf85c686169bb3/489_0_4838_3870/master/4838.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=8da31fb5eaa0310236ebafdc1bdf9949",2025-10-12T23:00:04+00:00,9747b912903d06b92babb9b506ba4e346ed2db1a
a2ec43748218,Generational shift as millennials make up half of new buy-to-let investors in England and Wales,,"Millennials now account for half of new buy-to-let investors in England and Wales, signalling a generational shift in landlords, while rents have dipped, according to a report. It is a surprise finding, as many millennials – people born between 1981 and 1996 – have struggled to afford a housing purchase, which means they are less likely than older generations to own their home . Even so, some have clearly fared better, and millennials are leading the charge in buy-to-let investment, according to analysis of Companies House data by the estate agent Hamptons. For the first time, millennials made up 50% of all new shareholders in buy-to-let companies set up so far this year. Five years ago, they made up 40% of buy-to-let shareholders. So far this year, three-quarters of shareholders in new companies were under 50 – up from 68% a decade ago. While tax rises and tighter regulations have prompted some landlords to sell up, the influx of younger investors has helped sustain landlord purchases. The share of homes bought by a landlord across England and Wales remained unchanged from the same time last year, despite an increase in the second home stamp duty surcharge. Landlords now pay a 5% surcharge as of April, up from 3% previously. Across the country, landlords accounted for 11.3% of property purchases in the third quarter, a small uptick from 11.2% a year earlier. Hamptons estimates that millennial landlords will create 33,395 new buy-to-let companies this year – more than twice the number incorporated in 2020. These purchases are increasingly concentrated outside the south of England, previously a property hotspot. Together, London, the south-east, south-west and east of England accounted for 34% of investor purchases across England Wales in the July-to-September quarter. In 2016, these regions accounted for 50% of purchases. Investors are increasingly trying to buy in the north of England, where yields are higher and cheaper properties mean stamp duty costs are lower. More than a quarter (28.4%) of homes sold in the north-east were bought by a landlord, compared with 8% in London. The average rent for a newly let home in Britain fell by 0.3% in the year to September – down £4 a month from £1,402 to £1,398, Hamptons said.

310b8e70959c,Energy firms complete UK’s first ‘hydrogen blending’ trial to power grid,,"Energy companies have injected green hydrogen into Britain’s gas grid and used the low-carbon gas to generate electricity, in a landmark development for the UK’s climate ambitions. For the first time in the UK, a 2% blend of green hydrogen was injected into the gas grid and blended with traditional gas to fuel the Brigg power station in North Lincolnshire which generated electricity for the power system. Blending hydrogen into the gas system has already taken place in controlled environments using decommissioned sections of the transmission system, but the first “real-life” test in the UK was carried out by British Gas’s parent company, Centrica, and National Gas, which owns Britain’s gas transmission system. The companies believe the test’s success shows the potential for hydrogen, which does not produce any carbon dioxide when burned, to cut harmful emissions from areas of the economy where other low-carbon options might not be available. Green hydrogen is produced by splitting water using electricity from renewable energy sources, with minimal emissions. It is seen as key to decarbonising energy-intensive industries – although there is fierce debate over its use, with claims that heat pumps powered by electricity are much more efficient. Gary Smith, the general secretary of the GMB union , said: “The success of this trial is a significant moment for our country’s energy future. It highlights the vital role that innovation across our industrial heartlands can play in creating highly skilled unionised jobs in working-class communities, an essential part of any credible plan to meet our net zero obligations.” Centrica and National Gas are urging the government to back the use of hydrogen blends of up to 5% in the UK’s gas system. Jon Butterworth, the chief executive of National Gas , said: “It’s another crucial milestone on Britain’s hydrogen journey, showing how blending can fuel our power stations and unlock new investment opportunities for producers. skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Business Today Get set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morning Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But she defied the odds thanks to a heart and lung transplant, and at the age of 53 she has become the UK’s longest-surviving recipient of such a procedure. Mitchell was diagnosed with Eisenmenger syndrome when she was 11. She had high blood pressure in her pulmonary arteries which caused an increased resistance to blood flow through the lungs, which led to irreversible lung damage and heart failure. Mitchell had her combined transplant at Royal Papworth hospital in September 1987, a procedure so rare that only about five are carried out in the UK each year. “Thanks to organ donation, I was given the gift of a normal life,” she said. “I think about my donor a lot, especially on the anniversary of the transplant. I think about their family and what their family must have felt at the time. “I just know my donor was a young female. Her family made that decision at a terrible time in their lives. I am so grateful. “It’s quite difficult to put into words how it feels to know I am now the longest-lived heart-lung recipient in the UK. It’s mixed feelings. Katie Mitchell on a treadmill during her recovery after her transplant Photograph: NHSBT/PA “People I know who had the same transplant have passed away in front of me, but it’s a blessing and amazing to feel I’ve had all this extra time. “I don’t really know why it has worked so well. Perhaps the immunosuppressants suit me well. Everybody has so many different reactions to the medications, and everyone has their own regimen.” There are currently 8,124 people on the UK transplant waiting list, including 12 waiting for a heart and lung transplant. Mitchell’s transplant is functioning well. She also had two kidney transplants from deceased donors in 1994 and 2015. Mitchell, from Sidcup in south-east London, said: “I went to an event at Papworth and there were a couple of young women who had their heart-lung transplants recently. skip past newsletter promotion Our morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it matters Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Marius Berman, the surgical lead for transplant at Royal Papworth hospital NHS foundation trust, said: “It’s fantastic to see Katie continuing to live life to the full, 38 years on from her transplant. “To see it succeed so profoundly is testament to the skill of many NHS teams, the generosity of donors and the resilience of patients like Katie. “Her journey offers real hope to others currently waiting for transplants and reminds us all of the importance of organ donation.”",https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/oct/13/katie-mitchell-becomes-uk-longest-surviving-heart-and-lung-transplant-recipient,World,BBC,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/206e4dd73f6964a698624078709d8e6a3d3701bd/0_368_1458_1167/master/1458.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=24c530120bd017633260b7ed4b1574b2",2025-10-12T23:01:04+00:00,8ef417b3669835ed5f06d77cf9928bb9ae86be1f
6c5cb34945c2,Trump says ‘war is over’ in Gaza as Israel awaits release of hostages,,"The war in Gaza has ended and the Middle East is going to “normalize”, Donald Trump said on Sunday as he flew to Israel , which was waiting for Hamas to release Israeli hostages as world leaders were gathering to discuss the next steps toward peace. “The war is over, you understand that,” Trump told reporters onboard Air Force One as he began a flight from Washington DC to Israel . Asked about prospects for the region, Trump said: “I think it’s going to normalize.“ A ceasefire between Israel and Hamas held in Gaza for a third day on Sunday ahead of the expected release of Israeli hostages and Palestinian prisoners and a scheduled address by Trump to Israel’s parliament. Thousands of Palestinians continued to travel north towards Gaza City, the focus of Israeli attacks over the past two months, hopeful the ceasefire would bring an end to the war. “Tomorrow is the beginning of a new path. A path of building, a path of healing, and I hope - a path of uniting hearts,” Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a televised statement. Such optimism was shared broadly. “There is a lot of joy among the people,” said Abdou Abu Seada, a resident of Gaza who added that the joy was tempered by exhaustion after two years of war that has destroyed much of Gaza. Government spokesperson Shosh Bedrosian said Israel expected hostages to start being released early on Monday morning with the 20 living hostages to be released together. In the event that hostages were released earlier, Israel was ready to receive them, she said. Their release is to be followed later by the handover of bodies of the remaining 28 deceased hostages. Under the ceasefire agreement, Hamas is due by noon on Monday to release the remaining hostages. They were taken captive on 7 October 2023 when the group’s militants launched the surprise attack on Israel that ignited the war. Israel is also to release 1,700 Palestinians who have been detained in Gaza since 7 October 2023, and 22 Palestinian minors, along with the bodies of 360 militants. Bedrosian said the prisoners would be released once the living hostages reach Israeli territory. Israel’s hostages coordinator, Gal Hirsch, said on Thursday a taskforce would be formed to help find the remains of any dead hostages that Hamas could not locate. Trump is due to arrive in Israel on Monday to address the Knesset, the parliament, before travelling to Sharm el-Sheikh in Egypt for a world leaders’ summit on ending the Gaza war. Mahmoud Abbas, the Palestinian Authority president, will also attend the summit, an Axios reporter said on Sunday, citing a senior Palestinian official. Trump’s Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner addressed a rally in Tel Aviv on Saturday, which many Israelis hoped would be the final one urging the release of hostages and an end to the war. The US, along with Egypt, Qatar and Turkey, mediated what has been described as a first phase agreement between Israel and Hamas for a ceasefire and the release of hostages by Hamas and prisoners and detainees by Israel. “For two years we [have been] waiting for this day for this moment ... All of us feel happy for the family, for the hostages, that finally ... we will see them,” said demonstrator Dalia Yosef, thanking Trump. Israeli defense minister Israel Katz said that once the hostages were returned, the military would destroy underground tunnels in Gaza built by Hamas. Palestinians returning to northern Gaza have described widespread devastation. Rescue workers warned there could be unexploded ordnance and bombs in the area. Amjad al-Shawa, who heads a Palestinian organisation coordinating with aid groups, estimated 300,000 tents were needed to temporarily house 1.5 million displaced Gazans. “We couldn’t believe the destruction we have seen,” Rami Mohammad-Ali, 37, said by phone after walking 15km (9.5 miles) with his son from Deir al-Balah to Gaza City. “We are joyful to return to Gaza [City] but at the same time we have bitter feelings about the destruction,” he said, describing seeing human remains scattered along roads.",https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/12/trump-israel-gaza-war-hostages,World,BBC,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ceaea82a5db7c9f1d8f75883bc050dd09d900186/363_0_6593_5274/master/6593.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=af44d96be16e4f5fff9878fc813fceb1",2025-10-12T22:45:16+00:00,a98f1c098a4a6d62dbbfd6b45635c49f3a140f84
fe38ba665e17,‘£850 to skip the queue’: how scammers are exploiting driving test delays,,"Criminals are cashing in on would-be drivers’ frustration over test delays by claiming they can help them skip queues and obtain licences without the need to do exams. Fraudsters are asking for hundreds of pounds for what they say are legitimate licences, claiming they have staff inside the government testing and licensing bodies working for them. In one scam seen by the Guardian, the fraudster asked for £850 for a driving licence, payable in instalments, claiming that a “team of DVSA-certified instructors” would process the buyer’s details. They claim the driver is enrolled in a test centre but will not have to sit the theory or practical test. Instead, they claim their staff submit test results through the system, which leads to the licence being issued. However, the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA), which issues licences, and the Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency (DVSA), which carries out tests, have warned that the promised shortcuts are scams designed to gather victims’ money and personal details. They have also warned that any documents that do arrive are counterfeit. Anyone found in possession of a fake driving licence could face up to 10 years’ imprisonment. Waiting times for tests have averaged about 22 weeks across Great Britain this year, with London drivers having to wait 24 weeks in many cases. The latest DVLA figures show 668,128 people had a practical driving test booked in Britain at the end of September, up from 579,138 a year earlier. Recent figures from the bank TSB showed that among its customers total losses linked to driving lesson and test fraud had doubled in a year, and victims had lost an average of £244 each. It found almost every recorded scam was carried out via a social media platform. The number of drivers who have fallen victim to scams around learning to drive is on the increase, according to TSB , which said recently that some of its customers had also been duped into buying fake driving lesson offers. What the scam looks like The fraudsters behind social media accounts seen by the Guardian encouraged prospective buyers to get in touch with them by WhatsApp. When contacted, one said that they had an “agent working on the DVLA system” who could obtain a full driving licence and passing certificates for the theory and practical tests. They said the cost would be £500, with £200 paid upfront and another £300 due once the licence arrived, which they said would be within four days. Another claimed to be a technician working on the DVLA database. They asked for £740 for an automatic licence and £850 for a manual one. One of the fraudsters asked how good the potential buyer’s driving skills were and whether they had any medical issues and points on their licence, which the fraudsters said was necessary to process their application. One asked for the screenshot of a provisional licence for the application. The accounts contacted by the Guardian requested payment via bank transfer. What to do The DVLA said it had found no evidence that any staff had been involved in such scams. “These accounts are not connected to DVLA and are recognised scams that attempt to obtain payment or personal information,” a spokesperson said. “Anyone concerned they may have been a victim of a scam should contact the police through Action Fraud straight away.” The DVSA said it had received a large number of reports about the scams, and promised documents usually failed to arrive. A spokesperson said: “These accounts are not connected to DVSA and are recognised scams that attempt to obtain payment or personal information. “We take all allegations about test standards and fraud extremely seriously. We fully investigate reports of any individuals who attempt to circumvent the testing process and have a robust process in place to ensure driving tests conducted by our examiners meet the required standard of assessment.” TikTok banned three accounts highlighted by the Guardian. “Our community guidelines are clear that we do not allow the trade or marketing of regulated, prohibited, or high-risk goods and services, nor do we allow attempts to defraud or scam members of our community,” a statement from the social media company said. Meta, which owns Instagram, removed two accounts using similar tactics that were pointed out by the Guardian.

47629cf4b5b2,Two legal challenges to Woodside’s North West Shelf extension filed on environmental and cultural grounds,,"Two groups have filed separate legal challenges to the federal environment minister’s approval of Woodside’s North West Shelf extension, one of the world’s biggest liquified natural gas projects. The Australian Conservation Foundation and Friends of Australian Rock Art have commenced federal court proceedings in a bid to have the decision overturned. The environment minister, Murray Watt, gave final approval last month to Woodside’s proposal to extend the life of its North West Shelf gas processing plant – on the Burrup peninsula in northern Western Australia – from 2030 to 2070. “We’re challenging the lawfulness of Minister Watt’s approval of this gas hub extension, which is the centrepiece of the most polluting gas project in the southern hemisphere,” ACF’s general counsel, Adam Beeson, said. Beeson said many Australians were “shocked” by Watt’s decision, with the group’s research estimating the project’s total emissions would be more than 13 times Australia’s annual emissions. Sign up: AU Breaking News email The ACF will argue the minister wrongly considered the economic benefits of the unapproved Browse gas project – a separate Woodside proposal to develop an untapped conventional gas field off the Kimberley coast – in his statement of reasons for approving the extension. The group will also argue the minister left critical details out of his decision, including approving the project without knowing the details of the gas it would process and the pollution it would cause, and that he failed to consider the physical effects of climate breakdown as an “impact”. “A child born today will be 45 in 2070. We will argue the minister was wrong to cite the claimed economic benefits of the proposed Browse gas project – which Woodside hopes will feed the gas hub, but which has not been approved – when he approved the North West Shelf extension,” Beeson said. Friends of Australian Rock Art’s case will assert the approval was invalid because the minister failed to properly take into consideration the economic and social harms that would result from ongoing damage to Murujuga heritage. The group also has a separate challenge running in the WA supreme court to the state government approval of the project. The government’s published statement of reasons for approving the project shows it agreed to weaken conditions it had proposed to protect world heritage-listed Indigenous rock art after Woodside argued it could be forced to shut the plant. The statement shows Watt accepted environment department advice that “multiple lines of scientific and other evidence” suggested industrial emissions were having a “significant adverse impact” on rocks in Murujuga, a cultural landscape in northern WA that is home to more than 1m pieces of rock art, known as petroglyphs. The minister also accepted advice that future pollution from the North West Shelf liquefied natural gas (LNG) processing facility could cause “degradation, damage, notable alteration, modification, obscuring or diminishing” of the area’s natural heritage. But the minister said in the statement of reasons that the final conditions for the project were “stringent” and he did not believe there would be an unacceptable impact on the area’s heritage values. Susan Swain, a co-convenor of Friends of Australian Rock Art, said the Murujuga petroglyphs and cultural heritage were unique in the world and priceless. “The Unesco world heritage site contains the oldest and most extensive rock art on the planet, with the earliest recorded depiction of the human face among its treasures,” she said. “The environment minister had to look at this heritage site and how to protect it, and we say that he failed to do that in accordance with the law.” Swain said the social and economic harms that would be caused by the government’s decision included “impacts on tourism, extreme heat and human health”. Watt declined to comment on the legal proceedings. A Woodside spokesperson said the company was aware Friends of Australian Rock Art had commenced legal proceedings. They said they were aware of ACF’s challenge to the same approval from media statements. “The federal government’s approval follows a comprehensive and extended assessment carried out by both commonwealth and state regulators in accordance with statutory processes,” they said. “The North West Shelf project extension was referred to the federal regulator on 18 November 2018 and was under assessment for nearly seven years. “Woodside intends to vigorously defend its position in these proceedings.”",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/oct/13/legal-challenges-woodside-gas-plant-north-west-shelf-extension-environmental-cultural-grounds,World,BBC,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1ca2bdf7608fe5bb1416d5a7e72e4d438ff90ae6/304_0_2829_2263/master/2829.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=4819ea2db268639f853e360d04a3c8cd",2025-10-13T03:21:09+00:00,fdab243f3a12a2c56ef5b0df877f1e6ffd53e339

The treasurer, Jim Chalmers, announced the surprise decision on Monday morning just three days after Anthony Albanese insisted Labor’s plan remained unchanged. The government’s plan to double the tax rate on superannuation balances above $3m from 15% to 30% has faced sustained attacked since it was announced in 2023 despite only affecting 0.5% of savers. The main criticisms were that the policy taxed so-called “unrealised gains” in addition to cash profit, and that the $3m threshold is not indexed, meaning more people will be affected as super balances increase over time. Sign up: AU Breaking News email Under a major rewrite of the policy, the government now intends to index the threshold up to $10m, scrap its application to unrealised gains and delay the start date until July 2026. The proposed 30% tax rate will remain for superannuation balances between $3m and $10m, after which a new 40% rate will kick in. The changes, which cabinet approved on Monday morning, represent a major backdown from the Albanese government after it failed to get the legislation through the Senate in the last term of parliament. Under a separate change, the government will increase the low-income superannuation tax offset from $500 to $810 and raise the eligibility threshold from $37,000 to $45,000 from 1 July 2027.

On Monday, Google and Microsoft appeared before a Senate inquiry on a range of age assurance and verification requirements being applied to social media and other aspects of the internet including search. Google’s senior manager of government affairs and public policy in Australia and New Zealand, Rachel Lord, told the inquiry the under-16s ban – which is expected to include YouTube – will have “unintended consequences” and won’t make children safer. Sign up: AU Breaking News email “The legislation will not only be extremely difficult to enforce, it also does not fulfil its promise of making kids safer online,” Lord told the inquiry. “YouTube has invested heavily in designing age-appropriate products and industry leading content controls and tools that allow parents to make choices for their families. “Forcing kids to use YouTube without an account removes the very parental controls and safety filters built to protect them across sport, music, creative learning and classrooms.” The company’s director of government affairs and public policy, Stefanee Lovett, was asked whether Google was lobbying the US government on the matter ahead of the prime minister’s planned visit next week. Lovett said her Google colleagues in the US had been alerted about a “range of issues” being dealt with in Australia, but could not say if the Trump administration was being lobbied. “We’ve noted, senator, that the Australian prime minister will be travelling to the US next week, and we’ve talked to some of our colleagues about a range of issues that we’re dealing with in Australia at the moment, so that they understand the position,” she said, in response to the question from the committee’s chair, Greens senator Sarah Hanson-Young. Lord told the committee the ban, due to come into effect on 10 December, would impact safer access to YouTube’s services. She also repeated Google’s claim that YouTube was not social media, but “a video-streaming platform that Australians use as a content library and a learning resource”. Lord said features such as no autoplay, break reminders and turning off personalised advertising would not be available to teens accessing YouTube in a logged-out state once the ban on under-16s holding an account is in effect.

Henderson said the inclusion of YouTube in the ban was a “betrayal” of young people, given the company had previously been given an exemption by the government when the legislation was developed and passed by the parliament last year. She said the Coalition – which campaigned for the broader under-16s social media ban – was receiving a lot of complaints about YouTube’s inclusion.

Donald Trump and Egyptian president Abdel Fattah al-Sisi will co-host a summit of more than 20 world leaders in Sharm El Sheikh on Monday, after the US president first visits Israel to speak at its parliament and meet families of the hostages. The summit’s aim is “to end the war in the Gaza Strip, enhance efforts to achieve peace and stability in the Middle East and usher in a new era of regional security and stability”, according to Egypt’s presidency. The impressive aims of the meeting are matched by a similarly impressive guest list, many of whom have played a vital role in securing the ceasefire and hostage release deal now in place. The continuing success of the agreement – and how closely the next stages match up to Trump’s 20-point peace plan – are all expected to be up for discussions at Monday’s summit. But who is going to the Gaza meeting – and, importantly, who’s not? The answers are in our explainer here: Trump questions if Blair will be part of Gaza peace team Donald Trump has questioned whether former UK prime minister Tony Blair will serve on a new “board of peace” that is intended to oversee the governance of Gaza. The US president’s comments come amid ongoing criticisms of Blair for his role in the Iraq war that began in 2003. “I’ve always liked Tony, but I want to find out that he’s an acceptable choice to everybody,” Trump said, without naming specific leaders who could be weighing in on his choice of Blair, Reuters is reporting. The Gaza peace plan floated by the White House last month listed Blair as a member of the proposed board. Former British PM Tony Blair.

ef5065acd905,IFS warns Rachel Reeves against ‘half-baked dash for revenue’,,"Rachel Reeves must avoid “a half-baked dash for revenue” or risk damaging economic growth as the chancellor seeks to close a large gap in next month’s budget, the Institute for Fiscal Studies has said. The tax and spending thinktank has warned there was a danger the chancellor would create “unnecessary economic damage” if she chooses to stitch together unrelated tax-raising measures to cut the shortfall in government revenues and keep within her fiscal rules. In a chapter from a report due to be published later this month, the IFS said Reeves could raise tens of billions of pounds in extra revenue without breaking Labour’s manifesto pledges, but cautioned that higher rates on longstanding, poorly designed taxes would have a detrimental effect on incentives to work, productivity and economic growth. “A budget focused purely on the politics could prove considerably worse on the economics,” the thinktank said. Reeves has ruled out increases in income tax, national insurance and VAT before the budget next month, which is being viewed as a make-or-break reset for the government after a torrid first 15 months in office . While there is potential to close the budget gap with spending cuts or higher borrowing, the chancellor has come under pressure to avoid using them to improve the UK’s financial position. Rebel Labour MPs have forced the government to backtrack on spending cuts, most recently reductions in universal credit payments. Meanwhile, the interest rate on government borrowing has remained high this year, deterring the chancellor from increasing debt levels. Treasury officials are understood to be considering several tax-raising options in an effort to close a spending gap of £20bn to £30bn. Adding to the need for higher tax receipts, Reeves is keen to double a near £10bn budget buffer to about £20bn to allow for greater flexibility when the public finances come under pressure. skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Business Today Get set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morning Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Analysis by IFS researchers for a chapter of the IFS Green Budget shows an increase in the tax on pensions, including levying national insurance on employer pension contributions and limits on the ability of retirees to access 25% of their savings tax-free, could raise billions of pounds. “Employer [national insurance contributions] could be levied in full on all employer pension contributions, and replaced with a 10% subsidy on all employer pension contributions. This would raise around £6bn a year,” the report said. The report said there was also a potential windfall of £10bn from closing a tax gap that had opened up in recent years. It said small businesses were paying only 40% of the tax they owed. “In 2029–30 terms, a corporation tax gap of that size would represent more than £24bn of forgone revenue; just returning the gap to 2017–18 levels could raise more than £10bn,” it said. Isaac Delestre, a senior research economist at IFS and an author of the chapter, said: “Revenue-raising seems likely to be a major goal of the coming budget. But if Rachel Reeves limits her ambition to collecting more revenue, she will have fallen short. “Almost any package of tax rises is likely to weigh on growth, but by tackling some of the inefficiency and unfairness in our existing tax system, the chancellor could limit the economic damage.

d5fc1c73bfa0,New Zealand accused of ‘full-blown climate denial’ over cuts to methane reduction targets,,"Environmental campaigners have accused New Zealand’s government of “full-blown climate denial” after it slashed targets for reducing emissions of methane, a potent greenhouse gas that contributes to global warming. New Zealand’s right-leaning coalition government outlined plans on Sunday to reduce methane emissions by between 14 and 24% by 2050, compared to 2017 levels. The previous target was between 24 and 47%. Farmers – who had taken issue with the previous target – praised the move, but scientists and opposition parties criticised it as “weak” and “unambitious”. Greenpeace’s New Zealand office said the policy shift “amounts to full-blown climate denial”. Amanda Larsson, a climate campaigner with the environmental group, said prime minister Christopher Luxon was “choosing ... corporate profits over our kids’ future”. Climate change minister Simon Watts said the government “remains committed to our domestic and international climate change commitments, including net zero by 2050. “Agriculture will continue to make an important and fair contribution to achieving this reduction,” he said. The government also confirmed that it would conduct a legislated review of biogenic methane targets in 2040, and impose no tax on agricultural methane emissions due to the threat of farm closures. It will also invest NZ$400m (US$230m) in methane-cutting technology. Watts said total agricultural emissions could fall by up to 14% over the next decade if 30% of farmers adopted technologies expected to be available before 2030. But Massey University climate mitigation expert Ralph Sims said there was “no guarantee” that scientific research would provide near-term solutions to biogenic methane, which include those belched out by the country’s five million cows and 23 million sheep. Agriculture accounts for almost half of New Zealand’s greenhouse gas emissions, according to government figures. Lawyers for Climate Action, an advocacy group, said the reduced target risked tarnishing New Zealand’s international standing. Jocelyn Turnbull, a principal scientist at government-funded institute Earth Sciences New Zealand, also said it could harm New Zealand’s “clean and green” image. But Federated Farmers of New Zealand, an agricultural lobby group, said the change was “long overdue”. President Wayne Langford said previous methane reduction targets had been “absolute madness”. “Farming families have been under huge pressure for a long time now – but it looks like that’s finally coming to an end,” he said.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/oct/13/new-zealand-government-accused-climate-denial-methane-reduction-targets,World,BBC,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/06242316cbb5a82e41fe78bee64dc4fa43752c37/564_0_4501_3601/master/4501.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=092c59e2e26315b9b116b51e0b83fee2",2025-10-13T04:04:55+00:00,1eff47f632cee18ce72c8d82aed44e12156c25ef
d4cc4ad05c40,Record number of babies born to foreign parents in Japan amid political row over migration,,"The number of babies born to foreign parents reached a record high in Japan in 2024, underlining rapid demographic changes that have propelled migration to the heart of the country’s political debate. More than 20,000 children were born to non-Japanese couples, accounting for more than 3% of all newborns, according to the health ministry – in stark contrast to another sharp fall in the number born to Japanese parents. The number and proportion of foreign newborns were both record highs, the Nikkei business newspaper reported , adding that the children were “starting to help dent the decline in births among Japanese people”. Japan is one of the fastest-ageing countries in the world and has struggled to raise its birthrate to the level needed to sustain the population, which currently stands at about 125 million. Its non-Japanese population has soared in recent years, as more migrant workers are hired to fill gaps in the labour market – a trend that has turned immigration into an election issue for the first time. The ministry’s data showed that 22,878 foreign children – defined as the offspring of non-Japanese parents or an unmarried foreign mother – were born last year. That is an increase of more than 3,000 from a year earlier, and represents a 50% rise from a decade ago, the Nikkei said. The number of children born to Japanese couples fell to 686,173 – a reduction of 41,115 from the year before. The contrasting trends meant non-Japanese newborns offset the decline in Japanese births by more than half and accounted for 3.2% of all births. By nationality, Chinese women comprised the single biggest group of foreign mothers followed by women from the Philippines and Brazil. The increase is a reflection of the sharp rise in foreign residents in Japan. The number of legal foreign residents has risen to 3.95 million, the immigration services agency said last week. Many are in their 20s and 30s and are more likely to remain in the country for longer and to have children. The diverse populations now found in many Japanese towns such as Ōizumi, home to dozens of nationalities , has prompted right-wing politicians to call for stricter immigration rules and better integration . In July’s upper house elections, the minor populist party Sanseito put in a strong performance after it campaigned opposing foreign workers. Sanae Takaichi , the new leader of the governing Liberal Democratic party who is hoping to be made prime minister this month, made immigration and “ badly behaved ” foreign tourists a key part of her election bid. But the labour shortage, combined with an ageing demographic, is expected to fuel more migration. The justice minister, Keisuke Suzuki, recently said the proportion of foreign residents could surpass 10% of the population by 2040 – three decades earlier than a National Institute of Population and Social Security Research forecast published in 2023. Experts have called on local authorities to do more to help foreign families. “Policies and help for foreign babies born here and their families are lagging in many localities, and most rely on nonprofit organisations,” Toshihiro Menju, a visiting professor at the Kansai University of International Studies, told the Nikkei. “We need policies to create a society where foreign-national children, when they grow up, speak Japanese, earn as much as Japanese citizens do, and can support their own families,” Menju aded, warning that otherwise “we are going to have a divided society”.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/oct/13/record-number-babies-born-foreign-parents-japan-political-row-migration,World,BBC,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f816aad82a5704b23866286b79ccf81491f920f7/515_0_3745_2997/master/3745.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=82cd102a4462159e16ca9969d1ef4564",2025-10-13T03:46:40+00:00,b7265784c63b1a7a4a61d184d2a92ea042f00d12
ece1511fbe9b,Victoria’s ‘major crime problem’ and ‘lack of trust’ in police sparks force’s biggest overhaul in years,,"Victoria police officers will spend less time doing paperwork and more time patrolling the streets in a bid to reduce crime and restore public confidence. The chief commissioner, Mike Bush, announced the biggest restructure of the force in a decade on Monday, which he said was in response to the state’s “major crime problem” and “the lack of trust and confidence” in police to tackle it. “In terms of those two very significant issues, we need to police differently. We need a reset. We need to reorganise ourselves,” Bush told reporters. The restructure will cut back on centralised commands and departments and reduce the “administrative burden” on frontline officers, as well as cutting the number of deputy commissioners from six to four, with one dedicated specifically to crime prevention. “We don’t have enough police on the frontline to prevent and respond to calls for service, because the way we’ve organised ourselves has kept a lot of them either in the back room or back at the station completing jobs that someone else should do on their behalf,” Bush said. It comes after crime data released last month showed the state’s crime rate had risen 13.8% year-on-year in 2024-25, with theft the fastest-growing offence. At the time, Victoria police announced a target to reduce serious and violent crime by 5% each year. A graph showing Victoria’s crime rate over 10 years Bush, who was sworn in about four months ago after previously leading the New Zealand police force , said he was particularly “surprised” to learn uniformed police officers handled reception counter and call-taking duties at stations across the state. If these officers were redeployed to the frontline, he said it would amount to 1.4 million additional personnel hours a year. Victoria police would now trial replacing sworn officers at counters with “alternate staff” as well as trialling new “investigation support units” of administration personnel, including former officers, to handle post-arrest paperwork. If successful, these changes would roll out statewide. Bush said there would also be a “focus on retention and return to work”, noting of roughly 22,000 police, protective service and public sector staff, about 700 were on workers’ compensation, mostly for mental health injuries. “Part of that’s because we’ve overburdened them with bureaucracy, duplicate systems – we’ve made their job tough,” he said. “We really want them back.” skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Breaking News Australia Get the most important news as it breaks Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Bush said it was “over 10 years” since police last had such a “significant restructure” but he said he was confident it would lead to a “much more effective service to reduce crime and harm and increase public trust and confidence”. Asked on Monday whether he supported mandatory sentencing , Bush said there must be “consequences” for serious offending. “It’s important for deterrence, to know what that looks like, and there should be consistency,” he said. “If you’re going to commit a serious crime, commit serious harm against other people, you need to know what’s going to happen to you.”",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/oct/13/victoria-police-restructure-overhaul-crime-trust,World,BBC,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cfc98a3cf67a3f768d730c48861786a8db043558/654_0_6507_5209/master/6507.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=84b7e2ada4d02719e792b3959eedb089",2025-10-13T05:11:01+00:00,f6d03754165a84df0b1b88b109553ad1376e9077
5dafee93da42,University of Sydney argues academic’s article not racist against Jewish people as ‘Zionism is a political concept’,,"The University of Sydney has argued that an article written by a staff member that criticises Zionism was not racist against Jewish people because “Zionism is, at its core, a political concept”. The argument was heard in the federal court on Monday as part of a racial discrimination case taken by academics against two of their colleagues and the university, in what is being considered a major test case for hate speech in Australia. The three academics, led by Joseph Toltz, and one student have argued their colleagues Dr Nick Riemer and Prof John Keane breached section 18C of the Racial Discrimination Act in a number of separate public comments which criticised Zionism and Israel. That section of the act makes it an offence to “offend, insult, humiliate or intimidate” another person or group on the basis of their race, colour, or national or ethnic origin. Sign up: AU Breaking News email In response, Keane and Riemer, who is also the vice-president of the National Tertiary Education Union (NTEU) at the University of Sydney, have argued that criticising Zionism or Israel is not racist hate speech. Toltz and the other applicants have also claimed that the University of Sydney is vicariously liable for an article by Riemer in the Overland literary journal, and a speech and post in which he said “there is no room for Zionism in our unions”. On Monday in a hearing before Justice Geoffrey Kennett, lawyers representing the university argued the vicarious liability case against it should be summarily dismissed. Riemer and Keane have not joined this application. The university’s barrister Robert Dick SC, who is not acting on behalf of Riemer and Keane, told the court the racial discrimination act is clear that it does not capture “criticism of political views”. “Zionism is at its core a political concept,” Dick told the court. “If you identify with Zionism you may be offended when you read these posts,” he said, referring to a post by Riemer about unions. “But if it’s not to do with your race, your colour or your ethnic origins, then you are excluded as a candidate for establishing a breach [of the racial discrimination act].” In the post, Riemer had said “there’s no room for racism, for settler colonialism, for apartheid in our unions, and there is no room for Zionism in our unions”. Toltz claimed that one of two imputations from this post was that: “Jewish people and Israeli people should be excluded from any participation in unions in Australia including in the National Tertiary Education Union.” He also argued that Riemer’s various posts contravened the act because “references to Zionists are, properly understood, to be a reference to (at least) a majority of Jewish people and Israeli people in Australia”. But Dick said the posts were not seeking to call for the exclusion of Jewish or Israeli people, and therefore should not be found in breach. Dick also argued that even if it is accepted that many Jewish and Israeli people identify with “Zionism and as Zionists”, not all do. He also raised that people who aren’t Jewish or Israeli can also identify with Zionism. Toltz argued the university is also vicariously liable for an article published by Riemer in Overland on 15 October 2023. Riemer wrote in the article: “Palestine solidarity is not just internationalism or anti-colonialism or antiracism or even humanitarianism; it is not just an expression of compassion, or altruism, or basic decency: it is a necessity for the defence of democratic prerogatives against authoritarianism and neo-fascism in Western nations.” “In cheering on the antidemocratic suppression of protest Zionists sometimes thought of as ‘liberal’ have let their masks slip. Their support for Israeli apartheid and permanent war against Palestinians can only mean opposition to democracy in their own countries.” skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Breaking News Australia Get the most important news as it breaks Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Dick disputed this, saying nowhere in the article does it say that Jewish or Israeli people have engaged in racism, settler colonialism or apartheid. He also told the court Zionism or Zionists cannot be considered a “direct synonym” for Jewish or Israeli people. Dick referred to a recent federal court ruling by Justice Angus Stewart against Muslim cleric Wissam Haddad. Haddad was found in breach of the racial discrimination act for “antisemitic” sermons, but Justice Stewart also ruled that criticism of Zionism or Israel was not antisemitic. The claims against Reimer extend to numerous posts, chants and speeches, beyond what the University of Sydney has been accused of being vicariously liable for. One of the posts Riemer made on the 12 November 2023 criticised the ABC for sacking Antoinette Lattouf. Keane has been accused of celebrating Hamas actions on 7 October after he published “5 green Hamas flags with Arabic writing visible on them” the day after on his X account.

90b8a80c42f5,UK MPs urged to investigate TikTok’s plans to cut 439 content moderator jobs,,"Trade unions and online safety experts have urged MPs to investigate TikTok’s plans to make hundreds of jobs for UK-based content moderators redundant. The video app company is planning 439 redundancies in its trust and safety team in London, leading to warnings that the jobs losses will have implications for online safety. The Trades Union Congress, Communication Workers Union and leading figures in online safety have signed an open letter to Chi Onwurah MP, the Labour chair of the science, innovation and technology committee, calling for an investigation into the proposals. The letter warns the cuts could expose children to harmful content, citing estimates from the UK’s data watchdog that up to 1.4 million TikTok users are under 13. TikTok has more than 30 million UK users. “These safety-critical workers are the frontline of protecting users and communities from deepfakes, toxicity and abuse,” the letter said. It also claims that TikTok is looking to replace the moderators with artificial intelligence-driven systems and with workers in countries such as Kenya and the Philippines. How TikTok harms boys and girls differently – video The signatories also accuse Chinese-owned TikTok of union-busting by announcing the job cuts eight days before workers were due to vote on union recognition with the CWU’s tech branch. “There is no proper business case for making these redundancies. TikTok’s revenues are booming – with a 40% increase for the UK and Europe alone,” the letter said. “Yet the company has decided to cut corners. We believe this decision is an act of union-busting – at the cost of workers’ rights, user safety and the integrity of online information.” The letter is also signed by Ian Russell, the father of Molly Russell, a British teenager who took her own life after viewing harmful content online, the Meta whistleblower Arturo Bejar and Sonia Livingstone, a professor of social psychology at the London School of Economics. It asks the committee to examine the implications of the redundancies for online safety and workers’ rights and what legislative steps can be taken to prevent offshoring of content moderation or replacing human moderators with AI. Asked to comment on the letter, Onwurah said the jobs cut plans indicated that TikTok’s commitment to content moderation was under review, which “given the clear role that the recommendation algorithms used by TikTok and other platforms play in exposing users to large volumes of harmful and misleading content is a matter of significant concern”. skip past newsletter promotion Our morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it matters Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

5080e55161a0,‘Lab to fab’: are promises of a graphene revolution finally coming true?,,"A fter graphene was first produced at the University of Manchester in 2004, it was hailed as a wonder material , stronger than steel but lighter than paper. But two decades on, not every UK graphene company has made the most of that potential. Some show promise but others are struggling. Extracted from graphite, commonly used in pencils, graphene is a latticed sheet of carbon one atom thick, and is highly effective at conducting heat and electricity. China is the world’s biggest producer, using it to try to get ahead in the global race to produce microchips and in sectors such as construction. In the UK, a graphene-enhanced, low-carbon concrete was laid at a Northumbrian Water site in July, developed by the Graphene Engineering Innovation Centre (GEIC) at the University of Manchester and Cemex UK. “The material when it came out of academia was hyped to death … but the challenge is going from lab to fab,” says Ben Jensen, the chief executive of 2D Photonics, a startup spun out from the University of Cambridge that makes graphene-based photonic technology for datacentres. Jensen also invented Vantablack coatings, made of carbon nanotubes – rolled-up sheets of graphene – and known as the world’s “blackest black” because it absorbs 99.96% of light, at the UK company Surrey NanoSystems that he founded in 2007. The material’s artistic rights were sold exclusively to the sculptor Anish Kapoor , and BMW used it on its X6 coupe to create the “blackest black car” six years ago. An untitled Vantablack work by Anish Kapoor on display in Venice in 2022. Photograph: David Levene/The Guardian “This is the challenge when you have new materials trying to displace an incumbent technology,” Jensen says. “The value proposition must be extremely good, but there also must be a way to manufacture the material and manufacture it at scale for the application … then you have to meet price expectations because there’s no point in delivering something that’s costing 10 times more than the incumbent.” Germany’s Bayer tried to produce carbon nanotube products in bulk but shut down its pilot factory more than a decade ago after the expected surge in demand failed to materialise. The material is now mainly used as a filler to strengthen plastic products. The company described the potential applications of nanotubes as “fragmented”. More promising are the graphene-based optical microchips developed by 2D Photonics’ subsidiary CamGraPhIC, which are based on research done at the University of Cambridge and Italy’s CNIT research institute. At the moment, silicon-photonics microchips convert electrical data into optical data to transmit it through fibre-optic cables, but the firm says its graphene chips deliver more data in the same period of time and at far lower cost. Single graphene crystals. Photograph: 2D Photonics They consume 80% less energy and can operate in a much wider range of temperatures, reducing the need for costly water- and energy-hungry cooling systems for AI datacentres. Sending data via silicon also causes delays. Jensen compares it to a 16-lane motorway that suddenly narrows to a single lane because of roadworks, forcing everything to slow down. Graphene photonics, he says, are like a motorway with hundreds of lanes. “What we’ve solved is the ability to grow consistent ultra high-performance graphene and to build it into a device,” he says. “And don’t forget, this is a material that’s one atom thick. It’s insanely difficult to do this.” Ben Jensen, the chief executive of 2D Photonics. Photograph: Ermanno Fissore CamGraPhIC was founded in 2018 by the Cambridge nanotechnology professor Andrea Ferrari, who also runs the Cambridge graphene centre, and Marco Romagnoli, who leads advanced photonics at CNIT in Pisa and is the startup’s chief scientific officer. Its parent, 2D Photonics, has just secured funding of £25m from backers including Italy’s sovereign wealth fund, Nato and Sony innovation funds, Bosch Ventures and the UK’s Frontier IP Group, and uses a former Pirelli photonics research site in Pisa. It plans to create a pilot manufacturing site in the Milan area to produce 200mm-wide wafers at scale, and is confident of obtaining the necessary funding of €317m (£276m) by the end of the year. skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Business Today Get set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morning Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Paragraf , a University of Cambridge spinout based in the nearby village of Somersham, has also fared well over the past decade with backing from the UK Treasury. It produces graphene-based electronic devices, including sensors for electric cars, and biosensors for the early detection of disease and other uses in healthcare and agriculture. It recently secured $55m (£41m) from investors including the United Arab Emirates sovereign wealth fund, which took a 12.8% stake in Paragraf. A more recent startup, Graphene Innovations Manchester, launched in 2021 by Vivek Koncherry, struck a deal with Saudi Arabia last December for the world’s first commercial production of graphene-enriched carbon fibre, used in construction for roofs and facades, as well as street light poles. It has started making it in Tabuk with a local partner, and says it is on track to produce 3,000 tonnes by 2026. The 2D Photonics cleanroom at its development facility in Pisa. Photograph: 2D Photonics Other businesses, however, have found the going tougher. One of the sector’s first companies was Applied Graphene Materials, founded by Prof Karl Coleman in 2010 and spun out from Durham University . It launched a number of products including an anti-corrosion primer and a protective bike-detailing spray, which made it on to the shelves in Halfords. But the loss-making enterprise was wound down in 2023 and Canada’s Universal Matter acquired its main business. Ron Mertens, the owner of the website Graphene-Info, says: “As is true in the wider materials industry, things take a very long time to reach the market. Many graphene producers and developers never managed to generate meaningful revenues or become profitable.” The Gloucestershire-based Versarien grew from a garage startup in 2010. Supported by Innovate UK, a government agency, it has developed graphene powders and other products for use in sensors, low-carbon concrete, paints, inks for electronics and textiles such as Umbro running gear and prototype stealth materials for the US military. The Aim-listed company expanded into Spain and South Korea but ran into financial difficulties and was forced to place several subsidiaries in administration or voluntary liquidation in July. Versarien has been seeking to sell its assets, including its patent portfolio, and only has enough cash to keep going until the end of October. Depending on the deal, it may undertake a solvent liquidation of the company or become a cash shell. An investment deal with a Chinese partner collapsed after the UK government intervened to block any collaboration on technology.

f9dbfaafc933,National Trust and TV wildlife expert team up on autumn nature campaign,,"There may be a bite in the wind and the nights are certainly drawing in but a conservation charity and a television wildlife champion have launched a campaign aimed at getting more people connecting with nature in the autumn and winter months. The National Trust is launching a “Wild Senses” campaign on the back of the new BBC series Hamza’s Hidden Wild Isles in which the wildlife expert and camera operator Hamza Yassin celebrates the UK’s seasons and encourages viewers to notice, appreciate and reconnect to wildlife everywhere. It comes as a poll commissioned by the National Trust suggests people feel disconnected with nature in the darker, chillier months. Though the vast majority said being out in nature boosted their wellbeing, only a third felt connected to nature across all seasons equally. Yassin told the Guardian that autumn was one of his favourite seasons and was full of the sights, sounds and smells of nature, from birds arriving to overwinter in the UK to the taste of foraged fungi. “For me, autumn is the time to use all your senses,” he said. “Let’s go for sight: the colours of the trees are amazing. There’s the sight and sound of what I call the change of the guard as the summer migrant birds head off to Africa and the redwings and pink-footed geese arrive. “If you know how, you can forage for fungi. And the red deer rut is happening at the moment. Get up, go to the middle of Richmond Park [in west London], sit yourself down, and just listen to those stags roaring. There is so much that people can listen to, feel, touch, sense, see. Autumn is probably the best month for it.” One of the central takeaways from Yassin’s show, which is co-produced by the trust and the Open University , is that nature is everywhere – in cities as well as the wilds. “For example, you have the fastest living creature, the peregrine falcon , living in our cities,” he said. “You’ve got one of the cleverest, which is the pigeon. You’ve got one of the most cunning, the urban fox. We’ve got badgers, hedgehogs, all sorts of gems. Sometimes in our cities it might seem like there isn’t any nature. But if you just take a little minute, you’ll be amazed at what you can find.” In the poll, carried out by YouGov, 90% of people said spending time in nature had a very positive or somewhat positive impact on their wellbeing. But only 34% said they felt connected to nature across all seasons equally. Just 13% said they felt most connected to nature in autumn, while for winter it was a mere 3%. skip past newsletter promotion The planet's most important stories.

8fea2cb754ff,Head of Frieze London art fair hopes for ‘Barbenheimer moment’ with Paris rival,,"The chief executive of Frieze London has dismissed the idea his fair is in a battle with Art Basel Paris, claiming the two events could create a “ Barbenheimer moment” for collectors this October – despite the art market being in a severe slump. Simon Fox told the Guardian that the fair, which opens on Wednesday, can benefit from having strong competition on its doorstep and replicate the mutual success of Barbie and Oppenheimer at the box office in 2023. He said: “It’s very convenient for collectors who can come to London, spend a weekend here and then go on to Paris . It makes for a Barbenheimer moment.” Since launching in 2003, Frieze London has become a key destination in the global art-fair circuit with Art Basel Paris opening in 2022 and growing each year. This year the Gerhard Richter show at the Fondation Louis Vuitton opens during Frieze, with one gallerist saying it felt as if Paris was parking its “tanks on the lawn”. Fox was keen to play down the idea of a rivalry, despite some galleries skipping London and heading directly to the French capital. Gallery assistants position Romans Parisiens by Vincent van Gogh at the art fair. Photograph: Henry Nicholls/AFP/Getty Images “London will have the blockbusters,” Fox said. “Some years it might be Paris’s turn, but they’re both extraordinary cities.” The Frieze chief executive did acknowledge “severe headwinds” hitting the market, such as the insecurity and instability caused by Donald Trump’s tariffs and the conflicts in Ukraine and Palestine. That challenging environment has hit some of the art market’s big names: this week Hauser & Wirth reported a 90% drop in profits . The global art market shrank by 12% in 2024 , according to the annual Art Basel and UBS report. Artnet’s mid-year report said a “storm” was hitting the market , with some galleries at risk of being “swept away” because the downturn was so severe. Sadie Coles, the gallerist who launched her first London space in 1997 and was part of the Young British Artists (YBA) movement of the 1990s having represented Sarah Lucas for decades, said despite the drop in sales, it was wrong to think London was in decline. Earlier in the year, Coles’ own finances were scrutinised in the Artnet report, which claimed her gallery’s profit margin had shrunk from 7.2% in 2023 to 0.7% in 2024 . “I know that my figures are going to be pored over,” she said. “I don’t really care because I know how solid we are financially. I know that I’m about to open a new gallery, and I know I have no debt .” Speaking about the negative coverage, she said: “It’s actually irritating to me because it’s this spiral of doom stuff and actually on the ground here in London, there’s a very positive story, if you look for it.” She points to the recent openings of two non-profit art spaces – Ibraaz and Yan Du Projects (YDP) – as reminders of London’s pull. Coles is also opening her newest space on Savile Row during Frieze and is showing new work by Arthur Jafa, Helen Marten and Lisa Brice across three London venues. Coles said that despite the negative headlines, London was “in a moment right now that is equivalent to the 90s in terms of the young galleries” when the YBAs such as Lucas, Damien Hirst and Tracey Emin emerged. She said: “Partly because of Brexit and the slump in property, young galleries can rent an empty shop in Shoreditch on a six-month or year lease and start showing their friends that they went to art school with.” Anselm Kiefer’s Tempelhof on display. Photograph: Tristan Fewings/Getty Images for Sothebys Freddie Powell of Ginny on Frederick, a four-year-old gallery that started in a tiny space based in a former sandwich shop in Smithfield Market and represents artists including Alex Margo Arden , said Frieze and Paris were both important for young galleries. “Any London gallery that’s based here needs to make sure they have some presence in Paris as well,” he said. “But the initial focus is going to be on Frieze.” Jonny Tanna, founder of Harlesden High Street gallery, which had a space in Fitzrovia before moving to Harlesden and then opening a second space in Mayfair, said the 22-year-old fair needed to diversify. He said Frieze might have to become more adaptable in order to bring in new London galleries that exist outside the capital’s traditional moneyed ecosystem. “They need to look outside the box,” he said. “I guess one of the rules is if a gallery is nomadic, it can’t participate. But it’d be ideal if they changed that rule because a lot of these younger galleries can’t get into Frieze.” Tanna used the example of Bolanle Contemporary , which is taking part in Tanna’s Minor Attractions fair that runs alongside Frieze, as the kind of gallery that is itinerant and therefore cannot get a spot at the main fair. “She’s a powerhouse, is connected in the institutional world and knows everybody, but sadly she can’t get in,” he said. Frieze has just been bought for a reported $200m (£160m) by the media executive Ari Emanuel via his newly formed company, Mari.

387889626fbc,UK charities say toxic immigration rhetoric leading to threats against staff,,"Charities have warned of growing racial abuse, intimidation and threats of violence towards their staff and beneficiaries amid increasingly toxic rhetoric around immigration and race by politicians and extremist activists. Voluntary organisations say they are being forced to introduce extensive security measures to protect staff and property – a trend described by one charity head as in danger of becoming the “new normal” – after being targeted. Refugee and asylum seeker charities, Muslim, Jewish and ethnic minority organisations, women’s groups, youth bodies, homelessness charities and even charity shops have reported being subject to violence, threats and abuse. Incidents include threats to rape and kill staff, verbal and physical abuse of beneficiaries on the street, attempted break-ins to charity-owned accommodation, and damage to offices and vandalism, including anti-migrant and racist graffiti. Charities were being “targeted because of what they stand for and who they support”, said Saskia Konynenburg, executive director at the National Council for Voluntary Organisations. The threat has become more explicit and targeted since the far-right Southport riots in 2024 and the spread of inflammatory political and social media rhetoric around immigrants and “small boats”, say charities. They add the abuse has become more extreme and uninhibited in the way it is expressed or enacted, both on and offline. A coalition of more than 150 charities including Age UK, Citizens Advice and the Muslim Council of Britain has written to the prime minister, Keir Starmer, urging him to challenge the “cynical” targeting of civil society organisations by far-right politicians and activists seeking to stoke division for political gain in local communities. Ali Harris, the chief executive of equality and human rights charity Equally Ours , which organised the letter, said: “The devastating antisemitic attack at Heaton Park Synagogue is a tragic reminder that it’s never been more important for us all to stand united when any of our communities are targeted. “We are taking this collective stand because the organisations in this coalition and the communities we serve are experiencing growing threats and aggression – in places of worship, offices, shops, on public transport and high streets. People with extreme views are increasingly violent in how they express or act on their hatred.” One charity chief executive told the Guardian increasingly mainstream political rhetoric on the political right denigrating immigrants and refugees, and stoking community divisions along ethnic lines had created a “permission structure” for racism which had emboldened far-right activists. Last month, a drugs and alcohol charity in east London that formerly shared its premises with a refugee support charity was daubed with a George Cross and far-right graffiti. Volunteers repainted the office front only for far-right activists to return and deface the building with the slogan “East London stands with Southport”, a reference to the far right riots in Southport in 2024. Some charities have taken drastic safeguarding action in response to the threats including installing safe rooms , fitting staff with phone trackers, hiring security guards, taking down charity signs outside offices, removing staff names from websites and redacting trustee names from publicly available Charity Commission filings. Others have temporarily closed offices on the advice of local police, stopped providing outreach services because of the potential danger to staff and beneficiaries, and drawn up emergency action plans in the event their premises are attacked. One refugee charity head said they currently spent “60% of the time managing safety issues related to far-right activism”. Another charity told the Guardian it was considering spending thousands of pounds on personal safety devices. One charity head described the tight focus on staff security as the “new normal”. The chief executive of a London charity working with asylum seekers, who like most of those the Guardian spoke to wished to remain anonymous for security reasons, said the threats had a chilling effect but staff were determined to continue: “We do the work we do because we care and the people we support have been through terrible things and deserve a bit of kindness.” The letter to the prime minister sent last week called on the government to provide “clear and consistent leadership” to defend the values of inclusion, equality and anti-racism and “take a stand against the division and hate” fuelled by politicians scapegoating communities for political gain. “We are witnessing the significant damage to people of all backgrounds caused by the far-right’s cynical spreading of division and hostility between communities, their undermining of the rule of law, and the weaponisation of violence against women and girls.” It adds: “We are experiencing increasing racism, xenophobia, Islamophobia and antisemitism on the streets and in workplaces, including abuse of charity staff and charity shop volunteers. All this alongside attacks by the media and threats of violence against lawyers and civil society groups working with migrant and other marginalised communities.” A government spokesperson said: “Racism is completely unacceptable and has no place in our society. This government has pride in our tolerant and diverse country, and we are dedicated to tackling inequality at its roots, including working closely with ethnic minority leaders to enact change. “We have a strong legal framework in place to deal with the perpetrators of racism and other forms of hate crime and expect those responsible for these abhorrent offences to be brought to justice.”",https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/oct/13/uk-charities-toxic-immigration-rhetoric-threats-staff,politics,BBC,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/05bda860a0b21a07d48aac4f49b0b3b3be6fc43d/500_0_5000_4000/master/5000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=727545cb1380a5b58dce4db5b4238134",2025-10-13T07:00:17+00:00,244b5873186b4d79ae1dd5d3ef2fa3e99c6bb209
67cd0a776a07,MPs highlight plight of Gaza students unable to come to UK with children,,"A cross-party group of more than 100 MPs has written to the government, highlighting the plight of Palestinian students unable to take up scholarships at UK universities because they have been barred from bringing their children. The British government has now evacuated from Gaza almost 60 scholars with fully funded university places and more are expected soon, but others have been forced to abandon their plans in order to remain with their families. Among them is 26-year-old Loay*, who has a place to study at the University of Oxford, but chose to remain in Gaza when told his family could not accompany him. “Postponing my evacuation was heartbreaking,” he said. “My wife, Hala, and our three-month-old daughter, Raseel, are my whole world. I couldn’t leave them behind in Gaza City, where life has become a daily nightmare. “I was offered a lifeline, but what kind of life would it be if I escaped while they remained trapped in this horror? I held on to hope that if I waited, we might be allowed to leave together.” Loay was due to study for an MSc in health service improvement and evaluation at St Hilda’s College, but now he spends his days trying to source formula to feed his baby daughter. “I didn’t want safety at the cost of leaving my family behind. Becoming a father has deepened my sense of purpose, not only to protect my own daughter, but to build a future where all children can live in peace. “My drive to learn, grow and return equipped to serve my community has only grown stronger. I want to continue my education not just for myself, but for them and for Gaza.” Fatin, a 31-year-old mother of two with a scholarship to study for an MA in international education and development at the University of Sussex, said: “When deferring my first evacuation I tried so hard to calm down by convincing myself that days pass and the next evacuation is so close. “However, even before recovering from the stress and pressure of the feeling that you’re closing your way out to life with your own trembling hands, I suddenly started to be attacked by thoughts of a second failure, a second heartbreak: what if I cannot leave with my boys yet again?” The letter to ministers has been signed by MPs and members of the House of Lords from all parties, including the former Conservative education secretary Kenneth Baker, the veteran Labour peer and former child refugee Alf Dubs, the former Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn and the Green MP and former party leader Carla Denyer. Abtisam Mohamed, the Labour MP for Sheffield Central, and coordinator of the letter to the government, said: “Britain has a proud record of supporting scholars from conflict zones, and I welcome the government’s action on evacuating scholarship students out of Gaza so far.” The ceasefire offered a significant chance for peace, she said, but did not remove the challenges for remaining students who were being asked to make the impossible decision to evacuate and pursue their education while leaving their young children behind. “We cannot allow bureaucratic hurdles to stand in the way of compassion, nor should we abandon students and their families, whose lives and futures hang in the balance,” she said. As part of a crackdown on immigration, most international students are not allowed to bring their dependants with them to the UK, but campaigners say these are not typical circumstances and exceptions should be made. Dr Nora Parr, a researcher at the University of Birmingham who is supporting the students in Gaza, said the UK had so far welcomed 58 students under its scholar evacuation initiative and just one child, of a couple who are both master’s students, after the then home secretary, Yvette Cooper, exercised her ministerial discretion. “Many of the remaining scholars are also mothers and fathers, who have been unable to leave without their families. Some of these scholars are not typically eligible to bring their children or spouses on a student visa,” Parr said. “These are not typical times. In order to continue their education, they will need ministerial discretion to be exercised to ensure they and their fully supported families are able to reach safety.” A government spokesperson said: “We are actively supporting students in Gaza. We have already facilitated the departure of a number of students and expect further students to arrive in the coming weeks. Bringing individuals out of Gaza is an extremely complex and delicate operation.” * Campaigners have asked for only first names to be used",https://www.theguardian.com/education/2025/oct/13/mps-highlight-plight-of-gaza-students-unable-to-come-to-uk-with-children,politics,BBC,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b0c176f0ae34c4327dc5ceacd97147aa6c6bcc1c/23_0_1200_960/master/1200.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=b6a451e720922fed3da8547f194cf78f",2025-10-13T07:00:14+00:00,5d2b3fd9d947dc87d22c9d15307dacd0a67cab84
7a8f3c1616cc,Most of Great Britain’s major rail operators are back in public hands – is it working?,,"*Estimate based on contract expiry and government plans to nationalise every three months. Operator route maps are approximate The majority of Great Britain’s major rail operators are now in public ownership, as the Labour government continues its efforts to make the railways “more reliable, affordable and accessible”. The nationalisation of Greater Anglia on 12 October represents the ninth major passenger service to be brought back into public ownership, leaving seven to go before the government’s deadline of completing every operator by 2027. The rollout, which is resulting in an operator being nationalised roughly every three months, is gradually bringing an end to a privatised system that critics argue has been overly fragmented and focused on profit, to the detriment of passenger experience. Several operators were already under public ownership by the time Labour were elected in 2024, having been nationalised by the Conservatives over financial woes and poor performance. Meanwhile, Transport for Wales and ScotRail were each nationalised by the Welsh and Scottish devolved governments, in 2021 and 2022 respectively. However, under the current transport secretary, Heidi Alexander, the Department for Transport (DfT) has accelerated the pace of nationalisation, bringing three operators on to the public books since May: South Western Railway, C2C and Greater Anglia. State of play, October 2025 So far nine of the 16 major rail operators in Britain are now in public ownership: Tap an operator to highlight routes, tap again to deselect The government has said the remaining seven will be nationalised by October 2027 : The operator that was nationalised most recently was Greater Anglia , which took place on 12 October 2025 . The next operator set to be nationalised is West Midlands Trains , which the government says will take place in February 2026 . The nationalisations come ahead of the establishment of a new state-controlled company called Great British Railways, expected next year, which will manage rail infrastructure and services. It has been described by the DfT as a “single directing mind” for “bringing track and train together, putting passengers and customers first, [and] rebuilding trust in the railway”. It will soon manage most of the publicly owned operators in Great Britain, combining them with Network Rail, which owns the tracks, signals and big stations. However, Great Britain’s trains will remain privately owned. Industry insiders have expressed cautious optimism about Labour’s plans, highlighting the potential for Great British Railways to achieve more coordination and, in turn, greater efficiency. However, experts have also warned that nationalisation alone may not be enough to fix all of Britain’s problems with rail, given ballooning costs. “Irrespective of the ownership changes, the government’s got a major headache with the fact that rail is gobbling up so much public subsidy, and that’s before you get to HS2,” said Stephen Glaister, the emeritus professor of transport and infrastructure at Imperial College London and a former chair of the Office of Rail and Road. “The government are making promises to make fares even cheaper and services even better, but both will cost more public money.” The data available on nationalised operators so far offers a mixed picture on performance. Several have experienced improving train punctuality and a reduction in cancellations but the performance of others has worsened over the past year. LNER has been one of the most improved – and in June the rail minister, Peter Hendy, described the operator as a “blueprint” for wider renationalisation efforts. Guardian graphic. Source: delay and cancellation data taken from the Office of Rail and Road. *Note: South Western Railway, C2C and Greater Anglia were nationalised by the Labour government in the latter half of the time period analysed here When will the next operators be nationalised? Labour committed to bringing rail into public ownership in the party’s 2024 election manifesto – claiming it had come up with a way to nationalise trains “without costing taxpayers a penny in compensation”. Instead of an “all-at-once” approach, nationalising every operator simultaneously and paying off shareholders, the government is running down the clock on existing rail contracts. The DfT is waiting for each operator’s core contract expiry date, which allows the government to take over without compensating the private companies. The final operator to expire in this way will be CrossCountry in October 2027 – and this is when the government says it will have completed rail nationalisation in Great Britain. Until then, the government has set a pace of nationalising one operator in each annual quarter. West Midlands Railway is due next, in February 2026. Labour’s current one-at-a-time approach builds off of the work of its predecessors in government. Several operators – including LNER, Northern and Southeastern – were brought into public ownership by the Conservatives from 2018 onwards. In those cases, nationalisation was taken as an emergency measure rather than a deliberate policy – in response to financial difficulties, in the case of LNER, or because of dismal performance, in the case of Northern. Additionally, ScotRail and Transport for Wales were brought into public ownership by their respective devolved governments, and their train operations are not expected to be merged into Great British Railways. Labour’s strategy for the remaining operators is driven by legal reality – which experts say could be helpful given how fragmented rail in Great Britain has become. “You can’t do it in one go,” said Marcus Mayers, the managing director of the Rail and Station Innovation Company. “If you try to merge 22 companies in one go – you don’t have the ability to build the system, to join it together that quickly. “So you build an operation which is capable of ingesting organisations, and is capable of ingesting organisations at the rate of one every three months. That makes sense.” Will nationalisation improve the railways? The prime minister, Keir Starmer, has previously said his government would not be nationalising rail out of ideology but because of what it could deliver for passengers. “We’ve tried privatisation for two or three decades and it’s a complete mess,” the Labour leader said in April 2024 . “Everybody who travels on the trains has been affected by the cancellations and delay.” Privatisation was undertaken by the Conservatives in the 1990s, after decades of falling ridership under the nationalised British Rail. From 1948 onwards the annual number of journeys on Britain’s rail network fell consistently, from a peak of more than 1 billion a year in 1950 to a low of 0.6 billion in 1982. After privatisation, rail journeys recovered significantly, reaching a new peak of 1.7 billion by 2017. Chart showing passenger journeys on Britain’s rail network between 1945 to 2025 “Privatisation sparked a railway renaissance,” said Patrick McLoughlin, the transport secretary under David Cameron, in a speech in 2013. However, the impact on other aspects of train travel has been more mixed. One of the original selling points of privatisation was that competition for franchises would bring better value for the taxpayer. While the industry remained subsidised overall, some major commuter franchises went on to pay a return. Yet in the past few years, after huge falls in passenger numbers during the coronavirus pandemic, the amount the government pays to operators in public subsidy has ballooned to record levels. “The government is still forking out £12bn on operational subsidy, plus HS2 is another £7bn, plus extracurricular investment projects on the existing railways,” Glaister said. “That’s a very great deal of money in the context of the public expenditure crisis.” Costs have risen for passengers, too. Rail fares have become less affordable since privatisation, rising faster than average earnings in the same period. Today it costs about £8.90 to take a 50km (31-mile) journey by rail, based on how much revenue rail operators collect for each kilometre travelled on their network. When adjusting for inflation, that same journey would have cost £7.54 in 1994. Chart showing how rail fares have increased relative to wages since privatisation in 1995 The rising cost of rail comes amid widespread dissatisfaction with the reliability of Great Britain’s trains. Last year was the worst year for cancellations nationally since 2015, according to statistics produced by the Office of Rail and Road . Labour has pledged to improve reliability and affordability with nationalisation, banking on a unified Great British Railways to end what critics see as an overly fragmented system. “It’s possible, because there’s efficiencies of integration of track and train, which might mean that problems get solved more quickly,” Mayers said. “You may be taking out the commercial imperative to drive reliability, but you’ve also got more collaboration about how to achieve it. So it’s a fine balance, and whether it will work or not is still open for debate.” Others are sceptical of how much more efficiency can be wrung out of the system. “Governments frequently say: ‘Oh, we’ll make the railways more efficient, we’ll buy lots of new equipment, we’ll employ less people to do the work,’” Glaister said. “But the industry has been trying to do that for years and years, and the regulators screw that down to the absolute bottom in their settlements. And I don’t think there’s a lot of, as it were, undiscovered efficiencies to go for.” A DfT spokesperson said: “Through public ownership and the creation of Great British Railways, the government is fundamentally reforming how our railways are run, putting passengers first. “Public ownership will deliver a railway that is more accountable, efficient, and reliable – resulting in greater opportunities for communities and significant growth. “It is not a silver bullet, and issues inherited from private sector ownership will take time to root out, but we expect public sector operators – and Great British Railways once it is established – to focus relentlessly on improving reliability, punctuality and other aspects of the service that matter most to passengers, and we will hold them to account for doing so.”",https://www.theguardian.com/business/ng-interactive/2025/oct/13/most-of-great-britains-major-rail-operators-are-back-in-public-hands-is-it-working,politics,BBC,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/91b462f9f4dd50ba732fe3733fdd2d6794f73cea/1_0_4998_4000/master/4998.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=5a7cadaf94ccae7ad9376aac210974fd",2025-10-13T06:00:14+00:00,f3f17a166e01c941fd375efa8cca6ad7dcb14d4c
db85f55d4bd1,All beliefs are welcome in London – we cannot allow extremists to divide us,,"F or the first time in three years, hate crime in England and Wales is on the rise. The latest statistics released by the Home Office, showing religiously motivated offences at a record level, are deeply disturbing. But for those who have witnessed some of the appalling scenes on our city’s streets in recent months, they will not be surprising. Over the past two years, Jewish people have faced a rising tide of antisemitism, and the heinous terrorist attack in Manchester on Yom Kippur was a terrible reminder of just how pervasive this poisonous form of hatred continues to be. Between January and June, the Community Security Trust reported more than 1,500 antisemitic incidents. A survey by the Institute for Jewish Policy Research found that 35% of Jewish people feel unsafe in the UK. A terrifying increase in anti-Muslim hatred has left many British Muslims feeling the same way. Two days after the horrific events at Heaton Park synagogue, a mosque was set alight in Peacehaven. A suspected arson with the intent to endanger life, it was the latest in a long line of violent assaults on Muslim places of worship. In July, one man was sentenced after videoing himself releasing wild rats next to a mosque in Sheffield. In the same week, another pleaded guilty to terrorism offences after planning to burn down a mosque in Greenock. The idea that attacks against our Jewish and Muslim communities are isolated incidents is ignorant at best. At worst, this thinking is deeply dangerous. The violence we have witnessed is the result of rapidly deepening divides in our society which, if left to fester and grow, could tear our way of life apart. For Londoners, this is profoundly distressing. Our diverse city must always be a place where people of all faiths and none can live side by side in the knowledge that they aren’t just safe to be who they are – they are celebrated for it. Today, though, extremists are attempting to exploit our fears to divide us for their own gain, and their ideas are being allowed to infect mainstream political debate. As a city and as a society, we must put a stop to this. The London I know isn’t a city where people feel scared go to their synagogue or mosque, or fear wearing a hijab or a kippah in public. My London – the London I’ll keep standing up for – is a city where Muslim, Jewish and Christian leaders come together to celebrate Iftar, and people walking home from Friday prayers wish their neighbours shalom Shabbat. A place where we come together to condemn violence against places of worship, knowing that any attack on our neighbour’s freedom of religion is also an attack on our own. The London I love is the one I saw on a cloudy morning last November. Across the capital, thousands of people came together to visit care homes, clean up parks and cook for those in need. Jewish, Muslim, and Christian, Hindu, Buddhist, and Sikh, they were all taking part in Mitzvah Day: the UK’s largest faith-led day of social action. Founded by a Jewish Londoner, Laura Marks, Mitzvah Day has become a staple of life for many communities in the capital. City Hall is no different. Preparing for the day by packing boxes full of fresh vegetables for vulnerable Londoners with my colleagues, I found myself reflecting on our reasons for being there. Grounded in Jewish tradition, Mitzvah Day asks us to do good deeds – or mitzvot – for our community. For Muslims like me, that feels very familiar; zakat, or giving to the needy, is one of the five pillars of our religion. In the call to love your neighbour, my Christian friends hear a similar chance to put their beliefs into practice through acts of charity. My Hindu and Sikh friends embody this in seva, or selfless service. skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Matters of Opinion Guardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and more Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But, drawing on our different traditions, we also found a common cause: building a better future for the community we are proud to share. In homeless shelters and food banks across the country, many others did the same. Together, we showed that our diversity is a strength to be celebrated, not a weakness to be hidden. That, when faced with darkness and despair, hope and unity will always prevail. I don’t see my faith as something that sets me apart from my fellow Londoners, because I believe our different beliefs can bring us closer. As some seek to score cheap political points by weaponising a series of appalling events to turn us against one another, we can find an antidote to hatred in the sense of purpose we share in our churches, mosques and synagogues, our mandirs, temples and gurdwaras. Sadly, some politicians and commentators seem unwilling to defend this common humanity, choosing instead to exacerbate tensions by appealing to our worst instincts. This is reckless and wrong, revealing callous disregard for the safety of the people they are supposed to serve.

38da2e782dca,AFP investigates Lidia Thorpe’s claim she would ‘burn down’ Parliament House,,"The Australian federal police has said it is investigating whether independent senator Lidia Thorpe’s claim to a pro-Palestinian rally in Melbourne that she would “burn down” Parliament House has breached legislation. Thorpe told the rally on Sunday: “We stand with you every day, and we will fight every day, and we will turn up every day, and if I have to burn down Parliament House to make a point … I am not there to make friends.” On Monday, she said she had not meant the words literally and condemned what she called the “mock outrage” that followed them. “My rally remarks were clearly a figure of speech – a metaphor for the pain in our communities and the urgent need to end genocide in Palestine and everywhere,” she said. “They were obviously not a literal threat. This mock outrage is ridiculous. While people are dying and starving in Gaza , politicians and media are once again clutching their pearls and chasing a scandal instead of focusing on what really matters. This is just another political game designed to distract from the real issues. Sign up: AU Breaking News email “I have always rejected violence. Any suggestion otherwise misrepresents my long‑standing commitment to pursuing justice and self-determination for First Peoples and all oppressed peoples through peaceful, democratic means.” A spokesperson for the AFP said its National Security Investigations team in Victoria began investigating the comments “almost immediately”. “This will be done methodically …. Noting the public commentary and concern, the AFP is seeking to reassure the community that this issue is being appropriately considered and undertaken in a timely manner,” the spokesperson said in a statement. The spokesperson declined to provide further details, and said it is “not the usual practice of the AFP to provide a running commentary”. Thorpe’s comments were condemned by politicians on Monday, who called the remarks “disgraceful” and “irresponsible”. Government frontbencher Tanya Plibersek said she wouldn’t give Thorpe more attention, and that any parliamentary action against the Victorian senator would be considered “down the track”. “What Lidia Thorpe has said is absolutely irresponsible. We just don’t want to give it extra airtime,” Plibersek said. The home affairs minister, Tony Burke, told ABC radio now was the time for “turning the temperature down”. “The concept of wanting to inflame, push the temperature up, is not what anyone should be doing, least of all a member of parliament. I’m not going to respond to that by increasing the heat in the opposite direction,” he said. Liberal senator Maria Kovacic told Sky News that Thorpe “should consider whether she is right to be sitting in our parliament”. “They’re disgraceful comments.

His latest salvo reignited the war of words with the Chinese as he threatened further 100% tariffs given their current position on rare earth metals and was a stark reminder of the ongoing fractious relationship between the world’s two largest economies. Large technology shares found themselves at the eye of the storm given a large exposure to and relationship with the Chinese as customers, sending the Nasdaq some 3.6% lower, led by declines of nearly 5% for Nvidia and almost 8% for Advanced Micro Devices [on Friday]. The president’s propensity to shoot from the hip unsettles the investment environment, even though some are already speculating that the TACO trade is alive and well . His subsequent comments on social media over the weekend were decidedly more conciliatory, and at this very early stage, Dow futures are pointing to a brisk recovery which would lessen the blow of Friday’s bruising session. European stocks open modestly higher; TACO trade 'alive and well' Stock markets in the UK and the rest of Europe have shrugged off the latest trade sabre-rattling from the US and China and opened modestly higher. The UK’s FTSE 100 index rose by 15 points, or nearly 0.2%, to 9,442, while markets in France, Spain, Germany are all up by around 0.5%. Investors are hoping that Washington will temper its latest escalation of the trade war with Beijing after Friday’s sell-off on Wall Street. US stock futures are pointing to a rally on Wall Street later. Donald Trump indicated yesterday that the door was open to a trade deal with a more conciliatory post on social media. Mining shares are leading the gains in London, with Fresnillo up by 4.8%, Endeavour Mining 4% ahead, and Antofagasta 1.2% ahead. Sterling, which tends to benefit from risk appetite, much like the Australian dollar, stocks or crypto currencies, was up 0.24% at $1.3365, making it one of the better performing major currencies against the US dollar. The dollar has slipped 0.1% against a basket of major currencies. Tim Kelleher , head of institutional foreign exchange sales at Commonwealth Bank in Auckland, told Reuters: Certainly, it’s pretty nervous out there. If you look at the US and China stuff, it looks like Trump has done a bit of a TACO again and softened his tone. He was referring to the trading adage that “Trump always chickens out”. Share Updated at 03.21 EDT Lloyds puts aside extra £800m for car finance scandal Lloyds Banking Group has put aside an extra £800m to deal with possible compensation claims over the motor finance scandal, taking its total provision to almost £2bn. The bank, which is one of the most exposed to an ongoing scandal in which drivers were overcharged for loans as a result of commission paid to car dealers, had previously set aside £1.15bn to deal with potential costs. However, it said an additional charge of £800m reflects an increased likelihood of more historical cases, particularly those affected by “discretionary commission arrangements”, being eligible for compensation. The new estimate comes after the Financial Conduct Authority published a 360-page consultation paper for its redress scheme. The regulator said last week that the mis-selling scandal would cost banks £11bn overall, though it could rise to £12.4bn if all victims apply and secure payouts as part of the scheme. Lloyds said the ultimate outcome may “evolve in response to representations made by various parties as well as further legal proceedings and complaints or any other broader implications fo the Supreme Court judgement”. Share Updated at 02.54 EDT Introduction: Asian stocks tumble on fresh US-China trade spat; Chinese exports top forecasts Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of business, the financial markets and the world economy. Stock markets in Asia have tumbled, after the latest US tariff threat on China prompted Beijing to warn Washington of retaliation. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng lost 2.1%, the Taiwanese market fell by 1.4% and the Thai exchange declined by 2%. In mainland China , the Shenzhen exchange fell by 1% and the Shanghai market slipped 0.2%. Japan’s Nikkei is closed. Beijing has told the US it will retaliate if Donald Trump fails to back down on his threat to impose 100% tariffs on Chinese imports as investors brace for another bout of trade war turmoil. China’s commerce ministry blamed Washington for raising trade tensions between the two countries after the US president announced on Friday that he would impose the additional tariffs on China’s exports to the US , along with new controls on critical software, by 1 November in a tit-for-tat, after China said it would restrict rare earth exports. However, Trump and senior US administration officials opened a door to a China trade deal on Sunday when market futures showed another US stock market drop, but they have since bounced back and are now pointing to a higher open on Wall Street later. Trump wrote on Truth Social: Don’t worry about China, it will all be fine! Highly respected President Xi just had a bad moment. He doesn’t want Depression for his country, and neither do I. The U.S.A. wants to help China, not hurt it!!! Despite the trade tensions, Chinese exports bounced back in September , topping forecasts after the world’s second-largest economy diversified its markets. China’s exports rose by 8.3% year on year last month, according to customs data. This was the fastest growth since March, and beat a 6% increase forecast by economists polled by Reuters. It comes after a 4.4% increase in August. Lynn Song , chief economist Greater China at ING, said: China’s exports continued to beat forecasts in September, but the bigger surprise was the surge of imports to hit a 17-month high. This resilience shows that China has strengthened trade with the rest of the world amid US protectionism. Chinese imports growth jumped to 7.4%, from 1.3% in August. This came as a surprise given the recent signs of relatively weak domestic demand. Julian Evans-Pritchard , economist at Capital Economics , said: While China’s economy has proven more resilient in the face of US tariffs than many had feared, there is still significant potential downside from a deeper rift with the US.

89be45e95a3b,Five million Qantas customers have had personal information leaked on the dark web. Here’s what you need to know,,"A hacker collective called Scattered Lapsus$ Hunters released the stolen records from more than 40 companies worldwide , including Qantas, on Saturday after their deadline for ransom payment passed. Here’s what you need to know about the data breach. What Qantas data has been leaked? Customer names, email addresses, and frequent flyer numbers for over 5 million customers were among the data leaked, Qantas said. The amount of individual data obtained varies between customers. Some customer records included home and business addresses, dates of birth, phone numbers, gender and even meal preferences. Sign up: AU Breaking News email Federal politicians were among those whose home addresses were leaked, the national cyber security coordinator has said. Qantas said it had emailed affected customers to advise which types of their information was impacted. No identity documents, credit cards or financial details were leaked, nor were any passwords or pin numbers, and hackers have not gained access to Frequent Flyer accounts, the airline said. Will scammers access the Qantas data leak? Qantas has sought and received an injunction from the NSW Supreme Court, which prevents the stolen data being accessed, viewed, released, used, transmitted or published. It is illegal to access the the stolen data, according to Tony Burke, the minister for cybersecurity. “No-one should go looking for it on the dark web … even if you’re looking for your own material,” he told ABC News Breakfast. However, the government expects scammers will illegally use the data and carry out an increased number of scams to extract information from customers. Reports of scammers impersonating Qantas are already on the rise, the airline said. What should customers do? Customers should hang up on cold calls from people claiming to represent legitimate businesses, with the Australian government encouraging people to contact the business themselves. Cold callers could use the personal information to trick people into believing they are representatives of real businesses, the government warned. “If you’re getting a call you’re not expecting, hang up, call back through the official line,” Burke said. Dr Marthie Grobler, CSIRO’s Data61 principal research scientist, warned frequent flyer details could be used to make fake flight rescheduling or fraudulent reward redemption offers more believable. Qantas has advised customers who are contacted by people claiming to represent the airline to be cautious, follow Burke’s advice and ensure emails end in the official address -qantas.com or qantas.com.au – not imitations such as qantas.net or qantas.biz. The national privacy regulator recommends Australians change their email account passwords and enable two-step authentication. Qantas has offered a 24/7 support hotline and specialist identity protection advice for affected customers. Will affected customers be compensated? Qantas has not offered to compensate affected customers. Burke said he had not been focused on the issue of compensation and was more focused on whether Qantas had breached its obligations, which could incur fines. A leading class action law firm, Maurice Blackburn, has flagged it may seek compensation on behalf of affected customers, after lodging a representative complaint over the data breach in July. Data breaches at other Australian companies such as Optus and Medibank have prompted class action claims in recent years. How did the Qantas data leak occur? The hackers did not get the data by scamming individual customers but instead targeting a Qantas call centre and gaining access to the customers servicing platform in June, the airline said. Other companies targeted by recent attacks include Google, Toyota , Disney, McDonald’s, Puma, Cartier, Adidas, Qantas, Air France-KLM, Chanel and Ikea. Google analysis suggested the hackers called companies and pretended to be IT support staff, convincing legitimate staff to give them access to their Salesforce software platform, which stored customer data. Salesforce said the hackers had not broken into the platform through any software vulnerabilities and there was no sign the platform was compromised.",https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/oct/13/qantas-hack-leak-customer-data-dark-web-what-you-need-to-know,Business,BBC,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/da0f4867b6ba554670a1dcb1ba3f0c898ab5658f/479_0_4375_3500/master/4375.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=79d1491474fe5ace0e47fa25708f3f20",2025-10-13T04:16:57+00:00,f44b1d845513066df6dfcb4211be2bdb2af27b82
c8db72d5ab0d,Trump officials reportedly consider selling student loan debt to private investors,,"Officials in the Trump administration are reportedly weighing the possibility of selling portions of the federal government’s $1.6tn student loan portfolio to private investors, which experts say could carry risks for both taxpayers and borrowers – potentially reshaping the student loan landscape in unpredictable ways. Senior officials at the education and treasury departments have been engaged in internal conversations about offloading select, high-performing segments of the government’s student debt holdings, according to a Politico report this week. These loans are part of the larger portfolio owed by roughly 45 million borrowers nationwide. Administration officials have also reportedly reached out to figures in the financial industry, including potential buyers, to discuss the idea. The deliberations, which began earlier this year, initially included “department of government efficiency” (Doge) officials stationed at the education department but are now being guided primarily by senior political appointees. It’s unclear how far the administration will take the idea, or which parts of the $1.6tn portfolio could be put on the market. Daniel Zibel, vice-president and chief counsel at the National Student Legal Defense Network, described the proposed loan sale as a “complex and unprecedented” idea, essentially the reverse of the 2008 financial crisis, when the government bought privately held loans to stabilize the market. “The system for student debt is incredibly complicated, and for the administration to do this in a way that lives up to the protections that exist in the law for student loan borrowers makes it even more complicated,” Zibel said. Selling them off now, he said, would shift repayment and management responsibilities to private entities, raising questions about enforcement, oversight, and the continuity of borrower protections. It could also eliminate the government’s power to cancel the loan. “If you’re talking about unilateral cancellation, like what president Biden had been talking about, the department would certainly lose all authority to tell a private company that they had to cancel a debt,” he said. The sale proposal aligns with the administration’s broader goal of reducing the federal footprint in the student loan system and encouraging more private-sector involvement. It could also explain why the Trump administration was so eager to roll back the loan forgiveness offered by the Biden administration. “Now we know why President Trump and Secretary [Linda] McMahon are hell bent on squeezing every last dollar out of families with student debt,” Mike Pierce, executive director of Protect Borrowers, said in a statement . “Once again, we see that across the Trump Administration, when Wall Street’s demands run against the financial needs of working people, the banks get what they want.” Michele Zampini, associate vice-president of federal policy at the Institute for College Access and Success, says the plan is likely linked to the Trump administration’s broader ideological aim of shrinking or dismantling the education department. “This is all part of that same conversation, because the department manages this huge, billion plus dollar loan portfolio,” Zampini said. “You can’t really wind down the department while still having responsibility for this type of loan portfolio. It’s driven by their desire to wind down the department more broadly. This is the roadblock in their way in many senses.” Any attempt to sell off federal student loans would raise major legal and logistical questions. Borrowers could face uncertainty about whether current consumer protections, often more favorable than those offered in the private market, would remain intact. It’s also unclear whether the government would continue to guarantee the loans. Zampini adds that the move would put borrower protections at particular risk “because there’s really no precedent for this”. “There is no indication that there is, first of all, interest from the private market. And if there is interest, their interest would likely be to squeeze as much profit from the repayment as they could,” she said. “And so the interest of a private purchaser and a private investor would very likely not be to provide borrowers with any type of generous benefits or relief programs.” This is not the first time the idea has surfaced. During Trump’s first term, the education department hired consulting firms to evaluate the student loan portfolio and estimate its potential sale value. That analysis revealed the loans were worth substantially less than government accountants had assumed, and the plan was shelved as the Covid-19 pandemic upended the economy. Now, with Trump back in office, the administration appears to be reviving the concept as part of a broader rethink of the student loan system. Officials are reportedly exploring whether to transfer management of the loan portfolio, or segments of it, from the education department to the treasury department, an idea seemingly consistent with Trump’s stated desire to close the education department altogether. “I don’t think this is driven by an interest in helping borrowers,” Zampini said. “Certainly, I don’t think it’s driven by an interest in improving the program. And I also don’t think it’s driven by an actual interest in saving taxpayers money. I think it’s driven mostly by a political interest.” The potential sale is only one part of a sweeping effort to overhaul the student loan system. The administration has already rolled back nearly all Biden-era policies that offered loan forgiveness or expanded repayment options. It has also resumed collecting defaulted loans for the first time since March 2020, when the pandemic prompted a nationwide pause. Still, it’s not completely clear how feasible these plans are under the current legal system. “The law does specifically allow the secretary of education to work with the treasury department to sell loans,” Zibel said. “But it very clearly says that the secretary has to determine that it is in the best interest of the United States to do so, but also that there will not result in any cost to the federal government.” The concerns are not just that current borrowers might be at risk of losing their protections, but that a student loan market controlled by private entities would increase the barriers to attend college. “The federal student loan program is unique because the loans are not originated with the goal of making a profit on them,” Zampini said. “They are essentially an access tool to enable people to go to college who wouldn’t necessarily be able to access that same credit in the private market. “All of those factors make them a lot less likely to generate a return for an investor. And so it’s hard to see how someone looking to make a return on these loans, on this portfolio, would do anything but increase as much as they can the amount of payment and decrease the relief programs and the flexibilities that the federal government offers.” Quick Guide Contact us about this story Show The best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.

927760f1af23,Widow of man conned out of pension savings to lose half the compensation to tax,,"The family of a deceased man, who was conned out of his retirement savings after investing in the Norton Motorcycles pension scam, is to lose almost half the subsequent compensation award because of a little-known tax rule. A long-running battle to win an award from the Fraud Compensation Fund (FCF) meant that Robert Dewar’s pension was not reimbursed until 2024, five years after his death at the age of 64. Dewar’s widow, Susan, had been expecting to inherit his pension tax free, as is typically the case when a spouse dies before the age of 75 . However, an obscure clause in HM Revenue and Customs rules means the transfer of the £114,000 owed will be taxed because it was made more than two years after death – leaving her facing a bill of about £50,000. The Dewars’ daughter, Sally Holmes, said: “Once Dad had moved his pension, to what was classified at the time as a legitimate scheme, there was nothing we could do about what happened. The only way we could get any recourse was via the Fraud Compensation Fund, which had to take a number of years and so guaranteed the tax charge. It was inevitable because of the way the system has been set up.” The news of the probable tax bill is another blow for a family that became one of the most vocal campaigners during a long struggle to win compensation for victims. The scandal began when more than 200 people fell victim to a “pensions liberation fraud” during 2012 and 2013 , when they were tricked into allowing about £11.5m to be transferred out of their existing retirement plans. Most of those funds were then transferred into three Norton pension schemes of which the company’s former owner Stuart Garner was a trustee. The funds subsequently vanished after being invested directly into the heritage motoring brand, which dates back to the 19th century and has boasted high-profile devotees including the revolutionary Ernesto “Che” Guevara and the actor Keanu Reeves . In 2022, Garner pleaded guilty to illegally investing millions of pounds of people’s retirement savings into his own businesses. He received an eight-month prison sentence , suspended for two years. Garner has always insisted he was also a victim of the initial liberation fraud. The conviction represented a huge fall from grace for the entrepreneur, who had used Norton’s brand to secure himself a cameo role in the 2015 Bond film Spectre and travelled with a government trade mission to China on Theresa May’s jet when she was prime minister. skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Business Today Get set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morning Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

ab17c6f077c5,RFU could use ‘anti-pee paint’ to placate Twickenham locals in push for new licence,,"The Rugby Football Union has proposed using “anti-pee paint” that would leave public offenders “covered in their own urine”, to ease residents’ fears over plans to increase the number of music concerts staged at Twickenham’s Allianz Stadium. The RFU is seeking permission from Richmond council to stage up to 15 concerts a year, but the Guardian can reveal that it encountered another setback last week when it was determined that a limit of three concerts – and only one not on a Saturday – would remain as part of its new licence. The union has also encountered strong resistance from residents, many of whom are concerned with antisocial behaviour at England matches and late-night events. The decision to maintain the licensing limit has been described as “a significant victory for those who believe the RFU’s aspirations to [be] unreasonable and unsustainable”. The RFU has lamented how venues such as Wembley and the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium are able to generate significant revenue because of looser restrictions on non-sporting events, all the more so because the union wants to raise additional funds to pay for its planned £660m overhaul of Twickenham. The chief executive, Bill Sweeney, has suggested previously that the RFU could leave Twickenham and move to either Milton Keynes or Birmingham if it is not allowed to stage more concerts. At a council meeting last week to discuss the RFU’s application for a new licence, it emerged that 192 representations against the plans had been made as well as 13 in favour. Minutes of the meeting describe a complaint that “there are regularly drunken adults urinating on properties. There is also shouting, swearing and sometimes fighting in the streets”. One representation read: “The pavements and roads are unhygienic, and children are having to walk and scoot through dried urine and excrement,” while another provided evidence showing “urination and indecent exposure” on the individual’s property. In accompanying documents to the RFU’s submission for a new licence, the union sought to address recurring themes of residents’ concerns and how it deals with them. As well as portaloos in “known hotspots” and the presence of police officers who can issue fixed-penalty notices, the union states: “We have also recently been made aware of something called ‘anti‑pee paint’ (which has been used in, for example, Yorkshire and the London Borough of Camden). In short, if you relieve yourself against a wall, you will be covered in your own urine. It also prevents the odours associated by protecting the bricks. It is not a solution in itself, but we will always continue to try to find ways to prevent this behaviour where we can.” The RFU’s application to host more concerts is running in two parallel parts: licensing and planning. The previous licence dictated that the union could hold only three non‑sporting events per year and only one could be held on a day that is not a Saturday. The union’s application for a new licence left residents opposed to the plans amid fears it would give the RFU “carte blanche”. Residents also took issue with the RFU’s application to stage up to 36 smaller events, such as weddings, until 1.30am. In supporting documents, however, the RFU said it was not seeking to increase the number of concerts through its licensing application, insisting that it was a planning matter and it would be doing so via that avenue. Existing planning legislation states that the union can host three concerts a year but does not specify on which days of the week. The union was hoping to remove that stipulation from its new licence but Richmond council determined in its decision this past week that it would remain. Sweeney has previously expressed frustration at how “we could have had Beyoncé but she wanted three nights and we are only allowed two nights consecutively”. The restriction over which days of the week concerts can be performed at Twickenham was added in 2018 in the aftermath of an Eminem gig. As a result, the RFU received 93 complaints across 2018 and acknowledged “that it did present its own challenges, particularly around the issue of street cleaning/litter”. Beyoncé could have played at Twickenham in 2025 were it not for licence restrictions. Photograph: Samir Hussein/Getty Images The fact that Richmond council decided to explicitly state the limit of three concerts, and only one not on a Saturday, would be a part of the new licence – rather than leave it to the planning process – can therefore be considered a setback to the RFU. The union was successful in its application for smaller events and can still press ahead with its planning application, which is considered by insiders to be more significant than the licensing application. If the planning application for more concerts is successful, it is understood the RFU would then have to seek an amendment to the new licence it was granted last week. As reported by the Guardian last week, the union’s planning application encountered a delay this summer when Richmond council determined that an environmental statement was required due to fears over transport links. A report reads: “Given the uncertainty regarding the ability of the rail industry to cater for the predicted increase in passengers, there [are] significant concerns about the additional demand placed on the transport and highway network by event-goers and whether this demand can be satisfactorily managed.

a1632af22a2f,"Fossicking for a fortune: the price of gold is sky-high, and prospectors in Victoria hope to cash in",,"It’s a Friday morning at the Gold Centre in Maryborough, and the shop feels more like a social club than a place of commerce. A group who have signed up for a prospecting tour greet each other on the verandah, staff chat with customers seeking advice on various detection devices, and several others have just turned up for a yarn. All are drawn by a special kind of sickness: gold fever. Maryborough is located at the centre of Victoria’s Golden Triangle – an area encompassing Ballarat, Bendigo and Wedderburn, which produced some of the world’s largest alluvial nuggets during the gold rush of the 1850s. Lachy Green takes budding prospectors out to a test pad, just north of Maryborough It is still one of the most popular destinations in the world for prospectors, including Alaskan couple Keith and Marilyn Fye, who were in the midst of a gold-themed holiday. “From Sydney, we came down through Albury, then stayed in Yackandandah to see the Eldorado dredge, and we’ll visit Sovereign Hill in Ballarat,” says Marilyn. Sign up to receive Guardian Australia’s fortnightly Rural Network email newsletter “I feel a little more in touch with the meaning of it coming over here. I mean, gold has a value no matter what part of the planet you’re in, and there’s also a global community around it.” Since January, the spot price of gold has risen by 45% to a record high of A$5,900 an ounce, its steepest increase since the Iranian revolution caused a 126% spike in 1979. About five ounces (worth A$30,000) of prospected gold pictured at the Gold Centre in Maryborough Analysts predict it may go higher still but, according to the Gold Centre’s owner, Andrew Gladdis, there’s no sign of a fresh gold rush just yet. “People are definitely putting more effort into finding gold now, and they’re selling rather than keeping, because of the price, but I would say there were more getting into prospecting during Covid,” he says. Perhaps this is because the most valuable tool you need to find gold is time. This becomes apparent when tour guide Lachy Green takes his budding prospectors out to a test pad, just north of Maryborough. “To give you a rough idea, in eight hours of detecting with a coil of this size, you’re probably going to cover just over a tennis court of ground in a day,” Green tells his amateur gold diggers. Each wields a gold detector coil – the round disc at the end of the detector shaft that sends out an electromagnetic field to find metal objects. Gold detectors – worth anywhere between $1,500 and $10,800 – generally operate at a higher frequency than regular metal detector coils. Before you even start scouring your chosen patch, he explains, you need to set up the machine to minimise detection of “false targets”. First, you need to tune out as much electromagnetic interference as possible. If set to a “noisy” frequency, a detector can “woo woo” at power lines, radio signals or even a lightning strike in the next shire. Then there’s a ground balance, which is especially important in central Victoria, where there are high levels of mineralisation. “Basically, the machine should have a nice, flat hum,” says Green. “Some run a bit more upset than others, but you’re sort of dumbing it down to ignore that mineralisation.” skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to The Rural Network Subscribe to Calla Wahlquist's fortnightly update on Australian rural and regional affairs Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

At 1,008 ounces (28.5kg), this was the biggest single find in the Forest Creek/Mount Alexander diggings, considered the richest shallow alluvial goldfield the world has ever seen. ‘Victoria was built on gold’ … Jason Cornish at the unveiling of the Heron nugget monument The event is part of an effort by the Prospectors and Miners Association of Victoria to publicise the role gold played in Australia’s colonial history. “Victoria was built on gold,” the association’s president, Jason Cornish, says. “Melbourne was the richest city in the world at one stage, and towns up this way – like Castlemaine and Chewton – they wouldn’t even exist today without the goldfields. The association is vehemently opposed to a Victorian government proposal to increase the cost of miner’s right permits, which allow prospectors to keep what they find. There are almost 100,000 current miner’s rights in Victoria. The permit costs $28.60 and lasts for 10 years, but the Victorian government wishes to raise that to $93.10. Whatever the initial outlay, gold’s value is in its scarcity, something Maryborough resident Robyn Calhoun is only too aware of after six months of prospecting. “I’d love to trip over a nugget, but I’ve only found a metal button so far,” she says. “But it’s good exercise, and I love being out in the bush.” Stuart Walmsley is a photojournalist based in Castlemaine, Victoria",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/oct/12/prospecting-for-gold-australia-fossicking-fortune-victoria-goldfields,Business,BBC,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/900bb8441ee2a685140d622477cf0edb70560129/568_0_4258_3407/master/4258.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=c0571f1640a525c452b84606388e152c",2025-10-11T19:00:32+00:00,5d6edb55f18de114155e4c2afde1a02b81f77946
0fa7a588303e,BA stalls over paying out £220 flight compensation,,"I booked a Tui river cruise package in Switzerland with flights provided by British Airways . On the day we were to return home, we discovered our flight had been cancelled. There were about 40 people affected. BA eventually booked us on to a flight leaving 36 hours later, but has refused to pay us the £220 compensation each due under EC regulations. It says adverse weather was to blame and is exempted from compensation rules. I requested a formal confirmation of the cancellation to submit to my travel insurer and, on that form, BA claims “operational reasons ” were the cause. Unlike adverse weather, this is not covered by the insurance policy. AC, Alfreton, Derbyshire This is outrageous behaviour from a company that once considered itself “the world’s favourite airline”. You can’t get compensation from BA because, it says, bad weather grounded the flight, and you can’t get compensation from the insurer because the airline claims it was an operational issue. The difference is critical. Airlines are obliged to pay set sums of compensation for delayed or cancelled flights under regulation EC 261/2004 . They can only get out of it if the disruption was caused by “extraordinary circumstances”. The regulation is vague on what these circumstances might be, but years of court rulings have honed the list down. Undefined “operational issues” would not be considered an excuse to avoid a payout; weather sometimes is, but only if it is exceptional and unexpected. So which was the cause? Both, says BA, hedging its bets. It claims bad weather that had disrupted previous flights had displaced crew, and that had had a knock-on effect on your journey. It ignored my questions about the whens, wheres and hows but that’s immaterial. “Knock-on” effects of bad weather are not an excuse to withhold compensation, according to the law firm Bott & Co . BA insisted it couldn’t comment further because, by then, your case was in the hands of its dispute resolution service, CEDR. This sounded to me like stalling tactics. I pointed this out and suddenly it stumped up. Since the money had to be prised out of it, I fear the other affected passengers may still be empty-handed.

5dcf25765747,New rules have been proposed for your super. Here’s what you need to know,,"The Albanese government has dramatically rewritten its major tax policy, caving in to criticism on its controversial superannuation tax plan by raising thresholds and slashing the amount of money it will rake in. After a long period of sustained attack from politicians and lobby groups, the government has conceded defeat on all major criticisms, with the treasurer, Jim Chalmers , saying the policy rewrites would “better target superannuation concessions”. Chalmers also unveiled a new sweetener, a new tax offset for low-income earners to boost their super earnings. What has changed with superannuation? In the original plan outlined in February 2023, the Labor government proposed to add another 15% in tax to superannuation balances over $3m, taking that total concessional tax rate to 30%. The balance was not intended to be indexed, a major criticism from opponents. Under the changes outlined by Chalmers on Monday, the government will index the balance to the CPI measure of inflation. It will also add a new threshold, taxing balances of between $3m and $10m at 30%, and balances over $10m at 40%. The changes will also be delayed by a year from their intended start date, now coming into force in July 2026. Are unrealised gains still being taxed? Another major criticism was that the original proposal would have calculated tax on unrealised gains – that is, earnings made “on paper” inside an account, but which had not yet been cashed out. Sign up: AU Breaking News email Critics were concerned that assets held inside super accounts, including homes or farms not intended to be sold for some time, could increase in value and leave their owners liable for a tax bill; the shadow treasurer, Ted O’Brien, called this “theoretical profits”. Treasury said the “revised methodology” will now apply to realised earnings, based on taxable income. “These are sensible changes which take more than two years of feedback into account,” Chalmers said. “We have worked through the issues and we found another way to deliver on the same objectives.” Do lower income Australians experience any of the benefit? While the focus was on the upper end, Chalmers also announced an unexpected change to super rules for the lowest earners. From 2027, the low income superannuation tax offset (Listo) will be increased from $500 to $810, and its eligibility threshold raised from $37,000 to $45,000. This increased offset could mean an extra $15,000 in the super balances of lower paid earners by the end of their working lives. Chalmers said the change would “help deliver a more secure retirement for 1.3 million Australians, of which around 60% are women”. Up to 3.1 million Australians will now be eligible for the Listo. Are more people affected by this new plan, and by how much? The government says the changes at the top end of balances will still affect around the same number of people, about 0.5% of taxpayers. The original proposal was expected to raise $2.7bn in its first full year. The revised plan will instead raise $1.6bn in its first year. Chalmers said the net impact on the budget over the next four years would be about $4.2bn, with a major part due to its one-year delay. Is there bipartisan support for the new plan? The original plan did not muster enough support to pass in the previous parliament. Both the Coalition and Greens have held their cards close to their chest about this plan, waiting for more details. However, O’Brien did call the government’s backdown “a victory for the Coalition of commonsense”, and the changes “a full knock-down rebuild of an utterly failed policy.” The Greens were open to the Listo changes and the indexation, but wanted to see the threshold amounts lowered – not lifted. Why are these super changes being announced now? Labor had unveiled the super tax plan in February 2023, and stood by it for two-and-a-half years despite mounting criticism. As late as Friday, Anthony Albanese had downplayed the prospect of imminent changes to the policy; but Chalmers said the changes had been approved by the Albanese cabinet’s expenditure review committee on Friday. Albanese is out of the country on a week of leave. He will return to work on Sunday, immediately flying to Washington DC to meet the US president, Donald Trump. Asked why now, Chalmers said the government had “taken our time to work through the issues”. “We didn’t react quickly to every editorial or every criticism from every quarter,” he said. “When it comes to the feedback that we’ve had for more than two years now, the objective there has been to separate the genuine feedback from the usual kind of predictable, partisan feedback that you get from time to time.” What does this mean for future policy? While there are the immediate impacts on the budget, some commentators have looked more broadly to what this change might say about the government’s appetite for change. Economist Chris Richardson, a longstanding commentator on the budget, said the broader story was about the ability of governments to hold their nerve and make big changes. On X, he wrote that “today’s timidity worries me”. “The true implication of today’s announcements is that it is getting harder and harder to change Australia. “A government with (1) a clear mandate for a tax that it announced a few years ago, with (2) a stunning majority, and with (3) an imploding opposition just blinked.” Asked about the government’s willingness to pursue difficult reform, Chalmers rejected such criticism. “This is difficult tax reform. This is about making the superannuation tax concessions more sustainable, and that’s never easy. So I don’t accept the characterisation that any of this is simple or easy or uncontested,” he said. “This one has been difficult. It’s been contentious, as you all know.”",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/oct/13/new-rules-have-been-proposed-for-your-super-heres-what-you-need-to-know,World,BBC,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/85deea9749c0f11bfdea7928b3af42132c5eccde/660_0_6175_4940/master/6175.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=0a1b51e889d0c533e6e2e0575ae8a7ed",2025-10-13T08:21:10+00:00,30331188bb3b168e070b8448c9988da58839ab29
8c48da75acd5,Labor’s watered-down super tax plan creates a fairer system – but it’s far from as fair as it should be,,"Labor has dramatically overhauled its $3m super tax legislation, and the policy is weaker for it. It’s still pushing in the right direction, just not as hard. None of this bodes well for Jim Chalmers ’ lofty vision of a boldly reforming Labor party in those heady early days after May’s landslide election victory. As Brendan Coates, the director of the Grattan Institute’s housing and economic security program, said: “I am less confident in broader super tax reform today than I was yesterday.” There was good news for millions of Australians who will get an overdue boost to the low income super tax offset, starting from mid-2027. Six changes to superannuation tax rules announced by treasurer Jim Chalmers – video Announcing the changes, the treasurer said “this is a fairer superannuation system from top to bottom”, adding that “14 times more people will benefit from the low income super changes than will be impacted by the better targeted tax concessions”. It does result in a fairer system, but still far from as fair as it should be. The better targeted superannuation concessions bill was introduced two years ago , but expired in July following the end of the last parliament. Sign up: AU Breaking News email Its aim was to curb the worst excesses of a system where half of the tax breaks ended up in the hands of the 10% highest earning Australians. It did that by doubling the tax on super earnings to 30% for balances above $3m – hardly a radical change, but, as mentioned, a step in the right direction. After Monday’s shake-up, the policy will now also increase the earnings tax to 40% for balances above $10m. Treasury reckons the same number of people will be affected – roughly 90,000 people when it’s introduced from mid-2026, one year later than planned to make time for another round of consultations. Yet the revised super tax policy will only raise an estimated $2bn in 2028-29 (its first full year of operation), compared to $2.7bn in its original form. The fact that the policy will immediately collect less revenue is the most obvious sign that Monday’s changes have resulted in a watered-down policy that will not go as far to fix the problem it was designed to address. That problem is that overly generous tax concessions, particularly on earnings, have biased the super system from being a vehicle to save for a comfortable retirement, and towards a taxpayer-funded inheritance scheme for the very rich. So why is the updated policy less effective than it was before? There are two major changes which both respond to often hyperbolic , albeit not completely unfair, criticisms of the original bill. The first and most potent criticism was that the extra earnings tax was levied on the notional – or “unrealised” – gains in the value of the super balances. Normally, a cash tax is applied to cash, or “realised”, earnings (like rental income), so this was unorthodox territory. Those lobbying against the proposals claimed, among other things, that cash-poor farmers would be forced to sell their farms to raise money to pay the extra annual tax. skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Breaking News Australia Get the most important news as it breaks Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The original bill would have taken a slice of that capital gain each year, but now it won’t. Treasury had originally claimed it was too difficult and expensive for funds to calculate annual profits for each member with more than $3m in super, but is now more confident it can be done without too much extra cost for the funds. What awaits is another year of consultation, with no guarantee the super industry will actually be able to get it done, although Chalmers said he has already been in contact with funds and doesn’t expect a fight. The treasurer said that in the longer term, the bill would still raise a “substantial” amount of money, but it would be much less than before. That’s also because of the other major change: lifting the thresholds in line with inflation every year. The initial legislation would have captured progressively more people over time as their super balances grew above $3m. Again, the sometimes hysterical criticism was that average workers would breach this threshold some time in the 2060s. Of course, future governments would have made changes to the threshold, as Chalmers pointed out. But indexing thresholds is common practice, which means fewer people will be breaching the threshold over coming years. What budget impact that will have remains to be seen, although it will be offset by the new extra tax on the higher threshold.

Nato’s Maritime Command last week shared photos of a French navy frigate tracking a Russian submarine near Brittany, saying the alliance maintained “ constant vigilance and maritime awareness across the Atlantic .” The images prompted speculation after a Telegram channel known for leaking Russian security information claimed the Novorossiysk submarine had suffered serious technical problems, including a fuel leak. On Monday, Russia’s Black Sea Fleet denied the claims , saying the diesel-powered submarine had surfaced “in accordance with international navigation rules” while transiting the English Channel after operations in the Mediterranean. Speaking from Egypt , French president Emmanuel Macron dismissed opposition calls for his resignation , insisting he would remain in office to safeguard the country’s stability. “Never forget that the mandate given by the French people is to serve, to serve and serve, and to provide answers to the questions of everyday French people, and to do everything possible for the independence of France ,” Macron told reporters in Sharm el-Sheikh. “That is the only thing that matters. The rest is the government’s business … I will continue to ensure stability,” he added. Macron also hit out at his opponents, accusing them of fuelling the current unrest. “Those political forces which have worked to destabilise prime minister Lecornu are solely responsible for the sense of disorder in France,” he said.

Photograph: Martin Lelievre/Reuters The reshuffle, intended to steady the ship after last week’s chaotic collapse of his first cabinet , has instead reignited tensions across the political spectrum and left president Emmanuel Macron facing the gravest challenge of his second term. Far-right leader Marine Le Pen declared that her the National Rally party and its allies will move to bring down the government, announcing a motion of no confidence in parliament. She urged Macron to dissolve the National Assembly and call new elections “to allow the French people to express themselves and choose a new majority for change.” Mathilde Panot , leader of the left wing France Unbowed, said her party had filed its own no-confidence motion “that will bring down Lecornu’s new government”. “The country has no time to lose,” she added. “ Lecornu will fall and Macron will follow.” The threat piles further pressure on an administration already struggling to command authority after Lecornu’s record-short tenure and a wave of anger over his cabinet choices. The turmoil coincides with another seismic moment for France’s political establishment: former president Nicolas Sarkozy will today learn when he will begin serving a prison sentence for corruption .

Hundreds were there from the early hours of Monday and tens of thousands more joined them as the morning went on where they watched live footage of events from large screens on two sides of the square. Video footage was shown of hostages speaking to their families prior to their release after Hamas permitted them to call their loved ones. Julie Kupershtein, the mother of hostage Bar Kupershtein, who was working at the Nova music festival as a paramedic when he was taken, spoke to him in a video call. She said: “Seeing my child after two years – everything is fine. Thank you to the soldiers, thank you to everyone. “We were in the compound, and suddenly I had a conversation, suddenly I saw Bar. I screamed to the sky. Crazy. To see them, these pure, righteous children, alive. I’m shaking all over.” Keir Starmer, the UK prime minister, said: “Today is the first, crucial phase in ending the war in the Middle East. Now we must deliver lasting peace and a secure future for the whole region. The UK is providing additional humanitarian aid for civilians in Gaza, and we will lead efforts to accelerate its reconstruction.” The EU’s foreign affairs chief, Kaja Kallas, welcomed the release of the first of the hostages and praised Trump’s role in this “crucial milestone towards peace”. “President Trump made this breakthrough possible,” she wrote.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/oct/13/israeli-hostage-release-hamas-gaza-last-living,World,BBC,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dceef55ad47f8e4fcc30acbf9cac33d1e6b31995/418_0_4164_3333/master/4164.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=1be290d748cc33e4682af388f21580e4",2025-10-13T08:04:24+00:00,f46d828b907dbfe23d6d05ef09f13c74b4439dcf
0dac4f22d917,Lloyds puts aside extra £800m for car finance compensation claims,,"Lloyds Bank has put aside an extra £800m to deal with possible compensation claims over the motor finance scandal, with its total provision rising to almost £2bn. The bank, one of the most exposed to an ongoing scandal in which drivers were overcharged for loans as a result of commission paid to car dealers, had previously set aside £1.15bn to deal with potential costs. However, it said on Monday that an additional charge of £800m reflected an increased likelihood of further historical cases, particularly those affected by discretionary commission arrangements (known as DCAs), being eligible for compensation. The new estimate comes after the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) published a 360-page consultation paper for its redress scheme. The regulator said last week the mis-selling scandal would cost banks £11bn overall, though it could rise to £12.4bn if all victims applied and secured payouts as part of the scheme. Payouts are expected to average £700 on an estimated 14m unfair deals. Lloyds said the ultimate outcome may “evolve in response to representations made by various parties as well as further legal proceedings and complaints or any other broader implications of the supreme court judgment . “However, the total £1.95bn provision, including both redress and operational costs, represents the group’s best estimate of the potential impact of the motor finance issue.” Lloyds shares rose by 1% early Monday morning. The Financing and Leasing Association, which represents car lenders, has warned for months that a multibillion-pound bill could disrupt the car finance market. This could lead to some providers offering fewer or more expensive loans, while others could go bust, it said. Last week, Hyundai Capital UK revealed it had put aside £34.5m for the motor finance issue for 2024, according to its latest Companies House filings. The UK division of Honda Finance Europe said it had ringfenced £62.2m for compensation. Both figures were released before the FCA announced the proposed scale of the compensation scheme, and therefore could be higher. skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Business Today Get set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morning Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Other lenders, including Santander UK, Barclays and Close Brothers are expected to shoulder most of the costs. Banks are forecast to account for 51% of the payouts, with captive lenders shouldering 47% and independent lenders about 2%, the FCA has estimated. The car finance debacle is one of the biggest financial scandals since payment protection insurance (PPI) mis-selling, where 34 million consumers received an average of about £1,000 each.

6caa5ff7cdc7,One of Europe’s biggest farm machinery firms halts US exports over ‘hidden’ tariffs,,"One of Europe’s biggest farm machinery companies, Krone, has been forced to pause exports of large equipment to the US because of “alarming” and little-known new tariffs that are hitting hundreds of products from knitting needles and hair dryers to combine harvesters. Among the products on the steel derivatives list drawn up in consultation with US manufacturers, Donald Trump is taxing 407 specific products ranging from tiny embroidery stilettos to cooker hoods, barbecues, fridges, freezers, dishwashers, hair curling tongs, grills, elevators, bridge and railway structures, agriculture equipment and wind turbines. It has meant that since 18 August, companies such as Krone and the construction company Liebherr in Germany have to provide an unprecedented level of detail to customs border authorities certifying the origin, weight and value of any steel in their products right down to nuts and bolts. “You have to get paperwork from the supplier to the supplier to the supplier. That is pretty much impossible,” said Oliver Richtberg, the head of foreign trade at the German engineering federation VDMA, one of the most influential trade bodies in Europe. He described the EU/US trade deal , struck in July, as “not worth the paper it is written on”. “Von der Leyen speaks of stability, for our industry that is 100% not true. The bureaucratic hurdles are so high that some companies have just stopped exporting to the US,” added Richtberg. Krone, which is based in Lower Saxony in Germany and has 10,000 employees, was among those immediately hit. Bernard Krone, the boss of Krone, said the new tariffs came as ‘a big shock’. Photograph: Krone Bernard Krone, the fourth generation chair of the company, said the new tariffs, which fall outside the EU deal, came as “a big shock” as the US was its second biggest market, worth $130m (£97m) a year. He thought the EU-US deal struck in July was “not perfect” but offered predictability until the steel derivative list was published on 18 August. “That list was very alarming for us. Added to that nobody could tell us what to do. Did the tariffs depend on weight, origin, or the price of raw steel?” said Krone. While international headlines have focused on the 15% blanket tariff agreed by the EU, this separate list of 407 products is a rolling nightmare for exporters as the US has also set new rules allowing it to be changed several times a year . To get their machines into the US, Krone and every other exporter has to certify the value and origin of any element of steel in their product. With as many as 18,000 parts in the super-machines farming some of the world’s biggest farms, that has proved a challenge for Krone. And getting paperwork work wrong could prove costly. Flexport, a US logistics and freight company, says the guidelines advise customs authorities to apply the 200% tariffs on Russian imports to any steel derivative product on the hitlist with “incorrect” paperwork, withholding refunds until paperwork is in order. skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Business Today Get set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morning Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

In August he immediately extended holidays for his workers by two weeks, pausing exports to the US and temporarily suspending production on some lines. But after weeks of talking to lawyers on both sides of the Atlantic and officials in the US, he is still not confident he knows what paperwork US customs authorities need. Instead of risking shipping its bigger and costliest machines such as forage harvesters that can cost £600,000, the company will send a “test container” of smaller machines in the coming weeks with mowers, rakes and tedders, which turn and cut grass to speed up the drying process for hay making. “This wee, maybe next week, we will ship them over, and then four weeks later we will know if we have the paperwork right. It is nerve-racking,” Krone said. Asked what his US customers were saying, he said: “Many of them are surprised. When they saw Mr Trump talk about tariffs, they got the impression that the foreign companies are paying these tariffs, but what they now figure out is that it is the customer who pays. “If the farmers’ prices go up, then at the end of the day it is the US citizen who goes into Walmart or Target who has to pay more for their daily goods.” Providing a paper trail that essentially proves to the US that every nail, nut or bolt did not originate in China is a bureaucratic nightmare. The EU’s trade commissioner, Maroš Šefčovič, told a conference in Dublin last week that the new paperwork was “very, very challenging” and he has written to the commerce secretary, Howard Lutnick, to address them. Bernie Hart, the vice-president of customs and business development at Flexport, says the new requirements are in the “top tier” of complexity his business has dealt with as they “require new, granular data, country of melt and pour (steel), and country of primary smelt and cast (aluminum), often down to a stock-taking unit” level which can offer track minutiae such as colour and size of a product.

97b14841c823,MPs expected to grill minister over collapse of China spy trial as Commons resumes after recess – UK politics live,,"Jonathan Powell praised as 'incredible' by Trump envoy as MPs prepare to debate his role in collapse of China spy trial Good morning. Keir Starmer will be in Egypt today, attending the Middle East peace summit being co-chaired by Donald Trump. The PM will be a minor figure in a huge global story, and Yohannes Lowe is covering it all on our Middle East live blog. At Westminster MPs are returning to the Commons after the four-week conference recess where the news here won’t be making global headlines. But, in a curious twist, a tweet from Steve Witkoff, President Trump’s peace envoy, has managed to link Gaza with the main talking point in Westminster politics this morning. About two hours ago Witkoff posted this on X . I would like to acknowledge the vital role of the United Kingdom in assisting and coordinating efforts that have led us to this historic day in Israel. In particular, I want to recognize the incredible input and tireless efforts of National Security Advisor Jonathan Powell. This seemed to be a response to what Mike Huckabee , the US ambassador to Israel, posted on X yesterday in a comment on a video clip of Bridget Phillipson, the education secretary, saying in a Sunday morning interview that the UK had played a key role behind the scenes in shaping the peace deal announced by Trump. Huckabee, a Trump/Netanyahu loyalist who has been scathing in public before about the Labour government’s foreign policy, said: I assure you she’s delusional. She can thank @realDonaldTrump anytime just to set the record straight. The Witkoff tweet read like an White House-sanctioned mini rebuke, and a reassurance to London that the ambassador was not speaking on behalf of the administration. But Witkoff’s decision to also go public with lavish praise for Powell also implies that he is trying to be helpful to the UK national security adviser when he is under intense pressure because the opposition parties are blaming him for the collapse of the China spy trial. Here is Peter Walker’ s overnight story on this. Powell is under increasing pressure because, with recess over, MPs can now use all the parliamentary levers available to them to demand a fuller explanation from ministers as to what happened. They can table urgent questions, or even use the SO24 (standing order 24) procedure to demand an emergency debate. Lindsay Hoyle, the Speaker, was furious about the decision to drop the spying prosecution (because it involved allegations of spying happening within parliament) and he is likely to be sympathetic to requests for UQs or emergency debates. When ministers know that a UQ is likely to be granted, they often decide to make a formal ministerial statement instead. This is what Hamish Falconer , the Middle East minister, implied would happen in a Today programme interview this morning. Asked if the public would get a proper explanation in parliament as to why the spy trial collapsed, he replied: I will not get ahead of the Speaker on what is tabled in parliament, but I would expect that parliament will discuss this later. Falconer was referring to the fact that the Speaker’s Office only formally announces what statements and UQs are being allowed at about 1pm on a Monday. Powell is being blamed for the collapse of the trial because it is alleged he refused to agree to the government giving the prosecution a statement saying China is a threat to national security, and that without this the prosecution could not make this case. It is alleged Powell held back to avoid antagonising the Chinese government. Ministers say the decision to drop the case was taken by the Crown Prosecution Service, not the government, and that they were constrained by what official government policy was at the time the alleged offences were committed – when the Conservatives were in power. In his Today interview Falconer offered a slightly new version of this argument, saying the Official Secrets Act should be been updated sooner. He said: There was a case taken about alleged offences under the Official Secrets Act, which is a rather archaic piece of legislation … which was written in 1911. The case, unfortunately, involves a period before successor legislation was put in place in 2023 [the National Security Act]. So the CPS, who do these things, rightly, independently from government, were trying to put together a case based on evidence from both a period where the Official Secrets Act, rather than National Security Act was the legislation in place, and it was this Conservative government, rather than the Labour government, who were in place. Here is the agenda for the day. Morning: Kemi Badenoch is visiting Grantham to mark the 100th anniversary of the day Margaret Thatcher was born. 10.30am: Kate Forbes, Scotland’s deputy first minister, opens the final day of the SNP’s conference in Aberdeen. John Swinney, the first minister, winds up the conference with a speech at 3.05pm. 11.30am: Downing Street holds a lobby briefing. 12.30pm (UK time): Keir Starmer is due to meet President Trump at the Middle East peace summit in Sharm el-Sheikh that Trump is co-chairing with the Egyptian president, Abdel Fattah al-Sisi. 2.30pm: Steve Reed, the housing secretary, takes questions in the Commons. After 3.30pm: There are likely to be several urgent questions and ministerial statements, including one on the collapse of the China spy trial.

6b39c3306888,Markets rebound amid latest US-China tariff spat as traders look to possible ‘Taco trade’,,"European stock markets have edged higher and cryptocurrencies rebounded amid signs that a new front in the US-China trade war may not be a severe as first feared. Tensions between Washington and Beijing escalated again on Friday and over the weekend , as Donald Trump threatened to impose additional US tariffs of 100% on China starting next month. The US president accused the country of “very hostile” moves to restrict exports of rare earth minerals needed for American industry. Beijing said it would retaliate if Trump does not back down. However, Trump and senior US officials opened a door to a possible deal with China on Sunday. The president wrote on Truth Social: “Don’t worry about China, it will all be fine! Highly respected President Xi just had a bad moment. He doesn’t want Depression for his country, and neither do I. The U.S.A. wants to help China, not hurt it!!!” The comments have offered some comfort for investors in Europe, with stocks opening mostly higher on Monday. The UK’s blue-chip FTSE 100 index rose by 0.2% in early trading, while markets in France, Spain, Germany were all up by about 0.5%. Most big cryptocurrencies rebounded after a deep sell-off over the weekend. Bitcoin edged up by 0.3% to more than $115,000, after falling below $105,000 on Friday. Ether had dropped to less than $3,500 but rebounded to about $4,100. Richard Hunter, of the broker Interactive Investor, said investors were hoping for a “Taco trade”, which is the idea that markets rally because “Trump Always Chickens Out” (Taco) of aggressive tariff decisions. “The president’s propensity to shoot from the hip unsettles the investment environment, even though some are already speculating that the Taco trade is alive and well,” he said. However, a heightened sense of uncertainty is pushing investors to gold, which is considered a safe haven asset. Its spot price hit another new high on Monday, rising to as high as $4,078.5 an ounce. Derren Nathan, of the broker Hargreaves Lansdown, noted that US stock futures suggested that there could be “at least a partial rebound” when the market opens later this afternoon. “Traders may be banking on a similar pattern where American indexes entered a six-month period of almost unbroken growth helped by a string of trade deals, and growing hopes of a soft-landing for the US economy,” he said. skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Business Today Get set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morning Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

6d84dde52bcb,"Emissions linked to Woodside’s Scarborough gas project could lead to at least 480 deaths, research suggests",,"Greenhouse emissions linked to a gas field being developed by Australian fossil fuel company Woodside could lead to the death of at least 480 people and expose more than half a million to unprecedented heat, new research suggests. Scientists from six universities have examined the climate impact of the $16.5bn Scarborough project , which is expected to start production off the northern Western Australian coast next year and could result in 876m tonnes of carbon dioxide being released into the atmosphere over three decades. Emissions from the project would contribute 0.00039C to global heating, they estimate. Using recently developed techniques known as climate attribution , they suggest that fraction of warming would expose an additional 516,000 people globally to unprecedented heat, and result in the loss of an extra 16m coral colonies in the Great Barrier Reef in every future bleaching event. It would also push 356,000 people outside the “human climate niche” – the reasonable zone for human survival, with an upper limit for average annual temperature of 29C. The study, published in the journal Climate Action, forms part of a new focus in climate science that aims to quantify the impacts of individual fossil fuel projects and emitters. A Woodside spokesperson said the company would reduce the Scarborough project’s “direct greenhouse gas emissions to as low as reasonably practicable by incorporating energy efficiency measures in design and operations”. “Climate change is caused by the net global concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere,” they added. “It cannot be attributed to any one event, country, industry or activity.” Sign up to get climate and environment editor Adam Morton’s Clear Air column as a free newsletter But study co-author Andrew King, an associate professor in climate science at the University of Melbourne, said the research illustrated that individual projects had tangible climate impacts. “Often the argument made for individual projects that would involve greenhouse gas emissions is that they are quite small [in the global context],” he said. “But really, especially with larger fossil fuel projects, we can very clearly say that the impacts are not negligible.” Study co-author Sarah Perkins-Kirkpatrick, a professor of climate science at the Australian National University, said that given Australia’s emission reductions requirements , in the coming decades Scarborough would also constitute a greater proportion of the country’s CO2 emissions budget. “By 2049, assuming that the Scarborough project emits the same amount year on year, it’s going to be chewing up half of our emissions budget,” Perkins-Kirkpatrick said. “That’s the stuff that we burn here, let alone what we export overseas.” Beyond 2050, emissions from Scarborough would require CO2 removal from the atmosphere – “technologies that either don’t exist yet, or that we can’t scale up”, she said. skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Clear Air Australia Adam Morton brings you incisive analysis about the politics and impact of the climate crisis Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Taking into account a reduction in cold-related deaths in Europe, they estimate a net contribution of 118 additional deaths. The researchers calculated the project’s climate impacts with a tool used by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, called the Transient Climate Response to CO2 Emissions (TCRE). The TCRE estimates that every 1,000 gigatonnes of CO2 emissions causes 0.45C of additional global heating. Scarborough’s contribution to global heating had a likely range between 0.00024C and 0.00055C, the study’s authors estimated, but they noted “direct measurement of global mean temperature changes is not possible with this level of precision”. The approach could be used by governments and companies to assess whether future “projects fall within acceptable levels of environmental and societal risk”, the researchers suggest. The tool “could be part of the process for determining whether a project should be approved”, King said. Yuming Guo, a professor of global environmental health and biostatistics at Monash University, who was not involved in the study, said the study provided “a valuable tool for conducting environmental risk assessments”. “Considering the vast number of fossil fuel projects operating globally, the cumulative contribution of these emissions to climate change is substantial and should not be overlooked,” he said.

Clare Heath-McIvor, daughter of City Builders church pastor Brian Heath, told the parliamentary inquiry into cults and organised fringe groups that leaders of some churches in the New Apostolic Reformation movement, of which her father’s church is a part, believe “God’s law” overrides the state’s. “Practices like ‘gay conversion’ therapy, which is properly called sexual orientation or gender identity change efforts, even though that is illegal … I have grave concerns that it’s still happening because, according to them, the government of God is higher,” Heath-McIvor said. “This practice, even though it has been proven to be only harmful and has been classified by the UN as torture, still goes on in places like this.” Heath-McIvor also told the inquiry she was aware of women in the church who had been raped but had been discouraged from going to police for the same reason. “I’ve also heard from survivors who were raped, who then told my mum and dad about that rape, and were told that they cannot have an abortion if [it] is a product of rape, that they cannot report that to the police, because we don’t trust the government of man. We trust the government of God,” Heath-McIvor said. She told the inquiry this occurred on “more than one occasion”. Sign up: AU Breaking News email Practices that seek to change or suppress a person’s sexual orientation or gender identity have been banned in Victoria since 2022 . Led by the legislative assembly’s legal and social issues committee, the inquiry is not examining specific religious groups or their beliefs but rather the methods they use to attract and retain members – and whether those practices amount to coercion that should be criminalised. Heath-McIvor stressed that “not all churches are cults” but she said the City Builders Church was a “high-control group”. “We didn’t look ‘culty’. We were mostly nice and friendly and pretty affable, at least on the surface,” she said. She said her father took over the church, located in Sale in eastern Victoria, when she was about eight or nine, describing it as an “unremarkable evangelical church up until that point”. Home-schooled from year 1 through to year 12, she said she worked at McDonald’s from the age of 14 alongside other teenagers from the church – a group dubbed “the God Squad” – and was required to give 20% of her pay to the church as tithes. One of Heath-McIvor’s earliest memories of resisting the church was when she was about 16. She said she was “hauled out into the car park and made to repent” during one of her father’s sermons because she “wasn’t jumping in worship”. She said she was “literally surveilled” and had attempted to leave several times but wasn’t able to. On one occasion, she was sent to a “sister church”, where she was placed in an “abusive situation”. “When I disclosed these to dad, he said, ‘Don’t come home till it’s fixed. This is on you. Don’t ruin the work,’” she said. “So I was basically put in the path of my abuser again and again and again.” Heath-McIvor and her husband left the church in 2016. She told the inquiry they had married six years earlier in an “arranged marriage to a ‘gay conversion success story’.” In 2019, she helped her husband come out as gay, and their marriage ended in 2020. skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Breaking News Australia Get the most important news as it breaks Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

She said she will “likely never recover” from the damage sustained by the church. “The loss of family is something I grieve every day, and we can’t be reconciled due to the cult divide,” Heath-McIvor said. A spokesperson for City Builders said the church had been “living under the cloud of serious false allegations and related nationwide media coverage for several years”. They said they had made their own submission “to correct the record” and would let the process run its course. Submissions to the inquiry are yet to be made public. The inquiry also heard from Laura McConnell from the Two by Two Christian sect, with most of her evidence given in private. She said the group had “endemic levels of [child sexual assault], family violence, financial control and coercion”. “In my own life, over a 10-year period in my childhood, 75% of the ‘Workers’, or clergy, who came into my community now have allegations of abuse against them; 50% of them abused me,” McConnell said. “I recall being sexualised and expected to protect myself from predators from around the age of eight years old. I experienced abuses and cover-ups from both men and women in the Two by Two community.” She said the group was not even a formally registered religious organisation, meaning survivors were unable to access the National Redress Scheme.

fb372a1bac54,Sussan Ley praised for ‘standing up for democracy’ as Labor’s freedom of information crackdown looks set to fail,,"The Labor government’s changes to limit access to freedom of information (FoI) requests appear to be dead in the water, with the opposition leader, Sussan Ley , saying the Coalition will vote against the “friendless” proposal. After the Greens and key crossbenchers also voiced their outrage, there currently appears to be no pathway for the government to pass the reforms through the Senate. But the attorney general, Michelle Rowland, says she remains committed to the contentious reform, criticising the Coalition for once again reshuffling its frontbench and naming yet another new shadow legal spokesperson. In an op-ed published in the Canberra Times on Monday, Ley wrote “the opposition will stand firmly against these changes”. The shadow attorney general, Julian Leeser, had previously spoken strongly against the proposal, labelling it a “truth tax” , but had not formally committed the Coalition to opposing the changes, pending a parliamentary inquiry and a security briefing from the government. Coalition sources said Ley’s op-ed was the first explicit commitment to voting against the FoI changes. “We will defend the principles of openness and accountability that are essential to a healthy democracy,” Ley wrote in the Canberra Times. “This is not an administrative refinement or merely updating old laws, as the prime minister claims. It is a retreat from transparency.” Sign up: AU Breaking News email It is understood the government had offered the opposition a briefing on why it believed the changes were necessary. The government last month announced the biggest changes to transparency rules in a generation, including new charges for FoI requests and tighter rules around access to information which could see more requests either refused or more heavily redacted. It would impose a time limit on how long public servants spend on each request, effectively curbing what information can be sought. The Albanese government has already been criticised by the Centre for Public Integrity for curbing information from FoI requests, reporting in July that the number of FoI requests granted in full decreased from 59% in 2011-12 to 25% in 2023-24, while outright refusals doubled from 12 to 23% in the same period. Rowland has argued artificial intelligence-generated mass requests could flood the FoI system, that current rules are wasting time and resources of government departments, and raised concerns about foreign governments or malicious actors seeking information. Officials from her department could not cite detailed examples of this in Senate estimates last week. Current rules already hold exemptions for national security risks, unnecessarily complex requests, and “irrelevant” information. In a statement, Rowland’s spokesperson called the Coalition’s position “both premature and confused”. “On one hand, the Coalition has said they will wait until they get a security briefing before coming to a final position, and on the other they’re announcing policy positions in opinion pieces,” the spokesperson said, adding the government “remains committed” to the reform. The independent senator David Pocock, a critic of the FoI changes, praised Ley’s stance. He wrote on social media: “Good to see the opposition recognise these deep flaws – the bill should not pass.” skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Breaking News Australia Get the most important news as it breaks Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

In a written statement, Leeser accused the Labor government of overseeing “a surge in FoI refusals”, as well as criticising the government’s use of non-disclosure agreements when consulting with stakeholder groups, and failing to meet deadlines set by the Senate to produce documents. He noted that most submissions to the parliamentary inquiry had been critical of the change. On Monday, Ley also announced a shadow ministry reshuffle which will see Leeser transferred from shadow attorney general to shadow education minister. Andrew Wallace, currently the shadow cabinet secretary, will take up the shadow attorney general role. “The Government will not be lectured about matters related to the Attorney-General’s portfolio by a party who just today announced their fourth change to the position of shadow Attorney-General in less than four years,” Rowland’s spokesperson added in their response to Ley’s op-ed. Senator Jonno Duniam, now the education shadow, will move into the home affairs portfolio. That role was left vacant by the resignation of Andrew Hastie, who quit as shadow home affairs minister after a dispute with Ley.

eb181c2f42d2,Two men charged with prison murder of Lostprophets singer Ian Watkins,,"Convicted child sex offender Watkins was attacked with a knife at HMP Wakefield on Saturday

Two men have been charged with murder after the death in prison of the former Lostprophets singer and convicted child sex offender Ian Watkins.

Rashid Gedel, 25, and Samuel Dodsworth, 43, have both been charged with murder and will appear before Leeds magistrates’ court on Monday morning, West Yorkshire police said.

Watkins, 48, was serving a 29-year sentence at HMP Wakefield, with a further six years to be served on licence, after admitting a string of sex offences including the attempted rape of a baby.

Watkins was arrested after the execution of a drugs warrant at his Pontypridd home on 21 September 2012, when a large number of computers, mobile phones and storage devices were seized.

411b5ed5d0d5,Voters’ voices are being shut out of British politics. Your Party has a radical plan to change that,,"A t Labour’s latest conference, one thing stood out: the party no longer believes in democracy. Members and trade union affiliates voted to back , first the findings of a UN commission of inquiry that Israel is committing genocide , and second that the government must do all it can to prevent it. It is now two weeks since this motion was passed, but still the Labour government refuses to recognise the genocide in Gaza and allows the supply of weapons to Israel. Over the past 40 years in parliament, I have witnessed at first-hand the democratic deficit in our political system. For too long, top-down political parties have disempowered their membership and crushed internal debate. Now, Your Party will try to do something unprecedented in British politics: forge a mass, democratic party from scratch. When we launched, we announced that members would decide the policies, the strategy and even the name. In the meantime, we called it Your Party . It was an apt choice because it expressed the essence of what we are trying to build: a new kind of political party that belongs to its members. In November, we are hosting our inaugural founding conference. This will be the moment that members come together to decide the direction of the party, the models of leadership, and the strategies we need to win. We want our conference to be participatory, open and democratic. Members will be chosen at random to come to the conference in person and debate our founding documents. Then, every member will get the final say online through one member, one vote. This conference will not come out of the blue. It will be the product of a series of mass, regional assemblies up and down the country. More than just rallies, these assemblies will be an opportunity for communities to come together to discuss and debate the key questions facing the future of our party and our country. A democratic party isn’t an end in itself. It will provide the space for people to organise, together, for a radically different society. When highly centralised political parties answer to nobody but themselves, you get policies that nobody asked for. You get privatisation of our public services. You get austerity. You get 4.5 million children living in poverty in one of the richest countries in the world. When political parties are democratically accountable to their members, you get policies that the British people want and need. I’ll go further: undemocratic parties produce undemocratic societies, where a small section of society owns the resources we all need to survive. Democratic parties produce democratic societies; where wealth and resources are owned by us all. Take public ownership, for example. Currently, a small number of companies control the production of basic resources, to the detriment of us all. Everyone relies on these services, yet it is unaccountable shareholders who decide how they are run. Public ownership means giving communities the power to decide how to run the services they provide and consume. This is the heart of socialism: the extension of democracy into every sphere of life. And that is at the heart of Your Party. For too long, people have been shut out of our political system. We are doing things differently: we are putting power in your hands. Those who want to stand in the way of transformative change want to suppress the rights, voices and power of ordinary people. Their greatest fear is democracy – because democracy is our greatest strength. skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Matters of Opinion Guardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and more Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

70a921d71552,"Education cuts in prisons ultimately endanger the public, watchdog says",,"Cuts to education in prisons are derailing offenders’ work and training and ultimately endangering the public, the prisons watchdog has warned. Repeat offenders “cause mayhem” in their communities because of the failure of prisons to provide education, training and work that could help to break the cycle of offending, the chief inspector of prisons, Charlie Taylor, said. A thematic report from the inspectorate said “this already unacceptable situation” was only likely to get worse as real-terms cuts began to “eat into already stretched education provision”. The Guardian disclosed last month that prisons were cutting frontline spending on education by up to 50%, despite promises from Keir Starmer to improve “access to learning” in last year’s general election manifesto. The spending cuts are being introduced as the government rolls out new education contracts across prisons in England and Wales. While the overall education budget has remained the same, the cost of course contracts has soared, governors claim. Taylor said: “I have serious concerns about the impact of real-terms education budget cuts on already inadequate provision and about the lack of real appetite and ambition for improvement that this represents. “The Prison Service has a duty to protect the public by making prisoners less likely to reoffend when they are released, but too often it is failing to fulfil this responsibility. “There is little doubt that many prisoners already leave jail and return to criminality, creating more victims of crime. These devastating cuts are likely to make this situation worse. “The best governors know that jails, and ultimately our communities, are safer if prisoners are purposefully occupied, and that education, training and work play a vital role in motivating prisoners to turn their lives around. “Until leaders in the Prison Service take the provision of high-quality education and training more seriously, it is hard to see how appallingly high reoffending rates can be reduced.” Labour promised to reduce reoffending in its manifesto and work with prisons to improve prisoners’ access to purposeful activity such as learning. The cuts would also hinder Labour’s efforts to introduce a new incentive-based prison regime that would allow inmates to earn time off their sentence by completing work, training and education courses. A report by the prison inspectorate found that 94 of 104 closed prisons inspected before the cuts came into effect this month were rated “poor” or “not sufficiently good” for purposeful activity. Just 31% of prison leavers are in employment six months after release, according to Ministry of Justice figures. skip past newsletter promotion Our morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it matters Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The review, which took place alongside inspections of 11 men’s and two women’s prisons, showed too many prisoners spent their days locked in their cells, and overcrowding, a lack of workshop space and instructors, equipment failures and ageing infrastructure had compounded the situation. Many prisoners waited weeks to be allocated an activity space and were often given what was available, the report said, rather than training relevant to their career prospects on release. For those who did gain a space, there was no guarantee they would be able to attend, the report said. Regime curtailments, security lockdowns and staff indifference about unlocking prisoners meant average attendance was just 67% in the prisons visited for the review. Even when work went ahead, full-time jobs generally occupied prisoners for just five hours a day, with many roles split into part-time places to stretch meagre provision further, inspectors found. James Timpson, the prisons minister, has repeatedly emphasised the importance of prison education and training. In July, Lord Timpson wrote: “We know that purposeful activity can help to enable safe and decent prisons and have a transformative effect on reoffending rates … This is why the government committed to working with prisons to improve access to purposeful activity in its manifesto and is actively exploring the best approaches to do so.”",https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/oct/13/education-cuts-in-prisons-ultimately-endanger-the-public-watchdog-says,World,BBC,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/249f5fb7b8f4696a4fc994f1cf68d8c2e3e63adf/195_0_3937_3149/master/3937.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=f81b09fd40864b0992c55e79145130aa",2025-10-13T09:55:24+00:00,a67e97eef324c50d962d5a291487af347847c2fd
544c9b5e5093,Kate Bush and artists harness power of Running Up That Hill for War Child appeal,,"Kate Bush is harnessing the power of her global hit Running Up That Hill in collaboration with leading names in British art to raise money for children caught up in global conflicts. The singer-songwriter invited 52 visual artists to respond to her lyric “If I only could, I’d make a deal with God” from her 1985 anthem. One of her best-loved songs and hailed as “one of the greatest songs of all time” by Rolling Stone, it became a hit all over again in 2022 when it featured in the fourth season of the US TV series Stranger Things. Maggi Hambling, once described as the “original bad girl of art” and Peter Doig, whose paintings have sold for millions , are among those to contribute works interpreting the lyric for the fundraiser Sound & Vision, named after David Bowie’s 1977 hit. All the works will feature in an online auction , from 28 October to 13 November, with starting bids at £100, to raise money for the charity War Child , which protects, educates, and stands up for the rights of children living in war zones. Midnight Wave by Maggi Hambling. Photograph: Maggi Hambling Announcing the project, Bush said: “All wars leave horrific scars; ruined lives, families ripped apart, life-changing injuries, trauma, and loss on a massive scale – but it’s the children who suffer the most in so many ways. Their past, present and future melt away into fear and uncertainty. “It is more important than ever we support War Child and their invaluable work providing immediate aid to children caught in conflict all over the world including in Ukraine, Gaza, Sudan and Syria. Projects like Sound & Vision harness the power of art and music to make a real difference to children living through war.” Kate Bush photographed in London, 1978. Photograph: Gered Mankowitz/Iconic Images Doig has contributed two signed pieces: The Hill, on the theme of the crucifixion, and Child of War depicting a child looking at a figure on horseback. Hambling’s contribution is titled Midnight Wave. Charlie Calder-Potts, Britain’s youngest female official war artist who worked with the British army in Afghanistan, and who has since travelled the world creating work in Iran, Pakistan, Tajikistan and at Yazidi refugee camps in Iraq, has created a new work. So too have Corbin Shaw, known for textiles, prints and flags capturing modern-day Britishness through ancient crafts; Susie Hamilton, a former artist-in-residence at St Paul’s Cathedral whose portraits of doctors, nurses and patients facing Covid-19 are held by the Science Museum; and Unskilled Worker, AKA Helen Downie, who discovered painting aged 48 and shot to industry-wide fame, growing an Instagram following of more than 280,000 followers.

Bowie helped curate a fundraising exhibition for the charity in 1994 called Little Pieces from Big Stars , which 30 years later was the inspiration for the first Sound & Vision last year with artists responding to the lyric “We like dancing and we look divine” from his song Rebel Rebel. The curator Gemma Peppé, the founder of Art on a Postcard, said Bush’s lyric had “prompted some great contemporary artists to produce some vibrant and evocative work”. She said Doig had asked if he could take part. “I nearly fell off my chair. That’s a testament to the great work War Child does.” Charlotte Nimmo from War Child UK, which is present in a number of active conflict zones including Ukraine and Gaza, said: “We are delighted to announce that Sound & Vision is returning, this year inspired by lyrics from the incredible Kate Bush.

Mark Francis Ford, once a member of the religious order colloquially known as the Vincentians, ministered within the archdiocese of New Orleans as well as the dioceses of Dallas and Gallup, New Mexico , after his ordination in 1992. He is accused of raping a boy whom he met through a program that he helped start in New Orleans named God’s Special Children – which serves youths who are disabled – before and after the Vincentians say Ford successfully asked the Vatican to laicize him, or remove him from the priesthood, in 2007. Word of Ford’s arrest in September in Indiana, where he was working for a hunger-relief non-profit, on a warrant obtained by New Orleans police prompted media and BishopAccountability.org director Terry McKiernan to examine his career history. McKiernan found that Ford, 64, was not listed among active clergy members in the 1994, 1999, 2002 and 2003 editions of the Official Catholic Directory (OCD) – with such disappearances generally correlating “with problems in ministry that are not being managed in a transparent way, and/or periods during which the priest has been sent to a treatment center”. Only the earliest of those interruptions in ministry was explained in the news media. The Dallas Morning News reported in 1997 that Ford had previously entered a program in Albuquerque, New Mexico, administered by the Servants of the Paraclete. The provided reason was a problem with managing money, though that particular program is better known for treating a range of other issues, from substance abuse to pedophilia. McKiernan said his organization was “skeptical that this was the real reason that Ford was with the Servants of the Paraclete, whose mission in the early 1990s mostly involved priests who had abused children”. “Until documents are released that prove otherwise, we can only conclude that the problems revealed in Ford’s recent arrest and in the charges against him are also reflected in his … earlier disappearances from the OCD,” McKiernan said. Therefore, based on the finding of probable cause linked to the warrant leading to Ford’s arrest, McKiernan said it would be “a prudent measure” to add Ford to the lists of credibly accused clergymen previously released by the Vincentians as well as the three dioceses for which he worked. Those lists were among ones released by more than 200 other US dioceses and religious order chapters as a gesture of transparency amid the worldwide Catholic church’s decades-old clergy molestation scandal. They “inform the public, and in particular … notify survivors that other survivors may have come forward with credible allegations”. “When a bishop or superior confirms the credible status of an allegation, survivors find validation and consolation, and when a priest is still alive, children are protected,” McKiernan said. “We call on the three dioceses and his religious order to add Ford to their lists and provide a full accounting of his whereabouts and activities, especially during the years when the OCD was not disclosing that information.” A statement from a spokesperson for the US chapter of the Vincentians to which Ford belonged said individuals went on their institution’s list “when an accusation is deemed credible”. A spokesperson for the diocese of Gallup, whose boundaries include a part of Arizona, said it was working on a statement and would provide it to the Guardian once it was ready. Neither the Dallas diocese or the New Orleans archdiocese – which along with its insurers was preparing to pay at least $230m to settle hundreds of clergy sexual abuse claims – responded to requests for comment. God’s Special Children The most complete picture of Ford’s whereabouts during his time as a priest are largely contained in a work history that McKiernan compiled and provided to the Guardian – as well as contemporaneous news clippings. Citing information from the OCD, Ford was first assigned to the Dallas diocese’s Holy Trinity church, which was adjacent to a school with nearly 170 students. The school also counted more than 420 students enrolled in its catechesis and other religious programs. He disappeared from the 1994 OCD before spending 1995-1998 and 2000-2001 at the diocese of Gallup. Ford spent the first of those stretches assigned to both the Immaculate Heart of Mary and the St Jude churches in the Arizona communities of Page and Tuba City. After his 1999 disappearance from the OCD, he was assigned only to the Page church, which reported between 110 and 135 students in its catechesis and other religious programs during his two stretches there. Ford then vanished from the 2002 and 2003 OCDs before turning up in New Orleans from 2004 to 2006 at the St John the Baptist and the St Joseph churches, respectively in that community’s Central City and Tulane-Gravier neighborhoods. Mark Francis Ford after his arrest in Indiana in September. Photograph: Obtained by the Guardian He is also listed at the St Stephen church in New Orleans’ Touro neighborhood in 2005 and 2006 before his voluntary laicization. Another Vincentian priest assigned to St Stephen at the time, the late James Steinbach, would later land on the order’s credibly accused list . Media articles, including some quoting Ford, and various online biographical profiles add contours to that portrait. A 1997 profile of Ford in the Dallas Morning News quoted him as saying he was part Navajo, Chiricahua Apache and Zuni – while also acknowledging he spent seven months at a Servants of the Paraclete treatment center in Albuquerque. Ford claimed he needed to go there because he was a “compulsive spender, debtor and money mismanager” who depleted the financial accounts of both the Tuba City and Page churches, as the Gallup Independent newspaper recently reported. Asked whether it would confirm or deny whether Ford’s spending was the only reason he went to the Servants of the Paraclete, the spokesperson for the Vincentians said the order does not comment on personnel matters. Ford later claimed in an online biography of him associated with a role at the American Indian Center that he ministered on Navajo and Hopi reservations while in Arizona. In any event, once in New Orleans, Ford made headlines for having a hand in launching God’s Special Children at St Joseph alongside Jay Zainey, a judge, at the city’s federal courthouse. A 2005 article in the local Times-Picayune newspaper recounted how Zainey met Ford while attending mass at St John the Baptist. “In talking to Ford about his son, … who has autism as well as a rare chromosomal abnormality, Zainey said there was no Mass that his wife and their two other children … felt they could attend with [the son] without disturbing other worshippers,” the publication wrote. Ford at the time reportedly told the newspaper that he “recognized the Zaineys’ frustration, often shared by other parents with children with disabilities”. After meeting the Zaineys’ son, Ford discerned “a calling to serve those like [him]”. “I realized that children with disabilities are incredible gifts to the church,” Ford said to the Times-Picayune. He then celebrated the first God’s Special Children service in the fall of 2004. Zainey over the years has earned a reputation as one of the most pious Catholics in Louisiana’s most famous city. At one point, he publicly said it was his idea for New Orleans’ archbishop, Gregory Aymond , to turn to high-ranking executives of the city’s professional football team, the Saints, for help with media messaging concerning the local clergy abuse scandal. He also issued a ruling in favor of a Catholic religious order pushing to strike down a 2021 Louisiana law enabling clergy-abuse survivors to seek damages over decades-old child molestation. Yet the state’s supreme court later upheld the law, in effect negating Zainey’s ruling. The website for God’s Special Children now lists Zainey as the program’s founder, though as of Sunday a message attributed to him expressed gratitude for Ford’s support. Asked whether he would discuss Ford, Zainey declined, saying: “I haven’t seen him in many years.” Arrested in Indiana Ford’s American Indian Center biography says he became the Louisiana state government’s assistant director of disability affairs in 2006, the year after federal levee failures during Hurricane Katrina devastated New Orleans. He attributed being appointed to the job by then governor Kathleen Blanco, saying the Democrat’s administration tasked him with helping people with disabilities access resources and services after Katrina. Ford’s biography said the late Blanco’s Republican gubernatorial successor, Bobby Jindal, then appointed him to direct Louisiana’s office of Indian affairs, where his job was to assist efforts by the state’s Native tribes to recover from Hurricanes Gustav and Ike in 2008. He was then reported to have joined the US hunger relief non-profit Feeding America in 2021, with positions in Phoenix and Chicago. And the resident of Portage, Indiana, was listed as a board member of the American Indiana Center, as the Gallup Independent noted. In November, a man who described meeting him at age 10 in 2004 through God’s Special Children reported to New Orleans police that he had been sexually molested by Ford. The accuser – who is now 31 and lives with a degenerative spinal cord condition which occasionally requires him to get around in a wheelchair – underwent a series of forensic interviews before police then obtained a warrant to arrest Ford, said an attorney who represents him, Kristi Schubert. Schubert also said her client’s family had considered Ford a close friend at one point. The accuser is on the autism spectrum and has been legally determined to be a minor despite reaching the age of majority, leaving him under his mother’s permanent, lifelong guardianship, Schubert said. Records obtained by the Guardian show New Orleans police obtained a local judge’s permission to arrest Ford on 9 September on charges of first-degree rape, second-degree kidnapping, sexual battery and indecent behavior with a juvenile. Documents give the dates of the offenses as 1 November 2004 to 31 December 2014, and Ford would be subject to mandatory life imprisonment if eventually convicted as accused. Authorities then arrested Ford in Portage on 25 September, holding him without bail pending his transfer to New Orleans. Ford waived his right to challenge that transfer at a 1 October court hearing, but he remained in a jail in the Portage area as of Sunday. Schubert and her client’s family largely declined to comment after Ford’s arrest, saying they didn’t want to interfere with the criminal case against him. But she did share that her client for years had endured nightmares and fits of waking up screaming. His first night of uninterrupted sleep in recent memory came immediately after he learned Ford had been brought into custody by authorities aiming to hold him accountable, according to Schubert.

8f165c826588,Portugal’s far-right Chega falls well short of expectations in local elections,,"Portugal’s far-right Chega party has won its first mayoral seats in local elections, final results showed, but fell well short of expectations and its vote share halved from parliamentary elections in May. The six-year-old nationalist party, whose name means “Enough”, took control of three city halls: São Vicente on the island of Madeira; the central town of Entroncamento; and Albufeira in the south. It won a 11.86% share of the overall vote. But Chega’s leader, André Ventura, admitted “we wanted more” and said Sunday’s elections had not given the party “the victory we wanted”. Some pre-election polls had put Chega ahead in the national vote for the first time, and it had hoped its cocktail of populist policies, including stricter immigration controls and chemical castration for paedophiles, might help it win 30 municipalities. Chega won almost 23% of the vote in parliamentary elections , giving it 60 MPs and making it Portugal’s official opposition party. Analysts said the local election results suggested the party could underperform when its Ventura was not on the ballot. Ventura, a former columnist and football pundit, put on a brave face on Monday morning, telling supporters the results were “a great victory for Chega”, which was expanding to become a “party with a municipal base”. It almost trebled its vote share from the previous local elections in 2021, and will play a significant role in shaping policy in several councils. Of the three municipalities it captured, it won 49% of the vote in São Vicente, 40.5% in Albufeira in the Algarve – which Ventura has called the party’s “stronghold” , and the springboard for Portugal’s “conquest” by the far right – and 37% in Entroncamento. It was defeated, however, in several municipalities where it had high hopes of winning, including Faro, the Algarve’s biggest city, and Sintra outside Lisbon. skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to This is Europe The most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environment Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Kent police have also agreed to pay damages and legal costs to Laura Murton, 43, in connection with the 14 July incident in Canterbury in which armed officers told her her demonstration expressed views supportive of Palestine Action, which had been banned earlier that month. After the Guardian reported the incident, it was raised in parliament , in court – by a judge granting Palestine Action permission for judicial review of its proscription – and by the equalities watchdog when warning of “heavy-handed” policing of Gaza protests. A letter sent to Murton on behalf of the chief constable of Kent police, Tim Smith, admitted there had been a breach of her right to free speech and that the officers had breached national counter-terrorism policing guidance on the proscription of Palestine Action. Protester holding Palestine flag threatened with arrest by Kent police – video It also admitted unlawful processing of her data and Smith said he had directed that the data be deleted. The officers had said that they would arrest Murton unless she provided her name and address, which she reluctantly agreed to do. Responding to the settlement of the case , Murton, who said she would donate any compensation to Palestinian causes, said: “People should continue to exercise their lawful right to protest in support of Palestinian people despite the proscription of Palestine Action. I hope this case serves as a reminder to chief constables across the country that there should be no unlawful interference with those protest rights.” Her lawyer said it was the first time a chief constable had apologised and paid damages for unlawful policing arising from the proscription of Palestine Action. In the encounter, which Murton filmed, an officer told her: “Mentioning freedom of Gaza , Israel, genocide, all of that all come under proscribed groups, which are terror groups that have been dictated by the government.” He claimed the phrase “free Gaza” was “supportive of Palestine Action” and that “to express an opinion or belief that is supportive of a proscribed organisation, namely Palestine Action, is an offence under section 12(1A) of the Terrorism Act ”. The officer told her she had committed that offence. skip past newsletter promotion Our morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it matters Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

22c943d9d05c,"Climate investment is growth opportunity of 21st century, says economist",,"Investment in climate action is the economic growth story of the 21st century, while growth fuelled by fossil fuels is futile because the damage it causes ends in self-destruction, the economist Nicholas Stern has said. The plummeting costs of clean technologies, from renewable energy to electric cars, plus the healthier and more productive societies they enable, meant investments could simultaneously tackle the climate crisis and faltering economic growth, and bring millions of people out of poverty, he said. This requires big changes in policies and levels of investment and Stern, at the London School of Economics, acknowledged that the geopolitical environment was currently difficult but he said making the rational argument was vital. The US president, Donald Trump, recently called climate change a “ con job ” and is backing fossil fuel companies to “drill, baby, drill”. “I’d say to Trump: ‘You’ve got children and grandchildren – think about the science, think about the risks,’ and I’d give examples about the wildfires in California,” said Stern. “I’d point out to him that his place in Florida is going to be extremely vulnerable to more intense hurricanes, sea level rise and storm surges. The people and places he loves are under severe risk. “The science [of greenhouse gases heating the atmosphere] is simple science – this idea of a ‘con job’ is just wrong,” he said. “I’d point out to Trump that solar beats fossil fuels on electricity across most of the world, including in big parts of the US. The good folk of Texas will be investing in solar and wind because it’s cheaper than the alternatives. It’s much better to invest in the technologies of the 21st century rather than those of the 19th and 20th.” Stern led a landmark 2006 review that concluded climate action would cost less than the damage caused by inaction and that climate change was the greatest market failure the world had ever seen. His new book, The Growth Story of the 21st Century: The Economics and Opportunity of Climate Action, is published on 5 November . His conclusions from 2006 remain valid today but have intensified, he said, as the effects of global heating are arriving faster and with more severity than anticipated. “Every time you look at the science, it gets worse,” he said. For example, he said, the tipping points that were thought to be associated with 4C of global heating now look as if they could occur with about a 2C rise. Despite this, Stern said the economic opportunities climate action presented had also intensified, due to the extraordinary pace of technological development. The cost of solar power and batteries has fallen 80% in the last decade, with offshore wind costs down 73% and onshore wind down 57%. Stern said the growing economies of scale of climate technology, more efficient use of resources and healthier populations – fossil fuel air pollution kills millions a year – would all boost productivity and economic growth. “It’s a huge opportunity – cities where you can move and breathe are much more productive,” he said. “The world desperately needs to increase the rate of growth [and] low-carbon is the only feasible longer-run growth on offer; high carbon growth self-destructs.” Stern also had a message for the UK Conservative leader, Kemi Badenoch, who has pledged to scrap the Climate Change Act , and to Nigel Farage, the leader of Reform UK, which is leading in opinion polls, and has called the aim of net zero emissions by 2050 “lunacy”. “Make an effort to understand the imperative [for climate action] and recognise the huge opportunities,” he said. “Those opportunities are your growth story – inaction is catastrophic.” Analysis in February found the UK’s net zero sector was growing three times faster than the overall UK economy. The UK Office for Budget Responsibility said in July that the cost of achieving the net zero target was far lower than the cost of inaction, and that rapid declines in the cost of renewable energy meant it was now far cheaper to achieve the target than previously forecast. Stern said: “I am optimistic about what we can do but deeply worried about what we will do. We’re trying to bring the rational argument to the table and help shape the politics around the world. But If you’re saying that the political discussion is so difficult it cannot possibly be overcome by rational argument, then we’re in for a very hard time.”",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/oct/13/climate-investment-is-biggest-growth-opportunity-of-21st-century-says-economist-nicholas-stern,Business,BBC,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/286a84b8ef816a099951dc378f99d02d705969b6/655_0_3276_2621/master/3276.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=94897ffa306ee721c5bdf039174895e3",2025-10-13T10:17:37+00:00,4afa3ffc26c0b1206000c0d14deb875f9d09c0dc
60f87f537b16,"Reform UK abandoning manifesto pledge of £90bn in tax cuts, deputy leader admits",,"Reform UK’s deputy leader has admitted the party cannot deliver the £90bn in tax cuts promised in its manifesto, saying it would concentrate on public spending cuts once in government. Richard Tice said key election pledges such as lifting the income tax threshold would be an “aspiration” and that once in government Reform would concentrate on cutting the civil service and scrapping net zero . Reform’s leader, Nigel Farage, is said to be planning a speech next month to overhaul the party’s economic policy – which Labour and the Conservatives see as a key weakness. The Times reported that Farage would promise to reduce spending before reducing taxes . Farage has previously said he expected to make £350bn worth of spending cuts over the course of the parliament – the equivalent of axing the whole schools budget every year or wiping out a third of NHS funding annually. He has said he would find the savings via cuts to net zero, migrant hotels and diversity initiatives, but added the target figure was also widely expected to be revised. “A manifesto is based on a point in time,” Tice told Times Radio. “The principles behind it are absolutely rock solid. We said we’ve got to make very significant savings in order to fund a different way to run the economy. “What’s happened since then is that the state of the economy, because of the mismanagement by this Labour government, the numbers have got far worse. And we will be focusing relentlessly, as I’ve been saying, on the savings.” Policies in the manifesto included raising the inheritance tax threshold to £2m, lifting the income tax personal allowance to £20,000 and the higher rate to £70,000 and reducing corporation tax to 15%. It also included tax relief on private school fees and cuts to fuel duty. “As an aspiration, that is absolutely the plan, the principle behind it. But we cannot do any of this, given the state of the finances, until we deliver on the savings,” Tice said. “We’re focusing on the savings, deliver on the savings, deliver on the regulation cuts, that’s the way we change the way that you run and manage this economy, then you can get performance-related tax cuts further down the road only when you’ve delivered on the savings.” Reform has made a major play of finding cuts in local government after victories in the 2025 local elections – suggesting the party would send in cost-cutting teams modelled on the US president Donald Trump’s “department of government efficiency” (Doge). Tice said changes to regulations would make cost-cutting easier, saying they would not run up against the same issues nationally. “We will change the obligations that are set down by the government because we will completely, boldly change the way that the government functions, the way the civil service functions. skip past newsletter promotion Our morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it matters Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Working people simply cannot trust Reform. They offer anger but no answers,” the spokesperson said. “Only this Labour government is focused on renewing Britain, so that we can grow the economy and put money back in people’s pockets.” The Institute for Fiscal Studies has previously said the sums in Reform UK’s 2024 manifesto were implausible. “Regardless of the pros and cons of shrinking the state, or of any of their specific measures, the package as a whole is problematic,” it said. “Spending reductions would save less than stated, and the tax cuts would cost more than stated, by a margin of tens of billions of pounds per year.” The Conservative shadow chancellor, Mel Stride, said the plans were “all over the place … Reform stood on a platform last year of huge unfunded commitments which would have wrecked the public finances. They cannot be trusted to run our economy. “It’s Corbynism in a different colour – undeliverable, uncosted, and totally detached from reality.

0c1b49e2f91c,Trio win Nobel economics prize for work on technology-driven growth,,"Three experts in the power of technology to drive economic growth have been awarded this year’s Nobel prize in economics. Joel Mokyr of Northwestern University secured half of the 11m Swedish kronor (£867,000) prize, with the rest split between two other academics: Philippe Aghion of the Collège de France, Insead business school and the London School of Economics; and Peter Howitt of Brown University. Announcing the prize against a backdrop of rapid development in artificial intelligence and fierce debate over its impact on society and living standards, the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences said the trio had pioneered the explanation of “innovation-driven economic growth”. The award came as countries worldwide push to turn around years of lacklustre economic growth since the 2008 financial crisis, amid concerns over a slowdown in productivity gains, sluggish progress on raising living standards, and mounting political tensions. Aghion, a French economist, warned that “dark clouds” were gathering amid increasing barriers to trade and openness fuelled by Donald Trump’s trade wars. He also said innovation in green industries, and blocking the rise of giant tech monopolies would be vital to stronger growth in future. “I’m not welcoming the protectionist wave in the US, and that’s not good for world growth and innovation,” he said. Speaking as he accepted the prize, he said AI had “fantastic growth potential” but called on governments to develop strict competition policies to manage the growth of new tech companies. “Some superstar firms may end up dominating everything and inhibiting potential entry of new innovators. So how can we make sure that today’s innovators will not stifle future entry and innovation?” The prize committee said technological developments had helped to power sustained economic growth over the past two centuries, but warned that future gains could not be taken for granted. Mokyr, a Dutch-born American-Israeli economic historian, won the prize for his research identifying the prerequisites for sustained growth through technological progress. Aghion and Howitt, a Canadian economist, shared the award for their analysis of how “creative destruction” is key for driving growth. skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Business Today Get set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morning Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

85e6f525b63a,Family says failure to assess man’s mental health led to his death on Bibby Stockholm,,"The family of an asylum seeker who died on the Bibby Stockholm believe he would still be alive today had he been properly assessed and treated before being placed on the barge. Leonard Farruku, 27, died in the bathroom of his shared cabin onboard the barge on 12 December 2023. He had been moved there weeks earlier, after the then Conservative government began using the Bibby Stockholm to house asylum seekers. At an inquest in Bournemouth this month, the senior coroner Rachael Griffin concluded that he died as a result of suicide . Farruku’s sisters Marsida Keci and Jola Dushku said in a statement on Monday: “After listening to all the inquest evidence we firmly believe that Leonard was severely mentally unwell between July and December 2023 and in need of urgent assessment and treatment. “Instead of being helped by the English authorities, he was placed in the hostile and completely unsuitable environment of the barge. We believe that if Leonard had received proper assessment and treatment in August 2023, he would still be alive today. We miss him every day.” Farruku sought asylum in the UK in August 2022, and in March 2023 was placed in the Esplanade hotel in Paignton. Staff there raised the alarm because they were concerned he seemed mentally unwell. He had been referred to a local mental health service in Devon for an assessment of his mental state, scheduled for 12 August, but did not attend and the assessment was not rescheduled. The Home Office was alerted to concerns about his mental health but no assessment was conducted before he was moved to the barge. Between July and November 2023 Home Office contractors at the hotel submitted 11 incident reports about Farruku’s disturbed behaviour, at least three stating that staff believed him to have mental health problems. Ten of these reports were sent to the Home Office. Farruku’s sisters said although the coroner found “there was insufficient evidence” that Farruku was suffering from low mood or a mental disorder, which contributed to his decision to take his life, they believed there was evidence their brother was mentally unwell before he killed himself. “The hotel staff who saw Leonard every day knew that something was seriously wrong with his mental state,” they said. They added that Dr Dinesh Maganty, a consultant forensic psychiatrist who provided expert evidence to the inquest, concluded there was sufficient evidence that Farruku was likely to be suffering with a combination of a psychotic mental illness with an affective mood component. “It seems that everyone who had repeated contact with Leonard at that time knew that he was really unwell,” said Farruku’s sisters. On 3 November, the day Farruku was transferred to the barge, moored in Portland, Dorset , the local authority raised an urgent concern about the move on the basis of what they had been told about his mental health. This was relayed to the Home Office but officials took no action in response. The coroner identified this as a missed opportunity. Farruku’s sisters said: “We are shocked that when deciding whether it was safe to move Leonard to the barge, the Home Office did not look at their own safeguarding database, even after an email raising concerns about Leonard’s suitability from the local authority. It seems obvious to us that a man presenting the way he was should never have been placed on the barge.” Christina Bodénès, the solicitor for the family, said: “Leonard’s case is a tragic example of the dangers of the Home Office’s policy of placing vulnerable asylum seekers in unsuitable accommodation without having a proper system in place to assess their vulnerability and risk. “The Home Office had a wealth of information indicating that Leonard was seriously unwell at the time they made the decision to place him on the barge, but took none of this into account. “Given the current government’s commitment to expanding the use of large scale sites to accommodate asylum seekers, it is extremely concerning that the Home Office still refused to accept at Leonard’s inquest that they should have been concerned about Leonard’s mental health when he was transferred to the barge.” The Home Office has been approached for comment.",https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/oct/13/leonard-farruku-family-mental-health-bibby-stockholm,World,BBC,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f264aea0e2d4b90211420c447233ca4aeefcf671/112_0_522_418/master/522.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=18f90d91452c4d3b853c453056369753",2025-10-13T11:13:46+00:00,55dfb797c47d768f5f15df1979737cbddc338ad0
4879c3f17b8e,Tennessee community mourns 16 killed in munitions plant explosion,,"At least 200 mourners came to the Humphreys county courthouse at twilight on Sunday to mourn the 16 people killed in an explosion at a nearby munitions plant in middle Tennessee early on Friday. Humphreys county sheriff Chris Davis said that even in these nightmarish days, “the true strength of our county is our people”. “When tragedy hits, our people always come out,” he said through tears. He urged the local community to show up for their neighbors who lost friends and family members in the explosion that leveled a building at the Accurate Energetic Systems (AES) headquarters in nearby Bucksnort, Tennessee and flung debris two miles away. “Help fill the void of that lost loved one with your love,” he said. “Let’s take time to wrap our arms around these families.” Attendees passed a flame among white candlesticks until the courthouse lawn was filled with soft light. Musicians played Christian worship songs and classic hymns, and community members sang along softly. The Tennessee governor, Bill Lee, visited with families and flew over the site to survey the damage. “It’s kind of what Tennesseans do: they surround themselves in the times of greatest challenge,” Lee said. “The losses are staggering.” The cause of the explosion has not been identified, and authorities have not ruled out foul play. Authorities have not released the names of the victims, but they have spoken with the families of all 16 workers who are assumed deceased, and they have confirmed that the operation has shifted from rescue to recovery. Teams at the site are using rapid DNA technology in an effort to identify the remains of the dead. In a press conference Friday afternoon, a reporter asked Davis to describe the site. “Can I describe the building? There’s nothing to describe, it’s gone,” he said. “It’s the most devastating scene that I’ve seen in my career.” Some churches in the area cancelled their usual assemblies this morning, opting instead for intimate prayer services to lift up the victims and their families. One small church was full to standing room only. White folding chairs were brought out from the back to accommodate the overflow of guests. Chairs ringed the assistant preacher, full of red-eyed congregants. He stood before a simple altar that held a cross and two lit candlesticks. He didn’t use a microphone; he didn’t need one. The sanctuary was silent, except for the sounds of sniffles and the occasional broken sob. People passed around boxes of tissues and fussy babies, and held onto one another. A few people in blue shirts from Billy Graham Ministries were on hand for any mourners who wanted to talk or pray after the service. After the service, a man who knew one of the deceased said he had never been to the church before, but he thought it was usually a very small congregation. On Sunday morning, an estimated 150 to 200 people were in attendance. As congregants began to wander outside, volunteers folded the white chairs back up and carried them into the back room. Two women, weeping, hugged. “We’ll see him again someday,” one told the other.",https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/13/tennessee-munitions-plant-explosion,World,BBC,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1923e36236ff2fed38708adb0373c43a01d587ac/391_0_4605_3684/master/4605.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=1c93027811102b5c10545ef79b1515fd",2025-10-13T12:24:48+00:00,c435a6be0c9c4af15b0a82f6f85e971431c0f5c4
1fe97e9da6a0,"Microplastics are brought into the wilderness on hiking shoes and gear, study shows",,"Hiking shoes and outdoor gear are likely a significant source of microplastic pollution in the wilderness, new research that checked for the pernicious material in several Adirondack mountain lakes in upstate New York suggests. Researchers measured microplastic levels in two lakes that are the among highest sources of water for the Hudson River – one that sees heavy foot traffic from hikers, and another lake that is far away from a path and rarely touched by human activity. The samples from the lake that sees heavier foot traffic showed levels that were about 23 times higher. Soft-soled trail shoes and synthetic clothing “appear to be significant contributors to microplastics finding their way into these remote, otherwise pristine waters”, said Tim Keyes, a Sacred Heart University data scientist, who independently worked on the project with his company, Evergreen Business Analytics, and the Adirondack Hamlet to Huts non-profit. Microplastics are tiny bits of plastic either intentionally added to consumer goods, or which are products of larger plastics breaking down. The particles may contain any number of 16,000 plastic chemicals, of which many, such as BPA, phthalates and Pfas, present serious health risks . The substance has been found throughout the human body, and can cross the placental and brain barriers. Among other issues, microplastics are linked to chronic pulmonary inflammation, which can lead to lung cancer. Previous research found that as much as 70% of microplastics in ocean samples were from apparel. Meanwhile, the substance has been found in clouds and in precipitation samples. Keyes in 2023 sampled for microplastics in Lake Tear of the Clouds, which sits at about 4,300ft (1,300 meters). It sees heavy hiker traffic because it is adjacent to a trail segment that is part of several larger trails. Keyes sent the sample to an independent lab that found 9.45 particles per milliliter (mL). Because the area only had hiker traffic, “it was surmised that microplastic pollution was being brought to the area largely by airborne deposition”, the authors wrote, meaning primarily via precipitation. Now they suspect they were wrong. The authors returned two years later in early 2025 to sample Lake Tear, as well as Moss Pond, which the paper describes as “a remote, trailless body of water” at a similar elevation. The independent lab detected about 0.73 particles per mL in Moss Pond, and about 16.54 particles per mL in Lake Tear – a roughly 23-fold difference that suggests the hiker traffic is playing a major role. Lightweight trail shoes can shed microplastics similar to tires, which are another source of pollution, Keyes said. “It’s a pretty clear indication given the stark difference in microplastic levels between the sister body of water that’s a bushwack away compared to Lake Tear, which is on this thoroughfare for hikers that sees tens of thousands of people annually,” Keyes said. Sami Romanick, a microplastics researcher with the Environmental Working Group non-profit who was not involved with the study, said the research’s methodology and design were sound. She agreed with the conclusion that the contamination was likely caused by hiking gear. “It’s a reasonable explanation that’s supported by the data,” Romanick said. The authors say the findings are meant to generate awareness and underscore why industry should produce clothing and shoes that will shed fewer microplastics. Hikers should consider wearing hard-rubber-sole shoes that release less plastic compared with soft soles, and wear synthetic fiber clothing underneath those made with natural fibers.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/oct/13/microplastics-hiking-shoes-outdoor-gear,World,BBC,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/86871a9bd369158b9204b957f5b66e201777e5af/0_0_5414_4332/master/5414.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=9fa1487b2d601a110b523775f6e29f8d",2025-10-13T12:00:51+00:00,608e26145d85dac1fa86a93f377d4e7f33b94224
7471f2c4366f,Growing number of US veterans face arrest over Ice raid protests,,"US military veterans increasingly face arrest and injury amid protests over Donald Trump’s deportation campaign and his push to deploy national guard members to an ever-widening number of American cities. The Guardian has identified eight instances where military veterans have been prosecuted or sought damages after being detained by federal agents. The latest incident occurred in Broadview, outside Chicago, where 70-year old air force veteran Dana Briggs was charged with felony assault on a federal officer on 29 September. Dana Briggs. Photograph: Supplied to the Guardian A widely shared video on social media shows a masked US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) agent advance on and knock over the elderly veteran during a protest outside an Ice detention center. Federal prosecutors claim Briggs committed assault when he “made physical contact with an agent’s arm while the agent attempted to extend the safety perimeter”. Briggs pleaded not guilty and was released on an appearance bond. Jose Vasquez, a former US army staff sergeant and executive director of the progressive veterans’ organization Common Defense, which counts Briggs as a member, said veterans like Briggs “have stood up at Ice protests and faced arrest because we recognize a pattern of state-sanctioned abuse”. Another veteran, John Cerrone, was arrested while protesting outside the Broadview Ice detention the day before Briggs. A social media video shows a group of masked agents tackle the 35-year-old marine corps veteran, who served as a combat infantryman in Afghanistan, as teargas floats in the air. Cerrone says he was held for nine hours at the Broadview facility, alone in a cell with walls covered by blood, hair and mucus. He says that while he was behind bars he was visited by an Ice agent who boasted that he had shot Cerrone in the head with rubber bullets and exclaimed: “Where is that pussy!” John Cerrone in Afghanistan. Photograph: Supplied to the Guardian “Their conduct was completely unprofessional in my experience in combat infantry,” Cerrone said. “Even in Afghanistan, we had very clear rules of engagement. The conduct of these agents was such that if it occurred in Afghanistan, they would be removed from the front line. They would be court-martialed.” Cerrone was released after receiving a citation for “exhibiting disorderly conduct on federal property”, a misdemeanor under federal law, which he plans to contest. White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson told the Guardian: “Anyone who assaults or otherwise harms law enforcement officers will be held accountable to the fullest extent of the law.” Jackson added that “Ice officers are facing an 1,000% increase in assaults because of unhinged rhetoric from activists and Democrat politicians smearing heroic Ice officers.” Jackson and a Department of Homeland Security (DHS) spokesperson did not provide data to back up the claim about a 1,000% increase. In a brief reply to questions from the Guardian, a Department of Justice spokesperson said: “Under this Administration, we follow the law and have a one-tier system of justice, and this Department of Justice will relentlessly uphold the rule of law to protect our nation.” “What drives so many veterans into action is not only the injustice faced by immigrants and protesters, but also the larger threat to democracy rooted in government brutality and militarization,” Vasquez, the Common Defense leader, said. “The disturbing escalation in arrests and violence signals that the basic freedoms we once swore to protect are under attack.” Not all of the veterans discussed in this story indicated their military service at the time of the incidents or their arrests. On Thursday, the US district judge Sara Ellis issued a temporary restraining order restricting federal agents from “using riot control weapons” against journalists, protesters and religious practitioners in Chicago unless there is probable cause that the individuals have committed a crime. In a statement in the wake of Briggs’s arrest, Demi Palecek – an Illinois army national guard member who is running as a Democrat for a state legislative seat in Chicago – criticized Ice agents for their lack of training. “As a military member, I can tell you – the way they handle weapons is reckless and dangerous,” she said. “I’ve seen Ice agents with their fingers on the trigger of real M16s, pointing M9s directly at people. Trigger-happy. No trigger discipline… with this level of escalation and incompetence, people will die.” An DHS spokesperson countered that “Ice and other federal law enforcement are using proper force with professional training to protect the public as well as federal buildings from violent Antifa-aligned terrorists.” Those arrested assaulted Ice officers, the spokesperson said. Veterans have also protested Ice’s use of a Chicago area VA hospital’s parking lot as a staging ground for immigration raids. Senator Tammy Duckworth – a former US army helicopter pilot who lost the use of both legs when she was shot down over Iraq – offered her support to demonstrators on 17 September, demanding that secretary of veterans affairs, Doug Collins, evict agents from the Edward Hines Jr VA Hospital. “It adds injury to insult when VA surrenders resources in support of reckless, paramilitary activities that do nothing to enhance Veteran care – and even worse, are actively harming Veterans and US servicemembers by rounding up these patriotic Americans, along with their family members, and deporting them with little or no due process out of the country they were willing to risk their lives to defend,” she wrote. “We have veterans who are staying away and not getting healthcare or coming in carrying their passports,” said Aaron Hughes, an Iraq war veteran and former Illinois national guardsman, who is a member of the anti-war veterans group, About Face, which organized the protest. Nicholas Podjasek, a 34 year-old US air force veteran born in Honduras, told the Guardian he cancelled a primary care appointment at the Hines VA which had been scheduled for Thursday. Though Podjasek, like nearly all veterans is a US citizen, he said many are nonetheless worried about being detained by Ice “because we are brown”, citing a Trump administration policy that legalized racial profiling in immigration enforcement. “These people are masking themselves and they zip tie children,” he said. “They’ve broken into people’s homes and apartments. They could easily detain me on public transportation on the way to the VA or right outside the gate.” In an email to the Guardian, VA press secretary Peter Kasperowicz denied such fear exists. Kasperowicz said the VA was “proud to support its federal partners in the fight against illegal immigration” and that there “has been no impact on veteran care or facility access” from Ice agents’ use of the Hines VA parking lot. Veteran Daryn Hertzberg II tackled by federal agents at Ice protest in Oregon on 13 August – video In Portland, Oregon, US marine corps veteran Daryn Herzberg II, who served in Afghanistan, is seeking $150,000 in damages after he was hospitalized after being tackled from behind by Ice agents while protesting outside a federal facility in Portland on 13 August. A video posted on social media shows an agent grabbing Herzberg by the hair and slamming his face into the ground multiple times while saying, “You’re not talking shit anymore are you?” according to a Federal Tort Claims Act complaint filed by his attorney. A DHS spokesperson countered that the former marine corps sergeant, who was honorably discharged in 2012, “is well known for acts of violence outside the Ice facility in Portland, including throwing rocks and other objects at the building and personnel.” The spokesperson also said Herzberg has “used fake blood to falsify injuries” and “perpetuated and encouraged violence” against Ice. Daryn Herzberg. Photograph: Supplied to the Guardian Herzberg has not been charged with a crime. His attorney, Michael Fuller, denied the spokesperson’s assertions and said “the Ice assault video speaks for itself.” “The fact that DHS won’t attribute its slander of a US marine to an actual witness speaks to the baseless nature of its allegations,” the attorney said. As previously reported by the Guardian, Afghanistan war veteran Bajun Mavalwalla II faces federal conspiracy charges after participating in a 11 June protest that sought to block the transport of two Venezuelan migrants who were in the country legally seeking asylum when they were detained by Ice. In Washington DC, attorney general Pam Bondi announced on 14 August that she was charging Afghanistan war veteran Sean Charles Dunn with felony assault after he allegedly threw a sandwich at a Customs and Border Patrol agent. However, prosecutors were unable to secure an indictment from a grand jury. Other notable veterans arrested, include: Iraq war veteran and US citizen George Retes, 25, was arrested on 10 July by Ice during a raid on a cannabis farm in Ventura county, California where he worked as a security guard. He was held in federal custody for three days. Retes is seeking damages under the Federal Tort Claims Act, alleging wrongful arrest. In an op-ed in the San Francisco Chronicle, he wrote : “If it can happen to me, it can happen to any one of us.” In a social media post on X, the Department of Homeland Security alleged he was arrested for assault. As of this writing, no charges have been filed. A DHS spokesperson told the Guardian that the justice department was reviewing the case, “along with dozens of others, for potential charges related to the execution of the federal search warrant in Camarillo”. On 25 August , 20-year army combat veteran Jay Carey – who served in Iraq, Bosnia and Afghanistan – was arrested and faces two federal misdemeanor charges after burning a flag in front of the White House. Carey, from western North Carolina, was part of a small group of veterans who came to Washington to protest the national guard’s deployment to that city. On 13 June , an 87-year-old disabled veteran in a walker was arrested after he traveled from an assisted living facility in Florida to protest Donald Trump’s military parade. John Spitzberg, whose service spanned the army, air force and air national guard, was among dozens of veterans arrested for protesting what they said was the politicization of the armed forces and Trump’s authoritarian instincts.

2079fa1f7592,Can Colombia embrace clean energy without damaging the Amazon?,,"A s the sun sets over the Colombian Amazon, construction worker Pablo Portillo observes the canopy. Titi monkeys swing in the treetops as the Mocoa River roars nearby. For four years, he and his family have lived quietly in this biodiverse “gateway to the Amazon”, where the Andes descend into the rainforest, home to mountain tapirs, spectacled bears and vital rivers. But Portillo, 46, fears this peaceful landscape is at risk. Canadian company Copper Giant Resources has been exploring nearby mountains with a view to opening one of Colombia ’s largest copper mines. Beneath Mocoa lie an estimated 2m tonnes of copper , a transition metal vital for clean energy in wind turbines and batteries. Copper Giant holds four permits for the exploration and possible development of copper and molybdenum, and has expanded its land in Mocoa to more than 136,000 hectares (337,000 acres) by acquiring Grupo Minera Sol in June, a Colombian company that holds 12 mining applications covering 53,474 hectares (132,000 acres). A looping video of scenery of mountains and the town of Mocoa Mocoa is called the ‘gateway to the Amazon’ due to its location at the edge of the rainforest “We’re surrounded by nature and the air you breathe is pure,” says Portillo. “What we fear is that all of this would be destroyed, completely finished.” As the world strives toward a carbon-free future, demand for copper has soared. According to the International Energy Agency (IEA) thinktank, copper prices reached a high of $10,800 (£8,000) a tonne last year , while demand is projected to grow by 30% by 2040. We’re surrounded by nature and the air you breathe is pure. What we fear is that all of this would be destroyed Pablo Portillo, construction worker Supplies have not kept pace, with the IEA predicting a 30% shortfall by 2035, and Colombia’s leftwing president, Gustavo Petro, has prioritised securing minerals crucial to the energy transition, including copper. But critics say the push to extract copper in Mocoa risks undermining another of Petro’s promises: preserving the Amazon. Mocoa sits along the Cauca metallogenic belt, a stretch of the Andes known to be rich with minerals, and at the edge of the Amazon rainforest . Efforts to develop a mine in the area have long faced resistance from local people, who believe that such a project would cause irreversible damage to the fragile ecosystems and pollute the waters on which they rely. In March, residents of Pueblo Viejo, near the exploration area, protested over a road to the site. What started as demands for Copper Giant to fix the road turned into a 47-day blockade, demanding that the government stop mining.

Signs reading “water is more valuable than copper” and “land, water and life are non-negotiable” are on display. “We’re speaking out because we want people to realise we can protect mountains and countryside before it’s too late,” Portillo says. In May, CorpoAmazonia , the regional environmental authority, and the environment ministry reached a deal with protesters to review the viability of the mining project. By early June, the authority issued a resolution designating 93,000 hectares (230,000 acres), including land within the mining concessions, as an “area of ecological importance”, where mining activities would be restricted. Although the resolution is non-binding, it has increased pressure on the national government. “What we want to avoid is the displacement and extinction of flora and fauna species and also to avoid the contamination of water sources,” says a CorpoAmazonia official, speaking anonymously as they were not authorised to comment publicly.

He also warned that the use of explosives and heavy metals in copper extraction endangers the integrity of the protected area and other fragile ecosystems, such as the water-generating páramos (tropical Andean wetland grassland ecosystems), that are located within the mining concessions. C opper Giant says the project in Colombia is still in the early stages of exploration, a phase that could last another eight to 10 years, and that it is too early to determine the environmental impacts of copper mining in the area. “We don’t even have a design for the mine yet,” says Thyana Álvarez, Copper Giant country manager. Álvarez adds that last year, the company requested that Colombia’s National Mining Agency excluded the forest reserve areas from its mining concessions. “We are awaiting the new concession contracts with these removals,” she says. Still, the dispute in Mocoa has highlighted tensions within Petro’s environmental agenda. In 2023, the president announced a shift away from oil and gas exploration and ordered the exploration of energy transition materials. That same year, his administration classified 17 minerals, copper among them , as “strategic” for their role in the country’s energy transition. “I have asked the energy minister to focus mining exploration on fundamental raw materials so that Colombia can become an enormous generator of clean energy,” Petro said in 2023 . But critics have said the rush to extract minerals critical to the energy transition could come at the cost of the Amazon rainforest, considered a vital carbon sink essential for the fight against the climate emergency. About 40% of Colombia’s territory is part of the Amazon region. A sign reads ‘Land, water and life are non-negotiable’ in Pueblo Viejo, where people have established a resistance camp. Photograph: Christina Noriega/The Guardian José Luis López, a researcher at the National University’s Observatory of Environmental Conflict in Bogotá , says Colombia’s climate crisis strategy would be more effective if it focused on “conserving biodiversity and halting forest degradation” rather than expanding mining. In May, the environment minister, Lena Estrada, publicly addressed the protests in Mocoa, noting that the ministry is reviewing local calls for stricter protection. “They’re asking for environmental zoning of those territories,” she said. “We’re going to review this possibility. We’re going to make the province of Putumayo [where Mocoa is located], like all the other Amazonian provinces, protected areas.” The national mining agency did not respond to a request for comment. In Pueblo Viejo, Portillo and others remain suspicious and continue to voice their opposition. They hold resistance camp meetings and have launched a campaign to create awareness among the surrounding communities about the impact a mine could have. Portillo says that he will continue until Copper Giant leaves their territory. “We refuse,” he says, “to be sacrificed for the energy transition.” A saddleback tamarin, one of many species found in the biodiverse region.

74893538b941,Greenpeace threatens to sue crown estate for driving up cost of offshore wind,,"Greenpeace is threatening to sue King Charles’s property management company, accusing it of exploiting its monopoly ownership of the seabed. The environmental lobby group alleges the crown estate has driven up costs for wind power developers and boosted its own profits, as well as the royal household’s income, due to the “aggressive” way it auctions seabed rights. The crown estate, as the legal owner of the seabed around England, Wales and Northern Ireland, is responsible for auctioning offshore wind rights. It has benefited from the huge growth in the industry, commanding hefty option fees from renewable energy developers to secure areas of the seabed to build their windfarms. It made a £1.1bn profit in its financial year ended in March , double its level just two years ago. Will McCallum, co-executive director at Greenpeace UK, said the estate should be “managing the seabed in the interest of the nation and the common good, not as an asset to be milked for profit and outrageous bonuses”. “We should leave no stone unturned in looking for solutions to lower energy bills that are causing misery to millions of households,” he said. “Given how crucial affordable bills and clean energy are to the government’s agenda, the chancellor should use her powers of direction to ask for an independent review of how these auctions are run. If the problem isn’t fixed before the next round, we may need to let a court decide whether or not what’s happening is lawful.” Greenpeace argues the crown estate has a legal duty not to exploit its monopoly position as owner of the seabed around England, Wales and Northern Ireland, but that it is now in breach of this. The lobby group said it was concerned the crown estate was rationing supply of the seabed to protect high prices, and argued this could harm the development of offshore wind power in the UK. The crown estate has reportedly rejected Greenpeace’s claims, arguing the lobby group has misinterpreted the estate’s legal duties. About 12% of crown estate profits flow to the monarchy to fund its work. This was lowered from 25% in 2023 to offset the rise in profits from offshore wind projects. The UK’s wind industry is at a critical juncture as the government plans to double onshore wind and quadruple offshore wind power capacity by the end of the decade. The crown estate, which also includes a portfolio of London properties and rural real estate, is worth £15bn. The property assets in London, which is concentrated around Regent Street and St James’s, are valued at £7.1bn. A spokesperson for the crown estate said: “Greenpeace has misunderstood the crown estate’s legal duties and leasing processes. Option fees are not fixed by the crown estate. They are set by the developers through open, competitive auctions and reflect market appetite at the time. As our net revenue is returned to the Treasury, option fees help to ensure that taxpayers benefit from the requisite value from the development of our scarce and precious seabed resource. “The crown estate is accelerating offshore wind in line with government policy to move forward the energy transition at pace and improve energy security.” The Treasury was approached for comment.",https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/oct/13/greenpeace-threatens-to-sue-crown-estate-for-driving-up-cost-of-offshore-wind,World,BBC,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9e39900a5fcd887d3781c5164c5dbb2a87d64232/615_0_4213_3371/master/4213.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=9cb8108975fe05d6ebd197326078fe2f",2025-10-13T13:24:42+00:00,0ee728358c0cb8c7796d0dfb33cea8b8672cee01
bc21ff826c17,Why has the US-China trade war restarted and how have markets reacted?,,"With nearly a month to go before the deadline for the US and China to reach a deal in their trade war, goodwill between the two countries appears to have been swept off the table in recent days. China announced that it was once again restricting the export of critical minerals , prompting the US president, Donald Trump, to announce tariffs of 100% on US-bound Chinese exports, scuppering, at least for now, hopes that global economic chaos could be averted. Why has the US-China trade war re started? On Thursday, China’s commerce ministry announced enhanced restrictions on the export of rare earths , citing national security concerns. China’s chokehold on the global supply chain of rare earths – minerals found in the Earth’s crust that are used to make everything from consumer electronics to cars to military equipment – has been a sticking point in the trade war. China produces more than 90% of the world’s processed rare earths and controls about 70% of the world’s mining . Trump responded by calling China’s decision “extremely hostile” and announcing across the board tariffs of 100% on Chinese imports. There had previously been a pause on the US-China tariffs until 10 November, when the two sides were due to agree a deal. China’s rare earths announcement did not come out of the blue. Last month, the US announced enhanced controls on the export of chipmaking equipment to China, aimed at closing perceived loopholes in Washington’s plans to deprive China of advanced semiconductors. This is not the first time that Beijing has exploited its control of rare earths. In April, exports were restricted, causing manufacturing slowdowns around the world. It temporarily lifted those restrictions a few months later. “Beijing is effectively reactivating its April playbook – escalating first to force a negotiation reset, rather than waiting passively for the next talks,” said Hutong Research, an independent advisory firm based in Beijing and Shanghai. What progress had been made in recent months? The return of hostilities comes after there had been some signs of thawing on both sides. In September, the US and China reached a deal on TikTok , the Chinese-owned social media app that faced being banned in the US if its parent company, Bytedance, did not divest. After talks in Madrid, Beijing and Washington agreed to a deal in which the platform would switch to US-controlled ownership. China called the agreement a “win-win”. Trump and Xi Jinping, China’s president, spoke on the phone that week to confirm the deal. News of the deal was followed by a group of US lawmakers visiting China for the first time since 2019. They met China’s premier, Li Qiang, and talked of the need to “break the ice”. But it has not all been plain sailing. As well as disagreements over access to chipmaking equipment, the US and China have been at loggerheads over China’s purchases of Russian oil and declining soybean exports from the US to China. Since Trump’s first trade war in 2018, China has reduced its reliance on the US for key commodities . Will Trump and Xi meet to negotiate a new deal? Trump and Xi were expected to meet at the Apec summit in South Korea, which starts at the end of this month. There was also talk of Trump visiting Beijing in January. Both those meetings seem less likely now. “I was to meet President Xi in two weeks, at Apec, in South Korea, but now there seems to be no reason to do so,” Trump wrote on the social media platform Truth Social on Friday. How have the markets reacted? US markets reacted negatively to the news. The S&P 500 Index slid by more than 2% following Trump’s announcement about the 100% tariffs, the biggest one-day fall since April. Some analysts speculated that the stockmarkets could put pressure on Trump to walk back the latest levies. On Sunday, he appeared to soften his tone towards Xi, writing on Truth Social that “it will all be fine” and that “The USA wants to help China, not hurt it!!!” European markets rebounded slightly on the news. But all eyes will now be on Beijing to see if it imposes counter-tariffs. On Sunday, the commerce ministry said China would pursue “resolute measures to protect its legitimate rights and interests”. China may also renege on the TikTok deal, which could do more political damage than tit-for-tat tariffs.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/oct/13/why-us-china-trade-war-restarted-tariffs,Business,BBC,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5722ab6c61c26af7f05210e2dde2015692a440ed/452_0_2494_1995/master/2494.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=e9e5080ff237dce1501c365cc2250d69",2025-10-13T13:17:02+00:00,897aacf62580dafdcfac4c7c3945921933dd6a5d

46fec95d480a,Families of David Amess and Jo Cox voice concern at rise in violent political rhetoric,,"The families of the murdered MPs David Amess and Jo Cox have voiced concern about a recent surge in violent political rhetoric in Britain. While the fatal attack on a synagogue in Manchester and targeting of Muslims have placed a renewed spotlight on violent antisemitism and Islamophobia, there are also concerns over an increasing normalisation of language calling for political figures to be killed. Examples include the suspension of a Reform UK councillor linked to a social media account calling for Keir Starmer to be shot and the arrest of a man allegedly captured on film at major far-right rally last month in London threatening to kill the prime minister. At the same rally, Elon Musk made comments that later drew condemnation from Downing Street when he told the crowd that “violence is coming” . The language comes after a summer of anti-immigration protests, culture war flashpoints and a surge in podcasts and YouTube videos predicting civil war. Speaking ahead of the fourth anniversary of her father’s death this week, Katie Amess said the murder of the rightwing activist Charlie Kirk had been a triggering moment for her family but should also come as a wake-up call in the UK. “My father was someone who had just as many friends in the Labour party as in the Conservative party and worked with people from all sides, so he would be horrified at the insidious way in which dehumanising language has increasingly crept into social media,” she said. “To hear of the kinds of things that are being said and the explicit threats that are being made about political figures – including the prime minister – is deeply shocking. “We can’t bring my father back, but we can surely learn lessons and realise that it is time to dial down the temperature of what is being said both online and offline.” Brendan Cox, who was married to Jo Cox when she was shot and stabbed by a far-right extremist during the EU referendum campaign in 2016, warned high levels of polarisation and division in Britain were making violence more likely. “In the US, our nearest cultural neighbour, there is a zeitgeist of renewed political violence. We had hoped that what happened after the deaths of Jo and David, when everyone drew breath, would happen after the death of Charlie Kirk. Instead, what has happened in the US is being used as another way of stoking political division,” he said. Those on Britain’s right are also expressing concern about their safety. Nigel Farage accused Keir Starmer of inciting violence against Reform UK members by levelling accusations of racism at the party. “This language will incite and encourage the radical left,” said Farage, who has called on the police to act against TikTok users who he said had called for him to be shot. However, while the police have been quick to act in some cases, there is also concern over an apparent inconsistent approach between forces. Another stark example of the language being directed at Starmer includes footage seen by the Guardian of a far-right activist involved in protests against asylum seekers in Leicestershire calling for him to be killed on the day of the London rally. “I don’t care if I get shut down for it … I would love to see Keir Starmer get shot dead outside No 10 Downing Street … bam … straight in his head … boom … gone,” Chris Boyall told the 21,000 subscribers to his England Till I Die YouTube channel days before travelling to London. “Fucking too right … on the 13th of September it would be the perfect day for it, wouldn’t it? Shoot him fucking dead.” Leicestershire police said they were aware of the video, adding it had been reviewed thoroughly but “at this time, no criminal offence has been identified”. “We recognise the importance of balancing freedom of expression with the need to protect individuals and communities from harm,” a spokesperson said. The response was questioned by Stand Up to Racism, which highlighted the footage. “He called for the assassination of the prime minister, specified the method and said it should be done on a day he would presumably be outside the residence of the prime minister.” Cox suggested that incitement to violence may not be taken seriously by some forces who were under pressure for arresting people over non-crime hate incidents. “We don’t, and have never had, an interpretation of free speech which means you can incite violence,” he said. Concern that the acceptability of using violence could rise if those threatening it were not prosecuted was voiced by Jonathan Hall KC, the independent reviewer of terrorism legislation “It’s true that counter-terrorism police will point to all their other priorities, and sometimes local policing may be enough,” he told the Guardian, adding that terrorist powers would sometimes be needed for cases of politically motivated attacks or violent threats against elected politicians. “Unless perpetrators are caught and prosecuted, there is insufficient deterrent. The acceptability of using violence to attack democratic institutions will creep up without a more consistent response.”",https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/oct/13/families-david-amess-jo-cox-voice-concern-rise-violent-political-rhetoric,politics,BBC,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cf8608748b143070a8bee80415eb706938d93bf2/233_0_5000_4000/master/5000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=5c92cc0751bad6991020a7acae09e16e",2025-10-13T14:00:02+00:00,c9d42267dc56caa395a934f4160ce985575ae35f
3a30a4655b7b,The Conservative party’s obsession with Margaret Thatcher merch feels less kitsch and more cult,,"O n this fateful day, when Margaret Thatcher would have been 100 years old, many are taking a moment to replay their favourite memories: that time when she said there was no such thing as society; that time when she snatched milk from primary-schoolchildren; that amazing pro-EU jumper she had; all those times when she wasn’t for turning. It’s one of those days when you’re supposed to stick to the stuff we can all agree on, such as: whatever you think of her policies, she was a one-off. You didn’t get many Margaret Thatchers to the yard. No amount of positivity, however, can paper over the alarming gulf in Thatcher-appreciation between regular people and members of the Conservative party. Last week, I went to the opening of The Iron Lady: The Legacy Paintings, an exhibition by the artist Lorna May Wadsworth, who, although I don’t know her, I’m medium sure is not a Thatcher superfan. She was the last artist to paint Thatcher before she died, but she has also painted Tony Blair, David Blunkett and Rowan Williams. She’s a portraitist. They rise above petty stuff like “what people said” and “what people did”, the better to immortalise them. The Tory faithful, however, love these Iron Lady paintings to a hair-raising degree. Another of Wadsworth’s fetched £400,000 in 2014. It’s 6ft square, and hangs in Conservative Campaign Headquarters, bearing down on the party with memories of past glories, like a gigantic rebuke. These smaller (let’s call them normal-sized) ones are essentially the same image with Warholian variations – a gold background, a blue one, an iron one; it’s surprising how many colours are quintessentially Thatcherite for those who really, really love her – and the iconography comes to feel much bigger than politics, more like a faith. At the Conservative conference this year, meanwhile, Thatcher references had gone from memorabilia to shrine. There were cardboard cutouts, because there always are, and cheeky, kitsch gift mugs. Delegates were invited to have their photos taken to make a Thatcher mosaic, to be projected on to a wall – you have to admit, it’s a fascinating solution to the question, “How can we make everyone here feel as though they’re a living, breathing part of a project that died 35 years ago?” But you also have to admit what an astronomically weird question that is. There were genuine Thatcher outfits in glass cases – dry-cleaned, of course, but that couldn’t wash away the crispy, faded, slightly eerie look, more Miss Havisham than V&A museum. The lady’s not for tippling … limited edition Scotch whisky and a Margaret Thatcher-themed Toby jug on sale at the party conference. Photograph: Oli Scarff/AFP/Getty Images Thatcher passion among Tories was well in evidence three years ago, during the leadership contest, but its nature was different. Kemi Badenoch was trying to channel Thatcher-the-chemist by going on about her engineering credentials. Penny Mordaunt was deploying that soft, low voice – Thatcher famously took months of coaching, to rid herself of any modulation that people might find shrill – as well as making assertively witless anti-trans jokes: “I think it was Margaret Thatcher that said every prime minister needs a Willie; a woman like me doesn’t have one.” Liz Truss stole the show by simply dressing up as Thatcher, recreating her signature looks, pussy-bow collars and fur hats, in a fancy-dress pitch to people who weren’t concentrating at all (Truss was nothing like Thatcher, politically), but wanted to feel the same feels as they felt in 1979. It was powerfully reminiscent of Ferdinand “Bongbong” Marcos , sweeping to presidential victory in the Philippines that same year by blaring out the same campaign songs as his father, Ferdinand Sr, had used 40 years earlier. Somehow, voters didn’t think, “Wait a second, isn’t this the son of that utterly corrupt guy whose wife had all those shoes?”; they thought, “Ah, I remember this tune, makes me feel young again.” In 2022, talking constantly about Margaret Thatcher made Tory members feel young again. Three years on, the Conservatives’ Thatcher obsession feels more devotional than nostalgic, more cultish than escapist. And while none of us, least of all me, can speak for the Iron Lady’s heart, we all know she was quite a pragmatic person; I cannot believe this is what she would have wanted.",https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/oct/13/conservative-party-obsession-margaret-thatcher-merch-less-kitsch-more-cult,politics,BBC,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cc779a1b176b3baa3615d1bddd8835f3f376c415/916_228_6567_5254/master/6567.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=57ad7934b476ebf6342de7dc89e58f72",2025-10-13T14:31:23+00:00,9dbc33cff22e961b0ce54f066a53bc100520dd79
c2e2d59a5ae6,Here’s what you need to know about Starmer’s illiberal protest curbs: they would have killed the Labour party at birth,,"I magine a movement arising in this country that seeks to overthrow established power. Imagine that it begins with a series of rebellions, in Scotland and south Wales perhaps, that shut down workplaces, confront police and soldiers (sometimes peaceably, sometimes with crude weapons), set up roadblocks and lay siege to the places where fellow protesters are imprisoned and government officials are meeting. Imagine that this movement goes on to smash or disable machinery across the country. Imagine that it organises a general strike, nixing much of the UK’s economic activity for three months. Imagine that it keeps protesting in the same places by the same means, gradually eroding the resistance of the state. Keir Starmer’s Labour government would doubtless do everything in its power not just to stop these individual actions but to prohibit the movement. What am I describing? The origins and development of the Labour party. The Labour party arose from a long wave of protests by workers against capital, calling for workers’ rights and for sweeping democratic reforms. These protests and their organisers came to be known as the labour movement. Its early actions included the radical war in Scotland , the Merthyr and Newport risings in south Wales, the Swing riots in England and the General Strike of 1842 . No such protests would have meant no such movement. No such movement would have meant no such party. Yet somehow, the party that arose from protest has formed, in terms of our rights to free expression and democratic challenge, the most illiberal government the UK has suffered since the second word war. This Labour government would have banned the labour movement. Over 40 years, starting with the Public Order Act 1986, our rights to assemble and challenge power have been severely curtailed. That act was followed by the Trade Union Act 1992 , the Criminal Justice Act 1994, the Terrorism Act 2000, the Serious Organised Crime and Police Act 2005 , the Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Act 2022 and the Public Order Act 2023 . Between them, they have largely bound and gagged effective protest . Any government that fails to contest and reverse this trend, even if it did nothing to add to this bleak legacy, sides with illiberalism. Far from doing so, Starmer’s has already gone further than the Conservatives dared, by classifying a civil disobedience group – Palestine Action – as a terrorist organisation and banning it. It has also (so far with remarkably little resistance) inserted a clause into its crime and policing bill enabling the police to stop demonstrations “in the vicinity of a place of worship”. As our towns and cities are so richly endowed with religious buildings, that means almost any urban area. But its latest proposal is even worse. The home secretary, Shabana Mahmood, has announced that the police should be able to stop protests that have a “cumulative impact”, by recurring in the same place. She will also consider “powers to ban protests outright”. Mahmood has sought to justify these measures with the claim that repeated protests can leave religious groups, especially the Jewish community, feeling unsafe. It is worth noting that a Conservative home secretary, Suella Braverman, forced a very similar measure through parliament in 2023 (which was later struck down by the courts) using an entirely different argument : that repeated environmental protests were causing disruption to businesses and travellers. Illiberal people seek to stop protest. They will seize on any argument that justifies this urge. It is essential that Jews in Britain are fiercely protected against antisemitic hate and antisemitic attacks. We must be perpetually vigilant against anyone who uses the Israeli government’s genocide in Gaza as an excuse for antisemitism. This hate crime must be prosecuted, wherever it arises. But linking this disgusting crime to the act of protesting against the genocide, however peacefully and respectfully, as the government has explicitly done , triggers two grim thoughts. The first is that it is using the horrific terrorism in Manchester last week as a good moment for shutting down dissent. The second is that it treats protests against Israeli government actions as protests against the Jewish community in Britain. Otherwise, it’s hard to understand why Mahmood and the prime minister should have called for only one thing to be cancelled the following day to respect the grief of British Jews: not football matches, concerts, car boot sales and protests, but solely the silent and peaceful Palestine protest in London. Jewish people in this country have repeatedly warned against such conflations , which can themselves constitute antisemitism. Mahmood’s proposals, as well as being profoundly illiberal in their own right, add a new storey to the tower of authoritarian measures in whose shadow we live. We suffer the “cumulative impact” of a long succession of anti-protest laws. Labour is waging a concerted attack on the thing that made it. skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Matters of Opinion Guardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and more Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

First-past-the-post elections delivering a massive majority on 34% of the vote? One second’s participation in decision-making every five years? Presumed consent in between? Governments claiming to represent us, but responding instead to press barons and corporations? Politics on sale to the highest bidder, through political donations and paid lobbying? This is democracy? This is a system that requires no challenge? Those who opposed the labour movement two centuries ago also believed their political system was unimprovable. In 1830, when a tiny minority was allowed to vote and entire cities were unrepresented, the prime minister, the Duke of Wellington, told parliament that neither he nor the leader of the opposition could see any means by which “the state of the representation could be improved”. The existing system deservedly “possessed the full and entire confidence of the country”. Our political ancestors knew that to be effective you have to keep coming back. You have to turn up where it counts. You have to make a nuisance of yourself. You must be noisy, obstructive, annoying. One by one, all these rights have been struck down. Now the last remaining attribute of effective dissent – persistence – is also to be banned. Protest is allowed, as long as it’s invisible, transient and useless. But the moment protest ceases to be effective is the moment democracy dies.",https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/oct/13/keir-starmer-protest-labour-rights-uk,politics,BBC,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/264966947f4129ec5196e676566fda23b7cc5a4b/0_0_4536_3628/master/4536.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=8d961456f31bad957678cb9d87c854bf",2025-10-13T14:23:06+00:00,9586b606a413ee57990c64724441a935ab97d880
9989499545e4,Madagascar president flees after losing support of key army unit,,"Madagascar’s president, Andry Rajoelina, is reported to have fled the country on a French military aircraft, hours before he was scheduled to address the people. French state radio RFI reported on Monday that the president, who also has French citizenship, had been flown out of the capital, Antananarivo, after a deal with President Emmanuel Macron. It added that he may have headed for Dubai. He had been due to speak to the nation at 7pm (1600 GMT), according to a statement from the presidency on Facebook. Rajoelina, 51, was first president from 2009 to 2014 before returning to power in 2023 . He was increasingly isolated after losing the support of a key army unit that joined thousands of youths activists known as “Gen Z Madagascar” to protest against corruption and poverty. The movement had earlier turned down an invitation to meet him for dialogue and demanded his resignation. People flooded a square in front of the Antananarivo city hall on Monday, waving flags and chanting slogans, some hanging off military vehicles as they arrived, according to Agence France-Presse reporters. Among the demonstrators were soldiers from the elite Capsat unit, which played a major role in the 2009 coup during Rajoelina’s rise to the presidency after mass protests forced his predecessor Marc Ravalomanana out of power. Also present were gendarmerie officers, accused of using heavy-handed tactics during the near-daily protests over more than two weeks. They admitted in a video statement to “faults and excesses” in their response. At least 22 people were killed in the first days by security forces and others in violence sparked by criminal gangs and looters, according to the UN. But Rajoelina had disputed the toll, saying last week there were “12 confirmed deaths and all of these individuals were looters and vandals”. On Saturday, some Capsat soldiers had posted a video to social media saying: “Let us join forces, military, gendarmes and police, and refuse to be paid to shoot our friends, our brothers and our sisters.” “Close the gates, and await our instructions,” they added. “Do not obey orders from your superiors. Point your weapons at those who order you to fire on your comrades in arms because they will not take care of our families if we die.” The showdown began following the arrest of two politicians on 19 September after planning a protest against the country’s chronic power and water outages.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/oct/13/madagascar-president-andry-rajoelina-flees-country-capsat,World,BBC,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6440f9a7c14ad8d261dc00108ddf2d5138d38ab8/449_0_4371_3497/master/4371.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=6d996056061dee25226b9305d7cc807b",2025-10-13T14:57:25+00:00,b1449f97e349f84b85501a53418acebc347203e1

The flooding, caused by intense rainfall, was focused mostly in the Veracruz, Hidalgo and Puebla states, said Laura Velázquez, the head of Mexico’s civil defense authorities. The toll rose by 17 from just 12 hours earlier, indicating the still unfolding scale of the disaster. The floods sent overflowing rivers through entire villages, triggered landslides and swept away roads and bridges. President Claudia Sheinbaum said that thousands of troops as well as boats, planes and helicopters had been deployed to assist the rescue efforts.

f5e07b4bf840,"Up to 300,000 Australians will be on aged care waitlist by 2030 under new changes, modelling shows",,"As many as 300,000 elderly Australians will be on the waitlist for assistance at home by 2030, according to new expert modelling of Australia’s redesigned aged care system . Kathy Eagar, a former adviser to the aged care royal commission and a UNSW adjunct professor, has forecast demand for in-home packages under Labor’s changes to the national aged care system, now due to come into force from 1 November. Using Australian Bureau of Statistics population data and waitlist projections, Eager finds a shortfall of more than 171,000 places by June next year – unmet demand of 31%. The waitlist, which grows each year by about 30,000 places, is forecast to reach more than 301,000 by June 2030, representing a shortfall of 44%. Figures included in the 2025-26 federal budget papers show a 27% increase in residential aged care spending and just a 0.3% increase in new support at home packages over the four-year forward estimates period. Separately, documents tabled in Senate estimates hearings last week show that at the end of September nearly 122,000 people on the national priority system were waiting for a home care package. Sign up: AU Breaking News email The figure has risen from from 96,709 at the end of June this year. Eagar said the new system – originally expected to come into force from 1 July this year but delayed to give the sector more time for implementation – faced a rough start. “The 2025-26 budget has no growth beyond 30 June 2026 for Support at Home, the waiting list has increased 26% in just three months, around 10% of all public hospital beds across Australia are now occupied by patients awaiting aged care placement and the government doesn’t seem to even recognise that there’s a problem,” she said. She has joined groups, including community organisation Meals on Wheels, in calling on the government to maintain the existing Commonwealth Home Support program, set to be rolled into the new system. It provides entry-level care for seniors at home. The Greens aged care spokesperson, Penny Allman-Payne, said Labor had not released enough new home care packages, warning elderly people would continue to die while waiting for assessments and care packages to begin. “It takes over six months, in many cases, for people just to get an assessment, to get care, and then when they finally do get assessed and they think that they’re at the point where they’re going to get the help that they need,” she told Guardian Australia. “Then they can be waiting up to 12 months and sometimes even 18 months then to actually get the care. That’s devastating for people.” skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Breaking News Australia Get the most important news as it breaks Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

f508a63f2336,Albanese urged to ‘secure the future of science’ as CSIRO reckons with ongoing decline in funding,,"CSIRO will embark on further cost- cutting to research units in a bid to repair a multimillion-dollar budget shortfall, as Australia’s national science and research agency reckons with an ongoing decline in funding. The institution’s annual funding level as a percentage of GDP has been falling with few exceptions over recent decades and is now at its lowest since 1978, a parliamentary library analysis commissioned by ACT senator David Pocock showed. Pocock requested data from 1980 in the analysis. Sign up: AU Breaking News email The analysis, which used GDP, CPI and population data to adjust for real figures, showed CSIRO’s funding has dropped from 0.16% of GDP in 1978-79 to just 0.03% of GDP in 2024-25. Under the Albanese government, the funding as a percentage of GDP has continued to decline after it briefly rose to 0.05% in 2020-21 as a result of a Covid-19 funding injection by the then Morrison government. Chart showing CSIRO funding as a percentage of GDP While the nominal funding figures have remained relatively steady, the adjusted figures represent real cuts to the agency over a nearly five-decade period. Pocock said CSIRO’s “value to our nation’s productivity, innovation and overall wellbeing cannot be overstated”. “Successive governments need to stop asking it to do more with less and start once again investing in the kind of research that made us the lucky country back when the CSIRO was first established,” he said. At a Senate estimates hearing on Friday, CSIRO’s chief executive, Doug Hilton, acknowledged the agency’s budget allocation “has not kept up with the cost of doing science”. Hilton said CSIRO had to refit ageing buildings to “maintain safe, fit-for-purpose and, where appropriate and possible, cutting edge facilities”. “We do have some challenging sustainability issues as an organisation,” he said. CSIRO’s funding cliff became apparent in recent years after the expiration of $454m provided in the October 2020 budget. The agency’s budget statement in March showed there would be a $91m reduction in employee expenses for 2025-26 compared with the previous year. The agency is undergoing a restructure in both research and non-research areas to fix its budget, which has so far led to a 12.7% headcount reduction since July 2024. CSIRO’s chief finance officer, Tom Munyard, told Senate estimates this amounted to about 818 jobs, with further job cuts expected to revealed over the course of this financial year. At a four-day workshop in Melbourne in September, research unit leaders met with management to determine where CSIRO could “consolidate and focus” its research. “Although we don’t know the details yet, I want to be clear: we will need to exit some research and do fewer things better, more deeply and more impactfully,” Hilton said in an email before the meeting. The science minister, Tim Ayres, disputed Pocock’s suggestion that CSIRO’s funding had fallen under Labor but acknowledged the difference between nominal and real funding. Ayres told Senate estimates the government had given CSIRO a “significant contribution” but he expected the institution to make sure it was “on a sustainable budget footing”. “I also want to make sure, as the minister responsible for science in the commonwealth government, that CSIRO is continuing to evolve its approach to making sure that its programs of effort are in line with the national science priorities of the country and what the country needs in order to solve the big national challenges in front of us,” he said. The main public sector union, the Community and Public Sector Union, said the government should be “backing the CSIRO to be taking risks and tackling challenges, not forcing them to be penny pinchers”. “But funding shortfalls are forcing hundreds of scientists and their research out the door. We’ve already seen more than 700 jobs cut from CSIRO, and hundreds more are expected to go,” Susan Tonks, CPSU’s CSIRO spokesperson, said. “If we are going to be able to tackle the challenges of tomorrow, we need publicly funded science and scientists to feel empowered and supported. But right now, staff at the CSIRO are looking over their shoulders wondering if it is their job that’s next to go. “The Albanese government needs to step in and secure the future of science in this country.”",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/oct/14/albanese-urged-to-secure-the-future-of-science-as-csiro-reckons-with-ongoing-decline-in-funding,World,BBC,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e3743b7947a3ad6645858be69a8c65fc6db83b47/1077_0_2945_2358/master/2945.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=b15617a0fb9139c88bf8e151fcb6a6c3",2025-10-13T14:00:03+00:00,91c2c40f3482c4c923179e14fa508c13a7a1ceff
cfc6b6d868ea,Minister urged to release advice amid concern overhaul of NSW housing laws may lead to coalmine approvals,,"The New South Wales planning minister, Paul Scully, is under pressure to release details of advice he has sought on corruption risks associated with a major overhaul of the planning system designed to speed up housing. Environmental groups and integrity experts have warned the new planning reforms go well beyond setting up a fast track for housing and would give the minister and his departmental secretary extraordinary powers to wave through development like mines without proper environmental assessment. The government has sought advice from Icac on two new bodies: the Development Coordination Authority – which will coordinate responses from all the government approvals agencies such as Sydney Water and the Rural Fire Service – and the Housing Development Authority – which decides which developments over $60m can be put on a fast track approval by the NSW planning department. The bill is expected to be debated this week. Greens MP Sue Higginson said Icac had confirmed to her it had not reviewed the bill, but had given general advice on some elements of it. Sign up: AU Breaking News email A spokesperson for Icac told the Guardian: “The commission provided probity advice to the Department of Planning, Housing and Infrastructure (DPHI) on several occasions in 2024 and 2025, which included on the establishment of the Development Coordination Authority and the Housing Delivery Authority.” It said it could not release the advice as it was confidential. However, it noted that the minister was free to release the advice. Higginson said the bill had been “sold as housing reform, but what it really does is winds back environmental protections, applies to all development and hands extraordinary power to the Minister and a new bureaucracy, which is essentially the Planning Secretary, with no independent oversight”. “The government has told the parliament that Icac helped shape these reforms, but Icac has confirmed that it was never asked to review or comment on the bill. This is a serious integrity failure,” she added. Higginson said Icac had confirmed it had not been asked or for advice on controversial Targeted Assessment Development, which provides a streamlined approvals process without the need for environmental assessment. Environmental groups are particularly worried about this new pathway. Critics say the bill appears to prohibit authorities from considering environmental and community impacts of projects that go through this path. The chair of the Centre for Public integrity, Anthony Whealy, said the legislation may apply beyond housing and would provide a fast track for approving other types of development such as mines and power plants. “The legislation also seems to pose a threat to integrity and proper scrutiny of development,” he said. “That’s the grave concern for the environment.” skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Breaking News Australia Get the most important news as it breaks Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

In a letter to Higginson, Icac elaborated on what it had given advice on saying the advice provided by the commission addressed “several probity-related matters”. These included the importance of managing conflicting public duties, private interests and potential “revolving door” risks. “Commission officers also discussed the need for measurable assessment criteria, ensuring transparency through clear documentation and communication records, verifying proponent claims and the separation between assessment and decision-making. “Additionally, advice was provided concerning the need to manage lobbying activities and prevent any compromise of due process,” the letter from Icac said.

a792794b93d7,Macron accuses rivals of fuelling instability as he dismisses calls to resign,,"The French president, Emmanuel Macron , has accused rival political parties of fuelling instability in France, as he brushed aside calls by the opposition for him to resign amid France’s worst political crisis in decades. “Many of those who have fuelled division and speculation have not risen to the moment,” Macron said of French opposition parties, as he arrived in Egypt on Monday to attend a summit on Gaza. He said rival “political forces” were “solely responsible for this chaos” after they “instigated the destabilisation” of the prime minister, Sébastien Lecornu . Lecornu, a Macron ally, held his first meeting with France’s new government after he appointed a mix of stalwarts from Macron’s centrist grouping, as well as a few faces from the upper ranks of the civil service and civil society. New arrivals included Jean-Pierre Farandou, who headed the state-run railway, SNCF, and is now labour minister. Laurent Nuñez, who served as a junior minister in the interior ministry during the gilets jaunes (yellow vests) protests of 2018 and 2019, was appointed to the key post of interior minister. He had recently served as Paris police chief, where he had been responsible for the policing of last year’s Olympic Games. It is France’s second government in a week: Lecornu’s first government collapsed after only 14 hours amid backlash over a lack of fresh faces, and he dramatically resigned last Monday. Lecornu was then reappointed by Macron on Friday night and quickly assembled a new administration on Sunday. “How long will it last?” several regional newspapers asked, including La Provence in the south and La République du Centre. France has lurched from crisis to crisis since Macron’s gamble on a snap election last year that led to an inconclusive result. Parliament remains divided between the three blocs: the left, the far right and the centre, with no clear majority. Some parties have called on Macron to resign. “Never forget that the mandate given by the French people is to serve, to serve and serve, and to provide answers to the questions of everyday French people, and to do everything possible for the independence of France,” Macron told reporters in Egypt. “That is the only thing that matters. The rest is the government’s business … I will continue to ensure stability.” Macron’s term ends in spring 2027. He declined to speculate on a possible dissolution of parliament and snap election if the latest government fails. “I’m not making any bets,” he said. “I want the country to move forward.” Lecornu faces the urgent and complex task of getting a 2026 budget through parliament by the end of the year. He told ministers: “Our only task is to surpass the political crisis.” He said that political crisis was exasperating French people and observers worldwide. He called on the government to “put egos aside” and work collegiately to find compromise. Lecornu will deliver his first key policy speech to the French parliament on Tuesday afternoon. The leftwing La France Insoumise party and the far-right National Rally are due to put down motions for a no-confidence vote. For the government to be toppled, several opposition parties would have to group together to back the vote, including the Socialists. The Socialist party has said it will wait to hear Lecornu’s policy speech before deciding. It has warned it could vote against the government unless Lecornu suspends Macron’s controversial 2023 law that installed a gradual rise in the retirement age from 62 to 64 . The new cabinet is expected to present a draft budget on Tuesday morning that will include cuts on public spending. The government must give parliament the constitutionally required 70 days to scrutinise the plan before the end of the year. “We have to give this country a budget, otherwise we’re heading for catastrophe,” the new minister for external commerce, Nicolas Forissier, told Ici Berry television.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/oct/13/macron-accuses-rivals-fuelling-france-instability-dismisses-calls-resign,World,BBC,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/da930b86eeaf0ce8fdb3183389b8a0f35e76378e/176_68_2864_2292/master/2864.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=8717b6e2dbe23430825a6b34565962c7",2025-10-13T15:08:58+00:00,149dd313162ff63f970478815ecdb1c7a9f6c867
84326a31448c,Hamas deploys armed fighters and police across parts of Gaza,,"Hamas has started deploying armed fighters and police across parts of Gaza in an apparent attempt to reassert authority in the devastated Palestinian territory after the ceasefire deal agreed with Israel last week. Images showed dozens of Hamas fighters at a hospital in southern Gaza during the release of Israeli hostages on Monday morning and there were reports of shootings and executions elsewhere in the territory. Telegram channels associated with Hamas said “collaborators and traitors” had been targeted, a reference to Israel-backed militia in the territory , while Hamas gunmen also engaged in bloody clashes with a powerful local family in Gaza City over the weekend. The violence is unlikely to immediately threaten the current ceasefire agreement with Israel but raises significant concerns over the disarmament of Hamas , a key though ill-defined provision of the deal, and the challenges that will confront the new stabilisation force of regional troops that is to be deployed to Gaza. Asked by a journalist on Air Force One about reports that Hamas was moving against rivals to regain control in parts of Gaza, the US president, Donald Trump , suggested the militant Islamist organisation was acting within the parameters of the ceasefire deal. “They do want to stop the problems and they’ve been open about it, and we gave them approval for a period of time … You have close to 2 million people going back to buildings that have been demolished, and a lot of bad things can happen. So we want it to be – we want it to be safe. I think it’s going to be fine. Who knows for sure,” Trump said. On Monday, the first steps of the first phase of the new agreement were completed with the release by Hamas and transfer to Israel of 20 living hostages. Simultaneously, Israeli authorities began freeing about 2,000 prisoners, including 250 serving lengthy sentences. Huge crowds welcome freed Palestinian prisoners in Ramallah – video Hundreds of trucks of aid and commercial goods have entered Gaza since Sunday, sending prices in markets tumbling. Famine was declared in parts of the territory in August and aid agencies say much greater quantities of supplies are needed urgently. Looting by organised gangs or desperate communities made distribution of aid in Gaza extremely difficult for major humanitarian organisation, which were also hampered by Israeli restrictions and ongoing combat operations. The Israel Defense Forces have already withdrawn to new positions and currently control just over half of Gaza. Much of the territory is in ruins , with the population now concentrated along the coastal zone of al-Mawasi, the badly damaged towns of the centre and Gaza City. Hamas exerted a significant degree of control over these three areas even if the group maintained a low profile, Israeli military officials and senior aid workers said last month. But the militant group has suffered significant losses during the two-year conflict with Israel, with most of its senior or middle-ranking military commanders and thousands of lower-ranking fighters killed. Police officers were targeted by Israel and prisons destroyed along with a lot of other infrastructure. Law and order has collapsed across much of Gaza, with armed families, clans, gangs, looters and militia growing more powerful. At the weekend, Hossam al-Astal, the leader of a new militia aligned with Israel , was defiant. “To all the Hamas rats, your tunnels are destroyed, your rights don’t exist any more. Repent before it is too late – there is no Hamas from today onward,” he said in a social media post. Al-Astal was unwilling to talk when contacted on Monday. Also now vulnerable is Yasser Abu Shabab, the leader of the so-called Popular Forces, an Israel-backed militia based in the south of Gaza . There are unconfirmed reports of punishment beatings and shootings of members of his faction. One Hamas security official said a hunt was under way for Abu Shabab, adding that one of the fugitive leader’s aides had been “liquidated” in recent days. “The security campaign is continuing and escalating until this issue is completely over, and no party will be allowed to violate the law,” he said. In a statement, the Ministry of Interior in Gaza, which has been controlled by Hamas since the group seized power in 2007, said it was making efforts to restore “security and stability” in the territory, but that “the gate for repentance and general amnesty” was open for all those who joined “gangs” but were not involved in any murders. “All concerned individuals must surrender to security services within a week to settle their legal and security status and permanently close their files”, the ministry said. Only one of the fighters seen escorting hostages to Red Cross vehicles on Monday appeared to be wearing Hamas insignia: a shoulder patch showed him to be a member of an elite unit of Hamas’s military wing, the Izz al-Din al-Qassam brigades. Hamas flags and headbands were absent, a marked contrast to the elaborately staged hostage handovers earlier this year that Israel cited as a justification for its decision to break the short-lived ceasefire.

2b38b6cb12be,Trump plan to invite Netanyahu to Gaza summit aborted after Erdoğan warning,,"A last-minute plan by Donald Trump to invite Benjamin Netanyahu to a multinational Gaza summit in Egypt had to be aborted after the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan , said he would not land his plane in Sharm el-Sheikh if the invitation stood. The mid-air power power struggle started after it was announced that the Israeli prime minister had accepted a late invitation from Trump to the conference being jointly chaired by the US president and his Egyptian counterpart, Abdel Fatah al-Sisi, in Egypt. Netanyahu’s presence at the summit in Sharm el-Sheikh had apparently been sealed by Trump in a phone call from Israel on Monday morning with Sisi. It is not clear if Erdoğan’s refusal to land for the summit was the cause of Netanyahu changing his plans, but it is known that he spoke to Sisi to raise his objections from his plane above Egypt . A statement from the Israeli prime minister’s office said: “Prime Minister Netanyahu was invited by US President Trump to participate in a conference taking place today in Egypt. The prime minister thanked President Trump for his invitation but stated that he would not be able to attend due to the proximity of the event to the start of the holiday.” Figures on the extreme right in Netanyahu’s coalition government had also threatened to resign if he went to the conference. International criminal court arrest warrants have been issued against Netanyahu for alleged war crimes in Gaza , and while Egypt is not a signatory to the court, his presence at the summit would have been contentious, including among those Arab states that have not normalised relations with Israel. More than 20 world leaders were due to attend the hastily arranged summit. The row about Netanyahu’s presence shows how hard it will be for some Muslim countries to normalise relations with Israel in the way Trump wants. Pictures of Erdoğan negotiating with Netanyahu or shaking hands with the Israeli leader would have been disastrous for the Turkish leader domestically, and would have also led to questions about Ankara’s planned role in the international stabilisation force that is due to look after security in Gaza. Erdoğan has repeatedly called Israel’s actions in Gaza a genocide.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/oct/13/trump-invite-netanyahu-gaza-summit-aborted-erdogan-warning,World,BBC,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d21b74fb5e0156ddc241e9cfe96d7eeab1f3cfac/477_0_3842_3073/master/3842.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=811f06b13f849ce330b1b50fae4cc525",2025-10-13T13:56:17+00:00,afafdfc388dba78ead70f13fe0d90a40c3bda1ef

Consumers started reporting problems on the website of the outage monitor Downdetector from about 3pm on Monday. By 3.20pm the number of reports of service disruption had surged to more than 135,000. According to a breakdown of the reported incidents, more than two-thirds related to customers who have Vodafone’s internet broadband services to their homes. Almost a quarter of reported incidents related to mobile internet access, and about 8% of Vodafone customers reported not being able to make calls because of no mobile signal. Some customers said they also could not access the Vodafone app or website. The problems appeared to be widespread, with reports in cities including London, Birmingham, Cardiff, Glasgow and Manchester. A Vodafone spokesperson said: “We are aware of a major issue on our network currently affecting broadband, 4G and 5G services. “We appreciate our customers’ patience while we work to resolve this as soon as possible.” skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Business Today Get set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morning Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

a49b4a5f920c,Lab-grown cells replicate early development of human heart,,"Scientists have grown embryo-like structures in the laboratory that replicate the early development of the heart, including the production of blood, raising new possibilities for regenerative medicine. The ability to generate blood stem cells in the laboratory may one day make it possible to treat patients in need of bone marrow transplants using their own cells. The advance is the latest in a rapidly advancing field in which embryo models are created from stem cells without the need for eggs or sperm, opening a window on the earliest stages of human development. “It was an exciting moment when the blood-red colour appeared in the dish – it was visible even to the naked eye,” said Dr Jitesh Neupane, a researcher at the University of Cambridge’s Gurdon Institute and first author of the study. He and his colleagues are using the model system to understand the earliest developmental stages of heart and blood development. “This sheds light on how blood cells naturally form during human embryogenesis, offering potential medical advances to screen drugs, study early blood and immune development, and model blood disorders like leukaemia,” said Neupane. The human stem cells used to grow the embryo-like structures can be created from any cell in the body. This means the approach could also pave the way for the production of blood that is fully compatible with a patient’s own body. Although other methods exist for generating human blood stem cells in the laboratory, these require a cocktail of extra proteins, whereas the new method mimics the natural developmental process in which self-organising structures drive the formation of different cell types. “Although it is still in the early stages, the ability to produce human blood cells in the lab marks a significant step towards future regenerative therapies – which use a patient’s own cells to repair and regenerate damaged tissues,” said Prof Azim Surani at the Gurdon Institute, senior author of the paper. In this latest study, scientists used human stem cells to replicate some of the cells and structures that would typically appear in the third and fourth week of pregnancy. The model was specifically designed to lack the tissues that go on to form the placenta and yolk sac in a natural embryo, meaning that it did not have the theoretical potential of developing into a foetus and did not develop the tissues that would go on to form the brain. “This is a minimalistic system,” said Neupane. The team observed the emergence of the three-dimensional embryo-like structures under a microscope. By the second day, they had self-organised into three germ layers – called the ectoderm, mesoderm and endoderm – the foundations of the human body plan. By day eight, beating heart cells had formed, the cells that eventually give rise to the heart in a developing human embryo. By day 13, the team saw red patches of blood appearing. Blood stem cells taken from the model were also shown to be able to differentiate into various blood cell types, including oxygen-carrying red blood cells and white blood cells that are crucial to the immune system. The findings are published in the journal Cell Reports .",https://www.theguardian.com/science/2025/oct/13/lab-grown-cells-replicate-early-development-human-heart,World,BBC,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e5a7171487d96a0fad46c37978efd5f3185ad987/0_166_1082_866/master/1082.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=f6dcef5d12a9d7f23d2f744fb04a3283",2025-10-13T15:00:02+00:00,ef5907da6d84e678574806d1ea51260aae2a788e
fb4f6ad875e7,"Carmakers chose to cheat to sell cars rather than comply with emissions law, ‘dieselgate’ trial told",,"Car manufacturers decided they would rather cheat to prioritise “customer convenience” and sell cars than comply with the law on deadly pollutants, the first trial day of the largest group action in English legal history has been told. More than a decade after the original “dieselgate” scandal broke, lawyers representing 1.6 million diesel car owners in the UK argue that manufacturers deliberately installed software to rig emissions tests . They allege the “prohibited defeat devices” could detect when the cars were under test conditions and ensure that harmful NOx emissions were kept within legal limits, duping regulators and drivers. Should the claim be upheld, estimated damages could exceed £6bn. The three-month hearing that opened at London’s high court on Monday will focus on vehicles sold by five manufacturers – Mercedes, Ford, Renault, Nissan and Peugeot/Citroën – from 2009. In “real world” conditions, when driven on the road, lawyers argue, the cars produced much higher levels of emissions. The judgment on the five lead defendants will also bind other manufacturers including Jaguar Land Rover, Vauxhall/Opel, Volkswagen/Porsche, BMW, FCA/Suzuki, Volvo, Hyundai-Kia, Toyota and Mazda, whose cases are not being heard to reduce the case time and costs. Opening the case for the claimants, Thomas de la Mare KC said: “Each player in the industry basically took a conscious decision that customer convenience, which helped the industry sell more cars, was more important than reducing pollutants causing death.” In written submissions, the claimants quoted a Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air report that found excess NOx emissions had caused 124,000 premature deaths in the UK and Europe between 2009 and 2024. De la Mare told the high court levels of emissions could have easily been reduced had vehicles had larger tanks for AdBlue – an additive that cuts NOx in diesel vehicles – and asked customers to refill them. Instead, he said: “They have basically said the concern about making these cars sellable by removing these inconveniences is so strong … that we would rather cheat than comply with the law.” The lead barrister also told the judge, Mrs Justice Cockerill, that manufacturers were trying to argue that numerous prior dieselgate rulings abroad, including in the US and European court of justice, did not apply to the UK. He said: “Our position is broadly that we will rely on foreign regulatory decisions as a matter of fact, rather than an opinion on law.” He said that the defendants’ argument meant that “mainland GB becomes a sort of defeat device Brexit Island … But Northern Ireland is applying case law that you’re being asked to put in the bin.” Internal training and briefing documents from Ford in 2010 on defeat devices showed, he said, that: “The manufacturers could and did understand the law exactly as we do now.” Lawyers for the defendants will make opening statements later this week. The car manufacturers deny having used prohibited defeat devices. skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Business Today Get set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morning Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Mercedes said the claimants case was “obsessively focused” on NOx pollution rather than other emissions, and did not “acknowledge the complexity” of diesel engineering. Lawyers for Nissan said the case’s central legal premise was “an untenably broad reading of defeat device”. The main trial, establishing the evidence, is expected to conclude before Christmas, with a break before legal arguments are heard in March 2026.

In Alaska , rescue aircraft were sent to the villages of Kipnuk and Kwigillingok, where there were reports of up to 20 people possibly unaccounted for. “We have received reports that people’s homes have floated away and that people were potentially in those homes,” Zidek, a spokesperson for the state division of homeland security and emergency management, told the Associated Press. The area is among one of the most isolated in the US, where some communities have few roads and residents use boardwalks, boats and snowmobiles to get around, Zidek said. The Alaska governor, Mike Dunleavy, extended a disaster declaration to communities in the Yupitt, Pribilof Island and Lower Kuskokwim education districts. “Every effort will be made to help those hit by this storm. Help is on the way,” Dunleavy said in a statement on X. Separately, the storm making its way up the east coast prompted flooding and high winds in coastal areas from the Carolinas to New England. In Delaware, emergency management officials activated the state national guard in response to rising floodwaters and harsh winds. In North Carolina’s Outer Banks, seawater washed over highway 12 at a motel near Buxton. Flooding was reported as widespread in Georgetown county in South Carolina, where several motorists had to be rescued when rising water; in Charleston, many downtown streets were closed because of rising waters; and in Myrtle Beach, heavy rain overwhelmed that city’s stormwater system. “Please be safe and stay home, if possible,” Myrtle Beach officials posted on Facebook. As the storm moved up to the coast, all of New Jersey was placed under a state of emergency. The New York governor, Kathy Hochul, issued a similar declaration for eight southern counties, urging people to monitor forecasts and avoid travel. The National Weather Service placed New York City, Long Island and southern Westchester county under a coastal flood warning and wind advisory through at least Monday afternoon. The emergency declaration, which included the five boroughs of New York City and Westchester county, forced the cancellation of the annual Columbus Day parade in Manhattan, news outlets reported. Among the areas hardest hit were coastal areas of suburban Long Island, where up to 3in of rain and winds packing peak gusts of 45 to 50 mph inland away from the shore, and 55 to 60 mph on the coast. “Those are starting to come down,” National Weather Service meteorologist Dave Stark, told Newsday early Monday.

Disney+ will air the six-episode series The End of an Era from 12 December onwards, with the first two episodes launching on that date. Two episodes will air each week in the following two weeks. There will also be a separate film of the final concert of the Eras tour at Vancouver’s BC Place, entitled The Eras Tour | The Final Show, airing from 12 December. “It was the End of an Era and we knew it,” Swift wrote on Instagram, announcing the projects. “We wanted to remember every moment leading up to the culmination of the most important and intense chapter of our lives, so we allowed film-makers to capture this tour and all the stories woven throughout it as it wound down. And to film the final show in its entirety.” Between March 2023 and December 2024, Eras encompassed 149 concerts across five continents and became the highest-grossing concert tour in history, with over $2bn in ticket sales. With a runtime of more than three and a half hours, and later described by Swift as “absolutely the most challenging thing I’ve ever done in my life”, its setlist drew from all but one of Swift’s studio albums, with the later shows adding material from her 2024 album The Tortured Poets Department . Swift has already released a filmed version of the tour, entitled Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour , but its October 2023 release date meant it did not feature The Tortured Poets Department material. It became the highest-grossing tour film of all time, earning $267m from its global run in cinemas. It was later available to stream on Disney+. Financial terms for that deal, and for the new filmed projects, have not been made public. With Swift’s reference to “all the stories woven throughout [Eras] as it wound down”, the series could document the creation of her latest album The Life of a Showgirl, which was made in part during the Eras tour. “What it ended up doing was like reinvigorating every single aspect of my life, including the tour,” she has said. The Life of a Showgirl, her 12th studio album, was released on 3 October and has been one of Swift’s most commercially successful but critically divisive albums. It has the largest single-week sales of any album in US history, beating the record set by Adele’s 25 , and the second-highest in UK history, behind Ed Sheeran’s ÷. But the Guardian’s Alexis Petridis wrote that the album has a “distinct lack of undeniable hooks and nailed-on melodies” – one of a number of relatively rare negative reviews for Swift, with Pitchfork, the Standard and others also criticising the album.",https://www.theguardian.com/music/2025/oct/13/taylor-swift-announces-behind-the-scenes-eras-tour-docuseries-plus-new-concert-film-the-end-of-an-era,World,BBC,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cc02cfdc091aaf89aa9212202e085dd236a31072/446_0_4464_3572/master/4464.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=1a18e8309499167445dc1bf9c46d8e80",2025-10-13T13:57:53+00:00,4cc44abbeff8165765b5553dc4f4aa9c2e8da500
d4a11a1d7f85,‘Quintessentially Portland’: nude cyclists protest against national guard deployment,,"Protesters rallying against the Trump administration in Portland put the city’s quirky and irreverent reputation on display on Sunday by pedaling through the streets wearing absolutely nothing – or close to it – in an “emergency” edition of the annual World Naked Bike Ride. Crowds that have gathered daily and nightly outside the immigration facility in Oregon’s largest city in recent days have embraced the absurd, donning inflatable frog, unicorn, axolotl and banana costumes as they face off with federal law enforcement who often deploy teargas and pepper balls. The bike ride is an annual tradition that usually happens in the summer, but organizers of this weekend’s hastily called event said another nude ride was necessary to speak out against Donald Trump’s attempts to mobilize the national guard to quell protests. Rider Janene King called the nude ride a “quintessentially Portland way to protest”. The 51-year-old was naked except for wool socks, a wig and a hat. She sipped hot tea and said she was unbothered by the steady rain and temperatures in the mid-50sF (about 12C). “We definitely do not want troops coming into our city,” King said. Bike riders made their way through the streets and to the city’s US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) building. Authorities there ordered people to stay out of the street and protest only on sidewalks or risk being arrested. The city is awaiting the ruling of an appeals court panel on whether Trump can send out the federalized troops after a federal judge on 5 October ordered a temporary hold on deployment. “Joy is a form of protest. Being together with mutual respect and kindness is a form of protest,” the ride’s organizers said on Instagram. “It’s your choice how much or little you wear.” Fewer people were fully naked than usual – likely because of the cool, wet weather – but some still bared it all and rode wearing only bike helmets. Naked bike rides have thronged the streets of Oregon’s largest city every year since 2004, often holding up traffic as the crowd cycles through with speakers playing music.

340b2321896c,Former French president Nicolas Sarkozy ordered to go to jail next week,,"The former French president Nicolas Sarkozy has been ordered to go to jail in Paris next week after a court last month sentenced him to five months in prison for criminal conspiracy over a scheme to obtain election campaign funds from the regime of the late Libyan dictator Muammar Gaddafi. Sarkozy, who was the rightwing president of France between 2007 and 2012, was summoned to meet state prosecutors on Monday. They told him he must present himself at the entrance of La Santé prison in the south of Paris on 21 October to begin his sentence. The 70-year-old will be the first French postwar leader and the first former head of a European Union country to go to jail. He had already become the first former French head of state forced to wear an electronic tag after being convicted in a separate case of corruption and influence peddling over illegal attempts to secure favours from a judge. In that case, he was given a one-year-jail term but was able to serve it with an electronic tag worn around the ankle. He wore the tag for three months before being granted conditional release. Sarkozy, who denied wrongdoing and having being part of a criminal conspiracy to seek election funding from Libya for his victorious 2007 presidential campaign, has appealed against his conviction. A new trial is expected in about six months. But the nature of Sarkozy’s prison sentence means he must go to jail as his appeal process plays out. Sarkozy was reported to have hosted 100 friends and former collaborators in Paris last week at a sort of goodbye party before going to prison. Le Figaro said he had told guests he was innocent and should never have been found guilty. Talking about prison, he reportedly said: “I will ask for no advantages. When there is a cross to bear, you must bear it to the end.” Sarkozy is expected to have his own individual prison cell, with one hour’s exercise a day and three visits a week. Sarkozy was found guilty of criminal conspiracy but acquitted of three separate charges of corruption, misuse of Libyan public funds and illegal election campaign funding. The public prosecutor had told the court that Sarkozy entered into a “Faustian pact of corruption with one of the most unspeakable dictators of the last 30 years” to gain election funding from Gaddafi. Outside court, after judges delivered their guilty verdict, Sarkozy had said: “If they absolutely want me to sleep in jail, I will sleep in jail, but with my head held high.” skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to This is Europe The most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environment Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

6b594c20f22f,Tommy Robinson says Elon Musk is paying his legal costs as trial begins,,"Tommy Robinson claimed Elon Musk was paying his legal costs, as he went on trial for refusing to comply with a request made by counter-terrorism police as he tried to leave Britain last year. The far-right activist, whose real name is Stephen Yaxley Lennon, refused to give police the pin for his phone because it had “journalistic material on it” after they stopped him at the Channel tunnel on 28 July 2024, a court heard. The activist had arrived alone at the Channel tunnel in a silver Bentley belonging to a friend and was on his way to the Spanish resort of Benidorm with more than £13,000 in a small bag, the first day of the trial at Westminster magistrates court heard. The money was said to have been from a collection to offset the expenses from organising a major rally of Robinson’s supporters that took place the day before in Trafalgar Square. Robinson told police he was white English but was travelling on an Irish passport he had recently obtained and that he lived in Spain. Police were suspicious of his “vague replies” to questions and requested access to his iPhone under schedule 7 of the Terrorism Act, which allows for the stopping of anyone passing through a UK port to “determine whether they may be involved or concerned in the commission, preparation or instigation of acts of terrorism”. Robinson, who denies failing to comply with the counter-terrorism powers, said in video recorded before he entered court: “Thankfully, I haven’t had to beg for donations today because Elon Musk has picked up the legal bill for this absolute state persecution.” Musk has been contacted to confirm whether he is covering the bill. The X and Tesla boss has emerged as an ally of Robinson and recently appeared on a live video link at a far-right rally organised in London by Robinson, where Musk told the crowd: “Whether you choose violence or not, violence is coming to you.” Opening the case, the prosecutor Jo Morris said officers “became concerned” about the activist’s demeanour after he drove alone into the police inspection area. He had been recognised by police at an early stage and was restrained when he tried to start filming them and recorded a message that he was being detained, she said. When he was asked to hand over the phone’s pin, Robinson was said to have replied: “Not a chance, bruv … You look like cunts so you ain’t having it.” He told police at the tunnel and said in a later interview at Folkestone police station that his phone contained information about “vulnerable girls” whom he had spoken to during what he described as his journalistic reporting on grooming gangs. PC Mitchell Thorogood, a counter-terrorism officer who was in the booth when Robinson arrived at Folkestone, told the court that the Bentley Bentayga SUV – prices for which start at £170,000 – had attracted their attention. It was also a last-minute booking and “unusual” for someone to take a long trip in someone else’s car Asked by Robinson’s barrister, Alisdair Williamson KC: “Do terrorists drive in high-value, high-visibility vehicles?” he replied that terrorists could drive “any type of vehicle”. The lawyer, who said that the activist “frequently” travels to Benidorm later suggested that stop may have been “discriminatory” against Robinson’s political beliefs. Sgt Farmer, who carried out an initial consideration of the decision to stop Robinson under counter-terrorism powers, told the court that the activist’s involvement in the English Defence League (EDL) and the “emerging threat level” from the far right had also been cited as a factor. Under questioning, Farmer said he had experience as a public order officer policing demonstrations by the EDL. He said he was aware it had disbanded in 2014 but said there was still a concern over far-right ideology “in terms of perceived Islamophobia”. Earlier, District Judge Sam Goozee gave an instruction that Robinson’s address should not be published, after Williamson said there were “credible threats” against the activist’s life. The trial, which is expected to take two days, was adjourned until Tuesday.",https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/oct/13/tommy-robinson-says-elon-musk-is-paying-his-legal-costs-as-trial-begins,World,BBC,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7b357a55cde6216a99d90c884f2e0e033d0a5af8/1007_547_4281_3424/master/4281.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=505d75cd357248550644b072612a9a40",2025-10-13T15:58:28+00:00,6024773895614e1bf2d9cffdd149ad17a132a811
6bdffd6f9a12,Equity threatens mass direct action over use of actors’ images in AI content,,"The performing arts union Equity has threatened mass direct action over tech and entertainment companies’ use of its members’ likenesses, images and voices in AI content without permission. The warning came as the union said growing numbers of its members had made complaints about infringements of their copyright and misuse of their personal data in AI material. Its general secretary, Paul W Fleming, said it planned to coordinate data requests en masse to companies to force them to disclose whether they used members’ data in AI-generated material without consent. Last week the union confirmed its was supporting a Scottish actor who believes her image was used in the creation of the “AI actor” Tilly Norwood, which has been widely condemned by the film industry. Briony Monroe, 28, from East Renfrewshire, said she believed that an image of her face had been used to make the digital character, created by the AI “talent studio” Xicoia, which has denied her claims. Most of the complaints Equity has received from members concerned AI-generated voice replicas. Fleming said the union has already helped members make subject access requests to producers and tech companies which failed to provide satisfactory explanations about where the data they used to create AI content came from. He said: “The companies actually became very willing to start discussing compensation and usage. So the industry needs to be more careful because it’s not going to stop there. “AI companies need to know that we will be putting in these subject access requests en masse. They have a statutory obligation to respond. If an individual member reasonably believes that their data is being used without their consent, we want to find out.” Fleming said he hoped the tactic would push tech companies and producers resistant to being transparent about the sources of their AI content to strike an agreement on performers’ rights. “What we’re trying to do is use people’s individual rights to make it so hard for tech companies and producers to not enter into collective rights,” said Fleming. As the union has 50,000 members, significant numbers of them making subject access requests would create a “hassle” for firms unwilling to negotiate, he added. Under data protection law, individuals have the right to ask for all the information an organisation holds about them. Organisations normally have one month to reply to a subject access request. “It’s not a silver bullet,” Fleming added. “It’s not easy to do because they may well have got data from somewhere else. A lot of people are behaving very recklessly and immorally.” Monroe said she believed that Norwood had copied both her image and her mannerisms. Monroe said: “I move my head quite a lot when I’m acting. I noticed in the last few seconds of Tilly’s show reel, that is exactly what she did. Other people have also said, ‘Those are your mannerisms. That’s how you act.’” Liam Budd, industrial official for recorded media at Equity UK, said the union was taking Monroe’s concerns seriously. The AI production company Particle6, which launched Xicoia earlier this month, confirmed it was working with the union “to address any concerns”. A spokesperson for Particle6 added: “Briony Monroe’s likeness, image, voice or personal data have not been used in any way to create Tilly Norwood. “Tilly was developed entirely from scratch using original creative design. We do not and will not use any performer’s likeness without explicit consent and fair compensation.” Although he would not comment on Monroe’s complaint, Budd said: “We’ve had increasing numbers of members getting in touch about specific infringements where they believe that their image or voice has been used without their consent to then create an output which can identify them or resembles them in some way. “It’s been a lot more common in the audio space because the technology is much easier. You don’t need many recordings to create a digital replica of a voice.” But Norwood represented a new challenge for the industry, said Budd, because “we haven’t really seen the launch of a wholly synthetic actor” before. Equity UK has been in negotiations with the UK production trade body Pact (Producers Alliance for Cinema and Television) about AI, copyright and data protection for more than a year. Fleming said: “The bosses are not asking questions about where this data has come from. Privately, they will admit that it is impossible to ethically use AI because it has been scraped and trained on data where the provenance is at best unclear. “But nine times out of 10, we know it’s been used completely outside of the existing copyright and data protection framework.” Max Rumney, the deputy chief executive of Pact, said its members needed to use AI technology in production or they would be at a commercial disadvantage to those firms with no collective agreements with unions, who did not remunerate actors, writers and other creatives. But he added that there was no transparency from tech companies on what content or data had been used to train foundation models, the technology that underpins AI tools such as image generators. “The foundational models have been trained without permission on the films and programmes of our members,” said Rumney. “Our members want human creative expression in their films and programmes. They value this and consider that this is what makes UK productions so compelling and innovative.”",https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/oct/13/equity-threatens-mass-direct-action-over-use-of-actors-images-in-ai-content,World,BBC,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/76f351605d5413404fe43ac94d688bebc2d7e130/0_0_1614_1291/master/1614.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=30ddf84f0b8e8036ba238c8a7b18d8ba",2025-10-13T15:21:47+00:00,af33c0ea859f26a9cf4460e5419ad3868bed0f14
d80fc8852c6e,Firings of hundreds of CDC employees reportedly reversed,,"The firings of hundreds of employees at the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) have been reversed, according to several reports citing officials familiar with the matter, and the American Federation of Government Employees (AFGE), the largest union representing federal workers. On Friday, the White House budget office announced that as a result of the ongoing government shutdown, reductions in force (RIFs) across agencies have begun. A spokesperson for the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), which houses the CDC, initially said that all employees that received layoff notices “were designated non-essential by their respective divisions”. However, over the weekend, the administration rescinded more than half of the 1,300 termination notices it sent to public health officials at the CDC, according to Axios and Reuters , citing sources familiar. Around 600 people at the agency remain fired. On Saturday, the New York Times reported that members of the Epidemic Intelligence Service (EIS), informally known as “disease detectives”, as well as the team that compiles the widely respected scientific journal, the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report, were among the employees reinstated. Initially, around 70 members of EIS were laid off, according to the Times report. Also affected were Athalia Christie and Maureen Bartee, who are leading the federal response to the measles outbreak. The Times reported that the two infectious disease experts were laid off, only to receive an email saying that their firings “on or about” 10 October had been rescinded a day later. A senior administration official told the Times that the mistakenly fired workers “were sent incorrect notifications”, adding that “any correction has already been remedied”. A federal health official also told ABC News that the mistake was due to a “coding error”. Neither the White House nor HHS have immediately responded to the Guardian’s requests for comment about how many employees have been recalled to their roles. “These firings are an assault on the health and lives of every person in the US,” said Gregg Gonsalves, an epidemiologist and member of Defend Public Health, a volunteer network of experts who work to challenge the Trump administration’s public health policies. “Did they not care enough to find out who they were firing and what they did before sending termination letters? The carelessness and callousness with which this administration handles life and death matters is unbelievable.” The AFGE has filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration, seeking to block the firings across agencies. In a court filing, the government said that the layoffs across the federal workforce will impact over 4,000 employees. Later this week, a federal judge in San Francisco will hear arguments in the case. The CDC has endured significant tumult in recent months. In August, a gunman targeted the agency’s headquarters in Atlanta, firing hundreds of bullets and killing a police officer in the attack. The perpetrator had blamed the Covid vaccine for making him depressed and suicidal. Health secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr then fired the recently appointed CDC director, Susan Monarez, after she spent less than a month on the job. Monarez’s removal has become an acrimonious flash point at the agency. At a Senate committee hearing , Monzarez said that Kennedy fired her for not complying with his vaccine agenda, adding that the health secretary had called the CDC the “most corrupt federal agency in the world”. Following her removal, several public health leaders left the agency in protest of political interference in their work. Debra Houry, the former chief medical officer at the CDC, said Kennedy “censored CDC science, politicized its processes and stripped leaders of independence” while speaking alongside Monarez on Capitol Hill last month. “Think about what it’s like to be at CDC. It’s like living with an abusive partner that attacks and then takes back some of the abuse. That doesn’t make the partner less abusive. Sending strength to CDC staff held hostage,” said Demetre Daskalakis , who served as the director of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, and was part of the wave of CDC leadership to resign earlier this year. “CDC damage is done. Rescinded firings or not. US health security is compromised,” he added.",https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/13/firings-cdc-employees-reversed,World,BBC,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0b77dc2b9de08821ad7306a5149b7ceca0926731/203_0_1820_1457/master/1820.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=3993bae9e70158b7a529c638a8d18555",2025-10-13T15:48:51+00:00,93bee18ccfa1ccb8a40cba64373faa529600c861
