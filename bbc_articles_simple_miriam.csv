9e7e2fd304dd,UK to host international summit on Gaza recovery plan,,"The UK is to host an international summit on the recovery of Gaza, Downing Street has said, as Keir Starmer prepared to attend a multi-nation event in Egypt intended to finalise a truce in the Palestinian territory. The prime minister will be among an estimated 20 national leaders, among them Donald Trump, who will gather in Sharm el-Sheikh on Monday, with Starmer saying the aim must be to ensure a lasting peace after two years of devastating loss of life. As humanitarian groups geared up to send aid into Gaza , the UK has said that £20m in already-pledged aid will now be focused on water, sanitation and hygiene services. The funding will be delivered through Unicef, the World Food Programme and the Norwegian Refugee Council. The UK will also host a three-day conference organised by the Foreign Office’s Wilton Park agency, based in West Sussex, beginning on Monday afternoon. The event will include representatives from the Palestinian Authority as well as Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Germany and Italy. Other participants will include the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development and the World Bank, and private sector and development financiers. The discussions “will also cover efforts to support the Palestinian Authority’s own transformation and reform programme to ensure it can support Gaza’s recovery”, a Downing Street statement said, adding that while the process would be Palestinian-led, there was “absolutely no role for Hamas”. In a comment at the summit in Egypt released in advance, Starmer said: “We stand determined to seize this opportunity to deliver a lasting peace, and a stable, secure future for the whole region. “Today is the first, crucial phase of ending this war and now we must deliver the second phase, in full. “The UK will support the next stage of talks to ensure the full implementation of the peace plan, so that people on both sides can rebuild their lives in safety and security.” Yvette Cooper, the foreign secretary, said: “The UK has worked intensively with international partners in recent months to create the momentum that has led to President Trump’s peace initiative, and to support the ceasefire that is now in place, but we now need to work with the same intensity and urgency to develop a plan for Gaza’s recovery and reconstruction. “Gaza has been completely devastated. The ceasefire gives us the opportunity not just to urgently scale up humanitarian efforts but also to look to the future of Gaza’s recovery. Rubble must be cleared, infrastructure repaired, healthcare restored and homes rebuilt.” Speaking to the BBC on Sunday, Bridget Phillipson, the education secretary, said: “We know that we need to see a viable Palestinian state alongside a safe and secure Israel . That’s the government’s position. That’s what we want to continue to be involved in making happen and why the prime minister, Keir Starmer, is tomorrow travelling to Egypt.” Asked what part the UK had played in the ceasefire, she said: “We do have a role, but of course, the role of the US has been critical in this. We can all recognise that.” Speaking later to the BBC, Priti Patel, the shadow foreign secretary, said: “I think we have to be honest at the fact that Britain has had no role, no role whatsoever.” She added: “I think it’s extraordinary that Keir Starmer apparently is going to Egypt tomorrow when we’ve got plenty of domestic issues that he should be resolving and sorting out.”",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/oct/12/uk-to-host-international-summit-on-gaza-recovery-plan,politics,BBC,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/05db5169b643683a8fbce122f7804296b83cda85/435_100_1417_1134/master/1417.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=edb0027368d74ace55f247031b7d6ebd",2025-10-12T21:00:02+00:00,924679a4f4a29eb1fe9e44ed40fa7275b6830d0c
bf2824c76da6,"Jonathan Powell had no role in dropping of China spy case, senior minister says",,"The government’s national security adviser had no involvement in the prosecution being dropped against two British men accused of spying for China, a senior cabinet minister has said. Jonathan Powell had no connection to discussions about the “substance or the evidence” of the case, Bridget Phillipson said on Sunday, adding that Keir Starmer had full confidence in him. Powell’s role has been under intense scrutiny since it emerged that the sudden abandonment of the prosecution in September appeared to be because Starmer’s government was unwilling to say that China posed a threat to UK national security, a decision to which Powell would appear to be central. According to reports, the cases against Christopher Cash, a parliamentary researcher, and Christopher Berry, a researcher based in China, were dropped after Powell said China would not be described as an enemy in any trial – considered necessary for a successful prosecution under the Official Secrets Act. Cash and Berry deny accusations that they provided information about Westminster to China’s politburo. Under the updated national security strategy released in June, China was listed as a “geostrategic challenge” rather than an enemy. Appearing on the BBC’s Sunday With Laura Kuenssberg show, Phillipson was asked why the case had lapsed. She said: “Obviously, the Crown Prosecution Service are best placed to explain why they were not able to bring forward a prosecution, but what I can be absolutely clear about is that ministers and others, including the national security adviser, had no role to play in either the substance of the case or the evidence in question.” Speaking earlier on Sky News’s Sunday Morning With Trevor Phillips, the education secretary was asked for assurances that Powell took no part in the decision. “Yes, I can give that assurance,” Phillipson replied. “We’re very disappointed that the CPS were not able to take forward the prosecution.” Asked if the prime minister still had full confidence in Powell, she said he did. The centrality of government decision-making emerged last week when Stephen Parkinson, the director of public prosecutions, wrote to the chairs of two parliamentary select committees to say that the case was dropped after ministers and officials declined to set out that Beijing represented a “threat to the national security of the UK”, despite what he called “many months” of efforts. This is key because of case law relating to the Official Secrets Act, which emerged after Cash and Berry were charged. This, connected to the separate trial of six Bulgarian nationals found guilty of spying for Russia, clarified that under the act, a country must be a threat to the UK’s national security at the time of the offence, prompting the need for clarification from the government. Phillipson told the BBC that because some of the legal changes dated back to 2023, it was a matter for the previous Conservative government. “I’m not making a partisan point when I say this, but there was a different government in office then,” she said. Speaking on the same programme, Priti Patel, the shadow foreign secretary, said: “I’d say it’s utter nonsense and that’s a bold statement from her. I was home secretary for over three years and we were absolutely crystal clear that China was a threat, an adversary.”",https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/oct/12/jonathan-powell-no-role-dropping-china-spy-case-senior-minister-says,politics,BBC,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7c7106d5666d095a082dc707126b184e062f8535/366_57_3596_2876/master/3596.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=98234d922e2e577544a36ab9c38041fa",2025-10-12T16:26:07+00:00,f313dfcbaa6bfda95ad9aa84bbf0799c9cf31e30
c650ed8e9ace,Lucy Powell calls on Labour not to ‘write off’ May local elections,,"Labour should not “write off” next May’s elections as a likely moment for big losses but use the budget as a way to seize back voters’ attention, Lucy Powell has said as the battle to be the party’s deputy leadership entered its final period. With voting among party members under way, Bridget Phillipson , Powell’s rival for the post, said if she won she would set up a formal system to reflect the views of members and unions to the cabinet on a regular basis. Powell was sacked from the cabinet in last month’s reshuffle after the departure of Angela Rayner and has become the favourite to win on an outsider platform, promising to present tough truths to Keir Starmer and his team when necessary. Speaking after a series of events with members over the weekend, Powell said there was concern about the possible impact on the party of the elections for the Scottish and Welsh parliaments and councils across England next May, with Labour predicted to see heavy losses, many to Reform UK. Powell, who was leader of the Commons until the reshuffle, said she was “not prepared to write off this hugely important set of elections” as inevitable midterm pushback, calling for a bold budget in response. “It’s not OK if we are losing good Labour councillors and councils through no fault of their own, because of the missteps we’ve taken nationally,” she said. “We need to reset the agenda so that more communities don’t wake up to Reform and other councils after election day next May.” The 26 November budget should be “a moment to draw a line under our past mistakes, and show the country whose side we are on”, Powell said, saying it should lift the two-child benefit cap and make sure the tax burden was shared more fairly. Speaking on BBC One’s Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg, Phillipson, the education secretary, indicated she believed the cap would be lifted. “I am confident that we as a government will do the right thing by children growing up in poverty in our country,” she said. “We’ve already started that process. There’s more to do. I will make that happen.” Phillipson argued that as a cabinet minister she could make sure members’ concerns were heard directly at the top of government. In a subsequent pledge, her team said she would formally solicit views from members and trade unions every three months to present in this way. She said: “The Labour party draws its strength from its members. That’s why I want to give them a stronger voice in how the government delivers its agenda, with more avenues for our movement to tell us about their priorities. “Only under my deputy leadership will members have their voices heard loud and clear at the cabinet table.” Electronic voting among party members began last Wednesday and will run until 23 October, with the result announced two days later.",https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/oct/12/lucy-powell-calls-on-labour-not-to-write-off-may-local-elections,politics,BBC,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/76ab272bb5d2ecfbb71be150d5f8572aba021427/254_0_3099_2480/master/3099.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=636f15cf5b081eb1160cfd43ac2c4c7d",2025-10-12T16:00:21+00:00,b38b8c9a89ef79a170dcffbfb1a29dc4220c81cd
6bcca05532c9,William Hill owner says it could shut shops if Reeves raises gambling taxes,,"The debt-laden company behind William Hill is considering closing up to 200 betting shops if Rachel Reeves’s autumn budget raises taxes on the gambling sector. Evoke, formerly known as 888, which acquired William Hill in a £2bn takeover in 2022, is drawing up plans for different scenarios before expected gambling tax increases in the chancellor’s budget on 26 November. Evoke is considering shutting a number of outlets, in news first reported by the Sunday Times , which said closures could range from 120 shops to closer to 200. This would amount to between 9% and 15% of William Hill’s chain of 1,300 betting shops, with up to 1,500 jobs potentially affected. Between five and 10 people typically work in a betting shop. Evoke, which also owns the 888 and Mr Green brands, has 10,000 staff in total. The FTSE 250 company is struggling under a debt pile of £1.8bn after its largely debt-funded acquisition of William Hill, and made a pre-tax loss of nearly £78m in the first half of the year. A spokesperson for Evoke said: “We are mindful of potential tax increases in the forthcoming budget which would impact investment in the UK and drive more customers to the black market. “As part of our ongoing planning, we are assessing the potential impact of different overall tax scenarios on our UK operations. This includes the difficult but necessary consideration for shop closures.” The company stressed that no decision had been taken yet. It is the second big gambling company to warn of the impact of tax rises within a week. Stella David, the chief executive of Entain, the FTSE 100 owner of Ladbrokes and Coral, also said higher gambling taxes could lead to shop closures and investment being diverted to other countries. The government has been consulting on gambling taxation, and wants to simplify the various rates of duty applied to gambling products – a move the sector fears would raise its overall tax bill. A Treasury spokesperson said: “We are consulting on bringing online betting in line with other forms of online gambling to cut down bureaucracy. It is not about increasing or decreasing tax rates, and we welcome all views.” skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Business Today Get set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morning Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

5896dcb868dc,UK ministers take control of £10bn Lower Thames Crossing,,"Ministers have stripped the government’s road-building agency of responsibility for a £10bn tunnel under the River Thames amid a drive by Keir Starmer’s cabinet to take tight control over important infrastructure projects for fear of cost overruns and delays. Oversight of the Lower Thames Crossing – the UK’s largest planned infrastructure project – has been taken away from National Highways and handed to the Department for Transport (DfT). An artist’s impression of the Lower Thames Crossing, southern tunnel entrance. Photograph: Joas Souza/National Highways Internal consultation documents, seen by the Guardian, said the costs of the Lower Thames Crossing would be overseen by the DfT, leaving National Highways to “focus on managing, maintaining and renewing the network”. However, campaigners warned that the move could in fact lead to HS2-levels of overspending and ministers approving developments behind closed doors that would harm the environment. Treasury officials are thought to be behind the shift to centralise the management of large infrastructure projects after the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, made clear her frustration at “ bats and newts” delaying major schemes and adding to the final costs. The consultation documents showed that the “Tier 1” project – which is considered by the DfT to be “one of the largest, highest risk, novel and/or contentious” schemes now being undertaken – would be overseen by the transport secretary, Heidi Alexander . Reeves and Starmer have put planning reform at the heart of their growth plans after drafting legislation earlier this year to make it easier to build without paying as much for expensive wildlife protection . The chancellor is keen to include a number of initiatives designed to allow developers to build houses and infrastructure projects, in the hope that higher economic growth will fill about £3bn of an estimated £30bn shortfall in the Treasury’s finances. Earlier this week, Reeves was taped claiming that she had unblocked a development of 20,000 homes that was being held up by a rare snail. The new Thames crossing has received final planning consent and secured £590m for early-stage excavation, surveys and consultations. In addition, the construction firm Balfour Beatty has landed a £1.2bn contract to build roads connecting to the tunnel. However, funding for the full project has been delayed while the chancellor searches for a partner that could contribute as much as £2bn to the scheme in return for charging a toll. Work is expected to get under way before the end of the decade. The site lies east of the Dartford crossing, which takes traffic from the M25 and lorries travelling to and from the ports of Dover and Folkestone. A map showing the Lower Thames Crossing route Environmental campaigners argue that vital habitats on Kent’s north shoreline and the south Essex coast will be lost if the tunnel goes ahead. It will also increase carbon emissions without solving congestion on existing roads, they added. skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Business Today Get set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morning Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Alexander said earlier this year that the government was “finally getting on” with the crossing, adding that the “crucial project” had “been stuck in planning limbo for far too long”. National Highways has said that an extra connection between north Kent and Essex is also needed to allow for maintenance on the existing Dartford tunnels. It is understood that National Highways will remain responsible for the development of the crossing and will publish a breakdown of costs in its annual report, but decisions over the scope and funding of the project will be taken by ministers. A Department for Transport spokesperson said: “Backed by £590m, the Lower Thames Crossing is the most significant road-building project in a generation – and will cut local congestion, better link up motorists and businesses in the Midlands and north with key ports in the south-east, and spreading growth throughout the regions, as set in our plan for change.” Quick Guide Contact Guardian Business about this story Show The best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.

40c8f01a1917,SNP backs Swinney’s ‘clear’ strategy for new independence referendum,,"SNP members have overwhelmingly backed leader John Swinney’s “clear and unambiguous” independence strategy that a majority election win is the only route to another referendum. On the first day of the party’s annual conference in Aberdeen, the vast majority of members backed the leadership’s motion that next May’s Holyrood elections should be fought on a “clear platform of national independence” and that winning a majority in the Scottish parliament – by securing 65 seats or more – would be “the only uncontested way to deliver a new vote on Scotland’s future”. After a passionate – and at times highly technical – debate, the conference rejected a rebel amendment put by more than 40 local branches that set out a more fundamentalist strategy of treating next year’s election as a de facto referendum, meaning that if the SNP and other pro-independence parties win a majority of the popular vote in 2026, it should be treated as a mandate to open independence negotiations directly. This de facto idea was first promoted by the former party leader and first minister Nicola Sturgeon, who acknowledged it as a “mistake” in her recent memoir. Echoing the confidence of SNP strategists reported in the Guardian yesterday, Swinney told the packed conference hall that “we are within touching distance of the 65 seats that will make the world sit up and take notice” and urged the party to back taking a “clear, unambiguous message” to the public. Depute leader Keith Brown, who seconded the motion, told delegates: “The only way we can achieve independence is to ask a clear question and get a clear answer.” This call to clarity is key: while independence is not high on the list of voters’ priorities, activists have unhappy memories of trying to explain what many believed was a fatally muddled independence strategy on the doorstep for the general election last year, where the SNP was humiliated by the resurgent Labour party, losing 38 of its 48 Westminster seats. A year on, the party’s pivot to its core message is a mark of renewed confidence, with the SNP once again leading the polls ahead of Scottish Labour and Reform UK, and an understanding that the battleground demographic for the coming campaign is made up of those “soft yes” independence supporters who have drifted away from the party. Speaking for the de facto amendment, veteran activist Graeme McCormick insisted that it was not proposed by “romantic nationalists”. He warned that the SNP was being “hollowed out” because it had failed to inspire its membership with a date for another referendum. The former MP Tommy Sheppard said it was “remarkable” that such a large conference was able to have such a detailed discussion in public and in front of the media, but insisted there were “no quick fixes”. “We have been chasing the next election for too long,” he said, arguing that the party needed a strategy to take it into the 2030s and deepen support for independence. skip past newsletter promotion Our morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it matters Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

c0205a5d40fb,"Tony Blair met Jeffrey Epstein in No 10 on advice of Peter Mandelson, documents reveal",,"Sir Tony Blair met Jeffrey Epstein in Downing Street while he was prime minister after a recommendation by Peter Mandelson, newly released papers from the National Archives show. Epstein visited Blair on 14 May 2002, after the suggestion by Lord Mandelson to the prime minister’s then chief of staff, Jonathan Powell . Mandelson was sacked as US ambassador in September after new information emerged about how close he was to the convicted sex offender. At the time of the recommendation, Mandelson was a backbench Labour MP but still served as a trusted ally to Blair. Just over a year earlier he had resigned from government a second time amid controversy. He had described Epstein to Powell as “safe” and a “friend” in an email before the meeting. Powell is now Keir Starmer’s national security adviser. His role has been questioned in the collapse of a Chinese spying case. According to papers released to the BBC, a briefing memo by the senior civil servant Matthew Rycroft described Epstein as a friend of Mandelson and the former US president Bill Clinton, as well as being close to Prince Andrew , the Duke of York. A spokesperson for Blair said the meeting was “long before his [Epstein’s] crimes were known of and his subsequent conviction”. A government spokesperson said Powell had only forwarded the request in his role as chief of staff. Epstein pleaded guilty to soliciting prostitution from a minor in June 2008. He died in prison in 2019. The release of the documents had been blocked by government officials over concerns it may affect UK-US relations. However, the National Archives has now released the document as a result of a freedom of information request. The BBC reported that an email from Mandelson to Powell a week before the meeting said: “Do you remember when Clinton saw TB [Tony Blair] he said he wanted to introduce his travelling friend, Jeffrey Epstein, to TB? “This was frustrated – TB said at the time – in the office for reasons (he says) he was unclear about. I think TB would be interested in meeting Jeffrey, who is also a friend of mine, because Jeffrey is an active scientific catalyst/entrepreneur as well as someone who has his finger on the pulse of many worldwide markets and currencies. “He is young and vibrant. He is safe (whatever that means) and Clinton is now doing a lot of travelling with him.” Mandelson went on: “I mentioned to TB that Jeffrey is in London next week and he said he would like to meet him. skip past newsletter promotion Our morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it matters Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Can you let me know?” A later briefing by Rycroft – who went on to serve as permanent secretary at the Home Office until 2025 – on the day of the meeting said about Epstein: “He is a financial adviser to the super-rich and a property developer. He is a friend of Bill Clinton and Peter Mandelson .” He added: “The background on Epstein is that he is very rich and close to the Duke of York.” He continued: “Peter says that Epstein now travels with Clinton and Clinton wants you to meet him.” A spokesperson for Blair said: “As far as he can remember, Mr Blair met with him for less than 30 minutes in Downing Street in 2002 and discussed US and UK politics. “He never met or engaged with him subsequently. This was, of course, long before his crimes were known of and his subsequent conviction.” A government spokesperson said: “Jonathan Powell forwarded on the request, he had no further role.”",https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/oct/11/tony-blair-met-jeffrey-epstein-in-no-10-on-advice-of-peter-mandelson-documents-reveal,politics,BBC,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cb0c5d8cebe80342cf77ad8bdb1ac3c4c2bbdd88/0_107_1920_1536/master/1920.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=2d43cea75ce08f1cbcb88a5358f59094",2025-10-11T11:49:09+00:00,d18d1d163d0913d291c000771ccffd49678f3267
382d275f6695,"The Guardian view on Labour targeting nature: the problem isn’t snails, but a broken housing model",,"I t began with gastropods. Last Tuesday, the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, told a conference of tech executives that she’d intervened to help a developer build about 20,000 homes in north Sussex that had been held up, she said, by “some snails … a protected species or something”. She added that they “are microscopic … you cannot even see” them. No one could miss the direction the chancellor was headed in. The snail in question, the lesser whirlpool ramshorn, is one of Britain’s rarest freshwater creatures, found in only a handful of locations and highly sensitive to sewage pollution . But Ms Reeves portrayed it as a bureaucratic nuisance. She then bragged that she’d fixed it – after a friendly developer gave her a call. It’s a bad look for a Labour politician, let alone the chancellor, to boast that green rules can be bent for chums. The scheme was given the go-ahead a day before drought was declared in Sussex, potentially giving water companies cover to breach their licence obligations – including measures meant to protect the snails. Ms Reeves won’t like being compared to Liz Truss, but the analogy works. Three years ago, Ms Truss railed against an “anti-growth coalition” of environmentalists, lawyers and regulators who, she claimed, were blocking Britain’s path to prosperity. Ms Reeves is framing the issue the same way: growth is the priority, nature the obstacle. But the public don’t agree. Luke Tryl of More in Common told a Conservative conference fringe meeting that most Britons can’t be categorised as “ nimby ” or “ yimby ”. They want both: to build and also to protect the countryside. However, when asked whether wildlife should be protected even if it delays or raises the cost of infrastructure, every single voter group – including Labour, Conservative and Reform UK – chose wildlife. Among the general public, 62% prioritised nature protection while 18% sided with building at any cost. The Treasury reportedly plans to gut green rules with amendments to its planning and infrastructure bill – ditching the precautionary principle, slashing species protections and curbing legal challenges. The bill, currently in the Lords , already allows developers to bypass environmental obligations by paying into a fund to offset damage elsewhere. Under its “environmental delivery plans”, ministers could disapply environmental protections in exchange for vague promises of ecological improvement within 10 years. Labour, significantly, is turning its back on the work of the Dasgupta review . This argues that nature is not a constraint on growth but its foundation, a form of capital on which the economy depends. Labour is not only rejecting that view but deluding itself by claiming housebuilding will be accelerated by dismissing concerns around conservation. The Wildlife Trusts points out that more than a million homes already have planning permission since 2015, but remain unbuilt. The real barriers to housebuilding are skills shortages, hoarded land and slow delivery. They need sorting out. Blaming snails, it would seem, is easier. Many of Labour’s younger voters are already tempted by the Green party, which combines environmentalism and leftwing economics. Now, by mocking green protections and cosying up to developers, the chancellor is giving these voters more reasons to jump ship. The problem isn’t the planning system . It’s a broken, profit-driven housing model that banks land and starves supply. Scrapping nature protections won’t build 1.5m homes , it will just bulldoze public trust and the countryside.",https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/oct/12/the-guardian-view-on-labour-targeting-nature-the-problem-isnt-snails-but-a-broken-housing-model,politics,BBC,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/33d22c32e1b9889c35a88e06ee05667588a092dd/329_0_4304_3442/master/4304.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=2e9683e3222c856e2225a65397fff8c7",2025-10-12T16:30:56+00:00,9af80332755b16e08e499dc65da5d37ab2ecb960
18fae14c0868,France is not alone in its crisis of political faith – belief in a democratic world is vanishing,,"E mmanuel Macron sounded like a man in grief. Not angry, not defiant, just a little triste . Europe, he lamented, was suffering a “ degeneration of democracy ”. Many threats emanated from outside, from Russia, from China, from powerful US tech companies and social-media entrepreneurs, France’s president said. “But we should not be naive. On the inside we are turning on ourselves. We doubt our own democracy … We see everywhere that something is happening to our democratic fabric. Democratic debate is turning into a debate of hatred.” Squeezed between vituperative extremes of right and left, Macron knows of what he speaks. But “ungovernable” France is not alone in its bitter, intractable divisions . Across Europe, in the UK and the US, distrust and grievance daily deepen political dysfunction and social discord. Macron’s words apply, in fact, to almost any country espousing democratic principles. Belief that democracy is the form of governance best suited to the modern world is dwindling, especially among younger people . Meanwhile, the public space grows coarser and more violent. Macron was speaking at an event marking the 35th anniversary of Germany’s 1990 reunification, a moment of great optimism. Yet, like France, today’s polarised Germany faces an acute crisis of political faith. Just look around. In elections last weekend, the Czech Republic followed Poland, Austria and other EU states in lurching towards the populist hard right, swept along on a rising tide of anti-establishment negativity. Support for opportunistic bigots who feed on fear, resentment and loss – while lacking credible policies on complex issues such as migration – is not an endorsement of democracy but its despoliation. This ugly rush to extremes is a vote of no confidence in the democratic system itself, exacerbated by reduced levels of participation and turnout among disadvantaged social groups. In all these countries, a national democratic consensus is woefully lacking. In declining, despairing Britain, where national flags are worn like comfort blankets, both leading mainstream parties are flailing; yet the alternatives are implausible or downright pernicious. In the US, the “home of democracy”, effective opposition to Republican one-party rule has all but collapsed, at least at national level. Striving to gerrymander congressional districts , Donald Trump increasingly resembles a dictator. Lack of genuine democratic choice and economic opportunity, fuelling alienation and revolt, beset countries as diverse as Morocco , Kenya and Bangladesh , all of which have witnessed recent upheavals. In the Philippines, Nigeria, Turkey, Indonesia and Madagascar, corruption and abuse of power have triggered anti-government protests. In Nepal last month, young people powered a “gen-Z revolution”. All these countries, in Europe and beyond, are different – except in one vital respect. Compared with authoritarian regimes such as China and Russia, their societies remain relatively open and free, for now. This is the fundamental challenge each faces: democracy isn’t working, or it is working so badly it risks being jettisoned. The once exemplary US – a paradigm lost – and fractious western Europe are faltering. And once again, less established democracies in the global south, and in central and eastern Europe, are frontline states in a reviving cold war of influence and values fought against the Beijing-Moscow axis. Like Moldova and Georgia , to name two recent battlegrounds, they could go either way. A crunch is coming. In its annual report, Freedom House, the US-based rights watchdog, found that violence, poll manipulation and repression marred more than 40% of national elections held in 2024. Global freedom, assessed in terms of political liberties and civil rights, declined for a 19th consecutive year. “Conflicts spread instability and thwarted democratic progress around the world,” the report concluded. In the US, a recent survey found a record 64% of Americans believe their democracy “is too politically divided to solve the nation’s problems”. In the UK, a poll of people aged 16-29 found 63% think democracy is in trouble . While young people “preferred to live in a democracy over a dictatorship by 57% to 27%”, only 35% said they would consider getting involved in organised politics. skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Matters of Opinion Guardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and more Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Short- and long-term economic issues – the cost of living, inflation, lack of good jobs, de-industrialisation, shattered communities, institutional failures, wealth inequality, globalisation, mass migration linked to the climate crisis, the busted myth of infinitely sustainable growth – are all factors. Untrustworthy leaders, reflecting falling moral standards, is another. Insidious election meddling and online fakery by Russia and others hasten breakdown. Younger generations are pitted against ageing populations. And there is hopelessness, as well as anger, about the mess the world is in, environmentally and geopolitically. For Andreas Reckwitz of Humboldt University of Berlin, all this discontent is rooted in an overall, profound and ubiquitous sense of loss. “Western modernity’s foundational lie” – the post-Enlightenment belief that human progress is constant and inevitable, that everything gets better over time, that life improves – has been brutally exploded by the experience of recent decades, Reckwitz argues . “Loss has become a pervasive condition of life … The question is no longer whether loss can be avoided but whether societies bound to ‘better’ or ‘more’ can learn to endure ‘less’ and ‘worse’.” Seen this way, rejection of failing democratic structures and the advance of demagogic throwbacks pledging a return to “the way things were” are more easily understood. “If politics continues to promise endless improvement, it will fuel disillusionment and strengthen populisms that thrive on betrayed expectations,” Reckwitz writes. “Populism channels anger over what has disappeared but provides only illusions of recovery. The crucial question then becomes: how to deal with loss?” Reckwitz has his own suggestions, involving resilience and redistribution. If anyone has a definitive answer, Macron, with much to lose, would surely love to hear it.",https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/oct/12/france-crisis-political-faith-belief-democratic-world-vanishing,politics,BBC,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5622669477b5eae1034bdd5e7b06e606031d3067/404_0_4492_3593/master/4492.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=c1d471c87aa33813482b70b453549c64",2025-10-12T05:00:42+00:00,2133eefdc3204ea52dee6e4981014d6e78b6ca47
286be389b0af,Don’t fall for the authoritarian hype – Reform and the hard right can be stopped in their tracks,,"N igel Farage portrays his Reform UK party as a unique phenomenon that has burst on to the global stage, its meteoric rise an exceptional epochal event. But this week, in every one of Europe’s major countries and from India and Thailand to the US and Argentina, hard-right, anti-immigrant, anti-globalisation parties like his are also ahead in the opinion polls. In last Saturday’s Czech elections, the rightwing, pro-Putin populist Andrej Babiš toppled prime minister Petr Fiala. National Rally , which has just brought down yet another French prime minister , is leading the polls for both the French presidency and parliament. In Germany, the far-right Alternative für Deutschland (AfD) is currently the most popular party. Hungary’s Fidesz party, Robert Fico’s pro-Russian Slovakian coalition and the Brothers of Italy are already in government, while the Freedom party of Austria (FPÖ), the Netherlands’ Freedom party (PVV) and Belgium’s Vlaams Belang – all hardline nationalists – are part of an international coalition of anti-internationalists, inspired by far-right propagandists like Steve Bannon , seeking to dethrone the international rule of law, diminish human rights and destroy multilateral cooperation. The populist nationalist surge exposes a new and unavoidable truth that democrats ignore at our peril: an authoritarian ethnic nationalism – once thought toppled with the Berlin Wall – has replaced neoliberalism as the dominant ideology of our age, giving us a world of firsts: “America first”, “India first”, “China first”, “Russia first”, “my tribe first” and often “my tribe first and only” regimes. It is this ethnic nationalism that helps explain why the world is now composed of 91 autocracies and only 88 democracies , and ethnic nationalism is the force behind the violations of international human rights law not just by Russia in Ukraine but in almost every one of the world’s 59 cross-border conflicts and civil wars. It is important to understand the underlying forces, common to almost every country, that have fuelled this new age of nationalism. It starts with a widely felt sense that a globalisation that was open but not inclusive has been a free for all that has not been fair to all. For more than a decade, leaders have not only been slow to respond to the millions who feel left out and left behind, but also to the changing balance of global economic power, moving us from a unipolar world once dominated by the US to a multipolar world of competing superpowers, and from a rules-based order to a power-based one. The ethnic nationalism that this has incited means free trade is giving way to protectionism. Where economics used to drive politics, the politics of nationalism is now driving economic decisions, and already more than 100 countries are running mercantilist policies marked out by reshoring and friend-shoring and by bans on cross-border trade, investment and technology transfer, sinking international cooperation to its lowest ebb since 1945. But all is not lost. The cement is still wet, and even as it hardens we can find hope in the common sense of the global public. In a survey by Focaldata , of 36,000 people in 34 countries we find a clear majority are more resistant to an exclusionary nationalism and more willing to embrace international cooperation than many of the leaders who rule over them. Across the world there is, perhaps surprisingly, only a small group of hardened anti-internationalists representing 16.5% of the global population (even if 25% in today’s US) who either feel coexistence between ethnic and religious groups is impossible or have a zero-sum mindset that if they or their country do well, it has to be at the expense of others doing badly. But there are another 21% at the opposite extreme, whom we might call committed internationalists, who either still see cooperation across borders through open trade as a positive sum win-win, or are what the US philosopher and writer Kwame Anthony Appiah calls “rooted cosmopolitans”. Nigel Farage 'doesn't like Britain': Keir Starmer takes dig at Reform leader – video The vast majority of the global public are somewhere in between: not narrow, inward-looking nationalists, as “America first” ideology would suggest, or all-in cosmopolitans. They are patriotic but don’t see the world as in a never-ending struggle between the “us” and the “them”, adversaries permanently set apart from each other in an unbridgeable divide. Do the majority in the middle prefer a duty-free or a dutiful world? Are they prepared to accept obligations beyond their garden gate or city wall? Yes, under certain conditions. A first group, 22%, will back humanitarian action to relieve suffering and are prepared to act out of altruism, supporting emergency help for disaster zones. Those we might call “good cause” multilateralists feel the pain of others and believe in something bigger than themselves. A second group comprising 22% are pragmatic multilateralists who want to know that any taxes paid out for international development are spent well. And there is a third group, 21%, self-interested multilateralists, who will endorse cooperation if they can see that it benefits them and their communities, whether it be through guaranteeing them food on the table or peace and security. So a clear majority can be constructed not just for humanitarian aid if money is well spent but also for global action to deal with global problems, like climate crisis and pandemic prevention, as long as this case is argued on grounds of enlightened self-interest, and if we stress the reciprocal benefits that flow to them and their own country. And thus for those who have long wondered whether we cooperate out of need or if we have a need to cooperate, the answer is both. skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Matters of Opinion Guardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and more Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

And while in-depth polls tell us that across the west, illegal immigration is currently the biggest national issue – and no one should doubt that it must quickly be brought under control – the snapshots of opinion also tell us that the public are even more concerned about what is happening in their own lives and within their own local communities. Last month, Keir Starmer spoke movingly about how what’s good about Britain can drive out what’s bad, doing so precisely because in most western countries, “broken” and “in decline” are the words people have for years most commonly cited when asked about both our economy and society. But as the prime minister also reminded us, the far right is more interested in exploiting grievances than ending them. Farage hailed Liz Truss’s disastrous mini-budget as “ the best Conservative budget since 1986 ”. But he would also enact Truss act two – what she planned to deliver – the biggest ever cuts in public services. Reform’s plan to reduce public spending by £275bn would not repair downtrodden communities but ravage them, turn citizen against citizen and wreck any spirit of solidarity. Under a Farage hard-right regime, you will not be able to afford to be sick, disabled, poor or vulnerable. Every day from now on, and in every constituency, Reform should be asked which hospital, which school and which public service will be the first to be cut or closed. “Faragism” is neoliberalism at its most inhumane, more destructive even than monetarism, and vindictive far beyond austerity. What the public are telling us all over the west is that they want their governments to rebuild our economies and our civic societies . “Reform” and its global allies should be exposed day after day for policies that would devastate both. And for those of us who believe our best days could be ahead of us, we can go beyond highlighting Reform’s hypocrisy by setting out a case for a better Britain that appeals not just to idealists, but to pragmatists, to self-interest, and to the everyday compassion of the British people.",https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/oct/11/reform-nigel-farage-hard-right-politics-gordon-brown-labour,politics,BBC,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/47f88d36ac4c240f8bd0bb64e9786d1fd1839191/1122_0_6436_5151/master/6436.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=febc73ddb146d4cbf657336b940b2883",2025-10-11T09:00:20+00:00,6ff5a86b90109092b817a5bde8dd5cccc005e2a1
3a023e18e83e,Why should you be Labour’s next deputy leader? Guardian readers quiz the candidates,,"What would you do to tackle the cost of living crisis that has ravaged working-class communities? Stephen Heinson , Cardiff Bridget Phillipson: I wouldn’t be here without Labour governments. They spurred me on my journey from a tough council street in the north-east all the way to the cabinet. We had no heating upstairs when I was growing up, and we struggled with damp. But that story’s not unique: it’s shared by so many working people across Britain. That’s why I have been fighting for changes that will make a difference to working families. Such as reviving Sure Start for a new generation, funding childcare from nine months old, rolling out free breakfast clubs, expanding free school meals for half a million more children and capping the branded items schools can require. Together these changes save working-class families thousands of pounds. As co-chair of the Child Poverty Taskforce, I am clear everything is on the table, including removing the two-child limit. As deputy leader I would continue fighting for policies that change the lives of working people: investment in public services, ensuring the full delivery of our employment rights bill so people get fair pay for a fair day’s work – change that makes Labour members proud of this government, proud to campaign, proud to win again. Lucy Powell: The cost of living crisis, Covid, austerity and the global financial crisis have all hit working-class communities hardest. Each has deepened inequalities in class, region, education and opportunity. Addressing this is what this Labour government is about. We have an economy that serves the few, not the many – a “trickle-down” model that needs rewiring. I want to see a much stronger sense that tackling economic inequality and fairness unites everything we do. That’s one of the reasons I strongly support lifting the two-child benefit cap at the forthcoming budget, looking at Gordon Brown’s measures on gambling taxes to pay for it. As deputy, I would help to seize back the political megaphone to set the terms of the debate, being clear about what we are doing to reshape the economy in the interests of working-class communities – buses and trains back in public hands, a new energy company, GB Energy, owned by us all, more dignity and security in work and at home with the employment bill and renters rights bill. The job of the deputy leader isn’t to write a separate budget or policy programme but to ensure that our values shine through, and what we are doing is rooted in the communities we are here to serve. Stephen Heinson: Sadly, neither candidate seems able to acknowledge that the cost of living crisis is really a crisis of our failed economic model. There’s a direct link between declining living standards and unrestrained corporate greed: the private energy companies skimming off huge profits from ballooning household bills, for instance, or the property developers and letting agents cashing in on renters’ misery in a broken housing market. Tackling this crisis meaningfully would mean defying the corporate interests of Labour’s CEO donors. How are you going to address the rise of the far right in this country? Dominique Sandring , London BP: The Labour movement has been defined for generations by our core values – solidarity, compassion, fairness and social justice. As deputy leader, I’d campaign with hope and optimism, underpinned always by those Labour values that mean so much to our members. We should be proud of our values – proud to stand up for them, never ashamed of them. The far right feeds off fear and negativity, exploiting the struggles of people across the country and offering false solutions and empty promises. Let me be clear: we won’t win by parroting the language of Reform UK and Nigel Farage. We are Labour and we must govern, campaign, and win as Labour. We must deliver on the change that we promised voters so we can build the society we all want to see. That means expanding free school meals, renewing Sure Start and reforming employment rights to make work pay. It is only a united Labour party, the greatest vehicle for social justice this country has ever seen, that can deliver real change in our communities and country. LP: Fighting the forces of division and hate is the challenge of our age. The future of our democracy depends on us winning the battle of hearts and minds, showing that mainstream progressive politics is a force for change. We’ve got to up our game. As deputy leader I would help Labour do that. We shouldn’t try to out-Reform Reform UK. Nigel Farage wants the country to believe that immigrants are the root cause of all our problems. I wholeheartedly reject that. Yes, we need secure and strong borders as a foundation of a secure and fair country, but the reasons for deep-seated inequalities go much deeper. We need to seize back the political megaphone and set out far more strongly our diagnosis of what is really wrong with this country, and what Labour is doing to fix it. We have an economy that hasn’t worked for ordinary people for decades. From Margaret Thatcher to austerity, Covid and the energy crisis, those with wealth and assets have done well. For everyone else, life has got harder and less secure. We need to show that every single thing we are doing is in service of addressing this – to tell our own story about how we’re fixing the real problems. Dominique Standring: Reading the answers side by side, my sense is that Lucy Powell has answered the question better in that she has identified that Reform are winning the battle of hearts and minds – and that Labour’s message is not cutting through. Bridget Phillipson talks of Labour’s values being “solidarity, compassion, fairness, and social justice”, but I have not seen much evidence of this with the Labour government: from its stance on family reunification for those with visas to the genocide in Gaza and focus on ID cards. Crucially, neither of them have answered the “how” part of my question in any detail. Why isn’t Labour adopting a wealth tax? Can you give an example of a country where such a tax has been successful? Norma Spark , London BP: I’ve always believed in progressive taxation – it’s at the core of building a fairer and more equal society. The nature of our economy has been changing, with more people earning money from the wealth they hold; we have started to address that through the changes on carried interest, by increasing capital gains tax. And of course through non-dom reforms – you can’t simply be allowed to opt out of paying your fair share. It’s right that we all pay a fair share to deliver a better public realm, and that the broadest shoulders carry the greater burden. In government, I’ve put those values into action already, taking on the private school lobby to end tax breaks so we can invest in state education. I’ve been pilloried for it across the rightwing press, but I’ll never back down on that. I’m not afraid to take on vested interests to improve public services. The chancellor sets and makes our policies on taxation, but with a seat at the cabinet table and as deputy leader, I’d be relentlessly focused on pushing for more investment in public services so we can fix the foundations of our society and give everyone the best chance in life. LP: Let’s be honest, we need to tell a much stronger story about fairness and addressing inequalities, and whose side we are on. That must run through everything we do, including the budget. We have an economy in which those with assets and wealth do very well, yet for ordinary working people or those on fixed incomes, life has got harder and harder. Turning that round should be at the core of what this – and any – Labour government is about. That’s why I’ve been clear that the two-child benefit cap needs to be lifted. It’s also why we need to recognise how trust in us has been damaged by mistakes on the winter fuel allowance and proposed cuts to Pip. These measures did not seem fair. We need to give a much clearer sense of whose side we are on – and in whose interests we are governing. It’s not my job to write the budget, but it will be my job to ensure that what we do is connected with the views and experiences of our broad movement and the communities we seek to serve. Norma Spark: Bridget Phillipson cites steps the Labour government has taken or is taking to address tax inequity – all of which I applaud, but I hope Labour can be bolder. Lucy Powell recognises the need for Labour to “tell a better story” and acknowledge the mistakes it has made. This doesn’t address the benefits or pitfalls of a wealth tax. Last year, the G20 leaders agreed to engage cooperatively to ensure high net-worth individuals are effectively taxed. Neil Kinnock advocates an annual wealth tax of 2% on people with wealth of more than £10m. And Gordon Brown is advocating raising tax on the UK gambling industry to lift 500,000 children out of poverty. Though the deputy leader of the Labour party does not set the budget, they do have an important seat at the table. In advocating for options for a wealth tax, both candidates could signal their commitment to a more equitable and fair society and tell a good story! Would you tell Keir Starmer some home truths about policy, about sidelining the north-west – and about his perceived arrogance? Lee Stringfellow , Bury BP: I know this government has made mistakes – I won’t pretend otherwise, but I will promote our achievements. I have fought for policies that are true to Labour values – investing in state education by ending private schools’ tax breaks, reviving Sure Start, rolling out free breakfast clubs. I have argued for policies true to my values, to Labour’s values, and I worked with Angela Rayner doing the same. She challenged us as ministers to always go further for working people, to be impatient for the change they deserve. With my own mandate as deputy leader, I would continue that role. But I absolutely refuse to pit one area of our country against another. It’s the role of the deputy leader to bring all the parts of our party together, from every corner of our country. Last year I campaigned up and down the country to get Labour candidates elected, I’ve not stopped as education secretary and I won’t stop as deputy leader. With local elections and elections in Wales and Scotland around the corner, the role is going to be more important than ever. LP: This isn’t about personalities, it’s about how we use power effectively after 14 years out of government, and we have some achievements to shout about. The problem is they are being drowned out by unforced errors. Anyone who knows me knows I’m a straight talker, unafraid to be an honest voice. I told home truths on welfare, and maybe it wasn’t well received, but it won’t stop me speaking truth to power. But I won’t snipe from the sidelines or take to the airwaves. Discussion isn’t dissent – it’s vital if we’re to rebuild our electoral coalition. I really want this government to succeed. With the mandate of members I would have a strong, independent role, outside but alongside government. It’s a responsibility I would take very seriously and use wisely, but I think it’s self-evident that we can do better. There’s been too much groupthink, disconnected from the voices, talents and experiences of all of our broad movement, which is Labour’s strength. I’ll be that bridge with our members and elected representatives, pushing us all to be the best version of a Labour government we can be. Lee Stringfellow: All Bridget Phillipson has done with her answer is given a response Starmer would want me to hear. She has zero credibility as a serving minister to fight against the wrong decisions and actually listen to members. As for Lucy Powell: what is wrong with a little discord and actually saying what you believe – and indeed, what the party members and voters believe? This government has tied itself in knots with its no-sense fiscal rules and left itself with little room to manoeuvre; and all the while, who suffers? Normal taxpayers. We are heading for electoral oblivion sooner than we think if we do not grasp the nettle this year with some zinger policies that outflank Reform. Powell answered the better of the two – but I suspect Starmer will sideline her. Thanks for your answers, but this longtime Labour voter is now considering the Lib Dems. Why isn’t the government considering rejoining the customs union? What will you do to convince Starmer to see sense? Toby Hannam , Bristol BP: Back in 2016 I argued that Brexit would inflict serious economic damage on areas such as Sunderland. No part of the UK had more at stake than the north-east of England. That’s why I campaigned for remain and was one of the first MPs to call for a second referendum on the details of the deal. But those decisions are in the past – we need to focus on the future. What businesses need most now is certainty to drive economic growth and stability. The progress we have made securing an SPS trade deal with the EU is essential for British businesses, as are the protections secured for British steel. In my own portfolio we’re working on opportunities to once again boost educational exchange through schemes like Erasmus+, but of course there is more to do. I will say that I think we need to change this debate and challenge toxicity. Reform are far too happy to whip up anger about immigration, and I won’t do it. My family came to Britain as immigrants, and our story is shared across this country. I want to campaign and win on Labour values, not use the language of Reform. LP: I voted remain, and worked cross-party during the Brexit years on a proposal called Common Market 2.0, because I felt strongly that we needed to respect the outcome of the referendum, even though it was not what I voted for. One of the main reasons why we ended up with Boris Johnson as prime minister and a hard Brexit, losing so much of the so-called red wall, is because we didn’t listen and accept that a majority voted to leave and wanted Brexit. We shouldn’t reopen old wounds but focus on how we can make that botched Brexit deal better so ordinary people can feel the benefits – whether that’s action on e-gates to ease travel, closer ties on goods to lower food prices, or joint action on defence, security and irregular migration. People voted for Brexit, they voted for Johnson – and they voted for us in 2024 because they want change: more control over their lives and an economy that works for them, not just those at the top. The most important thing now is that we deliver the change people voted for. Toby Hannam: This is very much the party line response. The fact is we are willingly economically harming ourselves with the appalling deal Johnson and David Frost made. This idea that nothing can be done is symptomatic of the utter capitulation Labour have allowed. They’re too frightened to go near the issue due to the howling of the press and Reform – even when the benefits to the country are so clear. The deals that the government have obtained in office are such small beer. Other countries use the customs union and are not in the EU. Personally I would rejoin tomorrow. Without the significant improvement that the customs union could bring, our economy will continue to stumble on anaemically. The massive rebuilding that Labour wants to achieve won’t happen because they need at least another term. Why doesn’t Labour commit to building council houses? Sarah Woods , North Yorkshire BP: Labour’s £39bn social and affordable homes programme aims to deliver 300,000 new homes, 60% of them, or 180,000, for social rent – including new council homes. This is six times more than delivered in the past decade. It’s the biggest increase to social housing in a generation. I grew up in a council house in Washington, Sunderland, raised by a single mother and reliant on free school meals. I know first-hand the importance of council housing. Angela Rayner’s sense of the urgency of this was exceptional – she knew, as I do, that children need secure, warm, dry and safe homes in order to have the childhood and the opportunities all of us deserve. The changes Angela announced to the right to buy scheme – protecting existing social housing stock to meet housing need and delivering a fairer, more sustainable scheme – are essential. Councils will be able to retain 100% of receipts from the sale of right to buy so it can be invested in delivering more social homes. I’ve secured more than £600m to boost construction skills to ensure we have the workers we need to build housing – including introducing new construction technical excellence colleges in each region of the country. LP: We have committed to building more council housing – the biggest such commitment in a generation. Maybe people don’t hear enough about the good things Labour are doing, and that’s something I will seek to put right. The legacy Angela Rayner leaves on housing is a great one. As well as being a colleague and friend, I saw up close what an effective minister she was. More social homes, changes to right to buy so we don’t lose as much stock as we have been doing, a massive housebuilding programme and much more. Having a secure home is the bedrock of everything. In government I led on legislation, and I was proud we included a strengthened renters rights bill in the king’s speech. Sarah Woods: Bridget Phillipson has helpfully provided figures, but this raises further questions. The social and affordable homes programme has a 2035 horizon. Is the intention to build 18,000 council houses a year? According to Shelter England, as of 2023-24, there are 1.33m households on the social housing waiting list. In that year, their figures show a net loss of homes for social rent of 650. I am very glad to hear of the changes to protect existing stock from right to buy, but there will still be a loss through housing stock deterioration. Unfortunately, a considerable “Brexit benefit” was to lose free movement of workers, leaving a hole in construction capacity. It is good to see that Bridget Phillipson has secured funds to boost construction skills. However, this doesn’t deal with the immediate problem. Lucy Powell raises a very valid point on Labour’s messaging. I would like to see clearer messaging – Green party leader Zack Polanski is a breath of fresh air, showing how it’s done. Both candidates agree on the importance of a secure home. My husband and many of my schoolfriends were raised in council housing. The costs to this country from the failure of successive governments to replenish this asset are immense. A Labour government should be building with the rapidity of the 1950s, when 200,000 council houses were built annually. Do the candidates agree that reports that Earth’s carbon sinks are failing should be a turning point for humanity? Sigurdur Bennett , Edinburgh BP: The climate crisis is the biggest challenge facing humanity. I’m proud of the strong climate action this Labour government has taken to bring down emissions, showing leadership on a global stage. The weakening of the global consensus on the urgency of climate action is profoundly troubling, and Labour must continue to show that leadership. This is another example of where I’ll be ensuring we stay true to our values. I want the world of tomorrow to be a world worth living in, not a planet on fire, and the responsibility falls to us to make that happen today. We’re already seeing the effects of global warming – wildfires, failing carbon sinks , flooding. But with decisive action it’s not too late to turn things around. We simply must not let ourselves be blown off course by climate deniers and opponents criticising our vital net zero policies. LP: We have a strong agenda on the environment, and I’m proud to have Ed Miliband’s backing to be the next deputy leader. Ensuring there’s a just transition, tackling the climate crisis and achieving clean power by 2030 is a huge task, but one that Labour is up for. It’s not the job of the deputy leader to write an alternative policy manifesto – we were just elected with a strong programme on climate and nature. As deputy leader I would make sure that Labour is shouting about what we’re doing to improve our environment and motor ahead to net zero – and call out the backwards policies of Reform and the Tories, which would cost jobs and investment and worsen the climate and nature crisis. Sigurdur Bennett: Repeated failure of Earth’s carbon sinks now seems to be a serious possibility, which is frightening. Not that you’d know it from the candidates’ responses. Which might explain why the government may incentivise further North Sea oil drilling. What can you say about such an initiative? Only that it’s insane.",https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/oct/11/labour-next-deputy-leader-guardian-readers-debate-candidates,politics,BBC,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f18fb58e2c2ef78ea0b9d13f50db22de3c0ab58b/0_0_5000_4000/master/5000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=3ffbfe5e9808e6351591b10b93b69e6e",2025-10-11T05:00:18+00:00,ac7243c733be1ce3488a88d65af462b9e24ddcd2
d2390a6c3cd3,English democracy relies on local councillors. So why are so many facing the axe?,,"I t’s extraordinary that a profound reshaping – and shrinking – of our democracy is happening under our noses, and virtually no one notices. For baffling reasons, soon after the general election a government with a sky-high in-tray of problems embarked on a gigantic local council reorganisation no one knew about. It didn’t feature in the manifesto, nor in the local government secretary Steve Reed’s conference speech last week – but England has plans to axe unknown numbers of local councillors – some estimates put it at nearly 90%. The white paper outlining these plans actually boasts that there will be “fewer local politicians”, pandering disgracefully to the general scorn for politics. Yet voters trust councillors twice as much as they do Westminister politicians. For all the talk of localism and connecting to neighbourhoods, these are the unheralded foot soldiers of democracy. It is councillors who run political parties and much that binds their communities . Few people ever join political parties, yet the whole tottering democratic system relies entirely on those who do. Running the council and becoming a councillor is part of party members’ purpose and motivation. Abolishing so many will diminish democratic engagement over time. Many councils will be ordered to merge into unitary councils to serve a population of at least 500,000 , to deliver all local services; this will entail the abolition of hosts of district councils. (There is some “flexibility” for some with populations of fewer than 300,000.) Some won’t go quietly. Some submit alternative plans, grouping together so more of them survive. County councils, the winners from enlargement, strongly support the plan: today they launched a salvo urging the government to plough on and block their ears to the districts’ counter-plans. The budget approaches, a wretched brew of hard choices whichever way the chancellor turns. On all sides the beleaguered government faces bereft public services in need of money. The plight of councils is particularly serious: there is no money for social care’s escalating needs, Send children or the rising numbers being taken into care. There were smirks all round from other parties when Kent council, one of many captured by Reform, had to backtrack on nonsense promises for cutting of waste and taxes in its array of unicorn policies: within months Kent and the others declared defeat, finding few “net zero” and “equality” savings; it is likely to raise council tax by the maximum 5%. Council budgets have dwindled sharply as a proportion of all spending says Prof Tony Travers, local government expert at the London School of Economics, and now councils’ democratic voice will shrink too. Hoping to save money with fewer councils “rationalised” under larger unitaries means some will be enormous. North Yorkshire will be a three-hour drive across; forget delivery close to home. Is there a perfectly efficient size of council? “No,” says Travers. “There’s no evidence that Hampshire, with its district councils, is better or worse governed than say, Shropshire or Buckinghamshire unitaries.” Will this save money? House of Commons library research finds : “It is not clear from available evidence whether unitary councils save money compared with a two-tier system.” Portsmouth, one of the many towns and cities resisting , protests that its 208,000 population is an adequate size: it already delivers all services well, has no debts, and no wish to be swallowed by Hampshire. Susan Brown, Labour leader of Oxford city council with 166,000 people, is struggling to avoid being eaten by Oxfordshire into a monster council unitary of 750,000. She tells me she’s bidding to enlarge the city’s border to include its green belt, and become a unitary controlling all their services. All these boundaries will be marked out finally next March by the minister. Does anyone care much, when most are clueless about what councils do and few vote in local elections? Well they may sit up and take notice when it dawns on them that Ipswich, Norwich, Exeter, Reading and many more ancient towns and cities will be devoured by mega-county councils that feel distant, not local at all. It may dawn on Labour MPs that this is a reverse gerrymander, damaging parties of the left. Many of these lost town councils have been little islands of Liberal Democrat yellow and Labour red, amid deep blue counties, which will now outvote them. Besides, Reform will sweep through quite a lot more next May. Don’t lose these small strongholds. Britain already has fewer elected representatives than European countries of a similar size, says Travers. Cavalier map planners at Westminster never consider how reorganisations cause huge waste of time and effort. Council CEOs complain of time spent on this, amid all their other crises. What to do about contracts when the council may no longer be there? Who wants to absorb Thurrock with its £1bn debt ? Oxfordshire county council just signed an eight-year highways contract : can that be unpicked if Susan Brown of Oxford city gets her way? skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Matters of Opinion Guardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and more Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

efbbc07815b4,We all know Brexit’s to blame for the crisis facing UK steel – it’s time for politicians to be honest and reverse it,,"W hile Keir Starmer fiddles in India , Rome burns. The British steel industry now faces a calamity so severe, insiders say it could be “terminal”. The vast majority – 80% – of its exports go to the EU , which this week revealed plans to cut tariff-free steel import quotas by almost half. The remainder will be subject to a 50% tariff. The UK steel industry will be butchered. Thank you, EU. Thank you, Brexit. Whenever I meet politicians who championed Brexit nowadays, I ask them a simple question: do you still think you were right? A few fools mutter, “Yes, on balance” and “In the long term, perhaps.” The honest ones shrug and look uncomfortable. We can all accept that some day a new generation of British politicians will resume open trade across the Channel. It is normal for an island, and makes sense. So I ask the honest ones: why not go public? Make a headline, stand up, apologise and get the ball rolling? None has done so. In May, Starmer timidly negotiated a “Brexit reset” with Brussels. This injected pockets of sanity into increasingly chaotic border controls, especially on food. A few more EU students whom Brexit had crassly restricted may be admitted, along with a new e-gate for passport entry. There must still be checks – they start rolling out from this Sunday – to enforce the rule limiting Britons to no more than 90 out of any 180 days inside the Schengen area . Further resets are mooted in coming years. According to the thinktank UK in a Changing Europe, most industries just cannot wait. They are struggling to keep open markets, and if necessary realign themselves with the EU by the back door. The chemicals industry exports more than 60% of its output to the EU. Brexiteers boasted it would be liberated from EU regulation, but setting up the UK’s own regulator cost £2bn and has not worked. According to the Chemical Industries Association, output has fallen by 35-40% since 2021. Between 2021 and 2023, British exports to the EU fell by a serious 27% . Brexiteers boasted that leaving the EU would be worth hundreds of billions a year. Cambridge Econometrics estimates that over the next decade Britain’s economy will be £300bn smaller than if we had not left the EU. This is self-harm on a heroic scale. What matters is how to scramble out of the pit. For most politicians, Brexit was never a policy priority. It was a leadership stunt, conducted with the grain of Britain’s shambolic political climate in the mid-to-late 2010s. Parliament enacted what a majority of members on all sides of the Commons knew was wrong. Worse still, when a soft Brexit was a feasible least-bad option, the Labour party failed to unite with anti-Brexit Tories to retain trading links with Europe. A hugely critical national issue sank into a swamp of parliamentary infighting, on a level approaching that now being repeated in Paris . The excuse was that the public wanted it. There is no such excuse now. Voters have had the courage to look at the facts and admit the mistake. According to YouGov, 61% have concluded that Brexit is a failure. Just 13% now regard it as more of a success. Almost half want another referendum within five years, and 63% oppose loosening ties with the EU any further. That figure should daub every public meeting staged by Nigel Farage. The need is urgent for some coalition of politicians to take the lead and state baldly that Brexit was an error. Of the many failings of parliament, its inability to rise to the occasion above party politics is the most glaring. Britain’s re-entry into some trading relationship with Europe should now be the subject of a crossparty forum or select committee. They should press Starmer towards an urgent and concerted bid to reassociate with the EU. It will not be cheap, but it will be worth it. The leadership of the Tory party may find it hard to get its head round the necessary U-turn. That is tough. Its failure to explain or justify other aspects of its performance in government is already not serving it well. To accuse Starmer last May of “betrayal” and “surrender” over his EU deal was idiotic. There must be Tories who know the truth: honest politicians who follow Keynes’ purported advice and allow circumstances to alter their views. At present, as with anti-Trump Republicans in the US, the question is, when do they have the guts to surface? The public is clearly ready to see Brexit reversed. There cannot be a single industry that would oppose it. The need is for leadership. This should not be a partisan matter, except insofar as it might isolate Farage’s Reform party – and perhaps be his undoing. It should become a consensus. Of course it will not be easy. But it will be right. skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Matters of Opinion Guardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and more Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

d7609ad3a0d2,I saw desperation at the Tory conference – but all traditional parties may be in this position soon,,"M uch of democratic politics is about getting people’s attention. That’s a particular problem for struggling, less-than-compelling leaders. The further your party falls in the polls, the larger the temptation to launch dramatic, supposedly transformational policies. It’s like speaking more and more loudly to someone who has stopped listening. Thus this week’s Conservative conference in Manchester, with the party at historic lows in the polls, featured a frenzy of policy announcements, on once-successful Tory themes such as tax cuts, law and order, welfare and immigration, that were often made to half-empty rooms. Expanses of blue carpet had been installed in the huge, barn-like convention centre – as if to reassure delegates that the party still had an identity – yet much of the time they were eerily deserted. The Conservatives, famed and feared for their durability, seem to be disappearing before our eyes. Their current crisis, probably their worst ever, is not just one of popularity; but of leadership, political positioning, ideology and credibility. Within a few minutes of arriving at the conference, I overheard two delegates, both suited Tory Boys of the kind that traditionally express total confidence, having a conversation that would become very familiar, away from the fixed grins of the main stage events. “I don’t think the Conservatives are in a position to win,” said one delegate, self-protectively referring to his party in the third person. “They’re in a position to stay alive.” The other interjected: “If you replace her [leader Kemi Badenoch] now, you’re polling at 10%. I think she should resign in 2028. Be a sacrificial lamb.” The other nodded. “We don’t have many [leadership] choices. A lot of good people have lost their seats …” Even more drastic solutions to the crisis are also being considered. According to a new YouGov poll, almost half the Conservatives’ shrinking membership support a merger with Reform UK – the erasure of the Tories as an independent party after almost 200 or almost 350 years, depending on how you define their hazy origins. British Conservatives can be brutally pragmatic, and the defection of their voters, members and politicians to Reform may soon reach a tipping point. “As long as there’s a rightwing party,” another delegate told me who had been a Tory for decades, “I don’t mind which one it is.” Yet frequently in Manchester the Conservative crisis created not equanimity but feverishness. Each new policy or rhetorical trope seemed more rightwing, and often more authoritarian, than the last. Deporting migrants, deregulating business, disciplining schoolchildren, dumping net zero targets, detaining more minor criminals, dismantling the supposedly liberal judiciary: all the favourite preoccupations of modern rightwing populism and much older, free-market Conservatism were recited like articles of faith. Fringe meetings with hard-right themes were better attended than most events in the main hall, with chairs running out and sweat shining on speakers’ foreheads in fuggy rooms. At one gathering, Chris Philp spoke so fast, almost ranting, about the “scourge of illegal migration”, and how “many of those migrants in hotels commit crimes and work illegally”, that he sounded more like a hotel protester than the shadow home secretary. Elsewhere on the fringe, the Tory peer David Frost had an ominous explanation for why their party is radicalising. “A good chunk of the public is probably to the right of where [Nigel] Farage is.” The shadow justice secretary, Robert Jenrick, told a fringe event: “Public opinion is shifting very fast right now, on a whole range of issues.” In his speech from the main stage, he put it more melodramatically : “The collapse of the old order is in sight. A new one is coming!” Offstage, his replacement of Badenoch as leader was constantly discussed. Yet the argument that more hard-right policies will revive the Tories, under him or anyone else, is undermined by the fact that Reform, and Tommy Robinson, are already catering to that market. Moreover, Badenoch has already moved the Conservatives sharply rightwards without halting their decline. After years of austerity, acute inequality and growing public anger at the privatised utilities, Reform’s promise to address these issues, however partially and cynically, makes their reactionary populism more in tune with the times than the Tory version, which is still stuck in the 1980s, dreaming of a small state and endlessly dynamic businesses. In the more depopulated zones of this year’s conference, there were sometimes as many cardboard cut-outs of Margaret Thatcher as delegates. Badenoch’s speech on Wednesday – her second of the conference, a break with precedent that suggested a desperation to be heard – pledged “a new approach” to Britain’s problems. But it stayed in the traditional Tory comfort zone of promising to liberate individuals and businesses while reining in the state. Even the speech’s supposed big surprise, a vow to abolish stamp duty, had a retro flavour: a tax cut that would most benefit the wealthiest in the old Thatcherite heartlands of southern England. Nothing Badenoch said suggested that she or her party were doing the self-questioning and fresh thinking that their dire position ought to prompt. If you’re not a Conservative, and have suffered from their decades of dominance, it’s tempting simply to relish their difficulties. But the attention-seeking in Manchester this week was just the most extreme and undignified version of a neediness that also afflicts other parties, in an era of tuned-out voters, low election turnouts and political fragmentation. Liberal Democrat leader Ed Davey’s cartoonish stunts and Farage’s hyperbolic press conferences, while seemingly more successful as political theatre, are also pleas to voters to notice their parties. Meanwhile Labour’s conference in Liverpool last week, which tried to use attacks on Reform to make the government’s underlying principles more compelling, has so far generated no improvement in the polls . skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Matters of Opinion Guardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and more Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But a notable absentee will be Kemi Badenoch , as the current Tory leader struggles to stave off the threat of extinction looming over the party Thatcher led to three consecutive election wins. “There is a competition as to who is best to carry forward her legacy,” said the event’s main sponsor, Mohamed Amersi, who has donated £500,000 to the Tories in the past but, like other donors, has been backing Nigel Farage’s party more recently. He said: “There’s no doubt that she would have been sympathetic to much of what Reform are saying, though at the end of the day she was still a reluctant remainer.” Amersi said it would “take time but we will find somebody”, adding there was “not a chance in hell” that Badenoch was the answer to the Tories’ challenges. Badenoch is expected to appear instead at an official party fundraiser dinner in Greenwich. She has likened herself to Thatcher, telling Tories at their annual conference that she too was being written off like Thatcher once was. While Thatcher’s face was a constant presence at this year’s Tory conference, party sources say even many on its rightwing pay lip service to her memory while regarding her small-state philosophy as out of kilter with Britain in 2025. “She is very important though when it comes to mobilising donors,” they added. Many of those donors and those who were close to Thatcher are preferring to go to more private dinners. Among those is Sir Rocco Forte, the Brexit-backing hotelier who helped to fund Johnson’s election win and knew Thatcher. He remains tentatively supportive of Badenoch. He said: “I don’t think there really is a standard bearer for [Thatcher] at the moment in politics. I would say the Conservative party itself now is divided between a big faction which I would not even call Conservative and Kemi Badenoch, who I do still think is a serious believer in what Margaret Thatcher advocated.” Tickets for the sold-out Guildhall event ranged in price from £195 for an individual up to £3,000 for a VIP table. While there will also be Tory grandees such as Michael Howard at the dinner this year, they will be joined by Reform UK figures including its deputy leader, Richard Tice. skip past newsletter promotion Our morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it matters Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Tice said: “She was always about challenging the status quo, with strong conviction, and in a sense that is Nigel’s philosophy. The key thing is that she was a transformational leader of a country that was in trouble then, as it is now.” Events elsewhere include a dinner at the Carlton Club and an 80s-themed disco that Conservatives are holding on Monday at a location described as an ‘‘iconic central London nightclub”. Organisations that have been putting on events include the Centre for Policy Studies (CPS), the thinktank Thatcher co-founded and which provided the intellectual stimulus for her policies. Its director, Robert Colvile, said the Tory conference had probably gone “too far” by displaying her dresses in glass boxes. But he insisted that her political echoes remained powerful, pointing to a CPS event that was packed out by delegates. “If you look at the polls, she is consistently viewed as the most effective leader we have had. Her self-appointed mission was to turn around a Britain that was in decline and we are pretty obviously in that situation again now. Even people like Keir Starmer, while disagreeing with her policy, admit that they admire her for bringing change.”",https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/oct/12/tories-reform-uk-battle-heirs-margaret-thatcher-legacy-100th-birthday,politics,BBC,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8a15d5961b573f74f5ffc8396e485daaa59fd191/921_0_4658_3726/master/4658.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=6c34d340e0be1764e13134c3d5f5bdfc",2025-10-12T14:00:56+00:00,21057734a504112a0daf702bfb112ad9fb6b26f7
d86adcf17b9b,‘Brummies united against racism’: poster campaign takes on the far right,,"W hen Mus unfurled the leaflet lying on her driveway, she was left shocked, angry and upset. “White Britons are already a minority in London … it is clear that if these trends continue white people will become a minority in Britain,” it read. The leaflet, written by a far-right group, was distributed along her street three years ago in Moseley, a leafy suburb of Birmingham . It went on to blame NHS waiting lists, a shortage of social housing and even traffic on “the rising population”. “There we go again, blaming us for everything and causing division,” she thought at the time. But instead of ignoring it, her neighbours came together to figure out a response. “That’s what gave me hope, that people stood together and said ‘not in our names’.” They decided to fight back with their own words by creating a poster with the message: “Brummies united against racism and hate crime”. They were placed in the windows of homes all along the street. “Not long after, a neighbouring street said: ‘Oh, we had those leaflets. Can we have your posters?’” Mus said. Mus was horrified to find far-right propaganda on her doorstep. Photograph: Andrew Fox The campaign continued to grow and last year was endorsed by Birmingham city council. Now it has found renewed salience after a number of alleged hate crimes carried out in the city. Last month a Sikh woman was allegedly raped in a park in Oldbury, in what police are treating as a hate crime. A few weeks later in another park, a 12-year-old boy was allegedly beaten up in what his father described as a racist attack. A man in his 40s was arrested on suspicion of assault. “Operation raise the colours” in which St George’s and union jack flags have been erected across the UK has also caused fear and anxiety. Hope Not Hate and Stand Up to Racism said it had been organised by well-known far-right figures. The Birmingham campaign has been inundated with people who want to show solidarity with people of colour and religious minorities under increasing threat. “People are literally begging us on WhatsApp, can we have a poster?” said Anthony, who lives on the same street as Mus. To meet the demand, a fundraiser has been launched to print out 10,000 posters and distribute them across the city. “Birmingham is a multicultural city and I think it’s important to stand in solidarity with our neighbours, regardless of race, culture or religion,” he said. “Recent events such as flagging and rise of Reform UK are not things I feel comfortable with.” The campaign also hopes to spread beyond the city. According to Mus, activists in Worcester want to mobilise a similar, poster-led initiative. Like Birmingham, the city has recently had a number of racist incidents. Last month, swastikas and the words “no Jew” were painted on garages and on Friday a man and child were sprayed with an unknown substance in an attack described by police as “racially aggravated”. Mus said since the attacks she had avoided visiting parks for fear of being attacked. She is not alone. As a Muslim woman, Raiza* said she felt like a “walking target” in the city. She said her area was full of lamp-posts adorned with the St George’s flag. “I felt quite intimidated by it. I thought, how am I going explain this to my young kids?” One woman felt that Robert Jenrick’s attitude was ‘irresponsible and indicative of someone who doesn’t take part in the day-to-day life of the community he is commenting on’. Photograph: Ian Forsyth/Getty She has also stopped taking her children to the park after the alleged assault on the 12-year-old boy. “You don’t know who’s hostile towards you or who’s completely fine. My kids are fourth-generation British, so we’re pretty established here, but I haven’t felt like this in the past.” She feels that politicians have “done nothing to stop this”, adding “if anything, it’s been encouraged”. Earlier this week, comments by the shadow justice secretary, Robert Jenrick, complaining about visiting an area of Birmingham where he “didn’t see another white face” were revealed by the Guardian. Razia called the comments by Jenrick, who is seen as still harbouring ambitions to become the next leader of the Conservative party, “unhelpful, irresponsible and indicative of someone who doesn’t take part in the day-to-day life of the community that he is commenting on”. She has a poster, but she is hesitant to display it in her window for fear of being marked as a target. “We don’t know if we have any allies where we are living,” she said. “I think it’s important for white people to actually stand up and say, ‘no, I’m not having it’, now more than ever,” said Anthony. “If people want to wave flags and be patriotic, I have no problem with that, but the way that it’s being used now is to stir up resentment. It intimidates people, which I don’t think some seem to understand.” It is hoped that the posters will draw lines in the sand to fend off the far right and show solidarity to those feeling under threat. “People are really behind the idea. It doesn’t take a lot of effort to put up a poster in your window,” he said.",https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/oct/12/brummies-united-against-racism-birmingham-poster-campaign-takes-on-the-far-right,politics,BBC,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e306031449b36a3a35df4c311a007b7c99b75fef/610_0_5581_4463/master/5581.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=475ab66a4bc66673b680059a39913f66",2025-10-12T06:00:44+00:00,cfdabe3a97aae4eb09275a618211c4e3994209b9
2785e1d33eba,Rachel Reeves v the OBR: chancellor aims to loosen the watchdog’s grip,,"For a crew of 50-odd nerds sharing an uninspiring concrete block in Westminster with the Ministry of Justice, the Office for Budget Responsibility has come to wield extraordinary power. It was the OBR projections of Rachel Reeves’s evaporating headroom that left the chancellor scrambling for welfare cuts in March. And it is the watchdog’s rethink about productivity growth that means the chancellor is sure to deliver a second tax-raising budget on 26 November. The Treasury is determined to avoid being dragged around by the OBR in 2026. And so, as she draws up a revenue-raising package, the chancellor is aiming to accumulate more headroom against her fiscal rules, so that every £1bn shift is less make-or-break; and to downgrade the status of the OBR’s spring forecast. Set up during the Tory-Lib Dem coalition, the independent forecaster was meant to prevent politicians from tweaking economic forecasts to suit their own ends. As Labour came to power it embraced the new system, now 15 years old, with Reeves even legislating to prevent future fiscal events taking place without an OBR forecast, as she sought to remind voters of Liz Truss’s catastrophic tenure. Labour saw complying with the the watchdog’s strictures as a crucial signal to investors in government bond markets that the incoming administration had a clear plan for fixing the public finances. Led by the former Treasury and International Monetary Fund (IMF) official Richard Hughes, recently reappointed for a second five-year term, the OBR produces two forecasts a year by law, measuring the chancellor’s tax and spending plans against her fiscal rules . With Reeves’s tricky second budget approaching, it is the OBR’s decision to revisit its long-term assumptions about productivity growth that is causing alarm in No 11. The OBR’s view of this key determinant of economic growth has long looked optimistic relative to the consensus. The resulting reassessment is expected to put forecasts for the public finances in 2030 between £10bn and £30bn adrift of where they appeared to be in March. Reeves and her ministerial colleagues privately grumble that the OBR could and should have reviewed its productivity forecasts earlier. If it had done so while the Conservatives were still in power, Jeremy Hunt’s pre-election cuts to national insurance contributions might have looked unaffordable. Instead, with Labour already struggling in the polls, it will be Reeves who has to explain to the public that the economy is weaker than previously thought – and impose tax increases to make up for the shortfall. Tensions between the OBR and the Treasury have spilled into the open in recent weeks, with Reeves using an interview to call on the forecaster to “score” , that is to say include in its projections, pro-growth government policies. To avoid another spring scramble for savings, Reeves is also considering having the OBR assess her against her rules only once a year. As recommended by the IMF in May , the spring forecast would be indicative rather than binding – perhaps focusing on economic growth rather than the fiscal picture. “The IMF have said that we should move to just one major fiscal event a year, and I agree with their recommendations,” Reeves told Times Radio last week. “To be able to do that, we do need to change the way that the OBR do their forecasting. Two full forecasts a year make it harder to have that one fiscal event.” Hughes has expressed a distinct lack of enthusiasm for that plan, however – telling MPs at a recent Treasury select committee hearing: “The UK has been doing two economic forecasts and fiscal forecasts a year since 1975 … Were we to reduce the number of forecasts to one, that would make us one of the least fiscally transparent countries in Europe and of any major advanced economy.” Adding that his reading of the IMF’s recommendation was that if the government looked set to miss its fiscal rules in the spring it could “let it ride, and make more policy decisions in the autumn”, Hughes insisted: “The government have that option now, and they always had that option.” With Labour losing support in the polls, some of the party’s backbenchers have expressed concern about what they see as the OBR’s malign influence, with Louise Haigh calling it an “unelected institution” that “dictates the limits of government ambition” . Jo Michell, a professor of economics at the University of the West of England, said: “It’s really about how do you stop this silly dance where the government adjusts long-run plans to short-run moves in bond markets. Forecasts are not a bad thing per se, but it’s the tail wagging the dog.” The leftwing thinktank the New Economics Foundation has called for forecasting to be taken back into the Treasury , with an external Office for Fiscal Transparency acting more as a quality check and the chancellor making the final decision. It argues this would be a more democratic framework. James Meadway, a former economic adviser to John McDonnell and host of the podcast Macrodose, argues that it is impossible to drain the politics out of forecasting. “These aren’t neutral facts at all – they’re hotly contested, just like everything else in economics,” he said. He argues for the OBR to act more like the US Congressional Budget Office, which has a wider role in analysing economic policies, including costing opposition plans, for example. However, Jonathan Portes, a former government economist and now professor of economics and public policy at King’s College London, said it was a mistake to lay the blame for the government’s predicament with the OBR. “Are the current rules and the current horizons the right ones? There is no right answer. But the big picture is, that’s not the constraint at the moment – the constraint at the moment is the markets’ view of whether the UK’s position is fiscally sustainable.”",https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/oct/11/rachel-reeves-v-the-obr-chancellor-aims-to-loosen-the-watchdogs-grip,politics,BBC,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ff33dfa476f52d953898428179b241bf0362054f/529_55_2275_1820/master/2275.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=232c0f68c346a12756cbd95133c8637e",2025-10-11T06:00:17+00:00,55faae680a6d8d737b0dd0ee873d6cedc69f8f24
be9e4c47e93e,Will UK taxpayers get their £122m back from PPE Medpro?,,"The five-year unravelling of Britain’s most high-profile Covid contracts scandal involving a baroness, her husband and multimillion-pound government deals accelerated last week with a high court judgment against the company linked to the former Tory peer Michelle Mone . The judge, Mrs Justice Cockerill, ruled that PPE Medpro, owned by Mone’s husband, the Isle of Man-based businessman Doug Barrowman, supplied defective personal protective equipment (PPE) for use in the NHS during the pandemic. Cockerill ordered that PPE Medpro must return the sum of £122m, which the Department of Health and Social Care paid for the order of 25m sterile surgical gowns, under a contract awarded in June 2020 via the VIP lane. The chancellor, Rachel Reeves, hailed the judgment as vindication for the Labour government’s stated determination to recover some of the billions of pounds in public money wasted during the Covid crisis by Boris Johnson’s administration. “We want our money back. We are getting our money back,” Reeves posted on X . “And it will go where it belongs – in our schools, NHS and communities.” The June contract, and another worth £80.85m to supply face masks, also paid for by the DHSC, were granted to PPE Medpro after Mone approached the then Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove in May 2020. Her offer was processed via the “VIP lane”, the system operated by Johnson’s government, giving priority to politically connected people such as Mone, treating them as more credible than experienced PPE suppliers. For years afterwards, Mone and Barrowman through their former lawyers denied involvement in PPE Medpro, until in late 2023 they acknowledged their roles and Mone admitted they had lied . Michelle Mone first approached the the Cabinet Office minister, Michael Gove, in May 2020 with an offer to supply surgical equipment. Composite: Zuma Press Wire/Rex/Shutterstock/Indigo/Getty The gowns were rejected on inspection in September 2020 at the NHS warehousing facilities in Daventry, Northamptonshire, because their labels were invalid, and also signalled that they had not been certified as sterile, a life-protecting requirement. Cockerill ordered that the £122m be repaid by 15 October. Yet in this apparent tale of British justice finally restoring taxpayers’ millions paid out for unsafe medical supplies, there is a looming snag. The judgment is not against Barrowman personally, but his company, which has been left with very little money or assets. In fact, on 30 September, the day before Cockerill delivered her judgment, PPE Medpro Ltd was put into insolvency and administrators appointed. So although the company has until Wednesday to repay the £122m, there appears no realistic possibility that it can. In a series of public statements since the judgment, Mone has accused Reeves of inflammatory language after the chancellor jokingly confirmed that the government had “a vendetta” against the couple, and Barrowman has repeatedly said the judgment was wrong, “a white wash [sic] of the facts”. Neither had given any indication that they intended to fund the repayment of the money, until a new statement on Friday evening when their spokesperson said for the first time that the PPE Medpro “consortium” was prepared to discuss “a possible settlement with the government”. In November 2022, the Guardian revealed that Barrowman had been paid at least £65m from PPE Medpro’s profits, then transferred £29m to a trust set up to benefit Mone and her three adult children. The couple said in a BBC interview in December 2023 that Barrowman’s children were also beneficiaries of the trust. In a statement on 4 October, Barrowman’s spokesperson hit out at PPE Medpro’s supply-chain companies, saying the administrator could bring legal claims against them. It is difficult to see the basis for this, given that PPE Medpro accepted the gowns five years ago and has always argued they complied with the DHSC contract. Barrowman describes PPE Medpro and its supply-chain companies as a consortium. Barrowman’s spokesperson confirmed PPE Medpro’s profits, saying of the £203m from the DHSC, the company paid £137m to the supply-chain companies to source and buy the PPE, which left a profit of £66m for Barrowman’s company. Of that, according to the spokesperson’s figures, PPE Medpro made a £39m profit on the contract for the gowns that were never used. However, although Barrowman made so much from the PPE Medpro deals, and the couple have over the years owned luxury yachts, a private jet and prestige properties in different locations, there is no clear route to the government recovering even a penny after the judgment. The Guardian asked the couple’s spokesperson this week if Barrowman intended to provide the £122m so that PPE Medpro could repay the DHSC. The spokesperson replied: “We are unable to comment on any matters that relate directly to PPE Medpro Ltd. This is not an attempt to avoid your questions. PPE Medpro is now in administration and only the administrators are able to comment on the company. It is vital to make clear, to avoid any misunderstanding, that the court case and subsequent ruling was against PPE Medpro, NOT Mr Barrowman.” The Guardian asked the spokesperson to clarify if that meant Barrowman and Mone did not intend to fund the return of the £122m, or repay any of the money received from PPE Medpro profits. The spokesperson replied: “This is not what my statement said at all, and is a huge leap and incorrect for you to reach this conclusion. Let me be clear: ‘At no stage have we stated that Mr Barrowman has no intention of making any payment to the DHSC. We have been clear that we cannot answer any questions regarding PPE Medpro.’” Michelle Mone and her husband, Doug Barrowman. Photograph: Jeff Moore/PA Media The spokesperson added: “Furthermore, you include Baroness Mone – why? She received no money from the DHSC contract. Her involvement as an introducer was fully disclosed to the DHSC … so to connect her and suggest she must repay money simply because she is married to Mr Barrowman is both unfair and disingenuous and shows that you have a personal/public agenda against her.” In the new statement sent on Friday evening, Barrowman’s spokesperson said: “The consortium partners of PPE Medpro are prepared to enter into a dialogue with the administrators of the company to discuss a possible settlement with the government.” PPE Medpro is now bust – put into administration by Perree Ptc, a private trust company linked to Barrowman registered in the British Virgin Islands tax haven, which had a mortgage-style charge against the company. Barrowman’s spokesperson did not respond to questions about Perree, or the circumstances in which it had put the company into administration. The whole legal basis for limited companies is to protect the people who have put money in from becoming personally liable for all its debts: to give the owners limited liability. If Barrowman, who described himself in the 2023 BBC interview as the ultimate beneficial owner of PPE Medpro, and who received £65m in profits, does not wish to pay the DHSC, the legal routes to enforcing the judgment appear difficult. There are only narrow circumstances in which an administrator or somebody owed money, the government in this case, can get behind a company’s limited liability – “pierce the corporate veil” in legal terminology – and enforce payment from directors or shareholders. “There is no obvious, easy route to recover money from any individuals behind the company in this case,” Simon Walsh, a commercial litigation partner at SA Law , said. “The circumstances for piercing the corporate veil can include where an administrator proves that transactions have been improper, or fraudulent. This may not apply here and investigating it will inevitably be costly, complex and time-consuming. There is a real risk of a pyrrhic victory for the government in this case.” It appears that any process for seeking repayment of the £122m is separate to the long-running investigation by the National Crime Agency into PPE Medpro and whether Mone and Barrowman may have committed criminal offences, including fraud by false representation , in the procurement of the contracts. The couple deny any criminal wrongdoing. The NCA has confirmed that it began its investigation in May 2021, and in April the following year law enforcement officers raided the couple’s mansion on the Isle of Man and their London home, as well as the PPE Medpro offices. In December 2023, Mone and Barrowman agreed to a freezing order of more than £75m worth of assets, including bank accounts, wealth management accounts and shares held in companies owning luxury properties, after an application by the Crown Prosecution Service under the Proceeds of Crime Act. The NCA has not provided any detailed information about the time it is taking or when the CPS might decide whether there will be any criminal charges. PPE Medpro’s barrister, Charles Samek KC, complained during the high court trial that the NCA investigation was “long-running and seemingly never-ending”, and “hanging … like Damocles’ sword” over the company “without ever seemingly being progressed”. In response to questions about how long it was taking, the NCA has said in a statement: “Investigations must pursue all reasonable lines of inquiry. In serious economic crime investigations these lines of inquiry can be incredibly complex. It can take considerable time to ensure that a thorough, independent and objective investigation is conducted.” Illustration: Guardian Design Reeves has insisted the government is determined to recover money lost in failed pandemic spending, pointing to the establishment of the Covid counter-fraud commissioner among other initiatives. In the PPE Medpro case, however, it risks having spent more millions for an expert legal team led by Paul Stanley KC to win a hard-fought £122m judgment it cannot enforce. Government sources have not provided any information about what it might do if the money is not paid on Wednesday. The DHSC has declined to expand on the comments of the health secretary, Wes Streeting, who said on the day of the judgment: “PPE Medpro must now repay the government and the taxpayer £122m. My department will work closely with PPE Medpro Limited’s administrators to recover everything we can.” Daniel Bruce, the chief executive of Transparency International UK, a key member of the UK Anti-Corruption Coalition which was a core participant in the Covid public inquiry into the pandemic contracts debacle, said: “There appear to be very few levers the government has available to recover anything close to the £122m the high court has ordered PPE Medpro to repay. The whole case stands as a further indictment of the ‘VIP lane’ and the flawed, wasteful procurement of PPE during the pandemic.” This saga of the Conservative peer, her businessman husband, Johnson’s Tory government and the multimillion-pound Covid contracts has some way to run yet.

e589c8b84fca,Madagascar’s president says illegal power grab by military is under way,,"Madagascar’s president said an “attempt to seize power illegally and by force” was under way, as an elite military unit that joined protesters on the streets on Saturday announced it was taking over the army. The Capsat unit’s intervention comes after weeks of youth-led protests, which started on 25 September against water and electricity shortages and expanded to calling for the resignation of the president, Andry Rajoelina, an end to corruption and radical overhaul of the political system. Rajoelina said he was “in the country … managing national affairs”, in a statement released on Sunday morning. The newly appointed prime minister, Ruphin Fortunat Zafisambo, had said on state television on Saturday night that the government was “fully ready to listen and engage in dialogue with all factions – youth, unions or the military”. Rajoelina said: “The presidency of the republic wishes to inform the nation and the international community that an attempt to seize power illegally and by force, contrary to the constitution and to democratic principles, is currently under way.” Soldiers from Capsat , which brought Rajoelina to power in a coup in 2009 , said on Sunday morning that they were taking command of the military, according to a videoed statement shared by local news organisations. Later on Sunday, General Demosthene Pikulas, the head of Capsat, was installed as chief of the army staff during a ceremony at the army headquarters attended by armed forces minister Manantsoa Deramasinjaka Rakotoarivelo. “I give him my blessing,” the minister said of Pikulas. Pikulas admitted to journalists after the ceremony that events in Madagascar over the past few days had been “unpredictable”. “So the army has a responsibility to restore calm and peace throughout Madagascar,” he said. When asked if he called for Rajoelina to resign, he refused to “discuss politics within a military facility”. On Saturday, Capsat said it would not fire on protesters and called on the rest of the military to “join forces” in refusing. Late in the afternoon, members of the unit left their base in Soanierana district, in the south of the capital, Antananarivo, driving in armoured vehicles to the symbolic May 13 Square, about 3 miles to the north, accompanied by thousands of cheering protesters. A Capsat general said on Saturday that one of their soldiers had been killed by the gendarmerie, police under the command of the defence ministry, and a journalist had been shot in the buttocks. The UN said at least 22 people were killed at the start of the protests in September, but Rajoelina disputed this last week, saying 12 “looters and vandals” had died. The protests on the Indian Ocean island of around 32 million people were initially coordinated by Gen Z Madagascar , a leaderless group of young people who had been inspired by similar “gen Z” protests in Indonesia and Nepal , where the government was overthrown. Rajoelina fired his government on 29 September in response to the initial demonstrations. However, Gen Z Madagascar rejected this as insufficient, calling for the resignation of the president, as well as the leader of parliament and constitutional court judges, while protesters on the streets continued to shout, “Miala Rajoelina!” (Leave Rajoelina!). Some young activists expressed concern on Saturday about Capsat’s intervention, with one calling the soldiers, and opposition politicians who joined them in May 13 Square, “dangerous”. Madagascar is one of the world’s poorest countries, with a GDP per capita of just $545 last year , according to the World Bank. The precious gem- and vanilla-rich nation was ranked 140 out of 180 countries in Transparency International’s 2024 corruption perceptions index.

9edc815ecc6c,Restitution row: how Nigeria’s new home for the Benin bronzes ended up with clay replicas,,"In a corner of the new Museum of West African Art, visitors can marvel at a sample display of the cultural treasures that adorned the royal palace that once stood in its place: a proud cockerel, a plaque with three mighty warriors, a bust of a king with a glorious beaded collar. The artefacts, collectively known as the Benin bronzes, were looted by British colonial forces who went on to burn down the palace in a punitive expedition in 1897. In the decades that followed they were scattered across collections in Europe and America.

Photograph: Courtesy of University of Aberdeen Their return and public display inside the $25m (£19m) state-of-the-art museum in the city of Benin in Nigeria’s Edo state, co-funded by European governments and western enterprises, was to be the crowning moment of an almost century-long effort to reclaim Africa’s stolen art. Yet when MOWAA opens its doors on 11 November, the only Benin bronzes on display will be clay replicas – a far cry from the “most comprehensive display [of Benin bronzes] in the world” touted by authorities when plans for the museum to become their home were announced in 2020. About 150 original bronzes have been returned to Nigeria over the last five years, some on the initiative of private collections and some as acts of state by Germany and the Netherlands. For now, none are on public display. If the looting of the original bronzes took place in the context of what has been called the “scramble for Africa”, as European nations raced to claim overseas territories in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, restitution has in part resembled a scramble in reverse. Western actors tried to outbid each other to atone for their past, before authorities in Nigeria had settled old rivalries about what restitution precisely entailed.

Photograph: NurPhoto SRL/Alamy “In the west, there was a race about who was going to be the first institution to restitute,” said MOWAA’s director and chair Phillip Ihenacho, without naming individual museums or governments. “And there was not enough of a focus on to whom they would be restituted to. “I think that there was a well-intentioned effort that was focused very much around being seen to be a pioneer in this area. But a lot of people in the west failed to understand the complexities within those countries.” Nigerian demands for the Benin bronzes’ return, first voiced in the 1930s, were widely shunned by western governments and institutions until 2007, when a consortium of European museums and Nigerian officials formed the Benin Dialogue group. On the Nigerian side, the group included not just representatives of the federal Nigerian government, but also of Edo state, where the kingdom of Benin was once located, and of Ewuare II, the descendant of the royal family that once owned the bronzes, known as the Oba of Benin. Which of these three parties were entitled to the bronzes upon their return has historically been a bone of contention. The Oba has argued that since they were looted from the palace, they should be returned to the descendants and not to Edo state. European participants in the discussions were of the impression that the conflict on the Nigerian side had been settled. Race to return In November 2019, the group invited Ghanaian-British architect David Adjaye to come up with plans for a new museum where the returned treasures could be stored and put on public display. Still, to the frustration of officials in Nigeria and activists in Europe, there were no concrete announcements on physical returns. The spring of 2021 was to provide a sudden step-change. In a March interview with the German newspaper Süddeutsche Zeitung, the director of Berlin’s newly opened Humboldt Forum let slip that the museum was considering leaving symbolic empty spaces where it had intended to display Benin bronzes from its collection, with the originals returning to Nigeria. The comment surprised German government officials, who were in west Africa to discuss repatriations with their Nigerian counterparts, and set high expectations among the public and other organisations. A flurry of activity followed: days later, Aberdeen University in Scotland announced it would also return a pillaged bronze. Then similar declarations were made by the Horniman museum in London, Cambridge University, New York’s Met and the Rhode Island School of Design’s art museum. Museum officials suggest the pace of these developments was also fanned by the Nigerian cultural heritage agency, whose representatives were jetting around the world to strike return deals. In December 2022, a German state delegation travelled to Nigeria with 21 bronzes packaged in crates in the belly of the government plane, an initiative pushed for by the then foreign minister Annalena Baerbock, of the German Green party, who was eager to make her mark a year into office. “It could and should have been a lot less hectic,” said one official directly involved in preparing the trip.

It was a grand, pathos-filled moment but underneath the surface, tensions that the Europeans believed had been laid to rest were bubbling up again. Present at the ceremony were ministers of the federal Nigerian government and representatives of Edo state, but not the Oba.

Media outlets loyal to the palace accused Obaseki of having set up MOWAA in order to hijack the restitution process, calling for its occupancy licence to be revoked . Godwin Obaseki. Photograph: DPA Picture Alliance/Alamy The tussle over the bronzes was ended in an abrupt fashion on 23 March 2023, when Nigeria’s federal government announced in an official gazette that the Oba of Benin was the stolen treasures’ rightful owner and custodian, and that they must be stored within his residence in Benin City unless the royal family decided otherwise. The move caused howls of outrage among those in Europe who had been sceptical of the restitution in the first place. Centre-right German daily Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung called it “a fiasco”, suggesting that the bronzes would be locked away in the Oba’s private residence with no access for the public. This is unlikely to be the case: a former cultural centre adjacent to the Oba’s residence is rumoured to be earmarked as a designated future museum. “The new name will be Benin Royal museum and this is where they plan to store the bronzes,” said Benin-born Mercy Imiegha, director of Lagos-based Nomadic Art Gallery. At any rate, inter-Nigerian disputes should not deflect from the urgent need for the bronzes’ return, say restitution advocates. “The Benin bronzes in German museums would never have found their way to Europe if British forces hadn’t invaded the Benin Kingdom and sacked the royal palace,” said Barbara Plankensteiner, director of Hamburg’s Museum am Rothenbaum and co-spokesperson of the Benin Dialogue group. “We are looking at the largest theft of a royal treasure in history. There was a moral imperative for them to be returned to Africa with no strings attached.” Benin bronzes at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York. Photograph: Art2010/Alamy Andreas Goergen, a former secretary general of the German Federal Ministry for Culture and the Media, said: “Dealing with the art objects of traditional rulers is difficult for any republic. Germany took 100 years to reach an agreement with the Hohenzollerns [the German imperial dynasty that was overthrown at the end of the first world war]. Nigeria took four to reach an agreement with the Oba of Benin. So, no reason to be snooty.” “The Europeans can’t tell us what we should or shouldn’t do with the objects of our heritage,” said Toyin Akinosho, co-founder of the nonprofit Committee for Relevant Art, which organises the Lagos Book and Arts festival. “Can’t we hold conversations here too about programming of new culture spaces?” MOWAA, meanwhile, has had to readjust. Originally supposed to be called the Edo Museum of West African Art, it decided to remove the name of the state to emphasise its impartiality. The Museum of West African Art. Photograph: Museum of West African Art (MOWAA) “We had hoped that we would be able to provide support to the restitution effort by demonstrating that we have institutions in West Africa that have what the west would regard as world-class display and storage facilities,” said Ihenacho. “But we never were set up to be the exclusive Benin bronzes museum.” One space will host an exhibition about the archaeological dig carried out on the MOWAA site with £3m in support from London’s British Museum, which still holds the largest single collection of looted Benin bronzes in the world. A selection of about 100 artefacts will hint at the story of the kingdom of Benin and its dissolution. “Some of them may well be made of bronze,” said Ihenacho. “But there will be nothing that was involved in the restitution process.”",https://www.theguardian.com/news/ng-interactive/2025/oct/12/restitution-row-how-nigerias-new-home-for-the-benin-bronzes-ended-up-with-clay-replicas,World,BBC,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/56783b4860feb61d9f83fc083031338246e9d58a/455_0_4561_3648/master/4561.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=04455f635e51cc58bf66385f4f349e35",2025-10-12T05:00:44+00:00,f85579a5d52887324ba6765d022e608bb424ce8a
72b17fd3ab1a,Cameroon’s 92-year-old president set for another term as country goes to polls,,"Cameroon goes to the polls on Sunday for a presidential election with Paul Biya, already the world’s oldest head of state at the age of 92, the favourite to win an eighth term in power in the central African country. A fractured opposition of 11 candidates is standing against Biya, who, despite his advanced age and declining health, has dismissed calls for him to retire. “Our candidate is in great shape ... and he is capable of continuing what he has started,” Grégoire Owona, the labour minister and the ruling party’s secretary general, told French radio RFI in late September. Many of the 7.8 million Cameroonians eligible to vote can remember no leader other than Biya, who has held on to the presidency with an iron fist since 1982. The vote is taking place against the backdrop of political stagnation, a cost of living crisis and social unrest. Opposition parties have accused the electoral commission, Elections Cameroon, of being subservient to the ruling party, and the most credible opposition candidate, Maurice Kamto, has had his candidacy barred by the courts. Other candidates include former ministers Issa Tchiroma Bakary, who recently defected from the presidential camp and has gathered several thousand people at meetings around the country, and Bello Bouba Maigari, who was Biya’s first prime minister in 1982. Observers say their individual campaigns lacked the cohesion necessary to mount a significant challenge to Biya’s long-standing rule. Cameroon faces significant socioeconomic challenges; a third of the population lives on less than $2 (£1.50) a day, youth unemployment is rampant, and many young people have expressed disillusionment with the electoral process, citing a lack of economic opportunities and political representation.

Photograph: Zohra Bensemra/Reuters Voter turnout has declined dramatically over the years, exacerbated by ongoing conflicts with jihadists in the Far North region and anglophone separatists in the west. The latter crisis, which began in 2017, has led to thousands of deaths in the country’s two English-speaking regions and forcibly displaced over 700,000 people. Kah Wallah, the leader of the Cameroon People’s party and founder of the Stand Up For Cameroon movement, said the anglophone crisis is one of the reasons why the movement has not supported elections since 2018. “We still believe it is unconscionable for the Biya regime to go to elections without ensuring the security of citizens in #NOSO,” she said, referring to a common abbreviation for Cameroon’s anglophone North-West and South-West regions. The government has been criticised for its heavy handed response, which has left many in the anglophone regions feeling marginalised and open to boycotting the vote. Biya, who is rarely seen in public, held his first and only campaign rally on Tuesday. Addressing a crowd of supporters at a stadium in the Far North town of Maroua, he promised to step up security in the region, curb youth unemployment, and improve road infrastructure and social amenities if reelected. “I am well aware of the problems that concern you, I know the unfulfilled expectations that make you doubt the future,” Biya said in his speech. “Based on my own experience, I can assure you that these problems are not insurmountable.” This year’s election cycle has featured striking appeals for him to step aside. First came the Catholic archbishop Samuel Kleda, who went on French radio last Christmas to say it was “not realistic” for Biya to keep doing the job. Then came the defections of Tchiroma and Maigari, both of whom openly challenged Biya’s fitness to lead. Finally, the president’s daughter Brenda Biya, 27, said on TikTok last month that her father “has made too many people suffer” and urged Cameroonians not to vote for him. She later recanted, but the post continues to circulate widely among Biya’s detractors. Theophile, an artist in the economic capital, Douala, called the vote a “scam”. The 24-year-old had hoped to vote for Kamto, who came second to Biya in the 2018 election. “As long as the system remains in place, there is nothing that can be done. There has to be a change,” he said.

42d7d08832c3,Madagascar’s prime minister calls for calm after elite soldiers join protests against president,,"Madagascar’s prime minister called for calm after an elite group of soldiers joined thousands of protesters against the country’s president on the streets of the capital on Saturday afternoon. Protesters marched alongside soldiers from the Capsat unit, who drove armoured vehicles, some waving Madagascar flags, from their base in Soanierana in the south of Antananarivo. A Capsat leader, Lylison René de Rolland, then addressed the cheering crowds in front of the city hall in 13 May Square, which protesters had previously been prevented from reaching. Capsat soldiers brought the current president, Andry Rajoelina, to power in a coup in 2009 . Speaking on state television on Saturday night, the prime minister, Ruphin Fortunat Zafisambo, said the government was “fully ready to listen and engage in dialogue with all factions – youth, unions or the military”. Rajoelina appointed Zafisambo and a new defence and security minister after dissolving the previous government last week in response to the protests. The soldiers’ intervention ratcheted up pressure on Rajoelina, who demonstrators have been demanding stand down. The youth-led protests broke out on 25 September, initially over water and electricity cuts. However, they quickly widened into calls for a complete overhaul of the political system, with the gen Z protesters not placated by Rajoelina firing his government last week. Earlier in the day, police fired stun grenades and teargas to try to disperse the protesters. The recently appointed minister of the armed forces also called on troops to “remain calm”, at a press conference on Saturday. “We call on our brothers who disagree with us to prioritise dialogue,” minister general Deramasinjaka Manantsoa Rakotoarivelo said. “The Malagasy army remains a mediator and constitutes the nation’s last line of defence.” However, a Capsat leader accompanied by a large group of soldiers called on other military units to “refuse orders to shoot your friends”, in a video that was posted on social media before they left their barracks. “Let us join forces, military, gendarmes and police, and refuse to be paid to shoot our friends, our brothers and our sisters,” he said, also calling on soldiers at the airport to “prevent all aircraft from taking off”. “Close the gates and await our instructions,” he said. “Do not obey orders from your superiors. Point your weapons at those who order you to fire on your comrades-in-arms, because they will not take care of our families if we die.” Nothing has been posted on the president’s social media accounts since Friday evening, when he was pictured meeting the heads of 10 of the country’s universities to discuss improving students’ lives. An activist who attended Saturday’s demonstrations said she was concerned about the involvement of Capsat, due to their role in the 2009 coup that brought Rajoelina to power. She also criticised politicians who made brief addresses to the crowds in front of the city hall as “opportunists”. “That’s why I’m not rejoicing at all, because all of those people gravitating around this ‘event’ are all dangerous,” said the activist, who didn’t want to be named for fear for her safety. A member of Gen Z Madagascar, a leaderless group of young people that has helped to coordinate the protests, also expressed doubts about what would happen next. “We are very happy, but a lot is happening [and] we don’t want another corrupted person to take the power here, so we will do everything to have the right to choose who to put up there,” he said.

85a5de3d976d,"Militia strikes kill at least 60 in Sudan displacement camp, says El Fasher group",,"Militia drone and artillery strikes have killed at least 60 people at a displacement shelter in the besieged city of El Fasher in western Sudan , a local activist group has said. The resistance committee for El Fasher said the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) paramilitary group hit the Dar al-Arqam displacement centre, which is in the grounds of a university. Bodies remained trapped in the rubble, the committee said in a statement, describing it as a “massacre” and calling on the international community to intervene. It said in a later statement that the shelter had been hit twice by drones and eight times by artillery shells on Friday and Saturday. Map showing drone strikes in Sudan “Children, women and the elderly were killed in cold blood, and many were completely burned,” said the committee, which is part of a group of activists who coordinate aid and document abuses in the conflict. “The situation has gone beyond disaster and genocide inside the city, and the world remains silent.” A separate medical group, called the Sudan Doctors’ Network, gave a figure of 53 people killed in the strikes, including 14 children and 15 women. The RSF has been fighting the Sudanese Armed Forces in a civil war since April 2023. Its militants have put El Fasher under siege for more than 500 days and families there are starving. El Fasher – home to 400,000 people – is the last state capital in the region of Darfur that has not been taken by the RSF. It has become a strategic front in the war as the paramilitaries attempt to consolidate control in the west. The UN has described the Sudan war as one of the worst humanitarian crises of the 21st century. More than 150,000 people have been killed and more than 14 million displaced. Nearly 25 million people have been forced into acute hunger. Countrywide fighting, fuelled by international powers , has raged in the absence of an effective global effort to end the bloodshed. On Friday, the UN high commissioner for human rights, Volker Türk, said he was “appalled by the RSF’s endless and wanton disregard for civilian life” in El Fasher. He said: “Despite repeated calls, including my own, for specific care to be taken to protect civilians, they continue instead to kill, injure and displace civilians, and to attack civilian objects, including [internally displaced people’s] shelters, hospitals and mosques, with total disregard for international law. This must end.” Sudan’s current conflict erupted in 2023, but is part of decades of violence. On Monday, the international criminal court took its first action against a suspect of crimes in Darfur when it convicted a leader of a militia for atrocities committed there more than 20 years ago. Ali Muhammad Ali Abd-al-Rahman, also known by the nom de guerre Ali Kushayb, was accused of being a leader of the Janjaweed militia, a group from which the RSF developed. The former Sudanese president Omar al-Bashir is also wanted by the ICC on genocide charges. Türk said the RSF, and all parties to the conflict, should “draw lessons from this week’s conviction of Ali Kushayb”.

290c18e54795,"In Venezuela’s ‘darkest hours’, will peace prize boost opposition or backfire?",,"I n March 2019 as a nationwide blackout plunged Venezuela into darkness, hundreds of citizens huddled on a basketball court in the city of Maracaibo to hear their leader promise to guide them out of the gloom. “We are, quite literally, living through our darkest hour. But these are also the brightest of times,” María Corina Machado told supporters as they used mobile phones to illuminate the night. Six and a half years later, on Friday Machado used almost identical words to celebrate winning the Nobel peace prize for her “extraordinary” – yet incomplete – struggle against Venezuela’s “brutal, authoritarian state” under the president, Nicolás Maduro. “We are … living the darkest hours. But at the same time there is enormous hope,” Machado declared after hearing the news, before vowing: “Venezuela will be free.” For all Machado’s relentless optimism, one question lingered after Friday’s surprise announcement in Oslo: this time, was she right? Would receiving the prestigious prize advance Machado’s tenacious campaign to unseat Maduro, or could it backfire and lead to greater repression from the autocrat’s feared security forces? International supporters voiced confidence that political change was coming for a country that has slipped into authoritarianism and economic malfunction since Maduro succeeded Hugo Chávez in 2013, with about 8 million citizens fleeing abroad. “The thirst for democracy always prevails,” wrote the European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen. Carlos Lizarralde, the author of a book about Venezuela’s collapse, said the prize would boost Machado by “cementing her position in the eyes of the international community … as the one credible opposition leader” in the South American country. “A Nobel laureate, in many ways, is the secular equivalent of a living saint. This perfectly complements her quasi-religious public image,” Lizarralde said of Machado, a devout Catholic who before going into hiding after last year’s rigged presidential election attended rallies clutching a rosary and wearing crosses around her neck. Others are more sceptical. David Smilde, a Tulane University Venezuela expert, said the prize would “definitely draw more international attention to the Venezuelan conflict and perhaps [create] more resolve” to end it. “But judging by past Nobel winners, it will not be fundamental,” Smilde added, noting how the 1994 prize shared by Yasser Arafat, Shimon Peres and Yitzhak Rabin did not fundamentally reconfigure the interests and forces involved in the Middle East conflict. Ronald Krebs, a political scientist who has studied the impact of Nobel peace prizes awarded in the hope of promoting political change in authoritarian countries, said his research showed they rarely succeeded. Krebs cited Liu Xiaobo , the Chinese poet and activist who received the prize in 2010 while in prison – a decision Beijing called an “anti-China farce” . Liu died seven years later, still in custody and with his homeland having become an even more repressive one-party state under its Communist party leader, Xi Jinping. In 2003, the Iranian activist Shirin Ebadi was honoured for her struggle for democracy and human rights . Krebs said becoming a laureate “insulated” Ebadi from persecution since Tehran feared jailing such a high-profile figure. “But it did absolutely nothing for those who were not similarly protected … if anything they were further repressed because of the Nobel peace prize,” he said. Krebs said peace prizes could inspire human rights defenders “to come forward with greater vigour”. “[But] at the same time it gives the repressive regime even more incentive to repress those who would seek to effect change. [So] it creates a really problematic and worrisome dynamic that … ultimately works to the detriment of those who are advocating for domestic political change … The road to hell is paved with good intentions.” Allies hope Machado’s prize will “bulletproof” her against regime reprisals. But Krebs said it was “extraordinarily doubtful” it would produce democratic change. Andrés Izarra, a former minister for Maduro’s mentor Chávez, was also doubtful, although he said Venezuela’s authoritarian president was facing the greatest challenge of his 12-year reign. Internationally isolated after being accused of stealing last year’s election from Machado’s ally Edmundo González, Maduro is also facing an unprecedented US pressure campaign that many suspect is aimed at forcing regime change. Since August, Donald Trump has ordered a major naval buildup off Venezuela’s Caribbean coast, with a series of deadly strikes on alleged Venezuelan drug smuggling boats. “There’s never been a clearer chance of displacing [Maduro] from power than now,” Izarra said. But the ex-minister dismissed the idea that Trump’s pressure campaign would “break” Maduro’s regime by sparking a military revolt. Izarra also doubted Trump would invade. “What you have in the Caribbean is a regime change operation … but it’s a performative one,” he said, designed to coerce Maduro into making concessions during secret talks Izarra believes are happening between US and Venezuelan officials. “This is all going to resolve itself at the negotiating table,” Izarra predicted. Maduro and his allies were “never going to surrender power voluntarily” but equally Trump would never alienate his anti-intervention Maga movement by putting boots on the ground. “They don’t want forever wars. They don’t want Vietnam. They don’t want Iraq,” Izarra said. Perhaps the only certainty is that Machado, a famously stubborn Margaret Thatcher-admiring conservative known as Venezuela’s “Iron Lady”, is unlikely to turn. “She’s a true fighter,” said Lizarralde, predicting Machado would battle on. “In her mind, this is an epic struggle between good and evil … and she [is convinced she] represents good.”",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/oct/12/venezuela-maria-corina-machado-nobel-peace-prize-boost-or-backfire,World,BBC,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dd04450904add5b134acf7ae76edf5d9f170e437/688_0_6880_5504/master/6880.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=9b739948ca45f0e9285606022bd3c670",2025-10-12T15:26:28+00:00,6d0df3710d1a9bd3c51ec0f7b189760165d08791
833045b71802,Venezuelan politician María Corina Machado wins Nobel peace prize,,"The Venezuelan opposition politician María Corina Machado has won the Nobel peace prize for her dogged struggle to rescue the South American country from its fate as “a brutal, authoritarian state”. Machado, 58, a conservative often described as Venezuela’s Iron Lady, has spent the last year living in hiding after her political movement was widely believed to have beaten the country’s president, Nicolás Maduro , in the July 2024 presidential election. Maduro refused to accept he had lost to Machado’s ally, the former diplomat Edmundo González, and launched a ferocious political crackdown that forced González into exile and Machado to go underground. In one of her last public appearances in Caracas, Machado said she was convinced Maduro’s days in power were numbered after his apparently stinging defeat. “I would say his departure is irreversible,” she told the Guardian . More than a year later Maduro remains in power and, crucially, has retained the support of Venezuela’s military and key international backers such as China and Russia. Donald Trump has ordered a major naval buildup off Venezuela’s Caribbean coast in recent weeks, which some suspect could be a prelude to some kind of regime change operation. Who is María Corina Machado,'Venezuela’s Iron Lady' and new Nobel peace prize winner? – video Machado reacted to her Nobel prize in a video that González posted on social media in which the pair celebrate the news. “I can’t believe it! My God!” an incredulous Machado tells her ally. “It’s fucking incredible!” replies González. The Norwegian Nobel Institute shared a video of the moment its director, Kristian Berg Harpviken, woke up Machado with the news. “Oh my God!” she said. “I have no words … But I hope you understand that … I am just one person, I certainly don’t deserve this.” “It caught her totally by surprise,” said Pedro Mario Burelli, an opposition politician and friend of more than four decades. “She’s very moved. She’s very concerned about what impact this has on the last phase of the struggle. She’s tearful,” he added, shortly after speaking to Machado on Friday morning. Writing on X, Machado dedicated the prize to “the suffering people of Venezuela and to President Trump for his decisive support of our cause!” She said the prize was “an impetus to conclude our task: to conquer freedom”. “We are on the threshold of victory and today more than ever we count on President Trump, the people of the United States, the peoples of Latin America, and the democratic nations of the world as our main allies to achieve freedom and democracy.” Machado in Caracas during the 2024 election campaign. Photograph: Alexandre Meneghini/Reuters The Nobel committee celebrated Machado’s long struggle for democracy in a statement that called her “one of the most extraordinary examples of civilian courage in Latin America in recent times”. It also paid tribute to the Venezuelan opposition’s “innovative and brave, peaceful and democratic” push for change during last year’s election, when hundreds of thousands of volunteers mobilised to observe the election and collect detailed tallies showing that González had won. “But the regime refused to accept the election result, and clung to power,” the committee said, painting a dire picture of life in Venezuela, which has gradually sunk into dictatorship since Maduro was democratically elected in 2013 after the death of his mentor, Hugo Chávez. “Venezuela has evolved from a relatively democratic and prosperous country to a brutal, authoritarian state that is now suffering a humanitarian and economic crisis,” the committee said. “Most Venezuelans live in deep poverty, even as the few at the top enrich themselves. The violent machinery of the state is directed against the country’s own citizens. Nearly 8 million people have left the country. The opposition has been systematically suppressed by means of election rigging, legal prosecution and imprisonment.” Machado, whom many Venezuelans know simply as MCM or María Corina, has been involved in politics for more than two decades and was a member of Venezuela’s national assembly from 2011 to 2014. She famously clashed with Chávez over Venezuela’s economic tribulations in 2012, earning the rebuke: “Eagles don’t hunt flies.” But it was in touring the economically devastated country by car and motorbike in the lead-up to the 2024 election that she cemented her reputation as Chavismo’s most effective and influential adversary. Her rallies drew huge, ecstatic crowds, with many supporters declaring an almost religious devotion to the charismatic Catholic politician, who promised to reunite millions of Venezuelan families separated by the mass migration triggered by Venezuela’s economic meltdown under Maduro. “She connected with people on the one issue that matters to people – which is family,” said Burelli, noting how Machado’s relatives had also been forced to flee abroad. “Everybody understands that she is in the same boat.” Machado addressing supporters at a protest in January. Photograph: Leonardo Fernández Viloria/Reuters Machado had originally hoped to run for president, but Venezuela’s pro-regime supreme court banned her from doing so, leaving González, a little-known former ambassador, to fill her shoes. “She will go down in history as the great opposition leader of our times … whether she makes it to the presidency or not,” said Carlos Lizarralde, the author of Venezuela’s Collapse: The Long Story of How Things Fell Apart​. The committee commended Machado as a “brave and committed champion of peace” who had kept “the flame of democracy burning during a growing darkness”. It also celebrated her as “a key, unifying figure in a political opposition that was once deeply divided”. For all her popular support, however, Machado is not universally liked. Some Venezuelans distrust her as a result of thinly veiled calls for a foreign military intervention to unseat Maduro in the past. She argued in 2019 that only a “a real, credible severe and imminent threat” of the use of international force would convince Maduro to leave power. David Smilde, a Tulane University Venezuela specialist, said: “María Corina Machado has shown incredible courage in fighting for democracy. In 2023-24 she heroically mobilised the Venezuelan population for presidential elections. However, much of her fight before then and since then has been through non-democratic means, seeking to generate international military intervention.” Others are suspicious of her ties to radical rightwing politicians such as Trump and Brazil’s former president Jair Bolsonaro, and her support for Trump’s widely discredited claim that a Venezuelan gang, the Tren de Aragua – has launched an “invasion” of the US. Trump and top officials such as Stephen Miller have used that spurious claim as justification for its campaign against Venezuelan migrants – scores of whom were deported to a high-security prison in authoritarian El Salvador – and for strikes on alleged “narco-boats” in the Caribbean that have killed at least 21 people. Maduro and his allies mockingly refer to Machado as “La Sayona” [“the sackcloth woman”] – the name of a hideous female ghost from Venezuelan folklore who roams the country taking violent revenge on unfaithful husbands. Christopher Sabatini, a senior research fellow on Latin America at Chatham House, said Maduro would be furious at the Nobel committee’s decision. “The question is, what now? Will it prompt public demonstrations in favour of María Corina Machado that [heap] some sort of public pressure on the government? Perhaps,” he said. “I think they would be hard-pressed to crack down with the international community [watching], but they did it in July 2024.” Burelli said he believed the award would shield his friend from possible arrest or persecution as she continued her fight for change. “This now truly protects her,” he said, arguing that the cost of targeting her would be “unbearable” for Maduro’s regime. “Now, I think she is bulletproof.”",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/oct/10/venezuelan-politician-maria-corina-machado-wins-nobel-peace-prize,World,BBC,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ba7f9656b4f477fad57a303c1cee53441417724e/312_0_3333_2667/master/3333.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=9270d4ec008427555972f81507219f9b",2025-10-10T14:59:33+00:00,dc7301c4a4e44c54b4fa8e9d0733e5e10d8fcbed

Boluarte refused to appear before Congress on Friday for an overnight hearing after a majority of lawmakers, including some once loyal to her, voted to initiate impeachment proceedings. They summoned Boluarte to appear before Congress at 11.30pm, but she skipped the proceedings that ended with 118 lawmakers voting for her impeachment. “The president’s impeachment has been approved,” announced the Congress leader, José Jerí, who took over the South American country’s presidency until April 2026 when elections are due to be held. José Jerí is sworn in as Peru’s interim president. Photograph: Angela Ponce/Reuters “Today, I humbly assume the presidency of the republic ... in order to install and lead a transitional government,” Jerí told parliament after being sworn in. Protests have marked Boluarte’s presidency, along with various scandals , investigations and a rise in gang violence. She had already faced down several attempts to remove her from office. The latest effort cited her “permanent moral incapacity” to carry out her duties since assuming office in December 2022. Peru has had six presidents in about nine years. Boluarte, who took office after her predecessor, Pedro Castillo, was impeached over a crackdown on protests that killed at least 50 people, had seen her approval rating plummet.

b79fbd8e51af,President Petro accuses US of killing Colombians in attacks on ‘narco-boats’,,"Colombia’s president has drawn Washington’s ire after accusing the US of killing Colombian citizens during a recent boat strike in the Caribbean Sea. “A new theatre of war has opened up: the Caribbean,” Gustavo Petro wrote on his official X account on Wednesday night. The US has launched at least four deadly aerial attacks on alleged drug trafficking boats crossing the waterway since early September, when 11 people were killed in the first strike. The South American country’s leftwing leader claimed there were “indications” that the most recently destroyed boat was Colombian “and had Colombians onboard”. “I hope their families come forwards to report this,” added Petro, a fierce critic of Donald Trump, without offering further details or evidence. Since the US began its strikes in the Caribbean at least 21 people have reportedly lost their lives. On Friday, the US defense secretary, Pete Hegseth, said four “narco-terrorists” were killed in international waters “just off the coast of Venezuela” as they transported “substantial amounts of [US-bound] narcotics”. However, the names of those killed on the supposed “narco-boats” have not been released and Trump officials have failed to provide any proof that the victims were involved in smuggling drugs to the US. The White House pushed back against Petro’s claims, demanding he publicly retract “his baseless and reprehensible statement” about the boat attack. But two US officials, who were not authorised to discuss the matter publicly, told the New York Times that Colombians were on at least one of the boats recently destroyed by the US. Petro urged the White House to release the names of those killed by US strikes “so I can see if my information is unfounded”. Washington claims its strikes – which are part of a major military buildup in the Caribbean Sea – are part of a large-scale crackdown on Venezuelan narco groups it accuses of flooding the US with cocaine. However, the decision to deploy warships and thousands of marines off Venezuela’s Caribbean coast has left many observers many wondering if the operation is actually a pretext to depose Venezuela’s authoritarian president, Nicolás Maduro. “The deployment is vastly disproportionate to any real counter-narcotics mission. So this really looks, walks and talks like a regime change preparation,” Juan González, the White House’s former top Latin America official, told CNN this week. González, who served under Joe Biden, said that by some estimates “roughly 10% of naval assets” had been sent to the region. On Wednesday, Maduro, who Trump failed to topple during his first term, warned that his troops were preparing for a possible attempt at regime change. “If the gringos attack, we will respond.” Venezuela’s defense minister, Vladimir Padrino López, said he was braced for a variety of scenarios including drone attacks, an air campaign or acts of sabotage or targeted assassinations carried out by US special forces. Writing on Wednesday, Petro claimed “the war” playing out in the Caribbean Sea was not about drug smuggling but oil, a commodity of which Venezuela boasts the world’s largest reserves. “The world must stop this,” Petro added. “This aggression is aimed at the whole of Latin America and the Caribbean.” On Thursday, Grenada’s ministry of foreign affairs confirmed it ha​d received a request from the US for the “temporary installation of radar equipment and associated technical personnel”. The confirmation followed days of speculation by local media that the US was going to ask the country to host military assets to help with their operations in the southern Caribbean. While some Caribbean nations, such as Trinidad and Tobago, have welcomed the US’s military presence in the region, others have described it as a threat to peace and security. The Venezuela-backed Bolivarian Alliance for the Peoples of Our America trade bloc, of which Grenada is a member, had condemned the US deployment of warships as a “flagrant violation” of international law. In its statement, Grenada said it was carefully reviewing the request and would only make a decision after “technical and legal assessments”.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/oct/09/gustavo-petro-colombia-boats-us-military,World,BBC,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/488b1068a4859286fa00a06f1f29b1bee22011c1/0_0_1500_1200/master/1500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=96fffc94179e9c3ff73d6148fa134c97",2025-10-09T21:28:51+00:00,78c1c31d0171763b3ed4ea6ffbdbba298a7012e8
d3e751bd2764,Cristina Fernández de Kirchner: Argentinian court sentences man to 10 years for attempted assassination,,"A court in Argentina has sentenced a man to 10 years in prison after finding him guilty of attempting to kill former president Cristina Fernández de Kirchner . The court in Buenos Aires also sentenced the man’s accomplice to eight years in prison, capping a dramatic case that has captivated the country since 2022, when the main defendant, Fernando Sabag Montiel, squeezed through a crowd outside the ex-president’s home, thrust a loaded gun at her face and pulled the trigger. The gun did not go off. Fernández de Kirchner, Argentina’s vice-president at the time, was unharmed. The botched assassination attempt provoked street protests from Fernández de Kirchner’s diehard supporters as well as scepticism and conspiracy theories from her fervent critics. Man points gun at Argentinian vice-president Cristina Fernández de Kirchner – video Among Latin America’s best-known politicians with three decades at the forefront of Argentinian politics and two terms as president from 2007 to 2015, Fernández de Kirchner is a deeply polarising figure whose brand of leftwing populism brought Argentina infamy for its runaway inflation and enormous fiscal deficits. Convicted of corruption for allegedly steering public roadworks contracts to a friend’s company, Fernández de Kirchner, 72, was sentenced earlier this year to six years in prison. Citing her age and safety fears since the 2022 attack, a court allowed her to serve her time under house arrest in Buenos Aires. While banned from running for public office, she remains outspoken against Argentina’s libertarian president, Javier Milei. From her apartment, she still posts diatribes on social media, waves at supporters gathered below her balcony and receives high-profile visitors, such as the Brazilian president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, who visited her in July . Fernández de Kirchner has long rejected the corruption charges as politically motivated. Fernando Sabag Montiel confessed to the crime in court, describing his assassination attempt as a means to exact justice for Fernández de Kirchner’s alleged corruption. Photograph: Luis Robayo/AFP/Getty Images In the trial that concluded Wednesday, prosecutors aimed to prove that Sabag Montiel, an Argentinian citizen born in Brazil, and his then girlfriend, Brenda Uliarte, planned the assassination attempt in advance. The prosecution produced WhatsApp chats about the firearm and evidence that the former couple visited Fernández de Kirchner’s house before the attack to observe her routines and security. At the time of the shooting, Fernández de Kirchner was standing trial for corruption and crowds rallied regularly outside her home in solidarity. The former president’s supporters managed to catch Sabag Montiel as he tried to flee the scene after firing the defective gun.

8de7c3bd4b88,China warns US of retaliation over Trump’s 100% tariffs threat,,"Beijing has told the US it will retaliate if Donald Trump fails to back down on his threat to impose 100% tariffs on Chinese imports as investors brace for another bout of trade war turmoil. China’s commerce ministry blamed Washington for raising trade tensions between the two countries after Trump announced on Friday that he would impose the additional tariffs on China’s exports to the US , along with new controls on critical software, by 1 November . “Wilful threats of high tariffs are not the right way to get along with China ,” a spokesperson for the commerce ministry said on Sunday, according to the state news agency Xinhua. “China’s position on the trade war is consistent. We do not want it, but we are not afraid of it. “If the United States insists on going the wrong way, China will surely take resolute measures to protect its legitimate rights and interests.” Trump and senior US administration officials opened a door to a China trade deal on Sunday as market futures showed another US stock market drop. “Don’t worry about China, it will all be fine! Highly respected President Xi just had a bad moment. He doesn’t want Depression for his country, and neither do I. The U.S.A. wants to help China, not hurt it!!!” Trump wrote on Truth Social. The message came after JD Vance called on Beijing to “choose the path of reason” in the latest spiralling trade fight between the world’s two leading economies that has shaken stock markets. Dow futures showed a drop of 887 points ahead of the stock markets’ open on Monday. The index dropped sharply lower on Friday after reignited fears of a trade war with China when threatened to impose 100% tariffs on Chinese imports after China said it would restrict rare earth exports. The Dow fell 879 points, or 1.9%. “It’s going to be a delicate dance, and a lot of it is going to depend on how the Chinese respond,” Vance said on Fox News’s Sunday Morning Futures. “If they respond in a highly aggressive manner, I guarantee you, the president of the United States has far more cards than the People’s Republic of China. If, however, they’re willing to be reasonable,” he said, then the US would, too. The US president shocked the financial markets on Friday when he accused China of “very hostile” moves to restrict exports of rare-earth materials needed by US industry. It prompted heavy falls on Wall Street, where about $2tn (£1.5tn) was wiped off the value of the US stocks. China insisted on Sunday that its latest export controls on rare earths such as holmium, erbium, thulium, europium and ytterbium were legitimate. “China’s export controls are not export bans,” said the commerce ministry spokesperson. “All applications of compliant export for civil use can get approval, so that relevant businesses have no need to worry.” skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Business Today Get set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morning Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The UK’s FTSE 100 share index fell almost 1% on Friday as Trump’s threat sparked a late selloff. The futures market indicates there could be further losses in London and New York on Monday, although there could also be relief that Beijing has not yet retaliated. Bitcoin, which had tumbled 8% after Trump’s post on Truth Social, rose by 1.5% on Sunday after China refrained from retaliating. Trump’s tariff threat was “a rather unwelcome development for financial markets” as investors had “by and large moved on from the trade and tariff story”, said Michael Brown, a senior research strategist at the brokerage firm Pepperstone. “Chiefly, the question that every man and his dog are attempting to answer is whether this is a credible threat, that the Trump admin might follow through on, or whether this is another example of the ‘escalate to de-escalate’ strategy that Trump used so frequently earlier in the year. “A strategy where outlandish and ridiculous tariff figures are threatened, in an attempt to focus minds, extract concessions from the other party, and ultimately come to agreement faster than otherwise might’ve been possible.”",https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/12/china-warns-us-of-retaliation-over-trump-100-tariffs-threat,World,BBC,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cb43890e4f4ab51bed15cbbe23a8f5bf55c25672/937_0_2878_2304/master/2878.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=4b2c272e0a0a17725a46272bc924c31c",2025-10-12T13:35:27+00:00,2eb0b317e14c50e3caef0afffd4de654a999f70a
4fd9c6a0f206,Trump threatens 100% China tariffs as Beijing restricts rare-earth exports,,"Donald Trump has threatened to impose additional US tariffs of 100% on China starting next month, accusing Beijing of “very hostile” moves to restrict exports of rare earths needed for American industry. Wall Street fell sharply after the US president reignited public tensions with the Chinese government, and raised the prospect of another acrimonious trade war between the world’s two largest economies. Over the summer, relations had improved between Washington and Beijing , and Trump agreed to drastically reduce steep tariffs he imposed on China earlier this year, following negotiations between the two countries. Late on Friday, however, the president threatened to ratchet them back up by imposing a 100% tariff on goods from China “over and above” any existing tariffs. This would happen on 1 November “or sooner”, he said, hinting that the move could be accelerated should Chinese officials opt to retaliate. The US will also introduce export controls on “any and all critical software”, he added. “I never thought it would come to this but perhaps, as with all things, the time has come,” Trump wrote on his Truth Social website, claiming: “Ultimately, though potentially painful, it will be a very good thing, in the end, for the USA. “One of the Policies that we are calculating at this moment is a massive increase of Tariffs on Chinese products coming into the United States of America. There are many other countermeasures that are, likewise, under serious consideration.” A planned meeting between Trump and Xi Jinping in South Korea later this month may no longer happen, Trump suggested, saying “there seems to be no reason” to meet with the Chinese president. The US president’s threat sets the stage for another escalation in his volatile dispute with China. Just four months ago, he described US relations with the country as “excellent” after signing off on a tariff reduction deal . Trump repeatedly hiked US tariffs on Chinese goods in the spring, amid spiraling tensions between the two countries, to a peak of 145%. Beijing hit back, raising its own tariffs on US exports to 125%. But talks between officials, amid widespread concern over the impact of such exorbitant duties on the world economy, led to a fragile detente. US tariffs on Chinese products fell to 30%, while Chinese tariffs on US goods dropped to 10%. The president’s latest online attack on Beijing alarmed investors on Friday. The benchmark S&P 500 fell 2.7%, suffering its worst day since April, and the Dow Jones industrial average retreated 1.9% in New York, while the technology-focused Nasdaq Composite sank 3.6%. Shares in the tech giant Nvidia – the world’s biggest public company, with a market value of almost $2.5tn – were hit particularly hard, dropping almost 5%. Other leading global markets also came under pressure. The FTSE 100 dropped 0.9% in London. China is the world’s largest producer of rare earths, producing more than 90% of the world’s processed rare earths and rare-earth magnets. The 17 elements are critical for manufacturers of everything from electric cars to plane engines. Earlier this week, Beijing significantly expanded its export controls over rare earths, adding five new materials to its control list. Its last expansion of controls, back in April, prompted supply shortages around the world before a series of diplomatic deals helped resolve some of the issues. “I have always felt that they’ve been lying in wait, and now, as usual, I have been proven right!” Trump claimed on Friday. “There is no way that China should be allowed to hold the World ‘captive,’ but that seems to have been their plan for quite some time, starting with the ‘Magnets’ and, other Elements that they have quietly amassed into somewhat of a Monopoly position, a rather sinister and hostile move, to say the least. “But the US has Monopoly positions also, much stronger and more far reaching than China’s.” Trump’s aggressive tariff strategy is a key pillar of his policy agenda.

1c9d0d289385,Seven people killed after twin earthquakes off coast of Philippines,,"Two powerful offshore earthquakes struck off the coast of the southern Philippines on Friday, killing at least seven people, while towns near the epicentre faced structural damage and authorities warned of strong aftershocks. The first quake of magnitude 7.4, in waters off the town of Manay in the province of Davao Oriental, triggered a tsunami alert for coasts within 186 miles (300km) of the epicentre, but the warnings for the Philippines and Indonesia were subsequently lifted. A second earthquake of magnitude 6.8 struck the same area seven hours later, triggering another tsunami warning, with the country’s seismology agency, Phivolcs, warning of possible waves that could be more than 1 metre (3.2ft) higher than normal tides. People living near coastal areas in the southern Philippines were “strongly advised to immediately evacuate” to higher ground, or move further inland, Phivolcs said. The director of the agency, Teresito Bacolcol, described the twin earthquakes as a doublet – two distinct earthquakes that occurred along a massive trench off the country’s eastern seaboard. There were initial reports of damage to homes, buildings and bridges, one official in Manay said, although the full extent of the damage in the Philippines was not immediately clear. At least seven people were killed, a civil defence official, Ednar Dayanghirang, said in a briefing. The deaths were reported in towns and cities near the earthquake’s epicentre. Footage shared on social media after the first quake showed students fleeing in panic from their classrooms, radio anchors leaving their seats mid-air and people crouching and bracing themselves on all fours as the ground shook violently. Motorcycles were knocked over by the force of the tremor. map The governor of Davao Oriental said people panicked when the first earthquake struck. “Some buildings were reported to have been damaged,” Edwin Jubahib told the broadcaster DZMM. “It was very strong.” Evacuation orders were issued in affected areas, with schools suspending classes for the day. Damage to infrastructure, including cracks in the structure of the Magsaysay Bridge in Butuan city, were reported. Ferdinand Marcos Jr, the Philippine president, said authorities were assessing the extent of the damage and search and rescue efforts being prepared. “We are working round the clock to ensure that help reaches everyone who needs it,” Marcos said. The energy secretary, Sharon Garin, said officials were monitoring four electric companies in Mindanao after power supply in some areas tripped. It was not immediately clear whether the shutdowns were caused by the earthquake or were a precautionary measure. Students are evacuated in Mindanao after the powerful earthquake. Photograph: Golden Cornucopia - Davao de Oro State College/AFP/Getty Images Christine Sierte, a teacher in the town of Compostela, near Manay, told Agence France-Presse she was in an online meeting when the violent shaking started. “It was very slow at first then it got stronger … That’s the longest time of my life. We weren’t able to walk out of the building immediately because the shaking was so strong,” she said. “The ceilings of some offices fell, but luckily no one was injured.” She said some of the school’s 1,000 students “suffered panic attacks and difficulty in breathing”. Kath Cortez, a journalist based in Davao city, said the ground floor walls of her family’s house were showing small cracks. “I was surprised by the strength,” she said, adding members of her family ran out of the house. The quakes hit just 10 days after a deadly 6.9-magnitude earthquake hit Bogo City in Cebu province, which killed 71 people. Aftershocks are still being felt in the area. Neighbouring Indonesia also issued an earlier tsunami warning for its regions of North Sulawesi and Papua, according to its geophysics agency. The Philippines sits on the Pacific ring of fire and experiences more than 800 quakes each year.

ec07610592a1,US farmers caught in Trump-China trade war – who’ll buy the soybeans?,,"At the Purfeerst farm in southern Minnesota , the soybean harvest just wrapped up for the season. The silver grain bins are full of about 100,000 bushels of soybeans, which grab about $10 a piece. This year, though, the fate of the soybeans, and the people whose livelihoods depend on selling them, is up in the air: America’s soybean farmers are stuck in the middle of a trade war between the US and China , the biggest purchaser of soybean exports, used to feed China’s pigs. “We are gonna have to find a home for them soybeans some time soon,” said Matt Purfeerst, a fifth-generation farmer on the family’s land. “They won’t stay in our bins for ever.” No other country comes close to purchasing as many American soybeans as China – last year, it was more than $12bn worth. This year, the country has not purchased a single dollar’s worth, cutting off the country that makes up about half of US soybean exports. While Trump has said he intends some sort of payment to go to soybean farmers hurt by tariffs, an announcement of a specific plan is on hold while the government is shut down. He said in a Truth Social post last week that he would be meeting with the Chinese president soon and “soybeans will be a major topic of discussion”. The White House cast blame on Democrats for the government shutdown for the delay in a response to the Guardian on Wednesday, erroneously claiming they were prioritizing healthcare for migrants over farmers. Soybeans are planted near Waverly, Minnesota. Photograph: Mark Vancleave/AP “President Trump, [Treasury] Secretary [Scott] Bessent, and [Agriculture] Secretary [Brooke] Rollins are always in touch about the needs of our farmers, who played a crucial role in the president’s November victory,” spokeswoman Anna Kelly said. “Unfortunately, Democrats in Congress have stalled progress on this issue with their prolonged shutdown to serve illegal immigrants instead of America’s farmers. No decisions have been made, but we look forward to sharing good news soon.” Purfeerst’s family farm grows soybeans and corn, and has some beef cattle. The job is a round-the-clock combination of engineering, business, manual labor, environmental science. And it’s increasingly hard for family farms to make it. Costs for propane, fertilizer and seed have gone up, he said, and the prices for the goods they are selling don’t make up for the increased costs. Soybean farmers have become the “poster child out there right now of how this one particular segment’s getting hurt”, he said. The farm recently welcomed the Democratic US senator Amy Klobuchar for a visit to talk about how the tariffs were playing out, but Purfeerst said political affiliations didn’t matter. “Only 1% of the population is even involved in [agriculture] any more,” he said. “And what gets really challenging is this perception of ag out there, whether it’s on tariffs and prices or environmental issues, farmers kind of seem to be the crosshairs of a lot of it.” Farming areas voted for Trump in 2024, as did much of rural America. One analysis, by Investigate Midwest , showed Trump growing his support among farming-dependent counties in 2024 despite a trade war during his first term that negatively affected farmers. “I’m not gonna get into who I voted for particularly, but I would just have to say, at the time, you got to make decisions who you think is going to be the best leader of the country, and go on with life,” Purfeerst said. “And in four years, you get to vote again. That’s the beauty of our society. It’s not an 80-year regime. It’s a four-year cycle. It’s hard to say what’s gonna come about. I mean, everyone’s got their pros and cons.” A soybean harvest at a farm outside St Peter, Minnesota, last month. Photograph: Bloomberg/Getty Images Purfeerst has options for his soybeans: because of his farm’s location, he can sell domestically to soybean crush facilities in nearby towns, sell on the rail market, or sell in Minneapolis and put product on barges down the Mississippi River. Other soybean farmers, especially those in more remote parts of the midwest where soybeans are mostly produced, aren’t as lucky. Stories from all parts of the country where soybeans are grown have surfaced in recent weeks – in Arkansas, Illinois, Nebraska, Indiana, the Dakotas. Farmers face higher costs for inputs like fertilizer and equipment. They rely on China as a purchaser. Soybeans sitting in bins too long is subject to weather and pests. The prices fluctuate, so it’s a gamble to hold on to it that sometimes can pay off, or sometimes lose money. “Let’s say tomorrow we get a trade deal with China, and it’s favorable to soybeans. All of a sudden you might see this market jump from $10 to $12 in three, four days,” Purfeerst said. “So it makes it extremely challenging from a risk management standpoint of: when do you market your crop, and how many eggs do you put in that basket? The potential is $12, but if we don’t get a trade deal, it could go to $9 … There’s a huge volatility in soybeans.” The soybean industry has been warning for months that China’s exit from the market would be devastating, calling on the Trump administration to come up with a trade deal that spares farmers. The American Soybean Association wrote a letter to Trump in August, saying the country’s soybean farmers were “standing at a trade and financial precipice” and “cannot survive a prolonged trade dispute with our largest customer”. Tim Walz, Minnesota’s Democratic governor, declared the first week of October as soybean week, saying in the announcement that “our soybean farmers are confronting a crisis they haven’t seen since the 1980s”. “They’ve produced a bumper crop this year, just to find out they have nowhere to sell their harvest thanks to Trump’s trade policies,” Walz said. “Minnesota’s got the best beans in the world – I encourage Minnesotans to stand with our farmers and continue to advocate for federal trade reform.” It’s not the first time a Trump trade plan has hurt soybean farmers: in 2018, a trade war led to significant reductions in soybean exports to China. Since then, the market has rebounded, though China has ramped up soybean purchases from Brazil and Argentina, stockpiling imports earlier this year. Republican lawmakers have said they are sympathetic to the farmers and want to find a way to help them. James Comer, a Republican congressman from Kentucky, said this week that soybean farmers were not to blame for the problem they are facing. “They planted that crop assuming that those foreign markets were going to be there,” Comer said in a recent TV appearance . “I think we need to do something to help the soybean farmers.” A bailout is “really just a Band-Aid”, though it’s one that many farmers would welcome as they are getting squeezed right now, Purfeerst said. Most farmers would prefer an open market, without tariffs, for their products, letting the market dictate prices. They don’t want the trade war now to affect a long-term relationship that makes up a significant chunk of market share. There also should be more emphasis put on increasing domestic uses of soybeans, though a long-range plan like that won’t help the farmers who are stuck right now, he said. “There’s farms that are struggling to make money on soybean acres, and you’ve got to remember: whatever payment we’re getting, whatever that dollar amount might be, if we get anything, it’s not just going in our back pocket,” he said. “We’ve got a fertilizer bill. We’ve got to pay the seed bill. There’s a lot of payments. So really, that money might be in the farmer’s hands for a month, until it gets spent on inputs for next year.”",https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/10/trump-china-trade-war-soybeans,World,BBC,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9dc2e1a8ba0221eddd184d4216612d2e4e47a7b9/270_0_2700_2160/master/2700.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=61131a5b4de48b7f681b7bfd62427652",2025-10-10T12:00:52+00:00,8edf0dba1d9a178603345e062f13baaa1bc71c71

Burke, the minister for home affairs, said Thorpe’s remarks were “of course” unacceptable, adding he believes lawmakers should be working to turn down the temperature now that Israel and Gaza have agreed to the terms of a ceasefire deal. Burke told RN: The concept of wanting to inflame, push the temperature up, is not what anyone should be doing, least of all a member of parliament. I’m not going to respond to that by increasing the heat in the opposite direction. I really think it’s a time for just turning the temperature down because there are two things, and we’ve got a chance of getting both. There are two things that Australians have been wanting. They’ve been wanting the killing to end, and they’ve been wanting to make sure that the conflict’s not brought here. We might be looking right now at the chance for the killing to end. So, let’s also try to calm things down here. Lidia Thorpe. Photograph: Anadolu/Getty Images Burke added the world had finally reached a point with the war in Gaza where “despair is turning to hope”.

6b7bad4583cd,"Australia’s household energy bills will halve by 2050, modelling suggests",,"Australian household energy bills will halve by 2050 as solar panels, batteries and electric cars and appliances become the norm, reducing pressure on the federal government over living costs and creating room for more climate action, a thinktank study suggests. Modelling by the Grattan Institute finds that cutting greenhouse gas emissions from electricity generation in line with the goal of reaching net zero emissions by 2050 will cut average household energy costs from about $5,800 today to about $3,000. The report says a fall of roughly this magnitude will happen under existing policies as households use less gas and petrol and more clean energy. The biggest savings are expected in gas-reliant Victoria , where the modelling suggests average annual spending on petrol, gas and electricity could fall from $6,036 to $2,767. The report says emission cuts in the power sector are not happening fast enough and the mid-century net zero target will not be met without a policy requiring cuts in pollution from electricity. The Grattan Institute has called on the government to consider expanding a policy applied to major industrial polluting sites – the safeguard mechanism – to include power plants. It says this would limit household energy savings compared with what would otherwise happen, but only marginally – by about 3%. It says the safeguard mechanism is already a form of carbon pricing – language the Labor government has avoided since it lost a fraught political fight that culminated with the Coalition government under Tony Abbott abolishing a functioning carbon pricing scheme in 2014. The institute’s energy and climate change program director, Alison Reeve, said how people use energy has changed since then “and the politics of carbon pricing should change too”. “For too long, federal governments of both political colours have avoided pricing carbon because they fear higher electricity prices,” Reeve said. “Our report shows that the source of that fear is becoming outdated.” The Coalition introduced the safeguard mechanism and Labor revamped it in 2023. It requires about 200 industrial facilities that release more than 100,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide in Australia each year – including liquified natural gas plants, coalmines, smelters and factories – to reduce emission intensity by 4.9% each year until 2030. The cuts can be made either on site or by buying carbon offsets. Companies that reduce emissions below a baseline level are also given “safeguard mechanism credits” that they can sell to polluters that do not meet their baseline. Government data suggests the total direct pollution from facilities covered by the safeguard mechanism fell by nearly 2% in the first year after Labor’s revamp. But the scheme has been criticised for allowing unlimited use of offsets despite peer-reviewed studies suggesting they are failing to deliver what was promised . A review of the safeguard mechanism is planned next year. Reeve said the institute’s modelling assumed electricity companies would make direct emission cuts, and could not rely Australian carbon credits created through methods including improved nature cover. skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Clear Air Australia Adam Morton brings you incisive analysis about the politics and impact of the climate crisis Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Renewable energy in homes has boomed since the introduction of a battery subsidy in July. But investment in large-scale developments – particularly windfarms – has slowed, in part due to delays in planning approvals, construction of transmission links and supply chains. The federal climate change and energy minister, Chris Bowen, said the government was focused on delivering existing policies, including an underwriting program for large solar, wind and battery developments (known as the capacity investment scheme), the $20bn “rewiring the nation” program and the battery subsidy.

In Sydney, the Palestine Action Group said 30,000 people had marched from Hyde Park to Belmore Park in the central business district after a planned rally to the Opera House was prohibited by the New South Wales court of appeal last week. NSW police estimated 8,000 people attended the Sydney protest, with a spokesperson saying there had been “no significant incidents”. Rallies were also held in Melbourne, Brisbane and Perth on Sunday to mark two years of killing in Gaza after Hamas attacks on 7 October 2023 killed about 1,200 people in Israel.

Naser said on Sunday: “Every single time the police attempt to oppose our rallies or take us to the supreme court, it wakes up a lot of people … to the need to mobilise and stand up against it.” – Additional reporting by Australian Associated Press",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/oct/12/thousand-attend-pro-palestine-rallies-across-australia-as-organisers-vow-to-keep-protesting-after-gaza-ceasefire,World,BBC,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6909c5015935b58cf409d7262bb2b1bbb892458a/228_0_2461_1970/master/2461.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=426a1fe717e96a3f708bc314077b75dc",2025-10-12T11:51:44+00:00,b5bc1df229a3e21789dd11a768e7b4a1949c9881
a0894ff1ad81,Australian Madeleine Habib released from Israeli jail after aid flotilla intercepted en route to Gaza,,"Australian woman Madeleine Habib has been released from an Israeli prison, four days after a ship she captained as part of another Gaza-bound aid flotilla was intercepted by the Israeli military in international waters. A source close to Habib said she was released on Sunday morning Israel time, along with other activists from the freedom flotilla, and taken to the Jordan border. Habib is the eighth Australian who travelled on a humanitarian flotilla to be detained by Israeli authorities and subsequently released. Sign up: AU Breaking News email The experienced mariner and long-time humanitarian activist was arrested on 8 October and detained in Israel’s Ketziot prison for allegedly “illegally seeking to break Israel’s naval blockade on Gaza”. Australian consular officials who visited Habib in jail the following day were told she could remain in Israel “indefinitely” unless she agreed to sign a waiver. Habib had refused to sign the document. Guardian Australia understands the waiver required detainees to acknowledge they had sought to illegally break Israel’s naval blockade on Gaza. It was not known on Sunday if Habib signed the waiver before being released. Previously, at least one flotilla member who did not sign was nevertheless released, sources have said. Habib previously told Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (Dfat) officials who visited that she had experienced “degradation but no physical abuse” in custody. Habib said she had been provided access to her lawyer but had eaten only “stale bread” and drank “brown” tap water. The high-security prison in the Negev desert where she was held is known for its detention of Palestinian security prisoners – many of whom Israel accuses of involvement in militant or terrorist activities. A Dfat spokesperson earlier on Sunday said it had raised the treatment and welfare of Australians detained in Israel with Israeli officials in Tel Aviv and Canberra. “We understand that people want to help deliver aid to those suffering in Gaza – we also want to see critical aid delivered,” the spokesperson said. skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Breaking News Australia Get the most important news as it breaks Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It was intercepted days before the Donald Trump-brokered ceasefire deal was announced. The Conscience was part of a flotilla comprising nine ships, all of which were intercepted in the early hours on Wednesday morning. On Sunday, tens of thousands of Australians around the country marched at pro-Palestine demonstrations . In Sydney, the organisers suggested they would continue to march until aid organisations were let into Gaza and the strip was rebuilt. Surya McEwen , a passenger on the previously intercepted Sumud flotilla who arrived in Australia on Friday after being detained by Israel, said flotilla activists would continue to try to deliver aid by sea “as long as there is a situation where there’s a brutal and illegal blockade on Gaza”.

a1d3a5415cf3,Hackers leak Qantas data containing 5 million customer records after ransom deadline passes,,"Hackers say they have leaked the personal records of 5 million Qantas customers on the dark web, after a ransom deadline set by the cybercriminals passed. The airline is one of more than 40 firms globally caught up in the hack, reported to contain up to 1bn customer records. The hacker collective Scattered Lapsus$ Hunters released an extortion note on a data leaks site on the dark web last week, demanding payment in return for preventing the stolen data from being shared. The Qantas data, which was stolen from a Salesforce database in a major cyber-attack in June , included customers’ email addresses, phone numbers, birth dates and frequent flyer numbers. It did not contain credit card details, financial information or passport details. On Saturday the group marked the data as “leaked”, writing: “Don’t be the next headline, should have paid the ransom.” Sign up: AU Breaking News email Jeremy Kirk, analyst at Intel 471, a cyber threat intelligence company, said 44 companies had been included in the leak including Gap, Vietnam Airlines, Toyota, Disney, McDonald’s, Ikea, and Adidas. He said the hacker group was well known and operated out of countries such as the US, UK and Australia. “This particular group is not a new threat; they’ve been around for some time,” Kirk said. “But they’re very skilled in knowing how companies have connected different systems together.” A Qantas spokesperson previously told Guardian Australia its priorities were “continued vigilance and providing ongoing support for our customers” after the June attack. “We continue to offer a 24/7 support line and specialist identity protection advice to affected customers,” the spokesperson said. A Salesforce spokesperson told Guardian Australia the company “will not engage, negotiate with, or pay any extortion demand”. There was no indication the Salesforce platform had been compromised, the company said via a statement. “We are aware of recent extortion attempts by threat actors, which we have investigated in partnership with external experts and authorities. Our findings indicate these attempts relate to past or unsubstantiated incidents, and we remain engaged with affected customers to provide support,” it said. It is understood that the other global data was stolen between April 2024 and September 2025 and included personal and contact information of the companies’ customers and employees, including dates of birth, purchase histories and passport numbers. “No company wants to see hundreds of thousands, or millions, of records of their customers just on the internet,” Kirk said. “That’s awful. It’s awful for the companies. It’s awful for the people affected.” In July, Qantas obtained an ongoing injunction from the NSW supreme court ensuring protections to prevent the stolen data being accessed, viewed, released, used, transmitted or published by anyone, including third parties. Kirk said there was no financial data but criminals could potentially use leaked personal information to open credit cards. He said people should monitor their accounts for suspicious activity, and beware of scam emails that are personalised. “These days, a lot of threat groups are now generating personalised phishing emails,” he said. “They’re getting better and better at this – and these types of breaches help sort of fuel that economy, that underground fraudster economy.” Qantas said on Sunday: “With the help of specialist cyber security experts, we are investigating what data was part of the release.” “We have also put in place additional security measures, increased training across our teams and strengthened system monitoring and detection since the [mid-year] incident occurred,” a spokesperson said.",https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/oct/11/hackers-leak-qantas-data-containing-5-million-customer-records-after-ransom-deadline-passes,World,BBC,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/39f8843188c9b9c5d36605e65609209817ba4109/1035_0_7857_6286/master/7857.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=2d866c0f2753e57a6a5889ccdd1574d1",2025-10-11T05:03:52+00:00,cebc47b9779cc041d8e6d95bf89fe7ede120fda1
f3c4ddad5b94,European far right follows Trump in calling for antifa to be declared terrorists,,"Where Donald Trump leads, Europe’s nationalists and far right follow. After a Truth Social post last month, when Trump announced the US would designate antifa , the decentralised anti-fascist movement, “a major terrorist organisation” , his international allies swung into action. That same day, the Dutch parliament, where the largest party is Geert Wilders’ far-right PVV, passed a resolution, noting the US decision and calling on the government to declare antifa a terrorist organisation in the Netherlands . Then the Hungarian prime minister, Viktor Orbán – more usually a source of inspiration for Trump – said his country would follow suit. Next, in the European parliament, a far-right MEP from the Flemish nationalist Vlaams Belang party drafted a resolution with the same request. Tom Vandendriessche announced last week that 79 MEPs from 20 countries supported his proposed text. In a video posted on X with ominous music playing, he described antifa as “an international network that is supported, financed and protected by the system to fight the nationalist opposition with violence”. Experts characterise antifa rather differently, instead describing it as a loose identity movement with neither leaders nor membership structure. While it has origins in Europe , it gained attention in the US after Trump’s election in 2016. “Antifa is not what I would call an identifiable group or organisation [but] a movement, perhaps,” Jessica White, acting director of terrorism and conflict studies at the Royal United Services Institute, told the Guardian. “On the basis of that lack of clear definition, I think it’s very challenging, if not counterproductive, to try and designate it,” she added. The security services, she said, would see “the least amount of value” in such a designation, as “usually what I’ve seen is that it is much easier to reach a verdict and a prosecution based upon focusing on the actual acts of violence.” She added: “I think there’s probably a very justified sense of fear around how it could be used in a politically motivated way to target people that are seen as opponents to a more rightwing political government.” The Hungarian government has claimed that antifa, which it calls a “a leftwing terrorist organisation”, is a menace to its citizens. The EU’s law enforcement agency Europol does not use the term “antifa” in its recent Terrorism Situation and Trend report – a document cited in the far-right European parliament resolution. Europol reports 21 attacks attributed to leftwing or anarchist violent extremism in 2024, based on data from 14 countries, excluding Hungary. Nearly all the attacks, which took place in Italy and Greece, targeted property. Hungarian government spokesperson Zoltán Kovács has said antifa members have “brutally beaten people” in the street, and while some were brought before the courts, “those who did not flee justice for the European parliament have received their due.” This is a reference to Ilaria Salis, an Italian activist who became an MEP in 2024, an election that brought an end to nearly 16 months of detention in Hungary , where she was accused of assaulting people suspected of far-right sympathies. Orbán’s political director, Balázs Orbán (no relation), has described Salis as a “far-left antifa activist”. This week, Salis narrowly survived an attempt by the Hungarian government to remove her immunity, after MEPs voted by a majority of one not to grant Budapest’s request. Salis says she is innocent and will not get a fair trial in Hungary, where legal experts have long concluded that the rule of law is compromised . She told the Guardian that Hungary’s use of the term “antifa” was a way of “stigmatising whoever dissents, whoever doesn’t agree with the regime”. She added: “If being anti-fascist means dissenting with his regime, of course I am an anti-fascist.” skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Headlines Europe A digest of the morning's main headlines from the Europe edition emailed direct to you every week day Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The focus on antifa is one more common cause uniting Trump and his European allies. Pawel Zerka, a senior policy fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations, said Trump served as an important inspiration for the new right in Europe, who were willing to emulate his culture war in their own countries. In a recent report, Zerka argued that Trump and the US Maga movement are waging a culture war on Europe by aggressively promoting ideological allies on the continent and seeking to humiliate European leaders on the world stage. Trump, the report argues, provides credibility, framing and coherence to Europe’s new right, from Orbán in Hungary to National Rally leader Marine Le Pen in France, as well as critical infrastructure – conferences, media, funders and thinktanks – that “supports the formation of a Maga internationale”. The notion of antifa, “a copy-paste from the American political debate”, was another way of polarising European societies, Zerka said. “The mere fact that you can claim there is a dangerous political adversary … gives you a powerful engine to also mobilise your base and seek a certain cohesion among domestic forces.”",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/oct/12/european-far-right-follows-trump-in-calling-for-antifa-to-be-declared-terrorists,World,BBC,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/32bdf78278f49dd2b9135f1c0b253dbc81c4d55d/807_215_4205_3365/master/4205.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=1eff651ef54ccd41f3af45b889f899a2",2025-10-12T05:00:44+00:00,1dba4395daf4a9db55205e4fccf7e46007d84896
849c331b9f81,Zelenskyy urges Trump to use Gaza ceasefire momentum to broker peace in Ukraine,,"Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy , urged Donald Trump to use the momentum of the Gaza ceasefire to broker peace in Ukraine, as the two leaders spoke by phone on Saturday. Trump and Zelenskyy discussed Ukraine’s request for the US to allow the delivery of Tomahawk cruise missiles to bolster Kyiv’s ability to conduct long-range strikes inside Russia, among other issues, according to Axios . This follows Trump’s suggestion that he had “sort of made a decision” about selling Tomahawks to Nato countries in order for them to be supplied to Ukraine . “If a war can be stopped in one region, then surely other wars can be stopped as well – including the Russian war,” Zelenskyy wrote on Facebook, a day after Moscow launched a massive drone and missile attack on Ukraine’s energy infrastructure that triggered widespread blackouts in Kyiv and elsewhere. “I informed President Trump about Russia’s attacks on our energy system – and I appreciate his willingness to support us,” Zelenskyy said on X, adding that they had a “very positive and productive” discussion on “concrete agreements” for strengthening Ukraine’s air defences. The phone call took place amid mounting concern in Kyiv over both the increasing scale of Russian air attacks and Ukraine’s ability to counter ever more sophisticated aerial assaults involving hundreds of drones at a time, and more effective Russian countermeasures against Kyiv’s air defences. The commander in chief of Ukraine’s armed forces, Oleksandr Syrskyi, warned that Russia was stepping up its air raids. “New challenges await us ahead. Over the past month, the enemy has increased the number of air attack weapons and although our air defence is about 74% effective, we need to make additional efforts to cover the rear energy sector, critical infrastructure and logistics,” said Syrskyi. Earlier this week, Russia launched 465 Shahed-type attack drones and decoy drones, as well as 32 cruise and ballistic missiles, against Ukraine. The latest talks between Trump and Zelenskyy come amid ongoing discussions in Washington over whether to provide Ukraine with the Tomahawk cruise missiles Kyiv has long been seeking, a move Russia’s president, Vladimir Putin, has warned would be a “completely new, qualitatively new stage of escalation”. The phone call between the two leaders comes amid a warming of relations between the US president and Zelenskyy. The Ukrainian president said in his nightly address on Friday that Russia was taking advantage of the world being “almost entirely focused on the prospect of establishing peace in the Middle East”, and called for strengthening Ukraine’s air defence systems and tighter sanctions on Russia. “Russian assets must be fully used to strengthen our defence and ensure recovery,” he said in the video, posted to X. Meanwhile, the UK prime minister, Keir Starmer, France’s president, Emmanuel Macron, and Germany’s chancellor, Friedrich Merz, said in a joint statement on Friday they were ready to coordinate and move toward using “the value of the immobilised Russian sovereign assets to support Ukraine’s armed forces and thus bring Russia to the negotiation table”. They aimed to do this “in close cooperation with the United States,” the statement added.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/oct/11/zelenskyy-urges-trump-to-use-gaza-ceasefire-momentum-to-broker-peace-in-ukraine,World,BBC,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4d8caf0bcbed22abd1c95b86bee77d88020c1c44/2145_0_1897_1517/master/1897.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=dfdacb6be768901a4927a8087a522f0d",2025-10-11T15:41:21+00:00,a6ee5b4d74f0c21ca23bf5b631b79a2bb1531fe7
e3938fe6aa8c,The Gaza effect: how a global pro-Palestine protest movement met repression and resistance,,"T he ceasefire between Hamas and Israel has been met with joy and relief across the Middle East and beyond. Over the past two years, outrage at Israel’s war in Gaza has erupted across Europe and the US, manifesting itself in university campus protests, massive marches through countless capitals and the disruption of major sporting events. Even as hopes rise of an end to the war, international anger over Israel’s actions in Gaza, which have been deemed a genocide by a UN commission of inquiry , remains raw, as evidenced by last weekend’s huge rallies in Spain and Italy . While the fury that fuels them has been shared and ubiquitous, the demonstrations – and the authorities’ responses to them – have varied considerably from country to country. If some of the official reactions have been draconian, there have also been exceptions, especially in countries where public opinion is more openly pro-Palestinian. Free speech on trial In the US , growing pro-Palestinian activism has been met with arrests, legal action and mounting threats, offering a pretext for the Trump administration’s unprecedented attack on free speech and catalysing what many view as the country’s descent into authoritarianism. In the early months of the war, thousands of people, many of them Jewish , took part in protests. After students at Columbia University set up a pro-Palestinian encampment on campus in the spring of 2024, dozens more followed at other universities across the country. But bowing to pressure from legislators, donors, and pro-Israel critics, many universities responded harshly to the encampments, calling police on to campuses, which led to thousands of arrests . A woman shouts slogans during a pro-Palestine protest in New York. Photograph: Olga Fedorova/EPA Meanwhile, allegations of antisemitism against pro-Palestinian protests have been weaponised by the Trump administration to launch an unprecedented assault on academic freedom , including cutting billions in funding to universities, screening thousands of visa applicants for pro-Palestinian views, and the detention and attempted deportation of foreign scholars over their political views. Policing protests In the UK , the Metropolitan police have so far arrested more than 1,900 people at pro-Palestinian events, the vast majority of whom have been detained for allegedly expressing support for Palestine Action , a direct action group that has been proscribed under anti-terrorism legislation. The UN human rights chief, Volker Türk, has called for the ban to be rescinded , describing it as “disproportionate and unnecessary”. The prime minister, Keir Starmer, who described plans for protests on the second anniversary of the 7 October Hamas attack on Israel as “un-British” , has said his government will look at further curbs on protests , including potential powers to take action against specific chants at pro-Palestinian demonstrations. Starmer also urged protesters to show respect by calling off their activities in the immediate aftermath of the Manchester synagogue terror attack , in which two people died. The UN human rights chief, Volker Türk, has called for the UK’s ban on Palestine Action to be rescinded, describing it as “disproportionate and unnecessary”. Photograph: Guy Bell/Shutterstock Historic tensions In Germany , whose postwar identity has been indelibly shaped by the Nazi regime’s responsibility for the Holocaust, the protests have revealed tensions between popular feeling and the country’s longstanding solidarity with Israel . Even as public opinion has turned against the Israeli government’s relentless assault on Gaza – a recent pro-Palestinian rally in Berlin attracted about 100,000 demonstrators – successive German governments have reaffirmed the principle that responsibility for Israel’s security is part of Berlin’s own Staatsräson , or reason of state. Activists have repeatedly said that police tactics have been excessive, at times brutal, and in violation of constitutional protections of freedom of assembly and expression. Much of the dispute between pro-Palestinian demonstrators and German authorities has centred around which slogans are banned under the law as antisemitic. In May last year, a pro-Palestinian activist was convicted of condoning a crime for using the chant, “from the river to the sea, Palestine will be free”, at a rally four days after the 7 October attacks. The judge said she “could not comprehend” the logic of previous German court rulings that determined the saying was “ambiguous”, and that, to her, it was clear it “denied the right of the state of Israel to exist”. This chant however has also been widely used to call for equal rights both in Israel and Palestine. When asked about crackdowns on pro-Palestinian activism after an alleged case of brutality against an Irish protester , Berlin police this month said they had opened an investigation into the officer but denied a pattern of violence or infringement of civil rights. Artists and intellectuals have cited a chilling effect in Germany around support for the Palestinian cause since the 7 October attacks, as criticism of Israeli tactics in Gaza can be quickly smeared as antisemitism, resulting in the withdrawal of prizes, positions and public funding. Meanwhile, many Jewish leaders in Germany have described a sense of isolation over the last two years and point to a sharp rise in attacks on Jews and Jewish institutions . Liberty in question In May this year, France ’s interior ministry announced it would dissolve the pro-Palestinian human rights and solidarity collective, Urgence Palestine, stating that it condoned Hamas, called for intifada in France, and provoked hatred, violence and discrimination against Jewish people. Urgence Palestine has contested these allegations, saying that the move to dissolve it is politically motivated and part of a wider crackdown on pro-Palestinian activism. The collective has not yet been dissolved. Marie Laure Geoffray, freedoms advocacy officer for Amnesty International France , said there had been “significant repression and a silencing of voices in solidarity with Palestine” and that this was ongoing. She said it had taken various forms in France, including the banning of some street demonstrations in certain cities, the decision to dissolve Urgence Palestine, as well as legal action. Geoffray said students on French campuses had also been accused of disrupting the peace or troubling the public order. Strikes and solidarity In Italy , the extent of public opinion against Israel’s war became evident on 22 September, when tens of thousands of people took to the streets calling for an end to the conflict as part of a general strike coordinated by trade unions. The mostly peaceful event was overshadowed by clashes between police and masked protesters at Milan’s central train station, giving the prime minister, Giorgia Meloni, an opportunity to condemn the “shameful” scenes and attack her leftwing opponents rather than show solidarity with the Palestinians. Police said at least 250,000 people turned out for a pro-Palestine march in Rome last Saturday. Photograph: Alessandro Bremec/NurPhoto/Shutterstock The pressure on Meloni increased further when Israel’s interception of the Global Sumud Flotilla triggered protests across Italy nine days later. Rome’s police said at least 250,000 people turned out for a march, which came a day after more than 2 million people took part in a one-day general strike to support Palestinians in Gaza. Meloni’s government is mindful of public opinion, and in recent months has become increasingly critical of Israel’s killing of Palestinians – even as Italy remains one of Israel’s strongest EU allies. Meloni now says Italy would recognise a Palestinian state if the remaining Israeli hostages were freed and the militant group Hamas was out of government. ‘We steward ourselves’ In Ireland , which joined Spain and Norway in formally recognising a Palestinian state in May 2024, the police force, An Garda Síochána, has mostly applied a light touch to Gaza protests, which usually pass without incident. Government policy and public opinion are strongly pro-Palestinian , which creates a supportive atmosphere for marches and rallies. “Overall it’s kind of hands-off policing,” said Zoë Lawlor, the chair of the Ireland Palestine Solidarity Campaign. “National demonstrations pass off fine. In Limerick we have a demonstration every week and we never see the Garda unless the far right show up too. Otherwise we just steward ourselves.” In Ireland, government policy and public opinion are strongly pro-Palestinian, which creates a supportive atmosphere for marches and rallies. Photograph: Clodagh Kilcoyne/Reuters Police have on occasion been “heavy-handed” when dealing with sit-ins and other acts of civil disobedience but that did not compare with the “shocking” police behaviour in some other countries, said Lawlor. Ireland enjoyed greater freedom to protest than in countries such as the UK, US and Germany, but Irish policing still required monitoring, said Joe O’Brien, the executive director of the Irish Council for Civil Liberties. “We have heard testimony, including allegations of unnecessary strip-searches and a cavity search, that raises serious concerns regarding Garda compliance with human rights frameworks and national law, regulations and policies governing the treatment of people in custody.” In May, the then Garda commissioner, Drew Harris, said allegations of strip-searches were inaccurate and that his force at all times had acted professionally and lawfully. A nation mobilised Similarly, Spain has proved something of an exception when it comes to government support for protests. Not long after more than 100,000 pro-Palestinian demonstrators forced a premature, scrappy and sporadically violent end to the Vuelta a España cycle race in Madrid last month, due to the participation of the Israel Premier Tech team , senior Spanish politicians lined up to bemoan the damage the protest had done to the country’s global reputation. Figures in the conservative People’s party called the episode “an international embarrassment” and compared scenes on the streets of Madrid to “Sarajevo during the war”. But one political figure took a different line. Spain’s socialist prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, said he had “a deep admiration” for all those who had protested in a non-violent manner and for “a Spanish society that mobilises against injustice and defends its ideas in a peaceful manner”. Sánchez, who had already been fiercely criticised by his adversaries, also said he hoped the events in Madrid would lead others to reconsider whether Israel should be included in major sporting events. Last weekend, an estimated 200,000 people rallied across dozens of cities to show their solidarity with Palestine. Both the protests and the prime minister’s backing for them demonstrate the strength of public opinion in a country where, according to a recent poll , 82% of people believe Israel is committing genocide in Gaza. Sánchez’s conservative opponents have also recently begun to step up their criticisms of Israel’s conduct in Gaza , while King Felipe – hardly a habitual courter of controversy – used a speech before the UN last month to beg Israel to “stop the massacre” and end its “abhorrent acts” in Gaza.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/oct/11/the-gaza-effect-how-a-global-pro-palestine-protest-movement-met-repression-and-resistance,World,BBC,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/38bdab37cda3dc45d9796cfa4aa6dce8f61c46d2/1_0_4998_4000/master/4998.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=bac62e0a0f9fa498b064501624060ece",2025-10-11T14:04:49+00:00,09cfc77dbbfaf55aa050138c1cbd27a210a17a0f
5d2e952717d9,‘It’s a question of humanity’: how a small Spanish town made headlines over its immigration stance,,"Flanked by farmland and nestled among the deep valleys of central Spain , few in Villamalea, a town of 4,200 people, expected to find their tranquil home splashed across Spanish media this summer. “I’ve never been contacted by so many media outlets in my life,” said José Núñez Pérez, the conservative mayor of Villamalea. With a laugh, he added: “It made me question, just what have we done here?” Everyone wanted to speak to him about the same thing; a town council motion, approved unanimously and across party lines, calling on the central government to push forward with a stalled proposal to regularise undocumented migrants in Spain. “To us, it was the most natural thing in the world,” explained Núñez Pérez, as he paused to greet residents in the town’s central plaza. In recent decades, migrants from across the globe had been atrracted to Villamalea for the many jobs on offer. The steady supply of labour had helped turn the town into an agricultural heavyweight – about 70% of the mushrooms sold in Spain come from here – while also transforming Villamalea into a rich tapestry of residents whose roots trace back to 32 countries. José Núñez Pérez, mayor of Villamalea: ‘We didn’t even debate it, we were all onboard right away.’ Photograph: Pablo Garcia/The Guardian For the 11 town councillors who backed the motion to grant papers to undocumented migrants – from Núñez Pérez’s People’s party to the Socialists and the United Left – this reality took precedence over party lines. “We didn’t even debate it, we were all onboard right away,” said Núñez Pérez. “There’s a lot of work to be done here. And there could be even more – the problem for these companies is that they can’t find enough people to work.” With the town’s companies weighing up whether to bring in temporary foreign workers, it only made sense to allow those who were already here a fair chance at a foothold. “It’s not just economics, it’s a question of humanity,” said the mayor. In late August, the president of the European Central Bank, Christine Lagarde, said gross domestic output in Germany would have been about 6% lower in 2019 if it hadn’t been for foreign workers. The picture was similar across the eurozone, she said. “Although they represented only around 9% of the total labour force in 2022, foreign workers have accounted for half of its growth over the past three years.” In recent decades, migrants have been attracted to Villamalea for the many jobs on offer. Photograph: Pablo Garcia/The Guardian In Spain, where the Socialist prime minister has insisted that migration is an opportunity, a surge in arrivals has helped to make the country a bright spot among Europe’s plodding economies. Of late, even some of the most ardent critics of immigration have conceded its necessity; in June Italy’s Giorgia Meloni, the far-right leader who has long called irregular migrants a threat to Europe’s future, said her government would issue nearly 500,000 new work visas for non-EU nationals in the coming years, in addition to the 450,000 handed out since she took power. While regularisation programmes have long been used across the EU, with 43 put in place by more than a dozen countries between 1996 and 2008, in Villamalea the push to grant papers was also rooted in the town’s history. Venancio Cuenca Lopéz, president of the Villamalea Retirees Association: ‘We’re all human beings, we need to have some empathy.’ Photograph: Pablo Garcia/The Guardian During much of the 20th century, the town’s residents were forced to fan out across Europe in search of work, said Venancio Cuenca Lopéz, the head of a local retiree association. “Some of them had papers, but some had no papers, no job offers, nothing,” he said. “We can’t say: ‘Well we did it, but now we’re against it.’ We’re all human beings, we need to have some empathy.” He pushed back against claims that regularisation would push down wages. “There are companies that take advantage of undocumented workers, forcing them to work in poor conditions and paying them little. Then Spaniards can’t work because they’re competing with people who are getting paid peanuts,” he said. “So we regularise them, everyone has the same conditions.” skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Headlines Europe A digest of the morning's main headlines from the Europe edition emailed direct to you every week day Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

From the pensioners who make up about a quarter of the town’s population to the around 20% who were born abroad – the majority from Morocco or Romania – residents shrugged off the far-right’s efforts to disparage diversity. “Here everyone has their life and their world, but when we get to together we all get along,” said María Anguix García. At Villamalea’s town hall, officials are swift to cite the efforts many have made to foster integration, keenly aware that they’re doing so against a backdrop of swirling disinformation about migration. “There was a day when people who practise Islam went to the church and got to know the prayer space and then they did the reverse; the Catholics went to the mosque and experienced it,” said the mayor “And around two months later, the five religions we have in Villamalea came together to pray in the church.” When the flood of media requests poured in earlier this year, most wanted to know how Núñez Pérez reconciled his stance with others in the conservative People’s party, particularly as the leader, Alberto Núñez Feijóo, was increasingly linking immigration to insecurity. ‘I’m paid by the people of this town,’ says the mayor, José Núñez Pérez. Photograph: Pablo Garcia/The Guardian Across the country, PP politicians have entered into governments supported by the far-right, anti-immigrant Vox party. As a result, PP politicians have lurched further to the right, leading to motions such as the one recently seen in Jumilla, a town of about 27,000 residents, where the PP-led council backed a ban on religious gatherings in public sports centres that appeared to target Muslims. Núñez Pérez bristled at the comparison. “I’ve always said that I’m not paid by my party, I’m paid by the people of this town,” he said. “In my party, as in all parties, there are differences of opinion. But if you look at the wider picture, we’re not that different.” It was, after all, the PP who had carried out more regularisation programmes than any other party since Spain returned to democracy. Others in the PP had also followed in Núñez Pérez’s footsteps; in late September, about 20 miles (32km) away in the town of Tarazona de la Mancha, a similar mix of councillors, though headed by a Socialist mayor, had come together to unanimously pass their own motion calling on the central government to grant papers to undocumented migrants. Even so, Núñez Pérez knew that the fact that he was a conservative mayor backing regularisation had become a “morbid” fascination for many. “But I think it’s the most natural thing; I know what happens in my town, we live quietly, we live in peace and we learn from each other,” he said. “In interviews they always ask me about my political party. But just because someone fires a shot over there, it doesn’t mean we’re all going to do the same.”",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/oct/11/small-spanish-town-headlines-immigration-villamalea,World,BBC,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/50a7b541e661df9ac8a0a7f1ed23aee3509bd4d5/0_0_5000_4000/master/5000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=8519ce540a23af27c7254ac86ab8f72c",2025-10-11T12:00:22+00:00,b6a896363270368fb451cc0bea0298dd2d698905
d642915dba67,Number of wild bee species at risk of extinction in Europe doubles in 10 years,,"The number of wild bee species in Europe at risk of extinction has more than doubled over the past decade, while the number of endangered butterfly species has almost doubled. The jeopardy facing crucial pollinators was revealed by scientific studies for the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) red list of threatened species , which found that at least 172 bee species out of 1,928 were at risk of extinction in Europe. The number of butterflies threatened with extinction in Europe has increased from 37 to 65 since the last study, conducted 14 years ago. One species, the Madeiran large white ( Pieris wollastoni ) has now been declared extinct. “ Beyond their beauty and cultural significance, pollinators like bees and butterflies are lifelines for our health, our food systems and our economies – sustaining the fruits, vegetables and seeds that nourish us,” said Grethel Aguilar, the IUCN director general. “The latest European red list assessments reveal serious challenges, with threats mounting for butterflies and crucial wild bee species.” The causes of the rapid recent declines are the continuing destruction or damage of habitats caused by agricultural intensification and land abandonment, draining wetlands, overgrazing by livestock, and the use of fertilisers and pesticides including neonicotinoids . The fragmentation of pollinator-friendly habitat greatly increases the risk of local extinctions. Global heating is also revealed to be a major threat: 52% of all endangered butterflies in Europe are imperilled by the climate crisis – approximately twice as many as a decade ago. Up to 90% of flowering plants in Europe depend on animal pollination, according to Dr Denis Michez, lead coordinator of the wild bee assessment. “Sadly, wild bee populations are in drastic decline and cannot be easily replaced by managed colonies,” he said. “If wild bees disappear, many wild plants might be at risk too – of which flower-rich meadows and beautiful orchid species are just a few examples.” Fifteen species of bumblebee, which play a crucial role in pollinating peas, beans, peanuts and clover, and 14 species of cellophane bee, known for pollinating trees such as willows and red maples, are now classified as threatened. Simpanurgus phyllopodus , a mining bee unique to the continent and the only species of this genus in Europe, is now assessed as critically endangered – the scientific category closest to extinction in the wild. Butterflies that are only found on mountain tops are particularly vulnerable to global heating as they need to move uphill as their habitats become warmer but eventually run out of space. In southern Spain, the Nevada grayling and the Andalusian anomalous blue are among more than 40% of European endemics (only found in Europe) threatened with extinction. In the Mediterranean, species such as the critically endangered Karpathos grayling are imperilled by extreme drought and wildfires . Meanwhile, in the Arctic Circle, global heating is causing the tree line to move north by tens of metres each year, with scrub encroaching on bog and tundra. Warmer conditions also mean reindeer can no longer cross the ice to graze Arctic grasslands and keep them open. Eight butterfly species are threatened with extinction in this region, including Freyja’s fritillary and the Arctic ringlet. “ The biggest habitat for all these pollinators is flower-rich grassland and that is disappearing very fast across Europe because of all these factors,” said Martin Warren, one of the lead coordinators of the butterflies assessment. “The positive thing is that so many people care now and there’s a lot more awareness. Under the EU nature restoration legislation , all member states have to reverse the decline in pollinators by 2030, and they are going to have to start doing something. There are landowners who are interested. Let’s hope they can get the incentives that will help them on their way.” According to Warren, there is “low-hanging fruit” in terms of action for pollinators which won’t reduce food production – and may enhance it – such as farmers creating flower-rich margins around their fields. Jessika Roswall, EU commissioner for environment, water resilience and a competitive circular economy, described the conservation status of wild bees, butterflies and other pollinators as “dire”. “ Urgent and collective action is needed to tackle this threat. Together with member states, the European Commission has put in place an EU-wide monitoring system for pollinators based on the EU nature restoration regulation, which will help to track our progress. Now, we need to focus on implementation and cooperation with member states to protect our pollinators,” she said. The publication of the bee and butterfly assessments comes after the first Europe-wide assessment of hoverflies , another crucial pollinator group. Published in 2022, it revealed that 37% of all hoverfly species in Europe were threatened with extinction.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/oct/11/number-of-wild-bee-species-at-risk-of-extinction-in-europe-doubles-in-10-years,World,BBC,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7a23b03eed35572a99f28680f090b3af3aeb48c1/288_0_2880_2304/master/2880.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=91af38e921cbaa62f7eb0700a9d3bb15",2025-10-11T08:45:18+00:00,085819b7cc36044b6050637127df3d2bb2ca53c5

He added that the Middle East was now on the “cusp of a sustainable peace”. “Knock on wood we feel very confident that hostages will be released, and that the president is actually traveling to the Middle East, likely this evening in order to meet them and greet them in person,” Vance told CBS’s Face the Nation on Sunday. Vance called the first step in the implementation of the 20-point peace agreement, “a big day for their families, but I think more importantly, it’s a big day for the entire world.” He said the deal was “a very tall task” and Trump had “pursued a very non-traditional diplomacy with people who were not 40-year diplomats, but people who brought a fresh perspective to it.” “We are now on the cusp of a sustainable peace in the Middle East,” Vance added. JD Vance confirmed that Donald Trump would travel to the Middle East on Sunday to meet with Israeli hostages. Photograph: Lenin Nolly/SIPA/Shutterstock But he warned that phase two of the agreement, which includes Hamas agreeing to hand over weapons and the administration of Gaza to a Palestinian body of independent technocrats, “is going to take consistent leverage and consistent pressure from the President of the United States on down”. Vance was asked how long 200 US troops would remain in the area. “These are not troops who are going to be put in Gaza, but they’re troops who are already at Central Command (Al Udeid airbase in Qatar). They’ve been at that base for many, many years, and they’re going to help monitor and mediate this peace.” But Vance said: Inevitably, they’re going to be conflicts here. There are going to be things that the people in Gaza disagree with Israel about, and the Israelis disagree with the Gulf Arab states about. We see our role really as mediating some of those disputes and the pressure stays on everybody to achieve a durable and lasting piece. Vance predicted that Arab countries and Muslim-majority countries, including Indonesia, would provide troops to ensure Gaza’s security and that would “make it possible to rebuild, possible to dismantle terrorist networks and possible to ensure a lasting peace.” The US, he said, “is going to continue to play our mediation role, and I think that’s a very, very good place for all of us to be.” Share Updated at 10.52 EDT Key events Show key events only Please turn on JavaScript to use this feature Trump said that his Middle East trip would be “very special” as he headed to Israel and Egypt to celebrate the Gaza ceasefire and hostage release deal. “This is going to be a very special time,” Trump told reporters at Joint Base Andrews just before boarding Air Force One. “Everybody’s very excited about this moment in time.” The president continued, saying “there are 500,000 people yesterday and today in Israel and also the Muslim and Arab countries all cheering. Everybody’s cheering at one time. That’s never happened before.” He added: “Usually, if you have one cheering, the other isn’t, the other is the opposite.

Share Updated at 16.29 EDT President Biden’s national security adviser Jake Sullivan gave credit on Sunday to President Trump for the Gaza deal in an interview on CNN’s State of the Union. Sullivan, who served as Biden’s national security adviser between 2021 and January this year, said: “It’s a good thing that a ceasefire is in place, that the hostages will be coming out, and that a surge of aid will be going in. On a very human level, we should all take a moment to express gratitude for this moment and hope that everything that unfolds from here is positive. I’m feeling very good this morning, although I won’t feel totally comfortable until we see this fully implemented.” Asked if Trump deserved credit for the deal, Sullivan said: “Of course he does. I give credit to President Trump, [US special envoy Steve] Witloff, Kushner, and Rubio. These are hard jobs … Achieving something like today takes a village, determination, and hard work. I offer credit for that. The question now is whether we can ensure this sticks as we move forward. There will be no long-term solution if there is not a credible pathway to a Palestinian state, and I hope the administration will adhere to that.” Share Updated at 16.01 EDT Israel’s prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu acknowledged controversy over his handling of the Gaza ceasefire and hostage release deal Sunday, but called for their imminent release to be a moment of unity. “This is an emotional evening, an evening of tears, an evening of joy, because tomorrow our children will return to our borders,” the Israeli leader said, quoting a biblical verse. “Tomorrow is the beginning of a new path - a path of rebuilding, a path of healing, and, I hope, a path of united hearts,” he said, in a televised address. He also warned that “the campaign is not over,” adding: “there are still very great security challenges ahead of us.” Iran says it was invited to the Gaza summit in Egypt but has not confirmed whether it will attend, according to state media. Tehran confirmed on Sunday that it received an official invitation from Cairo to attend the summit in Sharm El-Sheikh but did not say if it would send a representative. At a cabinet meeting, foreign minister, Abbas Araghchi, briefed the government on Egypt’s invitation to president Masoud Pezeshkian. “Iran’s subsequent refusal, and a later invitation extended to the foreign minister,” IRNA state news agency reported, without disclosing whether Araghchi would attend. Share Updated at 14.44 EDT Hamas’ government media office is rejecting a BBC report about the deployment of 7,000 new Hamas operatives to reassert its dominance in Gaza where the Israeli military has withdrawn from. The Hamas statement says: “This information has no basis in truth.” It further says the claims “reflect deliberate misinformation and false narratives intended to mislead the public”. According to the BBC report, Hamas mobilised its security forces via phone calls and texts, informing its operatives that they were required to “cleanse Gaza of outlaws and collaborators with Israel” and to report for duty within 24 hours. Share Updated at 14.21 EDT Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy said today that he hopes a similar agreement to the Israel-Hamas ceasefire can be orchestrated to put an end to the ongoing war between his own country and Russia. “This is real success,” Zelenskyy said on Fox News. “It gives signals for us and hope that with such pressure, what president Trump used in the Middle East to make peace, and I hope that he will use the same instruments, even more, to pressure Putin to stop his war in Ukraine.” Ukraine has been at war with Russia for more than 1,300 days since Putin’s invasion in February 2022. Trump has faced particular difficulty with ending the conflict, expressing frustration on several occasions at both Putin and Zelenskyy. Israel’s army chief, Lt Gen Eyal Zamir said that the country achieved a “victory over Hamas” through the military pressure exerted over the past two years , combined with diplomatic efforts. “The military pressure we applied over the past two years, together with complementary diplomatic measures, constitute a victory over Hamas,” Zamir said in a televised statement. “We will continue to act in order to shape a security reality that ensures the Gaza Strip no longer poses a threat to the State of Israel and its civilians ...

One peacekeeper was lightly injured and received medical assistance,” a statement from the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) reads. “Before the grenade was dropped, peacekeepers had observed two drones flying near their position.” It continues: “This is the second IDF grenade attack on peacekeepers this month. It represents another serious violation of resolution 1701 and concerning disregard for the safety of peacekeepers implementing their mandate from the Security Council. We again call on the IDF to cease attacks on or near peacekeepers, who are working to rebuild the stability that both Israel and Lebanon have committed to restore.” Netanyahu’s spokesperson has responded to the strong negative reaction from the massive crowd at a rally in Hostages Square in Tel Aviv last night , where the mention of the Israeli prime minister’s name drew loud boos from a large number of people in attendance. Spokesperson Shosh Bedrosian told a press briefing today that Netanyahu “has got us to this point in cooperation and coordination with President Trump,” adding: “Prime Minister Netanyahu took risks, and those risks led us to this point.” She added: “The first phase of this plan is releasing all of our hostages, and that was a dedication and a promise he made to those families, and here I am standing today telling you that the prime minister is following through, following through on that promise.” Share Updated at 12.11 EDT The Palestinian Authority is ready to work with US president Donald Trump and former British prime minister Tony Blair on their effort to consolidate the Gaza ceasefire and start rebuilding , a senior Palestinian official told Blair on Sunday. Trump’s plan for ending the Gaza war holds out the prospect of the Palestinian Authority, based in the Israeli-occupied West Bank and led by president Mahmoud Abbas, eventually taking control of Gaza, but only after it completes reforms. Abbas lost control of Gaza to the Hamas militant group in 2007. Trump’s proposal says Hamas must end its rule of Gaza and foresees the territory being run by a Palestinian technocratic committee supervised by an international body chaired by him and including Blair. Hussein al-Sheikh, deputy head of the Palestine Liberation Organization, said he had met Blair to discuss the day after in Gaza and making Trump’s plan for “stopping the Gaza war and establishing lasting peace in the region a success”. “We have confirmed our readiness to work with President Trump, Mr Blair and the partners to consolidate the ceasefire, the entry of aid, the release of hostages and prisoners, and then start with the recovery and reconstruction,” Sheikh wrote on X.

cd882e2ed056,Tony Blair wins nod from Palestinian Authority for role in postwar Gaza,,"The former UK prime minister Tony Blair appears to have won the endorsement of the Palestinian Authority to be involved in the reconstruction of Gaza, after an exploratory meeting in Jordan. Blair met Hussein al-Sheikh, the deputy president of the Palestinian Authority (PA) and head of the Palestine Liberation Organisation executive committee, in Amman, Jordan, on Sunday. It was the first such meeting since Donald Trump announced Blair’s role in his 20-point plan . Although Blair was present in New York for key meetings with Arab leaders at the UN general assembly, this is the first attempt to test the water about his possible role with the Palestinian leadership. Hamas, which has said it will not have a future role in the government of Gaza, has opposed Blair’s involvement and the idea that any board should act as foreign guardian for Palestine . The precise powers of the US president’s proposed “board of peace” and its relationship to a technocratic committee of appointed Palestinians has yet to be clarified. In a statement, al-Sheikh said: “Today, I met Mr Tony Blair to discuss the day after the war and making President Trump’s efforts, which aim at stopping the war and establishing lasting peace in the region, a success. We have confirmed our readiness to work with President Trump, Mr Blair and the partners to consolidate the ceasefire, the entry of aid, the release of hostages and prisoners, and then start with the recovery and reconstruction.” He continued: “We stressed the importance of stopping the undermining of the PA, and especially the return of withheld Palestinian revenues, and preventing the undermining of the two-state solution in preparation for a comprehensive and lasting peace in accordance with international legitimacy.” The PA is keen that tax revenues withheld by the Israeli government are released, since this is preventing salary payments and undermining its liquidity, in violation of the Oslo accords. Israel has also threatened not to renew next month the annual waiver of terrorist financing laws, which allows Israeli banks to process transactions with Palestinian banks. Sharhabeel al-Zaeem, the PA’s justice minister, last week criticised Blair’s involvement, saying: “Is this the independent Palestinian state we are aiming for? All these struggles for all these years in order to have Mr Blair, who failed in London, who failed in Britain, who failed in Iraq, come and – with all due respect at a personal level to Mr Blair – be our guardian as if we were minors?” Blair will have to negotiate a fine line since neither the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, nor the Trump administration have yet said they are willing to work with the PA. Trump banned the PA president, Mahmoud Abbas, from flying to the UN, although reports on Sunday suggested Abbas would attend Monday’s summit in Egypt. The Trump plan did not specify when power would be transferred to a reformed PA, but at a minimum the PA would have to hold elections and show it was capable of overseeing the vast reconstruction effort. Blair has reassured the PA that its involvement is a sign Gaza and the West Bank will eventually be governed as one entity. French diplomats said they were also starting to work on a possible UN security council mandate for the planned international stabilisation force Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner, with whom Blair has a close relationship, has frequently insulted Abbas, describing him as a leader of refugee group.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/oct/12/tony-blair-wins-nod-from-palestine-authority-for-role-in-postwar-gaza,World,BBC,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bf8cba4e62f06140e2206bee094fef191b568021/595_0_4453_3563/master/4453.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=1b3070ca3b12d2fb7b1768cbc649523e",2025-10-12T18:39:04+00:00,68a598cf2f21950c5ab57db004e49e15fe9ba345
99c8aa3f104f,‘My heart is broken’: Palestinians begin searching the Gaza rubble for their dead,,"G hali Khadr spent two days pleading with his parents to flee with him to southern Gaza, warning them that it was too dangerous to stay. His father, known for being stubborn, refused. Their argument was never finished – an Israeli airstrike hit his father’s home, burying his parents beneath the rubble. On Sunday, two days after the ceasefire was announced, Khadr returned to search through the ruins of his parents’ home. He spent the day sifting through shattered concrete and twisted metal for any sign of them. All he managed to find were some shards of their skulls and parts of their hands. Ghali Khadr. Photograph: Amjed Tantesh/The Guardian “My father, a retired ambulance driver, was known for his strong will and patience. He did not know fear and was always optimistic,” said Khadr, 40, of Jabaliya in northern Gaza . Khadr took the remains of his parents to the graveyard, but found that it too had been destroyed. He decided to bury them next to the few graves that were still intact. The destruction left by Israel’s offensive on Gaza City. Photograph: Amjed Tantesh/The Guardian Like Khadr, thousands of Palestinians have returned to northern Gaza since Friday’s ceasefire with a grim task ahead of them: searching for loved ones killed weeks or months earlier in Israeli airstrikes and whose bodies are buried under the rubble. Gaza’s civil defence agency estimates that the bodies of about 10,000 people are trapped under the debris and collapsed buildings. The halt in the fighting has given the ambulance service the chance to finally start the search for the dead and give their families a chance at closure. The task ahead of the rescuers is immense given an estimated 60m tonnes of rubble across the territory. Bodies unearthed by Israeli bulldozers in the northern Gaza neighbourhood of Sheikh Radwan. Photograph: Amjed Tantesh/The Guardian Most roads have been destroyed or blocked by debris. Civil defence workers are short of heavy equipment and have to use pickaxes and sledgehammers to break through collapsed buildings. Rescue crews have to move slowly. The debris is also full of unexploded bombs and ordnance. “At first, we are focusing on collecting the corpses lying in the streets to preserve what remains of them, especially with the presence of stray dogs that have been attacking bodies,” said Khaled al-Ayoubi, 64, the civil defence chief for northern Gaza. Other rescuers are forced to dig through rubble with their bare hands. So far, they have only recovered a fraction of the 10,000 missing people and have yet to begin searching through the ruins of multistorey buildings.

Photograph: Amjed Tantesh/The Guardian If Israel permits the entry of heavy equipment in the coming days, all the bodies should be recovered within six months to a year, said Dr Mohammed al-Mugheer, 38, the director of humanitarian support and international cooperation at the Gaza civil defence agency. Many residents of northern Gaza cannot bear to wait that long. They have begun to return to their ruined homes to search for their loved ones on their own. Yahya al-Muqra, 32, from Jabaliya, believes his brother, Sharif, is dead. He lost contact with him after an Israeli airstrike on their home on 25 July. He managed to visit the razed buildingbut found no sign of Sharif’s body. “We went to check the area, but found no trace of him, as if he had vanished, the house and everything around it had turned to rubble,” Muqra said. “Witnesses said they last saw him near the house.” His brother suffered from epilepsy, and he worries that even if the airstrike did not kill him, he would have died without his medication. On Sunday, Muqra finally had the time to search for his brother, but working by himself he could find no sign of him. Palestinians search the rubble in Khan Younis. Photograph: Omar Al-Qattaa/AFP/Getty Images “I was hoping to find something that proves Sharif was there, a piece of clothing, any trace. We really need heavy machinery to search under the rubble, but these machines are unavailable,” he said. For many families, the pain of not knowing where, when or how their loved ones died is immense. They have spent months in exile from their homes, waiting in limbo for the chance to find even a fragment of those they lost, something to say goodbye to. Providing families with that chance is what drives Gaza’s rescue workers, who labour painstakingly under the intense sun while anxious families wait by their side. “Families feel that recovering the bodies of their martyrs is a way to honour them and preserve their souls, and it reassures them that their loved ones truly became martyrs and are no longer alive,” said Fadi al-Salibi, 35, a civil defence employee. Muqra hopes that the coming days will reveal something about his brother’s fate. With the cemeteries in his neighbourhood destroyed, he plans to bury Sharif in the garden of his home. “My heart is broken because my brother has not been buried yet. Even a single bone would allow us to lay him to rest and feel some relief,” he said.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/oct/12/my-heart-is-broken-palestinians-begin-searching-the-gaza-rubble-for-their-dead,World,BBC,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0c739cf30d5a1aa57f8c3f4619c8a5afc6c12ad3/495_195_3537_2829/master/3537.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=ddbfda72391352a7cfb7f39a02fad218",2025-10-12T18:05:58+00:00,26397b55c613b11fa13849ed07580fcd290295c2
08b0af2bfca9,Israel expects all 20 living hostages to be freed from Gaza on Monday morning,,"The Israeli government says it expects all living hostages held in Gaza to be released on Monday morning and that it is preparing for the release of about 2,000 Palestinian detainees, the crucial next phase of the ceasefire deal that could end the two-year war in Gaza. “We are expecting all 20 of our living hostages to be released together at one time to the Red Cross and transported among six to eight vehicles,” said the Israeli government spokesperson Shosh Bedrosian. Hostages will be driven to a military base to see their families or to hospitals if medical care is needed. The remains of deceased hostages are expected to be sent to the national Institute of Forensic Medicine for identification. An unnamed Hamas official told Al Jazeera that living hostages had been gathered in Gaza and the militant group would meet the Red Cross on Sunday night to agree the logistics of their release. The militant group holds 48 hostages, 20 of whom are believed to be alive . An international taskforce will work on finding the remains of hostages not released on Monday, with many believed to be buried under the rubble somewhere in the devastated Gaza Strip. Israel will also release nearly 2,000 Palestinian detainees, the vast majority of whom will be sent to Gaza or exiled to neighbouring countries, once Israeli hostages are back on Israeli soil. Several Hamas commanders, prominent Palestinian political figures and detained doctors whose releases were requested by Hamas were not on the list of Palestinians to be freed. The doctors Hussam Abu Safiya and Marwan al-Hams, who were detained in Gaza during the war, as well as the prominent Palestinian political leader Marwan Barghouti were not on the list. Hamas said it was still in talks with Israeli negotiators to secure their release.

Photograph: Khaled Desouki/AFP/Getty Images The hostage-detainee swap is the first step in Donald Trump’s 20-point plan to end the war in Gaza. A ceasefire has been in place since Friday afternoon, but most of the details of the US president’s proposals need to be negotiated before a lasting end to the war is established . The US president will visit Jerusalem on Monday to speak at the Knesset, as well as meeting families of the hostages. Trump will then fly to Sharm el-Sheikh in Egypt where he will co-chair a “peace summit” attended by the leaders of more than 20 countries aimed at finalising a permanent truce in Gaza. Though the path ahead for the deal was murky, Trump said he expected a ceasefire would continue. “They’re all tired of the fighting,” he told reporters at the White House, adding that there was a “consensus” on the way forward. Palestinians are desperate to see the ceasefire extend into a permanent end to the war, after two years of an Israeli campaign that destroyed most of the strip, killed more than 67,000 Palestinians and wounded about 170,000. Israel stands accused of conducting genocide in Gaza by a UN commission of inquiry and several human rights bodies. Palestinian flags flutter on top of rubble in Gaza City. Photograph: Bashar Taleb/AFP/Getty Images Israel denies the claim of genocide and says its conduct in the war, launched in retaliation for an attack by Hamas-led militants that killed about 1,200 people and took 251 hostage, constitutes self-defence. In Israel, preparations were under way to receive the hostages, who will be taken to a military base to undergo an examination before being taken to hospitals, which have run drills to prepare for the releases, using actors in place of hostages to practise. “We are very excited, waiting for our son and for all the 48 hostages,” Hagai Angrest, whose son Matan is among the 20 hostages still held in Gaza, told Reuters. On Sunday night, tens of thousands of people cheered in “Hostages Square” in Tel Aviv as the US Middle East envoy, Steve Witkoff, spoke, alongside Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner. “I dreamed of this night. It’s been a long journey,” Witkoff said. The crowd yelled praise for Trump, but booed when Witkoff mentioned the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu. Families in the occupied West Bank also prepared to receive loved ones who were being let out of Israeli jails. Israeli authorities instructed families not to be vocal in their celebrations and warned them to limit their interaction with the media. Roughly 2,000 Palestinian detainees are due to be let out around the same time as the hostages are released. About 1,700 were detainees from Gaza, while 250 were longtime prisoners of Israel, among them Palestinian leaders. About half of the 250 are to be released to Gaza or exiled to neighbouring countries, while the other half will be released to the West Bank or East Jerusalem. As preparations continued for the hostage swap, humanitarian groups geared up to send aid into Gaza. Humanitarian aid trucks enter the Nuseirat refugee camp in the central Gaza Strip. Photograph: Eyad Baba/AFP/Getty Images Cogat, the Israeli military agency that oversees humanitarian aid in Gaza, said it expected about 600 trucks to enter the strip each day, starting on Sunday. This would restore aid to around prewar levels, after months of severely restricted aid into the strip. The UN said about 170,000 metric tonnes of food, medicine and other humanitarian aid was ready to enter Gaza once Israel permits its entry. Tents, high-energy food for malnourished children and menstrual hygiene supplies were among the prioritised aid items. A spokesperson for the World Food Programme, Abeer Etefa, said that roads were being cleared and repaired on Sunday to help facilitate future aid deliveries. The restoration of aid follows months of Israeli siege on Gaza, which resulted in famine in parts of the territory, according to the world’s leading authority on food crises. At least 459 people have died of hunger over the past two years and starvation has spread through the territory since May. The restoration of regular aid is mandated by the Trump plan. The UN will once again coordinate supplies into Gaza after months of being barred by Israel from doing so. Drone footage shows destruction as Gazans reflect on returning back home – video The role of the private Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, which was meant to replace the UN in aid distribution in Gaza, remained unclear. The foundation’s logistics sites in Gaza had stopped operating after the ceasefire deal started. The GHF was widely seen as a failure, with its model of distribution marked by overcrowding and death. More than 1,000 people were shot to death by Israeli soldiers during the daily scramble to access food at the GHF sites, chaos which aid groups said was brought on the foundation’s militarised model of provision. The GHF consistently denied any wrongdoing. A spokesperson for GHF told Reuters there was a temporary closure of aid sites during the hostage transfers, but that there was “no change to our long-term plan”. The US will deploy up to 200 troops in Israel to help establish a taskforce to assist with stabilisation efforts in Gaza. No US troops will be deployed within Gaza, but will advise the taskforce, known as the Civil-Military Coordination Center (CMCC), from within Israel. The head of US Central Command, Adm Brad Cooper, met the Israeli military chief, Eyal Zamir, while travelling to Gaza alongside Witkoff and Kushner.

fef6e033179d,Survivor of 7 October Nova festival attack in Israel found dead,,"An Israeli man whose girlfriend and best friend were murdered in front of him at the Nova music festival on 7 October 2023 has killed himself days after the second anniversary of the terrorist atrocities. Roei Shalev, who was shot during the Nova attack and survived, was found dead in his burned car north of Tel Aviv on Friday night. Hours before his death, Shalev, 30, had posted a message on social media saying he felt he could not go on. “Please don’t be angry with me, please,” he wrote. “No one will ever understand me, and that’s OK because you can’t understand. I just want this suffering to end. I’m alive, but inside everything is dead.” More than 370 revellers were killed when Hamas-led Palestinian militants crossed from Gaza into Israel in the early hours of 7 October 2023 and attacked the music festival and several nearby communities. Shalev’s girlfriend, Mapal Adam, and his best friend, Hili Solomon, were murdered before his eyes as the trio tried to hide under a car. Shalev was shot trying to save his girlfriend, according to Adam’s sister, Maayan. “Roei lay next to the dead love of his life for about two hours until the army arrived and rescued him,” Maayan told Ynet last year. “She was hit by a bullet that penetrated her ribs and went into her heart – I say her heart was so big that it was impossible to miss it.” Shalev’s mother killed herself two weeks after the atrocities. According to Israeli media reports, she had been very close to Adam and was devastated by her death. Maayan Adam posted a picture of her sister and Shalev on Saturday. Its caption read: “Roei was murdered on 7 October and died yesterday. I have no words and it will take time to find them. Hope these two kids are hugging and smiling right now, hearts pressed together again.” The Nova Tribe Community Foundation, which supports survivors of the attack and their families, described Shalev as “a backbone of the community” and said he should be remembered for his bravery and kindness. “We ask to remember him for his beautiful moments, his courageous support of the community, his work as captain of the Nova Tribe basketball team and his constant devotion to helping his friends, sons and daughters of the Tribe during their most difficult and challenging time,” it said in a statement. Several secular opposition politicians – many of whom, unlike most ruling coalition members, remain active on social media during the Jewish sabbath – reacted with dismay to the news on Saturday and called for greater mental health support for survivors of the 7 October attacks. Yair Golan, the head of the leftwing Democrats party, wrote: “Roei could not withstand the pain, but others are still here fighting, coping, trying to live. We must give them all the help we can – so they don’t feel alone.” Agence France-Presse contributed to this report",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/oct/12/roei-shalev-survivor-of-7-october-nova-festival-attack-in-israel-found-dead,World,BBC,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6692abfa572c8e5bb14445d624e699112c8a8b2e/633_207_822_658/master/822.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=b9a734dbfbebf593a4dc3aa7a5694b0b",2025-10-12T12:08:59+00:00,b4d767617a0fb174ff8e380e917a12d260985fd4
9b357860186b,Heavy clashes erupt along Pakistan-Afghanistan border,,"Intense clashes erupted along the Pakistan-Afghanistan border on Saturday night, after an attack by the Afghan Taliban on Pakistani military posts led to a heavy exchange of fire and reportedly left dozens of soldiers dead. According to officials, Afghan troops opened fire on Pakistani army posts along the north-western border with Pakistan on Saturday night and seized several of the posts. The attacks came after the Taliban regime in Afghanistan accused Pakistan of carrying out airstrikes on Afghan territory, including in the capital, Kabul, earlier this week. On Sunday, Pakistan responded with retaliatory strikes, gunfire and ground raids on Afghan Taliban posts along the border. In a statement, the media wing of the Pakistan military said 23 soldiers had been killed and another 29 wounded in the attacks. They claimed that 200 “Taliban and affiliated terrorists” from the Afghan side were killed in their retaliatory strikes and that terrorist training camps had been dismantled. The Taliban spokesperson Zabihullah Mujahid had earlier claimed that Taliban forces killed 58 Pakistani soldiers in the attacks, while just nine from the Taliban side were killed. Taliban security personnel patrol in Spin Boldak, Kandahar, Afghanistan. Photograph: Qudratullah Razwan/EPA The clashes signal a new low in Afghan-Pakistan relations, which have become increasingly hostile amid claims that Afghanistan is giving a safe haven to Islamist militants carrying out an escalating number of deadly attacks on Pakistani soil. Early on Sunday morning, the Taliban government’s defence ministry said its forces had conducted “retaliatory and successful operations” along the border. “If the opposing side again violates Afghanistan’s territorial integrity, our armed forces are fully prepared to defend the nation’s borders and will deliver a strong response,” said the ministry. Pakistan’s media wing accused the Afghan Taliban of launching attacks to “facilitate terrorism”. “Exercising the right of self-defence, the alert armed forces of Pakistan repelled the assault decisively all along the border and inflicted heavy casualties on Taliban forces,” said the statement. “We will not tolerate the treacherous use of Afghan soil for terrorism against Pakistan … the state of Pakistan will not rest until the menace of terrorism emanating from Afghanistan is completely eliminated.” The cross-border strikes came after two explosions were reported in the Afghan capital and another in south-eastern Afghanistan on Thursday. The Taliban-run defence ministry subsequently accused Pakistan of “violating its sovereignty” in connection with the attacks. Pakistan has neither denied nor confirmed carrying out the Kabul strike, only stating that it had carried out “a series of retribution operations”. Analysts said recent days showed just how volatile the situation along the Afghan-Pakistan border had become. The two countries share a nearly 1,600-mile (2,600km) rugged and mountainous border known as the Durand Line, which is contested by Afghanistan. Since the Taliban returned to power in Afghanistan in 2021, the Pakistan government has accused them of giving shelter to the Pakistani Taliban, known as Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), an Islamist militant group who are behind a deadly rise in insurgent attacks in Pakistan’s border region of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. Map Thousands of TTP militant attacks – mostly targeting Pakistani police, paramilitary and army – have been carried out over the past four years, leaving more than 2,500 dead. Islamabad has grown increasingly impatient with Kabul, publicly calling on the Afghan Taliban to stop harbouring TTP militants, accusing them of turning a blind eye to training camps and giving funding and arms to TTP fighters who carry out attacks on Pakistani soil, allegations backed by UN findings. Imtiaz Gul, a security analyst based in Islamabad, said “Pakistan’s patience with Kabul had been wearing thin” as TTP attacks continued to escalate. Just earlier this week, at least three senior army officers, including 20 soldiers, were killed in attacks by the Pakistani Taliban. According to Armed Conflict Location and Event Data, there have been more than 600 attacks by TTP so far this year, the most in a decade. Gul described the clashes as a “logical conclusion of the tensions that had been brewing up between the two countries, particularly after the continuous refusal of the Afghan regime to take demonstrable conclusive action against the TTP, which is spearheading the terrorist attacks in Pakistan.” Speaking at a press conference in Delhi, where he was on an official visit to India this week, the Afghan Taliban foreign minister, Amir Khan Muttaqi, denied that Afghanistan was giving shelter to TTP fighters. “There is no safe haven for TTP in Afghanistan,” he said. Muttaqi said the situation along the Afghan-Pakistan border was now “under control” and that allies Qatar and Saudi Arabia had reached out to “express that the war should stop”. “Afghanistan has the right to keep its territory and its borders safe and so it has retaliated to the violation,” he said. “We achieved the objective of our retaliatory mission … so from our end, we have stopped.” Michael Kugelman, a South Asia analyst based in Washington DC, described the border situation as “precarious”. He emphasised that while the cash-strapped Taliban in Afghanistan “lacks the capacity to fight the Pakistani military head-on”, he cautioned that the strikes could further fuel the cross-border militant insurgency in Pakistan. “The risk is that its recent strikes in Afghanistan will galvanise TTP to carry out reprisals, which could invite further and perhaps more intense Pakistani operations in Afghanistan,” said Kugelman. “And then the cycle could play out again. There are no winners or easy long-term solutions here.”",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/oct/11/heavy-clashes-erupt-along-pakistan-afghanistan-border,World,BBC,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c78cb4d8d819810970aaa4e9b2860e65e72bb2f2/0_0_5030_4024/master/5030.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=a9abb5ed8bad2d354a16a97ed19e29b3",2025-10-12T12:29:38+00:00,ce2ba806c35f69886179dc08eb4a628c39bf78d3
d55518e9ad37,Unease at slow pace of change in Nepal one month on from gen Z protests,,"P rakash Bohora was one of the first of Nepal’s gen Z protesters to feel the sting of a police bullet. Like thousands of other young people, he had taken to the streets of the capital last month to protest against corruption and a draconian ban on social media. He had no idea that day in Kathmandu would escalate into what is now described as Nepal’s gen Z revolution, which saw the toppling of the government within a day, the dissolution of parliament and appointment of a new interim prime minister, the anti-corruption hardliner Sushila Karki, by the end of the week. Bohora was outside the parliament building in Kathmandu on the morning of 8 September when he heard the sound of gunfire and felt pain in his left leg. As his friend carried him to the nearby hospital, his bloodied trainer was left behind amid the pandemonium. A photograph of the shoe later went viral, an evocative symbol of the deadliest day of protest in Nepal’s history, with 19 protesters killed. Demonstrators outside Nepal’s parliament building on 8 September. They had gathered to protest against corruption and a draconian ban on social media. Photograph: Prabin Ranabhat/AFP/Getty Images One month on, Bohora is still in hospital as doctors fight to save his leg. Sitting in the trauma ward, he expressed frustration at the what he saw as the slow pace of change for Nepal since the gen Z uprising, for which he paid such a heavy price. He was among those calling for the former prime minister KP Sharma Oli and the former home minister Ramesh Lekhak to be arrested for alleged corruption and their role in the shooting of protesters by police on 8 September. “It’s been a month since the movement began, yet many of our demands remain unmet,” Bohora said. Bohora had had been driven to protest in anger at a system that seemed to be making the politicians and their children wildly rich while he had faced unemployment and exploitation. Despite qualifying as a health assistant eight years ago, there was no work for Bohora in Nepal’s struggling job market and he eventually travelled to Russia for further studies. But after running out of money, he found himself coerced into joining the Russian army , fighting on the frontlines in the Ukrainian city of Donetsk. He saw friends killed and maimed. He finally escaped back to Nepal 18 months later. “I was lucky to return home alive,” Bohora said. “After coming back, I took to the streets hoping for a better country, free from corruption.” Many of the young people who took to the streets on 8 September say they simply wanted to raise their voice against corruption and never intended to bring about wholesale regime change – let alone be tasked with deciding the next prime minister and future of the country. Their movement had no single leader , no manifesto and no singular set of demands, and still largely remains that way. Even the decision to champion Karki, a former chief justice, as their choice of interim prime minister came after she emerged as a favourite in online discussions and polls held by thousands of gen Z protesters on the social media platform Discord. Nepal’s new interim prime minister, Sushila Karki, is an anti-corruption hardliner. The legitimacy of her government has been questioned by the country’s biggest political parties. Photograph: Monika Malla/Reuters With elections promised for March, Karki is under mounting pressure from gen Z groups to demonstrate that she will crack down on corruption as promised. Yet major bureaucratic obstacles remain in implementing large-scale reform, and the lack of any high-profile arrests of former ministers from Oli’s government is a growing bone of contention. “Right now, our main demand is to control corruption,” said Amit Khanal, 24, of the Gen-Z Movement Alliance. While there are no gen Z figures appointed to Karki’s cabinet yet, Khanal said they remained in close talks with the government. “This government was formed under special circumstances, and it must investigate the major corruption scandals, especially those involving former top leaders,” he said. “If no investigation is carried out, the entire purpose of this massive movement will be meaningless.” Om Prakash Aryal, whom Karki appointed as home minister, said one of the interim government’s first moves had been to “remove the obstructions and disconnect the political links” that had prevented the most powerful political figures from being investigated for corruption. “The environment is being created so the commission can accept complaints about anyone and investigate,” Aryal said. He emphasised that it would take time for authorities to carry out a full independent investigation into the decades of alleged graft, but added: “At the same time, there are things that must be acted on immediately. The government will not let impunity have room.” In the backdrop are growing efforts by Nepal’s biggest political parties – Nepali Congress, the Communists and the Maoists – to question the legitimacy of Karki’s interim government. After parliament was dissolved, all three parties released statements calling the move unconstitutional and dangerous. In a notable break from tradition, none attended Karki’s swearing-in ceremony. In an inflammatory speech this week, Oli accused Karki and the gen Z protesters of ulterior motives. “There is an attack on this country,” he said. “There is an attack on the sovereign power of this country. There is an attack on its territory. There is an attack on the country’s interests.” Analysts warned that the gulf between the interim government and the political parties could spell bad news for Nepal’s political stability and the success of its elections in March. Lok Raj Baral, a professor of political science and former ambassador to India, said that rather than casting blame, the gen Z uprising should be a moment of reckoning for Nepal’s political old guard. “This is an opportunity for old parties to correct themselves, to transfer leadership, to renew and regain their credibility,” he said. “The old leaders were busy fighting for their chairs. They should have now learned their lesson.” Quick Guide Contact us about this story Show The best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.

85fc1de188b5,Keir Starmer to look at India’s digital ID system during visit to Mumbai,,"Keir Starmer is to examine India’s digital ID system on his visit to Mumbai as a potential model for the UK, praising the system as a “massive success”. Speaking on his two-day trip to Mumbai, where he met an expert on India’s digital ID system, Starmer defended the introduction of a similar measure in the UK, saying he believed the rollout of a voluntary system could be expanded to school applications, mortgages and driving licences. Starmer met Nandan Nilekani, the non-exec chair of the tech company Infosys, to discuss the speed of the rollout in India and the transformation of the benefits system, which has cut bureaucracy – but also caused significant contention over the exclusion of some minorities. India’s version of the scheme – Aadhaar – has been introduced over the past 15 years to almost all of its 1.4bn citizens. Starmer’s spokesperson said the meeting was not about a potential commercial arrangement with Infosys, adding that the government aimed to build its own version of the scheme in the public sector. But his interest in the Indian scheme will be taken as another sign that the government hopes the ID scheme will be part of the UK benefits system in time. Speaking to reporters en route to Mumbai, Starmer said he hoped digital IDs, which have plummeted in popularity since his announcement, would regain public confidence because of the convenience they could provide. “I don’t know how many times the rest of you have had to look in the bottom drawer for three bills when you want to get your kids into school or apply for this or apply for that, drives me to frustration,” he said. “I do think that we could gain a significant advantage. We’re going to a country, India, where they’ve already done ID and made a massive success of it. So one of the meetings I’ll be having is about ID, in relation to that.” Keir Starmer speaks to the British high commissioner to India, Lindy Cameron, and the British deputy high commissioner for western India, Harjinder Kang, in Mumbai. Photograph: Leon Neal/Reuters The digital ID system in India is far more extensive than that announced by the UK government and holds biometric data as well as residential and contact information. Government sources said there was no intention to copy the system, but to examine the way it was used and implemented, handling 80m transactions a day. It is considered a success, albeit with controversial implications, with estimates it has saved the Indian economy about £11bn in administration and corruption costs. Citizens are given a 12-digit identifying number, which replaces the need for multiple layers of paper documentation to prove their status when they take out bank accounts or apply for state benefits. Prior to the scheme, millions of babies would routinely not be registered at birth, leaving people struggling to access benefits or ways to prove their existence later in life. Critics of the Indian scheme said it was introduced with little protection for personal data, and has caused problems among the poorest citizens, with some said to have been denied medical care or benefits for not having the ID. Phone companies and banks have in some instances threatened to shut down accounts not linked to ID numbers, though a supreme court ruling has said it should not be mandatory for private services or education. Activists have also reported it being used to disenfranchise Muslim voters in the north of the country. Starmer’s spokesperson said the meeting was held because it was “useful to hear from the Indian experience; it has a very different inception and a different system, but it is used 80m times a day”. Protesters gather near Downing Street to voice their opposition to the plans for digital IDs. Photograph: Dan Kitwood/Getty Images Asked about some of the controversies with the Indian system, he said the UK system would have a different design – there are no plans to use biometric data so far. “One of core priorities is inclusivity and that’s what the British consultation will be about,” he said. Starmer said the scheme was essential to tackle illegal working, as the ID would be mandatory for employment, but that he hoped it would become a voluntary convenience measure for most British citizens. skip past newsletter promotion Our morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it matters Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Rightwing parties have put the spotlight on gig economy companies such as UberEats and Deliveroo, where migrant workers have been able to use false identities to work. “We have to have returns agreements with countries, as we’ve got with France, and we need to address the fact that too many people can come to this country and work illegally,” Starmer said. “And that’s why ID mandatory for working is really important. “There is a case to be made about the benefits for voluntary ID into other areas, and obviously we need to make that case. I think it’s a really important discussion for us to have. So on the one hand, it’s mandatory for work, but I actually think it would be a good passport.” The government has not identified any private provider that can take part in the scheme, with the tech company Palantir saying it would not do so because the plan was not in the Labour manifesto and therefore had no mandate. All opposition parties have said they would oppose the scheme, and there remain significant misgivings among some Labour MPs about the possibility of snowballing costs and data breaches. Net support for digital ID cards fell from 35% in the early summer to -14% at the weekend after Starmer’s announcement, according to polling by More in Common.

The prime minister told a business delegation of more than 120 chief executives and cultural leaders that he hoped each one of them would have a deal to sign by the end of the trip. On a visit to a Bollywood production studio, Starmer announced three new Bollywood blockbusters would be made in the UK from next year by Yash Raj Films, creating more than 3,000 jobs. No 10 said deals signed during the trip would create about 7,000 jobs through Indian investment in the UK. Speaking at a visit to a football ground, Starmer denied business leaders had been pressing for liberalisation of visa rules. “None of them have raised with me the question of visas. That wasn’t part of the FTA (free trade agreement),” he said. “What this is about is providing opportunities for them to take advantage of the FTA, and even before it’s fully enforced, the mood is very, very strong between India and the UK.”",https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/oct/08/keir-starmer-india-digital-id-visit-mumbai,World,BBC,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/116950a317872360e58643c4079af16071a2c7d7/926_522_3453_2763/master/3453.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=9733965b9667ddda6a3170edf2ede5d0",2025-10-08T21:00:05+00:00,eaf49319adec7cea55c01b0de9a7a2c8f45a27ec
eaff1c250fb1,Paraglider bomb attack by Myanmar military kills at least 20 at protest,,"A Myanmar military operation that used a motorised paraglider to drop bombs on a village this week killed at least 20 people including children and injured dozens more, according to witnesses and local media. The attack hit Chaung U, in Sagaing region, during a national holiday. Myanmar has been engulfed in armed conflict since the military seized power in 2021 and the village has been a key battleground in the war. “I saw body parts [scattered] everywhere,” a resident told the Democratic Voice of Burma news service. Witnesses said it was hard to distinguish civilians from anti-junta fighters among those killed. The bombs were dropped from a paraglider fitted with a small engine, a low-tech and cheap weapon of a type that the Myanmar junta has increasingly deployed this year to intensify its aerial campaign against those opposing it. The victims were holding a sit-in protest against the military regime during a ceremony to celebrate the Thadingyut festival, the country’s biggest Buddhist holiday. A local resident who attended Monday’s ceremony told the Associated Press that people began to flee after hearing reports of an approaching paraglider but it arrived sooner than expected. The paraglider returned later the same evening to drop more explosives. Footage of the crowd’s desperate scramble to help the wounded and locate missing loved ones circulated on social media. Amnesty International said the attack underscored the need to protect Myanmar residents. “The international community may have forgotten about the conflict in Myanmar, but the Myanmar military is taking advantage of reduced scrutiny to carry out war crimes with impunity,” said Joe Freeman, Amnesty’s Myanmar researcher. The military has not acknowledged carrying out an attack in the area. Myanmar’s generals have been fighting a civil war that erupted after they seized power in February 2021 from the elected government of Aung San Suu Kyi. Much of the country, including the village where the attack took place, is under the control of armed opposition groups. The junta has declared elections for 28 December but a UN expert has dismissed the plan as a “fraud”. Anti-junta opposition groups are barred from running or are refusing to take part. Last month UN investigators released a report saying that the “frequency and brutality” of atrocities inside the country had continued to escalate, more than four years after the coup. The investigators said they had gathered significant evidence that there was systematic torture inside prison facilities, including beatings, electric shocks, strangulation, torture by pulling out fingernails with pliers, and forms of sexual violence, including rape and gang-rape.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/oct/08/paraglider-bomb-attack-by-myanmar-military-kills-people-at-protest,World,BBC,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ac31109fe8dab7a252ade97b322fbe8f5f523567/292_0_2917_2334/master/2917.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=b04ff232654ce74d0d5dcb0b6445fc6d",2025-10-08T13:38:29+00:00,01c13c265fe532856947719fd0e697928e0f7521
9c99023e335c,Mount Everest hikers describe ‘extreme’ conditions as huge rescue effort continues,,"Trekkers have described facing “extreme” conditions after an unseasonable snowstorm during one of China’s busiest holiday weekends stranded hundreds of people on Mount Everest , prompting a massive rescue effort. Chinese authorities said about 350 people had made their way down but at least 200 remained stranded at the Everest Scenic Area, to the east of the mountain, on the Tibetan side of the border. Crowds of tourists had travelled to the region for “Golden Week”, an eight-day holiday period in China. But Chinese authorities, which control the Tibetan Autonomous Region, said heavy snowfall had hit the area on Friday and Saturday night, trapping hundreds of people at campsites at an elevation of more than 4,900 metres (16,000ft). “It was the most extreme weather I’ve ever faced in all my hiking experiences, without question,” Dong Shuchang, a Chinese trekker, said on Weibo, describing a “violent convective snowstorm on the eastern slope” of Everest. “I looked up in the middle of the night and saw that the snow had nearly covered the top,” said another trekker on Xiaohongshu. “It was the first time I truly felt the fear of being buried alive.” One Chinese trekker said their group had been “too scared to sleep” on Saturday as snow quickly piled up around their tents, forcing them to clear it every 90 minutes. They decided to descend on Sunday as the weather worsened. “ On the way, we met our guide’s father, who had come looking for him. That’s when we learned the snow was heavy in the valley, too; villagers, unable to contact their children on the mountain, were extremely worried.” Map The northern and eastern side of Everest is more accessible than sites on the Nepal side of the border, and draws high numbers of visitors for less technical trekking, without summiting the peak. Photos and video posted online showed tents buried in snow, and lines of trekkers walking through waist-high drifts to get down the mountain. “The snow was very deep, and the trail extremely slippery. Trekkers stumbled frequently – some fell, others were bumped by yaks,” said one, who added that all safely descended and were picked up by bus. By Sunday afternoon, about 350 people had reached Qudang, a small town about 30 miles away from the Tibet-side base camp of Everest, “in good health”, state media reported. At least 200 more were still stranded, but had been contacted, the reports said. Jimu News reported that hundreds of rescuers had gone up the mountain to help people and clear snow from blocking the way out. There was little official reporting or updated information about the rescue effort on Monday. It was also not clear if the weather had affected anyone on the northern side of Everest, also in Tibet. The region is tightly controlled by the Chinese government, and journalistic access restricted. The weather also appears to have affected local communications, with calls to local businesses not connecting. Several trekkers said power was out in Qudang when they arrived. October is a peak season for the area, with usually clear and mild weather, but Chen Geshuang, one of 18 members of a trekking group that made it back to Qudang, said that the weather this year was “not normal”. “The guide said he had never encountered such weather in October. And it happened all too suddenly.” The local tourism authority said ticket sales and entry to the Everest Scenic Area were suspended from Saturday. Neighbouring countries were also hit by extreme weather. Heavy rains triggered landslides and flash floods that have blocked roads, washed away bridges and killed at least 47 people since Friday in Nepal.

5ee881316ef0,UK small businesses and charities say nuclear levy could add thousands to bills,,"British charities and small businesses have warned that a new levy on energy bills, intended to support the government’s nuclear power ambitions, could raise their costs by thousands of pounds a year. The extra charge could mean a significant cost hike for charities and small businesses with high energy use, meaning community services may be cut and economic growth curtailed, according to trade groups. For most charities, the levy, which takes effect in November, will mean an increase in costs of between £100 and £240 a year, but some could experience increases of up to £2,500, according to Social Investment Business, an organisation that offers loans and financial support to charities. Nick Temple, the chief executive of Social Investment Business, said: “Adding yet more charges on top of charity electricity bills penalises our most vital community spaces at a time when they are already struggling.” For small business, including those in hospitality, the extra costs could undermine growth in the UK economy and make the shift from fossil fuels to low-carbon electricity more expensive, according to trade associations. The levy is designed to pay back investors in the Sizewell C nuclear project in Suffolk while the power plant is under construction. Households can expect the levy to add about £12 a year to their energy bills, but organisations with high energy use will shoulder a greater cost burden. This will have a disproportionate impact on smaller businesses and charities with high energy demands because energy intensive industries such as steel, cement and glass-making have been granted exemption. A Bristol-based community arts organisation, Spike Island , has been told to expect a hike of £1,ooo a year from the nuclear levy alone. The company, which provides subsidised studios for underrepresented artists, expects the extra costs to put a strain on its work. Kate Ward, the deputy director at Spike Island, said the rise in electricity costs would prevent the charity from switching to low-carbon heating, such as heat pumps, while increasing its overall running costs and putting its work with artists at risk. “The government needs to rethink how they approach electricity bills to make it viable for more charities and small businesses to make the right decisions for the planet,” Ward said. Business groups have also said that the costs are a “huge concern” for smaller companies, which they say will be forced to carry a disproportionate cost burden because larger companies were given exemptions. Craig Beaumont, the executive director of the Federation of Small Businesses (FSB), said: “Small businesses are already feeling the strain from increasing utility bills, with many saying it’s now holding back their growth. Further increases to non-commodity costs will only add to this pressure. “The government is protecting high-intensity users against these hikes, but as a result small firms’ bills are due to shoot up. This is in effect a cross-subsidy. Local small businesses should not shoulder such a high proportion of the costs themselves.” Kate Nicholls, the chair of the trade body UKHospitality, said: “This is yet another example of hospitality businesses subsidising other sectors. It’s not just the nuclear levy, but also the energy discounts for large, energy-intensive manufacturers, which will be offset by higher bills for community pubs and neighbourhood restaurants. “The constant focus on the needs of the industrial strategy sectors is having real-world impacts for the other 70% of the economy. Adding yet another cost on to hospitality businesses will only put further pressures on prices at the bar, which will fuel inflation.” A government spokesperson said: “Thriving small businesses and charities are at the heart of our communities, which is why we have extended business rates relief, supporting economic growth across the country and support for those who need it most. “The only way to bring down energy bills for good is with the government’s clean energy superpower mission , which will also secure thousands of good, skilled jobs and billions in investment.”",https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/oct/12/uk-small-businesses-and-charities-say-nuclear-levy-could-add-thousands-to-bills,World,BBC,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fc5d48038b2acebba2cd8cca95e687c593a615ed/300_0_1500_1200/master/1500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=542a931edc19361103971e2ed5ee6fb7",2025-10-12T15:29:53+00:00,f869fec3cc0451f920ad35d090d3e559b2503440
fae0a849c1fa,"Trump ‘looking at all options’ amid threats to invoke Insurrection Act, Vance says",,"The White House is talking about invoking the Insurrection Act that would allow the deployment of military troops on US soil to quell domestic unrest amid legal challenges over the moves, JD Vance confirmed on Sunday. Vance was asked on NBC News’s Meet the Press whether Donald Trump was seriously considering invoking the emergency power to deploy national guard forces and even the US military in domestic settings. “The president’s looking at all of his options,” he said, adding that “we are talking about this because crime has gotten out of control in our cities”. Trump’s attempts to use federal national guard forces in Democratic-run cities has faced challenges in the courts, most notably in Chicago in recent days. The vice-president’s ominous remarks came days after Trump referred to the Insurrection Act from the Oval Office, bluntly stating : “If I had to enact it, I would do that.” Military forces are forbidden from engaging in law enforcement duties on home soil. But under the Insurrection Act , which was signed in 1807, the president can deploy them domestically in cases of insurrection or rebellion, violence that is preventing the functioning of federal laws. The power was used during the 1960s civil rights movement during clashes over desegregation of the south but since then has been very rarely activated. The last time a president called on it was in 1992 when the governor of California requested military aid from George HW Bush in response to civil unrest in Los Angeles. In Sunday’s Meet the Press interview, Vance said Trump “hasn’t felt he needed to” invoke the Insurrection Act up to this point. But he confirmed that it was among the tactics being considered as the administration continues to be stymied in federal courts from deploying federalised national guard forces in Democratic-run cities . Federal courts have blocked the White House from using troops in Oregon and Illinois. On Thursday a federal judge prohibited the deployment of federalised national guard personnel in Chicago, admonishing the administration that she had “seen no credible evidence that there is a danger of a rebellion in the state of Illinois”. National guard troops have been sent into Illinois by the Trump administration from both Texas and California but under the temporary court order cannot be put out into the streets. Vance told NBC News that options such as the Insurrection Act were being considered because “there are places in Chicago where people are afraid to take their children … for fear of gun violence, for fear of gang drive-by shootings”. In a separate interview with This Week on ABC News, Vance said that Chicago had been given over to “lawlessness and gangs” and had a murder rate “that rivals the worst places in the third world”. In fact, violent crime has been falling at unprecedented rates in America’s biggest cities including Chicago over the past two years. Chicago is not in the top four large US cities with the highest murder rates – all of whom are in states controlled by Republicans. As Vance did the rounds of Sunday’s political talkshows, tension between the Trump administration and the Democratic states it is targeting exploded across TV screens. The vice-president was repeatedly asked by George Stephanopoulos on ABC News whether the Democratic governor of Illinois, JB Pritzker, had committed a crime that could see him being prosecuted by the Department of Justice as have several other of Trump’s “political enemies”. Vance skirted the question until he was pressed into saying: “He should suffer consequences. Whether he has violated a crime I would leave to the courts, but he has certainly violated his oath of office and that seems pretty criminal to me.” Pritzker responded to the veiled threat by accusing Vance of coming out with a “tidal wave of lies”. The governor told This Week that he was not intimidated by the prospect of prosecution as has befallen the former FBI director James Comey and the New York attorney general Letitia James , who have both been indicted in recent days. Pritzker said: “I am not afraid. Do I think he could do it? He might. But as I have said before, come and get me. I mean, you’re dead wrong, Mr President and Mr Vice-President, and I will stand up for the law and the constitution.” Raw emotions were widely on display across the TV studios as the federal government shutdown entered day 12. The Republican House speaker, Mike Johnson , told Fox News Sunday that the crisis had been orchestrated by Democratic leaders in Congress as a partisan move “so that they can prove to their Marxist base that they are willing to fight Trump”. He said that after eight attempts to reopen the government had all failed in votes in the Senate, the shutdown was causing “real pain for real people – and the Democrats don’t seem to care”. On the same program, the House minority leader, Hakeem Jeffries, denied that the Democratic stance was partisan. “We will sit down with anyone, any time, any place, go back to the White House, to have a bipartisan discussion about reopening the government,” he said. The Democrats’ aim, Jeffries added, was to “improve the quality of life of the American people and address the healthcare crisis that threatens tens of millions of people across the country”.",https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/12/trump-vance-insurrection-act-military,World,BBC,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9e3d13c398ed2344b76f5e8db12a6cc1448c4dfb/599_0_6880_5504/master/6880.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=e85daefd2ea6beab1991805327045e5d",2025-10-12T18:07:36+00:00,2fc5c9206c6941375cb3d6dbab595fe40ad406ad
c89fc0317d9b,Former NFL star Mark Sanchez ‘focused on recovery’ after jail appearance over stabbing incident,,"Former NFL star Mark Sanchez says he is “focused on my recovery” after being booked and released from jail over an incident last weekend during which he was stabbed and another man was left with significant injuries. Sanchez was processed at Marion County Jail on Sunday after his release from hospital. A judge ruled Sanchez had to undergo the processing before he is allowed to leave Indiana. “I am just focused on my recovery and I want to thank the first responders,” Sanchez told CBS/Fox Indianapolis journalist Max Lewis outside Marion County Jail. The 38-year-old then appeared to grow emotional as he thanked the surgeon who operated on him “she saved my life … I’m grateful for that”. Asked about the injuries to his torso that he suffered during the incident, the former New York Jets quarterback said: “I’m recovering slowly, it’s a long process”. Sanchez faces a felony battery charge over the incident last weekend. Sanchez, who was in Indianapolis to cover the Colts game with the Raiders for Fox Sports, was involved in a confrontation with a 69-year-old truck driver, Perry Tole, in the early hours of Saturday morning. Tole, who was left with a deep laceration to his face, said he feared for his life during the incident and pepper sprayed and stabbed Sanchez. Police say the incident happened after a dispute over a parking space. Sanchez could face up to six years in jail if he is found guilty of the battery charge. He is due to attend a court hearing on 5 November. Tole has also filed a lawsuit against Sanchez, with his lawyers saying their client suffered “severe permanent disfigurement, loss of function” and emotional distress. Sanchez has pleaded not guilty to the charges against him, which also include battery with injury, public intoxication and unlawful entry of a vehicle. Fox Sports has yet to address Sanchez’s long-term future with the broadcaster. The Jets picked Sanchez with the fifth overall selection in the 2009 NFL draft after he enjoyed a successful college career in his native California. He led the Jets to two AFC Championship games before spells with several teams, including the Philadelphia Eagles and Dallas Cowboys. He announced his retirement from the NFL in 2019 and soon after began working with ESPN’s college football coverage before transitioning to Fox.",https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/oct/12/mark-sanchez-nfl-stabbing-incident-hospital,World,BBC,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/45519f5ed03bfaf2238291b8053b47d36221ca82/0_172_5993_4796/master/5993.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=46e068908378f1fca24272708a270e7a",2025-10-12T17:18:32+00:00,7fcc81468e7777f72d13541e683c44694f8bda9b

The shooting occurred early Sunday at Willie’s Bar and Grill on St Helena island, officials said. A large crowd was at the scene when sheriff’s deputies arrived and found several people suffering from gunshot wounds. “Multiple victims and witnesses ran to the nearby businesses and properties seeking shelter from the gun shots,” the Beaufort county sheriff’s office said in a statement on the social media platform X. “This is a tragic and difficult incident for everyone. We ask for your patience as we continue to investigate this incident. Our thoughts are with all of the victims and their loved ones,” the statement said. Four people were found dead at the scene, and at least 20 other people were injured. Among the injured, four were in critical condition at area hospitals. The victims’ identities were not released. “COMPLETELY HEARTBROKEN to learn about the devastating shooting in Beaufort County,” US Representative Nancy Mace posted on X. “Our prayers are with the victims, their families, and everyone impacted by this horrific act of violence.” St Helena island is known as an epicenter of a culture of people descended from African slaves known as Gullah Geechee. The bar and grill where the shooting occurred describes itself as serving authentic Gullah cuisine.

Heavy rain also was forecast for south-east New England, the New York City area, and some has fallen in coastal sections of South Carolina , Oravec said. In North Carolina’s Outer Banks, an area that has seen significant storm damage this season, ocean overwash was starting to come across highway 12 at a motel near Buxton, the Dare county sheriff’s office posted online Sunday. The office urged travelers to be cautious and put property owners on alert as high tide approached. All of New Jersey has been under a state of emergency since Saturday night. It is expected to last into Monday, authorizing the state’s emergency services personnel to be activated as necessary. Parts of the state are forecast to experience moderate to major coastal flooding, inland flash flooding, winds up to 60mph (97kph), up to 5in (about 13cm) of rain and high surf, potentially causing beach erosion. Some volunteers were putting sandbags at beaches. The National Weather Service placed New York City, Long Island and southern Westchester county under a coastal flood warning and wind advisory through at least Monday afternoon. Coastal areas of suburban Long Island could see flooding, with up to 3in (about 8cm ) of rain and lashing winds expected, the weather service said. Wind gusts of more than 30mph (48kph) were already being recorded in the region on Sunday morning. Utilities in the area have added more than 1,600 workers to respond to the storm. “With high wind warnings and flood risks, staying alert, vigilant and taking steps to prepare is crucial for everyone’s safety,” the New York governor, Kathy Hochul, said in a statement.

e729d49ea113,Maga figures back Bukele’s call for Trump to crack down on US judges,,"Donald Trump is not known for taking advice, especially from foreign leaders who often seek to flatter and compliment the US president. But El Salvador’s authoritarian leader Nayib Bukele has followed a different tack by calling on the Trump administration to follow his example in impeaching “corrupt judges”. His call for Trump to take action against the US judiciary also received support from Maga figures, including an X post by one-time close Trump ally Elon Musk , who has in the past boosted Bukele’s calls to impeach US judges. Experts say Bukele’s latest intervention comes at a time of unprecedented threats to judicial independence and individual judges in the US, and in a period where the Trump administration is employing the same authoritarian tactics used by authoritarians in countries such as Turkey, Hungary, India and Bukele’s own El Salvador to subvert democratic accountability. Bukele’s online call last week was just the latest in a long series of taunts and allegations he has made against the US’s legal system, including a March claim that the US was “facing a judicial coup”, and his mockery of a federal judge’s order to halt deportation flights sending accused illegal immigrants to his country’s brutal prison system. Bukele’s impeachment call was also made amid social media attacks on Oregon federal judge Karin Immergut by presidential advisor Stephen Miller, attorney general Pam Bondi, Musk, and Trump himself in a recent press gaggle. Immergut had issued restraining orders preventing Trump from mobilizing the national guard, first in Oregon then in California. Trump has been gunning to send troops into Portland, which the president has characterized as “war-ravaged” on the basis of small, non-violent protests outside the city’s homeland security facility. Miller , Bondi and Musk have a long record of attacking judges who have ruled against Trump’s executive orders or otherwise impeded the administration’s political agenda. Before resuming office this year, Trump directed his followers against judges presiding over his civil and criminal trials, who were then deluged with threats and harassment . Monitoring groups, law enforcement agencies and judges themselves have pointed to a heightened atmosphere of threats and intimidation in the months since he re-entered the White House. According to data gathered by the US Marshals Service , in 2025 through to the end of September, there were 562 threats to 395 federal judges, giving rise to 805 investigations. 2025 has already eclipsed 2022, the first year of published records, and 2024, and is on track to exceed 2023’s record of 630 threats made. The threats are not just happening at the federal level. Data from Princeton’s Bridging Divides Initiative indicates that there have been at least 59 instances of threats, harassment, stalking, or violence committed against judges on the local level in 2025. Experts say that the threats are a product of the rhetoric coming from senior administration figures. In May, the Global Project Against Hate and Extremism (GPAHE) published a detailed report alleging that “malicious and highly irresponsible statements from Trump administration members and allies coincide with escalating violent posts on social media”. It recorded “a 54% increase in calls for impeachment and violent threats against judges across social media platforms from January to February 2025, the first full month of Trump’s administration”. Heidi Beirich, the co-founder of GPAHE, said: “Trump’s threats against judges have definitely driven online vitriol at judges and calls for impeachment. Targeting the judiciary is one more step in Trump’s march towards authoritarianism.” That march towards authoritarianism has been well-trodden in recent years in several countries, including by Bukele. In 2021, immediately after commencing a second term in the face of constitutional prohibitions , Bukele’s parliamentary loyalists voted to dismiss the country’s attorney general and five justices on the constitutional court . The judges, who had provoked his ire by ruling against coronavirus measures, made way for replacements hand picked by Bukele. The move echoed Viktor Orbán’s remodeling of Hungary’s court system in 2018 ; Recep Tayyip Erdoğan’s judicial purges in 2019 ; and attempts at similar moves in Israel and Poland . Experts say that the threats and rhetorical attacks in the US can be seen as attempts to undermine judicial independence in a system that offers no easy way for the executive to dismiss judges Trump disapproves of. Meghan Leonard, an associate professor at Illinois State University who has researched authoritarian backsliding in democracies, said the Trump administration had learned from the examples set by authoritarians overseas. “The administration is looking around at these successes and failures. They know they’re not going to be able to pass any legislation that would weaken the judiciary,” she said. Pointing to examples such as Miller’s relentless assertions of nearly limitless presidential authority, she added: “They directly attack the judiciary by repeating over and over that it is not a co-equal branch in the separation of powers. “They continue to reframe the debate by repeating their claim that the president has more power than this other co-equal branch, which is not how separation powers work.” Leonard said: “Judges’ only protection is people’s belief in the legitimacy of their ability to make those decisions. Individual threats on top of weakening institutional legitimacy may make judges think twice about decisions that go against the current administration, which is, of course, massively problematic for judicial review and for democracy.” Kim Lane Scheppele, professor of sociology and international affairs at Princeton University, has written about the use of “ autocratic legalism “ by the likes of Orbán and Putin, and has spoken out about escalating threats to judges in the US. She pointed to a wave of so-called “ pizza doxxings “ this year, in which judges have received unsolicited pizza deliveries with the recipient listed as Daniel Anderl, the son of Judge Esther Salas, who was killed at the judge’s home in 2020 by a gunman targeting Salas. “Everyone understands what it means. ‘We know where you live. ‘We’re coming for you,’” Scheppele said. “Federal judges are protected by the Secret Service and the Marshals Service. And those are both specialized police units that sit institutionally inside the Department of Justice. And Pam Bondi has been leading the attacks on federal judges” On the administration’s aims, Scheppele said that “impeaching a federal judge is almost certainly not going to happen because it’s so hard to do. Right now, I don’t think that the desire of the Trump administration is to remove the judges via impeachment. It is to scare the judges enough to get some of them to think twice about ruling against the administration.” She said: “Bukele knows how to play that game. He’s very skilled at it. I’m not surprised that he’s annotating the US crisis and cheering on Trump. He knows that Trump lives online; he’s also currying favor.” Beirich said: “It’s not surprising that someone like Bukele would do this, or Hungary’s Orbán, given their autocratic behavior. But an American president supposedly supportive of democracy should know better.”",https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/12/trump-bukele-judges,World,BBC,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0aed08a05f4e9525b9b5cd5a0a7e081287048f6b/463_0_4608_3689/master/4608.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=7ae009ba6be6acc9ff7b7171cd84ad5e",2025-10-12T12:00:53+00:00,45dffc100601350c8d5cabc5b4908481101c0da9
660e209bae58,The IMF boss is right to say ‘buckle up’ – the global economy is facing multiple menaces,,"L ittle more than 48 hours passed last week between a warning from the IMF chief, Kristalina Georgieva, that “uncertainty is the new normal” and Donald Trump’s latest tariff onslaught – this time aimed at China. Markets plunged on Friday after Trump threatened to levy punitive additional tariffs of 100% on Chinese goods in retaliation for Beijing’s blocks on exports of rare earth minerals. The world’s finance ministers and central bankers will meet in Washington this week for the annual meetings of the IMF and World Bank . In her curtain-raiser speech for the gathering, Georgieva rightly pointed out the global economy has proved more resilient than some feared at the time of the spring meetings in April, when the world’s policymakers were transfixed by the chaos emanating from the White House. Part of the reason for that has been “front loading”: Trump’s intention to jack up tariffs was no secret, and many companies ran up inventories in advance and started to rejig their supply chains. Another explanation is that the US’s trading partners have in general preferred to use a combination of flattery and capitulation in the face of Trump’s approach, rather than causing an all-out trade war. Meanwhile, firms and governments have increasingly been forging new trade connections that bypass the US, creating what Adam Posen, the director of the Washington-based Peterson Institute for International Economics , has called a “new economic geography”. There was evidence of this in the latest update from the UN’s trade and development arm, Unctad, last week. “Trade growth remained positive in the first half of 2025, despite rising trade policy uncertainty, persistent geopolitical tensions and a challenging global economic environment,” Unctad reported. Far from grinding to a halt, global trade expanded by more than $500bn (£375bn) in the first half of the year and was expected to continue growing in the third quarter, with much of the momentum coming from developing countries. Adding to the sense of shifting tectonic plates, Unctad highlighted the continued prevalence of “friendshoring” – the phrase coined by the former Federal Reserve governor Janet Yellen to describe trading with trusted geopolitical allies. The impact of tariffs on the US economy also appears to have been less dramatic than first feared – though with policy continuing to change by the week, the full effects have likely not yet reached American consumers. Yet Friday’s furore was a reminder that, as Georgieva argued, there are still reasons to be fearful – or as she put it: “Global resilience has not yet been fully tested. And there are worrying signs the test may come.” As the new row with China shows, Trump is continuing to wield tariffs as a weapon, creating fresh shocks in financial markets. The impact has been especially tough in developing countries, some of which, as Unctad pointed out, have faced some of the highest tariffs. Away from trade policy, the White House continues to pursue unfunded tax cuts and trash the economic institutions usually considered the cornerstones of credibility – including the Federal Reserve. Over time, that must surely undermine market confidence, including in US Treasuries (government bonds) – an important benchmark against which assets in global markets are valued. There is little sign of that yet; but once lost, economic credibility is hard to rebuild. Part of the reason markets have not responded more skittishly to this and other concerns is that the economic picture is being flattered by another extraordinary and unpredictable phenomenon: the AI boom. skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Business Today Get set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morning Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

A wall of funding continues to pour into the tech industry as investors bet on the future of generative AI and battle to build the massive datacentres required to train and run the models . Data from the World Trade Organization last week showed that a full 20% of the growth in global goods trade in the first half of the year was accounted for by “AI-related goods – including semiconductors, servers, and telecommunications equipment”, much of it flowing from Asia to the US. As Ben May of Oxford Economics said recently: “The surge in US capital spending to develop AI capability has been masking weakness in other parts of the domestic economy.” However, a growing number of observers have begun to fret that generative AI may not deliver the extraordinary gains that would justify Wall Street valuations of the tech companies. And the increasingly complex web of cross-shareholdings between some of the key firms involved has raised eyebrows . The Bank of England last week became the latest body to warn about the risk of a “sudden correction” in global markets if the AI boom goes into reverse. “On a number of measures, equity market valuations appear stretched, particularly for technology companies focused on artificial intelligence. This … leaves equity markets particularly exposed should expectations around the impact of AI become less optimistic,” it said. Georgieva echoed that caution, comparing the AI boom to the dotcom bubble around the turn of the millennium. “Today’s valuations are heading toward levels we saw during the bullishness about the internet 25 years ago,” she warned, raising the spectre of a “sharp correction”. The dollar and dollar-denominated assets remain the lifeblood of much of global finance, despite efforts since the financial crisis to build up the importance of other currencies – so an AI crash would reverberate worldwide. Perhaps it is fitting that Trump has unleashed a new round of destabilising threats just as policymakers fly into town to take the temperature of the world economy. It certainly drove home Georgieva’s central message to them: “Buckle up.”",https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/oct/12/the-imf-boss-is-right-to-say-buckle-up-the-global-economy-is-facing-multiple-menaces,Business,BBC,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b303a4c83ff3c979daada3a3a2b3286728484d1e/497_0_2880_2304/master/2880.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=7c0080b9fdc3b9a7b09ea414229654fc",2025-10-12T09:52:42+00:00,a5733e99eaa6a8fec614098b0a0520d0af2c8ff7
57caa9e21f76,"What is the new EU border system EES, and how will it work?",,"The system means most non-EU citizens will have to register their biometric information at the border. Travellers’ faces will have to be photographed and fingerprints scanned before they are allowed into Europe’s Schengen area. The system will eventually replace passports being stamped by border officials. What is EES? It is not a replacement for passport control. Travellers will still have to go through checks with border officials at ports. But eventually they will not have their passport stamped – instead, countries in the Schengen area will log travellers’ faces, fingerprints, and entry and exit dates. The system is being introduced to make border crossing faster and more efficient, while also tracking who is coming in and out. The EU says it will also give it information that will be used for security purposes. This is the start of a phased introduction of the system. It is scheduled to be fully in place by 10 April 2026. Where does it apply and to whom? The EES applies to the Schengen area, which comprises 25 of the 27 EU member states as well as Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland. It includes countries where British people travel to frequently for holidays such as Spain, France, Portugal, Greece and Italy. The Republic of Ireland and Cyprus are not part of the Schengen area and so will continue to process passports as before. The EES applies to people who are not from an EU country or from Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland – although there are some exceptions such as people who have long-stay visas, among others. How does it work? When someone arrives at the border for the first time after the EES is in place, they will use a self-service screen to register their name, passport details, fingerprints, and the date and place of entry and exit. The machine will photograph their face. Children under 12 will not have their fingerprints scanned. When people first come into contact with the EES depends on where they are travelling to and when. Coach and foot passengers going through the port of Dover will go through a new facility for EES processing from Sunday. From November, this will apply to all traffic. Coach passengers going through the Eurotunnel will also go through the checks from Sunday. The process will be rolled out gradually over the coming months on Eurostar, which has installed registration terminals at its departure areas at St Pancras International in London. For other trips the process will happen when travellers get to the destination country. Airports are implementing the changes at different times. For example, Germany will phase in the service starting with a small airport in Stuttgart and then build up to operations in Frankfurt, one of the busiest aviation hubs in Europe. Will I have to get to Dover earlier? There have been concerns that the extra time it takes to process the EES data will lead to delays. However, the port of Dover has asked coach drivers not to arrive at the port any more than two hours before travel. Eurostar has said that the time it will take for the process can be squeezed into the current 75-minute window passengers are asked to spend at the station before departure. And the chief executive of Eurotunnel, Yann Leriche, has said the company is fully prepared and does not expect lengthy queues. Border officials have been told they have discretion to suspend EES if queues are building. What will happen to the data that is collected? The data provided digitally through the EES will kept for three years, with some exceptions, after which it is erased. It can be used by border, visa and immigration authorities in the countries using the system as well as local police and Europol, the EU agency for law enforcement. The EU says that the information may be transferred to another country, outside Schengen, or an international organisation, such as a UN body, under “strict conditions”. If travellers cross the border again, within the three-year period, the process should be quicker as the face picture and fingerprints will already be on file. If a person refuses to provide a picture or have their fingerprints taken then they will be refused entry , the EU says.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/oct/12/new-eu-new-border-system-ees-delays,Business,BBC,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6e4c60e5dfa5da80d0c21f577ec7ccd958349ad1/253_0_3779_3024/master/3779.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=e979dabbcddd298243909e154dce2302",2025-10-12T04:00:41+00:00,b360ad98945ddf2db9d9e898bd7866f746614e2b
5b7e73487506,Urgent calls for debt relief as study shows health and education cuts in developing world,,"Top economists are demanding urgent action on debt relief in Washington this week, as analysis from the campaign group Debt Justice shows struggling governments are cutting back on health and education. As finance ministers and central bankers gather for the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and World Bank annual meetings, influential experts including the Nobel laureate Joseph Stiglitz, and leading economists Mariana Mazzucato and Jayati Ghosh, are urging them to “turn debt into hope”. They are calling for the urgent replenishment of the IMF and World Bank’s debt relief funds, and changes to the way the institutions work, to ensure more countries can receive debt cancellation . “Bold action on debt means more children in classrooms, more nurses in hospitals, more action on climate change, more jobs, more trade, and less need for aid,” they say in a letter to global policymakers published on Sunday . The signatories, who have been involved in producing important recent reports on debt relief, including for the UN secretary general and the pope , said African governments spend an average of 17% of their revenues on servicing debts. “A cap of 10% in 21 countries could unlock enough money to provide clean water and sanitation to roughly 10 million people, as well as avert roughly 23,000 under-5 deaths each year,” they argue. Other signatories to the letter include the former South African finance minister Trevor Manuel, and former Italian prime minister Paulo Gentiloni. Analysis by the UK-based Debt Justice shows declining health and education spending in countries whose debts the IMF considers to be “sustainable”. Debt Justice looked at a group of 11 countries, including Sierra Leone, Mozambique, Kenya and Pakistan, which have long-term IMF programmes, and where the Washington-based lender classifies them as at risk of not being able to repay – but that do not qualify for debt relief. The research finds that over the course of their IMF programmes, health spending per person in this group of countries has been cut by 18% on average in real terms with education spending reduced by 10%. Heidi Chow, the executive director of Debt Justice, said: “By denying debt relief for countries that need it, the IMF is acting as a debt collector for rich and powerful creditors, while harming millions of people in debtor countries. Forcing countries to pay debts in full is leading to deepening crises in health, education and vital public services.” skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Business Today Get set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morning Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The G20 group of economies, now chaired by South Africa, had been expected to make debt relief and inequality a focus, but with the final summit in Johannesburg in November, campaigners complain there has been little concrete progress. In 2026, the G20 chair will pass to Donald Trump.

5efcbe2ba148,‘Using us as political pawns’: federal workers reel over threats of firings and withheld back pay,,"W ith no end of the federal government shutdown in sight, an estimated 750,000 workers remain furloughed. Hundreds of thousands more are working without pay. They are being “held hostage by a political dispute”, according to union leaders, as Republicans and Democrats remain deadlocked. In the Oval Office on Tuesday, Donald Trump suggested that furloughed employees would not necessarily receive back pay – despite a legal guarantee – prompting further unease throughout the federal workforce. “There are some people that don’t deserve to be taken care of, and we’ll take care of them in a different way,” the US president said. The administration, meanwhile, continues to threaten mass firings if Democrats stand by their demands. “If this keeps going on, it’ll be substantial,” Trump told reporters. “And a lot of those jobs will never come back.” On Friday, Russell Vought, the White House office of management and budget (OMB) director, announced on social media that layoffs had begun. Several federal agencies started announcing layoffs , but details remained scant on how many workers would be impacted. After a brutal year for the federal workforce , employees who spoke to the Guardian expressed growing anxiety over their pay – and the future of their jobs. “This is the third time I’ve been furloughed in my federal career,” said Priscilla Novak, a furloughed federal employee researcher. “But this is the first time there were threats of having people be fired en masse. I’ve been checking my email every day to see if I’m fired yet.” “Even before the shutdown, it’s just kind of been one thing after another for us,” said Peter Farruggia, a furloughed employee at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). “I think a lot of us are expecting the worst, hoping for the best.” “Not knowing when my next paycheck is going to get here is definitely very daunting,” Farruggia, also executive committee chair of AFGE Local 2883, which represents CDC workers, added. “But at least I paid rent this month, so that was probably the most important thing. If some of my other bills go by the wayside, then it is what it is, and I don’t really have any other options to seek out.” “What I’m hearing is a lot of anxiety, confusion, and chaos,” said Brent Barron, a US Department of Labor employee who serves as president of the National Council of Field Labor Locals, which represents workers at the department outside Washington DC. Some staffers don’t even know whether they’re furloughed or not, he claimed, let alone “whether or not they’re going to continue to have a job” for much longer. “There are a lot of employees out there that can’t even miss one check, let alone have this thing drag on for weeks and weeks and weeks,” said Barron. About three-quarters of the labor department has been furloughed. “All we want to do is do our jobs.” A law signed by Trump during his first term, the Government Employee Fair Treatment Act, guarantees all federal workers receive retroactive back pay once a government shutdown is over. “It really baffles me that this administration can just flaunt whatever law and say they don’t have to follow it,” said Barron. “This is a law that was passed in 2019 by Congress and signed by the president. And we all know who was president in 2019.” Trump officials are now facing calls to clarify that the federal government will follow the law, and ensure that every furloughed employee receives back pay. “Given the clarity of the law, there is no place for the Administration to backpedal on its obligation to pay furloughed workers,” labor unions and Democracy Defenders Fund, a watchdog group, wrote to the OMB on Wednesday. “The Administration’s statements appear to be a naked attempt at inflicting pain on innocent parties to gain advantage in the shutdown.” OMB is led by Vought, an architect of the rightwing Project 2025 blueprint. In a private speech in 2023 , Vought spoke of wanting to put officials “through trauma” to reduce the capacity of the federal government. “When they wake up in the morning, we want them to not want to go to work.” As the administration continues to threaten mass layoffs, raising the prospect of further cuts beyond the 300,000 federal employees set to be removed from the government by the end of this year through firings and attrition programs , officials have also been ordered by a federal judge to provide specifics on the status of any layoff plans, the agencies affected, and whether any federal employees have been recalled to work to carry out reductions in force. “The American people and the workers who keep this country running are being held hostage by a political dispute, by a petty political dispute that they have nothing to do with,” Greg Regan, president of the AFL-CIO’s transportation trades department, said during a press conference this week. “This is entirely vindictive and the only victims are going to be this country. “We’ve all seen the reports every single time we go through this stupid process of a shutdown, how much the American taxpayers lost. It’s a drain on our economy. It’s a drain on our safety. It’s a drain on the people that live here. So we need to put this to an end.” ‘People cannot focus on their jobs’ Almost all Transportation Security Administration (TSA) employees are required to work without pay during shutdowns, in a bid to minimize the threat of disruptions at key travel hubs like airports. The uncertainty has been particularly unnerving for newer, lower-paid employees, according to Cameron Cochems, a lead TSA officer and vice-president for AFGE Local 1127, which represents the administration’s employees in Idaho. Workers are worried about when they start missing paychecks, he said, adding that several have asked where to get low interest loans to float them through missed paychecks. “It feels kind of like there’s just a train coming and you can hear the whistle blowing, but every day it gets a little closer and closer to us,” Cochems told the Guardian. “And right now we can barely hear the whistle because we’re still focused on our jobs, we’re still focused on the mission, which is protect the nation’s transportation system to ensure freedom of movement for people in commerce. “But once that paycheck doesn’t come, I think that that train whistle is going to get louder in everyone’s heads, and it could get so loud that people cannot focus on their job because they’re focusing on things like ‘The bank is calling me for the fifth time today’, or ‘I don’t know how to pay for my daycare,’ things like that.” Threats made about federal workers not being entitled to back pay by Trump and his top officials have heightened anxieties and fears and “thrown a lot more people for a loop, especially the people that are disadvantaged, single parents or living paycheck to paycheck”, added Cochems. “It just feels like they’re intentionally using us as political pawns, and they intentionally want to make our jobs and lives unstable,” he said. “Even worse than morale is the future implication for how our government runs,” added Novak. “I think having a strong civil service that is not politically motivated is the most effective to render modern services for our citizens. Furloughed workers want to go back to work. We need Congress to pass a budget.” The White House and office of management and budget did not respond to multiple requests for comment.",https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/12/federal-workers-firings-threats,Business,BBC,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/842f57837fcc633d1af29adfa994f25614879363/869_0_4585_3667/master/4585.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=5ef0f542e1763b90d699e19685886099",2025-10-12T10:00:49+00:00,1d2cbae8273baf8ff43c1dc9c86019bcbf69ecbd
d874906e57d3,‘London has turned into something crazy’: is the city in the grip of a crime wave?,,"London is no longer a safe place to live, at least in the eyes of some of its richest residents – and the 47th president of the United States. “I think he’s done a terrible job,” Donald Trump said during his state visit to the UK last month, in his latest broadside at London’s mayor, Sadiq Khan. “Crime in London is through the roof.” Trump’s view is increasingly accepted wisdom in rightwing circles and is gaining traction more widely . Crime is even being blamed – along with rising taxes – for an apparent exodus of the super-rich from the UK. A prime property agent recalls a client’s Rolex being stolen off his wrist the first night he moved into Kensington, the west London neighbourhood that is one of the city’s most affluent. Advisers to the super-rich describe a city where “spotters” linger outside exclusive restaurants sizing up possible targets, while demand for private bodyguards grows. It is a view that Reform UK’s leader, Nigel Farage, often repeats, warning one journalist : “I dare you to walk through the West End of London after 9 o’clock of an evening wearing jewellery. You wouldn’t do it. You know that I’m right. You wouldn’t do it.” A series of high-profile crimes has helped reinforce that view. The ex-Formula One driver Jenson Button and his wife, Brittny, had a suitcase containing £250,000 worth of valuables snatched within moments of their arrival at King’s Cross St Pancras. In January, the socialite Shafira Huang’s mansion in Primrose Hill, north London, was burgled, with thieves taking more than £10m worth of bespoke jewellery. In November, the owners of the Sellier luxury goods store in Knightsbridge shared footage of masked men ransacking their premises, later commenting: “London has just turned into something crazy.” But is crime in the capital really “through the roof”? While statistics show crime is falling across England and Wales, with violent crime dropping dramatically over the past two decades , crime in London is up. Recorded crime has increased by 31% in the past decade in the area that the Metropolitan police covers, with violent crime up by 40%. Mobile phone theft remains a menace in London, with one ebike-riding thief jailed last year for stealing 24 phones in an hour. But there are signs that the tide is starting to turn in the capital, with violent crime falling by 6% in the year to the end of March, according to the Met police. Luxury watch theft, once a stain on London’s elite neighbourhoods of Mayfair and Knightsbridge, has massively reduced in the past two years. So why does perception not match reality? Is violent crime falling? Many crimes go unreported to the police, so the Crime Survey for England and Wales asks tens of thousands of households directly every year whether they have been the victim of a crime. The findings suggest crime has fallen dramatically over the past 20 years. Crime survey chart Last year London reported the lowest number of homicides of under-25s for more than two decades. Overall, murders are at a five-year low, and the rate is much lower than in other international cities such as New York, Paris, Brussels, Berlin and Madrid, according to analysis by Khan’s office. But knife crime has been rising in London: while the number of recorded knife crimes fell from 2012 in the run-up to 2016, it then started to rise again, hitting a peak of 15,600 incidents in 2019. There was a sharp drop during the pandemic, but it has since been closing in on its previous peak, standing at 15,000 in 2023-24. More recent statistics show knife crime in London dropping by 19% in the three months to June, compared with a year earlier. Other serious offences are dropping: in the year ending in March, there was a 6% reduction in violent crime overall, according to the Met police. And in a city that is home to about 9 million people, Londoners are less likely (26.4 offences per 1,000 people) to be a victim of violent crime than people across the rest of England and Wales (31.9 offences per 1,000 people), according to figures from the mayor’s office. So why is it that the narrative of a lawless capital is so prevalent? A YouGov survey in September showed 51% of adults thought violent crime in London was increasing, against just 7% who thought it was falling. The “broken windows” idea partly explains why: this is the criminology theory that visible signs of minor crime and antisocial behaviour create an environment that encourages further crime, and normalises disorder as a part of public life. A CCTV camera captures the moment when thieves on a moped snatch a phone in London. Photograph: Metropolitan police/PA Take phone theft, for example. After dropping during the pandemic, phone theft has been steadily rising since 2020, when there were 55,820 incidents reported to the Met. The figure has more than doubled, standing at 117,211 last year. These snatch thefts can cause huge distress and financial impact to victims, given the vast amount of personal data stored on phones and mobile banking apps. They are also harder to police, with criminals using ebikes and mopeds to make rapid getaways, and links to organised gangs that have sophisticated and established supply chains to sell phones abroad . It means that in areas such as Knightsbridge, which was hit particularly hard by watch thefts in 2022, it gave residents a broader sense of lawlessness in the UK. But some of these numbers suggest police are starting to get a grip. Reports of phone theft fell by 28% to 213 in the City of London, which has its own police force, in the first four months of 2025, compared with the same period in the year prior. Outside the capital’s financial district, phone theft is still rising, but luxury watch, handbag and jewellery theft are all down in London, according to figures obtained from the Met police under a freedom of information request. There were 783 counts of stolen watches that were worth at least £3,000 in 2024, compared with 2,054 the year prior, according to the Met’s data. Counts of stolen handbags worth at least £1,000 fell from 2,324 in 2023 to 721 last year. Counts of stolen jewellery, excluding watches, worth at least £1,000 fell from 4,977 to 1,863. The sharp drop coincides with a big crackdown by the Met, with plainclothes officers baiting thieves in crime hotspots after dark. This summer three men were jailed after a Met police investigation into a series of high-value watch robberies in central London. Detectives used CCTV to identify a group of violent repeat offenders, who carried out two robberies in Mayfair on consecutive days. Theft of watches graphic Despite the big drop, the perception of danger still remains among many of the super-rich, especially when it comes to their watches. A store manager in Mayfair said that while he made his living by selling luxury watches, he now told his clients not to wear them on the street. Luxury goods thefts graphic Reputations: hard-won, easily lost The capital’s Berkeley Square, which is bordered by A-list hotspots such as Sexy Fish restaurant and Annabel’s members club, has become a hotspot for late-night watch crime, according to the Watch Register, which works and shares data with the police. The timepieces, which are easier to transport than drugs or cash, have now become an “underworld currency”, the company said. About 20% of watches that it finds are in a different country from where they were stolen. “Luxury watches have become a preferred form of criminal currency due to their high portability across borders, which makes them easier to move than drugs or cash,” said Julian Radcliffe, founder of the Watch Register. “They are small, portable, innocuous items which are only identifiable by serial number.” Not wearing a luxury watch outside is now the standard advice, says Matthew Beer, a director at the security firm King Safety and Security. “There has been a longstanding issue around opportunistic street crime,” he said. “That slowed a little bit with the Met’s response with more tactical interventions but we are still seeing a lot of electric bike-enabled phone theft and watch theft with an unpredictable level of violence associated with that.” It means that for ultra-high net worth clients, there is a greater appetite for “close protection” services – in other words, bodyguards. “Those who would have had protection in the past have a greater appetite for more security,” Beer said. “So where we once had a security driver and one close protection officer, we are now pushing that out so family members also receive protection.” Crimes graphic The numbers suggest demand for security is growing: in 2024, there were 4,650 applications for a close protection licence from the Security Industry Authority, a 33% rise compared with the year before. Last year the regulator awarded 187,113 qualifications across the industry, an increase of 5%, which includes services such as the transport of cash and valuables, door supervision and security guarding. “More established travellers, perhaps someone who comes from an environment that is historically more dangerous, they would still view London as a relatively safe place to be,” Beer added. “Younger clients who are more engaged on social media; their understanding of it is perhaps a little clearer. You don’t need to be ultra-high net worth individual to be a target: [you are] if you have a reasonably nice watch or carrying a designer handbag.” Stephen Helliwell, of the security consultants Aldermans, said: “I think the police are under strain as [political] protests continue; that is a lot of distraction. But it is during times of economic stress that is when people are motivated to turn to crime.” Even so, it has not been enough to drive off the super-rich, he said. “Some of the high net worth clients we have got like football stars, they will just strengthen the preventions that they have got. They still want to reside in London because it is a great city.” A spokesperson for the Met police said: “Tackling violent crime in all of its forms is one of the Met’s priorities and we have reduced the number of personal robberies across London by 12% since April. “Uniform and plainclothed officers proactively patrol robbery hotspots to identify offences taking place, but more importantly to help prevent and deter offenders from committing them in the first place.”",https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/oct/11/is-london-in-the-grip-of-a-wave-its-not-so-simple,Business,BBC,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/46bd98640d5057dd9cad689a49c95e2d059f2f78/337_0_3365_2692/master/3365.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=54893cf2a2f94650ef978bc90b5aa14d",2025-10-11T10:00:20+00:00,7d4b71ba3e5d21f2f1ccfe8a15f2ff60fb94e544
4619e9fbe9e1,"AI tools churn out ‘workslop’ for many US employees, but ‘the buck’ should stop with the boss",,"Artificial intelligence sure has been taking a lot of flak lately. Only 8.5% of the 48,000 people recently surveyed by accounting firm KPMG said that they “always” trust AI search results. Another report from Gartner found that more than half of consumers don’t trust AI searches, with most reporting “significant” mistakes. A McKinsey study found that 80% of companies using generative AI have seen “no significant bottom-line impact”, with 42% of them literally abandoning their AI projects. An MIT study found that 95% of the AI pilot projects at the big companies they surveyed “failed”. And now there’s workslop! A new study published in the Harvard Business Review says that more than 40% of US-based full-time employees reported receiving AI-generated content that “masquerades as good work but lacks the substance to meaningfully advance a given task”. This “workslop” is “destroying productivity”, according to the study’s researchers. Who is really to blame for workslop? Sure, blame big tech companies for yet again releasing untested and unproven products before they’re ready for prime time. Or the media and tech community who, for the past three years, have been writing pieces like Yahoo Japan wants all its 11,000 employees to use Gen AI to double their productivity by 2028 or AI will replace doctors, teachers, and make humans “unnecessary for most things” . All of this creates a lot of unnecessary hype and unfounded expectations. But in the workplace, the buck always stops with the boss. The responsibility for AI’s “workslop” lies fully at the feet of the employer. For more than 20 years, my company has implemented customer relationship and financial management applications at hundreds of small and mid-sized businesses across the country. We’ve worked with thousands of employees. We’ve had good projects and straight-out failures. As a technology consultant, we’ve made our share of mistakes. But the most common root cause of technology disappointments, failures and letdowns can always be found with the people who are buying and implementing the product. So before throwing shade at software companies rolling out AI, I think it’s fair to ask employers a few questions. For example, did you invest in training for your employees? Do your employees truly understand how to create the right prompts in order to get the best answers? Has your company standardized on an AI assistant or is it just a free-for-all mess of apps? Do you have an AI policy that formalizes what AI can and cannot be used for and who can and cannot use it? Do you have a designated person in your company who is responsible for your AI-based applications? Has this person been trained and provided technical support to do this job? Are you working with a competent partner, consultant or developer to provide these kinds of services? Most importantly, do you actually have a plan for using this technology effectively or are you just leaving it up to your employees to figure it all out? Do you have specific metrics for measuring AI’s effectiveness, or are you just relying on vague assumptions of “productivity”? Unfortunately, many employers are duped by big tech into thinking that they just press a button and their software starts doing magical things that spew out money for their business. But, in order not to scare people away, these same tech companies don’t warn their customers of all the other things that need to happen – and money that needs to be spent – in order to maximize the use of their product. In most cases, the software is not the problem. It’s the lack of investment in the people using it. AI can be a powerful tool if deployed the right way and with the right expectations. But in the end it’s just that: a tool. And new tools require thought, training, processes and investment. In the end, AI doesn’t produce “workslop”. Employers do.",https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/oct/12/ai-workslop-us-employees,Business,BBC,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e9d7b3b9f0829488a55b6fc6e31d912285d0fe88/533_0_6185_4946/master/6185.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=ecad1667d80eccce4eac5759c99c6331",2025-10-12T14:00:55+00:00,3dc7bf0500ebf29c9b0d757cf2479ca388fd0917
8ccfb3b1fbdc,I spent years trying to avoid Vinted. It turns out I was right to be afraid,,"I downloaded Vinted for the first time this year. I’m incredibly late to the party, since the app has more than 16 million UK users and launched here in 2014. My not-so-conscientious objection was rooted in a hatred of secondhand clothes. My inner (teenaged) self said I’d worked my way to being able to afford nice (ie new) things, and I didn’t want my wardrobe to look like I’d raided a jumble sale. Shopping secondhand would make me feel poor again. Two things changed. Every other time I asked a well-dressed friend where her jumper, bag or trainers were from, she would say Vinted. Then, as I emptied my wardrobe from the storage unit it had been living in for a year, I was greeted by my secret shame: two unworn shirts from a cult (ie expensive) brand that I bought years ago and missed the window to return. I got the app, snapped a few pics of the shirts and wrote what I considered to be an enticing sales pitch. I sold my first shirt on the same day and received a five-star review from my buyer. I was an ethical entrepreneur! I was saving the planet! I was spreading joy and getting paid! Riding a dopamine high of “free” money, I listed more clothes and waited for the cash to roll in. To my utter dismay, my extremely fashionable, hardly worn clothes were no longer flying off the shelf. A friend explained I had probably priced the shirts too cheaply and my other clothes too high. The app’s pricing algorithm agreed. Still, it felt like a personal rejection, like the internet was saying I had bad taste. It’s not just selling that gives you a dopamine hit. The app can generate endless pings and updates to keep you engaged. I have notifications turned off on my phone, but I got 21 emails from Vinted the first week I started using it. You get told when someone “likes” an item you’ve listed (a way of saving something they might buy later). Meanwhile, as a buyer, if you like an item, the seller often slides into your inbox offering it at a discounted price. I found this very stressful at first, like the digital equivalent of making eye contact with a slightly desperate salesperson. Fast fashion rightly gets a bad rap but Vinted’s platform was built using the same digital tricks that keep us scrolling on Instagram or TikTok. There’s an algorithm that predicts what you want, gamification and variable rewards that keep you hooked. Six months in, it’s easily one of the most used apps on my phone. My smug sense that I was participating in the circular economy was undermined when I told a climate-conscious friend how cheap secondhand books are on Vinted (I don’t understand how anyone is making money selling them). She pointed out there’s a pretty big environmental cost to shipping books around the country, and that perhaps my local library was a more sustainable option. And that’s before you factor in the pay and conditions for delivery drivers at most of the big delivery companies. Not only have I lost hours scrolling, Vinted has also made me petty. As I switched from selling to buying, I learned how small-scale haggling is built into the platform. Vinted automatically calculates a 5% or 10% discount on something you like so you can offer less than it’s listed for. I spent an entire month “negotiating” the price down on a summer dress. In the end we were haggling over less than a pound and when it arrived I got three wears out of it before it became too cold. I punched the air when I got £2 off a slightly worn winter coat. It turned up with a tear in the lining that wasn’t in the listing. I felt simultaneously outraged and delighted – surely I could squeeze some more money off from the seller? She called my bluff and suggested I post it back so she could sell it to someone else. Pay for postage twice? Over my dead body. Vinted has saved me money and brought me joy. But I’ve definitely spent more than I earned from those shirts. It’s probably time to take a break, but if you’re interested in a hot pink wool coat from Cos (good condition) I’m still open to offers.

280bbff4ebfb,The Guardian view on an AI bubble: capitalism still hasn’t evolved to protect itself,,"T he message from global regulators this week was blunt: the AI boom is driving stocks to dotcom-bubble highs – and the world is finally listening. With so much cash riding on so few firms, any loss of faith could send shares tumbling and drag down the wider economy. China’s proposed export controls on rare earths add a fresh threat: not just to sentiment, but to advanced chip supply chains themselves. It’s a long way down from such dizzying heights if gravity reasserts itself. Warnings from the past abound in Charles Kindleberger’s history of financial crises, Manias, Panics and Crashes , which begins with tulip mania in 1636. What commonly happens, he wrote, is “that some event changes the economic outlook. New opportunities for profits are seized, and overdone.” Once the mistake is realised, there’s a panicked exit with a crash in the price of “whatever has been the subject of the mania”. The pattern repeats itself so frequently that it seems investors never learn and central bankers learn too late. But why? Look to economist Hyman Minsky, from whom Kindleberger borrowed much. Minsky addressed the deeper conundrum that is being sidestepped today: how to stabilise financial innovations before they destabilise the system? He thought that the longer markets remain calm, the more risk they take. The genius – and danger – of capitalism is that it can’t stop chasing another win. To prevent that, Minsky thought, required not moral restraint but institutional redesign. Minsky’s insight into capitalism was that it runs on belief. Firms invest today because they expect others to invest tomorrow, while lenders need high asset prices – and move to shore them up. This confidence loop keeps the economy humming until doubt creeps in, valuations slip and an inevitable and abrupt market crash looms. To avert this needed radical change. His plan advocated a “big government” not to prop up share prices, but to prop up society when share prices fall. Backing this was a “big bank”, a monetary authority that would make it harder to buy risky assets on credit. Minsky thought cash should be guided toward productive uses, not asset inflation. He didn’t want to stifle innovation but to make it safe for democracy. It’s a warning worth hearing today. This summer, OpenAI’s Sam Altman called some tech valuations “ insane ”. Amazon’s Jeff Bezos says we’re in a bubble . The AI boom looks alarmingly like Minsky’s Ponzi endgame – with prices sustained purely by expectations of rising valuations and easy refinancing. Startups with no product raise billions;  index funds become dominated by juiced up stocks; capital chases fads rather than earnings. The ratio of the total market cap of all US stocks to US GDP is at a record high. Sceptics , however, point out in the year before the dotcom crash the Nasdaq rose 86%, while it has only gone up 24% in the last 12 months. AI may change the world. But perhaps not, if markets can’t deal with the wave of speculation it has unleashed. A Minskyan approach would couple borrowing limits with fiscal and industrial policies that steer cash toward socially useful tech. Mr Altman warned that AI startups with “three people and an idea” are raising vast sums, adding “that’s not rational behaviour. Someone’s gonna get burned.” He’s right. The point isn’t to scold risk-takers, but to build capitalism that can handle – and survive – their excesses.",https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/oct/10/the-guardian-view-on-an-ai-bubble-capitalism-still-hasnt-evolved-to-protect-itself,Business,BBC,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d5e10d9b752b28147ba028247b227c60a533c118/11_0_3219_2576/master/3219.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=3844df74412156090f93fbafbc4d51e7",2025-10-10T17:00:11+00:00,46dccac20c9f32fcad34825b9643a2f2f004bce7
364a95a20933,"It’s Sam Altman: the man who stole the rights from copyright. If he’s the future, can we go backwards?",,"T ake a look at Sam Altman. I mean, actually do it. Go to Google images, where you can find countless photos of the OpenAI boss smiling in a kind of wan genius way, the humble lost puppy of Silicon Valley . But I urge you to simply cover the bottom half of his face in any of these pictures, and you will immediately clock that Sam has the sad-psycho eyes of the lost woman’s boyfriend who the police have asked to front the missing person’s appeal. Please come home, Sheila – we’re all worried sick and we just want you back. If that joke seems off-colour, or crass, or some kind of manipulative stretch – please, don’t worry. I’m using the OpenAI gold standard of giving-a-toss, where the unwilling subjects of any generated content have to formally, time-consumingly and bureaucratically opt out of being used/abused/exploited any way anyone likes. I haven’t heard from Sam, so my assumption is that he’s fine with me saying that he knows exactly where Sheila is because he put her there. He is, after all, fast emerging as precisely the type to appear alongside the phrase “in plain sight”. The past fortnight for Sam has involved the release of AI video generator Sora 2 – a staggering upgrade on the Sora of barely 10 months ago – and its instant descent into a sludge of stolen copyrighted goods. We also saw the announcement of a further web of circular bargains between OpenAI and chip firms like Nvidia and AMD that brings OpenAI’s frenzied deal tally to over $1tn this year alone. That absolutely does not mean that in addition to enabling you to watch videos of meticulously created characters get pixel-puppeted by aggressively bigoted and talentless losers, OpenAI will also enable you to lose your home in a financial crash if the bubble bursts badly. And look, no offence to Sora’s “creators”. I often walk through art galleries and realise the stuff on the walls would be so much better if I simply stole it and drew hilarious penises on it or whatever, and that they wouldn’t have made it publicly viewable if they didn’t want that. Furthermore, no tech titans have a cultural life, so they can’t possibly imagine what could be so creatively valuable you wouldn’t want a robot to desecrate it for cash. If you’ve seen Sam’s frequent reading recommendations, you’ll know they’re literally the “business philosophy” section of a second-tier airport bookshop. Mainly this week, he wanted us to know Sora 2 was all cool and fun. “It is way less strange to watch a feed full of memes of yourself than I thought it would be,” Sam posted reassuringly . So everything’s fine! Although, I guess it helps if you’re one of the most powerful people in the world and making untold billions off this stuff, not just getting revenge-porned in a Byzantium simulation because somehow historical prompts seem to confuse the “guardrails”. I’ve seen it said that OpenAI’s motto should be “better to beg forgiveness than ask permission”, but that cosies it preposterously. Its actual motto seems to be “we’ll do what we want and you’ll let us, bitch”. Consider Altman’s recent political journey. “To anyone familiar with the history of Germany in the 1930s,” Sam warned in 2016 , “it’s chilling to watch Trump in action.” He seems to have got over this in time to attend Donald Trump’s second inauguration , presumably because – if we have to extend his artless and predictable analogy – he’s now one of the industrialists welcome in the chancellery to carve up the spoils. “Thank you for being such a pro-business, pro-innovation president,” Sam simpered to Trump at a recent White House dinner for tech titans. “It’s a very refreshing change.” Inevitably, the Trump administration has refused to bring forward any AI regulation at all. Meanwhile, please remember something Sam and his ironicidal maniacs said earlier this year, when it was suggested that the Chinese AI chatbot DeepSeek might have been trained on some of OpenAI’s work . “We are aware of and reviewing indications that DeepSeek may have inappropriately distilled our models, and will share information as we know more,” his firm’s anguished statement ran. “We take aggressive, proactive countermeasures to protect our technology.” Hilariously, it seemed that the last entity on earth with the power to fight AI theft was OpenAI. It was left to Hollywood talent agencies this week to extract some kind of momentary pause from Altman, who posted some flannel about trying to direct, if not hard cash, then certainly some “new kind of engagement” at those he openly called “rightsholders”. Many of us remember a time – about 15 minutes ago – when rightsholders meant the people who hold the rights . I mean, the clue’s right there in the word. But Sam is post-rights. The question is: if he’s post creative rights, can we honestly believe he isn’t effectively post other kinds of rights? OpenAI wants what all loving platforms ultimately want: its users never to have to leave its confines. It’s clearly positioning towards being seen as the new default homepage of the web, as Meta once did.

3521bfeea732,The Guardian view on AC Milan playing a ‘home’ game in Perth: the clue should be in the name,,"F ootball clubs are community assets, possessing a value, history and meaning which cannot be captured on a balance sheet. They belong to the cities and towns that have sustained them over the decades. For the vast majority of supporters, the sense of identity and matchgoing rituals associated with following their team are worth as much as the occasional trophy or glorious victory. That culture becomes harder to maintain, however, if your club’s next game is taking place 5,000 miles away. European football’s governing body, Uefa, this week announced that it will allow a Spanish league fixture between Villarreal and Barcelona to take place closer to Cuba than Catalonia, in Miami’s Hard Rock stadium. This will be followed, in February, by the relocation to Australia of an Italian Serie A match between Milan and Como. Global sports promoters, rubbing their hands at the potential profits this precedent could unlock, are cockahoop. Supporters organisations in Spain and Italy are considerably less impressed . It is not hard to see why. The clue as to where Milan should play home fixtures is in the name. And at a purely sporting level, regularly playing games on the other side of the world would undermine the fairness of leagues based on an equal distribution of home advantage. While fans outside Europe may get to see their heroes play in meaningful contests this way, the money spent staging them would be far better invested in boosting domestic competitions such as the US’s Major League Soccer. Sadly, in an age when the hyper-monetisation of elite football is already far advanced, a Serie A game in Perth looks like the thin end of a very large wedge of cash. Uefa’s reluctant permission follows the out-of-court settlement of a lawsuit brought by a US sports promoter, which argued that restrictions on where teams play their matches were illegal. For European clubs desperate to compete with the financial heft of English Premier League rivals, the riches promised by freer access to global markets add up to a tempting invitation to sell their soul. As football’s profit-hungry overlords seek ever more creative ways to turn a quick buck, the traditional supporter is the last person on their minds. Spain and Italy have already sold their annual Super Cup games to sportswashing Saudi Arabia, while the cost of tickets for the 2026 World Cup is likely to soar thanks to the use of dynamic ticket pricing . In Britain, the number of one-off visitors paying hospitality-type prices is booming at elite matches, as younger and less well-off fans are priced out. A line must be drawn. Treasured local institutions should not be shunted around the globe in search of the highest bidder. Though it once toyed with the notion of an extra round of matches to be played outside England, the Premier League has thankfully distanced itself from the idea for now. Uefa executives, having been blindsided by the latest developments, have vowed to ensure that rules are updated in order to “uphold the integrity of domestic competitions, and the close bond between clubs, their supporters and local communities”. Longsuffering supporters must hold them to their word. The challenge of “playing away” is an integral part of football. But it should never be necessary to book an intercontinental flight to attend a domestic league fixture.",https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/oct/10/the-guardian-view-on-ac-milan-playing-a-home-game-in-perth-the-clue-should-be-in-the-name,Business,BBC,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/15b5eeb8669133cea3bdb73fad2b672938a704fb/434_0_3445_2756/master/3445.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=65b45a2935047a58f1da61e8e31f5d3b",2025-10-10T16:59:18+00:00,d5498413d3588e115ac0ccd765c83842ea60afcd
7a60f3be2226,Do we need Imax? 70mm? VistaVision? All I need to watch movies at the cinema is darkness and quiet,,"O n what sort of screen should you watch One Battle After Another ? Paul Thomas Anderson’s new film about revolutionary radicals in a ravaged United States comes in a plethora of slightly different, vaguely confusing formats. It was originally shot in ultra-rare, 70-year-old VistaVision celluloid, but there are only four cinemas in the entire world that can actually accommodate this – one in London, three in the US . There is also an Imax version on 70mm celluloid film, the more common digital Imax format, and a 70mm film projection for some select cinemas. And, finally, there are the majority of current cinemas with more standard digital projection, which also happen to have quite big screens for you to gaze up at moving pictures in the dark. With attendances falling and cinemas under threat, I understand why there has been a push to make seeing films more of an event in recent years. Since the pandemic, Tom Cruise has put himself front and centre of a campaign to encourage people into the cinema. Christopher Nolan has also made several of his films with the grand Imax screens in mind: his upcoming The Odyssey is said to be the first blockbuster made entirely with Imax cameras (screenings for the film in the highest-grade format sold out a year in advance ). “Between the vision-filling screen and sound that chases you around the auditorium, it’s more like stepping into the movie than watching it at a safe distance,” purred the Odeon website for its Imax screenings of Mission: Impossible – The Final Reckoning. There is a clear desire to put the emphasis on an all-encompassing feast for the senses; inevitably, the cost of these special screenings is usually higher than a traditional cinema ticket. I love going to the cinema and I try to see new films this way as much as is feasible. But I do think that the focus on seeing things in the cinema now is becoming over-egged – especially when it is given some sort of moral imperative, or if an idea forms that a certain premium version is the “true” experience. Cinema used to be a relatively accessible and affordable mass pursuit. Any move away from this, while potentially bringing short-term gain, may be a mistake in the long run. The fear lingers that by foregrounding limited and premium offerings – akin to going to the opera or a West End theatre – lesser cinemas could be further diminished, and audiences discouraged if a certain format isn’t available or is simply too expensive. Anecdotal evidence from true believers (in the right locations) suggests that seeing One Battle After Another in VistaVision provides the greatest pleasure: the colours are more beautiful, the look and feel is purer, like seeing a painting in person rather than a reproduction in a book. Other cineastes (or Letterboxd bros , per modern nomenclature) say that it must be seen in Imax formats for the true thrill-ride. I personally find viewing at an Imax a little like you’re watching tennis – moving your head this way and that to follow where you should be looking, and the emphasis on immersive viewing a little too literal. A friend suggests that unless you have the perfect seat near the centre of an Imax room, the experience is actually inferior. What is it that we love about seeing a film in the cinema? I don’t think it can be defined by the dimensions of the screen alone. It’s being in a dark room, free from distractions, with a reasonably comfortable seat, surrounded by others, watching the film on a big – or big enough – screen above: sometimes it’s in a vast theatre, sometimes it’s a room for 20 people. All have their merits. And as the host of one US film podcast suggested when asked what was the best place to see One Battle After Another: “In the movie theatre you like the most.” In the end, I saw the film on an “XL” screen at my nearest multiplex: I can’t quite figure out if that meant a bigger screen, bigger seats, or bigger buckets of popcorn. I’ll admit the thrilling visual aspects must hit well on an even more souped-up screen, but they were pretty great from my vantage point, too. As were its kinetic energy and frantic score, dragging you through a story both compellingly strange and laugh-out-loud funny. Granted, there are also valid criticisms to be made. One of my formative moments engaging with “serious” film was when I was aged about 14 and saw Rear Window. It made me instantly realise there could be more to a film than most of what I had seen up to that point. The fact that I happened to watch it on an early-1990s, medium-sized cathode-ray TV one bored Saturday afternoon, almost by accident, didn’t diminish the effect. A love for film can blossom in many formats. Under the right conditions, everything is cinema. skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Matters of Opinion Guardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and more Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

7b5ecad59fb0,First Brands: why a maker of spark plugs and wiper blades has Wall Street worried,,"Financial problems at the maker of spark plugs, wiper blades, brake calipers, brake shoes, tow hitches and motor oil has caused intense anxiety on Wall Street in recent weeks. Car parts are not usually something that causes finance chiefs to lose much sleep. But the potentially multibillion-dollar financial crisis surrounding First Brands has them rattled. As ever in finance, it’s what investors don’t know that scares the most, and with First Brands, there appears to be plenty. What is First Brands? First Brands was founded by the Malaysian-born businessman Patrick James. Starting life as Ohio-based Crowne Group, James acquired Trico, best known for windshield wipers, and went on a debt-fueled acquisitions spree, snapping up auto-focused parts makers. James rechristening the company as First Brands Group in 2020. It now owns 24 automotive-related companies, according to the group’s website . “If your car is 10 years old, odds are good that parts from these companies are already on there,” notes the auto website CarBuzz. “And they were probably half the cost of original equipment parts sold through dealerships.” Seems like a sensible business. Why did it collapse? The company filed for bankruptcy protection in the southern district of Texas on 29 September due to creditor concern over the company’s use of opaque off-balance sheet financing, listing liabilities – what it owed – between $10bn and $50bn against assets – what it owned – of between $1bn and $10bn. But the speed of the First Brands implosion has spooked investors, and the more that’s known, the more they are spooked. The company had until recently had a decent cash buffer, but it was using private debt or “shadow banking” to borrow against invoices, in effect keeping debt off its balance-sheet disclosures, and turning a company with 26,000 employees into a finance company more than the supplier of auto parts. That system, known as factoring, is not unusual. But when the size of that debt, and who is holding it, becomes obscure, problems can rapidly accumulate, as the financial industry saw with the collapse of the UK fintech Greensill Capital in 2021 and London-listed firm Carillion in 2018. On Thursday, the technology group Raistone, which arranged some off-balance sheet financing, claimed that as much as $2.3bn had “simply vanished” as part of the bankrupt auto supplier’s failure. Jim Chanos, who predicted the Enron disaster in 2001, told the Financial Times that complex financial systems tend to flourish at the tail end of a boom when everyone wants in. “As long as everything works, nobody asks questions,” he said. “It isn’t until something stumbles, or the markets stumble, that people say, ‘Wait a minute, what are we doing here? This doesn’t make any sense.’” Why is Wall Street so worried? Just as in other financial crises – most recently the housing crisis that led to the 2008 financial meltdown – Wall Street is worried that the issues at First Brands are a sign of worse to come. The Texas auto lender Tricolor – which specialized in lending to low-income “sub-prime” lenders – collapsed last month amid fraud allegations . Ben Lourie, professor of accounting at the University of California, Irvine, says the issues at First Brands, and the collapse of Tricolor , connect because one was selling cut-price parts, and the other older cars, to consumers under economic pressure. “My guess is the companies went into bankruptcy because the market is not great and they started doing things they should not be doing. So they went into financial innovation with invoice financing,” Lourie says. “The fear is that the private debt market has been too hot, and [has been] giving out money, at high interest rates, to companies that just can’t pay it back, and especially to companies in the auto market,” he adds. Fears over what the failure of both companies portends are highlighting worries about what other issues the private debt markets may face. “The private debt market is much bigger than it used to be, and we can see that by companies pulling their IPOs because they are raising money in those markets,” says Lourie. “But there isn’t as much disclosure as there is in the public markets. So there is a disclosure issue because we don’t really know what’s going on.” He adds: “When there isn’t as much disclosure, there’s more risk, and there’s a fear of contagion, because somebody is going to have to take on these losses, and eventually it will reach up into the banks.” Jefferies, a midsized Wall Street lender, was advising First Brands, acting as lender against invoices through a specialist invoice-finance fund it manages, Point Bonita Capital, and placing billions of dollars of loans with other investors. Who those investors are, and how far the chain of debt stretches into the mainstream banking system, is an open question. Jefferies says it has $715m in exposure to First Brands. An investigation has been set up in part to examine whether invoices were pledged more than once. But it goes further, with concerns mounting that First Brands’ precarious arrangements could be found elsewhere. Brett House, an economics professor at Columbia Business School, says concerns are primarily about unregulated private debt markets and the assets they hold that are often not marked-to-market, an accounting system that values a company’s assets and liabilities at their current fair market value. “When these assets become impaired, it’s a surprise to markets, because there hadn’t been a gradual updating of information,” House says, “and because we don’t have great transparency on the location and concentration of where these assets are being held. And that can often have knock-on effects that are unanticipated.” So Wall Street got too clever for its own good, again. Why should I care? The worry is that the collapse of an obscure car parts company is the first domino, and that if more dominoes collapse, it could spread across the financial system, eventually triggering a wider crisis. Severe problems in the financial markets caused not by macro-economic conditions, but by the intricacies of capital management have happened before – the collapse of a high leveraged hedge fund, Long-Term Capital Management in 1998, that required a $3.6bn bailout, or the subprime mortgage loan crisis of 2007 that caused the collapse of Lehman Brothers and the onset of severe financial recession. Such analogies may not be exact, since the problems now being unearthed relate to private debt markets that expanded significantly after banks tightened lending standards after the 2008 crash. “The risk may sit in the balance sheets of funds and other asset managers that may create counterparty risk for large financial institutions that can cause reverberations from relatively obscure small funds hitting problems and create a cascading effect through the financial system that gets amplified by the structure of different asset classes and is unanticipated because of a lack of transparency,” says House. “It effectively means that unregulated parts of the debt and asset management market may hold risks that have implications for the entire financial system.”",https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/oct/10/first-brands-wall-street,Business,BBC,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ce738a5e7f3010d1712c456d87a8c480676bad70/333_0_3334_2667/master/3334.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=d39c5f1dbde41aed1eab7281920230eb",2025-10-10T10:00:51+00:00,1c33a4c3520f1d5a00435d1efa0795fbe18d8967
8a68cb2f3b93,Tony Blair and Nick Clegg hosted dinner giving tech bosses access to UK minister,,"Tony Blair and Nick Clegg hosted a private dinner earlier this year at which a select group of technology entrepreneurs were given access to a key minister, official documents have revealed. The former prime minister, who is a champion of the tech industry, held the dinner in an upmarket London hotel in his capacity as the head of the Tony Blair Institute (TBI) political consultancy. He and Clegg, the former deputy prime minister who at the time was a senior executive at Meta , invited leaders of six tech companies to dine with Poppy Gustafsson, who was the government’s investment minister responsible for persuading firms to invest in Britain. Blair is an evangelical proponent of the revolutionary potential of technology to transform faltering public services and has long courted alliances with leaders in the industry. His consultancy has echoed much of this zeal through a stream of policy papers arguing that artificial intelligence should be put at the heart of government. However, critics are concerned that Blair, who is known to be close to Keir Starmer’s government , has been able to set the agenda without enough public scrutiny. There have also been questions over the reliance of Blair’s consultancy on donations from the Silicon Valley billionaire Larry Ellison, a friend of Donald Trump and Elon Musk. Ellison, who this year briefly became the world’s richest person , has donated or promised more than $300m to Blair’s consultancy. The documents released to the Guardian under freedom of information legislation show how the 12 diners discussed the government’s evolving policies on artificial intelligence at what was described a “salon dinner”.

As the executive responsible for policy and global affairs that was literally his job.” A TBI spokesperson said: “This event was a discussion about a range of issues between tech leaders with a minister in attendance. No company paid to attend.” The companies represented at the dinner said they had not donated money to TBI, nor hired it. The dinner illustrates how Blair’s consultancy works to push his pro-technology agenda. Having rapidly expanded, TBI is active in 45 countries with its staff numbering more than 900 . Its latest accounts show its income totalled $145m in 2022 from a mixture of fees for its advice and donations. The identities of many of its donors and clients are kept secret. The consultancy has drawn criticism that its policy positions have been shaped by its donors’ commercial interests – an accusation it has denied . It was also criticised for continuing to take money from Saudi Arabia after the murder of the journalist Jamal Khashoggi in 2018. Blair is in line to play a leading role in the reconstruction of postwar Gaza. Weeks before the dinner, the government had given TBI a confidential summary of its action plan for artificial intelligence days before it was due to be published. On 9 January, Feryal Clark, then a minister in the Department for Science, Innovation and Technology (DSIT), spoke to Jakob Mokander, TBI’s science policy director, at her instigation. The next day, an aide to Clark emailed Mokander to say: “It was great talking to you yesterday. As a follow-up please see this confidential summary of the action plan. Thank you for agreeing to amplify publication of the plan on Monday through your network and supportive quotes.” Mokander replied: “Thank you for sharing the action plan (confidentiality noted).” Blair backed the action plan , aimed at expanding the country’s role in developing and deploying artificial intelligence, when it was published on 13 January . Asked why it had given early sight of this document to TBI, a spokesperson for the DSIT said: “We make no apologies for regularly engaging with stakeholders. It is standard practice to share embargoed information with them ahead of announcements.” The TBI spokesperson said: “It is standard practice for governments to consult experts and engage a wide range of stakeholders when shaping policy. The AI opportunities action plan rightly drew on our published work, as the footnotes make clear.” Quick Guide How to contact our investigations team Show The best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.

1d2d46f8ae10,Fifa seeks advice over banning league games staged overseas amid regulations redraft,,"Fifa has begun redrafting its regulations on staging domestic league games in foreign countries and is seeking legal advice over whether it can ban them. World football’s governing body would like to outlaw the practice but will be guided by legal opinion in its first review of the relevant regulations for 11 years. A source involved in the process said Fifa was working towards making its rulebook more robust with a view to new regulations being ready early next year. This week Uefa blamed the “relevant Fifa regulatory framework” for its decision to allow Villarreal v Barcelona to take place in Miami in December and Milan v Como to go ahead in Perth in February. That is understood to have caused considerable irritation at Fifa because under existing regulations it is not their decision to make. The regulations were written in 2014, when domestic leagues moving matches to overseas territories was not regarded as a live issue after the collapse of Premier League plans for a 39th game in 2008. The then Premier League chief executive Richard Scudamore’s proposal for an “international round” was ahead of its time, but fans were outraged and it was not pursued elsewhere. Fifa can block what its rulebook refers to as an “international match” only if the correct processes are not followed. The rules state that such matches must be authorised by the football associations of the participating clubs and of the territory where a game is to be played and by the respective confederations. La Liga and Serie A gave their approval at the start of the season before passing the matter to Uefa, which provided its ruling this week. The issue now rests with the host FAs – the US Soccer Federation and Football Australia – and their respective confederations, Concacaf and the Asian Football Confederation. La Liga has scheduled Villarreal v Barcelona for Inter Miami’s Hard Rock Stadium but US Soccer’s approval is not guaranteed because there are concerns that Major League Soccer would suffer commercially if European and possibly Mexican league games could also be staged in the country. Fifa is working towards its regulations being more clearcut despite concerns over its legal position. The US-based promoter Relevent Sports brought an anti-trust lawsuit against US Soccer in 2019 after a request for Barcelona to play Girona in Miami was denied the previous year, with Fifa named as co-defendants. skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Football Daily Kick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of football Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

4e6d1e88c516,TikTok influencers fuelling parallel market for unlicensed weight-loss drug,,"An online parallel market for an unlicensed weight-loss drug is being fuelled by TikTok fitness influencers and sellers on WhatsApp , a Guardian investigation can reveal. Retatrutide, which is still in clinical trials, is being advertised by social media influencers for its supposed fat-burning effects. Followers are urged to message the accounts privately for supplier links, as well as being provided with discount codes. Separately, there is a thriving trade on Telegram , where groups with thousands of members share “before and after” photos, injection guides and claims of next-day UK delivery. Sellers advertise the drug there before directing customers to WhatsApp for transactions. Retatrutide is an experimental injection developed by the US drugmaker Eli Lilly. The drug targets three gut hormones – GLP-1, GIP and glucagon. Early trials suggest it could help patients lose up to a quarter of their body weight. Nicknamed the “triple G”, the drug is being hailed online as the next Ozempic. However, doctors and pharmacists have warned that the sale of what is still an unlicensed drug in the UK is a cause for concern and could result in users injecting products of unknown origin. Some said the popularity of retatrutide could be linked to the rising cost of licensed weight loss products such as Mounjaro. Selling retatrutide on TikTok or Telegram is illegal in the UK, as it is an unlicensed drug that cannot be marketed or supplied for human use under the Human Medicines Regulations 2012. TikTok accounts of the influencer Jon Kluth and @MappyMyGains. Composite: TikTok Some influencers try to sidestep the rules by referring to the drug as a “research chemical” or citing it as “not for human consumption”. Retatrutide is not a controlled drug, but promotion and supply can still breach medicines, advertising, and consumer laws, risking fines, prosecution or prison. The TikTok influencer Jon Kluth, who is based in the US and has 226,500 followers, posted on the 26 June an update on his journey taking what he called “reta” for four weeks and that said followers could use “code Jon” to purchase it. He then links to an account that sells peptides called Halfnattys. When asked for a comment, Kluth did not respond and the account was taken down. Another account with a UK influencer called @MappyMyGains talks about retatrutide as a “gamechanger” on 21 September, and when followers ask where he gets the drug from he says “pm me mate”. He did not respond to a request for a comment. Another promoter called @clairejoy86 posted videos captions “day 10 of Reta … ” to the background track of the song Manchild by Sabrina Carpenter. Those who comment are told to message her for supply information. She did not respond to a request for comment and instead the account was taken down. The TikTok account of @clairejoy86. Composite: TikTok According to TikTok, the social media company has removed violative content and banned associated hashtags and search suggestions. It said it was dedicated to keeping the platform safe and invest in strengthening enforcement strategies. The Guardian also found groups with up to 9,000 members selling retatrutide using Telegram’s built-in discovery tool, which works like a public directory. Typing “retatrutide” instantly brings up channels with thousands of members, filled with photos of weight loss, glowing testimonials and step-by-step guides for mixing or injecting at home. Within minutes of joining one group, a seller posted WhatsApp details, where most transactions take place. The seller sent an instruction manual and promised delivery within 48 hours. When asked whether the product was genuine, one seller said: “You can’t be sure.” Another shared a photo of a supposed laboratory certificate. None asked about weight, medical conditions or previous experience. Inside these groups, posts show black plastic parcels with Royal Mail labels, claiming to contain new batches. One message read: “It took eight of us to load them this morning.” Buyers can choose between powder vials, mixed at home with sterile water, or pre-filled pens typically sold at £160 for 20mg. When asked how long a pen should last, sellers give conflicting answers ranging from a few weeks to “depends on your body”. A spokesperson for Telegram said it actively moderated harmful content on its platform including content that encouraged the “misuse of controlled medications”. It added that it removed “millions of pieces of harmful content each day”. Eli Lilly said retatrutide had not been reviewed or approved by any regulatory agency in the world. Photograph: Bloomberg/Getty Images Jason Murphy, the head of pharmacy at Chemist4U, said unregulated imports could be dangerous. “People are injecting substances they can’t verify. Even if the science behind retatrutide is sound, these online versions may not contain what they claim,” he said. Dr Crystal Wyllie of Asda Online Doctor linked the surge in demand to recent price rises for approved weight-loss drugs such as Mounjaro. “With costs increasing, patients are turning to social media. But counterfeit injections are extremely risky. You can’t be certain what’s inside or whether the environment they were made in was sterile,” she said. Her team has already seen patients harmed by self-injection from unverified sources. “We understand the frustration, but buying from Telegram or WhatsApp is gambling with your health,” said Wyllie. “These substances could be contaminated or incorrectly dosed.” A spokesperson from Eli Lilly said retatrutide was in phase 3 clinical trials and had not been reviewed or approved by any regulatory agency anywhere in the world. “Therefore at this time no one can sell [it] for human use,” they said, adding that any product “falsely representing itself as a Lilly investigational product not yet approved … may expose patients to potentially serious health risks”.

b09c54768647,AstraZeneca makes deal with Trump to lower drug prices and avoid tariffs,,"Donald Trump announced a deal with the British-based drugmaker AstraZeneca for a “most-favored-nation” drug-pricing model aimed at making prescription medicines more affordable and avoiding the administration’s tariff threats. The company will sell some medicines at a discount to the government’s Medicaid health plan in exchange for tariff relief, similar to a drug-pricing pact reached last week with Pfizer. Trump began the Oval Office announcement on Friday evening by boasting that he would have struck the deal sooner, but “we were interrupted by a rigged election”. AstraZeneca CEO Pascal Soriot, who was in attendance, said that during tough negotiations to reach a deal, Trump and his team of officials had “really kept me up at night”. The deals set a framework the White House will use to try to reach its goal of lowering US prescription medicine prices. The president sent letters to 17 leading drugmakers in July telling them to slash prices. Pfizer and AstraZeneca are the first two companies to reach a deal with the administration. Under the agreement, AstraZeneca will charge most-favored-nation pricing to Medicaid, while guaranteeing such pricing on newly launched drugs, Trump said. That involves matching the lowest price offered in other developed nations. “For many years, Americans have paid the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs, by far,” Trump said, adding that the new deal may cut prices to “the lowest price anywhere in the world. That’s what we get.” Trump went on to repeat the wildly false claim that the discounted prices for American consumers would reduce the price of prescription drugs by up to 1,000%. As Daniel Dale of CNN explained : “Cutting drug prices by more than 100% would mean that Americans would get paid to acquire their medications rather than paying for them.” A health economist, Timothy McBride, told the network Trump’s claims are “just not logical”, since a 500% price reduction would mean that a drug that now costs $100 would be available for free, with consumers given a $400 rebate. The actual deal with AstraZeneca includes cutting prices for the government’s Medicaid health plan for low-income Americans and discounted prices through a “TrumpRx” website, the president said. Pfizer previously agreed to drop prescription drug prices in the Medicaid program for lower-income Americans to what it charges in other developed countries in exchange for relief from tariffs threatened by Trump. More than 70 million people are covered by Medicaid, the state and federal government program for low-income people. Drug spending in that program is dwarfed by that of Medicare, which covers people aged 65 and older or those with disabilities and is not included in Friday’s announcement. The Medicaid program already receives the lowest drug prices in the US, so the additional savings may be modest, said Craig Garthwaite, a professor at Northwestern University’s Kellogg School of Management. “If you look at AstraZeneca’s portfolio, I don’t think there are a bunch of drugs that exist where that’s going to involve them giving a very big discount to Medicaid,” Garthwaite said. Americans currently pay by far the most for prescription medicines, often nearly three times more than in other developed nations, and Trump has been pressuring drugmakers to lower their prices to what patients pay elsewhere or face stiff tariffs. Last month, Trump threatened 100% tariffs on drugmakers, increasing pressure on the pharmaceutical industry to agree to price cuts and shift manufacturing to the US. “The tariffs were a big reason he came here,” Trump said of AstraZeneca’s CEO Soriot. AstraZeneca’s Pfizer‑like deal may spare it tariffs, but will not move the needle on US rising health insurance premiums and out‑of‑pocket drug costs, said Rena Conti, an associate professor at Boston University. “It’s good for the companies, and has very uncertain if any benefit for Americans struggling with the affordability of prescription drugs,” Conti said.",https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/10/trump-astrazeneca-drug-prices,Business,BBC,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b07c6d3e737bf36c7572722325449448276937aa/258_0_3298_2639/master/3298.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=e363f01cdd4e0c0e24fc2b3dd120a6dc",2025-10-10T23:51:58+00:00,92124b39fc87c2b283ef05518fe907f0adcf4bd5
b671a2fd2f7a,"No survivors in Tennessee explosives factory blast, officials say",,"There were no survivors in the blast that obliterated part of an explosives factory in rural Tennessee , authorities said on Saturday. The families of 18 people had been waiting anxiously on Saturday as their loved ones had been feared dead since explosions ripped through the plant near McEwen in western Tennessee early on Friday. The initial toll had been believed to be 19 people but that figure was later revised. The Humphreys county sheriff, Chris Davis, spoke to the public and media early on Saturday afternoon and revealed that authorities were assuming that anybody who was inside the building that exploded the day before was dead. Satellite imagery of Accurate Energetic Systems in McEwen, Tennessee, on 3 April 2021 (top), and on 10 October 2025 (bottom). Photograph: Vantor/AFP/Getty Images Davis said the tragedy was even “more devastating” than had been thought. In the close-knit community, he and other members of law enforcement and many in the community know people who were victims of the disaster. The blast was felt for miles as it leveled a building at the 1,300-acre headquarters of Accurate Energetic Systems (AES), which is located in the tiny community of Bucksnort, just south of McEwen, about an hour’s drive west of Nashville. “More than 300 people have been through almost every square inch of this facility, and at this time, we’ve recovered no survivors,” an emotional Davis told reporters early on Saturday afternoon. “It’s a great loss to our communities.” Officials did not offer a precise death toll but have previously said 18 people were unaccounted for. Davis confirmed the operation had shifted from rescue to recovery and that investigators would use DNA testing to confirm the identities of those who are assumed to have died. Investigators, including agents from the FBI and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, were still working to determine the cause of the explosion, officials said. The presence of explosives and other ordnance at the property has made searching the scene complicated. Initially, first responders were not able to get close to the scene of devastation because of secondary explosions. In a statement on Friday, the company thanked first responders but did not indicate a possible cause. Humphreys county sheriff Chris Davis tells reporters no survivors were recovered from the blast, in Bucksnort, Tennessee, on Saturday.

AES develops, manufactures and stores explosives for “military, aerospace and commercial demolition markets”, according to the company’s website.

e46fc8b42012,‘Death to Spotify’: the DIY movement to get artists and fans to quit the music app,,"T his month, indie musicians in Oakland, California, gathered for a series of talks called Death to Spotify , where attenders explored “what it means to decentralize music discovery, production and listening from capitalist economies”. The events, held at Bathers library, featured speakers from indie station KEXP, labels Cherub Dream Records and Dandy Boy Records, and DJ collectives No Bias and Amor Digital. What began as a small run of talks quickly sold out and drew international interest. People as far away as Barcelona and Bengaluru emailed the organizers asking how to host similar events. A Death to Spotify event at Bathers library in Oakland, California, on 23 September. Photograph: Denise Heredia The talks come as the global movement against Spotify edges into the mainstream. In January, music journalist Liz Pelly released Mood Machine, a critical history arguing the streaming company has ruined the industry and turned listeners into “passive, uninspired consumers”. Spotify’s model, she writes, depends on paying artists a pittance – less still if they agree to be “playlisted” on its Discovery mode, which rewards the kind of bland, coffee-shop muzak that fades neatly into the background. Artists have long complained about paltry payouts, but this summer the criticism became personal, targeting Spotify’s billionaire co-founder Daniel Ek for his investment in Helsing, a German firm developing AI for military tech. Groups including Massive Attack, King Gizzard & the Lizard Wizard, Deerhoof and Hotline TNT pulled their music from the service in protest. (Spotify has stressed that “Spotify and Helsing are two separate companies”.) Mood Machine: the Rise of Spotify and the Costs of the Perfect Playlist by Liz Pelly. Photograph: Hodder In Oakland, California, Stephanie Dukich read Mood Machine, heard about the boycotts, and was inspired. Dukich, who investigates complaints against the city’s police, was part of a reading group about digital media at Bathers library. Though she is not a musician, Dukich describes herself, along with her friend and art gallery worker Manasa Karthikeyan, as “really into sound”. She and Karthikeyan decided to start similar conversations. “Spotify is enmeshed in how we engage with music,” Dukich says. “We thought it would be great to talk about our relationship to streaming – what it means to actually take our files off and learn how to do that together.” Death to Spotify was born. The goal, in short, was “down with algorithmic listening, down with royalty theft, down with AI-generated music”. Karthikeyan says the responsibility of quitting Spotify lies as much with listeners as artists. “You have to accept that you won’t have instant access to everything,” she says. “That makes you think harder about what you support.” But will either musicians or listeners actually have the nerve to actually boycott the app longterm? Several famous musicians have pulled their catalogues from Spotify with big, headline-grabbing announcements over the years, only to quietly come crawling back to the platform after some time. One of the app’s most popular artists, Taylor Swift, boycotted the service for three years in protest of its unfair payment practices but returned in 2017. Radiohead’s frontman. Thom Yorke, removed some his solo projects for the same reason in 2013, calling Spotify “the last desperate fart of a dying corpse”; he later put them back. Spotify’s end game is for you not to think about what’s playing Will Anderson of Hotline TNT Neil Young and Joni Mitchell left the app in 2022, citing the company’s exclusive deal with anti-vax podcast host Joe Rogan; both Canadian singer-songwriters contracted polio as children in the 1950s. They, too, later restored their catalogues on Spotify. Eric Drott, a professor of music at the University of Texas at Austin, says the new wave of boycotts feels different. “These acts are less famous. For years, artists knew streaming wouldn’t make them rich but needed the visibility. Now there’s so much music out there, people are questioning whether it’s doing much for them.” Will Anderson, frontman of Hotline TNT, says there’s “a 0% chance” his band will return. “It doesn’t make sense for true music lovers to be on there,” he says. “Spotify’s end game is for you not to think about what’s playing.” When the band sold their new record Raspberry Moon directly through Bandcamp and a 24-hour Twitch stream, they sold hundreds of copies and “generated thousands of dollars”. Manasa Karthikeyan (left) and Stephanie Dukich. Photograph: Eva Tuff Others such as pop-rock songwriter Caroline Rose are experimenting too. Her album Year of the Slug came out only on vinyl and Bandcamp, inspired by Cindy Lee’s Diamond Jubilee, which was initially available only on YouTube and the filesharing site Mega. “I find it pretty lame that we put our heart and soul into something and then just put it online for free,” Rose says. Rose is a member of the Union of Musicians and Allied Workers (UMAW), an advocacy group formed at the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic to protect music workers. Joey DeFrancesco, a member of the punk rock band Downtown Boys and co-founder of UMAW, says the group “unequivocally supports artists taking agency, holding corporations accountable, and making splashes [such as taking music off Spotify] to push back at the company”. At the same time, DeFrancesco says, that kind of individualized boycotting has its “limits”. “What we try to do in the labor movement and at UMAW is to act collectively,” he adds. Examples include UMAW’s successful campaign (alongside the Austin for Palestine Coalition) to pressure the music festival South by Southwest to drop the US army and weapons manufacturers as sponsors for the 2025 event, and the Living Wages for Musicians Act, sponsored by representative Rashida Tlaib, a bill that would regulate Spotify payouts to artists. The Death to Spotify organizers say their goal is not necessarily to shut the app down. “We just want everyone to think a little bit harder about the ways they listen to music,” Karthikeyan says. “It just flattens culture at its core if we only stick to this algorithmically built comfort zone.”",https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/oct/12/spotify-boycott-artists,Business,BBC,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/eaf4cf4e2b16069b9f551d2c1cec86d72b8d7f40/557_0_4993_3992/master/4993.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=5dd877fe3e50f7f289cd58c1e1dc8fb7",2025-10-12T14:00:54+00:00,39e0d645b752f0d6bb4d3b03217b8ae244cda5e9
54c2f780925b,What price loyalty? UK supermarket cards rated,,"Got washing to do? Would you rather pay £16 for Ariel washing pods or £8? Thirsty? How about £5 or nearly £8 for a dozen Diet Cokes. Hungry? £2.50 a pop for Pringles or £1.75? The lower prices are among the current “top picks” for Tesco Clubcard holders – and it’s a similar story in other big supermarkets. With the cost of groceries rising, it no longer makes sense to shop without joining a loyalty scheme when it is on offer. That explains why 24 million UK households now have a Clubcard. Tesco says the deals mean shoppers save up to £375 off their annual grocery bill compared with its regular prices. Sainsbury’s claims its Nectar scheme can save more than £450. The widespread use of loyalty discounts has gradually seduced even the sceptical, with 76% of consumers now in a scheme, according to Mintel. The market researcher says close to 60% of us subscribe to four or more, helping to stretch the definition of loyalty. Nick Carroll, the Mintel director of retail insight, says in the current tough economic climate “instant savings” are important. “We’re in a period of very high food inflation, and that means people want savings now, not in six months.” Carroll suggests the loyalty schemes which are a new spin on store promotions “do save customers money”. But if they weren’t there, the big supermarkets “would still need to be price competitive”. During the cost of living crisis the sudden fashion for loyalty card price cuts attracted the scrutiny of the Competition and Markets Authority . The CMA went on to review 50,000 products with loyalty price options and found 92% offered a saving against the supermarkets’ usual price. It concluded that shoppers in supermarket loyalty schemes can make “genuine savings”. However, the watchdog also offered some advice: “Our review has shown that loyalty prices aren’t always the cheapest option, so shopping around is still key.” We’ve rated the current crop of supermarket schemes, and given them an overall score based on upfront discounts, rewards and other perks. Tesco The Tesco Clubcard works on a point-based system. Photograph: True Images/Alamy You earn one point for every £1 spent on shopping at Tesco. You can also accrue points at its other businesses such as its fuel stations and Tesco Mobile but the qualifying spend varies. A point is worth 1p when converted into Clubcard vouchers, which can be spent in Tesco or exchanged for twice their face value at more than 100 “reward” partners, including Pizza Express and Legoland. More important these days is its “Clubcard prices” promotion. With 10,000 deals every week the offers claim to save a Tesco regular £375 on their annual grocery bill. Pros Members-only prices include a discount on Tesco’s popular meal deal – the price recently increased to £3.85 but is £4.25 for non-cardholders. Tesco uses your data to serve up personalised discounts, while a new “Tesco Tuesdays” deal offers film fans up to four standard 2D Cineworld tickets for £5 each (or £2.50 in Clubcard vouchers at double their value). Cons Some would argue it is no longer in your interests to shop at Tesco without a Clubcard as it involves paying over the odds for your groceries. Also the rewards are stingier these days – at one point you could cash in vouchers for four times the face value. Overall rating 8/10 Sainsbury’s Argos is part of the Sainsbury’s Nectar scheme. Photograph: Michael McHugh/PA Shoppers earn one Nectar point for every £1 spent in-store or online. A point is worth 0.5p and can be spent in blocks of 500 (worth £2.50). You can also collect (and spend) points elsewhere as the scheme boasts 500-plus partners including big names such as British Airways and Marriott Bonvoy. With 27 million users, Nectar has taken the fight to Clubcard. The supermarket claims that “Nectar Prices” can save you more than £450 a year. It says Nectar Prices save you £323, plus potentially another £169 based on the average weekly saving from “Your Nectar Prices”. The latter is its personalised pricing offer, providing up to 10 weekly deals based on your shopping habits. Pros Sainsbury’s says Nectar Prices alone can save customers a chunky £13 on an £80 basket of shopping. Also with lots of other companies, including big high street brands such as Argos, as part of the scheme, it is possible to collect points on a big chunk of everyday spending. Cons In the same vein as Tesco, it is mad to shop there without a Nectar card. With a Nectar point worth 0.5p to Clubcard’s 1p, you need to spend twice as much to earn vouchers. However, with lots of ways to collect points this could balance out. Overall rating 8/10 Asda The Asda Rewards app. Photograph: mundissima/Alamy For Asda Rewards you have to download an app – there is no physical card available. Users earn pounds rather than points when they complete “missions”, which may involve shopping a certain number of times or buying particular products. (Sample missions: spend £5 on ready meals, or £7 on sports drinks, to earn £1.) These pounds go into your “cashpot” and are converted into vouchers to spend at Asda. There are about 6.4 million active customers. Pros Asda says some customers earn hundreds of pounds a year by completing all the missions, linking up their Asda credit card, using the various coupons and so on. The money can be spent on your shopping, so saves on the things you want to buy. Cons You pay the full price upfront and get money off later rather than an immediate discount. It is only available via an app. Overall rating 4/10 Lidl The Lidl Plus app. Photograph: True Images/Alamy The app-based loyalty scheme Lidl Plus gives you access to special offers that refresh weekly – current offers include 27% off Rubicon mango juice and 20% off granola. You can also get personalised coupons in the app that are based on your shopping habits – you need to opt in to these. There’s “Coupon Plus”, which unlocks rewards such as a free in-store “bakery sweet treat” when you spend £10 in a month, and 10% off your next shop (up to a maximum discount of £20) if you spend £250 in a month. Pros As well as immediate discounts it offers “exclusive discounts and benefits” from its partners, such as £65 off holiday bookings with Jet2holidays and up to 40% off cinema tickets. In July the retailer announced it would be introducing a new self-scanning feature within the Lidl Plus app. It will let customers scan products as they shop, track their spending and savings in real time and complete their purchases at a self-checkout terminal, all through the app. Cons The consumer group Which? is among those to have highlighted Lidl Plus as a scheme that is only accessible via an app, with an email address also required. That means the big savings available via the scheme are off-limits to those who cannot or do not wish to go digital. You have to actively opt in to get some of the savings. Overall rating 7/10 Co-op The Co-op offers a membership scheme. Photograph: Andy Rain/EPA You pay a one-off £1 to become a member of the Co-op (and can claim this back against your first in-store offer). This gets you a virtual and physical card that gives you some discounts and other perks. There are some members-only prices – recent deals include 65p off Mr Kipling Lemon Slices and 70p off Co-op Fairtrade chocolate – and access to discounts that price-match 100 products to their Aldi equivalent. You can also choose two of several weekly personalised offers, based on your shopping habits. These may include £1 off your shop or money off specific items. To add some fun, there are in-app games with vouchers for prizes, as well as a monthly prize draw – you get an entry for each £5 you spend. Pros You can save money straight away with some of the offers. You get a say in how the Co-op is run and can help choose a local charity for the business to support. It is also available to 16- and 17-year-olds, unlike other schemes. Cons It costs £1 to join; not all Co-op societies are involved. Overall rating 5/10 Waitrose There was delight among shoppers when Waitrose brought back its free hot drink offer. Photograph: David Gee 4/Alamy With 4.6 million members, the benefits of the supermarket’s My Waitrose scheme include personalised money-saving vouchers, free hot drinks and 20% off selected service counter products such as “big cheese Thursday” and “fish Friday”. Pros Free hot drinks. It caused outrage when this element was dropped during the coronavirus pandemic and its return at the start of this year was met with joy. You need to have your reusable cup on you but given the price of coffee these days it’s a freebie that’s not to be sniffed at. Cons The proposition feels underwhelming compared with the might of Clubcard and Nectar but a current trial in 18 shops called “little treats” suggests it could be about to become more generous. The trial offers shoppers up to three “little treats”, such as a free product, or money-off voucher each month, based on how much they spend. Overall rating 6/10 Marks & Spencer The Marks & Spencer Sparks storecard. Photograph: Michael Melia/Alamy Marks & Spencer says Sparks is about giving customers “treats and thank yous for shopping with us”. These include personalised offers across its clothing, home and food departments, and there is also a birthday treat that could include Percy Pigs, Swiss truffles or prosecco (if you have supplied your birthdate). There is also a coffee loyalty scheme in its cafes and a baby club called The Parent Hood with offers such as 10% off babygrows for new parents. Pros Sparks clothing discounts are worth keeping an eye out for as they can result in a big saving, especially for families with growing kids, and with its womenswear feted in the fashion press, it can help bring down the cost of a new outfit. Customers can also donate to the causes they care about, with M&S donating 1p to their chosen charity every time they buy something. And come on … who doesn’t want a free bag of Percy Pigs on their birthday? Cons: On a day-to-day basis it doesn’t feel there’s a compelling reason to scan your card at the till but it’s worth checking the app and loading the latest offers as, particularly for clothing and home, these can result in welcome savings. Overall rating 4/10 Morrisons Every week Morrisons offers a range of products at a More Card price. Photograph: Mark Collinson/Alamy The More Card offers a mixture of loyalty prices, targeted offers and the chance to earn points that are turned into vouchers once you have accrued enough – you need to build up 5,000 points, which you can then turn into £5. Every week a range of products are offered at a More Card price – some of these are straightforward price cuts, while others are multi-buy offers that only apply if you are a member. You earn five points for every product you buy and can also opt into “points boosters” so that when you buy particular products you will earn extra points towards a voucher – for example, you might be offered 400-1,200 points on spending on Branston products. Pros There are some upfront savings, although these do not really stand out from the other offers and discounts being advertised. You can choose to donate your points to the charity Marie Curie. You can earn extra points towards vouchers when you shop with partner retailers including eBay, Dunelm and Deliveroo. Cons There are not as many immediate discounts as available via Nectar and Clubcard – each week the number of items at More Card prices is in the hundreds rather than thousands. You have to build up £5 worth of points before you can get the money, and the points expire after 12 months. Overall rating 6/10 The Which? view: not all discounts are equal Every month the consumer group Which? compares the average price of shopping across eight of the UK’s biggest supermarkets. In September the cheapest store for its shopping list of 71 items was Aldi. The discounter does not have a loyalty scheme. For a bigger trolley load of 186 items, it found that Asda continued to be cheaper than shopping at Tesco with a Clubcard and remained one of the UK’s cheapest supermarkets. (Aldi and Lidl are not included in this comparison as they have a smaller range of products compared with the other supermarkets.) Reena Sewraz, the Which? retail editor, says: “Supermarket loyalty cards can be a useful way to save money but our research shows that not all discounts are as good as they appear, and while most people have signed up to at least one, millions of people can’t access loyalty prices at all because of age limits or digital requirements. That means deals on everyday essentials aren’t always as fair or inclusive as they should be. “The best approach is to use loyalty cards where you already shop, but don’t rely on them for the lowest prices. Compare across supermarkets – Aldi and Lidl often come out cheapest – and only stock up on items you were planning to buy anyway. That way, you’ll be sure to benefit from real savings.” This article was amended on 12 October 2025 to correct details of the Co-op loyalty scheme. The £1 joining fee is paid once, not annually; and this fee can be claimed back against the cost of your first in-store shop. Also, two offers can be chosen each week from several personalised selections.",https://www.theguardian.com/money/2025/oct/11/uk-supermarket-loyalty-cards-prices-rated-clubcard-nectar,Business,BBC,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9e579a8aa4523cc0361450eed1807e35b515987e/385_0_3172_2538/master/3172.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=8c4440cae2e003663bc5d453968b1b54",2025-10-11T06:00:18+00:00,4092195e9fd9d66bfea78fe84a50fc08f7f5ef04
6d3d1976f20f,‘It gets a bit dirty after 2am’: overtourism debate centre stage as Abta meets in Mallorca,,"T he swish seafront hotels and freshly planted palms on the gleaming promenade might tempt any unwary holidaymaker to book in for Mallorca’s Calviá beach. But step out the back door and the resort is still firmly, as it is better known, Magaluf: boozed-up Britain in Spain , with cocktails by the pint. Mallorca got most of the Balearics’ 3.5 million UK visitors last year: for some residents, far too many. The island has become emblematic of the most heated debate in travel: overtourism – and how to tackle it. The island’s Calviá region, home of Magaluf, this week played host to the annual Abta convention for Britain’s tourism industry. And tourism doesn’t get much more industrial than here. Straight out from an evening bash at the upmarket Nikki Beach club, a short walk through British pubs, kebab shops and purveyors of I ❤️ DOGGY STYLE T-shirts led delegates to the party end of the Strip, where bar ambassadors come out in force to lure in the punters. “Beer and two shots, four euros?” one offers. The Guardian declines. The man reconsiders: “Titties?” Prominent signs in English advise €300-€400 (£261-£348) penalties for nudity, fighting and drunkenness on the street. On an October weeknight, the patrolling police aren’t overstretched – but it’s early yet, only midnight, and as one seasoned resident warns: “It gets a bit dirty after 2am.” Street signs in English warning of fines for behaviour along the Magaluf Strip. Photograph: Gwyn Topham/The Guardian But the main business was in the Abta conference hall. Debates on overtourism and homilies on “slow travel” peppered the agenda for an industry grappling with the realisation that, despite the tantalising invitations on the Strip, not everyone wants them there. Mallorca is one of many destinations where locals have demonstrated against overtourism: this June, thousands marched through the capital in protest. But diagnoses of the problem – and potential remedies in a country whose annual flow of Britons exceeds all others – divided the convention. The strategy in Spain ’s new marketing campaign is chasing diversification rather than numbers: urging visitors to go inland, stay longer, try things such as “astrotourism and oleo tourism”, watching the next eclipse from a parador and sampling the olive oil. Steve Heapy, chief executive of mass market holiday operator Jet2, read the runes: “They want less tourists, but they want them to be richer. I don’t think it’s very fair. Why should holidays be only available to a certain subset of the population?” Prices in lesser-visited Galicia up north were even cheaper, Spain’s tourist office protested. UK director Manuel Butler says: “Like fast fashion, we have had fast tourism … We have to slow down, have more contact with people and explore more deeply the destination.” Tourism should be “resilient, inclusive, and beneficial to visitors and residents alike” – and places such as Magaluf, he says, “have to target a different clientele, people are who not looking to get drunk and make a noise. It’s the reality.” A decade-long strategy in Palma has massively increased its stock of small upmarket hotels for year-round breaks; it is bidding to become Spain’s next European capital of culture. Calvía and Magaluf have been following on a similar path: 80% of the hotels are now four or five star. Tens of millions of euros have been invested in cleaning up and improving the beach. And, as Calvía’s mayor Juan Antonio Amengual Guasp proudly told the auditorium, Magaluf now hosts a literary festival. It is a difficult balance for a place reliant on tourist income, with expats also a significant population; Amengual says Magaluf has “achieved a harmonious relationship between tourists and residents over the decades, and that has not changed.” But, he concedes, local discontent with tourism was “a reality” worldwide. English breakfast in Magaluf. Photograph: Schoening/Alamy The UK managing director of the travel giant Tui, Neil Swanson, was conciliatory: “They are in charge, right? Clearly we’re bringing money into the local economy, but it’s got to work for you in other social ways, and maybe not all tourism has. It needs to feel right for the local community, and for the guests coming in.” Abta’s chief executive, Mark Tanzer, says: “If you can extract more value that’s good.” But, he adds: “If they don’t want us, we won’t go. People like Jet2 will fly their planes somewhere else.” Heapy says the anti-tourism protests were having an impact, albeit small, after headlines about kill-a-tourist graffiti in Tenerife: “We’ve had many people writing into us and ringing our call centre saying, is it safe to go to Spain?” skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Business Today Get set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morning Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He says the word overtourism was really describing “poor tourism management”, citing private rentals such as Airbnb as the bigger problem. “Licensed tourism, people going on a holiday, staying in a hotel etc, it’s perfectly easy to manage it – you know how many people are coming.” Spain hopes trips will spread over longer seasons as hotter summers shift demand. Visitor numbers from January to May this year were 9% higher than in 2019, while the peak summer months remained static. Heapy is unconvinced: “People want that Mediterranean holiday in the summer months. I live in Manchester. It’s pretty grim – it’s cold, dark and wet. I want to get away to the sun, and if it’s hot, well great.” Others sense further change ahead. “You’ve got to look to see what’s coming,” says Cathy Sasson, owner of Pirates, a Magaluf landmark whose “swashbuckling immersive dinner show” (★★★★★ – the Daily Star) claims to have entertained 4 million people over 40 years. “A few years ago nobody served calamari. Now if you’re in a restaurant and it didn’t have salt and pepper squid you’d be disappointed.” Pirates sticks resolutely to one meal: chicken and chips with corn on the cob, even for its late-night adult show. But Magaluf, she says, is “not what it was in the old days”. Is she sad? “No – my dad would never let me out!” Nonetheless, she says: “No one wants people to stop drinking. We’re Brits, we go on holiday, and we like a drink. But it’s how they come and how they drink.” On the Strip, the lunchtime after the night before, barmaid Emma is opening up at Lennons pub and putting the bins out. “I think it probably will change,” she says, smiling a little sadly. Only one punter is here this early, Steve Davis, 75, from Coventry, holidaying to visit family here. He shows a photo of himself 17 years ago dressed as Elvis, in the nearby Three Lions pub: “I couldn’t remember, but my niece said it was in Magaluf.” These parts, he says, haven’t altered much: “I’ll be here till closing.” His Heineken and Guinnesses, though, are zero-alcohol: “Cirrhosis of the liver.” Ainhoa Paredes Penades, a journalist with Telecinco, grew up in Calvía, when visiting Magaluf upset her: “All the people working there were talking to me in English, I felt a stranger in my own island.” Now, she says, Spanish locals have rediscovered Magaluf. “This summer, several friends asked me if I’d been, saying the water is really clear. They wanted to transform Magaluf as a better tourist destination – but now there are more Mallorcans going there with their family as well. You see the change.”",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/oct/10/mallorca-finds-itself-central-to-debate-on-overtourism-dividing-abta-convention-travel,Business,BBC,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/16658701579629b751d389a50a9e55fb77a7cf48/141_0_3901_3120/master/3901.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=1531b191e0c9640a6daefc9c38507648",2025-10-10T14:37:17+00:00,7910a797a0b94dfb5483f94c68e957f4000ab3fd

Why ‘Goldilocks’ jeans are having a moment",,"When it comes to fashion power struggles, there is no greater battle than the one between baggy and skinny jeans. But now a new style is emerging, or is it an old one? The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link. Learn more . Goldilocks jeans – ie straight cut – have made a comeback. Think Robert Redford in Three Days of the Condor, rather than Jeremy Clarkson’s bootcut Top Gear era or an indie band’s painted-on pip-squeezers. Leon Hedgepeth, a menswear writer who coined the term “Goldilocks jeans”, describes the style as “not too skinny, not too baggy – just right”. Levi’s’ bestselling jeans of all time – the 501, worn by everyone from Marlon Brando to Steve Jobs and Kate Moss – best encapsulates the shape. Straight talking … the Apple co-founder Steve Jobs in 2011. Photograph: AP Anne-Catherine Lepas, the vice-president of merchandising at Levi’s Europe, says the brand defines a straight cut such as the 501 as running evenly from hip to ankle, “creating a clean, effortless look that suits almost everyone”. Sales of straight-cut jeans are up 30% year on year at John Lewis, with top sellers including a £260 pair from the US label Frame. On Thursday, the British department store chain released a collaboration with the designer Rejina Pyo . While a cropped fluffy jacket was tipped to be a favourite from the collection, instead the straight-cut jeans in a dark-blue wash are soaring to the top of the sales chart. Elsewhere on the high street, six years after Marks & Spencer launched its Sienna straight-cut jeans, it is once again a bestselling style. Its recent Stovepipe iteration – which features a higher waist and less elastane, meaning it does not give as much, so hangs straighter – is also in demand. Lights, camera, fashion … Robert Redford frequently wore straight-cut jeans on and off screen. Photograph: David Parker/Alamy This shift to normality points to consumers’ growing fatigue with fashion’s trend cycle. Micro trends that start on social media, often with the suffix “-core” – such as “Barbiecore” and “cottagecore” – have accelerated this shift even further, with some shoppers feeling constantly outmanoeuvred. As a result, some consumers are giving their wardrobe a hard reset with a return to timeless basics. So less boom boom and more bore bore. A pair of jeans such as the 501s, which originated in 1873 and was commonly worn by miners, fulfil the brief. On Friday, Levi’s reported that revenues grew 7% to $1.5bn (£1.1bn) during its third fiscal quarter. skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Fashion Statement Style, with substance: what's really trending this week, a roundup of the best fashion journalism and your wardrobe dilemmas solved Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

They can also be sourced secondhand, which appeals to more conscious shoppers . Keir Starmer and Yvette Cooper. The UK prime minister usually opts for dark-wash denim. Photograph: Stefan Rousseau/PA Elsewhere, when Vogue revealed that Chloe Malle would be its new head of editorial content , the 39-year-old wore a pair of “normal” jeans in a photograph to accompany the announcement. And it’s not just women – the UK prime minister, Keir Starmer, favours a darker wash and trainers. Meanwhile, the designer Jonathan Anderson stuck to his signature style – vintage Levi’s – as he took a bow after his Dior womenswear debut at Paris fashion week. He has also included a pair of normies in his collaboration with Uniqlo, which launches next week. Alongside trend fatigue, Hedgepeth credits 90s nostalgia and economic uncertainty with driving interest in normie denims. “A sluggish economy has everyone thinking twice before dropping £500 on novelty pants. Straight-leg jeans are the antidote: timeless, unfussy, and a safe bet that won’t make you regret not buying into the next skinny v baggy denim war.”",https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2025/oct/11/baggy-skinny-or-neither-why-goldilocks-jeans-are-having-a-moment,Business,BBC,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e2289c30e521e28cf5a47c240224a237384089a2/0_581_4379_3503/master/4379.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=a15c8b53da3bc6ec762f0410970e33ac",2025-10-11T07:00:17+00:00,e48aa95935fd095c296403fb7f50bf14779f6c15
9478114a4784,The non-profit helping people from all over the world to become successful game developers,,"G amescom, the annual video game convention held in Cologne, Germany, is a unique event. It not only draws hundreds of thousands of players to pack out vast convention halls each year, but it also hosts professionals, offering them a chance to get their games into the hands of fans, and gives industry hopefuls a shot at passing their résumés to developers. For those based outside the US, it is the biggest event of the year by far. It is the International Game Developers Association (IGDA) Foundation’s first year here, and executive director Alyssa Walles is excited. The IGDA Foundation provides professional development for underrepresented and marginalised people hoping to enter the video game industry, a crucial service considering the many barriers prospective producers, developers and writers face. Though Walles is fairly new to the IGDA Foundation, having joined three years ago, she is a video game industry veteran. She knows how crucial it is to help those who aren’t born into privileged situations, who can’t afford to travel across the globe to conventions, or have not had traditional schooling in computer design or coding. Gamescom hosts video game fans and industry professionals. Photograph: Imago/Alamy “I was part of the launch team of PlayStation in Europe, and I was the only woman in the room most of the time,” Walles says. “So I am so happy to see that change.” But she knows there is more work to be done. The IGDA Foundation started by funding trips for a select group to the annual Game Developers Conference in San Francisco, an expensive endeavour that often excludes hundreds of developers from marginalised communities or more remote regions of the world. When the Covid pandemic redefined video game events, the IGDA Foundation had to get creative – that’s when former executive director Nika Nour came up with the Virtual Exchange, a six-week online programme that pairs grantees with a veteran game industry coach. Out of hundreds of annual applications, the IGDA Foundation selects grantees from three main pillars: games career professionals looking for more senior roles, professionals trying to transition into the games industry and recent graduates. Alyssa Walles of the IGDA Foundation. Photograph: Courtesy IGDA Foundation Walles says: “My favourite example of someone in our cohort who has work experience but is trying to break into the games industry is this young man from Nigeria. He’s a home builder, he’s project managing every day, building houses – and he codes. He wants to take that project management experience and become a producer in video games.” For Walles and many other industry veterans who become mentors with the IGDA Foundation, it is about using their experience to ensure the industry has a strong and diverse future. “I’m 65, I’m not afraid about saying that … I’m on the back end of my career, and I’m here to give back,” she says. But the IGDA Foundation, like so many other programmes dedicated to making the video game industry and tech spaces more equitable, has faced frustrating challenges in the last few years. After meteoric growth during the pandemic, the industry has seen record redundancies. Companies are telling Walles they don’t have money for the foundation, which she finds hard to believe (“I know you have $5,000”), and though the IGDA Foundation isn’t government-funded, the Trump administration and Elon Musk’s “department of government efficiency” (Doge) have attacked diversity, equity and inclusivity institutions, which forces them to rethink how they market their programme and how to approach potential donors. “There have been several nonprofits that have had to close in our space. So far, we are not close to that. I worry about it every day,” Walles admits. “I think, how do I get to the people who have made a lot of money in video games and want to support that next generation?” 2025’s Virtual Exchange in action. Photograph: Courtesy IGDA Foundation But the IGDA Foundation, with Walles at the helm, is not afraid to get creative. Last year, she saw a story in a newsletter about how a solo developer made significant money from a single piece of downloadable content (DLC) sold in a Steam bundle. “I reached out to the IDGA Foundation’s alumni network and said, ‘I want to do a Steam event with DLC,’ and someone stepped forward to manage it. We created Download for Charity, an event we had in May – we had 24 games participate and raised $24,000,” Walles says.

75bc6f130354,‘We don’t want to be a toy town’: has Brexit sunk this historic UK fishing fleet?,,"A small flotilla of gaily coloured fishing boats line the shingle beach at Hastings, East Sussex. Behind them are the bulldozers that shunt them into the waves and beyond, in neat rows, are black wooden fishermen’s huts and fish stalls, where on a good day teenage daughters, wives and retired skippers sell some of the day’s catch. This is the Stade, a Saxon word for “landing place” from where wooden boats have set off since before William the Conqueror arrived in 1066. But a decline in Britain’s fishing industry has hit many coastal communities hard. Hastings, home to one of the UK’s oldest fleets and the largest beach-launched fleet in Europe, is one of the worst hit. The fleet, which had 53 registered boats in 2015, has 18 today, a drop of 66%. Of them, most lie idle, the fishers say. “Fishing has nosedived here,” says Peter White, 67, who has fished since he left school at 15. “A lot of people have left. From here all the way up the eastern channel as far as Whitstable. Harbours are empty, boats are gone. Fishing is on the floor. These boats haven’t been at sea for a month.” No one is at sea today, due to westerly winds, which worsen the further out you go, he says, and even on a good day, there’s fewer than eight active. These small “under 10” metre boats are the backbone of the UK industry; they represent 79% of the fleet and reportedly provide half of catch-related jobs. But in England between 2008 and 2022, they declined in numbers by 22%, nearly double the 13% fall in larger boats, according to research by Newcastle University and the University of Plymouth published this year. Over the same period, vessels under 10 metres also spent 43% fewer days at sea. The fishers in Hastings who spoke to the Guardian blamed multiple factors for the decline, including marine heatwaves affecting fish populations, unsustainable quotas that dictate what and how much they can fish and larger trawlers further out in the North Sea “hammering” fish stocks. In White’s family, fishing goes back a century. But neither of his two daughters fish, and with most on the Stade in their sixties, he fears he is one of Hasting’s last fishers. “It’s going to die out,” says White. “Fish shops are disappearing right left and centre.” He is semi-retired, but still fishes with his nephew, Darren, 49, on his boat, the RX56, the Sussex Girl. He loves being at sea more than he ever did. “I have a pension and no mortgage to pay, so there is no pressure,” he says. “Most fishermen don’t do it for the money, they do it for the life.” T he Hastings Fishermen’s Protection Society, set up in 1831 to preserve the fishing community’s right to work from the beach, has helped train 10 young people over the past decade. All except one have left for better-paying jobs elsewhere. Shane Ball, 32, whose father is a fisher, left reluctantly in November for a job as a maintenance man. “All I ever wanted to do was fish,” he says. “I skippered for 12 years. “But it came time to get a mortgage. When you go out to sea, you have to pay the fuel and the crew. Sometimes, you are literally burning the diesel for nothing.” Shane Ball out at sea on a 12-hour fishing trip with his father, Robert ‘Podgy’ Ball, on their boat, the Bethan Louise, in 2017 The cost of fuel has rocketed, as have other costs after health and safety rules imposed on the small boats by the Maritime and Coastguard Agency in 2023. In May, the struggling sector was dealt a further blow after a “ Brexit reset ” deal between the European Union and the UK. Fishers condemned the deal as a “betrayal” because it granted large EU vessels 12 years of access to UK territorial waters, right up to where the small boats fish at six miles from the coast, a year before the existing deal was due to expire. Alongside the deal, the government announced a £360m fund to modernise the fleet, boost exports and support communities. Mark Ball, 62, who fishes with his son Jamie, 30, the youngest of the Hastings crew, says earning have plummeted in the past decade. “The only way we can maintain the boat now is if we take it out of savings.” Mike Cohen, the CEO of the National Federation of Fishermen’s Organisations, says the Brexit reset deal “was a big blow” that surrendered the best prospect fishing communities had to grow. “You’ve got our little boats fishing alongside 30m-plus Spanish, French, Portuguese boats and Dutch and Danish in some places too, that can stay at sea in all weathers, fish around the clock and stay at sea for a week or fortnight in weather that our boats can’t get out from port. They can’t compete. “We gave away access to waters and we got absolutely nothing back.” Cohen has called for a national strategy for fishing and marine food production, and to deploy the £360m fishing and coastal growth fund where needed. Last week, scientists from the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea, advised a 77% reduction in fishing of North East Atlantic mackerel to prevent population collapse . Conservationists point to a lack of a unified management plan between countries to prevent overfishing. Catch limits between EU countries and the UK in the region have consistently exceeded limits recommended by scientists. Rob Pearson, chief fisheries and conservation officer for the Sussex Inshore Fisheries and Conservation Authority, argues that good inshore management is one of the reasons England has one of the largest smallscale fleets in Europe , but it is undermined by what is happening farther offshore. The changes in health and safety rules have also had a “massive impact” on recruitment, he says. “The pathway to becoming an inshore fisherman was already a struggle. It’s harder to take a crew because of the safety requirements.” B ack in Hastings, Lucy Phillips, 55, and skipper Paul Stanley, 59, are sorting nets on the deck of the RX11, Christine, on the Stade. Phillips, who worked as a translator before taking up fishing four years ago, says: “It makes me sad it’s declining. “We don’t want to become a toy town, where people leave the boats and it looks like a museum,” she says. Paul Stanley, the skipper, and his partner, Lucy Phillips, with their boat, Christine In the old days, the Stade was “like a big family”, says Kevin Bollen, 64. “Everyone knew everyone else. As kids we used to go and pull the boats off the beach. They would give us a few fish and we went round the houses selling them. When you got to my age, you would be the ‘boy ashore’, help bring the boat in and get a quarter of a share. “This used to be one of the richest fishing grounds in the UK. Now, you’d be really pushing yourself to take £15,000 a year.” Bollen sold his boat after a cancer diagnosis more than a decade ago. “Another 10 years, I don’t think there will be boats out.” Asked what will happen to the Stade when the last fisher leaves, Bollen replies: “It’ll be turned into a car park, won’t it?” Kevin Bollen, right, with the skipper and boat owner, Darren Coglan, in the latter’s shed",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/oct/09/hastings-brexit-sunk-historic-uk-fishing-fleet,Business,BBC,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/36d1b798b9d3ec0870da0e53093b9f70dc257989/263_0_2338_1871/master/2338.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=7bc253de6f9174255d69eb8ba9d29cda",2025-10-09T11:00:22+00:00,717cce3e557783520f97f14e4eae2a10a3f67d6b
8a7394901c47,There’s a £1 idea that could save small music venues. Is Live Nation holding it back?,,"G rassroots venues are the bedrock of the country’s music industry, giving artists a place to hone their craft, and punters a place to see them perform up-close – possibly before a bigger, starrier career. But since the start of 2023, more than 150 of these venues have permanently closed their doors – about 16% of the entire UK sector. In this moment of crisis, a solution is on the table: a proposed £1 levy on tickets for all arena and stadium shows with more than 5,000 capacity could raise up to £25m annually for the grassroots venues facing closure. A poll of about 8,000 music fans found that 93% supported the initiative by the charity Music Venue Trust, and a spokesperson from the Department for Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) says it “fully supports” the rollout. Over the last year, major artists such as Coldplay, Ed Sheeran, Pulp, Diana Ross, Katy Perry and Radiohead have all committed to it, alongside venues such as the Royal Albert Hall and ticketing platform Tixel. Sam Fender’s 2024 arena tour raised more than £100,000 via the levy, which has recently been distributed to 38 independent venues. “The idea that money from shows in big venues supports the smaller venues, where it all starts for musicians like me, is just common sense,” Fender has said. But a huge funding gap remains. For concerts in 2025, more than 22m of 24.2m eligible tickets are sold without the £1 contribution, according to industry data shared with the Guardian. And while the early picture for 2026 shows positive momentum, with uptake rising to 28%, this still translates to millions in missing potential support. “The industry is very good at adding fees where the company adding the fee is the beneficiary, and not quite so efficient when the money is for the wider ecosystem,” says Mark Davyd, chief executive of Music Venue Trust. ‘The idea that money from shows in big venues supports the smaller venues is just common sense’ … Sam Fender. Photograph: Emma McIntyre/Getty Images for Coachella Steve Dix of Hackney venue Paper Dress Vintage backs the levy as an important step in stabilising grassroots venues across the country, and is blunt about what he thinks is its main obstacle. “Some of the big players such as AEG Presents, SJM and Kilimanjaro Live have already stepped up and shown real leadership,” he says, referring to three of the big promoters that arrange arena and stadium gigs. “But the truth is that until the biggest [promoter] in the world, Live Nation, does the same, progress will be held back. Their participation is the missing piece that would turn this from a promising initiative into an industry standard.” According to data presented to the government’s Business and Trade Committee by the Association of Independent Festivals (AIF), Live Nation controls 66% of the UK’s major event ticket market in 2025, either directly or through its subsidiary companies such as Ticketmaster. Back in May, former minister for creative industries, Sir Chris Bryant, called on Live Nation to “step up” regarding levy adoption, and “help in relation to Ticketmaster and … any of the acts they are representing”. Bryant also called on more artists to sign up to the levy, and suggested that the government would act “if this weren’t to be proceeding”, enshrining the £1 levy in law. But Davyd claims a statutory government levy would be a “blunt instrument”, taking years to legislate, with the risk of funds being misdirected. In contrast, he argues the voluntary model “can be delivered very fast, and can be very effectively distributed.” A spokesperson for Salford experimental venue The White Hotel agrees: “As soon as the government gets involved in anything you know they’re just going to make a pig’s ear of it.” (DCMS did not comment on this criticism.) The money is already making a difference on the ground. Fender’s donation, for example, has been distributed via the Liveline Fund – a Music Venue Trust and Save Our Scene initiative – allowing venues such as Paper Dress Vintage to replace a broken mixing desk, Glasgow’s Sub Club to repair their iconic “bodysonic” dancefloor, and providing The White Hotel with “vital” financial support. This fund is a precursor to the Live Trust , a charity established by the wider industry in January 2025 to be the official administrator for the £1 levy, set to begin distributing funds in February 2026. Diana Ross, one of the artists who has contributed to the fund for grassroots venues. Photograph: Jim Dyson/Getty Images When asked whether it would indeed “step up” and add the £1 levy to all of the major concerts it promotes, Live Nation did not directly respond, but affirmed that “supporting new talent is vital to the future of music” and that it was “proud to champion emerging artists and grassroots venues … We support the aims of the grassroots ticket levy, and it’s encouraging to see artists we promote already opting in for their shows.” The £1 levy has its critics. Some argue that the cost should not be passed on to fans, who already face escalating ticket prices. “There has been something of a mixed response,” says Mike Grieve, Sub Club’s managing director, noting a feeling that “major concert promoters are already asking their customers to dig deep to pay for tickets”. However, he says the additional funding is a “massive help” for smaller operators, particularly as razor-thin margins are hampering their ability to book lesser-known or experimental acts. “It has become unsustainable for promoters to take any creative risk,” he adds. Davyd suggests that when a promoter links with a ticketing company to sell tickets, the ticketing company should be asking whether the absence of the £1 levy was a deliberate choice or an accidental omission. But without Live Nation taking the lead, “it’s difficult to see how a statutory levy is avoided”, Davyd claims. “If the market leader in an industry refuses to do what is now government policy, we should expect the government to take different action.”",https://www.theguardian.com/music/2025/oct/09/1-ideasave-small-music-venues-live-nation,Business,BBC,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/320bd2218ccf6b75eb9a8e94253e9470a75886bb/974_0_5703_4562/master/5703.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=8f3ff15648299b39bfc061184c0a6fca",2025-10-09T07:00:19+00:00,add07b529ae7a72535a478e41f8005d79731ee5e

But this week Taylor Swift seems to have made a rare misstep. For decades her fans have watched her grow from a teenage country star to globally recognised billionaire, and she has taken them with her, thanks to her sharp lyrics about growing up, relationships and heartbreak. But it’s not just about the music. She has cultivated a unique connection with her Swifties, dropping clues in her music and content and encouraging them to decode it, explains the Guardian’s deputy music editor, Laura Snapes . And it has paid off. The Eras tour boosted the UK economy by £1bn. So when she released The Life of a Showgirl a week ago, the hype was intense. But something seemed to go wrong. The Guardian’s chief pop and rock critic, Alexis Petridis, gave it a two-star review, and many fans voiced their disappointment. Nor was it just with an underwhelming music release. Suddenly her carefully crafted brand was being attacked, Nosheen Iqbal explains, from her beefs with other artists to the business model of offering extensive bonus content alongside the usual album releases. But is this really about Swift or a stepchange in the music industry?

92da37633d5f,David Lammy rules out charging workers for employment tribunal claims,,"The justice secretary, David Lammy , has ruled out reintroducing charges for employment tribunals after a backlash from unions over the proposals. The Guardian revealed last week that ministers were considering a plan to charge workers a fee to take their bosses to court as part of negotiations in this year’s spending review. Trade unions responded with fury, labelling the idea a “disaster”. The Ministry of Justice declined to rule out implementing the proposal last week, saying only that “decision-making about the department’s spending and fees for the next few years following this summer’s spending review is ongoing”. But in a statement on Wednesday, Lammy, who is also deputy prime minister, said: “It’s a fundamental principle that everyone, no matter their income, should be able to get access to justice to challenge unfair behaviour at work. “It’s not just a basic right, it’s also fundamental to this government’s plan to make work pay. That’s why it will remain free to bring a case to an employment tribunal, ensuring everyone, no matter their means, can stand up for their rights at work.” Making a claim against an employer had been free since the tribunal system was established in the 1960s, until David Cameron’s coalition government introduced charges in 2013. Fees were then scrapped in 2017, after the supreme court ruled they were unlawful , after a case brought by the Unison trade union. Lammy added: “The Tory-Lib Dem coalition government tried to price workers out of justice with tribunal fees. Let me be clear, we will not.” Paul Nowak, secretary general of the TUC, welcomed Lammy’s announcement, saying: “No one should ever be priced out of enforcing their rights at work.” He added: “The Conservatives left the tribunal system and our courts in a mess with huge backlogs. Trade unions are ready to work with the deputy prime minister and other ministers to deliver a system that is fair, accessible and fit for the future. This includes unions helping workers resolve problems in the workplace, not the courts.” Labour’s employment rights bill includes sweeping changes to workers’ rights, which the unions have welcomed, but some business lobby groups have argued will add to the costs of hiring workers. The changes are expected to lead to an increase in tribunal cases. The Conservatives, under the leadership of the then prime minister Rishi Sunak, proposed a £55 fee for workers to make an employment tribunal claim , in plans made void by Keir Starmer’s general election victory. With significant delays and a shortage of qualified judges, the UK’s employment tribunal backlog has ballooned, with a queue of 45,000 single open cases at the end of March. In order to help tackle the backlog, the Ministry of Justice began recruitment for up to 36 employment tribunal judges in March, and it plans to hire another 50 next year.",https://www.theguardian.com/money/2025/oct/08/david-lammy-rules-out-charging-workers-for-employment-tribunal-claims,Business,BBC,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/837b2a1e272c7c0727a57adbdb7c7cf47d1df865/386_0_4207_3367/master/4207.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=74461910c8567906843e177fdf6bd768",2025-10-08T17:05:45+00:00,6d6589220d91afc6d194f571f2f4844e44fb148a

9c9280cd2cce,Ovo pricing change could double charging costs for some EV owners,,"Electric vehicle owners fear they will be left out of pocket after the energy supplier Ovo announced changes to a popular charging deal which could double the cost for some customers. Drivers who have an energy contract with the company can currently charge their vehicles at any time of day or night for 7p a kilowatt hour (kWh), making its Charge Anytime deal the cheapest on the market. From 4 November, however, the cost will soar to 14p a kWh unless they sign up to a new monthly plan, priced from £27.50 for an estimated 700-mile range. The plan also includes a voucher worth about 600 miles for use at public chargers. Ovo says the changes are a “new, easy way of paying”, but customers who drive fewer than 700 miles a month claim they will be left with larger bills. The monthly allowance cannot be carried over and the vouchers are not valid for all public charging providers. To qualify for the deal, drivers must be an Ovo customer, have a compatible EV charger and a smart meter. EV owner Chris Goddard was informed of the changes a week after switching his energy supply to Ovo to make use of the Charge Anytime deal. “It’s an insult,” he said. “One of the things that persuaded me to buy an electric car last month was Ovo’s charging rates. The cheapest monthly payment plan will work out at more than a 100% rise for some.” Customers on Ovo’s forum said the company had “lost the plot” and accused it of misleading them with an email announcing “a great opportunity”. The monthly plans are priced according to average miles rather than kilowatt hours, unlike the current tariff, making it difficult for drivers to compare the costs. A range of energy providers offer pay-as-you-go charging deals for less than 9p a kWh, but the cheap rate only applies to night charging during specified hours. Consumer campaigners are concerned the new tariff will disadvantage drivers with low monthly mileage at a time when the government is seeking to encourage more households to shift to electric vehicles. “Any increase in electricity rates is unwelcome news, particularly at a time when energy prices remain staggeringly high,” said Andrew Capstick, utilities editor at MoneySavingExpert.com. “Ovo’s Charge Anytime tariff was one of only a very few that let you charge your vehicle for cheap at home at any time of the day.” skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Business Today Get set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morning Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Ovo denied that financial constraints had prompted the tariff change. It said they were in response to customer requests for a simplified payment system. “Charge Anytime offers flexibility to charge wherever and whenever EV drivers need, while benefiting from the certainty of a fixed monthly cost,” a spokesperson said. “We know it won’t suit everyone, so we’re waiving exit fees for customers who wish to leave.”",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/oct/08/ovo-pricing-change-could-double-charging-costs-for-some-ev-owners,Business,BBC,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8b0dea997bb938047ea9e894230b2bfee328ade6/222_0_6037_4833/master/6037.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=4bb83606c71bdcac518ed5c7f2275179",2025-10-08T11:52:32+00:00,fdd654c869e7a3e2be797713ce2a12d2c800a918
73bff1352d1d,"Meta AI adviser spreads disinformation about shootings, vaccines and trans people",,"A prominent anti-DEI campaigner appointed by Meta in August as an adviser on AI bias has spent the weeks since his appointment spreading disinformation about shootings, transgender people, vaccines, crime, and protests. Robby Starbuck, 36, of Nashville, was appointed in August as an adviser by Meta – owner of Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, and other tech platforms – in an August lawsuit settlement. Since his appointment, Starbuck has baselessly claimed that individual shooters in the US were motivated by leftist ideology, described faith-based protest groups as communists, and without evidence tied Democratic lawmakers to murders. Starbuck’s online posts have not changed in tenor since the “ anti-DEI agitator ” was brought into the Meta fold, and his Trump administration connections raise broader questions about the extent to which corporate America has capitulated to the Maga movement. The Guardian repeatedly contacted Meta for comment on Starbuck’s role, and his rhetoric online, but received no response. The Guardian also contacted Starbuck via an email address associated with his website. In part, he responded: “It seems your piece is an attempted hit job meant to punish Meta for working with me on AI fairness. Nothing I’ve said has been on behalf of Meta – they work with people from every political background.” He added: “My role is simple: work to make AI fair for everyone, regardless of their views. That’s a goal anyone who believes in fairness should support. What you’re really trying here looks like cancel culture and activism dressed up as journalism, and I won’t cower for holding the same views as the political party that won the popular vote less than a year ago in America.” Heidi Beirich, the co-founder of the Global Project Against Hate and Extremism, said: “It is appalling that Robby Starbuck was given a hand in Meta operations in any capacity. He peddles lies and pushes extremism, and it is hard to believe any of this will help make their platforms safer or better. Eric Bloem, vice-president of corporate citizenship at the Human Rights Campaign Foundation, said: “People should be able to find safe, welcoming communities online. Robby Starbuck pushes a dangerous anti-LGBTQ agenda, spreading disinformation and denying the very existence of transgender people.” Starbuck, formerly a music video director, has gained attention as an opponent of corporate diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs. His pressure campaigns have frequently been directed at companies who are perceived as having conservative customer bases , and have induced major American firms to abandon internal DEI measures, or to end their relationships with pro-LGBTQ organizations like the Human Rights Campaign. Starbuck won his role in the aftermath of one such campaign. In the midst of a summer 2024 campaign aimed at motorcycle manufacturer Harley-Davidson, Starbuck threatened Meta with a lawsuit over claims its Meta AI chatbot apparently made about him. In August 2024, Starbuck posted a screenshot purporting to show Meta AI’s summary of a Facebook thread of Harley riders angry that the “company chose to go woke “. A screenshot in reply from a Harley-Davidson dealer appeared to show Meta AI asserting that Starbuck was, among other things, an adherent of the QAnon conspiracy theory, and had participated in the January 6 attack at the Capitol. Starbuck responded : “Wow thanks for sending, Meta will hear from my lawyers since I was never at J6 and have been a longtime critic of QAnon.” That lawsuit was filed last April. Starbuck’s appointment to work with Meta was part of the settlement . Other details of the settlement – including whether or not Starbuck was paid or is receiving ongoing compensation for the role – were not made public. On 8 August, Meta’s chief of global affairs Joel Kaplan posted on X a joint statement with Starbuck. In part, the statement read: “Since engaging on these important issues with Robby, Meta has made tremendous strides to improve the accuracy of Meta AI and mitigate ideological and political bias.” The statement continued: “Building on that work, Meta and Robby Starbuck will work collaboratively in the coming months to continue to find ways to address issues of ideological and political bias and minimize the risk that the model returns hallucinations in response to user queries.” Bloem said: “There’s nothing unbiased about [Starbuck’s appointment].” He added: “Coupled with its January rollback of protections against hate speech across its platforms, this decision calls into question Meta’s commitment to keeping LGBTQ+ people and others safe online.” ‘Portland is working with the terrorists’ Starbuck has long pushed vaccine disinformation , and he has amplified false claims made by health secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr. In July, he boosted a debunked claim made by Kennedy in an interview with Tucker Carlson, in which he claimed that hepatitis B vaccinations led to a 1,135% increase in autism risk, adding: “This is absolutely criminal. The people behind this belong in jail and the hep B shot should be pulled immediately from the childhood vaccine schedule.” As part of his anti-DEI push, Starbuck has also spread overheated claims and falsehoods about transgender and LGBTQ people. He has also boosted such claims made by members of the Trump administration. In March, boosting a claim Donald Trump made in an address to Congress that the government had spent “$8m for making mice transgender”, Starbuck wrote: “Democrats are trying to pretend that Trump was wrong about the government funding a study to turn mice transgender. He was NOT wrong. This is the study and it’s vile. Eighty female mice were ‘sacrificed’ after their last injection. Democrats funded this.” In fact , the mice studies sought to gauge the effect of hormone therapy on maladies such as wound-healing, HIV, and infertility. Starbuck’s online demeanor has continued largely unchanged since he was appointed, with him backing far-right figures in America and around the world and posting dubious pro-Trump narratives. Starbuck recently expressed support for authoritarians and he posted a video of Stephen Miller’s speech on the Memphis Safe Task Force , which has seen federal officers and national guard troops making arrests in there. Starbuck added the caption: “I’ve been advocating for us to make Memphis safe again for YEARS now by carrying out similar initiatives @nayibbukele executed successfully in El Salvador and finally… It’s happening.” El Salvador president Nayib Bukele, self-styled as the “world’s coolest dictator”, is celebrated by the far right in the US for his unconstitutional crackdown, which has seen up to more than 1.5% of the country’s population imprisoned, almost a quarter of those without trial, according to World Prison Brief . Starbuck also baselessly asserted that city officials in Portland were working with anti-fascists, and appeared to urge a violent response. Starbuck claimed that injuries to rightwing online personality Katie Daviscourt indicated that “the leftist government in Portland is working with the terrorists”, adding: “It’s time to treat Antifa cells like we would treat Isis cells.” In a comment on this allegation, Starbuck wrote: “The record is not in dispute. Portland councillors Angelita Morillo and Candace Avalos both publicly defended an antifa activist charged with assaulting a federal officer. Morillo has even posted tips to help antifa evade law enforcement. “ He added: “When elected officials openly side with violent extremists, they are enabling them.” Morillo told the Guardian: “When influencers like Robby refer to ‘terrorists’, I’m not sure who they’re talking about – the guy in the frog suit? The people doing the Cha-Cha Slide outside the Ice facility in Portland? I can’t take anyone seriously who relies on sensationalized clips, AI content and outright lies to inform their thinking.” Avalos said: “People are free to say what they like on social media. That doesn’t make their statements true, and it doesn’t mean we have to take them at face value. “As a federal judge found in her recent ruling against the administration, the idea that there are coordinated attacks from ‘antifa, and other domestic terrorists’, as Trump alleged on Truth Social, is simply ‘untethered to the facts’. Who should we listen to: a sitting federal judge or someone with a Twitter account?” She added: “When I advise my constituents on how to protect themselves from federal agents acting unlawfully, I am speaking to the vast majority of Portlanders, who rightfully oppose fascism and are certainly not terrorists.” Starbuck also claimed that a high profile Trump detainee who was once incarcerated in Bukele’s brutal Cecot prison that “Kilmar Abrego Garcia [is] almost certainly an MS-13 member”. Two federal judges this year rejected the administration’s claims that Abrego Garcia is a member of MS13, and the government was ordered to facilitate his return from El Salvador. Commenting on his allegation, Starbuck wrote: “This is simple: an immigration court, DHS, and the president of the United States all identified Garcia as an MS-13 member. Denying it is no longer reporting – it’s spin in the pursuit of your own make-believe narrative. So once again, my language was perfectly appropriate.” ‘This is domestic terrorism’ In recent weeks, Starbuck has energetically attempted to connect the alleged perpetrators of high-profile shootings to the Democratic party. These claims culminated in a video posted to X in which he claimed that “in less than 2 weeks there have been 5 domestic terrorism attacks by leftists”, citing the assassination of Charlie Kirk, the armed attack on an ABC affiliate in Sacramento, California; the attack on a wedding reception in Nashua, New Hampshire; and the attack on an Ice facility in Dallas. Another example he offered were purported chants of “Fuck Charlie Kirk!” by leftists in New York in the wake of Kirk’s death. In an earlier post , he cited the same events and claimed: “This is domestic terrorism”. The man accused of the Sacramento ABC attack does have a long history of posting anti-Trump messages on social media, according to prosecutors, and spent two decades as “a lobbyist for healthcare, tribal and labor interests”, according to the New York Times. Evidence for connections between the other perpetrators and the Democratic party, or even the broader left, is either tenuous or non-existent. The claim about chanting demonstrators appears to arise from mid-September videos of counterprotesters who, according to videos taken by independent journalists, disrupted a memorial vigil for Charlie Kirk in New York’s Washington Square. The identities, allegiances, and organizational affiliations of the counterprotesters are unspecified, and few media outlets reported on the story except Russian outlet Pravda. However, Joshua Jahn, who turned his gun on himself after the Dallas Ice attack, was reportedly registered as an independent in Oklahoma, and was described by friends as someone with “a vaguely libertarian bent who despised both major parties and politicians generally, including Trump, but who didn’t engage with politics beyond that”, according to reporting by journalist Ken Klippenstein. Hunter Nadeau, accused of killing one and wounding two others in an attack on a country club in Nashua, New Hampshire, reportedly yelled “Free Palestine” during the attack. But state attorney general John Formella said Nadeau “made a number of statements during the shooting and appeared to be attempting to cause chaos in the moment as opposed to showing a hate-based motivation”, according to NPR . Formella added: “We don’t have any evidence to indicate that this was a hate-based act.” Tyler Robinson, the man accused of Charlie Kirk’s murder, was reportedly registered as a non-partisan voter in Utah , although family members indicated he had moved politically to the left, according to prosecutors. Nevertheless, investigators reportedly told NBC News that “thus far, there is no evidence connecting the suspect with any leftwing groups”. All of the reporting clouding the political allegiances of the shooters was on the public record on 25 September, when Starbuck replied to an X user who challenged him that “every single one of the cases I just pointed out are leftists”, blaming “left wing leaders … and their crazy followers”. Starbuck reiterated his claims about each shooter to the Guardian and linked to four sources he claimed supported him, including a Daily Mail story about Facebook posts by Joshua Jahn’s mother, and a protest footage video published to YouTube by one of the previously cited independent videographers. He further responded with accusations about the Guardian, writing: “Why is the Guardian fixated on trying to downplay leftwing violence instead of investigating the clear surge of it?” He added: “I don’t have the luxury of ignoring this reality – my security team and the FBI are actively handling ongoing death threats against me. The dismissiveness from outlets like yours makes you complicit in emboldening this violence.” The lawsuit that took Starbuck to Meta was carried out by a firm with Trump administration connections. Dhillon Law Group (DLG) filed suit in Delaware on behalf of Starbuck. In a press release , the firm said Meta’s chatbot had made “provably false and defamatory statements” about Starbuck. Between the original posts and the lawsuit, DLG founder Harmeet Dhillon was nominated and confirmed as Donald Trump’s assistant attorney general for civil rights. Trump named her as his pick in December and she was confirmed in April, weeks before Starbuck’s settlement. According to Office of Government Ethics filings, Dhillon divested her ownership in Dhillon Law Group in the firm in favor of her brother, a non-equity partner in the firm. In her 27 February ethics agreement, however, Dhillon wrote that she would “retain an interest in a portion of future recovery in 21 contingency fee cases based upon a fixed percentage of compensation”. The Guardian contacted the justice department to ask whether Starbuck’s case was one of the 21 that Dhillon retained an interest in. Initially, an automated response warned that “during the current lapse in appropriations, this inbox will not be monitored on a regular basis”. A spokesperson subsequently responded in an email, writing: “AAG Dhillon does not currently have any role in cases involving Mr Starbuck and their relationship is one of friendship and former client.” The Guardian then asked whether or not she had a role in his case at the time it was settled in April. The spokesperson said no. The Guardian previously reported that Dhillon earned a six-figure salary as CEO of a nonprofit, the Center for American Liberty (CAL), according to filings from 2021, 2022 and 2023. During that period, Dhillon Law Group received more than $1.3m as a contractor to the organization over two years. Dhillon, several CAL clients and Dhillon Law attorneys also shared the services of the same Republican-aligned PR operative. During Dhillon’s leadership, the CAL pursued a myriad of culture-war lawsuits on behalf of rightwing influencers, “de-transitioners” and parents of transgender children, and churches that had been subject to California’s pandemic restrictions. Beirich, the extremism expert, said: “This is just another example of Meta caving to Trump and his allies, and bogus charges of political bias, and makes a mockery of fair content moderation on Meta’s various platforms.” Elsewhere in his comments to the Guardian, Starbuck wrote: “You should be honest with Guardian readers about the fact that you’ve been accused of extremely close ties with antifa.”",https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/oct/12/meta-ai-adviser-robby-starbuck,Technology,BBC,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5aaa6edfd926c7c8572a9d50752d6894915c1006/381_0_3334_2668/master/3334.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=203035a0f4de04d2531b863d4ff326a0",2025-10-12T12:00:52+00:00,3f693ff8aaf2e1d98f49b4c771d6f51cf34d3239
fbe3b2d74003,Using a swearword in your Google search can stop the AI answer. But should you?,,"Using a swearword in your Google search can stop that annoying AI overview from popping up. Some apps let you switch off their artificial intelligence. You can choose not to use ChatGPT, to avoid AI-enabled software, to refuse to talk to a chatbot. You can ignore Donald Trump posting deepfakes , and dodge anything with Tilly the AI actor in it. As the use of AI spreads, so do concerns about its dangers, and resistance to its ubiquitousness. Dr Kobi Leins – an AI management and governance expert – chooses to opt out when medical practitioners want to use AI. She told a specialist she didn’t want AI transcription software used for her child’s appointment but was told it was necessary because the specialist was “time poor” and if she did not want it used she would need to go somewhere else. “You can’t resist individually. There is also systemic resistance. The push from the industry to use these tools above and beyond where it makes sense [is so strong],” she says. Where is AI? AI is spreading inexorably through digital systems. It’s embedded in applications such as ChatGPT, Google’s AI overview, and Elon Musk’s creation Grok, the super-Nazi chatbot . Smartphones, social media and navigation devices are all using it. It has also infiltrated customer service, the finance system, online dating apps and is being used to assess resumes and job applications, rental applications – even legal cases. It’s increasingly part of the healthcare system , easing the administrative burden on doctors and helping to identify illnesses. A global study from the University of Melbourne released in April found half of Australians use AI on a regular or semi-regular basis, but only 36% trust it. Prof Paul Salmon, the deputy director of the University of the Sunshine Coast’s Centre for Human Factors and Sociotechnical Systems, says it’s getting harder and harder to avoid. “In work contexts, there is often pressure to engage with it,” he says. “You either feel like you’re being left behind – or you’re told you’re being left behind.” Should I avoid using AI? Privacy leakage, discrimination, false or misleading information, malicious use in scams and fraud, loss of human agency, lack of transparency and more are just some of the 1,600 risks in the Massachusetts Institute of Technology’s AI Risk Database . It warns of the risk of AI “pursuing its own goals in conflict with human goals or values” and “possessing dangerous capabilities”. Greg Sadler, the chief executive officer of the Good Ancestors charity and coordinator of Australians for AI Safety, says he often refers to that database and, while AI can be useful, “you definitely don’t want to use AI in the times where you don’t trust its output, or you’re worried about it having the information”. Aside from all those risks, AI has an energy cost. Google’s emissions are up by more than 51% thanks at least in part to the electricity consumption of datacentres that underpin its AI. The International Energy Agency estimates that datacentres’ electricity consumption could double from 2022 levels by 2026, while analysis shows they will be using 4.5% of global energy generation by 2030. How can I avoid using AI? AI overview has a “profanity trigger”. If you ask Google “What is AI?”, its Gemini AI interface will deliver you a potted (and sometimes inaccurate) answer. It’s functioning as an “answer engine” rather than a “search engine”. But if you ask “What the fuck is AI?”, you will be delivered straight search results, linking to other pages. There are various browser extensions that can block AI sites, images and content. You can circumvent some chatbots and speak to a human if you repeatedly say “ speak to a human ”, use the words “urgent” and “emergency”, or, according to this report, “ blancmange ” – a sweet dessert popular throughout Europe. James Jin Kang, a senior lecturer in computer science at RMIT University Vietnam, writes in the Conversation that to live entirely without it means “stepping away from much of modern life”. “Why not just add a kill switch?” he asks. The issue, he says, is that it is so embedded in our lives it is “no longer something we can simply turn off”. “So as AI spreads further into every corner of our lives, we must urgently ask: will we still have the freedom to say no? “The question isn’t whether we can live with AI but whether we will still have the right to live without it before it’s too late the break the spell.” What’s the future of AI? Governments around the world, including in Australia, are struggling to keep up with AI, what it means, what it promises and how to govern it. As big tech companies seek access to material including journalism and books to train AI models, the federal government is under pressure to reveal how it plans to regulate the technology. The Conversation has asked five experts where AI is heading . And three out of five of them say AI does not pose an existential risk. Of those who say it doesn’t, Queensland University of Technology’s Aaron J Snoswell says it is “transformative” and the risk isn’t AI becoming too smart, it is “humans making poor choices about how we build and deploy these tools”. CSIRO’s Sarah Vivienne Bentley agrees it is only as good as its users while the University of Melbourne’s Simon Coghlan says despite the concern and hype there is “little evidence that a superintelligent AI capable of wreaking global devastation is coming any time soon”. Australian Catholic University’s Niusha Shafiabady is more grave. She says today’s systems only have limited capacity, but they are gaining capabilities that make misuse more likely to happen at scale, and that it poses an existential threat. Seyedali Mirjalili, an AI professor from Torrens University Australia, says he is “more concerned humans will use AI to destroy civilisation [through militarisation] than AI doing so autonomously by taking over”. Leins says she uses AI tools where it makes sense, but not everywhere. “I know what it does environmentally and I like to write. I have a PhD, I think through my writing,” she says. “It’s about what is evidence based and makes sense. It’s not getting caught up in the hype, and not getting caught up in the doom. “I think we’re complex and smart enough to hold both ideas at the same time – that these tools can be positive or negative.”",https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/oct/11/using-a-swearword-in-your-google-search-can-stop-the-ai-answer-but-should-you,Technology,BBC,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fd6f8285b6f0afabcf0abaff9eba8e2b82879291/0_628_4372_3498/master/4372.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=29f2c8ce532c29d54319d4b5034e7bf4",2025-10-10T23:00:07+00:00,7b5550343e2fd268aec6e4b7fec60f58279a94a7
10f8a2e8b9f5,"Move over, Alan Turing: meet the working-class hero of Bletchley Park you didn’t see in the movies",,"T his is a story you know, right? It’s early in the war and western Europe has fallen. Only the Channel stands between Britain and the fascist yoke; only Atlantic shipping lanes offer hope of the population continuing to be fed, clothed and armed. But hunting “wolf packs” of Nazi U-boats pick off merchant shipping at will, coordinated by radio instructions the Brits can intercept but can’t read, thanks to the fiendish Enigma encryption machine. Unless something is done – and fast – Hitler’s plan to first bomb, then starve the country will succeed. Enter the genius Alan Turing , working as a codebreaker at the top secret Government Code and Cypher School at Bletchley Park, who, in a generational act of intellectual virtuosity, designs and builds the world’s first computer to crack Enigma, allowing the U-boats to be neutralised and the war ultimately to be won. This is why Turing is known as the father of computing. It’s a great story. But, like a lot of great stories, it couldn’t be more wrong. The world’s first digital electronic computer, forerunner of the ones reshaping our world today, was built in Britain to revolutionise codebreaking during the second world war – a mind-boggling feat of creative innovation – but Turing wasn’t in the country at the time. Neither was it conceived by the mostly private school and Oxbridge-educated boffins at Bletchley Park. Rather, the machine Park staff called Colossus was the brainchild of a degreeless Post Office engineer named Tommy Flowers, a cockney bricklayer’s son who for decades was prevented by the Official Secrets Act from acknowledging his achievement. Now, with his 120th birthday approaching and a Tommy Flowers Foundation established to right this historical wrong, he is finally getting some of his due, starting with a mural by the artist Jimmy C (best known for the David Bowie mural in Brixton, south London) at the National Museum of Computing. Here’s the story you didn’t see in the movies. O n a sun-drenched weekday in August, Bletchley Park is the soul of pleasantness: a stately home flanking a lake codebreakers skated on in winter between battling a constantly evolving phalanx of electromechanical encryption machines used to scramble messages between leaders of the Third Reich. On the right as you face the house is a Lego brick complex of concrete huts – grim-looking, as one female codebreaker noted on arrival, but with an aura you fancy you can still feel. I’ve noticed that visitors tend to speak in hushed tones here, as though wary of distracting the brilliant minds still haunting the place. Stephen Fry once declared, “Just saying the name Bletchley Park gives me goosebumps.” Clearly he is not alone. In the visitors’ centre cafe, one of the Park’s two in-house historians, David Kenyon, explains why the bucolic scene modern visitors encounter needs contextualising. The popular imagining of Bletchley Park (BP) as a determinedly unmilitary scratchpad for eccentric geniuses may have been true in the beginning, he says. But by the end of 1943, when many of the cryptographic breakthroughs had been made, BP was on its way to becoming a codebreaking and intelligence factory underpinning the entire Allied effort. The huts Turing and the cryptographers originally toiled in were now used for minor admin work, while a growing inventory of futuristic codebreaking machines whirred and hummed in a complex of huge lettered blocks built around a communication centre on the far side of the mansion, connected by mechanical conveyors and vacuum tube delivery systems. At peak more than 10,000 people worked here round the clock, in three eight-hour shifts and improbable secrecy. Three-quarters were women, their mean age between 20 and 22. Codebreakers at Bletchley Park in 1943. Photograph: Science Museum Photo Studio/Bletchley Park Trust/Science Museum Group “Substitution cyphers” such as those the Nazis favoured have existed for at least two millennia. The first known use is recorded by Julius Caesar in his book Gallic Wars, where he describes encrypting a message to his besieged general Cicero by substituting Greek letters for Roman ones. One of the most famous cyphers would subsequently be named for him and involve replacing the original letters of a message (the plaintext) with those a certain number of places along in the alphabet. Substitution cyphers present obvious points of attack to an enemy. Being able to guess any of the words, for instance “Heil Hitler” at the end of a message, will offer a way in. Letters that appear often, or rarely, or mostly together in the encrypted cyphertext, reflecting patterns in the original message, can offer a toehold. For two millennia cryptography has been a battle of wits between code makers and breakers. By the time we reached the typewriter-sized Enigma machine, three rotor wheels, like the barrels of a combination lock, were being used to addle plaintext messages. But where the barrels of a combination lock have 10 possible starting positions (0 to 9), these had 26, each corresponding to a letter of the alphabet. And then came the fiendish bit: each letter activated a different substitution alphabet – in one position b might become f, in another q. What’s more, with every plaintext letter typed into the machine, at least one wheel rotates, so changing the substitution alphabet and muddying the patterns on which codebreakers rely. He should be up there with Bill Gates, Steve Jobs, all the great figures of computing. He should have made as much money as they did The British had known about Enigma since 1921, when its manufacturer tried to sell them on it. Dillwyn “Dilly” Knox, a brilliant codebreaker who was said to have been a lover of John Maynard Keynes at Eton and would work closely with Turing at BP, brought one back from Vienna for testing in 1926, when it was found to have small but significant vulnerabilities and rejected. By 1939 and the outbreak of war, a gifted Polish mathematician named Marian Rejewski had broken it “by hand”, with paper and pencil, and with colleagues designed a machine they called Bomba to speed the process. One of Turing’s several acts of genius was to break the more complex naval Enigma machine, before which U-boat wolf packs ran riot in the North Atlantic. Another was designing his own machine, called the Bombe in tribute to his Polish predecessors but vastly more sophisticated than theirs. There’s no way to exaggerate the importance of these contributions. And yet greater challenges lay in wait, leading to a crisis with an outcome no one could have predicted. Enter Tommy Flowers. B y June 1941 most of the work on Enigma was done. That month, however, “Y Service” eavesdroppers at Knockholt in Kent intercepted a Nazi message encrypted in a way they hadn’t seen before. Instead of being transmitted in morse code, like Enigma, this one arrived in teleprinter code, in which each letter was allocated a five-bit binary number. G, for instance, was 01011, equivalent to the decimal number 11. The binary number for each character was then transmitted via rapid pulses and silences – not dissimilar to a 1990s modem. A teleprinter machine took ordinary typewriter-type keyboard input, converted it to a stream of these five-bit binary numbers and transmitted it. An identical machine at the other end printed the message on tickertape, punching a hole to represent a one and leaving a space to represent zero. Each horizontal line on a teletype tape thus represented a specific character. In the middle of the tape was a smaller sprocket hole used to drive it through the machine. The mysterious device was active for 16 months of testing, until October 1942, then vanished. British codebreakers dared hope it had been abandoned. Yet almost immediately it reappeared on a line between Berlin and Salonika in occupied Greece – this time to stay. Soon this ghost machine, which the British would never see during wartime, was scrambling traffic on multiple lines, protecting communications between Hitler, his high command and commanders in the field: material of the highest possible order. In keeping with the British characterisation of intercepted messages as fish, the new machine was nicknamed Tunny, for tuna. Colossus, Flowers’ groundbreaking computer, at Bletchley Park in the 1940s. Photograph: Science History Images/Alamy Known to German high command as the Lorenz SZ40, Tunny was the size of a laser printer and far more sophisticated than Enigma. It attached directly to a teleprinter and made use of not three or four but 12 wheels, each with a different number of positions, ranging from 23 to 61 (all prime numbers). As per Enigma, the operator of the receiving Tunny machine needed to know the starting positions of each wheel: Bletchley codebreakers called these the wheel settings . But the internal configurations of each wheel could also be changed with the use of small pins, effectively rewiring the machine: BP called these the wheel patterns . For a year the Research Section at Bletchley strained against Tunny. At first their only hope of a window into the machine rested with enemy carelessness. When, on 30 August 1941, an operator ignored protocol and sent the same message twice without changing the wheel settings, small errors in the second version allowed a veteran cryptanalyst named John Tiltman to deduce 4,000 characters of decrypted text, then infer the wheel patterns (changed monthly at this time). Yet from this high, codebreakers watched in agony as, months later, Nazi high command tightened security, locking them out all over again. Which is how it stayed for another year, until 25-­year-old postgraduate chemist turned mathematician Bill Tutte, in one of the most remarkable intellectual feats of the war, extended an insight of Turing’s that had allowed wheel patterns to be broken and conceived a formula for uncovering the all-important wheel settings. Enough information for any message to be decrypted. But there was a problem. Applying Tutte’s formula to a Tunny cyphertext by hand would take a century or more per message. Still locked out of Tunny traffic except in increasingly rare instances of operator error, the codebreakers’ agony only increased. T he first intake of codebreakers had been light on mathematicians, who were thought too abstracted and weird to trust. Turing’s breakthroughs helped change this, along with a popularity resting on what colleague Peter Hilton called “his original approach to problems of any kind and his quirky and infectious sense of humour”. One beneficiary of the change was a Cambridge don named Max Newman, who found painstaking pencil-and-paper work dull and was on the brink of returning to university when Tunny drew him back. If you asked Central Casting for a photo of a cerebral academic and they sent you one of Newman, you’d send it back demanding more imagination. There are the round milk bottle glasses; hair battling for headspace with giant brain. In a lecture series in the 1930s, Newman had wondered if intractable maths problems could one day be automated away. He didn’t specify how this would be done, but one of his students – Turing – did, in what is now one of the most famous academic papers ever written, On Computable Numbers. This is the actual reason Turing is “the father of computing”. Alan Turing, who was so impressed with Flowers that he called on him to help codebreak at Bletchley Park. Photograph: Pictures from History/Universal Images Group/Getty Images The machine Newman now designed to execute Tutte’s formula for attacking Tunny wheel settings was by no stretch a computer in the modern sense, but had the benefit of being relatively quick to build. BP staff named it Heath Robinson for its thrown-together look. And it worked, if with substantial problems, not least being its use of two teleprinter tape loops, one containing the binary cyphertext to be attacked and the other Tunny’s already decrypted wheel patterns, which had to be kept perfectly in sync but tended to stretch, wear and snap. It was also slow and not perfectly reliable. When the team building it ran into difficulties, Turing suggested they consult an engineer he’d worked with and been impressed by. That engineer’s name was Tommy Flowers. F lowers was born in 1905 in Poplar, east London, the son of a master bricklayer. At 12 he won a scholarship to the local technical college and went from there to an apprenticeship at the Royal Arsenal in Woolwich, then renowned for precision mechanical engineering. Over four years he learned a range of design and manufacturing skills, yet by the end knew mechanical engineering wasn’t for him. What excited Flowers was electricity . One of the few organisations hiring in the postwar slump of the 20s was the Post Office, then responsible for mail and telecoms and engaged in an ambitious plan to replace their manual phone exchanges with automatic ones. Flowers joined in 1926 and soon built a reputation as an innovative thinker. By the time Turing came calling, he was head of switching research at the Post Office’s Dollis Hill Research Station in north London. There’s less publicly available information on Flowers than almost anyone else in this tale. But over the line from Washington DC, his niece, Bridget Young, now 82, fills in some of the blanks about his life prior to Bletchley Park. Young went to live with her uncle aged 15, after her father and disabled mother – Flowers’ sister, who he was very close to – died in a car crash. This wasn’t the first familial trauma he’d endured: he was only 25 when his father died suddenly of a stroke, leaving him to assume responsibility for his two sisters and mother, there being no pensions or social safety net in those days. Then one night in October 1940, while he was involved in war work at Dollis Hill, he received news that a bomb had fallen on the family home, killing his mother and youngest sister. He had to go and identify their bodies, as he later would Bridget Young’s parents. For him, the fight against Tunny was personal. skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Inside Saturday The only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

She reads me a monograph he wrote in which he laments the inequality of opportunity for working-class children. Going to university never occurred to him. “I had to get a university standard of education by study in my own time without the benefit of actually attending,” he writes. According to Young, Flowers’ sense of his East End roots never left him. In retirement, when he was stuck on a waiting list for a hip replacement, she offered to pay for it to be done privately – not because he couldn’t afford it but because it might spur him to action – and recalls him telling her, “No, ducks, if my number hasn’t come up, it must be because there are people who need it more than me.” It turned out – in the kind of irony a novelist wouldn’t dare try to fly – the health authority computer had randomly dropped him from the list. When I told him there was going to be a book, telling the whole story, he looked interested, but he said, ‘It’s too late’ Working in his lab at Dollis Hill, visiting Bletchley as needed, Flowers improved Newman’s design for Heath Robinson and oversaw its manufacture, but still considered it a poor machine. In response, in February 1943, he stunned the boffins with a plan for a fully electronic digital machine that would use thermionic valves as switches to generate and process the zeroes and ones used for binary calculation. Valves – mostly found in guitar amplifiers and high-end hi-fi systems now – look like small, tubular lightbulbs. In the 1940s most people knew them from radio sets, and they had a reputation for constantly failing. Yet, having pioneered their use in automatic telephone exchanges, Flowers knew that if left switched on they were highly reliable. The idea of using valves as switches in a digital system was so new and radical that Flowers may have been the only person in Britain capable of seeing it – and of knowing they would be millions of times faster than the traditional electromechanical switches Newman used: he had already used them to build a prototype digital memory unit for the Post Office, a truly astonishing first. Nonetheless, Flowers later characterised the response he got at BP as “incredulity”. Nothing like the machine he proposed, using 1,600 valves to perform digital calculations, had ever been contemplated (“What, are you going to throw them at the Germans?” a procurement officer scoffed). Just as mathematicians had been sidelined in favour of genteel denizens of the humanities at first, so building actual things implied “trade”, which tended to be looked down upon. Newman wished him well but pressed on with the utilitarian Heath Robinson. Turing was different, being someone who loved both making and thinking. He was supportive of Flowers and offered advice on the machine’s logic, but couldn’t be around to provide more than this, because he would be in the US, helping to establish a cluster of US-built Bombes to be run as a BP outpost in Washington DC. Flowers at 90, with his rebuilt Colossus. Photograph: Peter Trievnor/Times Newspapers Ltd Flowers went away feeling the Bletchley people hadn’t understood him. Luckily his boss at Dollis Hill did and put the Research Station resources at his disposal. Recruitment of able telephone engineers and “wiremen” from around the country yielded a close-knit team of 50 or so, most in their early 20s. Few could be told the purpose of what they were working on, but the intensity of six-to-seven-day work weeks made clear it was important. At one point a resident barber was hired to minimise the need to leave the building. After 10 months working round the clock, it was done. Colossus weighed a ton and occupied a whole room. Where Heath Robinson used two tapes, Flowers’ machine allowed the Tunny wheel patterns to be programmed into it using plugboards and switches. His original plan was to digitise the Tunny cyphertext being attacked, too, but this was deemed problematic for long messages, so it remained on tape, as rows of holes and spaces representing five-bit binary numbers. The teleprinter tape sprocket holes, conventionally used to drive the tape forward, served to synchronise the whole machine, functioning like the “clock” in a modern computer. Which is what Flowers and his team of young Post Office engineers had built: the world’s first special purpose electronic digital computer. Delivered in a Post Office truck to BP on 18 January, the prototype was assembled by Flowers’ people and worked almost immediately. Its first job, for a cyphertext whose decrypt was known, took 10 minutes. Flowers later marvelled that “when the first machine was constructed and running, they couldn’t believe it”. More were ordered, to be produced in a commandeered Birmingham Post Office factory at a rate of one a month, with the enhanced Colossus II involved in a race to be ready for D-day in June 1944 (though whether it had a specific role in D-day is unclear). Subsequent models included many new features and innovations, with a later example including what one of the Colossus team proudly describes as “a relatively large semi-permanent memory”, equivalent to Ram. By VE Day 10 machines were working round the clock in two giant steel-framed buildings: a codebreaking factory. After the war, Churchill ordered most of the Colossi to be destroyed, with all information about them classified. Two went to GCHQ, where they remained in use until the 1960s. One, or possibly two, were disassembled and, with parts scrubbed of clues to their previous use, went with Newman to Manchester University, to help build the world’s first general purpose computer, soon taken to market as the Ferranti Mark I. Turing went to the National Physical Laboratory in London, where he built the most sophisticated computer of the immediate postwar years, the ACE. Both Newman and Turing have long (and rightly) been considered seminal figures in the annals of computing. No one seems to have guessed they were shown the way by a working-class Post Office engineer. Meanwhile, two years after Flowers delivered Colossus, he was forced to watch the Americans John Mauchly and J Presper Eckert being feted as visionary builders of the first computer, the ENIAC, and enriched accordingly; to see their claim repeated in history books for the next 50 years, unable to say anything in reply. Worse, when he tried to persuade the Post Office to modernise with the technology he pioneered, managers didn’t believe he could make it work and thought him pretentious for suggesting he could. Full details would take another five decades to be declassified. By then, a computer scientist named Tony Sale, fresh from campaigning to save BP from property developers, had begun a rebuild of a Colossus, which now lives at the Bletchley-based National Museum of Computing. After speaking with the historian David Kenyon, I amble round the corner for a treat: not just to see Colossus, but to see it running. In operation it’s majestic, all crisply spooling tape and flashing lights, and surprisingly smooth-running; the kind of conceptual leap the world doesn’t see often. I’ve been lucky to meet a lot of charismatic machines, but few have the kind of presence this one does. Jack Copeland is professor of philosophy at the University of Canterbury, Christchurch, and director of the Turing Archive for the History of Computing. Any article or discussion of Turing or Colossus owes a huge debt to his work and this one is no exception. If anyone is well placed to provide perspective on Flowers’ life and achievements, he is. “Of course, Tommy couldn’t have patented anything he’d done,” he tells me over Zoom. “He should be up there with Bill Gates and Steve Jobs and all the rest of them, one of the great figures of the history of computing. He should have made as much money as they did, certainly as much as Eckert and Mauchly did.” Copeland met and interviewed Flowers before he died in 1998, just as a new tranche of material relating to Tunny and Colossus was being released. How was the engineer feeling about his deferred recognition? “You know, I think he was over it by then. I remember one day bouncing in, full of the joys of spring, saying, ‘Hey, there’s going to be a book’” – the monumental Colossus: The Secrets of Bletchley Park’s Codebreaking Computers , which Copeland edited – “‘and it’s going to tell the whole story.’ He just sort of … looked interested, but he said, ‘It’s too late. It’s much too late.’” Bridget Young is pleased her beloved uncle got to see his achievements acknowledged finally, even if most people still think Turing built Colossus. But she recalls someone who was mostly happy; who in retirement was still acquiring ambitions and enthusiasms, from painting to playing bassoon in an orchestra. “You know, I have three kids and my older son was always fascinated by Uncle. He used to get a magazine called Cricket and somebody wrote an article about the first computer, the ENIAC computer. So Daniel, who must have been about seven, wrote them a letter saying, ‘No, they weren’t the first, my uncle was!’ And Cricket printed the letter, so I sent a copy to Uncle, saying, ‘Look, you’ve got somebody standing up for you.’ And Uncle wrote Daniel this wonderful letter, in which he thanked him for defending him, then said, ‘You know, when a new discovery is about to be made, it’s usually happening in several places at the same time, because different developments, in different disciplines, are all making different moves forward, until enough is known that a new step is needed. It’s never just one person in one place.’ I think for him the reward was what he and the others all did together.”",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/oct/12/move-over-alan-turing-meet-the-working-class-hero-of-bletchley-park-you-didnt-see-in-the-movies,Technology,BBC,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/be03d3aae08dcd8a008883f19fa0f12ba7b4a761/190_419_2988_2390/master/2988.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=91714e017df42c1c75c34eb5ef20b4e6",2025-10-12T11:00:50+00:00,370745e43d150459f89ead1a54e02c5fd83ff322
ba2b90113083,Inside tech billionaire Peter Thiel’s off-the-record lectures about the antichrist,,"Peter Thiel , the billionaire political svengali and tech investor, is worried about the antichrist. It could be the US. It could be Greta Thunberg . Over the past month, Thiel has hosted a series of four lectures on the downtown waterfront of San Francisco philosophizing about who the antichrist could be and warning that Armageddon is coming. Thiel, who describes himself as a “small-o orthodox Christian”, believes the harbinger of the end of the world could already be in our midst and that things such as international agencies, environmentalism and guardrails on technology could quicken its rise. It is a remarkable discursion that reveals the preoccupations of one of the most influential people in Silicon Valley and the US. “A basic definition of the antichrist: some people think of it as a type of very bad person. Sometimes it’s used more generally as a spiritual descriptor of the forces of evil,” Thiel said, kicking off his first lecture. “What I will focus on is the most common and most dramatic interpretation of antichrist: an evil king or tyrant or anti-messiah who appears in the end times.” Timeline Peter Thiel's lectures on the antichrist, summarized Show Peter Thiel divided his four lectures on the antichrist under loose banners of subject matter. After listening to recordings of his off-the-record talks, the Guardian has summarized each lecture by synthesizing them into a format easier to follow than his meandering musings. The timeline below consists of the title of each lecture, the question Thiel is attempting to answer within it, and the conclusion he comes to, accompanied by representative quotes. 15 September 2025 Lecture 1: “Knowledge shall be increased” Question: What is the antichrist’s relationship to Armageddon? Answer: The antichrist, whom Thiel believes is some sort of evil tyrant, will come to power by constantly talking about the existential threats of technology and science to the world. They will use this prognostication to gain some type of unifying global power and force the complete stagnation of technological and scientific progress which he says is already stagnant. Quote: “The antichrist comes to power by talking constantly about Armageddon, about rumours of wars and scaring you into giving him control over science and technology,"" said Thiel. ""We have sort of an answer in late modernity, which is that the antichrist will come to power by talking about Armageddon non-stop. Matthew 24:6: ‘You shall hear of wars and rumours of wars.’ If you think of it not in the timelessly eternal but in the one-time world historical way, it's sequence. The rumors come after the wars or they're escalations from the wars. In some ways, we got the answer already in Los Alamos,” he said. 22 September 2025 Lecture 2: “Empire and the antichrist’s relation to government” Question: What kinds of government are antichrist-like in nature? Quote: “Last time I talked about Daniel 12:4 – ’knowledge shall be increased in the end times.’ Tonight I will explore the other half of this prophecy, that ‘many shall run to and fro,’ which I read, much like Francis Bacon did, as a prophecy about globalization, empire, and the dangers of a one-world state,” Thiel said. Answer: There are several forms of either anti-science, pro-science, anti-Christian or pro-Christian governments represented in literature that show the various forms that an antichrist-like government can take. These dynamics change throughout modern history. He zeros in on four books: Francis Bacon’s New Atlantis, Jonathan Swift’s Gulliver’s Travels, Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons’s Watchmen, and Eiichiro Oda’s manga One Piece, which embody various stances in favor of or against science and Christianity. Quote: “You can at least identify the antichrist in literature. I'm going to try to illustrate this change in history through these four books,” said Thiel. 29 September 2025 Lecture 3: “How one person can take over the world and the velocity at which that person has to move to do so” Question: How can the antichrist, a single mortal person, achieve world domination? Answer: They can do it if they’re young – or – get rich young, since “money has this remarkable velocity”. Quote: “Tonight, I’ll continue this investigation by asking the seemingly narrow question of the velocity of the antichrist. What I mean by that is: the Bible says that one man will take over the entire world. He only has one lifetime to do that. How on earth can he achieve that?” 6 October 2025 Lecture 4: “The new Rome” Question: Where today might we find the antichrist's new Roman Empire? Answer: According to the Bible, the Roman Empire served as the katechon , or the place that will restrain an antichrist figure, and provided law and order, which in turn prevented or delayed the coming of the apocalypse. Thiel says the modern-day katechon is likely in America. One possibility is San Francisco, partly because of its distance from Washington DC, which would make it harder for there to be a fusion of too many powers like the federal government and the technology industry. Ironically, though, he says America is also likely the place with the most markings of a future one-world order. Quote: ""It's just that America is, at this point, the natural candidate for katechon and antichrist, ground zero of the one-world state, ground zero of the resistance to the one-world state.” Thiel was on the forefront of conservative politics long before the rest of Silicon Valley took a rightward turn with Donald Trump ’s second term as president. He’s had close ties to Trump for nearly a decade, is credited with catapulting JD Vance into the office of vice-president, and is bankrolling Republicans’ 2026 midterm campaigns. Making his early fortune as a co-founder of PayPal, he has personally contributed to Facebook as its first outside investor, as well as to SpaceX, OpenAI and more through his investment firm, Founders Fund. Palantir , which he co-founded, has won government contracts worth billions to create software for the Pentagon, US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) and the National Health Service in the UK. Now, with more attention and political pull than ever, the billionaire is looking to spread his message about the antichrist, though he is better known for his savvy politics and investments than his contributions to theology. “I’m a libertarian, or a classical liberal, who deviates in one minor detail, where I’m worried about the antichrist,” Thiel said during his third lecture. The meandering gospel of Peter Thiel’s talks, which began on 15 September and ended on Monday, were long and sweeping, mingling biblical passages, recent history and philosophy and sometimes deviating into conspiracy theories. He peppered them with references to video games and TV shows along with musings on JRR Tolkien’s The Lord of the Rings. He likewise recalled conversations with Elon Musk and Benjamin Netanyahu and spoke at length about how he thinks Bill Gates is “a very, very awful person”. Tickets for the series went for $200, selling out within hours. Attenders were told that the lectures were strictly off the record and that they were forbidden from taking photos, videos or audio recordings. At least one person who took notes and published them had his ticket revoked by a post on X . Guardian reporters did not attend the lectures or agree to the off-the-record stipulation. Recordings were provided by an attender who gave them on the condition of anonymity. When reached for comment, Thiel’s spokesperson, Jeremiah Hall, did not dispute the veracity of the material given to the Guardian. Hall did correct a piece of the Guardian’s transcription and clarified an argument made by Thiel about Jews and the antichrist. The Silicon Valley heavyweight drew on a wide swath of religious thinkers, including the French-American theorist René Girard, whom Thiel knew at Stanford University, and the Nazi jurist Carl Schmitt, whose work he said helped create the core of his own beliefs. He credited the English Catholic theologian John Henry Newman as the inspiration for his four-part series, saying: “Newman did four, so I’m doing four. I’m happy about it.” The venture capitalist has hosted and attended events and lectured on the topic for decades, going back to the 1990s, according to a report by Wired . In recent months, he has spoken to theologians and podcasters about the antichrist both publicly and in private. His beliefs are diffuse, meandering and often confusing, but one tenet he’s steadfastly maintained over the years is that the unification of the world under one global state is essentially identical to the antichrist. In his talks, he uses the term “antichrist” almost interchangeably with “one-world state”. “One world or not, in a sense is the same as the question antichrist or Armageddon. So in one sense, it’s completely the same question,” he said. His version of history, and its potential end, posits technology as a central driver of societal change and takes a Christianity-focused, Eurocentric view that declines to engage much with other religious movements or parts of the world. On the day of Thiel’s final lecture in San Francisco , as the mostly young and mostly male crowd lined up to get in, a group of about 20 protesters stood out front holding anti-Palantir and anti-Ice signs that said things such as “Predatory tech”, “We do not profit from people who profit from misery” and “Not today Satan”. People protesting outside a Peter Thiel event in San Francisco. Photograph: Dara Kerr/The Guardian A trio of self-described “satanists” dressed in black costumes with goth makeup walked up and down the line of attenders carrying a goblet of red liquid with a small plastic replica of a bone. “Will you bring our dark lord Peter Thiel this baby’s blood?” they asked. Then they performed what they called a “dark ritual”, dancing slowly in a circle to Mozart’s Requiem in D minor, which ended with them writhing on the city sidewalk, and yelling: “Take us to your personal hell … Thank you for being our dark lord.” What do Thiel’s lectures say? The Guardian is publishing substantial quoted passages alongside contextual annotations so that the public may be informed on what an influential figure in politics and technology was saying behind closed doors. He believes the Armageddon will be ushered in by an antichrist-type figure who cultivates a fear of existential threats such as climate change, AI and nuclear war to amass inordinate power. The idea is this figure will convince people to do everything they can to avoid something like a third world war, including accepting a one-world order charged with protecting everyone from the apocalypse that implements a complete restriction of technological progress. In his mind, this is already happening. Thiel said that international financial bodies, which make it more difficult for people to shelter their wealth in tax havens, are one sign the antichrist may be amassing power and hastening Armageddon, saying: “It’s become quite difficult to hide one’s money.” It’s because the antichrist talks about Armageddon non stop. We’re all scared to death that we’re sleepwalking into Armageddon. And then because we know world war three will be an unjust war, that pushes us. We’re going hard towards peace at any price. What I worry about in that sort of situation is you don’t think too hard about the details of the peace and it becomes much more likely that you get an unjust peace. This is, by the way, the slogan of the antichrist: 1 Thessalonians 5:3. It’s peace and safety, sort of the unjust peace. Let me conclude on this choice of antichrist or Armageddon. And again, in some ways the stagnation and the existential risks are complementary, not contradictory. The existential risk pushes us towards stagnation and distracts us from it. How does Thiel think Armageddon will happen? Thiel rarely gives a definitive answer about who exactly the antichrist might be or how Armageddon might come about – a central point across his lectures is that nothing is written in stone or inevitable – but he does give the contours of what a global conflict that could lead to Armageddon might look like. There’s all sorts of different ways, one world or none, antichrist or Armageddon, that I’m tempted to think about this, and here’s one sort of application. In terms of how does one think about the current geopolitical moment. How does one think about the nature of the conflict between the United States and China, the west and China. You don’t really know how it’s going to go. You can ask, are we heading for world war three or cold war two? And if you sort of reflect on the history of the two world wars and the first cold war. But first, if there ever was an unjust war, world war one is an unjust war. If there ever was a just war, world war two was probably a just war, with certain caveats. World war one is really insane. World war two was about as justified as a war can be. I think we can say that if you had an all -out world war three or war between nuclear powers involving nuclear weapons, it would simply be an unjust war. A total catastrophe, possibly literal Armageddon, the end of the world. So world war three will be an unjust war. But then if you have a cold war, you have to distinguish between – can you have a just peace and an unjust peace? Somehow, it’s very strange how the first cold war from ‘49 to ‘89 ended. But it ended with roughly what I think of as a just peace, where somehow you didn’t have a nuclear war. And somehow our side, which I think was more the good side, basically won. And you ended up not with a perfect peace, but more or less a just peace. And so if we have world war three, it will be an unjust war. If we have cold war two, maybe it can end in a just peace or an unjust peace. Reflecting on this material and thinking about it, it’s obviously not written in stone and there’s a lot of different ways this stuff can go. But I keep thinking that, if you had to put odds on it, aren’t the odds that we’re trending towards the fourth quadrant this time. The fourth possibility that cold war two will end an unjust peace. Thiel devotes a large section of his second lecture to a quote from the Book of Daniel that involves a prophecy about the end times, which he equates to modern advances in technology and globalization. Let’s go on to ‘many shall run to and fro and knowledge shall be increased.’ It means science progressing, technology improving, globalization, people traveling around the world. Of course in some sense, I think these things … I’m not sure they’re completely inevitable, but there is some direction to it. Where there’s a linear progression of knowledge and something like globalization that happens. But of course, the details matter a lot. Knowledge increasing, science progressing, technology improving can be a very good thing. No disease, death, protect people from natural disasters. Then, of course, we can destroy ourselves with nuclear weapons, bioweapons, etc. And similarly, globalization is … you have trade in goods and services. There’s certain ways to escape from tyrannical governments. And of course there is danger in the one -world state of the antichrist. As the antichrist is synonymous with a one-world state for Thiel, he also believes that international bodies including the United Nations and the international criminal court (ICC) hasten the coming of Armageddon. Throughout his lectures, he warns of what he sees as the danger of these bodies and the harms they have already caused. In the following quotes, he’s lamenting the actions of the ICC: They’ve started arresting more and more people. Rodrigo Duterte , the former president of the Philippines, was arrested this year. They had arrest warrants out for Netanyahu and Gallant. When I met Netanyahu early in 2024, about a year and a half ago, we talked about what he’s doing in Gaza, and the one-liner he had was: ‘I can’t just Dresdenize Gaza – you can’t just firebomb them.’ So it’s like, come on, ‘I’m less of a war criminal than Winston Churchill. Why am I in so much trouble?’ During a Q&A portion of one of the lectures, an attender asked specifically about Thiel’s thoughts on abolishing the ICC, saying: “If we get rid of the ICC or other organizations that exist to bring, in theory, justice, how can we right crimes? Should we not have prosecuted Nazi criminals?” Thiel responded: I think there was certainly a lot of different perspectives on what should be done with the Nuremberg trials. It was sort of the US that pushed for the Nuremberg trials. The Soviet Union just wanted to have show trials. I think Churchill just wanted summary executions of 50,000 top Nazis without a trial. And I don’t like the Soviet approach, but I wonder if the Churchill one would have actually been healthier than the American one. Who could be Thiel’s antichrist? Thiel believes that the antichrist would be a single evil tyrant. He mentions several figures he believes are particularly dangerous and, while he never definitively says who the antichrist is, he makes suggestions about how some people could be antichrist-type figures. A basic definition of the antichrist. Some people think of it as a type of very bad person. Sometimes it’s used more generally as a spiritual descriptor of the forces of evil. What I will focus on is the most common and most dramatic interpretation of antichrist: an evil king or tyrant or anti- messiah who appears in the end times. Specifically, he suggests the antichrist would be a “luddite who wants to stop all science”, referencing Thunberg, Eliezer Yudkowsky, and Marc Andreessen. My thesis is that in the 17th, 18th century, the antichrist would have been a Dr Strange love, a scientist who did all this sort of evil crazy science. In the 21st century, the antichrist is a luddite who wants to stop all science. It’s someone like Greta or Eliezer. It’s not Andreessen, by the way. I think Andreessen is not the antichrist. Because you know, the antichrist is popular. I’m trying to say some good things about Andreessen here, come on. During a question-and-answer session, Thiel was asked to respond to a quote from fellow investor Andreessen – a name he audibly bristled at. He said Andreessen was engaged in hyperbole and “gobbledygook propaganda” when it comes to the promises of AI. Where should I start? I’m tempted to be triggered in some nasty ad hominem argument, but I can’t resist so I’ll do that. I don’t know, this is just pure Silicon Valley gobbledygook propaganda. I wouldn’t give someone who said things like that too much money to invest. Later, he returns to these “legionnaires of the antichrist”. In late modernity, where science has become scary and apocalyptic, and the legionnaires of the antichrist like Eliezer Yudkowsky, Nick Bostrom and Greta Thunberg argue for world government to stop science, the antichrist has somehow become anti-science. Gates, the philanthropist and co-founder of Microsoft, is high on the list of people Thiel does not like. One of my friends was telling me that I should not pass up on the opportunity to tell those people in San Francisco that Bill Gates is the antichrist. I will concede that he is certainly a Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde-type character. The public Mr Rogers, the neighborhood character. I saw the Mr Hyde version about a year ago, where it was just a non stop, Tourette’s, yelling swear words, almost incomprehensible what was going on. Ultimately, Thiel concedes Gates cannot be the antichrist, bringing up the topic more than once: He’s not a political leader, he’s not broadly popular, and again, perhaps to Gates’s credit, he’s still stuck in the 18th century alongside people like Richard Dawkins who believe that science and atheism are compatible. I don’t think even someone like Bill Gates, who I think is a very, very awful person, is remotely able to be the antichrist. Pope Benedict XVI is someone who Thiel admired because he was one of the few popes who referenced the possibility of an antichrist: The tl;dr: my belief is that Benedict literally thought that the historic falling away from the church during his papacy was a sign of the end times. However, Thiel said Benedict failed at spreading the message of the antichrist because he “was not very courageous”. I often like to say libertarianism and marijuana are both gateway drugs to alt-right, other ideas. The danger of the red pill is you move on the black pill. And somehow Benedict overdosed on red pills. Musk, a longtime friend and ally of Thiel, came up during one of the lectures in the context of the Giving Pledge , a pact Gates founded in 2010 where billionaires pledged to donate the majority of their money to philanthropy. Here is Thiel recapping the conversation: If I had to pick a little bit on Elon – and I’m going to pick on him because I think of him as one of the smarter, more thoughtful people … This is a conversation I had with him a few months ago, and it was like: ‘I want you to unsign that silly Giving Pledge you signed back in 2012, where you promised to give away half your money. You have, like, $400bn . Yes, you gave $200m to Mr Trump, but $200bn – if you’re not careful – is going to left wing non-profits that will be chosen by Bill Gates.’ And then I – one step ahead – rethought it and said: ‘ You don’t think about this much because you don’t expect to die anytime soon, but you’re 54 years old. I looked up the actuarial tables: at 54, you have a 0.7% chance of dying in the next year. And 0.7% of $200bn is $1.4bn – about seven times what you gave to Trump. So Mr Gates is effectively expecting $1.4bn from you in the next year.’ And to his credit, Elon was , well, pretty fluid on it. He said : ‘Actually, I think the odds of me dying are higher than 70 basis points.’ A shocking explosion of self-awareness. Then: ‘What am I supposed to do – give it to my children? I certainly can’t give it to my trans daughter; that would be bad. You know, it would be much worse to give it to Bill Gates.’ When asked about the slain far-right commentator Charlie Kirk ’s memorial in reference to the role of Christianity in American politics, Thiel initially demurred saying it was “above his pay grade”. When further prompted, he described what he saw as two versions of Christianity on display at the event: I think, um – what to say – I was thinking about, you know, I had the chart: the katechon pagan Christianity versus the eschaton – the Christianity of Constantine versus that of Mother Teresa. We had an illustration of that with Kirk’s wife saying that she forgave the murderers because that’s what Christ would do. This was an incredibly saintly form of Christianity. And then, you know, President Trump – I don’t know , I forget the language exactly – but, you know, Charlie was into forgiving, being nice to his enemies. He doesn’t believe in being nice to his enemies; he wants to hurt his enemies. And that’s sort of the pagan Christian view. And the problem – the naive view – is: there has to be something somewhere in between, right? But how do you concretize that? What’s the thing that’s in between Mother Teresa and Constantine – between forgiving the murderer and delighting in punishing your enemies? Perhaps, I don’t know, perhaps the in-between thing I thought was that maybe Trump and Elon were able to forgive each other. Thiel argues that, in order for the antichrist to be able to pull off the Armageddon in one lifetime, they need to be young today – he points to 33 as an auspicious number. In these quotes, he draws parallels to powerful figures who died at the age of 33, including Jesus, Buddha and some literary characters: skip past newsletter promotion after newsletter promotion Christ only lived to age 33 and became history’s greatest man. The antichrist has to somehow outdo this. I don’t want to be way too literal on the 33 number – I’d rather stress the antichrist will be a youthful conqueror; maybe in our gerontocracy, 66 is the new 33. But something like these numbers do occur almost mystically through a number of different contexts. Buddha begins his travels at age 30 and experiences Nirvana, ego death, at age 33. But I had to be ecumenical and say something nice about Islam. One idea that’s pretty cool is, when you’re reborn into your afterlife, you’re born into your 33-year-old self. Your 33-year-old self is your best self. Livy’s – the Roman historian’s 33rd chapter of the 33rd book – it announces this 33-year-old conqueror. It’s like Alexander at the peak of his power. Or even in Tolkien, the hobbits have a coming-of-age ceremony at 33. That’s how old Frodo is when he inherits the ring. By the same token, people who are older cannot be Thiel’s antichrist. Here Thiel gives some examples: Trajan, a Roman emperor, wept when he reached the Persian Gulf in AD 115 at the age of 65. He’s too old to beat Alexander the Great’s achievements in India. He died two years later. Hitler is 50 by the time world war two starts – he mimetically loses to Napoleon, who’s only 30 when he became first consul of the French Republic. That goes on to the same problem for a seventy something Xi Jinping. Racist, sexist, nationalist, maybe the second coming of Hitler. But not even the second coming of Genghis Khan. Past the sell-by date. He frequently oscillates between talking about the antichrist and the katechon – a term very briefly used in the Bible that refers to something holding back the coming of the antichrist. In one example, he describes a post-cold war shift to embracing neoliberalism and bureaucracy as an example of antichrist-like government. Of course, you have all these examples where it’s one toggle switch from katechon to the antichristic thing. Claudius to Nero, Charlemagne to Napoleon, anti-communism after the Berlin Wall comes down, it gets replaced by neoliberalism. Which is, you know, the Bush 41 new world order, which you can think of as anti-communism where there’s no communists left. Or Christian democracy, which is sort of the European form of the katechontic, transnational anti-communism. Once the communists are gone, it sort of decays into the Brussels bureaucracy. All kinds of different riffs one could do with this. Or to go even further, if something is not powerful enough to potentially become the antichrist, it probably isn’t that good as a katechon. In his last lecture, Thiel also responds during the Q&A portion to a question about potential 2028 presidential candidates and whether they are antichrist or katechon. When asked about Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez , Thiel says that he worries about there being a “woke American pope”– Pope Leo XIV – and a “woke American president”, creating a “Caesar-Papist fusion”. He goes on to talk about Ocasio-Cortez in relation to Thunberg: One of the ways these things always get reported is, I denounce Greta as an antichrist. And I want to be very clear: Greta is, I mean she’s maybe sort of a type or a shadow of an antichrist of a sort that would be tempting. But I don’t want to flatter her too much. So with Greta, you shouldn’t take her as the antichrist for sure. With AOC, you can choose whether or not you want to believe this disclaimer that I just gave. What does he say about Trump and politics? Thiel is asked several times about Trump and how he fits into his imagination of what form Armageddon might take. In one instance, he is asked whether Trump’s opposition to global governance makes Thiel feel any relief about the hastening of a one-world order. At the very best, you shouldn’t have even the most fanatical Trump supporter. You know, no politician, not even Reagan, will solve all problems for all time. Maybe we both were sort of delusional about Reagan in the 80s. There was some moment in the 1980s when we thought that Reagan had permanently solved the deepest problems in the world for all time. And that’s too high a bar. That was too high a bar for Reagan. That’s an unfairly high bar you’re giving to Mr Trump. You’re just trying to make a subtle anti-Trump argument and I’m not going to let you do that. One of Thiel’s longstanding political affiliations has been anti-communism, and in his fourth lecture, he suggests that opposition to communism following the second world war is something that held back the antichrist. At other times, he is critical of post-cold war presidents and government order. I always sort of wonder what functions as the katechon in the world after 1945. This is Schmitt’s 1947 diary. ‘I believe in the katechons, for me the only possible way to understand Christian history and find it meaningful. The katechon needs to be named for every epoch for the past 1948 years.’ The way I interpret this is that sotto voce, Schmitt is saying he has no idea what the katechon is. And maybe, the New Dealers are running the whole planet. Then of course, 1949 the Soviets get the bomb, and my sort of provisional answer is that the katechon for 40 years, from ’49 to ’89, is anti-communism. Which is in some ways is somewhat violent, not purely Christian but very, very powerful. I’ve argued that the katechon, or something like this, is necessary but not sufficient. And I want to finish by stressing where one goes wrong with it. If we forget its essential role, which is to restrain the antichrist, the antichrist might even present himself or itself or herself as the katechon, or hijack the katechon. This is almost a memetic version. A similarity between the antichrist and the katechon, they’re both sort of political figures. The katechon is tied in with empire and politics. If the antichrist is going to take over the world, you need something very powerful to stop it. Thiel also opines on modern-day Russia and offers his views on Vladimir Putin: In some sense, there are perhaps two candidates for the successors to Rome. For all sorts of reasons, I don’t particularly like the Russian theories of all these ways where you have Putin describing himself as the katechon and the last Christian leader in the world. It’s hard to look into someone’s heart. I always suspect he’s more of a KGB agent than a Christian. And then, of course, to be a katechon, you have to be strong enough to possibly become the antichrist. And Russia is not nearly powerful enough to take over the world. It cannot simply be the katechon or the new Rome. Thiel also comments on the relation between Jewish people and the antichrist. He argued against medieval theologians’ idea that the antichrist would be Jewish. There’s probably a lot I can say about the relation of the Jews to the antichrist. The philo-semitic rebuttal, just to get it on the table, is that the Jews in the Bible are described as a stubborn and stiff -necked people. Which is mostly a bug, but maybe in the end times, it is a feature because – this is sort of the way [Vladimir] Solovyov phrased it – that they’re too stubborn to accept Christ, they will be too stubborn to be char med by the antichrist. And so, they become the center of resistance to the antichrist in the Solovyov narrative. In response, Thiel’s spokesperson said: “Peter was arguing against medieval, antisemitic theologians who suggested that the antichrist will be Jewish,” citing Solovyov. Thiel’s final lecture dedicates a large portion of its time to talking about empires and what role the US government plays in holding back or advancing the antichrist. He is characteristically noncommittal, describing the country as having characteristics of a one-world government and also being outside it: Now this is not meant to be an anti-British or anti-American lecture. It’s just that America is, at this point, the natural candidate for katechon and antichrist, ground zero of the one -world state, ground zero of the resistance to the one - world state. The US world police is the one truly sovereign country. They always say the president is the mayor of the US and the dictator of the world. International law gets defined by the US. That’s sort of Nato’s prime, to see in some ways, coordination of the world’s intelligence agencies. Then of course, the global financial architecture we discussed is not really run by shadowy international organizations, it’s basically American. And perhaps always a very important feature is the reserve currency status of the dollar, where it’s sort of the backstop for all the money. The petro dollar regime, there’s sort of crazy ways you have trade deficits, current account deficits, but then in all these ways, the money gets recycled into the US. Then of course, there’s sort of a way where from a certain perspective, the US is also the place that’s the most outside the world state. In many ways, it’s probably one of the best tax havens, at least if you’re not a US citizen. And then there are all these ways the US is a kind of ideological superpower. Christian, ultra-Christian, anti-Christian sense, woke Protestant liberation theology, social gospel, social justice. City on a hill, this institution serves as a beacon of light for other nations and honor. At another point in his final lecture, he seems to suggest that when things are codified or formalized they tend to lose their power or ability to operate. He selects Guantánamo Bay detention camp as an example: By 2005 in Guant ánamo, you were way better off as a Muslim terrorist in Guant ánamo, the liberal lawyers had taken it over by 2005, than as a suspected cop killer in Manhattan. In Manhattan if you were a suspected cop killer back in 2005, you know, there was some informal process they had for dealing with you. Guant ánamo, it was formalized. Initially, they did some bad things and then very quickly, they weren’t able to do anything, any more. And this is again a sort of revelatory unraveling process. During the Q&A section, Peter Robinson talks about John Henry Newman’s description of the antichrist promising people things like civil liberty and equality. “He offers you baits to tempt you,” Robinson said, quoting Newman. Then, Robinson says to Thiel: “The antichrist is a really cool, glamorous hip operator. Is that Zohran Mamdani?” Thiel doesn’t directly answer the question, but does offer his take on the young, progressive mayoral candidate: I don’t think Mamdani can be president because he’s not a natural -born citizen. So he’s capped out at mayor. I also don’t think he’s really promised to reduce my taxes. In his final lecture, Thiel was asked to comment on various potential 2028 presidential candidates and whether they’d be more of an antichrist figure or a katechon. Thiel says he is “very pro-JD Vance”. But he has some concerns about his allegiance to the pope. “The place that I would worry about is that he’s too close to the pope. And so we have all these reports of fights between him and the pope. I hope there are a lot more. It’s the Caesar-Papist fusion that I always worry about. By the way, I’ve given him this feedback over time. And you know with the sort of … I don’t like his popeism, but there’s sort of a way if I steel manned it. It’s always, you have to think about whether if you say you’re doing something good, whether it’s a command, a standard or a limit, or whether in philosophical language, is it necessary or sufficient. And so when JD Vance said that he was praying for Pope Francis’s health, it’s as a command, as a necessary thing. OK, that’s … if you’re a lot more if you’re a good Catholic. But what I hope it really means is that it’s sufficient, and that he’s setting a good example for conservative Catholics like you, Peter, who listen to the pope too much. And perhaps all you have to do to be a really good Catholic is pray for the pope. You don’t really need to listen to him on anything else. And if that’s what JD Vance is doing, that’s really good. I’m worried about the Caesar-Papist fusion. Thiel also spoke about San Francisco and his views on Gavin Newsom, the California governor. ​​I would say that if we go to the katechontic thing and the US is that, tech and politics are radically separate, Silicon Valley is really, really separate from DC in an extreme way. If these things could be fused, … someone like that perhaps represents a way to do that. That’s the part where, if there was a way to … you know, he was the governor of California, he was the mayor of San Francisco. In a way, San Francisco is more important than California. The world city is more important than just this sort of silly province called California. And if you could fuse Washington and San Francisco, that’s a very dangerous thing. It’s kind of, it’s sort of in a way the last precedent where such a fusion of sorts happened. I think it was FDR with New York and D C. So that’s the piece that would be tricky. And you know, by the way, these things have been very, very unfused historically. Back in 2008, one of my liberal friends was trying to get 75 tech-type people to endorse Obama and they got like 68, 69 and thought maybe they could get me. I told them, man, if there are only six or seven, you want to be in the minority. It’s more valuable to be one of the seven than one of the 68. And then his counterpoint was, well, you know, we need to all get on board with Obama because he’s going to win and then we’ll have an influence. And then, the really crazy … and then in a way, Obama … if you think about the primary in 2008, the Democratic primary, Obama had the students, the minorities, the young people. Hillary was the finance world in New York, the unions. Hollywood was sort of split 50/50 between Obama and Hillary. But Silicon Valley was the one sector of the economy that went all in for Obama. But it didn’t work at all. And then if you fast forward to the Obama cabinet, there were zero people from Silicon Valley. There was no representation at all. And so, even Obama was very far from anything resembling a fusion. And then the question is whether Newsom will be like that or different. Why is he fixated on stagnation? Chief among Thiel’s concerns about how quickly the world is hurtling toward an Armageddon is what he describes as a stagnation or slowing down of technological and scientific progress. He attributes part of that to the use of science and technology – once largely seen as a force for good, in his telling – for harm. The creation of the gun and the machine gun “wounded our faith in science and tech”, he said. “And then the atom bomb somehow blew it up entirely. And in some sense in 1945, science and tech became apocalyptic. It left us with a question.” This fear of tech is what the antichrist will seize on to gain power, he says. During the Q&A portion of the first lecture, Thiel is asked about how artificial intelligence (AI) – the much-hyped darling of his fellow Silicon Valley investors – fits into this larger narrative of technological stagnation. Thiel said AI was a symptom of the larger tech stagnation and that people including Andreessen needed to boost its promises because there’s nothing else going on. If we’re going to not have this sort of crazed corporate utopianism versus effective altruist luddism, luddite thing. If you try to have some more nuanced version of this, you try to quantify it. How big is the AI revolution? How much is it going to add to GDP? Add to living standards? Things like that. My placeholder is, it’s looking probably on roughly the scale of the internet from 1990 to the late 90s. Maybe it can add 1% a year to GDP. There are big error bars around that. And I think the internet was quite significant. People talked about the internet in very similar terms in 1999. That’s another way where it sounds like roughly the right scale. The place where it’s very different, where it feels both true of the internet and maybe it’s true of AI, maybe a place where I would agree with Andreessen. The negative part of the statement is: ‘But for AI, nothing else is going on.’ He’s not talking about going to Mars, so it doesn’t sound like he believes Elon’s about to go to Mars. I think there’s a negative part, if AI was not happening, wow, we are really stuck. Things are really stagnant. And maybe that’s why people have to be so excited about this one specific vector of technological progress. Because outside of that, to a first approximation, things are totally, totally stagnant. Maybe even the internet has run out of steam but for AI. So that’s another framing. Now, the thing that strikes me is very different from ’99, if I had to give a difference, again I’m too anchored and rooted in the late 90s. But the late 90s, it was broadly optimistic. And there were a lot of people who thought about it just like Andreessen does. Nobody feels that personally. You can’t start a dot com company from your basement in Sacramento. You can’t start an AI company, you have to do it in San Francisco. You have to do it in Silicon Valley. It has to be at an enormous scale. Most things aren’t big enough. And then there are layers and layers and layers where it feels incredibly non-inclusive. Maybe people just updated from the internet because maybe the internet turned out to have a lot of winner-take-all dynamics. In one of the lectures, Thiel plays a video of a 60 Minutes segment about a German law that cracks down on online hate speech. He’s trying to show an example of where tech regulation goes too far – hence giving power to the antichrist: This kind of video is ridiculous but, of course, indicative of this larger trend. There is this crazy judge in Brazil who is arresting everybody. Australia has more or less ended internet anonymity with age verification required for all social media. The UK is arresting 30 people a day for offensive speech. I’m sort of always in favor of maximal free speech, but my one concrete test is whether I can talk about the antichrist. If I can’t, that’s too restrictive. In his fourth lecture, he also suggests that his beliefs about the end of the world informed his own work in tech at companies such as PayPal: I was working at PayPal at the time trying to build the technology to evade these policies of the world’s powers and principalities. So it was natural to think about the antichrist in the context of the world of financial architecture. I’ll still defend PayPal as more good than bad. References to pop culture and literature Thiel peppered his lectures with references to pop culture, calling out YouTube influencers like MrBeast and throwing out terms like “libtard” – a rightwing slur for people with progressive political views. Sometimes these references pertained to the antichrist; at other times, Thiel was just giving his views on politics, modern society and Silicon Valley, like here: The Succession TV show about the Murdochs is unthinkably retro in Silicon Valley. Only a 20th -century media company could be handed off to someone’s children. If you think about the tech companies, I don’t know, would anybody name a company after themselves? The last tech person who did this was, I think, Dell in the mid-1980s. This is like if you’re a retro Republican from Texas. It is so unthinkable to do this. In his second lecture, Thiel also explores the idea of the antichrist through four works of literature – Francis Bacon’s New Atlantis, Jonathan Swift’s Gulliver’s Travels, Alan Moore’s Watchmen graphic novel and Eiichiro Oda’s manga series One Piece. Thiel states that identifying the antichrist is possibly “hard to do in the present and always sort of controversial”, but that “you at least identify the antichrist in literature”. He describes the plot of Watchmen, a 1986 graphic novel involving superheroes grappling with moral questions about humanity against the backdrop of impending nuclear war: The antihero Ozymandias, the antichrist-type figure, is sort of an early-modern person. He believes this will be a timeless and eternal solution – eternal world peace. Moore is sort of a late-modern. In early modernity, you have ideal solutions, ‘perfect’ solutions to calculus. In late modernity, things are sort of probabilistic. And at some point, he asks Dr Manhattan whether the world government is going to last. And he says that ‘nothing lasts forever.’ So you embrace the antichrist and it still doesn’t work. Thiel later finds biblical meaning in the manga One Piece, discussing how he believes it represents a future where an antichrist-like one-world government has repressed science. He believes that the hero, Monkey D Luffy, represents a Christlike figure. In One Piece, you are set in a fantasy world, again sort of an alternate earth, but it’s 800 years into the reign of this one -world state. Which, as the story unfolds, gradually gets darker and darker. You sort of realize, in my interpretation, who runs the world and it’s something like the antichrist. There’s Luffy, a pirate who wears a red straw hat, sort of like Christ’s crown of thorns. And then towards the end of the story, transforms into a figure who resembles Christ in Revelation. Thiel, along with a researcher and writer at Thiel Capital, explored these ideas at greater length in an essay for the religious journal First Things earlier this month. Do Thiel’s arguments make sense? In a word, no. For one representative example, look to his muddled, contradictory summation of who the antichrist may be: There is a way to think that the antichrist represents the end of philosophy – culmination, termination. He is the individual who gets rid of all individuals; the philosopher who ends all philosophers; the Caesar who ends all rulers; the person who understands all secrets. How is this possible in late modernity, where we don’t believe a philosopher-king, tyrant or ruler can come to power?",https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/10/peter-thiel-lectures-antichrist,Technology,BBC,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ca6295169f228e981cc470f19c6acc9ffe527b2b/0_0_5000_4000/master/5000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=7854f9fbc8e62af4e758a9abac461f06",2025-10-10T15:24:26+00:00,21b7c86b7325253dd4879a046504925d3c174c65
c63826747d45,‘I realised I’d been ChatGPT-ed into bed’: how ‘Chatfishing’ made finding love on dating apps even weirder,,"S tanding outside the pub, 36-year-old business owner Rachel took a final tug on her vape and steeled herself to meet the man she’d spent the last three weeks opening up to. They’d matched on the dating app Hinge and built a rapport that quickly became something deeper. “From the beginning he was asking very open-ended questions, and that felt refreshing,” says Rachel. One early message from her match read: “I’ve been reading a bit about attachment styles lately, it’s helped me to understand myself better – and the type of partner I should be looking for. Have you ever looked at yours? Do you know your attachment style?” “It was like he was genuinely trying to get to know me on a deeper level. The questions felt a lot more thoughtful than the usual, ‘How’s your day going?’” she says. Soon, Rachel and her match were speaking daily, their conversations running the gamut from the ridiculous (favourite memes, ketchup v mayonnaise) to the sublime (expectations in love, childhood traumas). Often they’d have late-night exchanges that left her staring at her phone long after she should have been asleep. “They were like things that you read in self-help books – really personal conversations about who we are and what we want for our lives,” she says. Which is why the man who greeted her inside the pub – polite, pleasant but oddly flat – felt like a stranger. Gone was the quickfire wit and playful rhythm she’d come to expect from their exchanges. Over pints he stumbled through small talk, checked his phone a little too often, and seemed to wilt under the pressure of her questions. “I felt like I was sitting opposite someone I’d never even spoken to,” she says. “I tried to have the same sort of conversation as we’d been having online, but it was like, ‘Knock, knock, is anyone home?’ – like he knew basically nothing about me. That’s when I suspected he’d been using AI.” Rachel gave her date the benefit of the doubt. “I thought maybe he was nervous,” she says. But she’d been “Chatfished” before, so when the gap between his real and digital selves failed to close on their second date, she called it off. “I’d already been ChatGPT-ed into bed at least once. I didn’t want it to happen again.” W here once daters were duped by soft-focus photos and borrowed chat-up lines, now they’re seduced by ChatGPT-polished banter and AI-generated charm. Dating app fatigue is nothing new; for all its promise of convenience and unlimited choices, the gamified nature of finding love in the app age has, over the years, left many users feeling disposable. And, as AI becomes an ever more present feature of modern life – embedded into everything from healthcare systems to online grocery shopping – it’s adding yet another layer of digital artifice to the search for love. In a landscape where text-based communication plays an outsized role in the search for love, it’s perhaps understandable that some of us reach for AI’s helping hand – not everyone gives good text. Some Chatfishers, though, go to greater extremes, outsourcing entire conversations to ChatGPT, leaving their match in a dystopian hall of mirrors: believing they’re building a genuine connection with another human being when in reality they’re opening up to an algorithm trained to reflect their desires back to them. The majority of Chatfishers say they would never dream of letting AI do all of their talking. Most are like 38-year-old Londoner Nick, who sees it as a tool to help foster stronger connections with app matches. He works in tech and lives with his girlfriend; they’re in an open relationship and both date other people casually. He sometimes uses ChatGPT in his conversations on the dating apps Feeld and Bumble. “If I’m using a dating app,” he says, “I want to start a conversation that feels meaningful from the beginning so I can hook the other person in – but also I don’t want to spend too much time on it. Equally, while I want it to be ‘meaningful’, I don’t necessarily want to get super heavy and emotional straight away – it feels like quite a balancing act.” ChatGPT, he says, helps him tread that fine line: offering enough charm to spark a connection, without the investment of time or emotional labour that might otherwise feel wasted if the match fizzles out after a handful of messages. I’m mostly me on the dating app – just maybe asking better questions For Nick, ChatGPT isn’t helpful “if I have a good connection with someone and the conversation is flowing – because what’s the point in using it then?” If, on the other hand, he’s matched with a person “and things are stalling, maybe the conversation has gotten a bit boring but the person is really hot or intriguing, then I might say, ‘Please find a good, engaging, funny answer to this to keep the conversation going.’” He never copies entire answers – “ChatGPT formulates things in a very obvious way,” he says – but he takes inspiration, or uses certain lines and phrases that sound most like him. Still, he admits there’s a subtle slippage when you start filtering yourself through a bot. “It might have generated some things I wouldn’t say or aren’t 100% me, but I went with them anyway. So, in that respect it probably has influenced what someone thinks about me,” he says. “But I don’t think it’s dishonest. I’m mostly me on the dating app – just maybe asking better questions.” For the past three months, 28-year-old social worker Holly from Kent has been navigating a “situationship” with a co-worker. Though they knew each other from the office, they initially started speaking via LinkedIn. Now, they see each other sporadically – “I wouldn’t call them dates,” Holly deadpans – but speak often via WhatsApp. “I mainly use AI because I tend to write really long messages,” she says, “so I’ll put them into ChatGPT and say, ‘Please make this softer and more clear’, or, ‘I need to sound harsher here so he understands I’m upset.’” She doesn’t feel that it’s misleading – “I’m not trying to manipulate anyone,” she says. Her story perhaps speaks to the fact that relationship dynamics have shifted in recent years. According to a 2024 YouGov poll , for instance, around half of Americans aged 18-34 reported having been, like Holly, in a situationship (a term it defines as “a romantic connection that exists in a gray area, neither strictly platonic nor officially a committed relationship”). At the same time, few of us have developed the communication skills to navigate the emotional grey areas thrown up by less stable relationship boundaries. For Holly, having her messages reshaped by AI means she can strike the right balance between honesty and tact: “Sometimes it helps me sound kinder when I’m angry.” Still, she says she would never tell her situationship that she uses AI to help her message him – “and I guess maybe he sees me as less reactive and more understanding because of how my messages are.” As 32-year-old Rich points out, though, “it’s not like using ChatGPT guarantees success”. When he met someone in a bar one Friday night and swapped social media handles, he asked AI what his next move should be. ChatGPT discerned that sending an initial message on Monday midmorning would set the right pace. “Then it gave me some options for what the message could be,” says Rich. “Keep it light, warm, and low-stakes so it reads as genuine interest without urgency,” the bot advised. “Something like: Hey Sarah, still laughing about [tiny shared moment/reference if you’ve got one] – good to meet you!” Rich went back and forth with ChatGPT until he felt they’d hit upon exactly the right message (“Hey Sarah, it was lovely to meet you”) but sadly she never replied, he says. “It’s been two weeks now.” When it’s obvious, the polish of ChatGPT can have the opposite effect to the intended. “I lose interest quickly,” says 35-year-old Nina, who works as an editor for a Serbian language website in Manchester. She was recently on the receiving end of an AI-generated opening line: “Your smile is effortlessly captivating”. “No one talks like that,” she says. She didn’t bother replying. She’s been single for three years and uses Hinge and Bumble. She has turned to AI herself to help improve her profiles: “It basically told me to sound more confident and positive,” she says. “I’ve also asked it for help with opening lines, especially when I didn’t know what to say. Once or twice I thought my matches were using it on me, too – their replies felt too polished, like they weren’t really listening. It’s helpful in some ways but it does make me wonder what’s real.” I thought she was fit so I wanted to keep the momentum going Jamil, 25, from Leicester, admits he’s a prolific Chatfisher but argues that AI is simply a workaround for what he sees as the coded jargon of modern dating. “Like, what do you mean ‘What’s my attachment style?’” he balks. “Every girl on the apps has this thing about ‘love languages’ – it’s just gibberish, but if you don’t talk about it, people are like, ‘Oh you’re a red flag.’” At first, he turned to ChatGPT in desperation. “It was just a quick thing,” he says. He works on an IT help desk and found himself trying to continue a conversation with a girl he wanted to impress while also swamped with work. “I asked ChatGPT what ‘avoidant style attachment’ meant because a girl was saying she’d been told this was her, and it explained, then added this prompt at the end like, ‘Do you want me to craft a reply?’ So I said yeah. I felt out of my depth and was also just really busy that day. I thought she was fit so I wanted to keep the momentum going.” The reply – “I think mine is ‘clingy but with snacks’, so maybe we’ll balance each other out” – proved effective. “She sent a few skull emojis, meaning she was dying laughing. I said I’d have to message her later because of work, and she replied asking if I wanted to meet – so yeah, it was, like, ‘Wow, this works.’” Francesca, 33, owns a digital marketing agency in Cardiff. Like Jamil, she explains that ChatGPT grants her access to a world of inferences and subtext that she’d otherwise find impossible to navigate. “As an autistic woman in an era where the only way to meet anyone is through dating apps, I have struggled immensely. I found understanding tone and ‘the rules’ impossible and so ChatGPT has been really useful,” she says. When she started using it in a dating context it was more as a digital sounding board – an impartial presence that could give her feedback on her profile and offer a debrief after a date. “I pasted all the Hinge prompts [the questions users fill in on their profile] into ChatGPT and said, ‘Knowing what you know of me, choose the best prompts and write a good answer,’” she says. The bot replied: “Based on everything I know about you – creative, self-aware, emotionally intelligent … I’d recommend choosing one of the following Hinge prompts ….” She didn’t copy them exactly, Francesca says, but it gave her a lot of inspiration. Regardless, it still felt like her because the bot was taking what it knew about her from their daily exchanges – “AI is integrated into many parts of my business,” she says – and compressing it into the concise, playful language appropriate for a dating app. “It wasn’t writing me a new personality.” Oh ChatGPT was right, he did want to see me again It wasn’t until she’d matched with a man whom she found difficult to read that she began to deploy ChatGPT for messaging. “Our messages before we met had been really good [without any help from AI] but in person, he wasn’t very flirty or forward and didn’t try to kiss me at the end of our first date. I thought either he didn’t really fancy me or he was just trying to be respectful,” she says. She took screenshots of their last few exchanges, fed the messages and a short account of the date – a blustery walk around a lake – into ChatGPT, and asked it to read the room for her. The reply, helpfully clinical, suggested he was probably being respectful rather than uninterested, and recommended a light, open-ended follow-up. She sent a version of the suggested message, he replied enthusiastically, and they arranged a second date. “I was like, ‘Oh ChatGPT was right, he did want to see me again.’” After that she found herself checking with the bot between every message, and requesting five variations before choosing the one that sounded most like her. “Over the course of a week, I realised I was relying on it quite a lot,” she says. “And I was like, you know what, that’s fine – why not outsource my love life to ChatGPT?” ‘I didn’t know how to talk to this person as myself any more.’ Photograph: Getty Images/ iStockphoto By the time they’d been on their third date, though, “I was using ChatGPT for our entire communication,” says Francesca. “I wasn’t even replying any more – he was basically just dating ChatGPT.” In person, their dates still lacked spark. “I was very aware that I’d taken it too far but I felt like I was in too deep by that point. I didn’t know how to get out of it, I didn’t know how to talk to this person as myself any more.” skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Inside Saturday The only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

On Discord, a chat platform popular with gamers and tech communities, he came across channels dedicated to AI where other single men were exchanging tips about how to prompt ChatGPT to generate effective dating messages. “So, for instance, someone said that if you start a chat with a girl by asking her a list of questions – favourite film, dream holiday, that kind of thing – then paste her answers into ChatGPT, it would craft replies that would make you sound like her perfect match.” It proved effective. “It got me a lot more dates than I was getting before.” I felt bad – I think that was the only time I thought it was kind of dishonest Chat GPT is a large language model (LMM), and the way LLMs work is by spotting patterns in language – the bot was picking up on keywords and themes in his match’s answers and weaving them into jokes, compliments or echoes of shared interests. Where Jamil might have left an awkward “nice” or “cool”, the bot would spin his match’s love of Bali into a playful, if somewhat unimaginative, line about coconut cocktails. It made him seem, at the very least, attentive. Jamil says he doesn’t feel he tricked anyone, he sees it more as hacking the apps themselves. “Dating apps put everyone at a disadvantage – you’re competing with hundreds of other people for attention, and half the time the chats die after two or three messages. If ChatGPT helps me stand out, why wouldn’t I use it?” Still, there was one date that pricked his conscience. He was doing the usual copy-and-paste, letting ChatGPT do the heavy lifting, “when a girl started talking about how she’d had a bereavement in her family”. ChatGPT navigated her grief with composure, synthesising the kind of sympathy that made Jamil seem like a model of emotional literacy. “It said something like, ‘I’m so sorry you’re going through this, it must be really difficult – thank you for trusting me with it,’” Jamil recalls. When he met the girl in real life, she noted how supportive he’d been in his messages. “I felt bad – I think that was the only time I thought it was kind of dishonest. I didn’t tell her I’d used ChatGPT but I really tried to message her myself after that.” Recently he says he’s been caught out more often. “I’ll get people saying point blank, ‘This sounds bait’, even if I’m not just copy-and-pasting. More people are using AI now so they can spot it. I think the golden age of just letting it do all your messaging has passed.” Francesca had a wake-up call when a simple mistake nearly gave the game away. She pasted a wry message scripted by ChatGPT into her WhatsApp chat with a date, only to realise it ended with the telltale bot prompt: “Do you want me to make this punchier?” It wasn’t until his baffled reply – “What do you mean?” – that she realised her mistake. “I just thought, Oh God, I’ve been caught,” she says. She left his question unanswered for a few hours, until deciding the only option was to style it out by pretending that part was meant for a co-worker. “We went on one more date afterwards but I wasn’t sure if he was interested in me or not, so I just let it go. I thought, ‘I’m not up for having to analyse every interaction to see if he’s into me.’ And anyway, by that point, 90% of the messages he’d had off me had been by ChatGPT so it wasn’t like we’d properly gotten to know each other – he was basically dating the AI.” For Paul C Brunson , dating guru and one of the experts currently guiding contestants on Married at First Sight UK, there’s a clear line between using AI as a tool and actively lying. “AI is amazing and it has the potential to help a lot of people – of course it depends on the degree to which someone is relying on it and the purpose behind why they’re using it. For many, it’s simply an enhancement that will allow them to connect with others more easily.” For him, the ultimate dating advice will always be to meet your matches as soon as possible. “It’s the best way to determine if you’re a viable match – you get to observe their behaviour and see if they seem trustworthy. You know, were they consistent in their word? Did they show up when they said they would? Did you feel like you were physically attracted to them? How was the communication when you were sitting opposite them? AI doesn’t impact any of that – AI is the tool to help facilitate the meetup.” Equally, though, he says that most of us know that “fully misrepresenting who you are – lying, basically,” has no place in modern dating. “And I think the vast majority of people would know when they’ve crossed that line.” The problem, as Rachel sees it, is that some people will cross that line deliberately. “Before the advent of AI, it was like, OK, maybe you don’t look like your pictures,” she says, “and that’s annoying but you’d quickly be caught out. Now though, people are putting forward entirely new personas.” She describes being on the receiving end of the kinds of techniques that Jamil uses – being drilled with questions, “like you’re answering an HR questionnaire”, then off the back of those answers “having conversations where it feels as if the other person has a tap on my phone because everything they say is so perfectly suited to me”. The worst, she says, was the time she matched with a handsome man. “It’s an awful generalisation – but I thought he would be all looks and no substance,” she admits. It was a pleasant surprise, then, when their digital conversation flowed easily and she realised they had a lot in common. “I thought I’d found the perfect man. At one point, I talked about how much I loved going on walks and he was like, ‘I know this place with amazing lavender fields, I’m going to take you there.’ I mean, I was used to dating people who didn’t even get me a card on my birthday – and this man was offering to take me to lavender fields? I felt he was really listening to me.” When you’re looking for love and someone says the right things, you aren’t thinking, ‘He must be a bot’ Their date went well, carried on a tide of high spirits from days of intense messaging. “We got pretty intoxicated and did sleep together – I was just swept away by it all,” she says. After that date, though, the messages changed – the flowing sentences filled with questions and quips, the bullet-point lists of books she might like and places they should visit, were replaced by terse one-word replies, sent after long delays. She showed the conversation to a friend, who was the first person to point out that many of his messages bore the hallmarks of having been generated by ChatGPT. She’d never used AI and so wasn’t on the lookout for the distinctive cadences and long dashes. “Maybe I was naive, but when you’re looking for love and someone comes along who says the right things, seems to be on the same page as you, you aren’t thinking, ‘He must be a bot’, you’re thinking you’ve just stumbled across Prince Charming.” I f ghosting was the defining hazard of early app dating, Chatfishing may be its AI-age successor. The rise of ChatGPT in our romantic lives might simply be a symptom of burnout: after years of swiping and stilted exchanges, who wouldn’t be tempted by a digital dating coach, promising wit on tap? Dating apps encourage us to treat romance like a market, full of infinite choice, where we are products to be optimised. AI simply extends that logic – and if the right line, the right cadence, can buy us a little more attention, why wouldn’t we use it? But the secrecy around it is revealing. That so many daters are hiding their reliance on AI suggests that deep down we all know that true intimacy demands vulnerability. Having a chatbot mediate our flirtations – even just in the early stages – risks dimming that intangible spark that only arises in unscripted moments. Worse still, as Rachel’s lavender-field disappointment shows, the drive for more matches, quicker, can leave others feeling used, misled, even doubting what’s real. And dating is perhaps just a test case; as AI seeps further into every corner of our lives, the temptation to neaten the messiness, to smooth the hesitations and flaws that make us human, will surely grow. What happens when no exchange is person-to-person any more? When we’re all talking into echo chambers, hearing our own words reflected back at us? Ultimately, there is no shortcut to connection. “Dating apps are kind of mislabelled,” says Brunson. “They should more appropriately be called ‘introduction apps’, because they’re really only designed to introduce you to potential matches. The rest needs to be done in person – that’s where you find if you have chemistry. And no algorithm can do that part for us.”",https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2025/oct/12/chatgpt-ed-into-bed-chatfishing-on-dating-apps,Technology,BBC,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c7262e1f3c0626fd7c668a0e1da32b1963f0d61e/448_782_2513_2011/master/2513.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=9c2159a64648224be4c4e4478fadc5b3",2025-10-12T05:00:44+00:00,a5a8ff9c330cdf2aa2849afb8b90d1221cb40d3a
a6df3326e329,Do you really need to buy a new laptop? When to upgrade – and when to hold off,,"S o you want a new laptop. Of course you do. Everybody always does, except for perhaps during that short honeymoon period after you’ve just bought one. But the glamour wears off, technology marches on, and before you know it, a newer, younger, more powerful model is wandering into your thoughts. I’m not here to judge, but as a technology specialist I can share a few thoughts that might help you fight the urge to upgrade. Let’s start with the basics: the No 1 reason not to buy a new laptop is that you don’t need one. We’ve grown accustomed to living in an age where technology gets faster every time you turn around, but the jobs we’re actually doing on our laptops are evolving at a much more timid pace. Many of us spend 99% of our computing time using just a handful of apps – a web browser, a conferencing app, a word processor, and possibly a spreadsheet or presentation app. If you’re looking for a new laptop because you’re having to do all of the above on a lousy screen, or with a clunky keyboard, then you might have a point – we’ll come to that later on. But if your head is being turned by faster processors and bigger SSDs , hold fire: do you really think you’ll get your reports written any faster because you’re typing them on a Core Ultra 5 processor rather than an old i3? Worry about your own productivity before scapegoating the poor computer. Outdated connectors aren’t an excuse either. Your laptop may not have the latest USB ports or wifi hardware, but the wonderful thing about modern standards is that they’re stupendously backward- and forward-compatible. You don’t need a new laptop to pair with your sparkly new wifi 7 router – the wifi 5 card in your current one will work just fine (although a Windows update will still take ages). And any USB peripheral can be plugged into any USB port, dating all the way back to 1996 – as long as you have the right cable or adaptor. Save money – and the environment Laptops feature a lot of environmentally costly materials. Photograph: Bloomberg/Getty Images Let’s also acknowledge that not buying a new laptop saves you money. A grand or more for a high-spec model is a lot to spend, but if you tell yourself it’s a long-term investment it somehow feels justifiable. But this doesn’t mean the money can’t be better spent elsewhere. If you’re looking at replacing your laptop because there’s something wrong with it, you might be able to save money by getting it repaired. Sadly it’s not always feasible, largely thanks to the trend towards factory-sealed devices and soldered-in components, but do look into it, as a busted laptop can sometimes be restored to a quasi-pristine state for a third of the price of buying a new one. Another reason you might hesitate to decommission your existing laptop is that it takes a lot of environmentally costly materials to build a new one, and there’s a further ecological cost in safely disposing of your old one. Finally, once you do plonk a shiny new laptop down on your desk, you will probably spend the following days and weeks hunting down all the different bits of software and drivers that you need to reinstall, and working through endless settings and preferences to get the thing working the way you like – which is to say, the way you already had your old one working. How to get the best out of your existing laptop Hardware upgrades can give your laptop a new lease of life. Photograph: baona/Getty Images/iStockphoto If you do decide to give your laptop another chance, there are things you can do to make your working relationship more harmonious. If you’re irritated by endless pop-ups and performance jitters, it’s always a good idea to audit the items that open on startup and turn off any that don’t seem necessary. Windows works perfectly well without any third-party software firing up automatically at startup. All that extra stuff added in there by pushy apps and overzealous laptop manufacturers – that can all go, and your life will be better for it. Even if you’re on a Mac, it never hurts to check your login items and see what you can do without. The same goes for browser extensions, which tend to accrete to the point where every page you open is covered in smart content and analytical toolbars. As well as getting in your way, each one consumes resources and contributes to that sense of general malaise that afflicts laptops of a certain age. Ditch ’em. If you’re using Chrome, enter chrome://extensions into the address bar and smash Remove on anything that isn’t earning its keep; in Microsoft Edge, the address is – guess what? – edge://extensions. On Safari, open the Settings window, and select Extensions to view and manage your plug-ins. And while you’re having a clearout, I recommend spring cleaning your storage too. There are lots of neat free tools that will perform a wholesale audit of your hard disk and show you exactly what’s taking up the space. My personal favourites are WinDirStat on Windows and Disk Inventory X on the Mac; whichever you pick, I’ll bet you’ll be shocked by the amount of space you’re wasting on old downloads and unneeded apps. Purging them probably won’t make your computer run any faster, but if you were thinking of buying a new laptop just because this one was nearly full, that urge may now be quelled. Alternatively, you could give your laptop a new lease of life by treating it to a hardware upgrade or two. As with repairs, this isn’t always possible, but it’s worth exploring whether you can add extra memory, extend the storage or replace the battery. Expanding the RAM, in particular, can make a remarkable difference to the overall feel of a computer. The latest operating systems and applications tend to high-handedly assume that you have at least 8GB of RAM and prefer twice that much; disappoint them and they may embark upon a go-slow in protest. skip past newsletter promotion Get the best shopping advice from the Filter team straight to your inbox.

Photograph: d3sign/Getty Images Beyond all that, you can always engage the nuclear option – a complete wipe and reinstall. There’s no need to muck about with dozens of floppy disks as in days of yore: you can now download and reinstall the OS files over the internet, on Windows and macOS. This makes it a tantalisingly easy way to restore the spring to a computer’s step, but bear in mind that the process will put your computer back into the same naive, unpersonalised state as a new laptop. And be very certain you’ve backed up all your personal files before you head down this path – the reinstaller may offer to keep your documents and settings, but if anything does get lost, that’s squarely on the head of the genius who decided to reformat their own hard drive. While I’m on this tack, don’t underestimate the power of physical cleaning. Much of the thrill of opening up a brand-new laptop is to do with the perfectly unsmudged screen, and the spotless, grease-free keys that respond precisely to your touch without the slightest hint of biscuit crumb. I recommend you turn off your laptop, grab a non-abrasive cloth (ideally microfibre if you have one) and give it a proper wipe down, inside and out. Then, turn it upside down and attack the keyboard with a handheld vacuum, giving the keys a good scrub with the brush, to dislodge any dust or morsels from around the edges. When you turn the thing the right way up, it’ll be like someone’s handed you a new computer. Maybe you do need a new one after all: signs to upgrade your laptop Sometimes buying a new laptop is unavoidable. Photograph: Westend61/Getty Images All the above notwithstanding, there are some situations where a new laptop is the right answer. As I’ve intimated, repairs and upgrades aren’t always possible, so if you’ve shattered the screen, the only solution might be to take a trip to the computer shop. A particularly irritating scenario is when the hardware is still working fine, but is too old to support the latest operating system and security patches. This tends to happen to Apple systems after about a decade, and it’s about to hit many millions of PCs on 14 October, when Microsoft cuts off support for Windows 10 . Computers that meet the hardware requirements for Windows 11 can upgrade for free, but the rest will be stuck out in the cold. If your computer is among that unhappy cohort – and for whatever reason you’re not in a position to install a non-Windows OS – then a new laptop is a must. While it’s possible to keep running an unsupported operating system, I can’t in all conscience recommend you do that. Without regular security patches coming down from the mother ship, you’d be a sitting duck for future hacks and ransomware attacks. This doesn’t necessarily mean you need to bin your existing laptop. You can install a free Linux operating system on almost anything, and use that for everyday tasks such as surfing the web, editing documents and spreadsheets in LibreOffice, and even making video calls. Another option is Google’s ChromeOS Flex platform, a free version of the Chromebook operating system that you can install on a wide range of laptops. Whether you use it yourself or pass it off to a friend or family member, you’ll have done your bit to extend the life of that particular device, and to defer the environmental cost of decommissioning it. Finally, let’s not pretend that there isn’t a social aspect to all of this. The whole point of a portable computer is that you can take it out and about with you, where people can see it. Rocking up in your local coffee shop with a David Cameron-era laptop makes a certain statement, and not necessarily a bad one: it shows you’re a loyal, practical sort of person, unswayed by the temptations of consumerism.

I finally succumbed to curiosity and bought myself a pair towards the end of winter, and they were just perfect for the shoulder season, keeping me warm even with bare legs. I’ve since developed a full-blown obsession with Uniqlo technical fabrics (Heattech scarves, Airism shorts …), but I don’t think I can hold the socks fully responsible. Monica Horridge Lovely booze-free bubbly L’Arjolle Zero sparkling equilibre £13.45 at Wine at Home I was surprised to discover there are some really good non-alcoholic wines out there that taste like the real deal. The L’Arjolle Zero sparkling equilibre was my favourite: with fine bubbles and depth of flavour, it’s a convincing alternative to real bubbly. I’m planning to get in a few bottles for Christmastime to moderate the intake a little and offer booze-free imbibers something tasty. Sophia Longhi A forever dress Reiss Atelier maxidress £428 at Reiss £428 at Next This Reiss Atelier dress was one of the most expensive things I’ve recommended , and I hesitated to include it, but it is a truly beautiful piece that I will wear for ever. Also – it’s on offer now! Jess Cartner-Morley A boot to hike for Sorel waterproof sneaker boot £139.49 at Sports Shoes £155 at Sorel And I never get tired of recommending my Sorel hiking boots. Sturdy but lightweight, ridiculously comfy, not stupidly expensive – and they actually look nice too. JCM Pitch-perfect camping MSR Hubba Hubba NX tent £474.99 at Cotswold Outdoor £560 at Go Outdoors I take my MSR Hubba Hubba tent wild camping all the time: it’s quick and intuitive to pitch and has two roomy porches, so it’s easy to share with another camper. And our Boutique Glamping bell tent comes to weddings, festivals and family camps with us; I love having headroom. Sian Lewis For more, read our guide to the best tents A knife made for gardens Niwaki hori hori knife £32 at Niwaki £32 at Burford My green-fingered aunt bought me a hori hori knife from Niwaki (as recommended in our piece on gifts so good we buy them on repeat ) and I’m obsessed: it makes weeding really fast – and fun! SL Joggers to pep up the WFH wardrobe Adidas Originals Firebird track pants £60 at Adidas £60 at Asos I bought the Adidas Firebird joggers in green after Peter Bevan highlighted them in his 50 men’s summer wardrobe updates . I wanted to update my work-from-home attire, so I don’t feel like such a slob when I pop out on my lunch break. These fit the bill perfectly: they’re comfy to sit in all day, but they also look good – plus they add a nice pop of colour to my wardrobe. Lily Smith Steamed rice microwave-style Sistema rice steamer £7.99 at Currys £7.99 at Amazon I’ve always wanted a rice cooker, but I don’t have the counter space. So when I saw Joanne Gould recommend this affordable microwave version in her review of the best rice cookers , I gave it a go. It produced much more delicious and less starchy rice than I’d ever managed in a saucepan, and all for £7.99. LS The perfect hot brush GHD Duet Blowdry hairdryer brush £379 at GHD £379 at Lookfantastic I thought nothing would make me part with my well-tried and very trusted Revlon One Step hot brush , but the GHD Duet Blowdry I tested for best hot brushes really did blow me away. A new favourite. Lise Smith The great kickstart coffee machine De’Longhi Magnifica Evo bean-to-cup coffee machine £419.99 at Lakeland £580 at Argos My family loves our De’Longhi Magnifica Evo bean-to-cup coffee machine (a kind house-warming gift), which takes the sting out of waking up by brewing fresh barista-style coffee at the touch of a button. It’s quick, easy to clean, and has a handy milk steamer for lattes and cappuccinos. I can’t face the morning without it. LS For more, read our guide to the best coffee machines Brilliant slow cooking Green Pan stainless steel slow cooker £215 at Currys Ninja 8-in-1 slow cooker £149 at John Lewis £150 at Argos Two of the snazzy slow cookers I tested during my epic kleftiko saga were particularly brilliant (the GreenPan and Ninja Foodi Impossible 8-in-1). Joanne Gould Microwave toasties Morphy Richards Mico £19.99 at Morphy Richards £19.99 at Amazon In testing toastie makers , I came across a nifty microwaveable version from Morphy Richards that will have to be prised out of my cold, dead hands when the time comes to pass it on to the lovely people at Gratitude Upcycle in Barnet. However, shout out to the McGuigan Mid shiraz red wine – which I tested for my piece on the best mid-strength drinks – as it’s the most surprising thing I keep buying; at 7% it just about tastes like the stronger stuff and is a good Sunday option. It’s in loads of supermarkets, too. JG Smash the potato mashing Oxo Good Grips smooth potato masher £12 at Dunelm £12 at Amazon I included the Oxo Good Grips potato masher in my Father’s Day gift guide , and it has revolutionised my mashing game. Light, fluffy and sorting your mash in seconds, it beats a wire-based design hands down and its ergonomic hand position is much easier to use. It’s also a doddle to clean: you won’t find old bits of potato stuck in the curves next time you go to mash. Charlie Allenby Big props to no-drops food-catcher Highchair food catcher £39.95 at Amazon I’ve got a nine-month-old, and there are an awful lot of things you throw cash at in the pursuit of making your life easier . One thing I couldn’t live without, though, is the Catchy. It’s essentially a bit of plastic that you fit beneath a highchair, and it catches any food, cutlery, plates and cups tossed over the side. They can then be plonked back in front of your baby because they haven’t hit the deck. CA Hydrogen hydration Echo water flask £283.99 at Healf £299 at Amazon I was sceptical about the hydrogen-infused water bottle (the price, the price!) in my test of the best water bottles , but became a convert – chug a bottle of it and I find I’m less dehydrated the morning after boozing. Zoë Phillimore Juice on the go Anker Nano power bank £19.99 at Anker £19.99 at Amazon As someone who uses my phone for everything, from paying for things to unlocking my front door, it cannot be without battery. The Anker Nano – rated best for portability in Pete Wise’s test of the best power banks – gives me peace of mind that I won’t lock myself out of the house if my phone dies. ZP The rise-and-shine alarm clock Lumie Bodyclock Spark 100 sunrise alarm clock £99 at Argos £99 at Boots I had modest expectations when I started writing the Filter’s guide to the best sunrise alarm clocks , but the Lumie Bodyclock Spark 100 dazzled me with its natural-feeling sunrise simulation. It often woke me pleasantly before the alarm went off. Pete Wise Budget-but-still-the-best child’s bike seat Polisport Bubbly Maxi Plus child seat £45 at Halfords A dirt-cheap Halfords child bike seat. I tried frame-mounted bike seats from a number of leading brands, from £35 up to £140. In the end, it was the cheapest of the lot that caused the fewest headaches.

I also had the confidence to invest in Fussy deodorant: it’s expensive, and too much to spend when you aren’t sure if it works – but you were correct , it does! Pippa Nice ice, baby Lékué ice cube box £17.50 at John Lewis £8.93 at Amazon In a bid to become the adult I always wanted to be – someone who always has ice in the house – I bought the Lékué ice box from one of our gift guides last Christmas. The abstract-shaped cubes are sharp and stylish, and were small enough to fit in my daughter’s water bottle this heatwave summer. Hannah Booth Ultimate camping mattress for one Coleman Supercomfort single camping mat £124.95 at Outdoor Action My wife caught sight of Linda Geddes gamely testing camping mats and was taken by the write-up of the Coleman Supercomfort. She ordered a single mattress immediately, and tells me it’s excellent. I’m not allowed anywhere near it. Andy Shaw The anytime massage gun Bob & Brad Q2 Pro massage gun £89.99 at Amazon I tested dozens of massage guns and was impressed by the Bob & Brad Q2 Pro – a small-but-mighty pummeller that’s portable. I packed it in my 100-mile ultra drop bag and, with 17 miles to go, its soothing muscle mashing turned me from the Tin Man to skipping Dorothy. Well, almost. Kieran Alger Bye chub rub, hello comfy run shorts Light control thigh slimmers, two-pack £20 at M&S My Marks & Spencer chub rub shorts were featured in our guide to keeping cool in hot weather . They’ve saved me for many summers now. Rhiannon Evans A game for all ages Marble run £15 at Argos £20 at John Lewis I also bought my son the marble run he asked for last Christmas . Both my kids loved it, actually … as did I. RE Stylish twist on the waterproof coat Patent faux leather coat £36 at Sainsbury’s Inspired by the Filter’s feature on how to look good in wet weather , I upgraded my waterproof jacket. It hadn’t occurred to me that a faux patent leather jacket could work just as well as a traditional waterproof. Sabine Wiesel Open your eyes to the swim mask Defy Ultra swim mask £115 at Aquasphere £97.55 at Amazon The Aquasphere Defy Ultra swim mask – which I included in my roundup of cold-water swimming essentials – is the most expensive pair of goggles I’ve bought, but worth every penny. I’ve swum multiple long-distance events in them. I look a bit like I’m wearing ski goggles and often get comments, but for comfort and field of vision in open water, they’re excellent. Ella Foote Brilliant babygrows with two-way zips Two-way zip baby sleepsuits, four- pack From £19 at Next I was pregnant when Paddy Maddison’s article on baby gear parents wouldn’t go without came out, and soon discovered that it should be illegal to make newborn babygrows or sleepsuits without two-way zips. I love these ones from Next. If you have a pregnant friend, do them a favour and get them a pack. Laura Potter Shoes to climb high in Veloce climbing shoe £110 at Nevisport £140 at Go Outdoors After writing my climbing kit article , I bought some Scarpa Veloce climbing shoes that were recommended by the coach I spoke with. They’re now my favourite ever climbing shoes. Tom Bruce An actually leak-proof water bottle Ion8 water bottle £12.99 at Decathlon £13 at Argos The Ion8, voted top budget option in Zoë Philimore’s test of the best water bottles , is the only leak-proof bottle I’ve used. It’s managed to survive in both my daughters’ school bags without an incident. Rebecca Goodman Camping loveseat for outdoor comfort Kelty low loveseat £114.95 at Wildbounds £148.95 at Amazon The Kelty loveseat camping couch won me brownie points when I bought it for my other half’s birthday. Well made and robust, it comfortably sits two people in a slouchy, relaxed manner. Perfect for evening campsites with a glass of beer in hand. Deborah For more, read our guide to the best camping chairs The frying pan that’s chemical-free De Buyer steel round pancake pan, 30cm £59.98 at Nisbets £57 at Amazon I’m a convert to frying pans with no coating that you season with oil instead. Having researched Pfas-free pans , I decided that even if the health risks are uncertain, I want to try to minimise the number of products I buy that contain forever chemicals because of the potential environmental cost. So I’m gradually replacing our pans with stainless steel and carbon steel ones. I’ve also discovered the joys of cooking with a crepe pan: as well as turning out excellent pancakes, my De Buyer Mineral B crepe pan is great for toasting wraps, and making okonomiyaki (Japanese fritters) . Linda Geddes The truly magic wand (vibrator!) Doxy die cast wand £131.55 at Secrets Shop £154.99 at Boots I named the Doxy Die Cast as my No 1 wand vibrator in my test of the best vibrators , and I stand by that decision. It’s unapologetically loud and hefty, and packs so much power that I’ve witnessed it make women climax through thick jeans. Alix Fox Must-have beauty gadget Ziip Halo £379.99 at Ziip Beauty There are so many beauty gadgets with high-ticket prices that it’s hard to know what’s worth investing in. The Ziip Halo microcurrent device, which I featured in my piece on at-home beauty treatments , is one of the unicorns. I’ve been using it for six months, a few times a week, and my skin looks more glowing, firmer and more snatched around the jaw. It’s so small that it fits in my makeup bag for holidays, too. Hayley Spencer Electric toothbrush with pearly service Suri 2.0 electric toothbrush £105 at Suri £105 at Boots I bought a Suri toothbrush and, while it’s definitely more of a pleasure to use than my previous one and is more sustainable, the thing I was most impressed with was the customer service. It stopped working, but I received a prompt response, and a replacement handle was posted to me straight away. Lisa Foreman The pregnancy pillow you always needed Dreamgenii pregnancy pillow £37.99 at Robert Dyas £53.99 at Debenhams A lot of pregnancy pillows are good at supporting your tummy while elevating the legs, but they’re less good at looking after your back. The Dreamgenii did both beautifully, keeping me in a stable position without waking at 3am to stuff cushions behind my lower back. The flat section joining it together also meant nothing moved about in the night – other than the baby, and me getting up to pee. It saw me through two pregnancies, as well as being a handy feeding pillow after each of my sons arrived. My husband tried (unsuccessfully) to pinch it for himself. Lucy Pavia Elevate your home dining Delouis mayonnaise £3.25 at Ocado £3.30 at Waitrose After testing so many delicious foods for the food filter , I’m slowly building a shopping list of my favourites. Here are a few standouts: Delouis mayonnaise (incredible, minimally processed dijon mustard), Ollie’s kimchi (a fiery, funky and lively local ferment), Cauldron authentic organic tofu (clean, complex and well priced) and M&S pitted green queen olives (delicious chunky gordal olives). Tom Hunt Secateurs that are a joy Niwaki GR Pro secateurs From £84 at Niwaki £99.99 at Crocus It was love at first snip with Niwaki’s GR Pro secateurs. I’d seen them about, but never before had the pleasure of taking a plant to task with them; the experience of testing a pair out for the Filter’s roundup of the best secateurs was a joy. The cut is more of a glide, and they sit so comfortably in the hand that it feels like being reunited with a favourite jumper. Matt Collins The gorgeous gunk-free cafetière Espro P7 French press £85.09 at Amazon Of the products I’ve tested, I’ve developed something of a soft spot for the Espro P7 French Press . The Espro has gone on a camping trip and a holiday to Scotland, and it’s been a godsend. It’s insulated so we could brew a litre of gorgeous-tasting coffee and work our way through it without it going stone cold, and the filter prevented 99% of the sludge from getting into our mugs. Spending almost three figures on a cafetiere may sound a bit bonkers, but when it makes great, gunk-free coffee and keeps it warm for an hour in the middle of a Welsh field, it almost seems like good value. Sasha Muller The ultimate office chair Herman Miller Aeron chair £1,385 at Herman Miller £1,399 at John Lewis The Herman Miller Aeron chair, from my test of the best office chairs . I loved it, my wife loved it, and the courier was mildly horrified when we sent it back, as he barely ever had to return one. Sadly, we can’t afford it. Stuart Andrews Hats off to the best cap Original Pirate Material cap £45 at Scrt I bought my husband the Original Pirate Material cap from Peter Bevan’s 50 men’s summer wardrobe updates just in time for Glastonbury. He loves the Streets and is never without a hat, so it was the perfect fit. Judging from the number of people we saw wearing the cap around Worthy Farm, I think a fair few Filter readers had the same idea. Ella Jinadu Hair care, honey pot style Gisou Honey Gloss ceramide therapy mask £19 for 75ml at Cult Beauty £19 for 75ml at SpaceNK The best thing I’ve tested this year, hands down, is the Gisou Honey Gloss ceramide therapy hair mask. I had tried the brand’s original mask before, and found it pretty average, but this new formulation somehow made my glossy hair dreams come true without weighing my hair down. It’s an investment, but if you have long, thick hair you want to look after, it’s a brilliant choice. Sarah Matthews Stirring stuff from a great fan Lume air circulator fan £149 at Lume The best product I tested for the Filter this year was the AirCraft Lume fan. It’s so well made that it’s practically silent, so the biggest challenge is forgetting it’s on. It has a cute backlight, too. Unsurprisingly, it’s been on preorder ever since we recommended it.

c5130223dc38,‘I’m a composer. Am I staring extinction in the face?’: classical music and AI,,"T he hacker mansion is part startup commune, part luxury crash-pad, part sales floor for the future. They are dotted around Silicon Valley, inhabited by tech founders and futurists. The most opulent I’ve seen is in Hillsborough, one of the Bay Area’s wealthiest enclaves, just south of San Francisco. Inside, marble floors gleam beneath taped-up portraits of tech royalty; in the gardens, gravel is raked into careful Zen spirals and pools shimmer beyond the hedges. It was a sunny June afternoon, and I had come with my producer, Fay Lomas, to record interviews for a BBC Radio 3 documentary about the collision of generative AI and classical music in San Francisco and Silicon Valley. All professional creatives, Fay and I were told cheerfully, would soon exist only as hobbyists. This was not provocation. Not irony. Just fact. It’s the one moment in the documentary when we hear Fay’s voice. She suddenly cuts in, unsettled: “So AI’s going to get rid of my job?” It’s brief. Instinctive. But it changes the air in the room. When we began making the documentary, I was as curious as anyone. “The cat’s out of the bag,” I joked. It felt like the sensible thing to say. The technology was here. Better to work with it than ignore it. Composer Tarik O’Regan and BBC producer Fay Lomas in Silicon Valley. Photograph: Joel Cabrita We moved so quickly from talking about how AI could help the creative industries to hearing, quite casually, how easily it could replace every role within them When I spoke to Fay recently, she remembered the moment clearly. “We moved so quickly,” she said, “from talking about how AI could help the creative industries to hearing, quite casually, how easily it could replace every role within them. The tone was friendly, encouraging, as if I should be excited.” That exchange feels like the hinge of the story: a small, human moment of bafflement, when the conversation stopped being theoretical and became real. They wanted to make us redundant. That was June. It’s now October, and with a summer dominated by Oasis back on tour in the UK and US, I’ve been thinking of another kind of mansion: the band’s concert at Knebworth House in 1996. A quarter of a million people over two nights, waving lighters instead of phones. One of the last great communal singalongs before everything changed. Before Napster and the MP3. Before mobile phones. Before the quiet rearranging of culture by invisible algorithms. Composer Ed Newton-Rex plays a keyboard piano while wearing a virtual reality headset at home in Palo Alto, California. Photograph: Marissa Leshnov/The Guardian What came next was subtle but seismic: a shift from ownership to access. Playlists replaced albums, not curated by artists but by software, made to melt into whatever else we were doing. Something to work to, shop to, scroll to. We thought we were watching the future of music. Perhaps we were. That is why I paused when, long after finishing the documentary, I read about RBO/Shift . It’s an exciting new initiative from the Royal Ballet and Opera exploring how the arts might “interact” with AI. It comes from an institution I care deeply about, run by people I respect and admire: one that has long supported me and many others. It’s presented as a bold, forward-looking conversation between technology and creativity: the beginning of what could be a fascinating partnership. Yet what stands out in the announcement is not what’s there, but what appears to be missing. There’s no mention of ethics, of training data, of consent, of the environmental cost, or of jobs. There’s no sense that this technology now threatens to make the artists and the craft the RBO has helped sustain, and that whole ecosystem of labour, largely redundant. A driverless taxi on the streets of  San Francisco. Photograph: Anadolu Agency/Getty Images The tone, much like the one we heard in that Hillsborough mansion, is unfailingly upbeat. “AI is here to stay,” Royal Opera artistic director Oliver Mears said last month in an interview with the New York Times. “We can either put our heads in the sand or ride the wave.” Except that nobody I meet in San Francisco – where this technology is being dreamed up, built and sold – is riding a wave . Riding a wave means surrendering to its pull. The people here have no interest in that. They’re trying to control the tides, to shift the moon if necessary. I don’t want to ignore AI. But that phrase I used earlier, “the cat’s out of the bag”, now feels like its own kind of moral laziness, as if ethics expire the moment something new arrives. After a summer inside the machine, it’s unsettling to watch major institutions treat AI like atomic energy for the arts: dazzling, lucrative, already leaking harm, and still somehow without a warning label. It’s unsettling to watch major institutions treat AI like atomic energy for the arts Things move so fast in this part of the world that our documentary already feels like a historical artefact, a postcard from the last moment before the future stopped asking for permission. That afternoon in the hacker mansion, with raked gravel, sunlight and calm, feels frozen now: the still point before acceleration. When I listen back, I can hear the air shifting. The pause after Fay’s question, my uneasy laughter. It’s the sound of nervousness, of something human still holding its ground. If Oasis at Knebworth was the last great pre-internet singalong, maybe this tiny moment we captured marks the uneasy breath before the machines start to hum their own tune.

775ed2f4b773,Money talks: the deep ties between Twitter and Saudi Arabia,,"A li al-Ahmed didn’t think that Elon Musk was responsible for the decline and fall of Twitter. Musk was another face representing an old regime. And its sins began well before Musk bumbled into Twitter HQ, in October 2022, carrying a porcelain sink. (In an attempt at humour, Musk posted a video of himself arriving at the Twitter offices carrying a sink with the caption “Entering Twitter HQ – let that sink in!”) Ahmed was a Saudi journalist and analyst living in the Washington DC area. He was a founder of the Institute for Gulf Affairs (formerly the Saudi Institute), a Saudi-focused thinktank with an emphasis on human rights reporting, and was the kind of expert – passionate, principled, always glad to hop on the phone – that journalists loved having in their digital Rolodex. For Ahmed, who over the years had many family members imprisoned by the Saudi royal family, the pursuit of human rights was a solemn task. But he also had a kind of garrulousness – breaking into asides about his children or the talking gadget he’d invented to remind them to wash their hands – that reminded one of the deeper human stakes. “Twitter is no different from Boeing or those military companies,” Ahmed told me. “They care about making money. Twitter and Facebook are not champions or models for human rights. These people are nothing but money-grubbers.” Twitter had banned Ahmed’s Arabic-language Twitter account, which had 36,000 followers (although he was allowed to keep his English-language account). I first spoke to Ahmed in 2021, when reporting on the Saudi government’s use of Twitter to unmask and arrest people posting critically about the regime. For Saudi authorities, Twitter was an asset in every sense. The billionaire Saudi businessman Prince Alwaleed bin Talal was Twitter’s largest outside shareholder, and the site had become a key tool in the government’s apparatus of surveillance and control. Ahmed believed his Twitter account had been compromised. He worried that spies had access to it, which would endanger dissident Saudis with whom he exchanged private messages. This wasn’t an idle concern. One of his contacts was Abdulrahman al-Sadhan , an aid worker who, in 2018, was abducted by Saudi security forces for running a satirical Twitter account that parodied members of the government. Abdulrahman, who was then 37, was sentenced to 20 years in prison. Saudi Arabia is carrying out more repression than ever, said Abdulrahman’s sister Areej al-Sadhan, who lived in the US when we spoke in 2021. In the first three years after her brother was arrested, her family had received only two brief phone calls from him. Saudi crown prince Mohammed bin Salman, had zero tolerance for dissent or mockery. Areej has not heard from her brother for years. In a 2023 court filing, she said that she wasn’t sure if her brother was alive. Despite his attempt to portray himself as a modernising reformer, Prince Mohammed could appear every bit as repressive as past Saudi rulers, turning the country into a surveillance state where arbitrary arrests and disappearances were routine. As the brutal murder of Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi demonstrated, the Saudi state pursued vigorous methods of transnational repression, allegedly sending hit squads after enemies abroad. Prince Mohammed used his country’s bottomless reserves of oil and capital to flood Silicon Valley, politics, sports leagues and other power centres with cash and influence. Venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz and Peter Thiel’s investment vehicle, Founders Fund, were among the most notable recipients of Saudi money, but they were just two among hundreds. In 2016, Uber received an astonishing $3.5bn from Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund (PIF). Blackstone’s infrastructure fund got $20bn . By autumn 2018, the Wall Street Journal reported , Saudi Arabia had become “the largest single funding source for US startups”. The Saudi-Silicon Valley relationship represented a convergence of shared interests. Saudi Arabia, like other Gulf dictatorships, wanted to wash its money, diversify its investments, deepen influence with its most powerful ally, extend soft power and counter its image as a repressive state responsible for a devastating war in Yemen. Silicon Valley offered all of that, along with access to cutting-edge technology and a business elite coming into its own. “They’re surveillance states. They’re police states,” said Nader Hashemi, a professor of Middle East and Islamic politics at Georgetown University. “They want to use the latest technology in order to continue to remain in power and surveil their populations. So they have another interest in trying to sort of be the beneficiaries of hi-tech developments, hoping that that will help them internally with their own political rule.” The Saudi government had vast assets held in the names of senior members of the royal family. Through his Kingdom Holding Company, Prince Alwaleed had interests in businesses like Lyft and Snapchat. And until Elon Musk came along, he was Twitter’s largest outside shareholder. As Saudi Arabia became the pre-eminent source of Silicon Valley capital, Alwaleed emerged as the country’s most recognisable mogul, taking the role of leading shareholder in Rupert Murdoch’s News Corp. By 2015, the prince owned an estimated 5.2% of Twitter. In November 2017, Alwaleed was arrested and confined to the Ritz-Carlton Hotel in Riyadh as part of a sweeping “anti-corruption” purge that forced numerous wealthy Saudis and members of the royal family to sign over their assets to Prince Mohammed. That may well have included Alwaleed’s Twitter shares. “Since late 2017 or January of 2018, Prince Mohammed has exercised control over more Twitter stock than is owned by Twitter’s founder,” according to a civil complaint filed against Twitter and the consulting firm McKinsey by Omar Abdulaziz, a film director and Saudi exile. Abdulaziz said that the consultancy helped finger him as a prominent online dissident, leading to his Twitter account being hacked. (In 2020, Canadian authorities warned Abdulaziz that he was a target of a Saudi kill team.) According to Abdulaziz’s original complaint, “Because of the tremendous wealth of key figures in [the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia], major corporations have enabled, collaborated with, and turned a blind eye to [its] efforts to suppress, torture, falsely imprison, terrorise and murder dissenters both within Saudi Arabia and around the world.” Twitter had given the Saudi government a reach well beyond its borders. A t the outset, Twitter had seemed like “a great equaliser”, said Ahmed. With no independent media in Saudi Arabia and most political expression forbidden, Twitter and other social media seemed initially a place for people to speak more frankly, especially when they could be pseudonymous. “That did not last,” he told me. By the second Obama administration, Saudi Twitter had become a place for the kingdom’s rulers to propagandise, track dissident thought and identify victims for Prince Mohammed’s personal team of enforcers. Many Saudis knew better than to post on Twitter under their real names. But the Saudi government was able to unmask pseudonymous accounts and trace their owners, who were then arrested. For a long time, dissident Saudis wondered how exactly government security forces had unmasked their friends and family members, and whether there were any countermeasures they could take. They assumed the Saudi government had access to the finest western security contractors and advanced spyware software. They didn’t yet know that Prince Mohammed and his henchmen had something better: a spy ring inside Twitter itself. In June 2014, a Saudi official named Bader Al Asaker took a tour of Twitter’s San Francisco headquarters. Asaker was the secretary-general of Prince Mohammed’s personal charity, the Misk Foundation, and head of the crown prince’s private office. One of the people who arranged the tour was a Twitter employee named Ahmad Abouammo . According to US prosecutors, Asaker was grooming Abouammo , who worked on media partnerships in the Middle East, to spy for him. In the months to come, Abouammo would receive more than $100,000 in cash and gifts as he gathered information – including email addresses, phone numbers and private messages – relating to Saudi dissidents, journalists and other accounts of note. ‘Let that sink in’ … Elon Musk takes over Twitter on 26 October 26 2022. Photograph: Twitter account of Elon Musk/AFP/Getty Images Abouammo got a new job at Amazon the following year, but the Saudi regime found a worthy replacement in Ali Alzabarah, a Twitter engineer whose position and technical skills gave him access to more user data than Abouammo. Soon enough, Alzabarah became an even more productive spy for Asaker and the Saudi regime, tracking dissidents across borders and providing IP addresses that could reveal people’s locations. In December 2015, an FBI agent visited the Twitter headquarters in San Francisco to tell them that they had a Saudi espionage problem. The FBI asked that Twitter refrain from taking immediate action but, reportedly suspicious about the intentions of government security agencies, which are known to pressure tech companies for private user information, Twitter decided to suspend Alzabarah. According to a federal indictment against Alzabarah, the engineer turned spy frantically called Asaker, who, along with the Saudi consul general of Los Angeles, helped spirit Alzabarah away to Saudi Arabia. After finding refuge there, Alzabarah was named CEO of the Misk Foundation. Almost a decade later, Alzabarah was still on X – where his account was locked for privacy – and on the FBI’s most-wanted list. Abouammo was arrested in November 2019 and indicted . A jury found him guilty on six criminal charges related to his spying. In December 2022, a judge sentenced him to three and a half years in federal prison. Twitter – and now X , as it was rebranded after Musk’s takeover – has never accounted publicly for the Saudi spy ring, nor has it discussed how it plans to keep foreign agents off its payroll. I f Saudi’s ruling class had doubts about Musk’s takeover of Twitter, they were short-lived. After initially criticising the brash Musk, Prince Alwaleed, now free from five-star confinement, supported his takeover effort, announcing he would roll his $1.89bn worth of shares (presumably controlled by Prince Mohammed) into the new venture. Asaker continued to use the site to propagandise to his more than 2.3 million followers. Despite Musk swooping into Twitter HQ with a promise to liberate users from the shackles of Silicon Valley technocrats, the user experience got worse. Meanwhile, Musk seemed openly transactional in his dealings with foreign governments. Whatever universal principles he claimed to hold appeared secondary, in practice, to his business concerns and his personal whims. This free-speech absolutist said nothing about Saudi Arabia’s abuse of his platform. Perhaps he was simply unaware. The company that once called itself “the free speech wing of the free speech party”, was now chasing viability via personal data collection and surveillance advertising. It did not protect its users from data breaches and it made devil’s bargains with foreign governments. As Ali al-Ahmed said, it was a typical US corporation. Except that this one had charged itself with a higher purpose and, in bumbling into foreign markets under autocratic governments where its product basically invited local people to break the law, it set up its users for trouble.

Photograph: Mohammed Al-Shaikh/AFP/Getty Images For Ahmed, the conviction of one Saudi spy, Abouammo, without any larger reckoning over the kingdom’s role at Twitter and in Silicon Valley, was a failure. As possibly the only known victim of the spy ring living in the US, Ahmed had offered to testify at Abouammo’s sentencing. After a video chat with representatives of the Department of Justice, he never heard back. “It was very clear that they were just trying to close this matter,” said Ahmed. “Imagine if this guy was doing it for the Iranians. Oh my God. He would get 20 [years].” He emphasised that, in a lawsuit regarding the murder of Jamal Khashoggi, the Biden administration had recognised Prince Mohammed as having sovereign immunity. The US government also intervened in a lawsuit against Prince Mohammed filed by Saad Aljabri, a former spy chief who had defected to the US. “I really think it was a betrayal of justice here,” said Ahmed. “It’s part of this foreign influence and the corruption that’s also now in the court system.” Twitter’s relationship with the Saudi government revealed how the company really operated. It wasn’t just a place for silly memes or catty media discourse or an attention-obsessed billionaire to cultivate his flock. It was an informational battleground, a crucial node in the broader media ecosystem, and formed part of the connective tissue between Silicon Valley and Gulf dictatorships. It revealed the company’s politics as riddled with the same kind of false populism and political opportunism embraced by Musk, Trump and Maga radicals. Twitter’s willingness to overlook horrific behaviour by a major investor wasn’t unique. It’s the default for most large corporations, the equivalent of a western oil giant paying bribes to operate in a foreign country. But the tech industry had long tried to paint itself as a bearer of progress, where technological innovation was synonymous with human flourishing. Twitter’s Saudi scandal showed that this wasn’t true at all. I t’s possible that there were other spies working at Twitter, just as there were likely foreign agents working throughout Silicon Valley. Economic espionage is an old story. But using tech companies’ surveillance-based business model to repress dissent at home and practice transnational repression abroad was a grimly novel phenomenon. It was common for tech companies operating in foreign markets – often with minimal local staff – to face political pressures. In many cases, the result was that formerly idealistic tech firms would make compromises over censorship if it meant having access to tens of millions of users in Turkey, Egypt, Pakistan, India or China. The cybersecurity specialist known by the mononym Mudge, who consulted for Twitter, testified before Congress that India and China had agents working inside Twitter who had broad access to user data. A month after Mudge testified, Elon Musk completed his harried acquisition of Twitter. The $44bn purchase price required him to take on a lot of debt and to solicit support from friends and allies from Hawaii to San Francisco to Riyadh. By buying Twitter, Musk inherited the Saudi spy scandal and the still-unresolved litigation associated with it. He inherited a major shareholder who had committed espionage against their own asset. Yet there was still a lot we didn’t know about Twitter, Saudi Arabia and Musk. I wanted to know more about who helped Musk take Twitter private and who now owned a piece of X. Who was this powerful, volatile billionaire potentially beholden to? It wasn’t something that Musk wanted to talk about. The company had done away with its PR department. In the public imagination, Musk was X – he owned it, he was its most popular user, he set its policies, he intervened personally when one of his favourite accounts encountered issues. He owed nothing to the media. He was enjoying its death throes. When Musk acquired Twitter, he fired thousands of people and, with his blithe disregard for the tenets of employment law, provoked numerous lawsuits. By early 2024, these lawsuits – by ex-employees who said they didn’t receive severance, were coerced into quitting, or were encouraged to break the law in order to implement Musk’s edicts – were winding their way through the courts. In some suits, the plaintiffs wanted X to submit a list of its shareholders to answer questions about accountability. Who were Musk’s partners? Who might be materially affected by a lawsuit against X? Did the judge own shares in Tesla or another Musk company? This was a legitimate concern. In 2023, a liberal media watchdog group, Media Matters, produced a report that accused the site of allowing antisemitic posts next to advertising, and Musk sued them for allegedly manipulating data in an attempt to “destroy” the platform. The suit was filed in a north Texas district where one of the judges turned out to be a Tesla shareholder. US district judge Reed O’Connor owned as much as $50,000 in Tesla stock when he took on Musk’s lawsuit against Media Matters. Judge O’Connor made a series of rulings in favour of Musk, and the case’s accumulating legal fees led to Media Matters laying off staff. In November 2024, X added a provision to its terms of service stating that all legal disputes would be settled in Judge O’Connor’s Northern District of Texas. (O’Connor ruled that his Tesla stock “is not relevant to the case”, but he recused himself from X’s case against the World Federation of Advertisers.) Elon Musk leaves after a bilateral meeting in Riyadh on 13 May 2025 in his role as senior adviser to President Trump. Photograph: Brendan Smialowski/AFP/Getty Images These kinds of shareholder document requests are common, and a corporate defendant may request to submit the information under seal, making it unavailable to the public (and potentially even the plaintiffs). In one of the cases I followed, Anoke v Twitter, one of the many civil lawsuits resulting from Musk’s chaotic takeover of the company and his mass firings of employees, X submitted a list of shareholders under seal. Wanting to file a motion to have the list unsealed, I reached out to Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press (RCFP), a first amendment organisation that offered pro bono services to journalists. Born out of the Nixon administration’s attempted censorship of the Pentagon Papers, RCFP had a distinguished history of first amendment litigation. They agreed to represent me. Together we found a few cases where it might be possible to unseal X’s shareholders list. The cases varied in their particulars, and some seemed more promising than others. But the public-interest claim was straightforward. The RCFP attorneys deployed precedent-laden arguments about X as a public square, media ownership and foreign influence and national security concerns. They contacted the many high-powered lawyers X was employing to fight these cases to formally let them know we would be filing motions to unseal. And by early July, they had completed the necessary filings. In July 2024, we officially filed a motion in the Northern District of California asking a federal judge to unseal a disclosure list of X’s shareholders in Anoke v Twitter. And then I waited. I t had cost about $46.5bn for Elon Musk to acquire Twitter. The money was cobbled together from $20bn in Musk’s assets, $13bn in loans from big banks (which soon found that they couldn’t move them off their books), $6bn in loans to Musk himself, and more than $7bn in commitments from investors who would be shareholders of the new private enterprise. In a financial statement submitted to the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in May 2022, Musk listed a number of his planned Twitter co-investors and their equity stakes, so we had some idea of who was helping him buy the company. Saudi Prince Alwaleed, Twitter’s largest outside shareholder, had initially been publicly critical of Musk’s offer and then – the reasons for the shift are unclear – announced that he supported Musk and would happily roll his shares into the new entity. Other reporting helped fill in some of the sources of money. But gaps remained. And once Twitter went private in October 2022 and Musk set about cutting back the divisions of the company that offended him, there was no official list of its shareholders, or the legal names of the trusts, funds, LLCs and other corporate entities holding their shares. Musk called himself a “free-speech absolutist”, but his business dealings tended to be filtered through the usual veil of corporate secrecy, legal threats, nondisclosure agreements, encrypted chats and fleets of powerful attorneys that protect very powerful people. He denounced “lawfare” – the aggressive use of lawsuits to punish one’s enemies – while widely practising it. He banned journalists from X when they displeased him and he ordered the reinstatement of the accounts of Nazis, white supremacists and a QAnon-adjacent influencer named Dom Lucre who’d once posted a screenshot from a video of a child being sexually abused. (He claimed he was drawing attention to the issue of child abuse.) On 20 August 2024, Judge Susan Illston of the Northern District of California ruled in favour of our motion in Anoke v Twitter. Hours after the ruling, the filing containing the list of X’s shareholders appeared on the online court docket, visible to anyone logged into the public court system. I’m still not exactly sure what happened, but apparently it’s a matter of a clerk clicking to change permissions on a limited-access filing, so it’s possible that someone at the court prematurely made the list available. The error, if it was one, was soon noticed by reporters at the Washington Post, who wrote an article about the list’s contents. Soon, the list was everywhere, published in hundreds of media outlets, becoming grist for debate, memes, misinformation, and – I hoped – researchers, regulators, and journalists looking into a powerful tech company openly in the tank for the Republican candidate for president. The list, which set out the legal names of about 95 entities owning a piece of X (but not the size of their holdings), began to fill in the picture of whom Musk depended on for cash and the networks he moved in. It was a window into a political and economic formation with increasing purchase on our world. It all started, of course, with Elon Musk. He was the majority owner of X through a trust he controlled. He was followed by Jack Dorsey, the former Twitter CEO and major shareholder who helped deliver the company to Musk. Then there was a host of other tech and finance figures, including many venture capitalists, friends of Musk who were consistent investors in his various enterprises. Some of these firms had close relationships with authoritarian governments, like Saudi Arabia and Qatar, who were direct investors in X. Andreessen Horowitz received hundreds of millions of dollars from Saudi Arabia to invest on their behalf in US tech startups and was in talks with the kingdom about creating a $40bn AI investment fund. Venture capital firms served as Laundromats for a class of kleptocrats, princelings and other global elites, who could funnel their fortunes into one of the US’s most celebrated industries. Silicon Valley venture capitalists and their foreign investors often shared a general disregard for democratic governance. In the Saudi crown prince, they saw a counterpart who demonstrated the same benevolent authoritarian style that they enacted in their business lives – but on an even grander scale, with unchallenged power. Venture capitalists published chatty manifestos about their technological aspirations; Prince Mohammed offered his own consultant-approved economic development plan known as Vision 2030. The two sides had much in common. “Saudi has a founder,” Ben Horowitz of Andreessen Horowitz said at a 2023 tech conference featuring Saudi government representatives. (In tech mythology, a “founder” has elite status.) “You don’t call him a founder. You call him his royal highness.” Saudi Arabia’s ailing king and ambitious crown prince were hardly “founders” of a state that, in its current form, had been inaugurated in 1932. But the rhetoric was not just flattery. It resonated in tech circles where an increasing number of people believed that the US would be better off under a dictatorial CEO figure, not an elected president. If Trump were re-elected, Musk had the potential to become that kind of figure. When Musk acquired Twitter, there were rumblings that the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) might investigate the deal. “I call on CFIUS to immediately conduct a review of the recent changes in Twitter’s ownership and governance,” Senator Chris Murphy wrote to Treasury secretary Janet Yellen. “It is essential to our national security that public officials and citizens alike can continue to rely on this platform to be a neutral platform, free of foreign influence.” In his letter, Murphy specifically cited concerns about the Saudi government using its investment “to silence government critics and human rights activists, or to further state-sponsored disinformation campaigns”. According to the Washington Post, the investigation never happened. X did not respond to a request for comment. A Twitter spokesperson said in 2021 that it acted swiftly in 2015 when it learned there were malicious actors accessing Twitter user data. The company also said it was committed to “protecting the public conversation” from abuse by state actors.

11ba0f52575a,Apple iPhone 17 Pro review: different looks but still all about the zoom,,"T he 17 Pro is Apple’s biggest redesign of the iPhone in years, chucking out the old titanium sides and all-glass backs for a new aluminium unibody design, a huge full-width camera lump on the back and some bolder colours. The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link. Learn more . That alone will make the iPhone 17 Pro popular for those looking to upgrade and be seen with the newest model. But with the change comes an increase in price to £1,099 (€1,299/$1,099/A$1,999), crossing the £1,000 barrier for the first time for Apple’s smallest Pro phone, which now comes with double the starting storage. From the front it looks like any recent Pro iPhone with the Dynamic Island containing the selfie camera at the top of the super bright and smooth screen. It is one of the best screens on a phone but identical to the regular iPhone 17, which has been upgraded this year. Higher peak brightness and a new anti-glare coating on the screen help cut down on reflections in bright light, making it easier to use outside. Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian The aluminium sides have been softened with a slight rounding to the edges, giving the phone a nice and comfortable feel in your hand without being too slippery. The phone has gained 5g in weight, which has pushed it over the 200g mark, making it on the heavier side for a smaller handset. A glass panel slightly larger than a credit card is inlaid into the aluminium body and is where MagSafe or Qi2.2 chargers and accessories attach. The large metal “plateau” at the top houses the cameras, which is even bigger than the camera bar on a Pixel . The aluminium will not crack like glass when dropped but it is more scratch-prone, particularly around the edges of the plateau , so a case is still prudent. The home and lock screens of iOS 26 now have a glassy, more rounded look to text and icons. Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian The handset runs the same iOS 26 as the rest of the iPhone lineup, which introduced Apple’s new “Liquid Glass” interface design. Generally it works well, but it has caused a bit of division over the transparency effects used for buttons and other elements, which blend into the background a little too much sometimes. Specifications Screen: 6.3in Super Retina XDR (120Hz OLED) (460ppi) Processor: Apple A19 Pro RAM: 12GB Storage: 256, 512GB or 1TB Operating system: iOS 26 Camera: 48MP main, 48MP UW and 48MP 4x zoom, 18MP front-facing Connectivity: 5G, wifi 7, NFC, Bluetooth 6, Thread, USB-C, Satellite, UWB and GNSS Water resistance: IP68 (6 metres for 30 mins) Dimensions: 150 x 71.9 x 8.75mm Weight: 204g Faster and cooler A19 Pro chip The iPhone fully charges in 76 minutes via USB-C, hitting 70% in half an hour using a 40W adaptor (not included) or 96 minutes using a Qi2 25W charger such as the Belkin UltraCharge 2-in-1 . Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian The 17 Pro has a new Apple A19 Pro chip at its heart, which is coupled for the first time in an iPhone with a vapour chamber cooling system. It is a common technique used in many high-performing Android phones and extracts heat from the chip, dispersing it into the rest of the phone’s body to cool it down and keep it running at peak performance for longer. It works well, with the back staying cooler than previous iPhones when playing games for extended sessions while producing better frame rates and being less sweaty to hold. The battery life is solid for a phone of this size, lasting about 42 hours between charges with about six hours of active screen use on a mix of 5G and wifi, which is about two hours longer than last year’s model. On heavy-use days out and about or playing lots of games, the 17 Pro still managed to end the day with a good 25% left in the tank. Most people will need to charge the phone every other day for regular use. Sustainability The camera plateau stops the iPhone 17 Pro rocking around on a desk as much as previous models. Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian The battery will last in excess of 1,000 full-charge cycles with at least 80% of its original capacity and can be replaced for £109 . Out-of-warranty screen repairs cost £349 . The specialists iFixit awarded the phone a seven out of 10 for repairability. It contains more than 30% recycled material, including aluminium, cobalt, copper, gold, lithium, rare-earth elements, steel, tin and tungsten. The company breaks down the phone’s environmental impact in its report. Apple offers trade-in and free recycling schemes, including for non-Apple products. Camera The simplified camera app automates more of the photo-taking and hides many features behind sliding buttons. Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian There are three 48-megapixel cameras on the back and a new 18MP selfie camera with a few new tricks on the front. The main and ultra-wide cameras are very similar to last year, shoot some great photos across a range of lighting conditions and are particularly good for street photography with solid detail. The main camera offers a 2x crop zoom, which is great, appearing similar in detail and colour to 1x shots in good light, although a little more grainy in dimmer lighting. New for this year is an upgraded telephoto camera that is now 4x at 48MP, up from 5x at 12MP, which produces very good, well-balanced photos that are full of detail. It can manage an 8x crop zoom similar to the main camera, which is equally good in bright light with only a slight degradation of detail. Both zoom levels do pretty well in dimmer indoor light, too. Zooming beyond 15-20x to a max of 40x magnification, the photos have obvious signs of being blown up by digital zoom. Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian All three cameras shoot some of the best video on a phone and have many other features, including an excellent macrophotography mode and the ability to shoot video from the front and rear cameras simultaneously, placing the operator into a little window. Apple’s automatic portrait mode is solid and works with objects, not only people and pets. Finally, the selfie camera has had its first upgrade on an iPhone in many years, beefed up to an 18MP sensor with Apple’s Centre Stage tech from its iPads and Macs. It has the ability to automatically pan and zoom to keep you in frame for video calls but it can also expand the frame to shoot landscape selfies when holding the phone in portrait orientation. It’s a novel solution to the problem of trying to fit everyone in for group selfies without having to turn the phone. Price The iPhone 17 Pro costs from £1,099 (€1,299/ $1,099 / A$1,999 ) with 256GB of storage. For comparison, the iPhone 16e costs £599 , iPhone 17 costs £799 , iPhone Air costs £999 , iPhone 17 Pro Max costs £1,199 , the Google Pixel 10 Pro costs £999 , the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra costs £1,099 and the Fairphone 6 costs £499 . Verdict The 17 Pro is the first different-looking iPhone in years, which instantly makes it stand out despite not being functionally all that different from recent models. The new aluminium unibody design feels nice, although it will scratch more easily than glass. The screen and performance are top-notch, while the battery life is solid for a fairly compact handset. It is a really nice iPhone and one of the very best phones that isn’t ginormous. But this year it competes with the super-thin iPhone Air, which steals some of the limelight, and an upgraded standard iPhone 17, which is cheaper but matches the Pro on screen quality for the first time, although it lacks a zoom camera. That leaves the camera as the big differentiator. The 17 Pro has top-notch cameras including a new and improved telephoto camera, which is one of the best in the business. So for an iPhone buyer who wants a telephoto camera to zoom in on your subjects, the 17 Pro is the model to get. You just have to pay a pretty penny for it. Pros: looks different to other models, relatively compact, great cameras including 4x/8x telephoto, upgraded selfie camera, great screen, USB-C, good battery life, top performance, long software support, Face ID. Cons: expensive, heavier than previous models, lack of cutting-edge AI features compared with rivals, same screen and size can be found on cheaper model.",https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/oct/08/apple-iphone-17-pro-review-different-looks-zoom-battery-life,Technology,BBC,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6b7d11d279bcb7bebdd0dde32529c7fe7684a68c/567_0_5840_4672/master/5840.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctcmV2aWV3LTUucG5n&enable=upscale&s=8eb7b0faaa45628356c0f1d182b32163",2025-10-08T06:00:18+00:00,e201c64b5a37ec106c75ab6c29a8c5fc55e5d838
fbc63ee43db3,Pixel 10 Pro XL review: Google’s superphone gets AI and magnetic upgrades,,"G oogle’s Pixel superphone is back, packed with a bigger battery, faster charging, magnetic accessories and even more cutting-edge AI tools to try to usurp Apple and Samsung as the monarchs of really big phones. The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link. Learn more . The Pixel 10 Pro XL is the largest slab phone Google makes and is one of the biggest available in Europe and the US. It costs £1,199 (€1,299/$1,199/A$1,999), sitting above its smaller sibling the Pixel 10 Pro and below the upcoming folding Pixel 10 Pro Fold, and competing directly with Apple’s iPhone 17 Pro Max and Samsung’s Galaxy S25 Ultra . The 10 Pro XL is almost identical on the outside to the 9 Pro XL it replaces in terms of dimensions but with 11g of additional weight. It is a big, heavy phone that requires two hands to use most of the time and benefits from a phone grip or handle. The Pixel has a ring of magnets to attach any number of Qi2 or MagSafe accessories to the back including phone grips, such as the Popsocket, as well as car mounts, wallets, stands and batteries. Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian It has a huge, bright and smooth OLED screen, which is one of the very best and excellent for watching TV and films. The back hides Qi2.2 wireless charging and magnetic accessory support, making it one of a very small number of phones that can charge at up to 25W using a new generation of wireless chargers. The 10 Pro XL has the same Google Tensor G5 chip as the rest of the Pixel 10 lineup and performs just as well , feeling rapid in general use. It plays games just fine, but those wanting the best graphics and frame rates in high-end mobile games are better served by rivals with Qualcomm’s top Snapdragon chip, such as the S25 Ultra. The biggest Pixel also has the largest battery with the longest run time. The 10 Pro XL matches its predecessor, lasting about 52 hours between charges after a mix of usage across wifi and 5G. The phone should outlast even the heaviest of usage days, with most people probably needing to charge it every other day. The phone takes less than 90 minutes to charge via cable or about two hours using a Qi2 25W wireless charger, such as the Ugreen MagFlow 2-in-1 (left) or Belkin UltraCharge Pro (right).

Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian The 10 Pro XL has the same Android 16 software and AI features as the 10 Pro , making it one of the most expressive and polished experiences available. Google will provide updates until 2032 . The Gemini chatbot is available throughout the system, and has its own stand-alone app that can see what is on your screen or through the camera to help. But the standout new feature is Magic Cue, which runs locally in the background as a proactive little helper presenting data from your calendar, emails, chats and other Google apps on your phone when you need it. It will pop up with the location of a restaurant when a friend texts about your dinner date or shows your order emails in the phone app when you ring a recognised business. It works great in Google’s various apps, and a handful of third-party ones, but not WhatsApp or other popular messaging apps yet. The 10 Pro XL also comes with a year’s subscription for Google AI Pro , for access to the company’s more powerful Gemini models, and 2TB of cloud storage for photos, files and email, worth £19 a month. Camera Point and shoot with the 10 Pro XL and you are almost guaranteed a great shot regardless of the conditions Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian The big Pixel has the same camera system as the 10 Pro , meaning your choice is only about phone size not camera quality. The 50-megapixel main, 48MP ultra wide and 48MP 5x telephoto cameras are some of the very best you can get. Point and shoot with the 10 Pro XL and you are almost guaranteed a great shot regardless of the conditions. It also has a handful of helpful AI tools including: the novel Camera Coach ; Add Me , which blends two photos to put the photographer into group shots; and Best Take , which has now been made automatic. It helps get group shots where everyone is looking at the camera by shooting a photo when everyone is looking once you press the shutter button or blending multiple shots where needed. Finally, it has the Pro Res Zoom feature that kicks in when you push beyond 30x magnification and uses genAI to put the detail and sharpness back into images lost to digital zoom. It isn’t always perfect and is switched off when the system detects a person, but it can have remarkable results, making blurry 100x zoom images much clearer and more usable. But it is also not a true photo at that point, as it has been interpreted and remade by AI, and is labelled as such by the camera app using C2PA content credentials . Overall, whether you use the AI tools or not, the Pixel has one of the very best camera systems on the market.

The Pixel 10 Pro XL contains 29% recycled materials by weight including aluminium, cobalt, copper, glass, gold, plastic, rare-earth elements, tungsten and tin. The company breaks down the phone’s environmental impact in its report and will recycle old devices for free. Price The Google Pixel 10 Pro XL costs from £1,199 (€1,299/ $1,199 / A$1,999 ) in a choice of four colours. For comparison, the Pixel 10 costs from £799 , the Pixel 10 Pro from £999 , the Pixel 9a costs £399 , the Galaxy S25 Ultra costs £1,249 and the iPhone 17 Pro Max costs £1,199 . Verdict The Pixel 10 Pro XL is a true superphone in size, price and capability. If you like what Google’s been doing with 6.3in smartphones but want everything bigger, this is the model to get. The camera is one of the very best, the screen is great and the software, including Google’s most cutting-edge AI features, is top notch. The addition of Qi2.2 support speeds up wireless charging, but more helpfully opens up a world of magnetic accessories including grips to make the big phone easier to hold. The Pixel feels responsive but it isn’t a dramatic upgrade on last year’s 9 Pro XL model . When it comes to raw power, particularly for games, the Pixel falls short against rivals such as the Samsung’s Galaxy S25 Ultra, which remains the superphone to beat . Pros: seven years of software updates, great camera with 5x and 10x optical magnification plus AI zoom, great big screen, Magic Cue and impressive local AI features, Qi2.2 wireless charging and magnetic accessory support, good battery life, great size, fast fingerprint and face recognition, 12 months of Google AI Pro included. Cons: very expensive, huge and heavy, face unlock option not as secure as Face ID, raw performance and battery life short of best-in-class, no physical Sim card slot in the US, not a massive upgrade. Note that the Pixel 10 Pro XL comes without a physical sim slot in the top of the phone in the US, relying entirely on eSims.

00500fa764eb,Google Pixel 10 Pro review: one of the very best smaller phones,,"The Pixel 10 Pro is Google’s best phone that is still a pocketable, easy-to-handle size, taking the excellent Pixel 10 and beefing it up in the camera department. The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link. Learn more . That makes it a contender for the top smaller phone with Apple’s iPhone 17 Pro, offering the best of Google’s hardware without an enormous screen. It is also the cheapest of three Pixel 10 Pro phones starting at £999 (€1,099/$999/A$1,699) sitting below the bigger 10 Pro XL and the tablet-phone hybrid the 10 Pro Fold. The 10 Pro looks almost identical to last year’s version and has the same size 6.3in OLED screen as the Pixel 10 but slightly brighter, slicker and crisper. It is one of the best displays on a phone, while the polished aluminium sides and mat glass back look expensive even if the colour choice is rather staid compared with its cheaper sibling. Qi2 support makes the Pixel compatible with magnetic chargers, such as the Anker 5K MagGo Slim that attaches to the back of the phone. Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian The 10 Pro is one of the first phones to come with Qi2 wireless charging built into the back, which offers compatibility with a range of magnetic accessories, including those made for Apple’s MagSafe. Inside is Google’s latest Tensor G5 chip, which is about 35% faster than last year’s model but falls short of the best-in-class performance of Qualcomm’s top Android chip used in rivals . Day to day the 10 Pro feels rapid, and it handled games just fine, though there are better options for those who want the absolute best graphics and frame rates. The Pixel has solid battery life, managing up to about two days between charges with about seven hours of active screen use on a mix of 5G and wifi. Most people will need to charge it every other day, but on heavy use days out and about in London on 5G it still managed to reach midnight with at least 25% left. The Pixel 10 Pro takes 90 minutes to fully charge using a 30W or greater power adaptor (not included), hitting 52% in just over half an hour. Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian Specifications Screen: 6.3in 120Hz QHD+ OLED (495ppi) Processor: Google Tensor G5 RAM: 16GB Storage: 128, 256, 512GB or 1TB Operating system: Android 16 Camera: 50MP + 48MP UW + 48MP 5x tele; 42MP selfie Connectivity: 5G, nano + e-sim (US: e-sim-only), wifi 7, UWB, NFC, Bluetooth 6 and GNSS Water resistance: IP68 (1.5m for 30 minutes) Dimensions: 152.8 x 72.0 x 8.6mm Weight: 207g Android 16 with AI everywhere Google’s take on Android is colourful, fairly simple and easy to use with a reasonable amount of customisation. Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian The phone ships with Android 16 installed, with security and software updates until August 2032 , ensuring it stays up to date for the life of the phone. It is the same software as the regular Pixel 10 with a bold, colourful and fun design. Google has shoved AI in almost every corner of the phone, most of it powered by the latest local Gemini Nano models, which means your data doesn’t have to leave your device to be processed, preserving privacy. The advanced Gemini chatbot is capable of interacting with your apps, seeing what is on your screen or through your camera, and having live back-and forth-conversations via voice. Magic Cue provides quick access to contextual information from the data stored on your phone across a number of Google and third-party apps. Composite: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian But the standout new feature is Magic Cue , which runs in the background and combines information from your Google account with data on your phone to offer help or quick suggestions in a number of Google apps. For instance, when you ring a business, Magic Cue pops up a card directly in the phone app showing your emails with your order confirmation details for one-tap access when you need them. Magic Cue works locally with about 10 days’ worth of data so it is not keeping a permanent log of everything you do, but has been genuinely useful in testing. It only works in Google’s and a select number of third-party apps, such as eBay, but not WhatsApp, so its utility is limited if you don’t use the right apps. The 10 Pro also comes with a year’s subscription to Google AI Pro , which usually costs £19 a month, and provides access to the more powerful Gemini Pro, image and video-generating models, plus 2TB of cloud storage for Google Drive, Photos and Gmail. Camera The camera app is simple to use with plenty of modes to make the best of your photography, including manual controls. Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian The 10 Pro has some of the most powerful cameras on a smartphone with a 42-megapixel selfie, 50MP main, 48MP ultrawide and 48MP 5x telephoto camera capable of an optical zoom quality up to 10x. But it is also the first to feature generative AI image processing directly in the camera, which is impressive but calls into question what a photo really is. The main camera is one of the best in the business, effortlessly capturing great photos that are rich in detail across a range of lighting conditions. The ultrawide camera is also very good for landscapes and group shots, and is used for the great macrophotography mode for fun closeups. The 5x telephoto is one of the very best on a phone and can shoot photos at 10x, which remain good quality, particularly in bright conditions. Google excels in difficult lighting conditions such as very bright or contrasting scenes, while in dark environments its night sight produces sharper images with more accurate colours than rivals. The Pixel’s portrait mode is greatly improved this year, too. Pro Res Zoom above 30x uses a local generative AI model to recreate the detail lost by digital zoom, saving both pre- and post-processed images for you to choose from. Composite: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian Zoom beyond 30x up to 100x and the phone uses a local genAI model to put back into the photo the detail and sharpness lost from digital zoom. Generally it works well but not flawlessly. It can get the perspective wrong or superimposes the wrong details, creating images that are clearly made by AI. But shoot predictable subjects such as buildings, cars or trees, and it firms up the digitally stretched details making the 100x zoom surprisingly usable. When it detects a person it does not even attempt to use the genAI model, which is probably for the best, and like all genAI systems it can struggle with words, often producing something that looks like an alien script. The camera app adds C2PA content credentials to all photos that records how the image was captured and whether generative AI was involved, including for the new zoom and popular Add Me feature from last year. Best Take has been made automatic, allowing the camera to capture multiple images when you press the shutter button to try to get one where everyone’s looking at the camera. The 10 Pro also has the same new AI Camera Coach feature as the regular 10, which teaches you how to get a better shot by analysing the scene through the camera and giving you options for different angles and framing. The camera also has plenty of fun photography and video modes, shoots great films as well as photo, and cements the 10 Pro as one of the very best on the market. Sustainability The front and back of the Pixel are covered in scratch-resistant Gorilla Glass Victus 2.

Verdict The Pixel 10 Pro doesn’t reinvent the wheel or set a new bar in quite the same way as the base-model Pixel 10 managed this year . But it still upgrades its already market-leading camera and AI features. It is snappy in operation, has decent battery life and still looks good, though hardcore gamers may want to look elsewhere for more powerful graphics. Google’s take on Android is one of the best and comes with long-term support so you can keep using it for years. Gemini’s various new tools are generally useful and less gimmicky than many. Magic Cue has great potential to be a time-saver without getting in the way, but needs to be expanded to more apps. Injecting genAI directly into the camera app improves its extended zoom images, but further blurs the line between what is and isn’t a photo – a philosophical debate most will probably gloss over because the tool is useful and avoids doing anything outlandish. The Pixel 10 Pro is easily one of the best smaller phones available and really hammers home just how much more advanced Google’s AI tools are than Apple’s and other rivals. Pros: seven years of software updates, great camera with 5x and 10x optical magnification plus AI zoom, Magic Cue and impressive local AI features, Qi2 wireless charging and magnetic accessory support, solid battery life, great screen and size, fast fingerprint and face recognition, 12 months of Google AI Pro included.

75182446096b,Honor Magic V5 review: fantastic foldable phone that needs better Android software,,"Honor’s latest foldable phone-tablet attempts to usurp Samsung as the leader of the pack with a super-thin body, massive battery and a ginormous camera lump on the back. The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link. Learn more . The Magic V5 is an impressively thin piece of engineering, slimmed down to about 8.9mm thick when shut, with each half about the same thickness as a USB-C port. It feels very similar to a standard slab phone in the hand, but one you can open up like a book for a mini-tablet on the go. The foldable costs £1,699.99 (€1,999.99), undercutting the competition from Samsung and Google by up to £100, but still very much at the eye-wateringly expensive end of the smartphone market. The Magic V5 comes in various colours with different materials on the back that make the phone varying thicknesses and weights. At 222g or under it is slightly heavier than Samsung’s latest Fold 7, but far lighter than the rest of the folding phone competition, and about the same weight as a large slab phone . When closed the Magic V5 is about the same weight, thickness and width as a large regular phone. Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian The outside 6.43in OLED screen is great and acts just like a regular phone while the inside 7.95in folding screen is one of the best, with an impressive brightness. It still has a crease down the middle but you don’t notice it in use. The inside screen is necessarily softer than traditional phone screens to allow it to bend, so you have to treat it with care; and it is a fingerprint magnet. The Honor is one of the first folding phones to be water- and dust-resistant to similar standards as a regular phone. That means fine particles shouldn’t be able to get behind the moving, flexible screen and metal hinge, which has been a durability concern for all foldables. Specifications Main screen: 7.95in (403ppi) 120Hz OLED flexible display Cover screen: 6.43in (405ppi) 120Hz OLED Processor: Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite RAM: 16GB Storage: 512GB Operating system: MagicOS 9.0.1 (Android 15) Camera: 50MP + 50MP ultrawide + 64MP 3x tele; 2x 20MP selfie Connectivity: 5G, dual sim + esim, USB-C, wifi 7, NFC, Bluetooth 6, GNSS Water resistance: IP58 and IP59 (immersion and high pressure jets) Dimensions folded: 156.8 x 74.3 x 8.88-9mm Dimensions unfolded: 156.8 x 145.9 x 4.1-4.2mm Weight: 217-222g Top Snapdragon chip and a high-capacity battery A full charge takes 55 minutes using a standard 100W USB-C power adaptor (not included), hitting 70% in under half an hour. Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian The Magic V5 has Qualcomm’s current top Android chip, the Snapdragon 8 Elite, matching rivals and flagship phones . It feels responsive in day-to-day activities, plays games very well and doesn’t get too hot when pushed hard. But that power is best used when multitasking, as you can run up to four apps on screen at once – half as many as Samsung’s Fold 7 but more than enough to actually be able to use. More impressive is the high-capacity battery Honor has managed to squeeze into the svelte frame, which is larger than most big slab phones, let alone folders. That means the battery life is great, but as with other folding phones it varies a lot depending on which screen you use most. Used primarily as a tablet for browsing and watching video with four hours of 5G usage, the Magic V5 lasts a good 37 hours between charges. With more balanced usage across the two screens it lasts into a third day before running out of juice. MagicOS software still needs work Multitasking on the large internal display is great, with up to three apps in split-screen. Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian The Magic V5 runs Honor’s MagicOS 9, which is based on last year’s Android 15 rather than the latest Android 16. But Honor will provide seven years of Android version and security updates for devices sold within Europe, which is a dramatic improvement over previous efforts, and similar in length to its main rivals. The software has some good ideas, but as with previous versions it still has some rough areas and irritating behaviours. The outside screen works mostly like any other Android phone with Gemini and various other AI tools. But it is on the inside screen where the software shines and irritates. You can place three apps in a splitscreen at once, with one of them pushed partially off the side of the screen to provide more space for the other two without quitting it. Tapping it brings it back on to the screen to use it. It’s a smart idea first seen on the OnePlus Open . A button on the taskbar makes arranging your multiple windows easy. Mini floating windows allow desktop-like multitasking. Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian But tap on an app notification on the inside screen and the system insists on opening the app in a mini-window, even if you wanted it to be full screen. That might be fine for smaller messaging apps such as WhatsApp, but I never want to open Gmail or larger-format apps in tiny windows that then need to be tapped a couple more times to fill the full screen. The software also doesn’t make good use of the partially folded modes that the inside screen can adopt, lacking an equivalent to Samsung’s good Flex mode , which seems like a wasted opportunity. Another bug in the typeface on the Honor makes it very difficult to see which emails are unread in bold in Gmail, which is extremely irritating. Much of these little annoyances would be acceptable on cheaper smartphones, but not on a £1,700, ultra-premium device. Honor still has work to do. Camera The camera app has multiple modes to shoot closed, half open, fully open or using the main cameras for selfies. Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian The Magic V5 has a decent set of cameras housed in an enormous round camera lump that protrudes from the rear of the phone. The main 50-megapixel camera shoots good-looking images across a range of lighting conditions, though it can become a bit soft with weaker indoor lighting. The 50MP ultra-wide camera is solid, but displays a bit of warping around the edges of the scene and lacks a bit of fine detail. The 64MP 3x optical telephoto camera is the best of the bunch, with good detail and colour, even in indoor lighting. It can manage a 6x in-sensor zoom, which is a bit softer on detail when viewed at full size but works well in bright light, plus digital zoom up to 100x that remains fairly decent up to about 20x magnification. The two 20MP selfie cameras are good enough, but you get much better results using the main camera and the outside screen for a viewfinder. The camera has many different modes to play around with including a smart motion capture system that handles action photography and solid video capture. It also has a lot of AI and enhancement features that are common to Chinese smartphones modifying the appearance of faces and the alike should you wish. Overall the camera is one of the better ones on a foldable, though it can’t match the best cameraphones on the market. Sustainability The capacitive fingerprint scanner in the power button works well in the thin frame. Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian The battery has an expected lifespan of at least 1,200 full-charge cycles with at least 80% of its original capacity. The Magic V5 is generally repairable by Honor, with internal screens costing about £700 or external screens about £200 to replace out of warranty. Honor offers a free screen repair for 12 months if bought within the first month of release. The device contains some recycled plastic. Honor publishes limited environmental reports and offers trade-in and refurbished products . Price The Honor Magic V5 costs £1,699.99 (€1,999.99). For comparison, the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 costs from £1,799 , the Google Pixel 10 Pro Fold costs £1,749 , the Galaxy S25 Ultra costs £1,249 and the Honor Magic 7 Pro costs £1,099 . Verdict Yet again Honor has produced some exquisite folding phone hardware that is let down by its software. MagicOS has improved over the last few years , but it lacks much of the customisation and capabilities possible on rivals. The biggest problem is that it lacks polish, with rough patches or irritating behaviours across the system. None of them is a deal-breaker, but they build up and can’t be overlooked on a £1,700 phone. It’s a shame as the phone is fast, the battery life is great, the camera is highly capable and it looks fabulous. It’s good to see Samsung and Google get some meaningful competition in book-style foldables. But at about the same price as the market leader, Samsung, there’s little reason to pick the Magic V5 over it. Pros: super-slim phone and tablet in one, light, just like a normal phone when closed, great performance, very long battery life, good internal screen, decent camera, good fingerprint scanner, water and dust resistance rating. Cons: very expensive, software not as refined as needed with irritating behaviours, more fragile than a regular device, costly to repair, limited folding modes. The Magic V5 is an attractive and well-made device.

f30a414206e0,"AirPods Pro 3 review: better battery, better noise cancelling, better earbuds",,"A pple’s extremely popular AirPods Pro Bluetooth earbuds are back for their third generation with a better fit, longer battery life, built-in heart rate sensors and more effective noise cancelling, and look set to be just as ubiquitous as their predecessors. The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link. Learn more . It has been three years since the last model , but the earbuds still come only in white and you really have to squint at the details to spot the difference from the previous two generations. The AirPods Pro 3 cost £219 (€249/$249/A$429), making them £30 cheaper in the UK than when their predecessors launched, and sit above the AirPods 4 , which cost £169 with noise cancelling for those who don’t like silicone earbud tips. The shape of the earbuds has been tweaked, changing slightly the way you put them in and making them more comfortable than their predecessors for extended listening sessions of three hours or more. Five sizes of tips are included in the box, but if you didn’t get on with silicone earbuds before these won’t make a difference. The stalks are the same length as before , but the shape of the earbud has been changed to better align the tip with your ear canal. Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian Most of the features are fairly standard for modern earbuds. Squeeze the stalks for playback controls, swipe for volume or take them out to pause the music. They support the same new features rolled out to Apple’s older earbuds, including the ability to use them as a shutter remote for the camera app and for live translation with the Translate app on the iPhone. The latter is limited to English, French, German, Portuguese and Spanish for now and isn’t available in the EU, but it works surprisingly well for casual conversations. The biggest problem is that the other person will have to rely on reading or hearing your translated speech from your iPhone. I can see it being most useful with announcements or audio guides – the kind you get on transport or in museums where you need only to translate language one way. The most interesting added hardware feature is heart rate monitoring via sensors on the side of the earbuds, similar to Apple’s Powerbeats Pro 2 fitness buds . They can be used with more than 50 workouts started in the Fitness app or a handful of third-party apps on the iPhone and proved to be roughly in line with readings from a Garmin Forerunner 970 or an Apple Watch during walks and runs. The earbuds are water-resistant to IP57 standards, which makes them much more robust against rain and sweat than before. The battery life has been increased by a third to at least eight hours of playback with noise cancelling for each charge, which is very competitive with some of the best rivals and long enough for most listening sessions. The compact flip-top case provides two full charges for a total playback time of 24 hours – six hours short of the previous generation, but five minutes in the case is enough for an hour of listening time. Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian Specifications Connectivity: Bluetooth 5.3, SBC, AAC, H2 chip, UWB Battery life: eight hours ANC playback (24 hours with case) Water resistance: IP57 (buds and case) Earbud dimensions: 30.9 x 19.2 x 27.0mm Earbud weight: 5.6g each Charging case dimensions: 47.2 x 62.2 x 21.8mm Charging case weight: 44g Case charging: USB-C, Qi wireless/MagSafe, Apple Watch Bigger sound and impressive noise cancelling The silicone earbuds are infused with foam in the tips that expands slightly for a better seal for music and noise cancelling. Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian The sound of the third-generation AirPods Pro takes a great listen and makes it bigger. They have a wider soundscape that makes big tracks sound more expansive, while still maintaining strong but nicely controlled bass. They are detailed, well-balanced and do justice to different genres of music, with plenty of power and punch where needed. As with Apple’s other headphones, they sometimes sound a little too clinical, lacking a bit of warmth or rawness in some tracks, and they can’t quite hit the very deepest of notes for skull-rattling bass. However, few earbuds sound better at this price and size. Apple’s implementation of spatial audio for surround sound for movies remains best in class, adding to the immersion with compatible devices and services, even if spatial audio music remains a mixed bag. The AirPods Pro are the best combination of earbuds and compact case that you can easily fit in a pocket. Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian The improved noise cancelling is the best upgrade. Apple says it is twice as effective as the already good AirPods Pro 2, which sounds about right. In side-by-side comparisons, the AirPods Pro 3 handle street noise, including cars, horns and engines, almost as well as the class-leading Sony WH-1000XM6 , which is thoroughly impressive given they are large over-ear headphones, not little earbuds. They also do a great job of dampening the troublesome higher tones such as keyboard clicks and speech, making the commute and office work more bearable. Apple’s class-leading transparency mode is just as good on the new earbuds, sounding natural as if you weren’t actually wearing the earbuds. It makes using them as hearing aids or out on the street with some dampening of sudden loud sounds very good indeed. Call quality is first-rate, and my voice sounded clear and natural in quiet or noisy environments with only a hint of road noise from some loud streets audible on the call. Sustainability The case charges via USB-C, MagSafe, Qi or Apple Watch charger, and has a new feature to limit charging of the earbuds to prolong their battery health. Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian Apple does not provide an expected lifespan for the batteries. Those in similar devices typically maintain at least 80% of their original capacity for 500 full charge cycles. The earbuds are not repairable, but Apple offers a battery service for £49 per earbud or case and offers replacements for those lost or damaged costing from £79 an item. The repair specialists iFixit rated the earbuds zero out of 10 for repairability . The AirPods and case contain 40% recycled material by weight including aluminium, cobalt, copper, gold, lithium, plastic, rare earth elements and tin. Apple offers trade-in and free recycling schemes and breaks down the environmental impact of the earbuds in its report . Price The AirPods Pro 3 cost £219 (€249/ $249 / A$429 ). For comparison, the AirPods 4 start at £119 , the Beats Powerbeats Pro 2 cost £250 , the Sennheiser Momentum TW4 cost £199 , the Google Pixel Buds Pro 2 cost £219 , the Sony WF-1000XM5 cost £219 and the Bose QuietComfort Ultra earbuds cost £300 . Verdict The AirPods Pro 3 take what was great about the ubiquitous second-generation models and improves almost everything. Longer battery life and a better, more comfortable fit for extended listening sessions are very welcome, as is the bigger, wider sound. Proper water resistance and built-in heart rate monitoring makes them useful for workouts, particularly those such as powerlifting that make wearing a watch difficult. The live translation feature worked better than expected, but has limitations that make it less useful for real-life conversations. The best bit is very effective noise cancelling that rivals some of the greatest over-ear headphones, but in a tiny set of earbuds that are much easier to carry around. Audiophiles will find they sound a little too clinical. While they work with any Bluetooth device, including Android phones, PCs and games consoles, they require an iPhone, iPad or Mac for full functionality. But the biggest letdown remains repairability , which remains a problem for most true wireless earbuds and loses them a star . Pros: very effective noise cancelling, great sound, best-in-class transparency, water resistance, built-in HR monitoring, great controls, advanced features with Apple devices including spatial audio, very comfortable, excellent case, top class call quality. Cons: extremely difficult to repair, expensive, no hi-res audio support, lack features when connected to Android/Windows, look the same as predecessors, only available in white. The AirPods Pro 3 are some of the very best earbuds you can buy, particularly if you use an iPhone.

8bb7e3d15be0,Apple Watch Series 11 review: wrist-flickingly good with longer battery life,,"The Apple Watch Series 11 adds the one thing most people actually want from a smartwatch: longer battery life. The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link. Learn more . Otherwise the new model is a direct replacement for the Series 10 , matching it in design, dimensions and features, with most of its upgrades coming from software. That makes it one of the very best smartwatches available, even if it hasn’t changed much. The Series 11 is also £30 cheaper in the UK, costing from £369 (€449/$399/A$679), and sits above the newly revamped £219 Watch SE at the low end and the £749 Ultra 3 at the high end. The Series 11 comes in space grey, which was a colour first introduced with the iPhone 5s in 2013 . Everything that is old is new again. Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian Like last year’s Series 10, the new model is only 9.7mm thick, which makes it a slim fit to the wrist, easy to sneak under cuffs and more comfortable at night. It is light, slim and easy to live with. The 2,000nit OLED screen is plenty bright for seeing indoors and out, remaining clear to read off-angle, which makes glancing down at the time or notifications easy. It is covered by glass that Apple says is twice as scratch resistant as before, although not as hard as sapphire, which is reserved for the more expensive titanium models. The new watch has the same S10 chip as last year’s model but now supports optional 5G and stronger reception for those times when you’re in the wilderness. The batteries have increased in capacity by 9% and 11% for the 42mm and 46mm watches respectively. The 46mm lasted a good two days in testing with sleep tracking but without exercise. Most people will just about be able to track two days and two nights before needing a charge, which takes 66 minutes using a 20W or greater power adaptor (not included), hitting about 70% in 30 minutes. If you do go out for a run, it will last about eight hours of tracking, which is long enough for a marathon or two. Specifications Case size: 42 or 46mm Case thickness: 9.7mm Weight: about 30g or 37g Processor: S10 Storage: 64GB Operating system: watchOS 26 Water resistance: 50 metres (5ATM) Sensors: HR, ECG, spO2, temp, depth, mic, speaker, NFC, GNSS, compass, altimeter Connectivity: Bluetooth 5.3, wifi 4, NFC, UWB, optional 5G watchOS 26 The Flow watch face is fun but I struggle to read the time at a glance. Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian The Series 11 ships with watchOS 26 , which runs on all models from 2020’s Series 6 and newer. It adds Apple’s new Liquid Glass design, which makes most elements semi-translucent, and adds two new watch faces: a large digital face called Flow that responds to movement and an analogue face called Exactograph, which breaks out hours, minutes and seconds into their own dials. The best new feature is the wrist-flick gesture, where you rapidly twist your wrist away from you and then back to dismiss things and return to the watch face. It works even without raising your wrist to look at the watch, meaning you can dismiss alarms with a satisfying flick of the wrist. Hypertension, sleep and AI workouts Hypertension alerts use the same optical sensor on the back of the watch as used for heart rate and blood oxygen measurement, no pressure cuff required. Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian The Apple Watch features the same comprehensive health monitoring suite of tools from previous models but adds a couple of new features and a redesigned workout app. Hypertension alerts look for signs of high blood pressure over a 30-day period, notifying you to get yourself checked out if your heart rate data suggests you may have a hidden problem. The new sleep score metric makes Apple’s sleep tracking easier to interpret, similar to competitors from Google, Samsung and others. Each morning the watch shows a score out of 100 that is broken down into three categories: duration, bedtime and interruptions, which are all self-explanatory and viewable in the Health app on the iPhone, too. Sleep score makes it easier to understand whether you’re getting good enough sleep at a glance, with more details if you need it. Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian Workout buddy is an AI coach that uses your previous workout data to give you pep talks before and after workouts, such as recognising that you have already run three times this week and the level of effort you put it. It also provides audible heads-up when you reach certain milestones during exercise, such as a particular pace, heart rate, distance, time or other metrics. There is a choice of three voices, which speak to you over Bluetooth headphones connected to your watch for one of 12 activities, including walking, running or cycling. However, it only works if you also carry your iPhone 15 Pro or later with you, which I found irritating enough that I would forgo the feature to avoid being encumbered with a phone on runs. Sustainability The recycled aluminium frame feels high quality, slim and comfortable on your wrist. Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian Apple says the battery should last more than 1,000 full charge cycles with at least 80% of its original capacity and can be replaced for £95 . Repairs cost between £295 and £389 depending on the model. It contains more than 40% recycled material including aluminium, cobalt, copper, glass, gold, lithium, rare earth elements, steel, tin, titanium and tungsten. Apple offers trade-in and free recycling for devices, and breaks down the watch’s environmental impact in its report . Price The Series 11 comes in two sizes (42 and 46mm), a choice of materials and the option of 5G that requires an eSim and compatible phone plan add-on. It starts at £369 (€449/ $399 / A$679 ). The 5G models cost an extra £100 (€120/$100/A$170). For comparison, the Apple Watch Ultra 3 costs £749 , the Apple Watch SE 3 costs from £219 , the Google Pixel Watch 4 costs from £349 and the Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 costs from £294 . Verdict The Series 11 hasn’t changed the winning Apple Watch formula but it has added two things that most will appreciate: more scratch-resistant glass and longer battery life. The slim design, fast charging and two-day battery life make the watch easy to live with, particularly for sleep tracking and use as a silent alarm clock. The wrist-flick gesture is so good every watch should have it, while compatibility with straps and charging pucks for all previous Apple Watches is a great bonus for those upgrading. A price cut in the UK is welcome, too. The glass-like design of watchOS 26 may take some getting used to but the software works just the same and introduces some useful features including hypertension alerts, which could be lifesaving. Workout buddy is the most interesting feature. It was a far more positive experience than I was expecting but relies on working out with your phone, too, which is a bit of a drag for runs. Overall, the Series 11 is one of the very best smartwatches available for the iPhone, and if you have an older watch such as a Series 6 , you will see a massive upgrade. However, this year its status as the default Apple Watch to buy has been challenged by the revamped Watch SE 3, which offers better value if not quite as many features or as refined a design. Pros: great always-on screen, slim design, double-tap and wrist-flick gestures, top health tracking, great activity tracking, workout buddy AI trainer, 50-metre water resistance, two-day battery life, optional 5G, long software support, recycled materials, takes older watch straps. Cons: expensive, only works with an iPhone, no third-party watch faces, looks the same as all recent models, undercut by Watch SE.",https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/oct/06/apple-watch-series-11-review-wrist-flickingly-good-with-longer-battery-life,Technology,BBC,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cf54fc125a373f3700455e4f6bfa6844f7d6d9ff/1664_757_3666_2932/master/3666.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctcmV2aWV3LTUucG5n&enable=upscale&s=255f3aac31916843dfd532331883c677",2025-10-06T06:00:03+00:00,0dbc4f96c23d03bf3a27d519b76f963f7b188709
afa6ac39c323,Sky Glass Air review: a surprisingly good budget smart TV,,"S ky’s latest streaming TV aims to be a good, all-in-one budget option for your sitting room – and it achieves all those aims, leaving it standing strong in a field of mediocre, similarly priced appliances. The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link. Learn more . The Glass Air is a lighter, slimmer and cheaper version of the Glass gen 2 and is arguably the low-cost TV Sky should have launched first, coming in three sizes starting at £309 or just £6 a month on 48-month interest-free credit with £20 upfront. As with its pricier siblings, Glass Air requires a Sky subscription for full use, which costs from £15 a month for the Essential TV pack. It will function as a basic smart TV with streaming apps, an aerial and its three HDMI ports, but you would not buy any Sky TV without the intention of paying for its TV-over-broadband service. Glass Air is best thought of as a cut-down version of Glass gen 2. It has the same service and internal smart hardware but lacks the integrated soundbar, aluminium body and has a different screen, making it a fraction of the weight and thickness. The slim plastic frame is available in a choice of three colours with matching remote. Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian It also means all it needs is a power cable and an internet connection, be that via wifi or ethernet – no aerial or satellite cable required – and just one remote for all of your TV, streaming apps and services combined. It also has Sky’s voice-control system with integrated mics, so you can turn it on, search, control the volume and playback by simply saying “Hello Sky” followed by your command. You have to speak up a bit but it works well. Alternatively, you can press and hold the mic button on the remote and speak into that. The 60Hz screen is a bright and crisp 4K LCD panel with HDR support, but it lacks the superior local-dimming backlight technology present in Glass gen 2 and other higher-end TVs. That means the picture has one brightness across the whole scene, reducing the difference between light and dark areas. As a result, some high-contrast scenes look less dramatic and lack a little depth, while bright landscapes can look a little bleached out. Despite this, the television does a good job of displaying an engaging picture, looking great with everyday TV shows and doing a solid job with bright animation or moody movies. Glass Air has three HDMI ports, an optical port, two USB ports, ethernet and an aerial socket, but only needs power and wifi to actually work. Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian The 15W stereo speakers are surprisingly good for a thin TV without a soundbar. They can get loud enough to fill medium-sized rooms and produced clear vocals at anything up to 90% volume, which can’t be said of most TV speakers. They lack bass and any attempt at surround sound, but are certainly good enough for watching Bargain Hunt or the Premier League. You can use one of the three HDMI ports to connect a soundbar for more immersive sound, although you will need to raise the TV otherwise the soundbar will block a portion of the screen. Sky OS The modern Sky interface puts all of your content, whether live or on-demand, in one easy to use system. Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian One of the biggest advantages of Glass Air compared with similarly priced budget TVs is that the software running on it is actually good. Sky OS has improved dramatically over the last few years and runs well on the Glass Air. It combines live broadcast with on-demand content seamlessly through its excellent playlist feature, which makes keeping track of your shows and films easy. Watching live TV, pausing it and rewinding it works great. Almost every major streaming service is supported, including BBC iPlayer, ITV X, Channel 4, Apple TV+, Prime Video, Disney+, Paramount+ and Discovery+. Glass Air also supports AirPlay 2 for sending content from Apple’s various devices and Bluetooth for connecting a set of headphones for private listening. Sustainability The TV switches to a screensaver before turning off when not used for a set time, detecting your presence through motion sensors in the remote. Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian The television is repairable apart from the screen . It contains recycled plastic and solder. The company will recycle its old products and ships the TV in plastic-free packaging. Price The Sky Glass Air is available in three sizes with upfront costs of £309 for 43in, £509 for 55in and £649 for 65in. It is also available on 24- or 48-month interest-free payment plans costing from £6 with a £20 upfront fee. The minimum required Sky package is Essential TV costing from £15 a month, which includes Netflix and Discovery+, with many other combinations of entertainment, movies, kids and sports channels available on 24 or one month rolling plans. Verdict Sky Glass Air is a solid budget television with all the advantages of Sky’s pay-TV over broadband service built in. It is slim and light with stereo speakers that are far better than most slender TVs. It has a decent 4K picture that is bright and colourful, although it lacks a little contrast here and there. The physical bits of the TV are essentially good enough. Where it trounces other budget rivals is in the service and software, which is miles better than most low-end smart TVs. Of course you have to pay a monthly subscription for the privilege, but for those looking for Sky pay-TV you are not getting a worse software experience on a cheaper television. And it still has the genuinely great all-in-one convenience of every TV and streaming service in one box with one remote and just power and internet required. You can get better-looking mid-range TVs discounted to around this price if you shop savvy. But the Glass Air is great for the money and stands out against the sea of unremarkable budget TVs at this end of the market. Pros: all-in-one streaming and pay-TV device, decent vocals, no satellite/cable or aerial needed, good remote, great software, excellent search and playlist functions, all major streaming apps, voice control, custom picture modes. Cons: no local dimming means lower contrast, no fast refresh rate for game consoles, no Chromecast support, requires subscription. The TV slots on to two metal prongs on a sturdy plastic stand with no tools required or it can be wall-mounted instead.

5037530ad126,Nothing Headphone 1 review: attention-seeking design for your head,,"L ondon-based Nothing’s latest gadget is a set of over-ear headphones that throws out the dull design norms of noise-cancelling cans for an attention-attracting look that is a cross between a 1980s Walkman and Doctor Who’s Cybermen. The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link. Learn more . The large, semi-transparent cans are certainly a statement piece on your head, with an outer design covered in details, dot-matrix print and physical buttons, but sadly stopping short of the flashing LEDs of the company’s phones . The unconventional design has a rather more conventional price, costing £299 and landing the Headphone 1 in competition with the very best noise-cancelling headphones from Bose, Sony, Sennheiser and myriad others. The various dots and details visible through the transparent plastic shell are purely cosmetic. Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian The eye-catching transparent plastic ovals protrude from smooth aluminium squircles to form the ear cups, which are attached to the headband by black steel arms that rotate and tilt to adjust the fit. The headphones are relatively heavy at 329g, but have a well-judged clamping force that keeps them secure on your head without too much pressure. The ear cushions are slim and quite comfortable, if a bit sweaty on warmer days. But the padding on the headband is a little too thin and can create a sore spot on your head after a few hours of listening. The right ear cup has five buttons and two ports dotted around it. The power switch, USB-C and headphones ports are in the bottom edge, with a dedicated Bluetooth pairing button hidden on the inside edge. A rolling button controls volume and presses in for play and pause or to switch noise-cancelling modes. The roller button and paddle are beautifully tactile, making them easy to identify and control while on your head. Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian Below the roller is a paddle that rocks left and right to skip track, fast-forward or rewind. A final button on the outside of the ear cup activates the phone’s voice assistant, but can be customised to other functions such as controlling noise cancelling. It is really nice to have multiple tactile buttons compared with the various touch or single-button controls plaguing most headphones. The battery lasts 30 to 35 hours with noise cancelling, or up to 80 hours with it off, which is in line with the competition and long enough for a week of commuting or any flight. A full charge takes two hours. The headphones support Bluetooth 5.3 and can connect to two devices simultaneously. They also have a standard 3.5mm headphones socket and can play audio over USB-C, which is handy for wired listening with a phone. Specifications Weight: 329g Dimensions: 189.3 x 173.9 x 78mm Drivers: 40mm Connectivity: Bluetooth 5.3 with multipoint, 3.5mm, USB-C charging and audio Bluetooth codecs: SBC, AAC, LDAC Rated battery life: 35 hours ANC on Sound by KEF, noise cancelling by Nothing The memory-foam ear cushions are quite thin but comfortable and provide a good seal for the sound. Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian Nothing partnered with the storied British speaker maker KEF for the audio tuning of the Headphone 1, resulting in some great-sounding headphones. They have a fairly bassy profile, with plenty of punch in the low end without drowning out the mids and high tones. They produce a relatively wide soundstage with solid detail and separation of tones. But they sound best with noise cancelling turned off. Switch it on and they sound narrower and a bit muted in some more complex tracks, lacking a bit of punch here and there. They won’t trouble the very best in the market for high-end nuance but they sound good for general listening across a range of genres. The noise cancelling is similar: reasonably effective but some way behind the best in class. It can handle rumbles and other lower end tones reasonably well. But it really struggles with higher tones such as voices, which are clearly audible even with noise cancelling set to maximum, making them a poor choice for trying to focus in an office or cafe. The transparency mode sounds clear and natural but is a bit too loud, increasing the volume of world around you unnecessarily. It is great for awareness, but can overwhelm the music. Call quality is good, coming through nice and clear in quiet or noisy street environments. The excellent Nothing X app on Android or iPhone handles settings, updates and has a full equaliser. It can be used to turn on some good spatial audio with or without head tracking to add a bit of space and realism for movies. Sustainability The physical switch for power feels good next to the USB-C and 3.5mm headphones ports. Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian The headphones are generally repairable with replacement ear cushions available from customer service, but they are not made with any recycled materials. Price The Nothing Headphone 1 cost £299 (€299/ $299 / A$549 ) and come in white or black. For comparison, the Sony WH-1000XM6 cost £399 , the Bose QuietComfort Ultra cost £350 , the Sonos Ace cost £399 , the Beats Studio Pro cost £350 , the Sennheiser Momentum 4 Wireless cost £199 and the Fairbuds XL cost £219 . Verdict The Nothing Headphones 1 stand out above the very samey-looking crowd of noise-cancelling headphones. But that overt design draws more attention on the street than I would like, particularly in white as tested. They do sound pretty good, but their noise-cancelling performance falls short of rivals’ at this price. As does the comfort with the headband lacking enough padding for really long listening sessions. Solid battery life, great connectivity and a quality app make the headphones easy to live with. It is nice to have multiple physical buttons for the playback and other controls too. At £300 or equivalent you can easily get a better combination of sound, noise cancelling and comfort from leading rivals. That means, even more so than with the company’s phones , you have to really want something to make you look different to choose these headphones. Pros: standout design, great button controls, good sound, noise cancelling, good app for Android and iPhone, good spatial audio, 3.5mm and USB-C audio, Bluetooth multipoint, decent case. Cons: headband padding a bit thin, relatively heavy, do not fold up for travel, average noise cancelling, attract quite a lot of attention, expensive. The headphones rotate to flat but do not fold up for storage and travel, making their case relatively large.

cc8c49344d0c,"Meet Anamanaguchi, the band behind the last Scott Pilgrim video game’s soundtrack – and the next one",,"S cott Pilgrim, the series of pop culture-saturated graphic novels by Canadian author and comic book artist Bryan Lee O’Malley, has become a timeless epic about teenage insecurity, love and redemption, and the intersection of arrogance and self-esteem – as well as a Canadian interpretation of emo, indie rock and shōnen-style comic books. It is a coming-of-age tale about an initially unlikable teenage boy growing up in the 00s, who matures through six graphic novels that deftly reference everything from Japanese manga to western superheroes, video games and Tintin. It is also, of course, a hit movie , a 2022 Netflix anime series , and a 2010 video game – the last two of which were soundtracked by New York City-based indie rock band Anamanaguchi. ‘My favourite scene in the Scott Pilgrim anime is where Knives and Kim are just jamming in a room together, and almost nothing happens,” laughs Peter Berkman, one of the lead songwriters and guitarists in the band. “It’s just one of those slice-of-life moments where you remember why you love music in the first place. It really struck a chord with me. No pun intended.” Sex Bob-Omb in Netflix’s Scott Pilgrim Takes Off. Photograph: Album/Alamy Anamanaguchi gained some notoriety for using video game hardware in their early, instrumental music, becoming one of the pioneering bands in the chiptune genre – all while they were still at college. During the band’s first self-funded tour, during which Berkman slept on the couch of the band he was supporting, he got amessage out of nowhere. “I got an email from somebody working at Ubisoft about a video game for a universal IP tie-in, and they didn’t go any further than that. ‘Could that be the new Alien vs Predator game or something like that?’, I thought. But I knew that – no matter what – when I brought that back to the band, we would say yes to whatever it was … we had all grown up loving video game and movie soundtracks.” It turned out to be an invitation to compose music for the first Scott Pilgrim video game, which was released in 2010. Now, Anamanaguchi is in the midst of a renaissance: in 2022, when the game was re-released as a Complete Edition, the band embarked on the Scott Pilgrim vs the World: The Game Soundtrack tour. Last year, the band wrote and performed music for Scott Pilgrim Takes Off, a Netflix spin-off that acts as a meta commentary on Scott’s life. Anamanaguchi supported Hatsune Miku in her Fortnite festival appearance this year, a perfect fit for a band whose identity has always rested at the intersection of video games and live music, and in August, they launched Anyway, their first record in six years, which trades in the band’s synth-based bleeps and blorps for something decidedly more alt-rock, though the 8-bit influences of its members still remain if you listen hard enough. And they’re also working on the soundtrack for a new Scott Pilgrim game, due out next year, another playful beat-’em-up. skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Pushing Buttons Keza MacDonald's weekly look at the world of gaming Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Photograph: Gary Miller/Getty Images As one arm of the band experiments with analogue sounds and alt-rock angst, the other is moving back to Scott Pilgrim. There is a direct link between Anamanaguchi’s return to the series and the new voice they’ve found on their records. “Doing the soundtrack for the new game, Scott Pilgrim EX, allowed us to see what it would be like to dampen that aspect in our own record world, knowing that we were going full in, soundtrack-style, on the game,” says Berkman. Berkman says that in the 15 years between games, the band have matured when it comes to their approach to music. They have gained experience as producers, they have grown “as listeners of music”, and they have become even more excited by the range of styles that video game music represents. “You need to feel that connection between what you’re experiencing as a player and - even in a beat-em-up! - what the story is trying to do at that moment,” says Berkman. “If a situation calls for a dark, gothic industrial thing, we can make that happen – and we can make it happen in a way it never has before… [Scott PilgrimEX developer Tribute Games] has let us be a hands-on with the audio mix. and with the musical cues we want. That freedom is extremely important to us. The flow of the music, the way it makes you feel… you can really feel the authorship in video game soundtracks.” On the beach in Scott Pilgrim EX. Photograph: Tribute Games Inc Having played a demo of Scott Pilgrim EX, it seems that Tribute Games’ trust in the band has paid off. The music is playful and toys with convention, setting up prompts or expectations, only to surprise you with how sound effects or motifs become part of a level’s texture. It actually reminds me of Sea Power’s work on Disco Elysium, strange as that comparison may seem to anyone who knows their music. Sea Power were given lot of creative control in adapting their sound to fit the morose world of Revachol, and Tribute Games has done the same here, even if the with pixel art, neon colours, and buoyant adolescence of it all deliver a completely different tone. “Tribute Games has given us a level of freedom that can only be matched by a company just … not knowing what you’re doing,” laughs Berkman. “We’ve been able to be a part of the development process in a way that we weren’t in the last time, you know?

cfe0e218052c,What the Xbox Game Pass price hike says about the rising cost of playing games,,"I n the music, TV and film industries, streaming has completely upended the business model. Instead of buying albums and films, most of us pay for a few subscriptions depending on what we want to watch, and maybe supplement that with the odd vinyl or special-edition Blu-ray. This has been pretty terrible for musicians, who earn approximately $0.004 per play on Spotify, while Spotify itself made $1bn in profit last year (admittedly after many years of operating losses). On the TV front, it’s increasingly annoying for customers: in my household we have to carefully bounce around between five different TV subscriptions depending on what series we’re into, to keep costs down. This model hasn’t really caught on in video games. Apple has its Arcade service that offers premium mobile games for £6.99 a month, but free-to-play games are the norm on phones and tablets and make gigantic profits through ads and in-game purchases. (Fun fact: around 85% of all revenue in the entire games industry comes from free-to-play games, mostly in territories such as China.) Netflix packages games as part of its subscription, but not very many people play them . PlayStation and Nintendo both have subscription services, but they only include older games, rather than brand new ones. And then there’s Game Pass, the Xbox subscription service, which has offered a library of 200+ games including all of Xbox’s brand new exclusives for an eyebrow-raisingly generous price. Until now. Microsoft recently announced that a Game Pass Ultimate subscription was going up from £14.99 to £22.99 a month. (This is the version that includes all the latest releases – cheaper options remain available). And while subscribers in some countries (mostly in Europe) received an email last night delaying the price hike, subscribers in the UK and US will still pay more. The hike has seemed inevitable for some time; nobody could quite figure out the economics of Game Pass given that blockbuster games cost hundreds of millions to make, and Microsoft has also been paying other developers to host their games on its service. Bloomberg estimates that putting Call of Duty on Game Pass last year cost Microsoft the equivalent of $300m in sales. Does this suggest that Game Pass is not proving as successful as Microsoft would like? I asked Christopher Dring of The Game Business newsletter for his very informed opinion. “Game Pass is profitable,” he says. “But it’s clearly had an impact on the premium sales of games. It’s most notable with games like Halo Infinite and Starfield not charting as highly as you’d expect … Xbox bought Activision Blizzard for $70bn. That comes with scrutiny from the heads of Microsoft, including chief financial officer Amy Hood. It’s not just about profitability, it’s about growth – Microsoft expects a strong return from its Xbox division for that kind of investment. Not to over simplify things, but that’s why Xbox has been cutting costs, projects and even studios, and why it’s raising prices across the board.” Xbox will be relying on Game Pass for growth, because its actual console sales have been in freefall for years. Microsoft stopped reporting how many Xboxes it was shifting, preferring instead to talk about revenue and engagement, but it is estimated that the Xbox Series S/X has sold a few million less than 2013’s Xbox One, putting it in distant third place behind Nintendo and PlayStation. Xbox’s own executives have said that console sales aren’t a priority: that’s why Microsoft has started putting all its games on PC and PlayStation, too, and why it’s been investing so heavily in buying up studios to make content for Game Pass. A promotional image of Call of Duty Warzone. Photograph: Activision But here’s the bigger picture: do we even want a subscription-based future for video games? And what does it mean for developers? One possible future follows the pattern of the TV industry: prices creep up, streaming services proliferate and gamers have no choice but to pay a fortune every year to play the latest titles. Meanwhile, developers will find it increasingly difficult to make the money needed to support big titles as direct sales dry up, forcing a consolidation of talent – which ultimately makes it harder and harder for original art to emerge. Millions of gamers are still happy to pay £70 for games on release day: Mario Kart World and Assassin’s Creed Shadows were two of the bestselling games in Europe in the first half of this year. Why would the big players seek to undermine that? “For [smaller] developers, it comes down to whether you’re in it or not,” reckons Dring. “Right now, Game Pass is a strong discoverability tool in an era where that is a real industry issue. It’s also a way for players to access games at an affordable cost (well, it used to be), which in the current economy is important. But there are concerns for what the future might hold.” Different business models can coexist, of course. In video games, free-to-play now coexists with premium games: they largely serve different audiences, and the data suggests that they do not cannibalise each other. Some people prefer to buy high-end consoles and high-end titles, and that market has remained pretty stable for the past decade; many more people engage casually with free-to-play games, a market that has been growing hugely, and has massively increased the overall gaming audience along with it. It’s possible that subscription services like Game Pass – if managed well – could offer an in-between option that doesn’t completely ruin the entire industry’s business model. But given the precedent elsewhere in the arts, and the rapacious hunger for profit and growth of big corporations like Microsoft , maybe that is overly optimistic. Despite the price rise, Xbox Game Pass still represents good value for the most time-rich customers. “Xbox is asking its biggest players, those who engage the most, to pay more. That’s who Game Pass Ultimate is for,” Dring points out. “I suspect a large number of these players will accept it, if they can afford it, because, according to statistics, they get good value out of it. The average Game Pass Ultimate player plays $550 worth of games a year.” Editor’s note : due to an editing error, last week’s edition referred to the new Nintendo of America president Devon Pritchard as “he” when she is in fact the first woman to hold the position. Apologies to Devon, and thanks to the people who wrote in to point this out. What to play Baby Steps. Photograph: Devolver Digital There were so many good games in September that I’m still catching up with them (and I’m still very much stuck in Silksong’s web). Enter Baby Steps , a surreal slapstick comedy game that I’ve been looking forward to forever . It opens promisingly, as pathetic man-child Nate is zapped from his parents’ basement to a bewildering wilderness hike for which he is woefully unprepared; using the triggers to lift his pallid feet and the control stick to lean his weight, you stumble out of a cave and up to a camp at the foot of a mountain. What follows, though, is one of the most painful gaming experiences you’ll ever have, as you slip and flounder and slide down sections of terrain that you already spent twenty minutes trying to climb. I misplaced one of Nate’s feet on a wooden beam across a gap and tumbled so far down that it took me several minutes to even make it back to the campsite I’d started at an hour before. And yet! I still stayed up until 2am playing this because it’s extremely weird and funny and obstinate, and because I finally feel like I’m getting somewhere with controlling Nate’s useless body. It’s a real “suffer for your art” situation but if you’re into novel suffering, give it a try. Available on: PS5, PC Estimated playtime: 10 hours What to read EA headquarters.

We’ve found it’s been invested in vanity mega projects inside and outside of the country … We see this as a deliberate attempt to distract from the country’s human rights abuses.” My household’s summer obsession was the Netflix animated film Kpop Demon Hunters (iykyk), a movie so explosively popular that it is now taking over Fortnite with new modes and character cosmetics. This has sparked an interesting debate between me and my partner: he does not want our still-quite-young kids engaging with Fortnite at all; I am willing to overlook it because of how delighted they will be by it. Either way, I will be playing it. Pour one out for Rock Band , the once popular plastic-instrument game that soundtracked my uni days. Its last instalment, Rock Band 4, was delisted from stores last Sunday on its 10th anniversary, as the music licenses for its songs expired. If you own the game, there’s still time to bulk up your library of tracks before they are all removed from sale. Now that developer Harmonix is making music for Fortnite instead , we’ll certainly never see another Rock Band game. skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Pushing Buttons Keza MacDonald's weekly look at the world of gaming Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

bb63d7b762ad,Cold war power play: how the Stasi got into computer games,,"I n 2019 researchers at Berlin’s Computer Games Museum made an extraordinary discovery: a rudimentary Pong console, made from salvaged electronics and plastic soap-box enclosures for joysticks. The beige rectangular tupperware that contained its wires would, when connected to a TV by the aerial, bring a serviceable Pong copy to the screen. Arcade fire … East German attractions at ColdWarGames. Photograph: Dora Csala/AlliiertenMuseum At the time, they thought the home-brewed device was a singular example of ingenuity behind the iron curtain. But earlier this year they found another Seifendosen-Pong ( “soap-box Pong”), along with a copy of a state-produced magazine called FunkAmateur containing schematics for a DIY variety of Atari’s 1970s gaming sensation. The discovery rubbed up against received wisdom that the dawn of computer gaming had at best been tolerated and at worst suppressed by socialist East Germany . Instead, here was evidence that gaming enjoyed a level of official support, including from the regime’s notorious secret service. A new joint exhibit from the Allied Museum and the Computer Games Museum in Berlin brings cold war gaming curios from both sides of the iron curtain to light, including East Germany’s only arcade cabinet, the Poly-Play, which visitors can try out. With honey-coloured wooden panels and a brightly lit typeface, only 2,000 of the machines were made. In the late 80s, adolescents would crowd the cabinets at youth clubs and holiday retreats, to the extent they were available, where they could play a number of games cloned from western originals. But the Poly-Play “was only possible with help from state security,” says Veit Lehmann of the Allied Museum. Lacking programming expertise and manpower, manufacturer VEB Polytechnick turned to the Stasi for help. They were the ones with “the experts and the computing capability” to code the games. Instead of Pac–Man, there was Hase und Wolf – a canine-dodging hare swapped for Namco’s famous cheese-wheel-shaped ghost-evader. There was Hirschjagd (“Deer Hunt”), a repackaged take on the sci-fi shooter Robotron: 2084 . There was Schießbude , a copy of a carnival shooting game; a butterfly-collecting title called Schmetterling ; a memory puzzler; a skiing game and a racing game among the rest. Tamed … the Poly-Play Hase und Wolf (Hare and Wolf) game. Photograph: VEB Polytechnik Karl-Marx-Stadt The Poly-Play was many East Germans’ first encounter with computers, and it “opened up a completely different world for them”, says Regina Seiwald at the University of Birmingham. “The Poly-Play was seen as a machine for the whole family, who’d enjoy a weekend, go for a walk and then jointly play on one. It was seen as an innocent pastime, but with a bit of technical skills training added in.” But, as arcade-goers in the west commandeered tanks in Battlezone or blasted dragons from jetpack-propelled gunners in Space Harrier, the Poly-Play had all notions of violence removed. The GDR liked to present itself as an idyllic, peace-loving state, and its media law deemed all forms of “calls to violence” unconstitutional. “The GDR’s attitude towards computers was an idea of a harmonic self-image and a fear of the unknown,” Seiwald says. Yet, away from the Poly-Play and its PG approach to gaming, self-described “freaks” gathered at computer clubs to test the tolerance of the police state. The east declared technology an economic priority in the late 1970s but, with the CoCom trade embargo blocking exports to the socialist bloc, western technology was only available through smuggling routes, with ZX Spectrums sewn into car seats or hidden in chocolate boxes for cross-border journeys. Long arm of the state … an exhibit at ColdWarGames. Photograph: Wikimedia Commons State factories did produce their own machines – such as the Bildschirmspiel 01 pong clone and the VEB Robotron series of microcomputers – but only in small numbers. High price tags made them unattainable for most. As early enthusiasts began to establish clubs at universities and youth centres from Berlin to Dresden and Leipzig, the state wondered if this youthful interest could help carve a path out of its technical quandary. “They thought if young people spent their time with games and computers, they might develop something better,” says Lehmann. Perhaps, the state thought, this interest could stir new generations into careers in microelectronics, where they might develop much-needed homegrown chips. An oft-repeated phrase among GDR officials, adds Martin Görlich, managing director of the Computer Games Museum, was that “learning from the Soviet Union means learning how to win”. So embracing computing echoed the position of the USSR, which also had arcade games – Frankenstein-like hybrids that blended physical action with screens – and ran its own computer clubs. Eastern blocks … ColdWarGames. Photograph: Dora Csala/AlliiertenMuseum Of course, the USSR also gave birth to Tetris , the fast-paced puzzler designed by software engineer Alexey Pajitnov to test a new computer. (The game was initially traded between engineers, but led to a dramatic race to secure distribution rights from the Soviet Union between Dutch-born game designer Henk Rogers and Kevin Maxwell, son of disgraced media mogul Robert Maxwell.) Over in East Germany, citizens often relied on bootlegs to get around restrictions or shortages. Would-be fashionistas stitched their own clothes, musicians cobbled together audio equipment, and enterprising sorts hand-painted banned board games such as Monopoly, with Mayfair swapped for Karl-Marx-Allee and a party conference square taking the place of jail. A DIY approach to computing was thus in keeping with the state’s policy of self-reliance, where civilians were encouraged to knit, build, tinker and repair all they could. Official magazines such as FunkAmateur and Jugend und Technik responded by promoting games – which they called “computer sports” – and publishing programming code. “The GDR was very aware of the constraints it had in technology,” says Seiwald. “People educating themselves in technology, or pushing the boundaries of what was available, was viewed positively.” Tantalisingly for young hobbyists, some of the computer clubs, such as the House of Young Talents in east Berlin, possessed much-desired Commodore 64 machines, which were far superior to the GDR’s domestic equivalents. Most club attendees were young and male and, unsurprisingly, interested in games above all else. Some learned to code their own games on state computers such as the KC 85 by VEB Mikroelektronik, while others played them, such as René Meyer, who was 16 when he was introduced to a computer club at the University of Leipzig. “The GDR’s home computers were not compatible with other systems, creating a unique ecosystem for computing in the east,” says Meyer, whose favourite game was Bennion Geppy, its hero tasked with traversing dungeon rooms, dodging monsters and collecting keys. Paradoxically, while the state seemed to support these groups – club-goers were sometimes rewarded with fast-tracked routes to engineering colleges – they were also infiltrated by Stasi informants and closely monitored, their computing activities regarded with suspicion. One report from the Stasi archive lists all the games in circulation at the House of Young Talent. Next to acceptable titles such as Superbowl and Samantha Fox Strip Poker, games such as Rambo and Stryker were singled out for their glorification of violence. Later, as internal conflicts within East German society intensified, the Stasi grew more paranoid about war-themed games, computer viruses and anti-socialist messaging in software. Perhaps their fears weren’t unfounded: in neighbouring Czechoslovakia, underground gamers programmed titles such as The Adventures of Indiana Jones in Wenceslas Square, a text adventure where the fedora-decked explorer could meet a grisly fate at the hands of bloodthirsty police officers. The east wasn’t alone in its mistrust of technology. In 1984, West Germany banned children from playing arcade games, concerned that they encouraged gambling. Then, it introduced strict age-gating for supposedly violent games, such as the Activision title, River Raid. This suspicion around gaming extends well into the 21st century: publishers have had to alter the content of their titles to get around censor boards. Players of the German version of Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2, for example, were punished with failure if they shot civilians in its notorious ‘No Russian’ mission , where terrorists massacred travellers at a Moscow airport. While East Germany promoted decentralised computing, over in the west, the state held a firm monopoly on telecoms, criminalising home networking and especially hacking. In the 1980s, activists in West Germany responded by founding the Chaos Computer Club, which continues to this day, even creating a DIY modem from toilet pipes in protest: the Datenklo (“dataloo”). “The west was very harsh in punishing hackers and crackers,” says Seiwald. “That the GDR was more permissive surprises a lot of people.”",https://www.theguardian.com/games/2025/oct/07/stasi-coldwargames-its-all-a-game-alliiertenmuseum-berlin,Technology,BBC,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e55bbe3cf278165028074bb44516391cb86b3588/0_172_4410_3528/master/4410.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=dc7de8b3d6937420070afafbadd6499e",2025-10-07T14:56:07+00:00,17c4a7a08830c2e42e8d631433566a2cb5ac2045
863772514e28,Proof-of-age ID leaked in Discord data breach,,"Video game chat platform Discord has suffered a data breach, informing users that their personal information – including identity documents of those required to prove their age – were compromised. The company stated last week that an unauthorised party had compromised one of Discord’s third-party customer service providers, leading to the access of “a limited number of users” who had been in contact with the customer service or trust and safety teams. The data compromised may have included usernames, email, billing information, the last four digits of credit card numbers, IP addresses and messages with customer support. Discord said the alleged attacker “also gained access to a small number of government ID images (eg driving licence, passport) from users who had appealed an age determination. Affected users were in the process of being notified as of last week. “If your ID may have been accessed, that will be specified in the email you receive,” Discord said. The support system was targeted to access user data with a view to extort a financial ransom from Discord, the company stated. Discord said it revoked the third-party provider’s access to its ticketing system and launched an internal investigation, including engaging with law enforcement. The attack appears to have occurred on 20 September , according to a user who received a notification. Discord has said it has over 200m active monthly users. Discord began using facial age assurance to check the age for users in the UK and Australia earlier this year . The company said facial images and ID images “are deleted directly after” ages are confirmed, but Discord’s website noted that if verification fails, users can contact the trust and safety team for a manual review. Under the under 16s social media ban to come into effect on 10 December, the Australian government has outlined that it expects platforms such as Discord – which is one of the platforms that has been asked to assess if it is required to comply – should have multiple options for assessing a user’s age, and a way for them to quickly appeal an adverse decision . Platforms can ask for ID documents as part of the age assurance scheme, but it cannot be the sole method of age assurance offered by the platforms under the policy.

ad97e5dbf489,Nobel prize in chemistry awarded to scientists for work on ‘Hermione’s handbag’,,"The Nobel prize in chemistry has been awarded to three scientists who created revolutionary porous materials that can harvest water from desert air, capture carbon dioxide from industrial facilities and remove toxins from water. Susumu Kitagawa, of Kyoto University, Richard Robson, of the University of Melbourne, and Omar Yaghi, of the University of California, Berkeley, shared the 11m Swedish kronor (about £871,400) prize awarded by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences in Stockholm. The trio found ways to combine metal ions and organic molecules into highly porous structures through which liquids and gases could flow. Tens of thousands of such materials have since been made for applications ranging from storing hydrogen to removing forever chemicals from water and recovering valuable rare earth metals from waste. The scientists were honoured “for the development of metal-organic frameworks”, or MOFs, which have such potential that they have been called the material of the 21st century. Speaking at the prize announcement, Prof Heiner Linke, the chair of the Nobel committee for chemistry, said: “They have found ways to create materials, entirely novel materials with large cavities on the inside, which can be seen almost like rooms in a hotel, so that guest molecules can enter and also exit again from the same material. “A small amount of such material can be almost like Hermione’s handbag in Harry Potter. It can store huge amounts of gas in a tiny volume.” The Nobel prize committee announce the winners, from left Susumu Kitagawa, Richard Robson and Omar Yaghi Photograph: Anadolu/Getty Images The research began in 1989 with Robson, a chemist born in Glusburn, West Yorkshire, who moved to Australia after studying at Oxford and Stanford universities. Inspired by the structure of diamonds, he combined copper ions with a four-armed molecule to make pyramid-shaped molecules. These bonded together to form crystals strewn with cavities. Robson realised the potential for the structures but they were unstable and tended to fall apart. It took further work from Kitagawa and Yaghi to turn metal-organic frameworks into the valuable materials they are today. Kitagawa showed that similar structures based on cobalt, nickel and zinc were not only stable but could be used to store and release methane, nitrogen and oxygen. He went on to show that MOFs could be tailored to different tasks and even made from flexible materials. Reached by the Nobel committee, Kitagawa said he was “deeply honoured and delighted” to receive the prize. Asked about his hopes for the future, Kitagawa said he wanted to use MOFs to extract important elements such as carbon and oxygen from the air and with green energy turn them into useful materials. “This is my dream,” he said. Yaghi became fascinated with chemistry at the age of 10 after sneaking into the school library, which was usually locked, and plucking a book at random from the shelves. He was brought up with his siblings in a single room in Amman, Jordan, with no running water or electricity. At his father’s insistence he went to study in the US. Frustrated with the traditional way of building new molecular structures, Yaghi developed a more precise approach that was more like assembling pieces of Lego into large crystals. In the 1990s, he revealed MOFs that resembled nets held together with copper or cobalt. Later, he created an extraordinary zinc-based MOF. A couple of grams held an area as large as a football pitch, meaning it could absorb a vast amount of gas for its size. Dr Becky Greenaway, a chemist at Imperial College London, said: “Lots of chemists have been wondering when metal-organic frameworks would get the Nobel prize, and it’s finally happened. “Their discovery has enabled a whole range of applications, from gas storage and separations to drug delivery, and also opened up other areas, including porous liquids – liquids with holes in – which are showing promise in carbon capture and catalysis.”",https://www.theguardian.com/science/2025/oct/08/nobel-prize-in-chemistry-awarded-to-scientists-for-work-on-porous-materials,Science,BBC,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e90deb47fb97cd423ae186684629bcdf43da5c15/372_0_4993_3994/master/4993.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=b9b744da47883676edf9b0b1be669523",2025-10-08T13:34:12+00:00,87f5bb27d56f25e08583363428cfef8e9f138537
cb36a79bde4e,The plastic inside us: how microplastics may be reshaping our bodies and minds,,"M icroplastics have been found almost everywhere: in blood, placentas, lungs – even the human brain . One study estimated our cerebral organs alone may contain 5g of the stuff, or roughly a teaspoon. If true, plastic isn’t just wrapped around our food or woven into our clothes: it is lodged deep inside us. Now, researchers suspect these particles may also be meddling with our gut microbes. When Dr Christian Pacher-Deutsch at the University of Graz in Austria exposed gut bacteria from five healthy volunteers to five common microplastics, the bacterial populations shifted – along with the chemicals they produced. Some of these changes mirrored patterns linked to depression and colorectal cancer. “While it’s too early to make definitive health claims, the microbiome plays a central role in many aspects of wellbeing, from digestion to mental health,” says Pacher-Deutsch, who presented his work at the recent United European Gastroenterology conference in Berlin. “Reducing microplastic exposure where possible is therefore a wise and important precaution.” Such discoveries raise unsettling questions: how much plastic do we each carry, does it really matter and can we do anything about it? Microplastics are shed from packaging, clothes , paints, cosmetics, car tyres and other items. Some are tiny enough to slip through the linings of our lungs and guts into our blood and internal organs – even into our cells. What happens next is still largely unknown. Microplastics come in different types and shapes, which may influence their harmful effect. Photograph: Maxshoto/Alamy “Designing a definitive experiment is hard, because we’re constantly being exposed to these particles,” says Dr Jaime Ross , a neuroscientist at the University of Rhode Island in the US. “But we know microplastics are in almost every tissue that has been looked at, and recent studies suggest we’re accumulating far more plastic now than 20 years ago.” Ross first grew curious about plastics as a teenager, watching her mother’s spaghetti-sauce containers corrode. “Many of us assumed plastic was inert – that it wouldn’t shed or react – but I realised it wasn’t,” she says. Fast-forward several decades and she began studying what microplastics might be doing to the mammalian brain. Her first study, published in 2023 , offered a hint: mice drinking water laced with microplastic particles started behaving differently. Usually, if you place mice in a brightly lit box, they hug the walls defensively. But those exposed to plastics restlessly ventured into the open – a behaviour more often seen with ageing and neurological disease. When the mice were dissected, plastic was found in every organ, including the brain, where a key protein linked to brain health, GFAP, was depleted – mirroring a pattern seen in depression and dementia. Since then, human studies have added to the unease. Microplastics have been detected in the brains of dementia patients , and in arterial plaques from people with heart disease. Those with plastic-laden plaques were almost five times more likely to suffer a stroke, heart attack or die within three years. Such findings gave me pause. Like Ross, I’d long assumed plastics were harmless, thinking little of chewing ballpoint pen ends, wearing synthetic clothes and reheating leftovers in takeaway containers. So when I heard about a £144 test from Plastictox promising to reveal how many microplastics were circulating in my blood, I pricked my finger and sent off a drop. We just have to understand whether there’s anything about these particles that makes them disproportionately harmful Alan Morrison, the chief executive of Arrow Lab Solutions , the US company behind the test, said its goal was to provide people with an estimate of their microplastic exposure, allowing them to make lifestyle changes if they wished. “Sometimes this test is the kick in the butt that they need to get some of this [plastic] stuff out of their house and reduce their exposure,” he says. My test detected four microscopic particles – equivalent to about 40 per millilitre of blood. Based on their size, one probably got there through my gut while the other three were likely inhaled, the lab said. Although this places me in the lowest quarter of the 4,000-odd tests it has done so far, “it still represents about 200,000 plastic particles in your bloodstream”, Morrison says. “But considering the average person has over a million, you’re doing comparatively well.” Yet, as other experts point out, no one really knows what a “safe” level of microplastic looks like. The research field is extremely young and consumer tests are “very premature”, says Prof Stephanie Wright , a microplastics researcher at Imperial College London: “Your test results suggest you’ve got 40 particles per ml of blood – but we don’t know if that’s bad or good, what type of plastic, where they’ve come from, what they’re doing or where they’re going.” Scientific studies have used a variety of methods, making comparisons between them difficult. Some techniques – including the one used to quantify microplastics in human studies of dementia and heart disease – can suffer from interference from biological tissues. Because of this, their results are far from conclusive and should “be taken with a pinch of salt”, Wright says. Even if it is possible to accurately quantify the particles in blood or other tissues, it is uncertain whether all microplastics pose the same level of risk. “Plastics are quite heterogeneous. There are different types, but they also have different shapes, which may influence their harmful effects,” says Dr Vahitha Abdul Salam at Queen Mary University of London. The size of the particles also matters; the smaller they are, the more likely they are to cross biological barriers into organs or cells. The Plastictox blood test showed that Linda Geddes scored low for plastic particles – but there were still about 200,000 in her bloodstream. Photograph: Adrian Sherratt/The Guardian There are further challenges before we know for sure if microplastics are harming us: rodent studies may not translate to humans; because they’re so much smaller, the same-sized plastic particles may be taken up and processed very differently, says Salam. So where does that leave us? We’re continually exposed to these particles, and “historically, we know that exposure to too many particles is bad”, says Wright, pointing to air pollution as an example. “We just have to understand whether there’s anything about these particles that makes them disproportionately harmful.” Another pressing question is whether some subjects might be more vulnerable than others. A recent follow-up study by Ross suggested that mice carrying the Alzheimer’s-associated APOE4 gene experienced more severe cognitive decline in response to microplastic exposure than those with less risky genes. skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Detox Your Kitchen A seven-week expert course to help you avoid chemicals in your food and groceries.

If there’s a silver lining, it’s that although research suggests levels of microplastics in our bodies appear to have sharply risen in recent years , older people don’t seem to contain more than younger ones. “I found that positive, because it tells me we might be able to get them out of our bodies,” says Ross. Identifying ways to expedite this natural process – if it exists – is likely to be a significant research focus in the coming years. As for me, I can’t unsee those 200,000-odd particles. Whether or not that figure is accurate, it’s hard not to look around my plastic-coated life and wonder how I might start to unwrap it. Reheating leftovers in glass instead of plastic is a good place to start. And I’ll definitely stop chewing ballpoint pens. How to reduce your exposure Although it is impossible to avoid microplastics entirely, scientists say there are practical ways to reduce your personal exposure. Start in the kitchen. “The thing you definitely want to avoid is heat with plastic,” says Ross. “So not cooking your food with plastic utensils, not putting hot beverages or food into plastic.” Avoid microplastics getting into food by using a wooden rather than a plastic chopping board. Photograph: fotostorm/Getty Images/iStockphoto Salam says she has stopped microwaving food in plastic containers: “When you expose plastic polymers to heat or direct sunlight, this is what transforms or degrades them into microplastics.” Ross suggests examining everyday rituals such as making a cup of tea or chopping onions: “Teabags can release a lot of nano and microplastics. Even if the teabag is paper, they can be sealed with a plastic glue, so perhaps try loose-leaf tea. Are you cutting on a plastic board? Because this could also contaminate food.” Opt for glass or stainless-steel containers, utensils and coffee ware, and use wooden chopping boards instead. Although tap water contains some microplastics, UK tap water is treated to remove almost all of them and studies suggest that many brands of bottled water contain far more. Beyond the kitchen, Ross recommends thinking about bedding and personal care products. “Try to have more natural fibres, especially for the things you’re sleeping in – bed sheets, blankets and pillows, because you can inhale nano and microplastics,” she says. Check the labels on personal care products and cosmetics: although plastic microbeads in, for example, face washes, are now banned, some cosmetics and items such as lotions, lipsticks and eyeshadows may still contain nano or microplastics under names such as polyethylene, polypropylene, polyurethane or acrylates. Also look out for hidden plastics in menstrual products, and opt for those made from 100% cotton or silicone cups. Airborne plastics are another concern. Although indoor environments generally have higher levels owing to synthetic textiles and furnishings, “tyre-wear from high-traffic environments is another source of microplastics exposure”, says Wright. “In the same way that you’d avoid air pollution by walking down quiet streets, trying not to walk next to traffic and having your windows closed in the car. This should theoretically minimise exposure to microplastics.” Finally, think about your environmental footprint. Plastics tossed into landfill will slowly degrade, shedding more microplastics. “If you have any plastic items in your house, like plastic containers, repurpose them to store sewing materials and other non-food items,” says Ross. “If you put them in the recycling, they may not get recycled and you’re just adding to the wider problem.”",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/oct/12/plastic-inside-us-microplastics-reshaping-bodies-minds,Science,BBC,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f771789968b21b0dfcfff8c14f7945ad9e1d1257/688_0_6880_5504/master/6880.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=15f88a9fdc285c08609c3a8ec0d4baee",2025-10-12T05:00:45+00:00,2a7e92c60c231fc34a33ac4a64d433fd61e8f16a
870c1eaf32ff,"Grisly recording reveals bat catching, killing and eating robin mid-flight",,"Bats are generally viewed as harmless, if spooky, creatures of the night. But scientists have revealed a more savage side, after witnessing a greater noctule bat – Europe’s largest bat species – hunting, killing and devouring a robin mid-flight. The grisly recording reveals the bat as a formidable predator, climbing to 1.2km (4,000ft) before embarking on a breakneck-speed dive in pursuit of its prey. On capture, the bat delivered a lethal bite and subsequent chewing sounds, recorded between echolocation calls, indicated that the bat consumed the bird continuously during flight for 23 minutes without losing altitude. “It’s fascinating that bats are not only able to catch them, but also to kill and eat them while flying,” said Dr Laura Stidsholt, a co-author of the research based at Aarhus University. “A bird like that weighs about half as much as the bat itself – it would be like me catching and eating a 35-kilo animal while jogging.” Billions of birds seasonally migrate at night and over long distances at high altitude and their flight paths are known to intersect with bat hunting grounds. Dr Carlos Ibáñez, of the Doñana Biological Station, Seville, first made the case that birds were an important food resource during the pre-hibernation – autumn – and gestation – spring – periods after observing feathers in bat faeces 25 years ago. Other scientists were sceptical, however, and in the intervening years Ibáñez and colleagues have deployed surveillance cameras, military radar and ultrasound recorders attached to hot air balloons in a quest for smoking gun evidence. In the latest study, greater noctule bats were taken from nesting boxes in southern Spain and fitted with tiny “backpacks” containing instruments to record acceleration, altitude and audio, including echolocation calls. The data revealed two instances of bats mounting attacks on migratory birds, one of which was successful. This bat was observed to climb to an altitude of 1.2km, before encountering its prey. “The bat is flying in stealth mode,” said Stidsholt. “It’s night-time, the bird can’t see it coming, it can’t hear the echolocation sounds. The bat has an advantage.” On close approach – perhaps alerted by the bat’s wingbeats or its shadow – the bird suddenly entered a downward spiral. The bat was observed to follow in a cat-and-mouse chase covering more than 1km, during which the microphone recorded 21 distress calls from the robin. As the pair approached ground level, a final shriek was heard from the robin, followed by 23 minutes of chewing sounds from the bat as it continued to fly at low altitude. “From a human perspective, I didn’t feel good about it,” said Stidsholt. “But, on the other hand, the bat is a very rare species and it isn’t doing very well in southern Europe due to droughts and wild fires so we want this species to have a good meal.” Previously, Ibáñez had collected, and stored in a freezer, severed songbird wings found under bats’ hunting grounds. X-ray imaging and DNA analysis of 11 wings suggested that the bats bite off and discard the wings – probably to reduce weight and drag. The researchers believe that the bats then stretch the membrane between their hind legs forward like a pouch, allowing them to eat the rest of the bird mid-flight. Elena Tena, of Doñana Biological Station and a lead author of the study, said: “While it evokes empathy for the prey, it is part of nature.” The findings are published in the journal Science .",https://www.theguardian.com/science/2025/oct/09/grisly-recording-reveals-bat-catching-killing-and-eating-robin-mid-flight,Science,BBC,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5c8d739be2a5d170aa9302dad21a243816ad81c1/0_1275_3456_2765/master/3456.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=0d2ee020c01d8432ec9f9a43e47654b8",2025-10-09T18:00:30+00:00,49a8e52c169f906e491746a09adfd90014a0cc6b
819f8edce4d2,Drummond Rennie obituary,,"In deciding what research to publish and how to appraise it, medical journals bear a heavy responsibility – as seen when it goes awry. In 1998, for instance, the Lancet published a paper falsely linking autism with the MMR (measles, mumps and rubella) vaccine. They retracted the paper , but the genie was out of the bottle: the ensuing health scare reverberates to this day. The British-born doctor and editor Drummond Rennie, who has died aged 89, was a towering figure in American medical journals, on a mission to combat inaccuracy in science reporting and drive up standards. A cartoon in the British Medical Journal in 2001 depicted him as a biblical prophet, beckoning his fellow medical editors towards “the promised land” of rigorous science reporting. He was the deputy editor of two of the world’s most influential medical journals: the New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM), from 1977 to 1981; and the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA), from 1983 to 2013. When Rennie started at the NEJM, the journal had just published an article about patients with schizophrenia having low levels of the enzyme monoamine oxidase. He was disturbed to see the same research in another journal concluding differently, saying the enzyme levels were normal. The more Rennie studied, the more he found: medical literature seemed to be riddled with anomalies, errors and shortcomings. In 1986 he summed up: “There are scarcely any bars to eventual publication. There seems to be no study too fragmented, no hypothesis too trivial, no literature citation too biased or too egotistical, no design too warped, no methodology too bungled, no presentation of results too inaccurate, too obscure, and too contradictory, no analysis too self-serving, no argument too circular, no conclusions too trifling or too unjustified, and no grammar and syntax too offensive for a paper to end up in print.” A special place in hell in Rennie’s view was reserved for people who wilfully manipulated the scientific record Peer review is at the heart of the journal publishing process. When deciding whether to publish a research paper, the journal editor sends it to experts to assess. Rennie was concerned about bias creeping in. Did reviewers, for example, look more favourably on papers written by academics known to them? He also worried that peer review simply was not doing its job: it was supposed to winnow out mistakes, but he was finding myriad problems in printed articles. Wanting to apply scientific scrutiny to the whole medical journal publishing process, in 1989 Rennie inaugurated the International Congress on Peer Review and Scientific Publication. Held every four years, it is a forum for journal editors and researchers to drive up standards and “enhance the quality and credibility of science”. Rennie was its director and then director emeritus to the end of his life. As codes of practice emerged for how to evaluate research, JAMA published guidelines for reporting randomised controlled trials in 1994, with a structured checklist to standardise how information was presented. This led to a set of rules called the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (Consort), which medical journals could sign up to. Rennie also lobbied to have all trials registered at their start and records kept of their outcomes. This was to combat the practice of trials that were unsuccessful vanishing without trace, so clinicians had no idea of drugs or treatments that did not work. In 2000 the US government brought in the clinicaltrials.gov registry, requiring researchers to register their trial. A special place in hell in Rennie’s view was reserved for people who wilfully manipulated the scientific record. In 1994, a whistleblower, “Mr Butts”, at the Brown and Williamson Tobacco Corporation sent 4,000 pages of company reports, letters and memos to a doctor at the University of California. The papers made their way to JAMA, and in an editorial Rennie scathingly called out the company, laying out how they had schemed to suppress the scientific record by hiding research that nicotine was addictive. He served on the US government’s Commission of Research Integrity and helped tighten up its rules on scientific misconduct in 1995. As well as driving up standards, Rennie wanted to improve how clinicians on the frontline make use of research. He set up the evidence-based medicine working group at JAMA, which published a series of 32 articles in the journal between 1993 and 2000. Called Users’ Guides to the Medical Literature – and later bound into a book with the same name – they brought evidence-based medicine into the mainstream, teaching doctors to critically appraise medical literature and integrate the best evidence into their practice. Rennie was born near Leeds, one of the three children of John, a British cardiologist, and Isabella (nee Wiese), a Danish-American physician. He was educated at Winchester college, before studying medicine at Cambridge University. After training at Guy’s and the Royal Brompton hospitals in London, he specialised in nephrology (kidney medicine). Taking advantage of his dual nationality, in 1967 he moved to the US to work for the nephrologist Robert “Googoo” Kark at the Presbyterian-St Luke’s hospital in Chicago. In London, Rennie had met Silvia Nussio, whom he married in 1958. Visiting her family in Switzerland, he was at first daunted by the altitudes in the Alps. That rapidly changed, and he developed a lifelong passion for mountaineering, which he was able to combine with work, joining expeditions all over the world to provide medical care and also to study the effect of high altitudes on the body. In 1970, he led an American medical relief effort in a mountainous area of Peru following an earthquake. Publishing papers on altitude medicine and nephrology in the Lancet and JAMA acquainted Rennie with the world of medical journals and he was curious to know more. In 1977 he left nephrology to become the deputy editor at NEJM. He was content to stay as deputy editor both there and at JAMA, as the “top job” came with pressures he did not care for, such as keeping management and advertisers on side. He did, however, combine his editorial work with teaching in universities: while at NEJM he was professor of medicine at Rush Medical College in Chicago, and when he moved to California to work for JAMA, he became adjunct professor of medicine at the University of California. In 1984 his marriage ended in divorce. In 1992 he married Deborah Peltzman, a data scientist. The couple loved being outdoors and, after he retired, they moved with their St Bernard dog to a “house in the woods” in Oregon, where he could hike, read and appreciate nature. Rennie is survived by Deborah, and by two children, Caroline and Nicholas, from his first marriage, and two granddaughters. His sisters, Jane and Isabel, both predeceased him.",https://www.theguardian.com/science/2025/oct/10/drummond-rennie-obituary,Science,BBC,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/43994cc494d618e2f364d51d6e9b5800153e2962/66_0_396_317/master/396.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=0bb3c5df1fab639fa5732f045f5addb1",2025-10-10T16:56:57+00:00,15046a3232489f91466db45effa90bfc39b77360
cf87dd293770,3/I Atlas: a rare comet from beyond our solar system is being closely tracked – what can it teach us?,,"You wait ages for an interstellar comet to arrive and then three come along at once. Or at least over the space of a decade. The latest interloper from another star system is the 3I/Atlas comet, which was first detected in July . As space agencies track the speeding object, here’s what we know so far. What are comets? Comets are made from material left over when star systems form. In the solar system, that means dust and ice that dates back 4.6bn years. At the heart of a comet is a central, solid nucleus, or “dirty snowball”, made of frozen water, dust and volatile substances such as carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, methane and ammonia. When a comet nears the sun, the heat sublimates the surface ice into gas, producing a temporary atmosphere or coma around the nucleus. The dust and gas released make the comet look fuzzy and produce the tails that can stretch for millions of kilometres. Comets have two tails. One is white and formed by the dust billowing off the comet, the other is bluish and made from electrically charged molecules, or ions. The ion tail points directly away from the sun, regardless of the comet’s position. Comet Neowise over Mount Washington in the US in 2020. The lower tail, which appears broad and fuzzy, is the dust tail billowing off the comet’s nucleus and trails behind the comet in its orbit. Photograph: Chris Pietsch/AP What about interstellar comets? As the name suggests, these come from even further out, having formed from the leftovers of other star systems. A chance encounter with the gravitational field of a passing star, or another massive body, can knock these comets off course and send them in our direction. So far, astronomers have only seen three interstellar comets barrelling through the solar system. The first, 1I/ʻOumuamua, was detected in 2017. The second, 2I/Borisov, was spotted in 2019, and the latest, 3I/Atlas, was reported in July this year. What can they tell us? Interstellar comets are the only material from other star systems that astronomers can observe relatively close up. If the comets pass close to the sun, the dust and gases that erupt from them reveal the chemical ingredients of the originating star system. “These objects are the first building blocks we can observe from those systems,” said Michael Küppers, project scientist on the European Space Agency missions, Comet Interceptor and Hera. “They tell us about the conditions in the stellar system where they formed.” Studies of 3I/Atlas might be more revealing than observations of previous interstellar comets. Astronomers failed to detect much gas or dust around ‘Oumuamua and 3I/Atlas will get much closer to the sun than Borisov, making it spew more gas and dust to analyse. Is 3I/Atlas special? Astronomers have seen too few interstellar comets to know what counts as normal; their rarity makes them all exciting. But a few features are particularly interesting. Early measurements suggest 3I/Atlas is between 440 metres and 5.6km across, making it potentially larger than the cigar-shaped ‘Oumuamua, which is up to 400 metres long, and Borisov, which is about 1km across. A comet streaking across a star field above the International Gemini Observatory on Cerro Pachón, near La Serena, Chile Photograph: AP An interesting feature spotted in an image from the Hubble space telescope shows that 3I/Atlas has a coma that balloons out towards the sun. This “anti-tail” is thought to be caused by uneven sublimation of ices on the comet. The comet also differs from more familiar solar system comets by the amounts of certain elements spewing off the surface. Astronomers using the European Southern Observatory’s Very Large Telescope in Chile spied a high nickel-to-iron ratio in the comet’s plume, which might be explained by sublimation of nickel tetracarbonyl and iron pentacarbonyl compounds in the comet. Other tentative observations have shown that light scattering off the comet is unusually polarised, but this could be explained by water ice and magnesium-rich silicates . Where do they come from? The comets that swing around Earth often come from the Kuiper Belt, a band of frigid bodies that lurk beyond Neptune. These take less than 200 years to complete each looping orbit around the sun. Others come from a region called the Oort cloud, which starts farther out and extends up to halfway towards our nearest neighbouring star. Comets from the Oort cloud can take 30m years to complete one orbit around the sun. There are thought to be billions of comets in the Kuiper Belt and many more in the Oort cloud. This image captured on 2 June 2025 by David Rankin, an engineer at the Catalina Sky Survey at the University of Arizona, shows 3I/Atlas. Photograph: David Rankin/David Rankin, Saguaro Observatory/AFP/Getty Images What route is the comet taking? The comet entered the solar system close to the ecliptic, the imaginary plane that contains the Earth’s orbit around the sun. Other planets orbit close to the same plane. The comet is not going to hit Earth or any other planet in the solar system. The closest it will come to Earth is 240m km, more than 1.5 times the distance between the Earth and the sun. The US astronomer Avi Loeb, who speculated that ‘Oumuamua was alien technology , has also speculated that Comet 3I/Atlas might be alien technology . He thinks the comet’s trajectory, which passes close to Jupiter, Mars and Venus, looks planned. Plus, he says the comet came from within nine degrees of the Wow! Signal, the radio waves detected in 1977 that some consider a potential alien transmission. But Loeb concedes that “by far the most likely outcome will be that 3I/Atlas is a completely natural interstellar object”. Küppers agrees. “It looks like a comet and it behaves like a comet. There’s no reason to think it’s something else,” he said. “If you start with the trajectory and then look at all kinds of distances, angles and so on, you will always find something that is relatively unlikely.” What happens next? Astronomers hope to take more images of the 3I/Atlas comet from ground- and space-based telescopes, Mars orbiters and rovers, and other probes such as the European Space Agency’s Juice mission. This week, Esa released images taken from two Mars missions, the Trace Gas Orbiter and Mars Express, as the comet zipped past the red planet. The comet was 30m km away, so appears as a small dot, but the coma is visible, showing that the sun’s heat and radiation are bringing the comet to life. When the comet is closest to Earth it will be behind the sun, but it will re-emerge in late November, giving astronomers another chance to observe it.",https://www.theguardian.com/science/2025/oct/08/a-rare-comet-from-beyond-our-solar-system-is-being-closely-tracked-what-can-it-teach-us,Science,BBC,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d0a8d36e57c93d7debe679fec693f1a625721276/81_0_350_280/master/350.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=6540ee7fb8cbf61225f8cca38ae7bc52",2025-10-08T10:11:18+00:00,634195848df8617dea179b9597a7c84c194da89b
8092ec2640d5,Scientists develop first ‘accurate blood test’ to detect chronic fatigue syndrome,,"Scientists say they have developed the world’s first blood test to diagnose myalgic encephalomyelitis, also known as chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS). There is currently no test for the condition and patients tend to be diagnosed based on symptoms, which means many can go undiagnosed for years. However, some experts not involved with the research urged caution and said the test would need to be fully validated in better designed and independent studies before it could be considered for use in clinical practice. The lead researcher, Prof Dmitry Pshezhetskiy, from the University of East Anglia (UEA) Norwich Medical School, said: “ME/CFS is a serious and often disabling illness characterised by extreme fatigue that is not relieved by rest. We know that some patients report being ignored or even told that their illness is ‘all in their head’. With no definitive tests, many patients have gone undiagnosed or misdiagnosed for years. “We wanted to see if we could develop a blood test to diagnose the condition – and we did. Our discovery offers the potential for a simple, accurate blood test to help confirm a diagnosis, which could lead to earlier support and more effective management.” Scientists at UEA and Oxford Biodynamics (OBD) looked at how DNA was folded in patients diagnosed with the condition, which could provide tell-tale signs of ME/CFS. They examined blood samples from 47 patients with severe ME/CFS and 61 healthy adults. The team discovered a unique pattern that appears consistently in people with ME/CFS that is not seen in healthy people, enabling them to develop the test. Writing in the Journal of Translational Medicine, they said the test had a sensitivity – or the likelihood of a test being positive if that patient has the condition – of 92%. It had a specificity – the probability the test will rule out negative cases – of 98%. Pshezhetskiy added: “This is a significant step forward, for the first time, we have a simple blood test that can reliably identify ME/CFS – potentially transforming how we diagnose and manage this complex disease.” Alexandre Akoulitchev, the chief scientific officer at OBD, which funded and co-authored the research, said: “Chronic fatigue syndrome is not a genetic disease you’re born with, that’s why using EpiSwitch ‘epigenetic’ markers – which can change during a person’s life, unlike fixed genetic code – was key to reaching this high level of accuracy.” However, other experts called for more studies to confirm the finding, and for the test to be assessed among a wider population of patients. Dr Charles Shepherd, medical adviser for the ME Association, said: “These results, using epigenetic profiling, appear to be an important step forward in the search for a diagnostic blood test. “However, as the researchers point out, a diagnostic blood test has to be both highly sensitive and specific to that condition. In this case, we therefore need to know whether the abnormality is consistently present in the very early stages of ME/CFS as well as in people with longstanding disease who have mild or moderate ME/CFS. “We also need to know that, in addition to the abnormality not being present in healthy controls, it is also not present in a range of other chronic inflammatory and autoimmune diseases that cause ME/CFS-like symptoms and form part of the differential diagnosis of ME/CFS.” Prof Chris Ponting, chair of medical bioinformatics at the University of Edinburgh, said some of the claims made by the research team were “premature”. He said: “This test needs to be fully validated in better-designed and independent studies before it is considered for clinical application. Even if validated, the test will be expensive, likely (about) £1,000.”",https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/oct/08/scientists-say-they-have-first-blood-test-to-diagnose-chronic-fatigue-syndrome-me,Science,BBC,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/aeace8771132ed7d06c2508e59021fe37722f5fb/0_0_5156_4125/master/5156.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=793a47bc93fa1ecc35fe153d815d2d6c",2025-10-08T04:00:16+00:00,7e5e75a142c72fdc8dc59786c9038b3925d399bf
cfe4d8c34e56,"Women carry a higher genetic risk of depression, new study says",,"Women carry a higher genetic risk of depression, a new study has found. Claiming to be the largest genetic study to date on sex differences in major depression, the research published on Wednesday in Nature Communications has found 16 genetic variants linked to depression in women and eight in men. The study, led by Australia’s QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute, showed a large proportion of the variants associated with depression were shared between sexes, but there was a “higher burden of genetic risk in females which could be due to female-specific variants”. Dr Brittany Mitchell, a senior researcher at QIMR Berghofer’s genetic epidemiology lab, said “we already know that females are twice as likely to suffer from depression in their lifetime than males”. “And we also know that depression looks very different from one person to another. Until now, there hasn’t been much consistent research to explain why depression affects females and males differently, including the possible role of genetics.” The study acknowledged explanations have been put forward spanning behavioural, environmental and biological domains, including men being less likely to seek help leading to under-diagnosis, and environmental exposures such as women being more frequently exposed to sexual abuse and interpersonal violence. The study stated that together these factors highlight the need for a “multifaceted approach” to understanding the underlying mechanisms of depression but proposed that a “key component of the biological mechanisms underlying these disparities could be differences in genetics”. The researchers analysed the DNA from five international cohorts – Australia, the Netherlands, United States and two from the United Kingdom – with a final sample size of 130,471 women and 64,805 men with major depression, and 159,521 women and 132,185 men without the diagnosis. They also found stronger genetic correlations in women between depression and metabolic traits (such body mass index and metabolic syndrome) than in men with the same traits. Dr Jodi Thomas, the lead researcher, said these genetic differences “may help explain why females with depression more often experience metabolic symptoms, such as weight changes or altered energy levels”. The authors acknowledged the study included roughly twice as many women with depression as men, and performed additional analyses to ensure their findings were not due to the difference in sample sizes. They also acknowledged limitations that their analyses were restricted to Europeans only, limiting the applicability of the findings to other populations. Prof Philip Mitchell, from the School of Clinical Medicine at the University of New South Wales, said “there has been longstanding debate about the reasons for the consistent finding around the world that depression is more common in females than males, with most studies reporting that women have two to three times the risk of depression compared to men”. “The most dominant theories have been related to social and psychological factors, for example the impact of the female role in caring for families compared to the income earning role of males, or personality vulnerabilities in women,” said Mitchell, who was not involved in the study. “This very interesting novel genetic study in a very large global study provides strong evidence that these differences in rates of depression may in fact be due to genetic factors, with the statistically significant finding of more depression risk regions in the genome in females compared to males, and little overlap in these regions between males and females. “As well as strengthening the evidence that the differences in depression rates between men and women may be largely due to biological factors, it also points to the future possibility of different pharmacological treatments for depression in women and men, as the biological systems coded for by these genetic regions become better understood.”",https://www.theguardian.com/science/2025/oct/07/women-carry-a-higher-genetic-risk-of-depression-new-study-says,Science,BBC,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5741b733902a71f2f8a225d5d6de25fe94967ef8/851_0_4341_3474/master/4341.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=845e1fc9e0adae053985db0b0e7e1e4c",2025-10-07T14:00:02+00:00,e70aac413f18d05640d36a6c9c040cf206f6fe00
02c7c15c9a53,"High youth death rates are an ‘emerging crisis’, global health study warns",,"The world faces “an emerging crisis” of higher death rates among teenagers and young adults, according to a major study on the causes of death and disability worldwide. The reasons vary from drug and alcohol use, and suicide in North America, to infectious diseases and injuries in sub-Saharan Africa, the researchers said, but warned that their data should serve as “a wake-up call”. The study also found that chronic diseases such as heart disease and diabetes now accounted for two-thirds of all ill health and that mental health problems were surging. Half of the world’s disease burden was preventable, researchers calculated, driven by risks that could be reduced, such as high blood pressure, air pollution, smoking and obesity. The Global Burden of Disease study was carried out by a network of 16,500 scientists using more than 300,000 data sources. It is published in the Lancet and was presented at the World Health Summit in Berlin on Sunday. It found that, as of 2023, death rates had fallen overall in all 204 countries and territories, and global life expectancy had recovered from a dip caused by the Covid-19 pandemic. It stands at 76.3 years for women and 71.5 for men, more than 20 years higher than in 1950 – although “stark geographic differences” remain, ranging from 83 years in high-income regions to 62 in sub-Saharan Africa. However, the authors said they were particularly concerned about stubbornly higher or rising death rates among teenagers and young adults. In North America and parts of Latin America, the rises were driven by suicide and consumption of drugs and alcohol. “Very marked increases” among teenagers and young adults “certainly got our attention when we were looking at the data”, said Dr Christopher Murray, director of the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) at the University of Washington’s school of medicine. Rising deaths in younger adults, particularly in North America, he said, were “very tied up with the rise of anxiety and depression in young people, particularly women”. While the rise of mental health disorders had received much attention, he said, there was still a lot of debate around the causes. “Is this social media? Is this [electronic] devices? Is this broader social trends on parenting? We know it was made worse by Covid. So there’s a lot of controversy, I’d say, in the psychiatric epidemiology and general social commentary about the causes around mental health. And so that’s a problem for coming up with solutions.” In sub-Saharan Africa, modelling advances revealed that deaths in children aged five to 14 since 1950 had been higher than previously thought, with drivers including infectious diseases and unintentional injuries. For girls and women aged 15 to 29, the death rate was 61% higher than previously estimated, mostly due to deaths in pregnancy or childbirth , road injuries and meningitis. Murray said: “The evidence presented in the Global Burden of Disease study is a wake-up call, urging government and healthcare leaders to respond swiftly and strategically to the disturbing trends that are reshaping public health needs.” Dr Githinji Gitahi, chief executive of Amref Health Africa, said that the 60% of people in Africa aged under 25 represented “an incredible potential”. “Health is the most powerful investment in this, and integrated care is the key, when we face the triple burden of cost of living, rising non-communicable diseases and communicable disease outbreaks, and climate change,” he said. “Siloed approaches to healthcare are failing our young people. Diseases like malaria, HIV and tuberculosis still claim too many young lives due to weak health systems, disrupted care and vaccine gaps. “At the same time, the exponential rise in non-communicable diseases among younger Africans is not just a future threat; they claim young lives daily, now. There is too little regulation of food production and scant nutrition education in urban environments that are changing lifestyles and outlooks.” He called for “stronger health systems founded on real youth-centred public health investment”. Emmanuela Gakidou, senior author and professor at IHME, warned that existing progress in low-income regions was at risk due to recent international aid cuts. She said: “These countries rely on global health funding for life-saving primary care, medicine and vaccines. Without it, the gap is sure to widen.” The Global Burden of Disease study is partly funded by the Gates Foundation, which is a philanthropic organisation that also contributes funding to support the editorially independent global development section of the Guardian",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2025/oct/12/global-burden-disease-study-high-youth-death-rates-drugs-alcohol-suicide-emerging-crisis,Science,BBC,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/17c405f0f825754ee914ebdb7cddf255c094e680/428_0_4209_3367/master/4209.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=30f3ffdae8d3d56f300da0dfd1bba53e",2025-10-12T14:00:54+00:00,ff73770b3e0a4686e5e9b8d741b188b0b90205e6

0dad681f991a,Scientist learns he has won Nobel prize while on digital detox in US mountains,,"Out on a digital detox in the western US backcountry, scientist Fred Ramsdell was startled when his wife let out a yell. He feared she had spotted a grizzly bear, only to discover a far better surprise – he had won the Nobel prize in medicine. The Nobel committee had been unable to reach the immunologist, whose phone was on airplane mode as he was on a hiking and camping trip, but finally got through to the couple early on Tuesday morning, Swedish time. “They were still in the wild and there are plenty of grizzly bears there, so he was quite worried when she let out a yell,” said Thomas Perlmann, secretary general of the Nobel committee. “Fortunately, it was the Nobel prize. He was very happy and elated and had not expected the prize at all.” Perlmann said Ramsdell and his wife, Laura O’Neill, had been heading back to their hotel when they stopped to fix something on their car. That was the moment Ramsdell’s wife switched on her mobile phone and saw the dozens of congratulatory messages. Speaking to the New York Times from a hotel in Montana later on Tuesday, Ramsdell said he “certainly didn’t expect to win the Nobel prize”. The couple had been on a three-week trip that crossed the mountain ranges of Idaho, Wyoming and Montana. “It never crossed my mind,” he said. Ramsdell shared the 2025 prestigious prize with Mary Brunkow of the Institute for Systems Biology in Seattle and Shimon Sakaguchi of Osaka University in Japan for their discoveries related to the functioning of the immune system . They will receive a prize of 11m Swedish kronor (about £871,400). The award celebrates a fundamental discovery relating to T-cells, an important player in the immune system. T-cells are a type of white blood cell, produced in the bone marrow, that help to flag invading microbes and kill infected or cancerous cells. They are often referred to as “security guards”. At the time of the initial announcement on Monday, Perlmann revealed he had managed to reach only Sakaguchi. “We have their phone numbers, but they’re probably on silent mode,” he said. Brunkow was later contacted, but Ramsdell, 64, remained incommunicado. A spokesperson from Ramsdell’s San Francisco-based lab, Sonoma Biotherapeutics, said later on Monday that he was “living his best life” and was “off the grid”. Meanwhile, Jeffrey Bluestone, a friend of Ramsdell and co-founder of the lab, said he had “been trying to get a hold of him” but thought “he may be backpacking”. Contacting Nobel prize winners across the globe has been a continuing frustration. The musician Bob Dylan ignored his 2016 Nobel literature prize for days , while the 2011 medicine prize was announced only to find that one of the winners had died days before. In 2020, the Nobel committee had similar difficulties for the winners of the prize for economics. When Bob Wilson’s phone rang in Stanford in the middle of the night, he unplugged it, so the committee had to call his wife instead. When the committee could not reach his fellow winner Paul Milgrom either, Wilson had to go and wake him up. Footage from Milgrom’s security camera captured the moment he was told of his Nobel win, to which he responded: “Yeah, I have? Wow.” Reuters and Agence France-Presse contributed to this report",https://www.theguardian.com/science/2025/oct/07/scientist-learns-he-has-won-nobel-prize-while-on-digital-detox-in-us-mountains,Science,BBC,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5539506352fcbc7144d61288e4e44ca0fb81c341/339_0_2505_2004/master/2505.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=ffbf8fd6aaeb1499b1f15de084686866",2025-10-07T12:42:52+00:00,4444254df2421a1fa28dab18466b3a3ee65c0067
b327d116c39b,Nobel prize in physics awarded to three scientists for work on quantum mechanics,,"The Nobel prize in physics 2025 has been awarded to British, French and American scientists for pioneering experiments that paved the way for the next generation of quantum technologies. John Clarke, a British physicist based at the University of California at Berkeley, Michel Devoret, a French physicist based at Yale University, and John Martinis, of the University of California Santa Barbara, shared the 11m Swedish kronor (about £871,400) prize announced by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences in Stockholm. The trio led a series of experiments that demonstrated that the bizarre properties of the quantum world can translate into measurable effects in macroscopic electrical circuits. This included a demonstration that so-called quantum tunnelling – the equivalent of a ball passing straight through a brick wall – can occur in superconducting electrical circuits. The scientists were honoured for the “discovery of macroscopic quantum mechanical tunnelling and energy quantisation in an electric circuit”, which paved the way for the development of quantum cryptography and quantum computers. Speaking at a press conference, Prof Clarke, who had only learned of the award through a phone call, said it had never occurred to him that the breakthrough could be awarded the Nobel prize. He said: “To put it mildly, it was the surprise of my life. I’m completely stunned.” “This is something that … led to the development of the quantum computer,” added Clarke, in whose lab at Berkeley the experiments took place in the 1980s. “It’s recognised that our discovery is, in many ways, the basis of this.” Quantum theory was developed initially in the early 20th century to explain the physics of the atomic realm, an invisible world that operates on a scale too small to be observed through a microscope. In the quantum world, a particle trapped in an energetic well can “tunnel” its way to freedom, even if it does not have enough energy to climb out. Working in Clarke’s Berkeley lab, where Devoret had joined as a postdoc and Martinis as a doctoral student, the team began investigating whether similar phenomena might occur at a macroscopic scale in superconductors. In superconductors, current flows with no resistance and this means the electrons are expected to behave in synchrony. This means that, theoretically, the electrons in a superconductor can be thought of as a single, giant particle filling the entire circuit – but it was not known whether this would translate to them possessing the quantum behaviours seen in particles at an atomic scale. The experiments focused on a component known as the Josephson junction, in which two superconductors are joined together with a thin insulating barrier between them. According to classical physics, the two sides of the junction are isolated from each other. However, the scientists found that the entire system was able to tunnel through the Josephson junction, causing a voltage to appear across the barrier. By studying how long it took for the voltage blip to occur, they also showed that this macroscopic tunnelling followed the same probability-based rules as well-known quantum phenomenon such as the decay of radioactive nuclei. “This work kickstarted the idea that we could get control over the quantum world,” said Dr Malcolm Connolly, who researches quantum behaviour of materials at Imperial College London. “Their discoveries of tunnelling and energy quantisation laid the foundation for today’s superconducting qubits, one of the leading platforms in the global race to build practical quantum computers.” Superconducting circuits are one of the techniques being explored in attempts to construct a future quantum computer and, in 2014, Martinis and his team were hired by Google to build the first useful quantum computer (he resigned from his role at Google in 2020). “It is wonderful to be able to celebrate the way that century-old quantum mechanics continually offers new surprises,” said Olle Eriksson, chair of the Nobel committee for physics. “It is also enormously useful, as quantum mechanics is the foundation of all digital technology.”",https://www.theguardian.com/books/2025/oct/07/nobel-prize-in-physics-awarded-to-scientists-quantum-mechanics,Science,BBC,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8e78bbf5022bd23d079af4a46d6fb3ef45bafc0a/688_0_6880_5504/master/6880.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=321658eee461d9f7d8c1a6ed05607f27",2025-10-07T12:34:00+00:00,f992c327f2c0e27823550e891136a4bb947ab2f2
4e12552fdbd3,Dogs name toys while elephants name each other. Animal language is more complex than we imagine,,"Another day, another cute story about how dogs can grasp elements of human language and use them to communicate with us. First, there was Mr Waffles, the Yorkshire terrier that“talks” to his owners by pressing electronic buttons that have been pre-programmed with words and phrases. In one of his videos , viewed more than half a million times, the pint-sized pooch stares defiantly at the camera and responds to an empty packet of treats by pressing the “I don’t give a damn” button. Followed by the “bitch” button. Bad dog, Mr Waffles. Then, last month, researchers reported that some dogs can mentally categorise their toys depending on their use. “Fetch toys” can be distinguished from “tug of war toys”, and retrieved appropriately. I’m a dog owner. I fully admit to being one of the third of Britons who would rather talk to their pets than to people. At first glance, the study seems to confirm what I already knew – that my dog understands everything that I say – but while interactions like this tell us something about how smart dogs are, they barely scrape the surface of their communicative abilities. In recent years, many parallels have been drawn between animal communication and human language. We have learned, for example, that some animals have names that they use for each other. Elephants use particular vocalisations – harmonically rich, low-frequency sounds – to address key members of their group. “Hey, Dave, over here!” In their early months of life, bottlenose dolphins invent their own unique “ signature whistle ”, which goes on to become the name that others use to call them. During this same time period, mother dolphins communicate with their youngsters using “ motherese ”. Just like human mums, they adjust the frequency and pitch of the sounds they make to a create a singsong tone thought to facilitate bonding. Meanwhile, songbirds have different regional dialects , meaning the sparrows near me sing with the avian equivalent of a Birmingham accent – “All right, bab!” And sperm whales, which use “names” and accents, have recently been shown to have their own phonetic alphabet . The gentle giants communicate with patterns of clicks. By altering their rhythm, tempo, duration and number, simple units of sound can be combined to generate complexity. According to the scientists who discovered the phenomenon, this is similar to the way that humans combine sounds to form words. Whenever these stories break, they are met with surprise. “Aren’t animals clever?! Who’d have thought it?!” But none of this should be surprising. All of these animals live deeply complex, rich and social lives. Sperm whales, for example, live in tight-knit female-led groups , which sometimes come together to form larger groups known as “ vocal clans ”. They hunt together, babysit for each other and work together to see off predatory orcas. Of course they have complex communication. They need it for survival. The mistake, however, is to presume – a priori – that animal communication is anything like ours. All too often we try to crowbar animal communication into a human-centric framework, but it’s like trying to fit a square peg in a round hole. We’ll never solve the puzzle, because there will always be a fundamental mismatch. Just as a cuttlefish would miss the subtlety of human sarcasm, so too humans are unlikely ever to understand the full spectrum of cuttlefish communication. When they dynamically change the patterning and colour of their skin, it’s fascinating, but alien. Different animals communicate in different ways. Sure they use sound, but they also use colour, smell, electricity , vibrations and the medium of expressive dance . There is an abundance of animal communication that we miss because we don’t have the sensory organs or humility to detect it. Human language – with names and words and syntax and grammar – is just one solution that one species has evolved to help it navigate the challenges that it faces. Non-human animals live different lives with different struggles. If we really want to grasp what animals are “saying”, we need to understand their communication on their terms, not ours. skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Matters of Opinion Guardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and more Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Through careful observation, she uncovered a wealth of previously unrecognised complexity, including the discovery that chimps communicate using body language as well as sound. Contemporary ethologists have built on this. The work of Cat Hobaiter from the University of St Andrews shows that chimps have a rich repertoire of gestures that they use for close-up communication. They don’t have “words” , but they do have flexible articulate signals that have meaning. So, when a chimp makes an audibly loud, long, slow scratch, it can mean “groom me”, but it can also mean “let’s travel”. And while they may not have specific gestures or calls for different types of food, such as figs or seeds, maybe they don’t need them. What humans and chimps consider useful information is different. So, instead of marvelling at the ability of pooches to press word buttons, take time instead to marvel at the way dogs communicate with dogs.

ac9ac23816d5,"In the age of false information, we all need a good BS detector. Here’s how to sort facts from harmful fiction",,"E rnest Hemingway famously said that every good writer needs a built-in BS detector. But in 2025 we all need one. High levels of scientific misinformation are threatening the wellbeing of families and our society, and the problem is worsening at an alarming rate. Artificial intelligence and social media are turbocharging the spread of misinformation dressed as science. Lies that once travelled slowly, and stayed relatively local, now surge across the globe. When people share mistruths – for example, about vaccines, paracetamol or clean energy – the consequences are real and sometimes tragic. Preventable diseases such as measles are now returning to Australian communities because of unfounded fears about vaccines. Misinformation is false or misleading information. Sometimes it’s spread by people who deliberately lie about the facts; this is referred to as disinformation. And sometimes it’s spread by those who just don’t know better. Either way, it is becoming more pervasive and more corrosive at all levels. At a personal level, bad information can damage your health, lead to poor financial decisions, and undermine your ability to make informed choices. At a societal level, it erodes trust in institutions, poisons public debate, and pushes people to extremes. Ultimately, misinformation makes it harder to agree on facts, harder to work together to solve shared problems, and undermines the social cohesion and democratic resilience that Australians value. The good news? There are simple steps we can take to combat misinformation – especially if we understand why we are susceptible to it. Australia’s top science advisory body to the prime minister – the National Science and Technology Council – last year commissioned landmark reports on misinformation. As a member of that council, I look forward to their release later this year. The reports explore why individuals and communities are vulnerable to misinformation, and what can be done to build resilience. The reports show we can be vulnerable to misinformation because of the way our brains are wired. Research finds humans are naturally inclined to believe new information – especially if it’s simple, familiar, or comes from people we trust. The more we see it, the more credible it seems, even if it’s false. Poor physical or mental health can also reduce cognitive capacity, increasing susceptibility to falsehoods. When faced with large volumes of information, we often rely on mental shortcuts. While they help us process the information quickly, they can backfire – especially when the information is emotional, threatening or comes from like-minded people. We’re more likely to believe it if it aligns with our existing views or comes from someone we trust. In light of our brain’s wiring, when confronted with new information we need to pause and ask: is this the best information I can get? Would it stand up to scientific scrutiny? Did it come from someone using the scientific method – a way of rigorously testing ideas through observation, hypothesis and experiment – or just from someone I follow online? You don’t need to be a scientist to spot good science. If in doubt, look for scientific consensus – the collective agreement of experts that is based on accumulated evidence. It is built through repeated testing, peer review and open debate. Peer review – where scientists scrutinise each other’s work – helps detect and correct errors. It’s not perfect, but it’s robust. For example, early in the Covid pandemic, scientists initially underestimated the impact of airborne transmission. But peer-reviewed studies quickly corrected that understanding, leading to updated health advice. That is science working as it should. Trusting science isn’t about having blind faith in scientists. It’s trust in the scientific method: predict, test, observe, refine. Science questions everything, and while it doesn’t claim perfection, it offers the best knowledge we have at any given time. It’s not the only source of truth, but it’s a damn good one. Almost every element of modern life – including the device you’re reading this on – is built on knowledge gained through the scientific method. Sorting through information in real time is hard. If we’re not confident doing that sorting alone, we’re lucky in Australia to have organisations – like the CSIRO, our universities, museums, hospitals, and health and environment departments – that can provide the best available information. We need to cherish those institutions , especially when we face significant challenges, even if the best available information evolves over time. In addition to those institutions, education and civic engagement can also play a crucial part in sandbagging our communities against a tide of falsehoods. Some BS is easy to sniff out – cancer cure scams, flat earth nonsense and evolution denial. Other misinformation is harder to detect but just as dangerous, so we must be extremely vigilant because the stakes are extremely high. Our collective wellbeing depends on our capacity to distinguish credible science from persuasive fiction. It depends on our willingness to think critically, seek reliable proof from credible sources, and keep our BS detectors switched on.",https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/oct/08/in-the-age-of-false-information-we-all-need-a-good-bs-detector-heres-how-to-sort-facts-from-harmful-fiction,Science,BBC,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7810296e0f9433779b2820699fd5c594aed354be/0_0_2500_2000/master/2500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=731aa5a8e8f06ef0392667437246af8d",2025-10-07T22:41:10+00:00,8658680a6fa6ef42b66ea1c981087198a08f3158
32257f3cb8fe,"Finland is ready for the next crisis, with stockpiled food and 72-hour kits – Europe should be too",,"I n times of crisis, food is more than sustenance. It is a pillar of national stability. Finland has long understood this, not just because of policy, but because of who we are and where we live. Geography, a mild continental climate and our history have shaped a mindset where preparedness is essential. In a country with vast territory, a sparse population and long distances between communities, resilience must be built into everything we do. This understanding is deeply rooted in our society, in individual households as much as government institutions. Today, Finland’s approach to preparedness is rightly seen as a model for Europe . But it is not a one-size-fits-all solution. What works for Finland, such as our high levels of food self-sufficiency, strong institutions and a culture of cooperation, may not work elsewhere. Still, our experience offers valuable lessons. Preparedness must be proactive, inclusive and deeply integrated into national strategy. My job at the National Emergency Supply Agency (Nesa) means I spend much of my time thinking about what could go wrong – and more importantly, how we can make Finland ready for when it does. Whether we face a pandemic, cyber-attack or geopolitical shock, our job is to ensure the country can continue to function, feed itself and protect its people. The Covid-19 pandemic and war in Ukraine have shown how fragile global systems can be. One of the cornerstones of our national resilience is the strategic grain reserve system. These reserves include wheat, oats, barley and rye, grains that are central to both our agriculture and our diet. Stored in secure facilities across the country, they are rotated using the Fifo (first in, first out) method to maintain quality and ensure older grains are used before newer ones. These reserves are designed to sustain the population for nine months in the event of a global supply-chain collapse or domestic production disruption. During the pandemic and the war in Ukraine, they have helped reassure the public. Finland’s food self-sufficiency rate is around 80%. That means we produce most of the food we consume, which is a rare achievement in today’s interconnected world. This is thanks to our farmers, who operate more than 40,000 farms nationwide. In 2024, crop production was the main activity on 74% of farms, while livestock farming was practised on 20%. The average farm size is 56 hectares. Despite a short growing season and a limited variety of crops, our agricultural sector is efficient, innovative and supported by strong infrastructure. These farms are the backbone of our food system and their role in national security cannot be overstated. A tractor harrowing farmland in Lieto, Finland. Photograph: Jarmo Piironen/Alamy We have even developed our own rapeseed cultivar, Aurea CL , specifically suited to the Nordic climate. It helps ensure that domestically produced rapeseed oil and protein-rich feed remain available even during times of crisis. This kind of innovation reflects our long-term commitment to resilience. But preparedness is not just about stockpiles and production. It is about systems that can adapt and continue to function under stress. Finland’s food supply chain is resilient by design. The government works closely with producers, processors, retailers and logistics companies to ensure continuity. Emergency plans are in place to reroute deliveries and prioritise essential goods. We also maintain emergency fuel reserves to keep agricultural machinery and food transport running during crises. A key part of our strategy is public-private partnerships. At Nesa, we collaborate with companies across the food sector, from grain mills to supermarket chains. Together, we develop contingency plans, run joint exercises and share information. This cooperation is not just policy. It is the way things are done. Businesses understand their role in national preparedness and take it seriously. Preparedness also starts at home. In Finland, household-level readiness is essential. One of our most effective tools is the 72-hour model, which encourages every household to be self-sufficient: to have enough food and bottled water (five litres per person) for three days. We advise having a stock of dry foods that keep well, such as nuts or dried fruit. Our home emergency supply kit checklist includes such items as a first aid kit, iodine tablets, a battery-powered radio, torch, power bank, portable stove, toilet paper and duct tape. skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to This is Europe The most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environment Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

28e2ad9a049f,The Guardian view on Merck’s exit: Britain’s biopharma strategy stalls in the face of China’s rise,,"W hen Merck abruptly scrapped its billion-pound London research hub last week, critics blamed Britain’s lacklustre support for life sciences and a Scrooge-like grip on NHS drug prices. But one important factor may have been missed. That Merck, which is also cutting jobs elsewhere – 6,000 globally – is recalibrating not just in response to the UK or the US, but to China. Merck’s cash cow is pembrolizumab (brand name Keytruda ), an immunotherapy drug launched in 2014 that has successfully treated advanced melanoma, head and neck, lung, cervical and other cancers. It blocks an antibody called PD-1, teaching the immune system to fight the cancer. Because some patients are out of other options, the results sometimes seem miraculous. But Keytruda’s patent runs out in 2028. And now there is another drug on the global market, called ivonescimab, made by Akeso Biopharma. In head-to-head trials, reported in the Lancet journal in March, the innovative Chinese drug, which hits an additional tumour target, outperformed Merck’s – and it’s cheaper. The World Health Organization now lists PD-1 drugs as essential medicines worldwide, with no special status for Keytruda. No wonder Merck is cutting costs. Experts warn that this is no flash in the pan. Both treatments are products of a shift in the technology from pharma to biopharma. The former delivered mass-market drugs; the latter produces bespoke, high‑cost therapies. Richard Sullivan, professor of cancer and global health at King’s College London, and Lewis Husain, a research fellow at the Institute of Development Studies, wrote earlier this year that China, once seen as a follower, is now emerging as a global leader in cutting-edge biopharmaceutical treatments, reshaping the competitive landscape. The closure of Merck’s UK research centre, with the loss of 125 scientist positions, is another setback for the government’s biopharma ambitions. AstraZeneca has already scrapped vaccine research expansion in Liverpool. In an interview with the BBC, Sir John Bell , Oxford’s former regius professor of medicine, said industry bosses had told him that they see Britain as a poor bet. They demand more subsidies, higher drug-price caps and fast NHS approval for expensive new biopharma treatments. Yet these niche therapies benefit only a small number of patients, and higher spending on them inevitably leaves less for everyone else’s healthcare. Donald Trump is setting the mood music, demanding drug firms make their medicines in the US. Merck, known as MSD in Europe but headquartered in New Jersey, will be looking to oblige. The nominally Anglo-Swedish AstraZeneca, which followed Merck by announcing it was “pausing” a £200m research expansion in Cambridge, in July pledged to spend £37bn on research and development and manufacturing in the US by 2030. But this is a global industry. AstraZeneca, Pfizer, Roche and GSK are among the big players now doing deals to develop new Chinese drugs. Countries will buy the best medicines they can afford, which may be Chinese. Britain can’t just rely on price caps and vague industrial strategy promises. It needs to examine how rivals structure their incentives, regulation and support – and then decide where it can compete. That doesn’t mean simply inflating the NHS drugs bill, but targeting strengths. With the US retreating from mRNA – the platform behind the most widespread Covid vaccines – Britain has a rare opening.",https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/sep/15/the-guardian-view-on-mercks-exit-britains-biopharma-strategy-stalls-in-the-face-of-chinas-rise,Science,BBC,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8556237f181d1ed43a6512335fc61b7f430df3e6/623_0_6830_5464/master/6830.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=c0c747f05ccd483d71c51af3f85acf5a",2025-09-15T17:45:39+00:00,c77fa9cbe38d05bb09639fe963c8eddbb28cb2f5

677a641c3de4,Friday briefing: The Huntington’s treatment is a ray of light for victims of a brutal disease,,"Good morning. Few medical diagnoses are as brutal and devastating as Huntington’s disease. For decades, those who inherited this cruel condition faced only despair. There was no cure. Symptoms began with mood swings and depression, then progressed to a loss of movement, followed by dementia, paralysis and, ultimately, death. Some patients died within a decade of diagnosis. Finally, a ray of light has burst through. For the first time, Huntington’s disease has been treated successfully through gene therapy, slowing the progress of the disease by 75% in patients after three years in a groundbreaking trial. It is one of several extraordinary medical advances announced in recent months, alongside new possible treatments and diagnostic tests for Alzheimer’s, heart disease and stroke. For today, I spoke with Hannah Devlin, the Guardian’s science correspondent, about the exciting research behind this desperately needed good news, and why cuts to scientific research could put future progress at risk. That’s after the headlines. Five big stories France | The former French president Nicolas Sarkozy has been found guilty of criminal conspiracy , and given a five-year prison sentence. UK politics | All working adults will need digital ID cards under plans to be announced by Keir Starmer , in a move that will spark a battle with civil liberties campaigners. Middle East | The White House is backing a plan that would see Tony Blair head a temporary administration of the Gaza Strip – initially without the direct involvement of the Palestinian Authority (PA), according to Israeli media reports. US news | James Comey, the former FBI director and one of Donald Trump’s most frequent targets, was indicted on one count of making a false statement to Congress and one count of obstruction of justice, in the latest move in the president’s retribution campaign against his political adversaries. UK news | The crown court backlog in England and Wales has hit a new record of almost 80,000 cases , while wait times for trial dates have reached up to four years. In depth: ‘Symptoms in the prime of your life’ Cells in the brain of a person with Huntington’s disease. Photograph: AP Huntington’s disease is a genetic disease that runs through families. It is caused by a single mutation of a gene that makes a protein called huntingtin. Huntingtin is an essential protein in the brain, but in people who have the mutation, the brain makes a toxic version of it that kills brain cells, Hannah Devlin told me. Between 6,000 and 10,000 people in the UK have the diseases, and another 20,000 are carriers of the faulty gene, which means they are likely to develop it. “If you’ve got the gene, you tend to get your first symptoms in the prime of your life – in your 30s and 40s. Then you’ll undergo a mental decline, which is a form of dementia, as well as motor issues; including jerky movements, losing your balance and gradually becoming paralysed,” Hannah said. “It’s a truly devastating condition, and one of the really awful things about it is if you’re a gene carrier, your children will have a 50% chance of also having the gene.” Over the last 10 years, Hannah has reported on notable progress in the scientific community’s understanding of how the mutant gene causes the disease. She said: “There has been growing hope that a treatment was on the horizon, but practically, there hasn’t been anything for patients. Until now.” A one-off injection The successful trial used gene therapy to silence the mutant gene so the brain stops producing the toxic protein. The challenge for researchers was overcoming the blood-brain barrier. “While drugs can flow around the body, the brain has a special barrier that stops that from happening. So getting any treatment into the brain is itself a massive hurdle,” Hannah said. The breakthrough treatment worked by delivering a small piece of genetic material attached to a harmless virus. Scientists infused the virus directly into the brain. Once inside, the virus entered neurons and delivered the genetic material that silences the mutant gene, stopping it from producing the toxic protein. The procedure is incredibly complex and delicate, Hannah said. “You have to infuse this virus into the brain very slowly, over 12 to 20 hours, through microcatheters put into the two brain areas that are most affected by Huntington’s.” She added that this gene therapy unit is remarkable because it is effectively a one-off injection. “So they had the surgery, had this treatment delivered once, and then they were followed up for three years to see whether it altered the progress of the disease.” The research shows that the gene therapy slowed the progress of the disease by 75% in patients after three years. Ripple of activity While political leaders appear intent on delivering doom and gloom, the scientific community seems determined to do the opposite. The breakthrough treatment for Huntington’s disease is the latest in a string of remarkable advances, including promising new therapies and diagnostic testing for Alzheimer’s, heart disease and stroke. “We have seen some really exciting developments in Alzheimer’s, including the approval of a couple of exciting drugs that could slow progression of the disease. They’re not currently funded by the NHS , but it’s been seen as a big development,” Hannah said. She also pointed to notable breakthroughs in how Alzheimer’s is diagnosed, including a £100 blood test and a three-minute brain scan , which medics hope could transform diagnosis of the devastating condition. These diagnostics could be critical to getting a much faster diagnosis, which is crucial to treating the disease. “Often when one breakthrough happens, it prompts this ripple of activity and things can suddenly move quite fast in an area where it feels like there was very little progress for years,” Hannah told me. The other big developments recently have been in treatments for heart disease and stroke. Researchers found that a blood-thinning drug could be more effective at preventing heart attacks and stroke than aspirin, which has been the standard for decades. “A lot of this is off the back of big investments into health research,” Hannah said, but that now appears under threat in some corners of the globe. A bright future, dimmed The breakthrough in treating Huntington’s disease would not have happened without public funding. “This is work that has been going on for more than a decade at UCL [University College London]. This is an absolutely world-leading team that has benefited from public funding into how to study this awful disease. It’s now being fast-tracked in the United States because of this incredible reputation that the FDA [Food and Drug Administration] has with speed and their links with the research community,” Hannah said. But that is now under threat. There have already been major staff layoffs at the FDA , as well as a proposed cut of more than 40% to the National Institutes of Health budget amid what has been called an “assault on science” by the Trump administration. And as I explored in my previous first edition on the impact of US cuts on vaccine research, these decisions will be felt across the world . “If you fast forward 10 years, some of the research that’s been cut will translate into fewer treatments that could help with some of these really awful diseases. In some cases, researchers are just on the cusp of being able to treat some really devastating diseases so it does feel depressing that these cuts are happening in parallel,” Hannah said. Time will tell whether other countries or global institutions step in to fill the gap left by the US. Until then, I’ll be here to deliver these happy First Editions, only tempered by a bit of caution at the end. skip past newsletter promotion Our morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it matters Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The ash stands 75ft (23 metres) tall on one of the Glasgow ’s busiest roads and has survived war, redevelopment and even ash dieback disease. Locals take pride in its elegance – it has been featured in a book and is celebrated in a nearby pub. This urban survivor will represent the UK in the European contest next spring.

The pieces cannot overlap and must fit in to the given template. Flipping pieces is allowed. For an interactive version click here. For a printable version click here Scroll below for the answer. (I didnt want to put the solution high on the page, just in case you haven’t seen it before and want to try it out first on this interactive app .) You can move the pieces with your thumb/mouse and rotate them by clicking, or pressing the buttons. The third button is for flips. The T-puzzle is simple, a primary school standard, and yet challenging to many. According to this research paper , out of five undergraduates given the puzzle the fastest took 2mins 20, the second about 9mins and the other three more than 15mins (and required a hint.) The interactive app, created by reader Phoebe Fletcher, has a timer and I was interested to see how you all got on. The stats Number who gave it a go: 24,256 Number who solved it: 9,650 (39.8 per cent) Fastest time. 6s Slowest time: 52m 46s Median time: 1m 57s Mean time: 3m 6s The 6 second response was I’m sure by someone who had seen the puzzle before, although I am extremely impressed by their nimble fingers. The 52 minute response might have been someone who fell asleep. The median, at just under two minutes, is about the same as the fastest undergraduate in the academic paper, which makes me think that the paper is more or less correct. Of those who can get it, it comes quite quickly – but for many people it really is quite tough. And now for the solution. The key insight is that the pentagonal piece must be diagonal. People who fail to solve it assume that it must be placed vertically or horizontal. I hope you enjoyed the puzzle and I’ll be back in two weeks.

3002bff08c5d,"Diane Keaton, Oscar-winning star of Annie Hall and The Godfather, dies aged 79",,"Diane Keaton, one of the best-loved film stars of the past 50 years, has died at the age of 79 in California. The news was confirmed by People magazine . Further details are not available at this time and her loved ones have asked for privacy, according to a family spokesperson. Keaton’s death came as a shock across Hollywood and the rest of the world. The actor had not been in the public eye for some months, but no illness had been announced. People quotes a source close to the actor saying that Keaton’s health had “declined very suddenly” over the past months, adding that even many of her longtime friends “weren’t fully aware of what was happening”. The Los Angeles fire department confirmed to TMZ that they had responded to an emergency call at Keaton’s home at 8:08am local time and an individual had been transported to a local hospital. Her frequent co-star Robert De Niro told the Hollywood Reporter: “I am very sad to hear of Diane’s passing. I was very fond of her and the news of her leaving us has taken me totally by surprise. I was not expecting her to leave us. She will be missed. May she rest in peace.” In a statement shared with the Guardian, Meryl Streep, who starred alongside her in Marvin’s Room, called Keaton: “Our American treasure: indelible singular girl and brilliant artist. Crushing news that she is gone, but her smile and her style and antic spirit will live on film and in our hearts forever.” Keaton and DiCaprio in Marvin’s Room. Photograph: Tribeca Productions/Allstar Leonardo DiCaprio, who acted alongside both women in the film, called Keaton “brilliant, funny, and unapologetically herself” on Instagram stories. “A legend, an icon, and a truly kind human being.” Bette Midler, Keaton’s co-star in The First Wives Club, said on Instagram : “The brilliant, beautiful, extraordinary Diane Keaton has died. I cannot tell you how unbearably sad this makes me. She was hilarious, and completely without guile, or any of the competitiveness one would have expected from such a star. What you saw was who she was…oh, la, lala!” The actor Michael Douglas, who starred alongside her in the 2014 romcom And So It Goes, called the loss “heartbreaking” and the actor “one of the greatest icons in our industry”, while Francis Ford Coppola said “everything about Diane Keaton was creativity personified”. Speaking on stage at a charity event, Reese Witherspoon recalled how Keaton, who she referred to as a “mentor”, had given her an early break on the 1991 TV movie Wildflower, concluding by urging audience members to “watch one of her movies and wear a really cool, interesting outfit, take a cool picture, and just live your dream. Be your unique, interesting self, I think Diane would be really happy.” Mary Steenburgen told Deadline that her co-star in the Book Club films was “magic. There was no one, nor will there ever be, anyone like her. I loved her and felt blessed to be her friend.” Keaton with her The First Wives Club co-stars Goldie Hawn and Bette Midler in 1996. Photograph: Frank Wiese/AP Fellow Book Club star Jane Fonda, meanwhile, posted that she found it “hard to believe … or accept … that Diane has passed. She was always a spark of life and light, constantly giggling at her own foibles, being limitlessly creative … in her acting, her wardrobe, her books, her friends, her homes, her library, her worldview. “Unique is what she was. And, though she didn’t know it or wouldn’t admit it, man she was a fine actress!” Alan Alda, Keaton’s co-star in the 1993 Woody Allen film Manhattan Murder Mystery, told the Guardian: He said “She’s leaving behind tender and unforgettable performances that will keep her in our hearts for a long time.” Keaton directed two music videos for the singer Belinda Carlisle, who wrote on X that she was “kind and eccentric and I was blessed to know her”. Also posting on X, the actor Ben Stiller called Keaton “One of the greatest film actors ever. An icon of style, humor and comedy. Brilliant. What a person.” Director Paul Feig posted that he was “so honored to call Diane Keaton a friend. She was an amazingly kind and creative person who also just happened to be a Hollywood legend. She has been taken from us far too soon.” Keaton with Candice Bergen, Jane Fonda and Mary Steenburgen in Book Club (2018). Photograph: Photo credit: Melinda Sue Gordon/Paramount Pictures/Allstar Nancy Sinatra said on X : “Diane Keaton has left us and I can’t tell you how profoundly sad that makes me. I adored her — idolised her. She was a very special person and an incredibly gifted actor, who made each of her roles unforgettable.” Viola Davis, meanwhile, who did not share a screen credit with Keaton, although they were both originally slated to star in 2019’s Otherhood, posted to Instagram: “No!! No!!! No!! God, not yet, NO!!! Man… you defined womanhood. The pathos, humor, levity, your ever-present youthfulness and vulnerability — you tattooed your SOUL into every role, making it impossible to imagine anyone else inhabiting them. You were undeniably, unapologetically YOU!!! Loved you. Man… rest well. God bless your family, and I know angels are flying you home.” With Allen in Annie Hall. Photograph: Pictorial Press Ltd/Alamy An enduring and singular icon of cinema since her Oscar-winning turn in 1977’s Annie Hall – which her director, writer, co-star and former boyfriend Woody Allen based heavily on her own life – Keaton starred in some of the key movies of the last half century. Her keen self-deprecation, gift for comedy and distinctive dress sense – rarely seen without a hat, turtleneck or man’s tie and wide trousers – made her both highly distinctive and impossible to emulate. Her first major film role was opposite Al Pacino in Francis Ford Coppola’s The Godfather – she reprised the role of Michael Corleone’s wife in the two sequels. Other Oscar nominations were earned for her performances in Reds (1981), Marvin’s Room (1996) and Something’s Gotta Give (2003). Meanwhile, dramas such as Looking for Mr Goodbar, Shoot the Moon and The Good Mother established her as an actor unafraid of playing difficult and unlikable women. Keaton in Love and Death. Photograph: ZUMA Press, Inc./Alamy Keaton and Allen first collaborated on the stage version of Play It Again, Sam, for which she was Tony nominated in 1971, before going on to work together for eight films, including Sleeper (1973), Love and Death (1975) and Manhattan (1979). In 1993, Keaton took on the role written for Mia Farrow in Manhattan Murder Mystery and remained a staunch supporter of Allen after the accusation by Farrow that he had abused their adopted daughter, Dylan. Allen has repeatedly denied the allegations, which were investigated and resulted in no criminal charges. Writing on Instagram in the wake of Keaton’s death, both of Allen’s adopted daughters with his wife, Soon-Yi Allen, posted their tributes to the actor, with Manzie saying she was “absolutely heartbroken”. Keaton went on to make a remarkable number of other popular and landmark comedies as well as those with Allen, including Baby Boom, Father of the Bride (and its sequels), The First Wives Club and Book Club. The sequel to that film, Book Club: The Next Chapter, released in 2023, looks set to be one of the last projects featuring Keaton. Speaking to the Guardian to promote it , she addressed why she chose to remain so prolific, making seven films since the start of the pandemic. “It gives me an opportunity to get to know more people in a different realm,” she said. “I love it. It’s all interesting. It’s never dull, ever, life.” She also explained her love for photographing doors and abandoned shops, which she said she found poignant “because life is haunting! You have an idea in your mind of what it is, or what it should be, or what it could be. But it’s not that at all! It’s just things going up and down!” Diane Keaton in a scene from The Godfather (1972). Photograph: Landmark Media/Alamy In 1996, Keaton adopted a daughter, Dexter (named after Cary Grant’s character in The Philadelphia Story), and, four years later, a son, Duke. “Motherhood has completely changed me,” she said. “It’s just about like the most completely humbling experience that I’ve ever had.” Despite well-publicised relationships with some of her co-stars including Pacino and Warren Beatty , she remained unmarried. Keaton cared for her own mother from her diagnosis with Alzheimer’s in 1993 until her death in 2008, and devoted much of her own autobiographies to recounting her mother’s life and publishing her diaries. “She was everything to me,” she said of her mother. “She was wonderful. She was my example for what you can do with life. She was the heart of everything that was best.” Keaton was also the chief care-giver to her brother, Randy , who died in 2021, after years of mental-health problems. As well as acting primarily for the big screen, Keaton did some TV work, including as a scheming nun in Jude Law TV series The Young Pope. She also had a sideline flipping properties in the US, as well as lending her name and creativity to ranges of homeware, clothing, glasses and wine. In 2017, she was given a lifetime achievement award by the American Film Institute, in which she thanked her collaborators and sang Seems Like Old Times, the song her character sings in Annie Hall. In 2022, she paid tribute to her parents while putting her hands into cement to be immortalised on the Hollywood walk of Fame, saying she was “still that little Dianey” who dreamed of being a movie star. “As a girl growing up in Orange County, the mere thought of Hollywood Boulevard seemed like a mysterious dream that would never come true,” she said. In December 2024, in what seems likely to be her final performance shared with the public, Keaton released her first single, a festive song called First Christmas , posting the video to Instagram. An enthusiastic adopter of social media, her last post was in April to mark National Pet Day, and featured a photograph of the actor with her beloved golden retriever, Reggie. She is survived by her two younger sisters, Dorrie and Robin, as well as by Dexter, 29, and Duke, 25.",https://www.theguardian.com/film/2025/oct/11/diane-keaton-oscar-winning-star-of-annie-hall-and-the-godfather-dies-aged-79,Health,BBC,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f3c8f22bf3ba1b1c9deb6a76c7dc4d07af912980/488_254_2594_2075/master/2594.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=2296b52378e14385134e215a717d6562",2025-10-11T19:15:39+00:00,8bbdf2ba8253086897815c49a282a47ce3dbcb66
014a4b10e1cf,Maureen Crill obituary,,"My wife, Maureen Crill, who has died aged 68 from complications of a rare autoimmune disease, was a nurse, midwife and health manager who spent most of her working life on challenging humanitarian postings in Africa , South America, Asia and the tip of North America. Practical, tough, down-to-earth and brave, she had great resilience, and her cool nerve marked her out for the demanding work she carried out, often in areas of armed conflict. In every setting her courage, simple kindness, professionalism and cultural sensitivity earned her respect and acceptance. Maureen was born in Rusape in Southern Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe), to May (nee Sime), a housewife, and Robert Lynch, a train driver. Her parents had left Edinburgh in the early 1950s and raised her to consider the UK as her true home. After finishing her secondary education in Bulawayo, she went to Edinburgh to train as a nurse, at the Royal Infirmary. Maureen Crill at work in the Tahoua region of Niger in 2005 Rather than settling in Edinburgh after qualifying, she returned to what was then war-torn Zimbabwe in 1979. There she worked as a nurse for the Save the Children Fund UK, running mobile clinics in remote, often insecure areas. Having witnessed the lack of care available to women in rural Africa, she returned to the UK in 1982 to train as a midwife at the Singleton hospital in Swansea. As soon as she qualified in 1984, Maureen moved to Burkina Faso , where she provided training to traditional midwives on behalf of Save the Children while living in an adobe hut, with no electricity or running water. I was the charity’s country director there, and she and I met soon after she arrived: we married in 1986. After three years in Burkina Faso, Maureen moved with Save the Children to Sindh province in Pakistan , where she was a health and nutrition programme manager. She then became a community nurse (1989-91) in the Northwest Territories of Canada and Peru (1991-94), before switching to a more managerial role as a health programme manager in Cuba (1995-96) for Save the Children and then in the Democratic Republic of the Congo for Concern Worldwide. Returning to the UK in 1998, she managed the logistics of the move of Save the Children’s head office from Camberwell to Vauxhall in London. But within a year she was out in the field again as a community nurse/midwife with Health Canada , serving Inuit settlements in the Northwest Territories and Kwanlin Dün communities in the Yukon, where we lived for the next 20 years. Throughout her time abroad, Marueen was a devoted reader of Guardian Weekly, which in those days was printed on airmail paper. Copies would follow her, often weeks old by the time she received them, and served as her window on the outside world. In 2015 we decided to live out our retirement in northern Spain, but not before one last bit of adventure: we flew to Mongolia, hired guides and camels, and rode across the Gobi desert. At the end of the trip, surrounded by curious camels, Maureen buried her straw hat in the sand, signalling the end of her adventurous years.

Not only is it bad for our health but it also requires ingredients to be transported around the world ( The hidden cost of ultra-processed foods on the environment: ‘The whole industry should pay’, theguardian.com, 8 October ). Meat and dairy are often singled out as foods detrimental to the environment. While it’s laudable to encourage people to reduce their intake of animal-based foods and eat more vegetables, nuts and grains, many of these have also to be transported great distances and so contribute to increased CO2 levels.

04dffd1dc3cc,"Millions of over-50s have undiagnosed sight and hearing problems, UK study suggests",,"Millions of people aged 50 or over in the UK have undiagnosed sight or hearing problems, according to research, prompting calls for that age group to have checkups more regularly. Doctors involved in the research said the findings were “deeply concerning” and warned that those affected were at risk of falls, mental ill-health and of leading socially restricted lives. One in four people aged 50 and over – 6.7 million people – cannot see clearly out of one or both eyes, according to a pilot stage of the UK national eye health and hearing study. And three in four older Britons – 20.3 million people – suffer from some form of hearing loss in one or both ears, according to the study, the first of its kind. The research uncovered “widespread hidden sensory loss”, the sight and hearing experts involved in the study said, with many of those affected unaware of their condition. Rupert Bourne, a professor of ophthalmology at Anglia Ruskin University and the study’s principal investigator, said: “These figures are deeply concerning. They show that sensory health is being overlooked, even among high-risk groups. We are missing critical opportunities to prevent avoidable sight and hearing loss.” The findings are based on the examination of more than 500 people aged 50 or over living at home or in care homes in Peterborough and Cambridgeshire. Extrapolated for the UK population as a whole, the findings suggest: 6.7 million people in the UK aged 50 or over have trouble seeing out of one or both eyes. 2.4 million are visually impaired in one eye 20.3 million have some form of hearing loss in one or both ears. 7.7 million cannot hear clearly with both ears. Bourne said: “We are fortunate enough to live in a country that has a national health service which offers universal care, free at the point of delivery. Yet despite this, and free NHS eye tests from the age of 60, one in four of the over-50s have vision impairment in either or both eyes, much of which could have been prevented.” The study uncovered significant “unmet need” for help with sight and hearing health. Many of those they examined said their hearing was better than tests showed it was, Bourne said. Dr Jameel Muzaffar, an ear, nose and throat consultant at University Hospital Birmingham NHS trust and co-author of the findings, said: “We know from the study that lots of people have problems with hearing that they’re just not aware of.” He and Bourne said the results were particularly worrying given the link between dementia and untreated sight or hearing problems. Hearing loss and vision loss both increase the risk of dementia, according to the most recent findings from the Lancet medical journal’s commission on how to prevent the disease, which reported in July last year. It identified depression, high blood pressure, air pollution and poor diet as other risk factors. Sight loss is estimated to cost the UK £58bn a year in lost productivity and through the burden it places on the NHS, the wider care system, families and carers. Michael Bowen, the director of knowledge and research at the College of Optometrists, said: “The study’s findings highlight how many people are not attending for regular eye tests, where these eye conditions would be picked up, even though the over-60s are eligible for free NHS eye tests across the UK.” The study’s authors say the NHS should make much wider use of mobile diagnostic tests in non-hospital settings, such as health clinics and care homes, to identify and treat sensory impairment.",https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/oct/10/millions-of-older-britons-likely-to-have-undiagnosed-sensory-problems-study-finds,Health,BBC,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bca53ff6977c15761bb3f14da91b0eeed525e7d6/407_0_4200_3360/master/4200.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=309e68b4d79083f908e9ca135c02b0b2",2025-10-10T11:11:03+00:00,2202ae7e70d61e6fa9a9bf966e216dc72c00ce71
fdf4cfce629a,Dismay and anger over Labour’s visa plans,,"As an immigrant working in the NHS on a health and care visa , I am dismayed, disappointed, angry and terrified by Labour’s immigration reform proposals, due to their potential impact on me, on other immigrants and on all British society ( NHS could cease to function under Labour’s new visa rules, say nurses, 6 October ). Until the immigration white paper was published, I naively assumed that anti-immigrant sentiment was restricted to the Tories and Reform UK. When Labour came to power, I felt tremendous relief and a budding sense of safety and optimism. I soon learned how naive I was. Betrayed and used, I now fear that I will lose my job and my home. The Labour party must come to its senses. First, immigrants already here must be allowed to apply for indefinite leave to remain (ILR) under the law as it was when we came into the country. This is only fair to our employers and us. Second, the health and care visa must remain. Think of your loved ones in need of care. Third, the time needed to get ILR and citizenship must not be increased. It is far better to have an island of strangers than one of corpses. Finally, visa fees must not be increased. We earn very little, and many struggle to pay visa renewal fees. If the NHS and councils lose much of their immigrant workforce and are made to pay higher visa-sponsorship fees for twice as long, they will be seriously affected.

c95078ae3561,Alarm as CDC calls for separate MMR vaccines despite measles outbreak,,"The measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine is undergoing more scrutiny by the Trump administration in their ongoing reassessment of vaccines despite the worst measles outbreak in decades. Jim O’Neill, the deputy secretary of the US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and the acting director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), called on Monday for new vaccines to replace the current MMR shots. “I call on vaccine manufacturers to develop safe monovalent vaccines to replace the combined MMR and ‘break up the MMR shot into three totally separate shots,’” O’Neil wrote in a post on X/Twitter. He quoted a post from Donald Trump on 26 September urging against the use of Tylenol and “mixed” vaccines, as well as delaying hepatitis B vaccination from birth until 12 years of age. Many of the vaccines in the routine childhood immunization schedule are combined in order to reduce the number of shots children receive, and their safety and efficacy have been demonstrated by decades of research. Breaking up the vaccines “would be a remarkably complicated, time-consuming, costly, but more importantly unnecessary action”, said Jason Schwartz, an associate professor at the Yale School of Public Health. Adding more shots to the schedule would make it more expensive to vaccinate children, and they would need more visits with pediatricians to receive the shots. If all childhood immunizations were given separately, it would take 20 visits to get a six-month-old fully vaccinated. “The more visits, the more appointments, the more follow-up doses that are required, parents – given that lives are complicated and vaccine schedules are complicated – will be less likely to complete all the additional appointments or follow-up visits required,” Schwartz said. “Splitting up will mean that fewer kids will complete the MMR series.” Breaking them up “serves no purpose”, said Paul Offit, director of the Vaccine Education Center at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia and the co-inventor of a rotavirus vaccine. “We’re already talking about difficulties in affording all of this.” Some vaccines, like the diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis (DTaP) shot, are only made together and cannot be broken up. While separate vaccines for measles, mumps and rubella were licensed in the 1960s, only the combined MMR shots are now available for use in the United States. The current MMR shots in the US are made by Merck and GSK. Both companies have said there is no published scientific evidence to support separating the vaccines, and the combination vaccines play an important role in making vaccination easy and inexpensive. Releasing separate vaccines now would require entirely new saline placebo-controlled clinical trials under new Trump administration policies – an “unimaginable” process when safe and effective vaccines already exist, Schwartz said. Even if manufacturers were able to create new trials for separate vaccines, it would be “incredibly unethical” to conduct them, said Angela Rasmussen, a virologist at the Vaccine and Infectious Disease Organization at the University of Saskatchewan. “You would be exposing, basically, infants to potentially lethal diseases,” she said. No ethics and regulatory board would approve such a trial, and providers and families are unlikely to participate, she added. “Those trials won’t happen.” There was another meeting of the CDC’s advisory committee on immunization practices (ACIP) planned for 22-23 October. It has been indefinitely postponed. “It’s anyone’s guess,” Schwartz said. The ACIP could say they would like to see monovalent vaccines, but there are no monovalent vaccines approved for them to recommend, he said. At the meeting in September, the independent advisers began a discussion of delaying the hepatitis B vaccine, the first of which is currently recommended at birth, but they tabled the discussion. Young children usually receive later hepatitis B doses as part of combination shots – so if that recommendation is changed, the combination vaccines would be affected. Offit has “no idea” what the vaccine advisers might discuss, he said. “These people are not making decisions based on scientific data, they’re making decisions based on their own sort of anti-vaccine notions – so who knows. Anything can happen.” But, he said, discussions about breaking up MMR specifically were asked and answered by the ACIP more than two decades ago. Offit served on the ACIP from 1998 to 2003, during which time the now-retracted study led by Andrew Wakefield was published and gained attention. Wakefield claimed without evidence in the study that there was a potential link to autism with “the combined measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine (rather than monovalent measles vaccine)”. A year before the study was published, Wakefield had filed a patent application for a monovalent measles vaccine, though he did not disclose this conflict of interest in the study. Wakefield argued that the combination shot weakened the immune system and created cascading effects that led to autism. “We had no evidence for any of this,” Offit said. The ACIP held a vote on changing the MMR vaccine recommendation soon after the study was published. “We obviously all voted no, because there was no evidence that MMR caused autism,” Offit said. There were already epidemiological studies at that time showing no relationship between being autistic and getting vaccinated. In September, the ACIP voted to remove the recommendation for the combination MMR and varicella (chickenpox) vaccine, a move that was officially adopted by the CDC last week. The changes are already creating confusion among patients and pediatric offices. “Let’s not underestimate just how damaging complexity and confusion are for vaccination efforts, for both patients and families and healthcare providers,” Schwartz said. Making the process more confusing, expensive and time-consuming is another way to keep kids from being vaccinated, Rasmussen said. “By making many of these vaccines monovalent, that’s going to actually just remove access to them, and there won’t be any vaccines at all,” she continued. “Those vaccines will probably still get made, but if a vaccine is sitting on a shelf and not going into somebody’s arm, then it’s worthless, essentially. I think anti-vaxxers love vaccines that sit on shelves.” Quick Guide Contact us about this story Show The best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.

51f580a7f1f7,"Here’s the direct effect of our NHS blame culture: babies die. Tragedy after tragedy, it can’t go on",,"L ucian Leape, a pioneer in patient safety, once said the single greatest impediment to error prevention in the medical industry is that “we punish people for making mistakes .” He was right. In my experience as health secretary, the biggest barrier to safer care in the NHS wasn’t a lack of expertise or dedication. It wasn’t – by the end – a lack of money or even clinicians. It was a blame culture that stopped people being open about mistakes. That prevents professionals from learning from tragedies and condemns the system to repeating them. At the start of Baby Loss Awareness Week, we should remember that the number of tragedies remains heartbreaking. Including stillbirths, there are 4870 baby deaths every year in the UK – around 13 every day. Some of these would have happened with the best of care, but many more could have been avoided. And every single one leaves behind devastated parents who must do what no human being should ever have to do – bury their own child. Eleven babies died needlessly in the Morecambe Bay scandal . Since I stood up in parliament to respond to the Kirkup investigation in 2015, the NHS has worked hard to learn the hard lessons involved – and progress has been made. Between 2013 and 2023, perinatal mortality in England and Wales fell by around 20% – the equivalent of more than two fewer a day. But since the pandemic, the picture is more mixed. Maternal deaths, although thankfully still rare, have risen and remain much more likely for Black and Asian mothers. Having completed her inquiry into Shrewsbury and Telford, Donna Ockenden is now looking into deaths at the Nottingham university hospitals NHS trust. Across England, two-thirds of maternity units are still rated by the CQC as “requires improvement” or “inadequate”. Many families are particularly worried about possible poor care in Leeds, so a new rapid national investigation , under the leadership of Valerie Amos, is looking into maternity safety across the NHS, including a deep dive into services at 10 trusts. If England and Wales matched the baby death rate in Japan, almost two fewer babies would die every day. Closer to home, if we matched Sweden , one fewer would die every day. Both have made great progress in tackling a blame culture that stops vital learning from happening. In Sweden there is no-fault compensation following medical error. Clinicians are wholly accountable, but because the system is not looking for a perpetrator, space is created for honest learning. It is not perfect, but it does avoid adversarial confrontation. Court cases that drag on for five years or more are almost unheard of. Joshua Titcombe with his sister Emily. Photograph: PA The UK is rather different. According to the 2024 NHS staff survey, more than a third of staff don’t feel comfortable speaking up about safety concerns. Even if they want to be open and transparent, the system makes it difficult. Many worry they will be scapegoated by their organisation. Lawyers get involved. Families feel shut out. And the result is that the most important thing of all does not happen: understanding any failures so that system-wide improvements can be put in place to stop the same thing happening again. It doesn’t have to be this way. One of the babies who died at Morecambe Bay was Joshua Titcombe. Years later, his father, James , met one of the midwives involved. She had missed crucial opportunities to escalate concerns and had been suspended from practice. James knew there was no malice – she had been doing what seemed right to her at the time. But he still felt angry: her later statements conflicted with his family’s experience. But in that meeting, something extraordinary happened. The midwife spoke of how she still thought about Joshua, that she wished she had acted differently, and that she was deeply sorry. They ended up crying together. Supported afterwards, she returned to practice. James is certain she will not make the same mistakes again. Honesty and forgiveness don’t just heal – they lead to safer care. If we want to break the cycles of fear and blame that are so common at the moment, we need to reform a system that often means a bereaved family’s only friend is their lawyer. The primary focus of the law is – rightly – justice, but we should not rely on it to improve patient safety. We now spend much more settling litigation claims for baby harm and death every year than the entire cost of NHS maternity services . skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Matters of Opinion Guardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and more Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

That would be far more consistent with NHS values – and by allowing learning to happen, save countless lives in the process. When Japan did something similar to Sweden for children born with severe cerebral palsy, the number of cases dropped by a quarter in just four years . This is not an argument to exonerate clinicians who deliberately harm patients or fail to learn from mistakes they make. Healthcare professionals don’t go to work to cause harm, but good intentions alone are not enough: competence, behaviour and integrity matter as they do in all professions. But a constructive, just culture should distinguish between professional negligence and the ordinary human mistakes any of us can make. Accountability is not the same as blame.

77ce583e17f9,Look out for number one! Selfish self-help books are booming – but will they improve your life?,,"‘A re you sure you want that one?” asks the assistant in the flagship Waterstones store in Piccadilly, London. I’d picked up a classic self-help book, Thinking, Fast and Slow, by Daniel Kahneman, amid a tranche of the much more fashionable titles such as The Let Them Theory; Fawning; The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck; The Courage to Be Disliked. “Is that not the one everyone’s reading?” I ask. She hands me the cloth-bound Don’t Believe Everything You Think. “ This is the one everyone’s reading.” Self-help book sales in the UK grew every year between 2015 and 2023, according to Nielsen . And that’s just the overt titles, not counting “stealth-help” (memoir, nature writing, bibliotherapy – poems and what’s considered likely to cheer you up). But the books shifting the most units in recent years are a very specific tranche of self-help: the idea that you help yourself by only looking out for number one. Some are about stopping trying to please other people; others say stop thinking about them altogether. What could I learn from reading them? Fawning: Why the Need to Please Makes Us Lose Ourselves and How to Find Our Way Back, by the US psychologist Dr Ingrid Clayton, is the latest book in the selfish self-help subgenre. You’ve probably heard of “fight, flight or freeze” – the body’s primal responses to threat. Flight is a great response if, for example, you meet a tiger. It’s not so helpful in a work meeting. “Fawning” is a new addition to the trauma response lexicon and, Clayton writes, is distinct from the well-worn terms “people-pleasing” and “co-dependency” (though she says they are “branches on the overall fawning tree”). Often, fawning behaviour is politically reinforced by the patriarchy and “white body supremacy” (an attitude that elevates whiteness as the standard by which to judge everyone). So fawning is not your fault, but it is your problem, because it entails stifling your thoughts and feelings, sidelining your needs and imperatives, to mollify another person in the moment. Clayton’s book is good: expert, vulnerable, disarming, thoughtful. Nevertheless, it lands squarely on the self-help question of our time: “What would you do if you were putting yourself first in your own life?” Just a few of the self-help books that are jumping off the shelves. Photograph: David Levene/The Guardian Mel Robbins has sold 6m copies of her book The Let Them Theory, and has 11m followers on Instagram. Her philosophy is that not only should you put yourself first (which she calls “let me”), you have to also let others put themselves first (“let them”). For example: “Let my family be late to absolutely everything we go to,” she writes. “Let the neighbour’s dog bark all day.” There’s an intellectual honesty to this, in so far as it asks readers to consider not just what would happen if they lived more selfishly, but if everybody did. But at the same time, Robbins’s tone is “wise up” – everyone else is already letting their dog bark all day. If you can’t embrace the “let them, let me” credo, you’ll be stuck in a world where you’re worrying about the negative opinions of others, and – newsflash – they’re not worrying about yours. This will consume your time, energy and emotional headroom, to the extent that, ultimately, you won’t be in charge of your own trajectory. That’s what she says to packed theatres on her global tours – London this year; New Zealand, Australia and the US (again) next. She has been a lawyer, a broadcaster, a podcaster; she’s been riding high and shot down like a broad from a Frank Sinatra song. But, essentially, she’s someone to whom people listen – whether her words are in a book, on Instagram or spoken live. I do not want to sound like a second-wave feminist, but the male authors in this terrain are basically the same, but stupider. Mark Manson’s The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck: A Counterintuitive Approach to Living a Good Life frames the problem slightly differently: seeking the approval of others is just one of a number of fallacies – along with seeking happiness, “victimhood chic”, the “responsibility/fault fallacy” – getting in between you and your goal, which is to not give a fuck. Manson started blogging dating advice in 2008, before graduating to everything advice. The Let Them theory is not only should you put yourself first, you have to also let others put themselves first Ichiro Kishimi and Fumitake Koga’s The Courage to Be Disliked – which has sold 10m copies, and “can change your life” (according to it) – is written as a dialogue between a prominent Japanese philosopher and psychologist (Kishimi) and a youth (Koga is 52; hell, let’s call him a youth). It is based on the precept that Freud was wrong, and his contemporary Alfred Adler (we’ll come back to Adler) was right – the past doesn’t matter; only your goals matter. Freud was an aetiologist (looking for causes); Adler was a teleologist (explaining behaviour in terms of the purpose it serves, rather than its root). From here, all problems become interpersonal problems (which is absolutely true unless your problem, for example, is that your local food bank just flooded and you have nothing to feed your baby; but I guess the baby is still a person, so fine). And therefore it follows that being disliked by other people “is proof that you are exercising your freedom and living in freedom”. Joseph Nguyen’s 2022 book Don’t Believe Everything You Think: Why Your Thinking Is the Beginning and End of Suffering is a global bestseller. He makes a similar case, based on wisdom from Zen monks – who themselves are a patchwork of parables, rather than actual monks – that all negative emotions are generated not by circumstances or past events, but by the way we think about them. His prescription is even simpler: stop thinking. I’m not joking. By chapter 7, we’re into “Practical steps for how to stop thinking” (they are – pause, take a beat; ask yourself whether your thinking is taking you in a good direction; understand that you have a choice to stop thinking; say a mantra, maybe “thinking is the root cause of suffering”, or “stop thinking, idiot”; finally, experience the feeling, without putting any thoughts on it. Yes, these steps – pause, ask, understand, say and experience – spell PAUSE; well spotted). These radical self-reliance books are on a spectrum, from the smart and well-researched to the less smart. All are threaded together by their confidence, but what self-help book has ever not had that? One thing is certain – it’s falling on parched earth, hitting a help-thirsty world in its most receptive spot. People are waiting for permission to live their best, Ayn Randian life, one in which your only moral purpose is your own happiness, and anyone who can convincingly give that permission – well, I wouldn’t want to speculate on their fulfilment, but they’re definitely minted (opinion is divided on wealth and its place in the firmament of meaning). Laurie Santos, a psychology professor at Yale University, speaking to me by email, betrays some impatience with the idea that self-reliance will bring wellbeing. “Study after study shows the opposite. We often think we’ll be happiest when we focus on ourselves, but one of the most reliable ways to boost our own happiness is by focusing on others. I always tell my students that self-care is a misnomer. Becoming other-oriented boosts our mood and gives us a sense of purpose.” Santos points to research from Harvard Business School , which shows: “Spending money on others makes us happier than spending that same amount of money on ourselves. What’s fascinating is that this effect has been replicated across cultures and income levels, suggesting that the happiness benefits of giving are universal and deeply rooted in human nature.” The language of boundaries – and the attendant motives for and consequences of laying them out, which are not giving a fuck and being disliked – tends not to speak of money. Clayton has thoughts on the way fawners annihilate themselves by giving away all their money (she describes one client who was found to be distributing 82% of her disposable income on others). Generally, though, the parables of the successful boundary are described through emotional dynamics – a careless family, an undermining boss, a self-involved partner. The lessons of the successful “let them”/“fuck them” relationship are to deprioritise the unsatisfying. It’s not that generosity is considered in these equations and found to be less important, rather that the circuitry is never activated. The courage to be disliked? … Zoe Williams tells it like it is. Composite: Guardian Design;  David Levene “There’s also lots of work showing that our social connection is super important for happiness,” Santos writes. She points to a 2002 study published by the Association for Psychological Science journal that found that social connection was a necessary condition for being truly happy with life. “I worry that some of these individualist, self-reliant strategies miss that,” she says. Robbins, with her immense engagement on social media, has been challenged on this, and writes in her book: “Some people have shared that they feel lonely after using the Let Them Theory. If you’re feeling this way, it’s a sign that you’re applying the theory incorrectly.” It’s not a pass to ghost people who are getting on your nerves, it’s an invitation to take responsibility for what you want and pursue it. If you end up lonely, it’s because you’re not taking enough responsibility (surely you didn’t want to be lonely?). What self-reliance theory, even the best of it, doesn’t address is just how much social connection starts with something you don’t especially want to do. For example, on a very regular basis, you’ll probably have to leave the house in inclement weather. It’s been interesting to watch the evolution of comfort narratives, especially on social media – first discernible in the “hygge” fetish of 2016 (when it was shortlisted for Oxford Dictionary’s word of the year), an endless croon to the Scandi lifestyle of log fires, cosy socks, dimmed lights and not seeing anyone. Since then, it’s been problematised by reality – loneliness levels are rising . If history is made by people who show up, so is community. Taoic and Indic religions form a lot of the scaffolding of self-reliance, whether it’s the shaman who shows up for one of Clayton’s ex-fawner clients (to be real, this ends in a lovely story about some baby bears), the young Zen monks of Nguyen’s anti-thinking strategy, or a guest appearance from the actual Buddha, who, according to Manson, from a theological and philosophical perspective, didn’t give a fuck. This isn’t new. “Historically,” the eco-philosopher Rupert Read says, “religion and spirituality have been used again and again to promote resignation and fatalism. When you detach these religions and spiritualities from their cultural milieu, it’s quite easy to transform them into something that’s against their intent. There is a deep way in which a more communal and collective orientation towards life is prevalent in eastern cultures. Without that, practises of meditation and mindfulness come to seem like tools for individual self-development – sometimes for self-help, sometimes in a business context.” It boils down to this – the measure of mental health in a person is the degree of their interest in others Manu Bazzano is a psychotherapist who trained as an Adlerian and is also a Zen priest. “The funny thing is, in Zen practice, a good inner experience comes when we start doing something for other people – allow in concern for other people’s suffering and distress, and there is a lightening of my obsessive concern for myself.” So what is the end point of having the “courage to be disliked”? Congratulations, you now care so little about other people (their opinions, their feelings, their perspectives) that you no longer care about the past. Kishimi and Koga quote Adler in their book: “Trauma does not exist … no experience is in itself a cause of our success or failure.” “The self is determined, not by our experiences themselves but by the meaning we give them .” (These are Kishimi and Koga’s italics). This is indivisible from Nguyen’s ideas, and it’s true, Adler definitely did say that. Again, though, some context has been lost: Adler may have been relentlessly goal-oriented, but he was also “almost like a lefty, socialist counterpoint to Freud”, Bazzano says. The technical word for a sense of community, connectedness or belonging as psychoanalytic quantities – gemeinschaftsgefühl – was invented by Adler, who would be rolling in his grave if he knew he was here cast as the grandfather of Being Disliked. In fact, Kishimi and Koga’s book does discuss finding meaning in being of use to others, but in such a way that has entirely removed the perspective of others, which is a bit like helping an old lady across a road without checking that’s what she wanted. She hates that. Read too much of it – which I definitely have – and it comes to sound a bit Trumpy “It boils down to this,” Bazzano says. “The measure of mental health in a person is the degree of their interest in others. That could be their neighbours, or it could be social and political.” Ah, politics; with the exception of Clayton, who delves very deeply into the structural forces informing much of our collective fawn behaviour, the rest of these authors enjoin you, whatever the politics you’re living under, to suck it up. They often start with an anecdote about their own a-materiality – welcome to their past life, they’re in $800,000 of debt (Robbins) or they’ve just sold all their stuff and moved to South America (Manson). It sounds bad, right? Yet “we are often actually happier with less”, Manson writes. Anticonsumerism is a familiar trope on the left, as it is closely allied to anticapitalism, but in the context of self-reliance manuals, its vibe is more “stop bleating, there is no such thing as a victim”. Read too much of it (which I definitely have), and it comes to sound a bit Trumpy (“maybe the children will have two dolls, instead of 30”). It’s obvious, in a way – if you’re looking out for number one, the last thing you want to do is get politically organised, and if you’re not going to organise, you need to accept what’s in front of you. “Overall,” Santos says, “we have a bias toward what Nicholas Epley calls ‘undersociality ’ – we are miscalibrated about how good all forms of connecting with others will make us feel.” Before you go all in on self-reliance, have you tried giving a fuck and being liked?",https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2025/oct/09/look-out-for-number-one-selfish-self-help-books-are-booming-but-will-they-improve-your-life,Health,BBC,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/15d812ab736709e95e9e7e59d9954283476dcc1c/0_0_2728_2182/master/2728.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=95780977fccdb5bf052a48f156e2c5d3",2025-10-09T04:00:14+00:00,47b0f9165899efc23fd56f47c2a015ec5f4d7ea3

Rates of bowel and colon cancer have been increasing over the last two decades. For Devi Sridhar , the chair of global public health at the University of Edinburgh, what we eat could be one of the main reasons.

The rise, she tells Nosheen Iqbal, isn’t just due to wider screening or better diagnosis, and it isn’t only found in one particular country, but across the developed world. Scientists have been looking for a likely culprit for a number of years and now, slowly, one is emerging: ultra-processed food.

4232e426f753,"Trump to visit Walter Reed for ‘routine yearly checkup’, the second since April",,"Donald Trump , the oldest man to be inaugurated US president, will visit Walter Reed national military medical center on Friday for what the White House said was a “routine yearly check up”. “On Friday morning, President Trump will visit Walter Reed Medical Center for a planned meeting and remarks with the troops,” the White House press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, said in a statement on Wednesday. “While there, President Trump will stop by for his routine yearly check up. He will then return to the White House.” This is the second time since returning to the White House in January that the president has gone to Walter Reed for an exam. Last time, it included cognitive and cardiology tests. It is not clear what exactly this checkup will entail. According to a memo from the president’s physician, Dr Sean Barbabella, Trump underwent his “ annual physical examination ” at Walter Reed on 11 April. The health report, released by the White House, declared Trump “fully fit to execute the duties” of the presidency. It suggested the president’s “frequent victories in golf events” contributed to his “excellent” physical and mental wellbeing. The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Leavitt said Trump was “considering going to the Middle East shortly” after his consultation on Friday. The president had said earlier on Wednesday that he was contemplating a trip to Egypt this weekend as he sought to finalize a deal to end the two-year war in Gaza. Since his April exam, Trump was diagnosed with chronic venous insufficiency , a condition that can cause swelling, as the president has experienced in his legs and is common in older adults. Trump’s physician also addressed concern about bruising on the president’s hand, attributing it to irritation caused by frequent handshaking and his use of aspirin as a standard cardiovascular prevention regimen. Recent images of a purplish bruise on Trump’s hand, which appeared to have been covered with a patch of makeup, fueled online speculation that the president was ill. Trump has long been cagey about his health, and concern about the president’s wellbeing stretches back to his first term. But wild rumors reached a fever pitch when the president faded from public view for several days over the summer, with critics and TikTok influencers speculating that the president was on his deathbed. “NEVER FELT BETTER IN MY LIFE!” Trump wrote at the time, in an assertion that only fueled suspicions of a cover-up. Questions about the 79-year-old president’s mental acuity have flared in recent weeks following a series of bizarre , rambling appearances and erratic online behavior.",https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/08/donald-trump-walter-reed-checkup,Health,BBC,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/05d0e5e22fbfd62eace18487892d5aeab683d646/26_0_1566_1253/master/1566.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=8e96db4d597cb43373f7b4b324af8f4a",2025-10-08T23:50:33+00:00,e433e281c7139b27e8fbb30e5311cfc53769fb20
c779d9032539,NHS could pay 25% more for medicines under plan to end row with drugmakers and Trump,,"Ministers are preparing to raise the amount the NHS pays pharmaceutical firms for medicines by up to 25% after weeks of intensive talks with the Donald Trump administration and drugmakers. Labour has drawn up fresh proposals to end a standoff with the industry over drug pricing , including changing the cost-effectiveness thresholds under which new medications are assessed for use on the NHS, according to industry sources. The row has been cited as one of the reasons why big companies in the sector, including MSD (known as Merck in the US) and AstraZeneca, have cancelled or paused investments in the UK in recent weeks, while ramping up investments in the US. The Department of Health and Social Care is in a standoff with the Treasury and No 10 on how to fund the deal, with Downing Street resisting pressure to commit new funds for medicines in next month’s budget. The Liberal Democrats immediately criticised the move, first reported by Politico, asking how much it would cost and whether it would lead to cuts elsewhere in the NHS . The science secretary, Patrick Vallance, has publicly acknowledged that the UK’s spending on new medicines needs to rise from 9% of overall NHS spend, which is below drug spending in the US and many other European countries. The main element of the plan is thought to include raising the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (Nice) cost-effectiveness threshold by 25%, which has been unchanged since 1999. Under current rules, Nice considers a medicine costing between £20,000 and £30,000 for every extra year of good-quality life it provides a patient to represent good value for money for the NHS. The Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry on Tuesday reiterated its call for “urgent action” on drug pricing, saying the Nice threshold should be increased as soon as possible in line with inflation to between £40,000 and £50,000, and index-linked thereafter. Making this change would, over time, lead to a greater share of the NHS budget being allocated to medicines, and additional funding would be needed to support this. In talks over the summer, Wes Streeting, the health secretary, proposed a deal that would save the pharmaceutical industry £1bn over three years, with billions more promised over the coming decade. But the industry argued that it was forecast to make repayments totalling £13.5bn over the same period and has been demanding about £2.5bn a year extra. A government source said ministers were prepared to spend more on medicines as they increasingly became more ​innovative and preventive. They cited the example of weight loss injections – which are forecast to save the NHS billions of pounds in treating obesity and associated health problems – and trials for cancer-preventing vaccines. The patient-led campaign group Just Treatment called it “deeply troubling news for patients and the NHS”, adding: “We are at risk of importing America’s disastrous drug pricing crisis.” It called on the government to “take steps to establish a system for developing and manufacturing medicines that puts patients first”. The NHS spent £20.6bn on medicines and medical devices in 2023-24, up from £19.2bn the year before. Trump has put pressure on pharma companies to lower their drug prices in the US and increase them elsewhere, accusing other countries of “freeloading” on high US prices. Nearly two weeks ago, he threatened to impose 100% tariffs on pharmaceutical imports from 1 October to ramp up the pressure, although these did not materialise. In response to pressure from Trump, Pfizer and several other US and European companies, including the UK’s biggest drugmaker, AstraZeneca, have started to cut their prices in the US and to sell directly to patients to cut out costly middlemen. skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Business Today Get set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morning Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Last week, Varun Chandra, Starmer’s main business adviser, flew to Washington DC for talks with senior US officials and drug companies, the latest in a series of visits to try to hammer out a deal on pricing and tariffs. A UK government spokesperson said: “We’ve secured a landmark economic partnership with the US that includes working together on pharmaceutical exports from the UK whilst improving conditions for pharmaceutical companies here. “We’re now in advanced discussions with the US administration to secure the best outcome for the UK, reflecting our strong relationship and the opportunities from close partnership with our pharmaceutical industry.” However, the Lib Dem health and social care spokesperson, Helen Morgan, said: “It beggars belief that the government is bending to a bullying US president having told patients for years that life-saving new drugs are unaffordable. “Ministers must come clean about how much this move will cost and whether it will be funded by cuts elsewhere in the NHS. They should also lay their plans before parliament without delay so they can be properly scrutinised. It increasingly feels like this government puts the whims of Trump before everything else – even our precious NHS.” The pharma sector’s negotiations with the UK government over drug pricing under a voluntary scheme broke down without an agreement in late August. Since then, MSD has abandoned plans for a £1bn research centre in London and AstraZeneca and New York-based Eli Lilly have paused projects, taking total pharma investments that are on hold or cancelled to nearly £2bn since the start of this year.

Turn on, tune in and drop off",,"Re your article ( Why do I keep waking up at 2am – and how do I get back to sleep?, 1 October ), I too have maintenance insomnia and used to spend the wee small hours ruminating on all kinds of real or imagined worries. Then radio on demand changed my life. Your brain simply can’t process two things at once, and I now I have a wealth of shows to choose from that have my attention and prevent the anxiety from creeping in. I still miss some sleep, but I enjoy the time that I have listening to all the shows I never have time to devote attention to during the day. And I often drop off again mid‑programme without the worry of finding my “page” again, as with an audiobook. It might be worth a try for others. Gillian Greenfield Haydon Bridge, Northumberland Before artificial light became commonplace, split sleep patterns were normal for young adults. At times when it was necessary for some people to be awake and watchful, adolescents would take the early watch and go to bed late. Older adults would go to sleep and get up early to take the third watch. Young adults would take the middle shift, waking up after a few hours sleep to keep watch in the middle of the night. They would then go back to sleep again. Real life is, of course, a lot more complex than that, but we still have natural biorhythms that change as we age. The answer is to follow your natural biorhythms rather than fight against them.

c2fa490b69fc,Peter Whybrow obituary,,"In the mid-1980s, the neuropsychiatrist Peter Whybrow, who has died aged 86, and his colleague Marc Bauer encountered a strange case involving a 41-year-old doctor. Ten years previously he had had a suspected pre-cancerous cold thyroid nodule surgically removed. After eight years he began to behave extremely erratically, going out at night and not coming home despite being married with children. Then he would go to bed for a week and not get up, and lost his job. His family forced him to see a psychiatrist, who diagnosed him with manic depression and put him on lithium. However, his rapid cycling between depression and mania did not improve, and withdrawing from lithium made him wildly manic. He was referred to Whybrow’s Malignant Bipolar Illness Clinic at the University of Pennsylvania, in Philadelphia. There a high dose of thyroxine – the hormone created in the thyroid gland, which controls how much energy the body uses – was added to the lithium the patient was given. This immediately led to a cessation of rapid mood cycling and to long-term stability in managing his bipolar disorder. Whybrow and Bauer’s treatment has since been replicated in many bipolar patients suffering from rapid cycling and other variants of severe and intractable bipolar illness. Many, but not all, of these patients are pre-menopausal women, where their bipolar disorder is driven by oestrogen-thyroid hormone interaction in the brain. In bipolar disease, too little thyroxine is circulating, and when a woman is pre-menopausal, the oestrous cycle fosters rapid cycling. This is particularly difficult for some vulnerable, still menstruating young women, whose thyroid axis collapses when given lithium. Whybrow and colleagues’ clinical trials showed that when these young women were given high doses of thyroxine, about 75% of them became much better. Born in Hatfield, Hertfordshire, Peter was the son of Doris (nee Abbott) and Charles Whybrow. His father was an excellent oboist who became a tank commander in the second world war, and lost his embouchure, and so his ability to play. Peter watched his father deal with the trauma of war with the help of the local family doctor, and felt drawn to a life in medicine. From Welwyn grammar school he went to University College London to train as a doctor. He especially enjoyed surgery, and studied thyroid carcinoma with Eric Pochin, head of the Medical Research Council Unit. When the thyroid was removed, patients were given radioactive iodine to kill cancer cells. This treatment works well for six months, but deprives the body of thyroxine. In those days, doctors did not have T3 (triiodothyronine), which is now used now as a substitute. So patients would become profoundly hypothyroid during their six to seven months of treatment. At the end of this treatment, the patients often became altogether different people, but no one knew why. A diplomat confided to Whybrow that when deprived of thyroxine in the phase after surgery, he was unable to calculate anything and became completely dependent on his staff. In fact, many patients complained of being unable to think and becoming melancholic. This conundrum of whether hypothyroidism could masquerade as a mood disorder kickstarted Whybrow’s lifelong interest in research on the brain-thyroid axis. In 1962, while still a medical student, he published his first scientific article in University College Hospital magazine, on peyote, the psychedelic cactus. It demonstrated how medicine not only works through its pharmacology but is always rooted in beliefs and cultural context. He went on to pursue a different kind of psychiatry, focused on treating patients in an integrative fashion, rooted in fundamental medical research but always using evidence from interdisciplinary social and anthropological research. Whybrow published his first scientific article in University College Hospital magazine on peyote, the psychedelic cactus. Photograph: Martin Bond/Alamy In 1965 Whybrow took a psychiatry residency at the University of North Carolina, where he met Arthur Prange. They collaborated on how an individual experiences hypothyroidism and whether this experience overlaps with depression. In those days, chemical tests for thyroid disease were not widely available, and in rural North Carolina people became rather ill before diagnosis. The researchers found that hypothyroidism can indeed mimic psychiatric illnesses, particularly cognitive dysfunction and mood disturbances, and that sometimes patients can become quasi-psychotic, a condition referred to as “myxedema madness”. After Whybrow returned to the Medical Research Council Depression Unit in the UK in 1968, Prange joined him on a sabbatical. They showed that supplementing antidepressant treatments with thyroid hormone medication was particularly useful for women, and that the level of thyroid hormone circulating in the bloodstream is correlated with how quickly people recover from depression. Depressed patients with elevated levels of thyroid hormone in their bloodstream are much more likely to benefit from antidepressant drugs. Because women’s thyroid function deteriorates as they age, and because they have poorer thyroid function than men, women are much more likely to be helped by adjunctive thyroid hormones. These findings have significantly helped clinicians treat mood disorders, especially in women. In 1969 Whybrow moved with his wife, Ruth (nee Steele), whom he had married in 1962, and their daughters, Kate and Helen, to New Hampshire for an assistant professorship at Dartmouth Medical School. By the age of 31 he was chairman of the department of psychiatry, and went on to be executive dean of the whole medical school. In 1984 Whybrow went back to psychiatry at the University of Pennsylvania, and developed his insights into mood cycling. In 1997 he moved to the University of California, Los Angeles, and for 23 years combined the three roles of executive chair of psychiatry, director of the Semel Institute for Neuroscience and Human Behavior, and chief executive of the Resnick Neuropsychiatric hospital. Thus he was able to create one of the world’s leading centres for psychiatric research and treatment, combining neuroscience, genetics, and behavioural science with patient care and training. From the late 1990s, he and Michael Bauer took the brain-thyroid work forward, notably with applying novel brain imaging technology to demonstrate that thyroxine modulates metabolism in limbic brain regions that are responsible for regulating human emotions. Another important outcome of their collaboration was the development of ChronoRecord, the first electronically based daily self-rating system through which patients may follow the course of their illness and recovery in accurate correlation with treatment, thus facilitating long-term therapeutic management of affective illness. In his book A Mood Apart: A Thinker’s Guide to Emotion and Its Disorder (1997), he explores the subject of human emotion and the widely misunderstood illnesses of depression and mania, guiding the reader in how to identify mood disorder and what to do when it emerges. It was the first of a trilogy exploring the impact of modern-day culture on human behaviour. American Mania: When More Is Not Enough (2005) and The Well-Tuned Brain: Neuroscience and the Life Well Lived (2015) explore the link between neuropsychiatric research on health and illness to larger cultural themes, such as making a connection between “manic” behaviour and America’s history as a migrant culture, and proposing potential solutions. In 2020 Whybrow collaborated with me in founding the Centre for Eudaimonia and Human Flourishing at Oxford University, eudaimonia being the classical Greek concept of living well. Its research expands his ideas of balancing brain and body with the use of whole-brain models of malign brain states that may in time benefit neuropsychiatric patients. His first marriage ended in divorce, as did his marriage to Eva Redei in 1998. In 2014 he married his long-term partner Nancy Main; she died in 2017.

4dba773b0514,Iain Coleman obituary,,"Iain Coleman, the former MP for Hammersmith and Fulham, who has died aged 67, was renowned within his west London constituency for a policy of free social care provision at home, something he had fought to introduce in the area during his leadership of the local council in the 1990s before he was elected to parliament in the Labour landslide of 1997. Through a cruel irony, the series of strokes that curtailed his active political career meant that he himself would latterly become a major beneficiary of this very scheme. His socialist politics were fired by an inherent social compassion and a conscientious concern for those – in particular, homeless people – he thought had been left behind by society, and he dedicated his working life to attempting to use political power in order to improve the lives of others. Coleman’s first job on leaving school had been as a care worker in a care home in Kent, the county where he was raised. Subsequently he was employed as a local government officer in the London boroughs of Ealing (from 1986) and then Islington (from 1990), contemporaneously with his first 13 years as an elected councillor in Hammersmith and Fulham. After an initial succession of strokes in 2004 he retired from parliament at the general election the following year, but returned to office as a councillor in the borough from 2010 until 2014. Coleman was widely recognised as a highly skilful political strategist. He worked hard, was an effective council leader (from 1991 until 1996) and did a great deal to advance the Labour party cause in the highly marginal borough. He was what is known in political circles, usually admiringly, as an operator – someone who could make things happen through manoeuvring behind the scenes. When first elected as a councillor in 1986, he won the two-member Avonmore ward from the Conservatives with Sally Powell, who became his wife in 1996. They formed a powerful political duo on the council, where Coleman became the leader, and mayor in 1996-97, while Powell chaired the environment committee and then chair of planning. She later became a member of Labour’s national executive. Coleman was born in Hammersmith, the second son and middle of three children of Pamela (nee Betts) and Ronald Coleman. His father was a businessman, later the chief executive of Ann Summers, and both parents were then Conservative supporters. The family lived in Tunbridge Wells, Kent, and Iain and his elder brother, Neale, were both educated at Tonbridge school. Iain credited the history teacher there for his introduction to socialism. Neale also entered Labour politics as an elected Westminster city councillor, and as a policy adviser both to Ken Livingstone, when mayor of London, and the former Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn. Their mother switched her allegiance to Labour, was elected as a councillor in Barnet, north London, in 1990 and served as mayor of Barnet in 1997. Iain did not do well in the classroom and left school before studying for A-levels. It was only as an adult, when his six-year-old son received a diagnosis of dyspraxia, which affects co-ordination skills, that he learned that he also suffered from the same condition. It did provide an explanation of why he had taken the driving test 45 times before eventually securing a pass. On the crest of the wave that swept Tony Blair into power, Coleman won the newly created seat of Hammersmith and Fulham with a majority of 3,842. In a maiden speech on local government finance, he sought to explain the socially divergent nature of his constituency, telling MPs that the borough he had so recently led suffered great poverty. The glitzy wine bars and expensive restaurants of the borough were balanced by the fact that 35% of households were dependent on benefit, 53% of primary schoolchildren were entitled to free school meals – double the national average – and the death rate of men under the age of 60 was 60% higher than average. Coleman was a diligent MP and a powerful voice for his constituency. The other principle issues he espoused were the Palestinian cause and the future of Ireland. He had a close circle of friends in Labour politics, but, perhaps predictably, given his strong convictions, did not see eye to eye with everyone. He had a strong sense of fun, enjoyed cooking and was a passionately enthusiastic supporter of Arsenal FC. In 2001, he narrowly held his seat, by 2,015 votes. After leaving parliament, he recovered from his first strokes but after a further incidence and a total of 20 strokes succumbed to early onset dementia. His wife wrote a powerful letter , published in the Guardian shortly before last year’s general election, arguing for the inclusion of free social care to be included in the party’s manifesto and enacted by every local authority. Coleman is survived by Sally and their son, Jack, and by his brother, Neale, and sister, Helen.",https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/oct/08/iain-coleman-obituary,Health,BBC,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3489f116d1e0c34dd3f15dcc16e34a1038cf321f/993_166_767_613/master/767.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=2cddb8b132063b95eae074637355d383",2025-10-08T13:44:28+00:00,8ec3830deca314163f7cb4b70062a5b37a3a2a8d
bbee4c581d11,Brazilian governor apologies after joking about deadly methanol poisoning crisis,,"São Paulo’s teetotal governor, Tarcísio de Freitas, has been forced to apologise after responding to a deadly methanol poisoning crisis by joking that he would only start worrying when bootleggers began making fake Coca-Cola. Freitas, a close ally of the former far-right president Jair Bolsonaro , made the comment during a press conference about his response to an alcohol contamination scandal focused on his state that has killed at least three people. The victims include a 30-year-old mother who died after drinking a vodka and fruit juice cocktail at a party. Brazil’s health minister, Alexandre Padilha, a doctor, has urged citizens to avoid white spirits such as vodka and gin until authorities discover the source of the tainted drinks. “We’re not talking about an essential product in people’s lives,” Padilha said last week. On Monday, Freitas appeared to make light of the situation as he described the concerns of manufacturers of spirits such as Jack Daniel’s and Johnnie Walker had over the illegal counterfeiting of their products. “[Alcohol] isn’t my cup of tea,” said the presidential hopeful. “The day they start faking Coca-Cola is the day I’ll worry. It’s just as well they haven’t reached this point yet,” Freitas added with an awkward smile. The remark went viral and unleashed a torrent of criticism, with many comparing it to Bolsonaro’s callous and incompetent response to Covid, which killed more than 700,000 Brazilians. “So what? I’m sorry. What do you want me to do?” Bolsonaro asked a reporter in April 2020 when asked about the fast-rising death toll. A year later, with more than 260,000 dead, Bolsonaro told citizens to stop “whining” . Freitas – who hopes to inherit Bolsonaro’s political movement after his mentor’s recent sentencing to 27 years in prison for plotting a military coup – voiced regret for his comments on Tuesday. He admitted “cracking a joke” to lighten the mood but claimed his words had been “really misinterpreted”. “I ask for forgiveness, from the families who are suffering after losing loved-ones [and] from business owners whose businesses are suffering,” said Freitas, who many expect to challenge the leftwing incumbent, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva , for the presidency in next year’s election.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/oct/08/brazilian-governor-tarcisio-de-freitas-apologies-after-joking-about-deadly-methanol-poisoning-crisis,Health,BBC,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d571e9fc3ea487270d4911426255e43d836368a1/0_177_1311_1048/master/1311.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=fb4dfb1ccfc1023f5b47cca4bf28996e",2025-10-08T12:58:58+00:00,01bfeb54d5e7ab2fcc4e78b08b51d422e20694d0
a0b858ae5412,McTominay and Adams strike as dismal Scotland edge out Belarus and seal playoff slot,,"Someone within Hampden Park had the temerity to blast Freed From Desire over the public address system at full time. A song normally reserved for euphoric moments only just drowned out the jeers that met a Scotland victory. People just want more and more? Too right they do. Steve Clarke and his players edged closer to the World Cup with this win. It was just that a return to that scene for the first time since 1998 felt a million miles away as the Scots limped and laboured past Belarus. “We know we have got to be better, man,” admitted Scott McTominay. The Napoli midfielder was even more profound as he scored Scotland’s second; latter word “me” and the first a rhyme with “duck.” McTominay’s lack of celebrations perfectly depicted Scotland’s messy night. Clarke is fiercely protective of his squad. To the Scotland manager’s credit, he refused to sugarcoat what played out here. A clearly furious Clarke was withering in his criticism. “I am really, really disappointed,” he said. “As disappointed as I have been during 72 games in charge. We just didn’t turn up. The performance was way below par. It is head-scratching.” Perhaps, yet it must be remembered Scotland were outplayed even in beating Greece on Thursday. There is a caveat and an important one. Scotland’s overall qualifying position is strong. They have taken 10 points from a possible 12. “The players know what my feelings are but I have great faith in them, I trust them completely,” Clarke added. “I am very confident they will be in a much better place next month. They have never let me down before and I am confident they will not next month.” Amid the bad vibes, Denmark’s win over Greece in Copenhagen meant Scotland have secured at worst a World Cup playoff berth. Yet so many questions were raised by this Scottish showing. They were unconvincing in defence, lacking authority in midfield and woefully ponderous in attack. A capacity crowd, who arrived for a box-ticking exercise, grew increasingly edgy. Should Scotland progress to the World Cup and produce anything remotely approaching this, they will be also-rans. Belarus, the 100th-ranked team in the world and a side knocked for six at home by Denmark three days earlier, were the more fluent for concerted spells. The visitors managed 22 shots on goal, were denied a second-half equaliser by a debatable VAR intervention and had the Scots clinging on for dear life by the end. Scott McTominay (left) doubles Scotland’s lead over Belarus, but they were still made to endure a tense finale. Photograph: Owen Humphreys/PA “In my opinion we deserved to at least draw this game,” said the Belarus coach, Carlos Alós. Not even those with tartan lenses on their specs could argue. There had been warning signs for Scotland in the opening exchanges. It was just that nobody bothered to heed them. Scott McKenna had to scramble away a teasing German Barkovskiy cross, Kenny McLean had to block Evgeni Yablonski’s shot and Pavel Zabelin sent a free header over the Scotland bar – all within 11 minutes. Ché Adams slamming home with his left foot after collecting a Jack Hendry pass for the opener – although it was originally ruled out for offside and needed a VAR review to stand – should have settled nerves, but Clarke cut an agitated figure for the remainder of the first half. Ben Gannon-Doak, Scotland’s bright young forward hope, was guilty of poor decision-making time and again. skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Football Daily Kick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of football Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The 63rd minute brought an even more crucial intervention by officialdom. Yevgeny Malashevich spun off Andy Robertson, met Barkovski’s cross and flicked beyond Angus Gunn. The Romanian referee Marian Barbu decreed upon second glance that McTominay was fouled on the halfway line as Belarus snatched possession. It was a borderline call and an embarrassing scenario for the Scots to be in. “If that stands, I am not sure we would have got ourselves back in front,” said Clarke later. Alós refused to make an issue of the decision. McTominay has been well short of his best throughout this Scottish campaign. He did, however, allow his country breathing space after Aleksandr Martynovich failed to clear Robertson’s cross from the Scotland left. Anyone who anticipated Clarke’s men easing over the line from there was to be swiftly dissuaded from that notion. The final act of the night, quite rightly, belonged to Belarus. Robertson was left for dust by Hleb Kuchko in the sixth added minute of eight. He finished smartly underneath the advancing Gunn. Clarke dismissed the sense that nerves played a part in Scotland’s approach. In fact, he swatted aside any potential excuse floated towards him. “Maybe I’ll go back to the hotel and have a quiet beer,” said Scotland’s manager. It was a night for more than one. Scotland must hope this is a game they never require to speak of ever again.",https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/oct/12/world-cup-qualifier-group-c-scotland-belarus-match-report,Sport,BBC,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5639d210855a02419a53bced0700e309239b76cb/500_0_5000_4000/master/5000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=de8f850338189f2a1ec3f8f180dfb364",2025-10-12T20:57:55+00:00,a657e3bfecd58d3a623ca037c87770fd15ef90af
96f99771a3b1,NFL roundup: Hapless Jets manage minus-10 passing yards; Panthers upset Cowboys,,"Denver Broncos 13-11 New York Jets Bo Nix threw an early touchdown pass, Wil Lutz kicked a late go-ahead field goal and the Denver Broncos sacked Justin Fields nine times, with the final one sealing an ugly 13-11 victory over the winless New York Jets on Sunday. The Broncos (4-2) won their third in a row, but found themselves trailing 11-10 after conceding a safety in the third quarter against a Jets team that managed just 82 total net yards on offense. Nix, who was 19 of 30 for 174 yards, led Denver on a 12-play, 65-yard drive that ended with Lutz’s 27-yard field with just over five minutes left. Despite a horrendous offensive display, the Jets (0-6) still had the ball with a chance to drive for a potential winning score. But Fields was sacked by Jonathon Cooper and Justin Strnad on fourth-and-eight from the Denver 44 after Aaron Glenn opted to go for it rather than send out Nick Folk for a long field-goal attempt. Folk had successfully converted all three of his field goals. Fields struggled all game, completing nine of 17 passes for just 45 yards. The Jets finished with minus-10 net yards passing, the fewest in any game since the Chargers had minus-19 against the Kansas City Chiefs in 1998. “Our passing game was non-existent,” Glenn said after the game. Dallas Cowboys 27–30 Carolina Panthers Rico Dowdle went over 200 yards from scrimmage for the second straight week – this time against his former team – and rookie Ryan Fitzgerald kicked a 33-yard field goal as time expired as the Carolina Panthers (3-3) defeated the Dallas Cowboys (2-3-1) in a wild back-and-forth. Bryce Young completed 17 of 25 passes for 199 yards and threw two of his three touchdown passes to rookie Tetairoa McMillan. The Panthers improved to 3-0 at home. Dowdle ran for 183 yards on 30 carries and caught four passes for 56 yards and a touchdown for the Panthers. Los Angeles Rams 17–3 Baltimore Ravens The Los Angeles Rams (4-2) finished the first half with a goalline stand and then Matthew Stafford guided them to a pair of touchdowns to begin the third quarter in their victory over the Baltimore Ravens (1-5). The Rams weren’t at their best, but they didn’t have to be against a spiraling Baltimore team who were without injured quarterback Lamar Jackson for a second straight weekend. The Ravens managed a field goal on their first drive and nothing more. It was tied at 3-3 late in the first half when the Ravens had first-and-goal from the four-yard line. The Rams stopped four straight runs. Arizona Cardinals 27–31 Indianapolis Colts Daniel Jones threw two touchdown passes and Jonathan Taylor ran for the go-ahead score with 4:32 left, giving the Indianapolis Colts (5-1) victory over the Arizona Cardinals (2-4). Jones finished 22 of 30 for 212 yards with one interception. He also ran for a score. Taylor had 21 carries for 123 yards, and rookie tight end Tyler Warren caught six passes for 63 yards and a touchdown. Indy remained perfect at home by winning their sixth straight at Lucas Oil Stadium. Arizona lost their fourth straight, blowing a fourth-quarter lead for the second consecutive week. Seattle Seahawks 20–12 Jacksonville Jaguars Sam Darnold threw touchdown passes to Jaxon Smith-Njigba and Cooper Kupp, and Seattle dominated both lines of scrimmage on their way to victory. Smith-Njigba finished with eight receptions for 162 yards as the Seahawks (4-2) rebounded from a last-second loss to Tampa Bay at home. They had few issues traveling cross-country for an early start, controlled most of the way and improved to 22-6 over the last decade in 1pm kickoffs on the East Coast. The Jaguars (4-2), meanwhile, looked every bit like a team that spent the week reveling in a Monday night victory against Kansas City. Cleveland Browns 9–23 Pittsburgh Steelers Aaron Rodgers passed for 235 yards and two touchdowns, and the Pittsburgh Steelers (4-1) had little trouble with the Cleveland Browns (1-5). The Steelers strengthened their early grip on the AFC North by continuing their home mastery of the Browns. Cleveland’s regular-season losing streak at Acrisure Stadium hit 22 games after another lifeless performance by its offense. Browns rookie Dillon Gabriel passed for 221 yards but couldn’t lead the league’s second-lowest scoring offense to the end zone as Cleveland failed to crack the 17-point barrier for the 11th consecutive game. Rodgers threw TD passes to Connor Heyward and DK Metcalf. Los Angeles Chargers 29–27 Miami Dolphins Justin Herbert escaped the Dolphins’ pass rush and connected with Ladd McConkey for a 42-yard catch-and-run in the final minute. That set up Cameron Dicker’s fifth field goal of the game, and the Los Angeles Chargers (4-2) rallied to beat Miami. The Dolphins overcame a 10-point deficit in the fourth quarter and took the lead when Tua Tagovailoa threw a one-yard touchdown pass to Darren Waller with 46 seconds remaining. Nyheim Hines set the Chargers up at Miami’s 35 with a 40-yard return of the ensuing kickoff. Then Herbert found McConkey and Dicker’s 33-yard kick won it for Los Angeles, who snapped a two-game skid. The Dolphins (1-5) were booed off the field at Hard Rock Stadium. New England Patriots 25-19 New Orleans Saints Drake Maye passed for 261 yards and three touchdowns and the visiting New England Patriots defeated the New Orleans Saints. Maye completed 18 of 26 passes as the Patriots (4-2) matched their win total from last season while improving to 3-0 on the road. Spencer Rattler completed 20 of 26 for 227 yards but no touchdowns and Blake Grupe kicked four field goals for the Saints (1-5).",https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/oct/12/nfl-football-sunday-scores,Sport,BBC,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/167cda94ccbc3ab4d2ff0c0dc2a745d6a13e2779/1038_585_5018_4015/master/5018.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=d2d1044d7e84f01573a8a47e05ead011",2025-10-12T20:23:30+00:00,7aec76d4f780e13ca9236cb3d9fa8a7b56bef898
27ed1664a858,Australia chase down record score to defeat India in Women’s Cricket World Cup epic,,"Australia completed a record women’s one-day international chase as Alyssa Healy’s commanding 142 powered the defending champions to a three-wicket win over India on Sunday. Set 331 for victory in the Women’s Cricket World Cup group-phase game, Australia reached their target with six balls to spare after Ellyse Perry guided her side home with an unbeaten 47 alongside Kim Garth. The victory, their third in four matches, lifted Australia to the top of the standings while the hosts, India, are third after a second straight defeat, having lost to South Africa earlier in the tournament. The top four teams qualify for the semi-finals . Healy set the tone for the chase, sharing a brisk opening stand with Phoebe Litchfield and later a crucial partnership with Ashleigh Gardner (45), before falling, with Australia still needing 66 from 68 balls. Perry, who had earlier retired hurt with cramps, returned late in the innings to guide Australia over the line. “Really proud of the group,” said Healy. “A little bit tight at the back end. We have been preaching about the depth in our lineup, the fact that we could chase 330 [proved it]. “Full credit to our bowlers for pulling it back; we could have been chasing 360-plus. I was trying to lock in for a big day. To contribute heavily was great, I would have liked to stay a bit longer but the girls got the job done.” The chase eclipsed the 302 made by Sri Lanka to beat South Africa at Potchefstroom in April 2024. Earlier, Smriti Mandhana and Pratika Rawal shared a 155-run opening stand to put India on course for a huge total before a collapse in which they lost nine wickets for 138 to finish on 330. Annabel Sutherland’s five-wicket haul had triggered their slide. skip past newsletter promotion Subscribe to our cricket newsletter for our writers' thoughts on the biggest stories and a review of the week’s action Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

fc6e1de68e95,Magical Marcus Smith inspires Harlequins to derby victory over Saracens,,"Ordinarily a game‑winning performance from Marcus Smith worth 15 points would include a dozen line‑breaks, several offloads and more hot steps than a Motown nightclub. And while the England star dazzled in patches with ball in hand, it was his composed kicking that was the difference as Harlequins beat Saracens 20-14 in a scrappy but enjoyable London derby. Smith launched raking kicks into space. He hoisted contestable spirals into pale blue skies. He dinked over the top of rushing defenders. His first‑half try came off a hoof into Saracens’ red zone, one that caused chaos in the backfield. Chandler Cunningham-South gathered the loose ball and bulldozed over the gain line. Shortly after, Smith, on the front foot, wriggled past a tackler to score from five metres out. “He’s a British & Irish Lion,” Smith’s coach, Jason Gilmore, pointed out. “He gives us that game management. It’s something we’ve struggled with in the past two weeks.” Saracens were pinned in their own patch and struggled to get out. The mood of the match was summed up when another Smith bomb was shelled by Owen Farrell on the Saracens 22. Though the home side could not convert from the scrum, they maintained their territorial hold over their guests. Despite their dominance, Harlequins were not stretching their lead and it was wiped out when Saracens scored a screamer from their own half. At first receiver off the back of a scrum, Farrell pirouetted and delivered a gorgeous offload for Lucio Cinti who galloped up field. The Argentinian jinked left then right before stitching an offload of his own for the supporting Fergus Burke. Smith thought he had a second try after selling a dummy pass and bursting through a gap close to the Saracens line. Quins had nicked the ball off a defensive scrum but the ball had squirted out the side rather than through the No 8’s feet. Fin Baxter won a penalty off the very next scrum and Smith nudged over the penalty to take a 10-7 lead. Neither side managed to find much fluency in attack. At the 30-minute mark a packed Stoop witnessed 30 kicks from hand. Scrums needed restarting. Lineouts misfired. A brief exchange of shoves between Cunningham-South and Farrell brought one of the loudest cheers of the first half. Tyrone Green shows his delight after scoring Harlequins’ second try. Photograph: Andrew Matthews/PA Smith belted a high kick with his first touch after the break. Tyrone Green chased after it and put enough pressure on Burke for the ball bobble away. Green was first to react, hacking ahead and winning the race to the line. Smith’s extras opened up a 17-7 lead. “We got what we deserved but maybe we were lucky to get what we got,” said the Saracens director of rugby, Mark McCall, who gave his supporters some joy when he confirmed the return of Maro Itoje for next week. “Marcus kicked beautifully and put us under a lot of pressure.

With the forwards hammering away in the left corner, Harlequins defenders were sucked into the morass. Ben Earl was the one heavy who kept his distance, prowling the right wing. The cross‑field kick from Farrell could not have been better placed and in a flash the gap was reduced to three after a tough conversion from the tram. Harlequins had the game won when the debutant Boris Wenger burrowed over from close range following a lineout five metres out. But, for the second time in the game, the home crowd booed a chalked‑off try as replays showed the replacement prop had committed a double movement. More kicking took the game’s total tally beyond 50 with seven minutes remaining. Crucially it was Smith dictating the tempo in the closing stages. Men in white were kicking in desperation. Smith had it on a string, ensuring the clock ticked down with all the action taking place in Saracens’ third. A penalty for Smith on the final hooter was a fitting end. “It was a different way to win a game,” said Gilmore, who deserves credit for moving away from the club’s ingrained desire to play free‑flowing rugby. It might not have been a vintage show from the league’s entertainers, but it got the job done against their bitter city rivals.",https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/oct/12/harlequins-saracens-prem-rugby-union-match-report,Sport,BBC,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dda687ea385423e4a0024a75c05dfdbb5f57d114/97_0_2337_1869/master/2337.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=af67e69c100adfc8fdaf7f3d40ee53d0",2025-10-12T16:32:17+00:00,cc552a79d941eed43329a024bb2a68d727d2cee5
ab17c6f077c5,RFU could use ‘anti-pee paint’ to placate Twickenham locals in push for new licence,,"The Rugby Football Union has proposed using “anti-pee paint” that would leave public offenders “covered in their own urine”, to ease residents’ fears over plans to increase the number of music concerts staged at Twickenham’s Allianz Stadium. The RFU is seeking permission from Richmond council to stage up to 15 concerts a year, but the Guardian can reveal that it encountered another setback last week when it was determined that a limit of three concerts – and only one not on a Saturday – would remain as part of its new licence. The union has also encountered strong resistance from residents, many of whom are concerned with antisocial behaviour at England matches and late-night events. The decision to maintain the licensing limit has been described as “a significant victory for those who believe the RFU’s aspirations to [be] unreasonable and unsustainable”. The RFU has lamented how venues such as Wembley and the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium are able to generate significant revenue because of looser restrictions on non-sporting events, all the more so because the union wants to raise additional funds to pay for its planned £660m overhaul of Twickenham. The chief executive, Bill Sweeney, has suggested previously that the RFU could leave Twickenham and move to either Milton Keynes or Birmingham if it is not allowed to stage more concerts. At a council meeting last week to discuss the RFU’s application for a new licence, it emerged that 192 representations against the plans had been made as well as 13 in favour. Minutes of the meeting describe a complaint that “there are regularly drunken adults urinating on properties. There is also shouting, swearing and sometimes fighting in the streets”. One representation read: “The pavements and roads are unhygienic, and children are having to walk and scoot through dried urine and excrement,” while another provided evidence showing “urination and indecent exposure” on the individual’s property. In accompanying documents to the RFU’s submission for a new licence, the union sought to address recurring themes of residents’ concerns and how it deals with them. As well as portaloos in “known hotspots” and the presence of police officers who can issue fixed-penalty notices, the union states: “We have also recently been made aware of something called ‘anti‑pee paint’ (which has been used in, for example, Yorkshire and the London Borough of Camden). In short, if you relieve yourself against a wall, you will be covered in your own urine. It also prevents the odours associated by protecting the bricks. It is not a solution in itself, but we will always continue to try to find ways to prevent this behaviour where we can.” The RFU’s application to host more concerts is running in two parallel parts: licensing and planning. The previous licence dictated that the union could hold only three non‑sporting events per year and only one could be held on a day that is not a Saturday. The union’s application for a new licence left residents opposed to the plans amid fears it would give the RFU “carte blanche”. Residents also took issue with the RFU’s application to stage up to 36 smaller events, such as weddings, until 1.30am. In supporting documents, however, the RFU said it was not seeking to increase the number of concerts through its licensing application, insisting that it was a planning matter and it would be doing so via that avenue. Existing planning legislation states that the union can host three concerts a year but does not specify on which days of the week. The union was hoping to remove that stipulation from its new licence but Richmond council determined in its decision this past week that it would remain. Sweeney has previously expressed frustration at how “we could have had Beyoncé but she wanted three nights and we are only allowed two nights consecutively”. The restriction over which days of the week concerts can be performed at Twickenham was added in 2018 in the aftermath of an Eminem gig. As a result, the RFU received 93 complaints across 2018 and acknowledged “that it did present its own challenges, particularly around the issue of street cleaning/litter”. Beyoncé could have played at Twickenham in 2025 were it not for licence restrictions. Photograph: Samir Hussein/Getty Images The fact that Richmond council decided to explicitly state the limit of three concerts, and only one not on a Saturday, would be a part of the new licence – rather than leave it to the planning process – can therefore be considered a setback to the RFU. The union was successful in its application for smaller events and can still press ahead with its planning application, which is considered by insiders to be more significant than the licensing application. If the planning application for more concerts is successful, it is understood the RFU would then have to seek an amendment to the new licence it was granted last week. As reported by the Guardian last week, the union’s planning application encountered a delay this summer when Richmond council determined that an environmental statement was required due to fears over transport links. A report reads: “Given the uncertainty regarding the ability of the rail industry to cater for the predicted increase in passengers, there [are] significant concerns about the additional demand placed on the transport and highway network by event-goers and whether this demand can be satisfactorily managed. This is likely to result in a significant nuisance for Twickenham residents.” The planning application process is expected to continue into next year. England will host four Tests next month in the autumn international series with Australia, Fiji, New Zealand and Argentina visiting Twickenham.",https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/oct/12/rfu-could-use-anti-pee-paint-to-placate-twickenham-locals-in-push-for-new-licence,Sport,BBC,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c773810b86f7c392b74d953720be279edacf1923/558_234_4106_3284/master/4106.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=b723e6cb2e60dfd1b277a8ed7d0e0fcd",2025-10-12T07:00:45+00:00,6a14e29961f99a701b428b7ea610fbee4ee5a668
995c40378aab,Uefa plans to relax multiclub ownership declaration rules after Crystal Palace furore,,"Uefa is planning to give clubs more time to resolve potential multiclub ownership (MCO) issues next season following the controversy that led to Crystal Palace being expelled last summer from the Europa League. In a proposed change to its regulations discussed with elite clubs at a meeting last week of the newly named European Football Clubs in Rome, Uefa is poised to relax the 1 March deadline, which Palace failed to meet last season in an oversight that led to the FA Cup winners losing their Europa League place to Nottingham Forest. Under the new rules any club in contention for European qualification the following season would still be required to highlight any potential MCO issues to Uefa by 1 March, but would then be given additional time at the end of the season to resolve any problems if multiple clubs in the same ownership group have qualified for the same competition. With the draws for the qualifying rounds of the Europa League and Conference League taking place in June, the final deadline for resolving any MCO clashes would be put back to the start of that month. A failure to flag any issues by March would still be deemed a breach of the rules. The standard mechanism for avoiding an MCO breach is to set up a blind trust to manage one club, as Manchester City and Manchester United have done in the past with Girona and Nice, but Palace and Lyon failed to make such provisions last season. Uefa’s initiative is a response to a tumultuous summer dominated by MCO disputes particularly the Palace saga, during which Forest gave evidence against their Premier League rivals at the disciplinary hearing and in their subsequent appeal to the court of arbitration for sport in Lausanne. Elsewhere, the League of Ireland side Drogheda and Dunajska Streda, from Slovakia, were expelled from European competition altogether after qualifying for the Conference League, alongside clubs from the same ownership group. Palace were demoted to the Conference League after Uefa’s club financial control body ruled that they had failed to meet the March deadline for putting the club in a blind trust, which was deemed necessary as the then-shareholder John Textor’s French club Lyon also qualified for the Europa League. In a decision upheld subsequently by Cas, the CFCB ruled Textor’s joint shareholding at Palace and Lyon at the time of the deadline gave him a decisive influence at both clubs, despite the fact that he subsequently sold his 44.9% stake at Selhurst Park to Woody Johnson before this season’s competition started. Lyon were awarded the Europa League place, as Uefa’s qualifying criteria state that league position trumps a domestic cup win, a decision that could end up costing Palace more than £20m. skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Football Daily Kick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of football Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

fad5eebcbe90,Liverpool still without a WSL point after Fujino strike gives Manchester City late win,,"Gareth Taylor said his Liverpool team just need more time together to implement his style, after they lost a fifth game out of five to remain without a point in the Women’s Super League this season. Their latest defeat was inflicted by Taylor’s former side Manchester City, who – for the second season running – came from a goal down to win 2-1 at Anfield. Liverpool have a game in hand on the teams around them but sit joint-bottom of the table. “I’m disappointed for the group because they worked tremendously hard today and deserved more,” said Taylor, who was appointed in August. “At this moment we’re not getting what we deserve, and it’s tough but it’s fine; I think it’s close to working, it’s close to coming. It takes time. There has been a lot of change but we [will] keep working in the same way. “The results are tough at the moment because we’ve probably felt a little bit hard done by in a couple of games especially. But no one has consistently opened us up. “We have changed a lot of things. We have been asked to come in and play a new way. Sometimes it takes time, and certainly with how late we came into the door [late in pre‑season], it’s been really tough. More time with the girls would be what every head coach wants, more time to implement your way and your style.” City created all of the first-half opportunities but were fairly wasteful in the final third. Kerstin Casparij did hit the target when the ball rolled to her after Khadija Shaw was tackled in the box, but her left-footed shot went straight at Rafaela Borggräfe – who produced a one-handed save to keep out an Aoba Fujino strike, after the winger had raced on to Vivianne Miedema’s slick pass into the penalty area. In contrast to their lack of adventure into the City area during almost the entire first half, Liverpool were more attack-minded at the start of the second and they went in front with an excellent team goal as Ceri Holland’s right-wing cross found the back-post run of Cornelia Kapocs, who headed home in front of the Kop. Kapocs has scored both of Liverpool’s league goals this season. Liverpool’s Cornelia Kapocs (centre) celebrates scoring against Manchester City. Photograph: George Wood/Getty Images The hosts gifted the equaliser in unnecessary fashion through a mistake from Borggräfe; Shaw’s header was bouncing comfortably wide of goal but the keeper still tried to save it, only diverting the ball into the path of Iman Beney, who gratefully tucked in the leveller. Shaw did have a 79th-minute effort well saved, after shooting powerfully from the edge of the penalty area, as the City pressure began to intensify. It felt as though the winning goal was coming for the visitors, though, and it eventually did through Fujino. She was fed into space in the box and lashed in a clinical, low finish that had too much pace for Borggräfe. skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Moving the Goalposts No topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s football Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Andrée Jeglertz, City’s head coach, said: “We dominated the first half and created a couple of scoring chances but I missed a little bit of this desperation around the penalty area, [players saying] ‘I’m going to be one that is going into the box, I’m the one that really wants to score’, I missed that a little in the first half. Not until Liverpool scored. It was almost as if then we woke up and thought we need a little bit more, and that’s why we turned the game around.” There was a worry for Liverpool earlier in the game, when Marie Höbinger limped off with an injury. The midfielder appeared to be in tears of pain as she was substituted after treatment on the pitch. Jeglertz said: “Liverpool showed they are better than the position they have. They will definitely cause problems for other teams. They have good players and I think they showed in this game that they are very structured, organised and can make it difficult for us, so I am 100% sure they will soon climb the table.”",https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/oct/12/liverpool-manchester-city-womens-super-league-match-report,Sport,BBC,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/282b28c7241fc2670015ea9787df47fd5e99aeb9/320_0_3202_2561/master/3202.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=a3169830ede22442faa29412f43c10bb",2025-10-12T18:20:04+00:00,f7634b2a66388ac624dd19cfc8d9497819508343
d8b34137e625,Hull KR aim for more while triumph brings hope for all Super League teams,,"F or the first time in two decades Super League woke up on Sunday morning with a name other than Wigan Warriors , St Helens or Leeds Rhinos as its champions. Hull KR are the first new winners of the competition since 2004, and only the fifth in history to be crowned at all. For the Robins this is a watershed moment. Without a major trophy in 40 years before this season, they have now completed a historic treble in 2025 and are arguably Super League’s premier club side. For the wider competition as a whole, though, their success could not have come at a better time. Sport thrives on unpredictability so the fact that three teams have dominated the past 20 years of Super League has left many feeling the need for a new force to rise. With the competition expanding to 14 teams in 2026 – the new-look lineup will be announced in the coming days – there is a need for fresh stories and fresh clubs to dominate the airwaves. Rovers have not only ended a closed shop this year, they have hammered down its doors with a Robin-shaped battering ram. That feels fitting after a season that has delivered the promise of several new clubs coming to the fore and looking as if they can now emulate the new champions and themselves smash Super League’s glass ceiling. Castleford, Catalans Dragons, Hull FC, Warrington and Salford have reached at least one grand final, fallen short and then fallen back into the mire: all five finished in the bottom half this season. But with Hull KR now on top, there is a clear belief that a new, expanded Super League can yield more new champions. There has been that long-craved unpredictability and feeling of freshness throughout this year that, aside from the obvious story of Hull KR’s rise to greatness, is an immense positive for Super League going into 2026. Leigh Leopards’ third-placed finish shows they are not too far behind the Robins, while Leeds rose from eighth last year to fourth this season. Wakefield Trinity were playing in the Championship in 2024 but they made the Super League playoffs after promotion, underlining that clubs – including Toulouse and York, who are vying for promotion this time around – do not simply have to be content with scrambling to avoid finishing bottom of Super League. Hull KR’s Jez Litten celebrates scoring his team’s third try against Wigan. Photograph: Alex Livesey/Getty Images But good luck wrestling the title away from a Hull KR side in no mood to be regarded as a flash in the pan. “We’ve got a saying at the club that your rent is due every day,” their captain, Elliot Minchella, said. “No matter what you’ve achieved up to that point, you’ve still got to pay your rent and work hard. “Regardless of what you’ve done, you don’t sit back and take your foot off the gas. If anything, you’ve got to work even harder because you’re there to be chased. We’ll be chased next year but I’m looking forward to it.” The majority of this squad is contracted long term and their biggest problem is how long they can keep their coach, Willie Peters, from the lure of the National Rugby League. Peters’s stock has risen further with this triumph but his immediate focus in 2026 will be a World Club Challenge against Brisbane Broncos. That has been pencilled in for 20 February but the venue is yet to be determined. It will be in England, with Rovers’ Craven Park home and the MKM Stadium, home of Hull FC, options at this stage. skip past newsletter promotion after newsletter promotion Irrespective of that game, Rovers are now a bona fide force in British rugby league. They finished bottom of Super League as recently as 2020 but players such as Minchella and the final’s undoubted star, Mikey Lewis, have heralded a new era not only for Hull KR but for Super League as a whole. Suddenly, anyone has the right to believe it could be their year in 2026. The action is not over this year, though; in fact, it is just beginning. Several players from the Super League champions look likely to be included in Shaun Wane’s 24-man England squad for this autumn’s Ashes. The squad will be revealed on Monday lunchtime, with the first Test at Wembley on 25 October. Lewis is certain to be selected and based on what he has done this year – especially in the grand final – it would be a major surprise were he not in the side for the first match of the series. Should England manage to win the Ashes for the first time since 1970, it could catapult league to new heights in this country after Rovers’ domestic success.",https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/oct/12/hull-kr-aim-for-more-while-triumph-brings-hope-for-all-super-league-teams,Sport,BBC,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c806409b4acd2bf0a2ac50e02ab109146d8f87ff/518_0_4545_3636/master/4545.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=673eee4921a6dbfe3095070c1a357f28",2025-10-12T14:02:34+00:00,67305345ce56ee934bcabac893f36df7247c0b1f
940ea4247722,World No 204 Vacherot defeats cousin Rinderknech to seal fairytale Shanghai win,,"Valentin Vacherot closed out one of the most stunning big tournament runs in the history of professional tennis, becoming the lowest‑ranked player to win a Masters 1000 title as he roared back from a set down to defeat his cousin, Arthur Rinderknech, 4-6, 6-3, 6-3 and triumph at the Shanghai Masters. There is little precedent for so many of Vacherot’s achievements over the past two weeks. At No 204, the 26-year-old had only narrowly entered the qualifying draw, where he was the second-lowest ranked direct entrant, following a number of late injury withdrawals. He is the third qualifier to win a Masters 1000 title in the 35-year history of the format and the first Monégasque player to win any ATP title. “It’s unreal what just happened,” Vacherot said. “I have no idea what is happening. It’s just crazy. I’m just so happy about my performance these past few weeks. I just want to thank everyone who put a brick into my career since the beginning. Sharing this [with Arthur] was really tough, there has to be one loser. But I think there are two winners today, one family that won and I think for the sport of tennis, this story is unreal.” Vacherot’s performances, with wins against Novak Djokovic and Holger Rune, have been astounding enough but his opponent has made this so much more special. Rinderknech and Vacherot, whose mothers are sisters, grew up together. It was the 30-year-old Rinderknech, ranked No 54, who convinced Vacherot to compete in the Texas A&M Aggies US college team before turning professional. They have played doubles together on numerous occasions and throughout this tournament they clearly inspired each other to keep on advancing. On Sunday morning, they warmed up together on Shanghai’s stadium court. Arthur Rinderknech (left) and his cousin Valentin Vacherot after the Shanghai Masters final. Photograph: Lintao Zhang/Getty Images By far the biggest challenge of the tournament for both players was putting their relationship to the side for the day in the biggest occasion of their careers. They had faced each other only once before, with Rinderknech winning in a lowly ITF event in 2018, a result that earned him roughly $400. Here, Vacherot earned $1,124,380 (£823,000), more than double his career earnings. For a while, as Rinderknech eased through the opening set, it appeared that the more accomplished and experienced player might run away with the match. However, Vacherot gradually worked his way in, finding his feet by building rhythm behind his enormous first serve. When he finally generated a break point, he took it, snatching the decisive break in set two with a searing backhand down-the-line winner and roaring in delight. By 2-0 in the final set, Vacherot had won five consecutive games and was in full flow. As he desperately dragged himself to the biggest opportunity of his life, Vacherot conceded just three points on his serve in the final set and he closed out his ninth win in two magical weeks with some of his very best tennis. After Vacherot fired a forehand passing shot down the line to seal the win, he shared an emotional hug with Rinderknech at the net. He then scaled his player box and as he hugged Benjamin Balleret, his coach and brother, tears began to fall. Throughout this week the two cousins have used the customary post-match camera lens signing to encourage each other. This time, Vacherot had only one thought on his mind. “Grandpa and grandma would be proud,” he wrote. Valentin Vacherot recovered from a set down to win – as he had done three times earlier in the tournament main draw. Photograph: Jade Gao/AFP/Getty Images The two men sat together as they waited for the trophy ceremony, Rinderknech putting an arm around his cousin, and they both broke down in tears on multiple occasions as they attempted to address and congratulate each other in their speeches. The effort it took for them to break new ground reach this point in their careers was illustrated by Rinderknech rolling off the podium while writhing in pain due to cramps in the middle of Vacherot’s speech. “Two cousins are stronger than one,” Rinderknech said in French. “You won today, congratulations. I gave it my all. I’m so happy for you, I hope there will be more. I love you so much.” Meanwhile, Coco Gauff closed out an excellent week at the Wuhan Open by winning her 12th career title with a 6-4, 7-5 win against the sixth seed Jessica Pegula. Gauff, the WTA No 3, has endured a difficult few months since winning her second grand slam title at the French Open in June, struggling particularly with her second serve.

13b611822893,Winter is coming: England’s cricketers fly out for long tour that will decide Ashes and World Cup,,"A meteorologist would say that England’s winter will start this year at midnight on 1 December; an astronomer would point a few weeks later to the 21st, perhaps even the moment at precisely 3.03pm when the northern hemisphere is tilted furthest away from the sun, the least sun-kissed moment of its least sunny day. But a cricket fan might go a little earlier, perhaps as soon as next Saturday at about 7.15am. Leaves might still be clinging to trees as yet unbothered by frost, but that is when the national side is scheduled to play its first fixture of a hectic touring schedule, and by the time it all ends the Ashes will have been decided, a World Cup will have been won, and it will be spring. For the players involved in all formats, these moments will bring a combination of excitement and perhaps also a bit of dread. The T20 squad departed for New Zealand on Friday, with the four men among them who have also been selected for the Ashes – Harry Brook, Jacob Bethell, Brydon Carse and Zak Crawley – knowing that only injury will bring them home within the next three months (and even then for no more than 10 days, before they depart again this time for Sri Lanka and from there a T20 World Cup in India). Four more members of the Ashes squad will follow along with the other ODI players not already there 10 days later, accompanied by a few Test bowlers, Mark Wood, Josh Tongue and Gus Atkinson among them, who are not due to play any white-ball cricket but want to work on their fitness. A full month before the Ashes starts in Perth most of England’s squad will be in New Zealand. There is only one official warmup game in Australia, against the Lions at Lilac Hill in the Perth suburbs, but by then few of the players should have any rust to work off. It is a formidable commitment, but not a novel one. Back in 1986 the players left one day earlier, on 9 October, and did not get home until 16 February. In the Guardian Matthew Engel raged that “the itinerary is an outrage … Lord’s have meekly agreed to a tour that treats the players as little more than air freight.” Graham Gooch, their best opener, took one look at the schedule and made his excuses. “My wife and I have just had twins, and my family commitments mean I can’t go away for four and a half months,” he said. “I studied the itinerary to see if I could get them out there but … I couldn’t make it work.” Graham Gooch, pictured here during the 1987 Cricket World Cup semi-final, opted to not go on tour the previous year due to the intense schedule. Photograph: Adrian Murrell/Allsport/Getty Images By the time the tour ended, Mike Gatting, England’s captain, was pleading with the authorities to learn and change. “We knew at the beginning it was going to be hard,” he said at the time. “We had an itinerary to fulfil and we’ve done it as best we can, but now the lads are tired.” When they landed at Heathrow, Gatting warned “too much cricket will kill a few players before they are ready to be killed”. Four decades later not a lot has changed, and if the state matches that used to pad out tours of Australia have been abandoned plenty T20s have sprung up to replace them. “That was a long, long trip,” Gatting says now. If today’s players don’t have it much easier, Gatting says those closest to them do. “It was the wives, looking after kids on their own, who struggled,” he says. “The families are looked after so much better than when we played. If they came out we had to pay for them, pay for their flights and their hotels, and quite rightly that’s all changed. Before it was horrible. There’s so much of a better atmosphere now. And there are probably only four or five players who will be involved in all of England’s games this winter, when we used to play all the competitions.” England played 30 games on that trip, including state and ceremonial matches, and Gatting appeared in all but four of them. Of the 19 full internationals across two formats and three competitions – the Ashes, the Perth Challenge (a four-team ODI tournament arranged to mark the America’s Cup and the completion of some new floodlights at the Waca) and the World Series Cup (another ODI tournament involving three of those same four teams), Gatting was one of six players who appeared in every one and eight who were picked at least 17 times. Miraculously, and against most expectations, England won the lot. “Playing for your country is what you aim for, always,” Gatting says. “It’s something you want to do. And in this day and age it’s made slightly easier because of the way families are treated and that’s so important. We struggled to make phone calls, we had to write letters home. It’s a hard trip, but going to Australia for the Ashes, it’s fantastic. As an England player it’s the one series you want to be involved in.” There are no repeats now of the experience of Worcestershire’s Don Kenyon, who returned from England’s tour of India in 1952 to meet for the first time a daughter who was already four months old. And compared with some past tours this is but a blink: when England boarded a train for Tilbury at London’s St Pancras on the morning of 18 September 1920 it started an unbroken period of 462 days – a little over one year and three months – in which either they or the Australians, who played in England the following summer, were on an Ashes tour. The English players were away for seven months and five days, Australia’s – having popped in to South Africa for three Tests on the way home – for nine months and two days. Compared with some of their forebears, it is not just with white balls and limited overs that Friday’s travellers are dealing in short formats.",https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/oct/11/england-ashes-world-cup-schedule-cricket,Sport,BBC,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/428c6773ca307091b611f7ff5ca1b5efeab2edeb/153_81_2763_2211/master/2763.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=0ec52e669f18a712ba0646f6fd02e1a7",2025-10-11T07:00:18+00:00,1c5aa494c34504a130ddd8c58607269b7c147abe

The Robins, meanwhile, stand on the verge of their own history-making treble having won the League Leaders’ Shield and the Challenge Cup. Victory for Wigan – contesting their 14th Grand Final, winning seven of them – would see the Warriors join Leeds and St Helens as the only clubs to win three consecutive Grand Finals.

Steve Clarke’s side should have been three or four goals down against the slick visitors before Konstantinos Tsimikas eventually fired Greece in front in the 62nd minute. However, goals from Ryan Christie, Lewis Ferguson and substitute Lyndon Dykes turned the 2026 World Cup qualifier around and took Scotland on to seven points from three Group C fixtures, behind the leaders Denmark on goal difference.

a43e1ce11e5c,Tiger Woods comeback in doubt after seventh back surgery for collapsed disc,,"Tiger Woods has announced that he underwent back surgery on Friday to address a collapsed disc in his spine. The 15-time major winner had lumbar disk replacement surgery after he experienced pain in his lower back and said on social media that the operation was deemed successful, although it is unknown when the 49-year-old will return to golf. It is the second time the former world No 1 has undergone back surgery in just over a year, having had an operation on his lumbar spine in September 2024 to relieve a nerve impingement of his lower back. A statement on Woods’ X account said : “After experiencing pain and lack of mobility in my back, I consulted with Doctors and Surgeons to have tests taken. “The scans determined that I had a collapsed disc in L4/5, disc fragments and a compromised spinal canal. I opted to have my disc replaced yesterday, and I already know I made a good decision for my health and my back. “On Friday, Tiger underwent lumbar disc replacement surgery in his L4/5 Lumbar spine for lower back symptoms. “The surgery was deemed successful and performed by Dr Sheeraz Qureshi and his team at the Hospital for Special Surgery in New York.” It adds to a growing list of injuries that Woods has had to deal with after he ruptured his left achilles while training and practicing at home in March this year. Woods has not featured since the Open Championship at Royal Troon in 2024 and planned to make a comeback for the Genesis Invitational earlier this year but pulled out due to the death of his mother the week before.

2b7ac2089071,Penn State fire James Franklin after disastrous collapse – and with coach owed nearly $50m,,"James Franklin is out at Penn State. The school fired their longtime head coach on Sunday, less than 24 hours after a 22-21 home loss to Northwestern all but ended whatever remote chance the preseason No 2 team had of reaching the College Football Playoff. Terry Smith will serve as the interim head coach for the rest of the season for the Nittany Lions (3-3, 0-3 Big Ten), who began the year with hopes of winning the national title only to have those hopes evaporate by early October amid a string of losses, each one more stinging than the last. Penn State, who reached the CFP semifinals 10 months ago, fell at home to Oregon in overtime in late September. A road loss at previously winless UCLA followed. The final straw came on Saturday at Beaver Stadium, where the Nittany Lions let Northwestern escape with a victory and lost quarterback Drew Allar to injury for the rest of the season. Franklin went 104-45 during his 11-plus seasons at Penn State. Yet the Nittany Lions often stumbled against top-tier opponents, going 4-21 against teams ranked in the top 10 during his tenure. There was hope this fall might be the one when Penn State would finally break through. Yet after three easy wins during a light non-conference schedule, the Nittany Lions crumbled. Athletic director Pat Kraft said the school owes Franklin – who is due nearly $50m in a buyout of his contract, which went through to 2031 – an “enormous amount of gratitude” for leading the Nittany Lions back to relevance but felt it was time to make a change. “We hold our athletics programs to the highest of standards, and we believe this is the right moment for new leadership at the helm of our football program to advance us toward Big Ten and national championships,” Kraft said. The move will cost Penn State at a time the athletic department has committed to a $700m renovation to Beaver Stadium. The project is expected to be completed by 2027. Former athletic director Sandy Barbour signed Franklin to a 10-year contract extension worth up to $85m in 2021. According to terms of the deal, Penn State will have to pay Franklin’s base salary of $500,000, supplemental pay of $6.5m and insurance loan of $1m until 2031. It’s a steep price, but one the university appears willing to pay to find a coach who can complete the climb to a national title. “We have the best college football fans in America, a rich tradition of excellence, significant investments in our program, compete in the best conference in college sports and have a state-of-the-art renovated stadium on the horizon,” Kraft said. “I am confident in our future and in our ability to attract elite candidates to lead our program.”",https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/oct/12/penn-state-fire-james-franklin-after-disastrous-collapse-and-with-coach-owed-nearly-50m,Sport,BBC,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e46f694385e8c5156d8546cc147fc0a3aef57e8f/320_255_3331_2665/master/3331.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=ec9cf29810310e84c76e4efbff30f976",2025-10-12T18:38:30+00:00,78794376404cde56f7697b858917c478f5ad90ef
499f84721fe5,Gewan denies Aidan O’Brien record with shock 25-1 Dewhurst Stakes triumph,,"The punters cheering as the winner crossed the line in the Group One Dewhurst Stakes were the ones who had remembered the old gambling maxim that you should always forgive a good horse one bad run. Gewan, the 25-1 winner of the season’s most prestigious two-year-old race, had looked every inch a Classic prospect in his first two starts before finishing a lacklustre fourth as the 6-5 favourite for the Champagne Stakes at Doncaster last month. He returned to his earlier form in no uncertain terms under a confident ride by James Doyle, who was soon settled close to the early lead before grabbing a decisive advantage with a move to the front a furlong-and-a-half out. Gewan, who runs in the green colours of the Chinese billionaire Zhang Yuesheng, crossed the line three-quarters of a length in front of the 7-4 favourite, Gstaad, foiling Aidan O’Brien’s tilt at a record ninth Dewhurst success. That Gstaad’s main market rival, Distant Storm, was another length-and-a-half away in third, with Zavateri, a Group One winner this season, fourth also gives a solid feel to the form. Gewan’s path through his juvenile season has also been a carbon-copy of that taken by Chaldean, the 2,000 Guineas winner in 2023 , in his two-year-old campaign three years ago. Andrew Balding’s colt is now top-priced at 12-1 to give the trainer a third win in the colts’ Classic since 2020. “We were saying coming into the race that he was overpriced,” Balding said. “His York performance [in the Acomb Stakes] was really good and you’ve got to forgive him Doncaster. So we weren’t without hope, but he’s still got to come and do it, he was given a brilliant ride and he’s a very good horse.” Gewan’s owner bought into the colt after his impressive win in the Acomb, and took the subsequent failure at Town Moor in his stride. James Doyle lifts the Dewhurst Stakes trophy after winning the race on Gewan. Photograph: Bradley Collyer/PA “They’re very straightforward and they took the defeat at Doncaster without flinching, having just bought the horse,” Balding said. “That enabled us to just kick on and stick with the plan we wanted, and that’s the reason he’s here. “The soft ground didn’t help at Doncaster, but I don’t think it was just that. For whatever reason, he wasn’t at his best, but he was today. It’s a relief, but his work at home suggested he would play a part today.” As a son of Night Of Thunder, the 2014 2,000 Guineas winner , Gewan is far from guaranteed to get the Derby trip, but a mile-and-a-half at Epsom promises to be ideal for Pierre Bonnard, the winner of the 10-furlong Zetland Stakes.

ab24b5524aae,Jaron Ennis dazzles in 154lb debut with one-round destruction of Uisma Lima,,"Jaron Ennis needed less than two minutes to remind boxing why he’s long been considered the sport’s next big thing. The 28-year-old Philadelphian nicknamed Boots flattened Uisma Lima on Saturday night at the Xfinity Mobile Arena, marking an explosive debut at 154lb and setting the stage for the far bigger challenges that await him next year. Ennis dropped the sturdy but unheralded Lima three times in 118 seconds, igniting the rollicking hometown crowd squarely in his corner. A concussive right uppercut started the unraveling, followed by two blistering flurries that left his Portugal-based Angolan opponent unable to continue. Referee Shawn Clark waved it off at 1:58 of the opening round, giving the unbeaten Ennis his 35th professional win, his 31st inside the distance, and the kind of statement that reverberates through the sport even in a mismatch. “The more I move up, the stronger I get,” Ennis said afterward. “This is my division now. I sent a big message tonight.” That message was aimed squarely at Vergil Ortiz Jr. The undefeated Texan, who holds the WBC’s interim junior middleweight title, is expected to meet Ennis in early 2026 in what promoter Eddie Hearn called “one of the best fights to be made in American boxing”. The Matchroom Boxing supremo confirmed that an agreement with Golden Boy Promotions is already in place, pending Ortiz’s November title defense against Erickson Lubin. Saturday’s quick destruction doubled as vindication for Ennis, the former unified welterweight champion who’d spent years draining himself to make 147lb. His father and trainer, Derek “Bozy” Ennis, had long said the welterweight cut cost him strength and sharpness. “He was killing himself to make 147,” Hearn said. “Now we’re seeing the real Boots: closer to 100%. He’s massive, powerful and finally free.” Jaron Ennis, right, looks to land a punch on Uisma Lima during their fight on Saturday night. Photograph: Emma Brawley/Emma Brawley Matchroom Boxing Lima, a fringe contender and distant 10-1 underdog, barely had time to test him. After probing with a few jabs, Ennis switched to a southpaw stance and sneaked in a right uppercut that lifted Lima’s head like a hinge before landing three more hooks that dropped him flat on his back. After beating the count, Lima’s balance was gone and his eyes told the story. Ennis moved in coldly, swarming him with another hail of punches that dumped him to the canvas a second time. When Lima rose again, he staggered backward into a neutral corner, where Ennis closed the distance and let his hands go. The fusillade of punches left the referee with no choice but to intervene as the towel came flying from Lima’s corner. When it was over, Ennis looked almost sheepish at the ease of it. “I was trying to test him out,” he said. “But my pop told me, ‘Don’t play with him.’ So I just went in there and went for the kill.” Afterward, Hearn was effusive. “I’ve worked with some incredible fighters over the years,” he said, “and I think this guy is the best I’ve ever worked with. Some fighters can punch, some are defensive geniuses, some have great footwork. Boots has absolutely everything.” There is no shortage of opportunities for Ennis in a deep 154lb division, including newly minted beltholders Xander Zayas and Abass Baraou or the popular Sebastian Fundora, whose hand injury last week postponed his title defense against Keith Thurman. But none would move the needle quite like Ortiz. The two have circled each other for years, twin comets on parallel trajectories, their eventual collision long predicted and eagerly awaited. “It’s going to happen next,” Ennis said. “He’s got his fight coming up. If he don’t win, I’ll fight the winner of that. I want Vergil Ortiz next.”",https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/oct/12/jaron-ennis-knockout-uisma-lima-154lb-debut-vergil-ortiz,Sport,BBC,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/18c0238a4f87701810e88bbe383d5b8173e96049/367_0_3672_2938/master/3672.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=f72e62a153ca2eabac5f0e2a91480875",2025-10-12T06:05:55+00:00,7528e6e871eae720c49d15bfd444ade3640692c5
bc9ec981cc4a,World No 204 Vacherot topples Djokovic to set up cousin v cousin Shanghai final,,"The Shanghai Masters will witness one of the most astounding climaxes to any tournament as two cousins, Valentin Vacherot and Arthur Rinderknech, extended their shock breakthrough runs with monumental wins to face each other in the final. Vacherot continued his fairytale by toppling an injured Novak Djokovic 6-3, 6-4 to become the lowest-ranked Masters 1000 finalist. In his first match against a top-five opponent, the Monégasque world No 204 maintained his composure as Djokovic appeared to struggle with his left gluteal muscle from early in the first set. Vacherot’s tournament has been an incredible spectacle by itself, but it has been made even more remarkable by the events in the top half of the draw. His cousin Rinderknech, a more established name on the ATP tour at No 54, put together the best result of his career. The Frenchman edged past the former world No 1 Daniil Medvedev 4-6, 6-2, 6-4 in the second semi-final on Saturday. As Rinderknech closed out his victory, Vacherot walked on to the court holding his head in disbelief before embracing his cousin. “I can’t even say it’s a dream because I don’t think even one person in our family dreamed about it,” Rinderknech said. “We started believing it, I would say, in the quarters, maybe … Now we are here, we fought through so many matches and somehow we are the guys standing at the end. It’s just incredible.” Disbelief on the face of Valentin Vacherot after he beat Novak Djokovic 6-3, 6-4 in the semi-final. Photograph: Lintao Zhang/Getty Images The second-lowest direct entrant into the qualifying draw, Vacherot has put together one of the most surprising successes at a big tournament, winning eight matches over the past two weeks. That has included victories over the No 14 seed, Alexander Bublik, and Holger Rune, the 10th seed, alongside this giantkilling win over Djokovic, the fourth seed. “This is just crazy,” Vacherot said on court. “It was an hour and 40 minutes of pure joy, even though not many people wanted me to keep going. He’s really appreciated here. I got a bit lost in all his titles when they were announcing him, but it was an unreal experience.” While Vacherot’s career-high ranking sits at No 110, the second and third lowest-ranked Masters 1000 semi-finalists, No 191 Andrei Pavel and No 152 Borna Coric, were former top 20 players who had dropped down the rankings. Nothing like this has happened at a Masters 1000 event on the ATP tour. Arthur Rinderknech battled back from a set down to claim an upset 4-6, 6-2, 6-4 win over former US Open champion and 16th seed Daniil Medvedev. Photograph: Héctor Retamal/AFP/Getty Images The cousins, who played college tennis in the US for the Texas A&M Aggies, have been encouraging each other in China. After closing out the victory, Vacherot signed the a TV camera lens: “Aggies on top! Allez, Arthur!” Vacherot’s joy contrasted sharply with Djokovic’s misery as the 38-year-old continued to battle his own body. This had already been a challenging week for the Serb, who had suffered badly in the suffocating heat and humidity during the opening rounds, vomiting several times on court. It appeared he had recovered from those early difficulties, but it became clear early on that he was struggling. Djokovic took a medical time out at 3-4 in the first set and, despite the crowd urging him on, he was unable to move properly. skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Sport in Focus Sign up to Sport in Focus Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Novak Djokovic receives treatment during his semi-final loss to Valentin Vacherot. Photograph: Jade Gao/AFP/Getty Images Djokovic had been attempting to become the oldest Masters 1000 champion, he had already become the oldest quarter-finalist at this level. He has shown this year he is still the third-best in the world behind the untouchable duo of Carlos Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner. However, there is a reason why nobody at his age has achieved the milestones he continues to reach. The countless physical problems Djokovic has struggled with between his positive performances this year have further underlined the difficulty of continuing to compete at the highest level. In some ways, Djokovic may reflect even more bitterly on this result than some of his recent grand slam losses. While he has been outplayed by Alcaraz and Sinner in the past three major tournaments, things finally seemed to line up in his favour this week after Alcaraz withdrew because of the ankle injury he sustained during his Tokyo title run and then Sinner retired from his third-round match against Tallon Griekspoor due to the punishing conditions. Djokovic has recognised Alcaraz and Sinner are levels above him at the moment, but if he continues to put himself in good positions he could give himself a few more opportunities to achieve great things. This week represented one of those opportunities for the 24-time grand slam champion, who has not won a Masters 1000 event since 2023. Instead, his body failed him again.

728d30c4e862,Aston Villa must stop crying foul and focus on the Europa League instead,,"F our wins in a row and suddenly life does not seem so bad for Aston Villa. They are up into mid-table and if a 2-0 victory over Feyenoord in the Europa League will not quite live in the memory in the way last season’s games against Bayern Munich , Juventus and Paris Saint-Germain do, a return to Rotterdam at least evoked the glory days of 1982. It will be a while yet before the frustration at missing out on the Champions League fades, but there does now seem to be a gathering recognition that Villa have a decent chance of winning the Europa League, potentially adding Istanbul’s Besiktas Park to De Kuip as a venue where they have won a European trophy. The question, then, is where the gloom came from. Why did Villa seem so downbeat about a squad that, at least in terms of those on permanent contracts, had essentially traded Jacob Ramsey and Leon Bailey for the promising Evann Guessand? How did Villa manage to talk themselves into such a funk that they did not win any of their first six games of the season? The answer to which, just as it was for Newcastle, who also began the season in apparent denial about the quality of the squad, is profitability and sustainability rules (PSR). My Guardian colleague Barney Ronay has a theory that managers were essentially invented as a scapegoat , so that infuriated crowds could abuse the beleaguered figure on the touchline rather than a club’s board. The European Union used to perform a similar function for the UK government. It is useful for those in power to have something to blame, and in football that role is now performed by PSR. PSR is far from perfect. It has, surely without meaning to, created an environment in which clubs are incentivised to sell homegrown talent and to maintain a constant churn of transaction to generate, thanks to the marvels of amortisation, the book profit that gives them PSR headroom. But there are two things to be said in its defence. First, that clubs voted on it. It was not imposed from above. It is not some annoying and unavoidable quirk of nature. Clubs chose it and agreed to it. There are regular meetings at which they could propose an alternative. And some sort of check on spending is necessary, and this is the one we have got. Imagine it did not exist. Imagine if huge private equity companies or the sovereign wealth funds of Saudi Arabia or the United Arab Emirates could spend what they wanted. Football is financially stratified enough as it is, but the potential distortion would be grotesque: the game would, purely and simply, be about who had the richest owner. Plus there would always be the threat of that owner withdrawing with potentially devastating consequences for the club – as happened on a much lower scale to Gretna in 2008 after their owner, Brooks Mileson, fell ill and seemingly lost interest. It is often forgotten that when financial fair play rules were introduced in 2011, whatever their impact since, their purpose was to protect clubs from the sort of over‑ambition that had pushed Leeds to the brink. In practice, that may be frustrating for rising clubs. PSR does favour those clubs with large fanbases who attract the most lucrative sponsorship deals and can have a noodle partner in every port. But equally Villa, having gone from the Championship to the Champions League in five years, cannot really claim to have been held back. And if your wages to turnover ratio is – as Villa’s was – 91%, you are overspending. But the reason Villa are not in the Champions League this season is not PSR; it is that their goalkeeper got an entirely needless red card at Old Trafford in the final game of last season and so they lost a game in which a draw would have secured them a fifth-placed finish. Aston Villa’s Emiliano Martínez is shown a red card by the referee Thomas Bramall against Manchester United in the final game of last season, which they went on to lose 2-0. Photograph: Craig Brough/Action Images/Reuters There will be those who moan about the goal ruled out by a referee who incorrectly blew for a foul and did not let play run so the video assistant referee could not make him review the decision, but glitches are part of the game. Had the goalline cameras not been blocked off by players’ bodies in 2020, Sheffield United would have taken the lead against Villa in a game that finished 0-0 ; defeat there would have relegated them. skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Football Daily Kick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of football Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Last month saw the resignation of their sporting director Monchi – who, like gazpacho, never seems quite as effective outside Seville. Of 10 permanent signings made last season, only Amadou Onana started more than 10 league games. In January Villa gambled on the loan signings of Marcus Rashford and Marco Asensio to get into the Champions League. That was probably a justifiable move and nearly worked, but the nature of a gamble is that there are consequences if it goes wrong. Had they not been signed, another January arrival, Donyell Malen, might have had more opportunity to prove himself; his two goals against Burnley last weekend suggested he could yet have a significant role. Harvey Elliott and Jadon Sancho may not be quite at the level of Rashford and Asensio but both are intriguing loan options with points to prove. Elliott has shown evidence of great talent but appears not to be a fit for Arne Slot at Liverpool and, at 22, needs regular football. Sancho has lost his way since leaving Borussia Dortmund for Manchester United in 2021, but the basic ability is there if Unai Emery can resurrect it. Of 10 permanent signings Aston Villa made last season, only Amadou Onana started more than 10 league games. Photograph: Peter Cziborra/Action Images/Reuters If the clouds of largely self‑induced despondency have cleared, if they accept there is no grand conspiracy against them and that PSR is not the monster it has been painted as, what can Villa realistically hope for? Three of their players, more than any other club, started England’s 3-0 victory against Wales on Thursday. Aston Villa remain a very good side. They are unlikely to be in a title race but is there any reason they could not challenge Newcastle or Tottenham for fifth?

70f522997155,It can get worse: Blackpool’s latest defeat recalls Mick McCarthy meme,,"The Mick McCarthy “it can” meme is known far and wide as social media shorthand for woeful underperformance, although the full context is not. When McCarthy was infamously asked if a miserable run of one win in 17 games could continue and issued the deadpan response “it can” , he was the Blackpool manager struggling through his ill-fated 2023 spell. While Blackpool’s current predicament is not quite so desperate yet, a 1-0 defeat at Stockport on Saturday made it two wins from 12 League One games this season to leave the Seasiders second bottom. Fears the situation could deteriorate further after the failure and sacking of another veteran manager in Steve Bruce this week are alarmingly real, with injuries hitting hard and any pre-season optimism long gone. After an encouraging summer during which the owner, Simon Sadler, invested heavily and the club were lauded for their signings that included the experienced George Honeyman and Michael Ihiekwe from Championship clubs, few Blackpool fans expected to be languishing in the relegation zone. A playoff place was viewed as the bare minimum after last season’s ninth-place finish under Bruce, but the team are 23rd and already four points from safety. The Blackpool interim manager, Stephen Dobbie, on the touchline at Stockport. Photograph: Cody Froggatt/PA Stephen Dobbie is the club hero tasked, for now, with piecing it back together. The Scot has stepped up as interim manager having been part of Bruce’s backroom team and heard his name heartily sung by a sellout away contingent at Edgeley Park. Dobbie’s remit, after talks this week with Sadler, is to take charge of the team “until further notice”. But at Stockport he was unable to inspire a change in fortunes, despite seeing some positives. “The fans were unbelievable, sadly we just couldn’t get that goal for them,” he said. “Just a little bit more composure, technique and timing of the runs into the box instead of rushing the crosses, that’s now the aim. I can’t fault the players’ character.” With Blackpool’s shape and strategy at Stockport similar to the Bruce era, it was clear Dobbie’s priority was to restore confidence rather than to enact any major tactical tweaks. He may get another couple of games in charge, but many fans expect an established League One appointment, such as Richie Wellens or Ian Evatt, both former Blackpool players. “There is lots of goodwill for Dobbie,” said Blackpool supporter Tom Mayne, who runs the It’s Not Orange podcast. “It’s not his fault we’re in this position, he’s a great man and he’s been a massive part of our recent history. Some fans want a name like Wellens, but I really wouldn’t mind Dobbie getting the job long term. We need someone who’s going to be ruthless and command respect.” The first half at Stockport had an ominously familiar feel for Blackpool fans, with their team on the back foot throughout. Goalkeeper Franco Ravizzoli was equal to Kyle Wootton’s fourth-minute header and produced another good stop to palm away Ollie Norwood’s fizzing free-kick. The visitors had to twice scramble clear amid more Stockport dominance around the half-hour mark and a rare effort on goal, scuffed tamely by Dale Taylor, prompted gallows humour from the travelling faithful. “We’ve had a shot,” came their ironic chant. Stockport’s Joseph Olowu celebrates scoring the winner over Blackpool. Photograph: Cody Froggatt/PA Dobbie’s half-time words did jolt an improvement of sorts from Blackpool early in the second half. But with the game stretching and Stockport pushing harder for their goal, the hosts deservedly went ahead through Joseph Olowu from a set piece. It had taken a fine Ravizzoli fingertip save from Odin Bailey to keep it level but the resulting corner proved Blackpool’s undoing. “That’s been the story of our season,” said Dobbie. The interim manager did point to his team’s late rally as another note of positivity, yet it rarely looked like being enough against a savvy Stockport defence. skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Football Daily Kick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of football Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Much more will be required in the coming weeks to avoid a relegation battle this season. A vital home game against Wycombe, who are only four points ahead in 19th, awaits next week. “The players are hurting the same as everyone else,” Dobbie said. “It’s about trying to get the confidence back in them. I’ve got massive faith in the group. We’ve got injuries, so it’s a trying time for everyone. I’m confident in everyone’s ability to make a difference and I’ve got no doubt results will change. It’s a collective effort from the staff, not just the players.” Mayne, like most fans, would be dumbfounded to see Blackpool reduced to a fight for survival this season, but said: “If this form continues over the next five or six games and we don’t appoint a manager, it could become a really hard season.” The mission for Dobbie and whoever succeeds Bruce on a permanent basis is clear: rediscover the confidence and get a promotion-worthy squad finally punching its weight again. As Mayne said: “By playing players in their right positions and getting us to attack games, I think we can beat anyone in this league. So far it’s been pathetic to be honest. It hasn’t taken much to beat us.”",https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/oct/12/stockport-1-0-blackpool-relegation-fears-after-steve-bruce-sacking,Sport,BBC,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7ea3077e805d7b24ea12f60dd8f98e05912f207c/287_88_2522_2018/master/2522.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=401e8cb396e0529e11ef2fc54e22bf16",2025-10-12T07:00:47+00:00,f54b9966ea5fbb258035aee3392521ff66f38596
50f7d83ad8f1,A World Cup preying on Fomo: Fifa’s 2026 ticket scheme is a late-capitalist hellscape,,"W hen the first tickets for the 2026 World Cup went on sale last week, millions of fans joined online queues only to discover what Gianni Infantino’s assurance that “the world will be welcome” really means. The cheapest face-value seat for next summer’s final, somewhere in the gods of New Jersey’s 82,500-seat MetLife Stadium where the players are specks and the football’s a rumor, comes at a cost of $2,030 (oxygen tank not included). Most upper-deck seats range from $2,790 to $4,210, according to customers who finally glimpsed the prices that had been closely guarded. The much-touted $60 tickets for group-stage games, propped up by Fifa as evidence of affordability, exist only as comically tiny green smudges on the edge of digital seating maps, little more than mirages of inclusivity. Fifa had kept the costs under wraps until the very moment of sale, replacing the usual published table of price points with a digital lottery that decided who even got the chance to buy. Millions spent hours staring at a queue screen as algorithms determined their place in line. When access finally came for most, the lower-priced sections had already vanished, many presumably hoovered up by bots and bulk-buyers (and that’s before Fifa quietly raised the prices of at least nine matches after only one day of sales ). The whole process resembled less a ticket release than a psyop to calibrate how much frustration and scarcity the public will tolerate. This, Fifa insists, is merely an adaptation to “market norms” in the United States, where most matches will be staged, as though gouging fans were a cultural practice to be respected like banning beer at the Qatar World Cup . In a sense, they’re bang-on. Profiteering and exploitation have long served as America’s articles of faith in the absence of a national religion. In reality, what’s taking shape is less a global festival of soccer than a fintech laboratory for everything that has made contemporary entertainment so exhausting. The governing body has fused together every irritant of modern consumer life – dynamic pricing, algorithmic lotteries, endless logins, even the remnants of a failed crypto boom – into a single soul-deadening experience designed to turn access itself into a commodity. This is the World Cup re-engineered for the Ticketmaster-Live Nation monopoly era, where the thrill of fandom meets the calculus of hedge-fund speculation. The story began during the NFT craze of 2022, when Fifa launched Fifa+ Collect, promising fans “affordable ownership” of digital soccer moments – Pelé lifting the 1970 trophy, Maradona’s 1986 solo run, Kylian Mbappé’s goal in the 2018 final – each sold as a blockchain collectible. When the market collapsed (quelle surprise), Fifa reheated its own nachos by quietly rebadging the tokens as ticketing opportunities. The new scheme, marketed under the chillingly corporate Right to Buy (RTB) name, offers supporters the chance to purchase NFTs that would one day give them permission to purchase an actual match ticket. A Right to Final token costs up to $999 and can be redeemed only if the buyer’s chosen team reaches the final. If not, it becomes a useless JPEG. Fifa discovered how to monetize anticipation itself, a system that traffics not in tickets but in Fomo. That illusion was finally shattered this week, when Fifa Collect administrators disclosed that the vast majority of Right to Buy holders would only be eligible for Category 1 and 2 seats, the priciest brackets in Fifa’s opening phase at costs far beyond the reach of the average punter. The news triggered open revolt among the NFT community: Discord threads filled with complaints of being “ripped off” and a sudden rush to resell tokens as their market value collapsed. When the real tickets finally appeared, the scale of the escalation became clear. Category 1 seats for the semi-finals approach $3,000; quarter-finals nearly $1,700. Fifa’s new dynamic pricing model means those numbers can, and surely will, rise signficantly higher. The technique, borrowed from airlines and Silicon Valley ticket platforms, now governs the world’s biggest sporting event, creating a byzantine and hierarchical marketplace carved into endless tiers of privilege. World Cup seat plans World Cup seat plans At past World Cups, resale prices were capped at face value. For 2026, Fifa lifted that restriction and moved into the secondary market itself. Tickets on its official resale platform have already appeared for tens of thousands of dollars, including a $2,030 ticket for the final was relisted the next day for $25,000. Fifa double-dips by taking a 15% commission from the seller and another 15% from the buyer, pocketing $300 for every $1,000 traded. Officials claim this will discourage scalpers from using outside sites such as StubHub. In practice it legitimizes them, as though the easiest way to beat the touts was simply to host them. By the time a ticket is finally scanned at the turnstile on matchday, it may have been bought, flipped and resold three or four times, every trade skimming another cut into Fifa’s coffers. It’s less a ticketing system than a financial instrument, and suddently that $3.017bn target for ticket and hospitality revenue doesn’t seem so quixotic. Supporters’ groups have responded with predictable disbelief and outrage. Thomas Concannon of England’s Fans’ Embassy called the prices “astonishing”, pointing out that following a team through the tournament on the cheapest tickets would cost more than double the equivalent journey in Qatar. Add in transatlantic travel, accommodation and visa restrictions, and the so-called “most inclusive World Cup ever” begins to look an awful lot like a gated community. Ronan Evain of Fans Europe called it “the privatization of what was once a tournament open to all”, arguing that Fifa is building “a World Cup for middle-class Westerners and the happy few who can enter the US”. In Mexico, where resale laws have something resembling teeth, Fifa relented to government pressure and capped prices at face value on a localized ticket exchange platform. Everywhere else, the late-stage free-market grift carries on unchecked. The logic is simple: scarcity drives profit, and even disappointment can be monetized. Fifa’s defense leans heavily on American precedent. Concert promoters and major leagues have used dynamic pricing for years and resale sites routinely charge similar fees. But invoking “market norms” misses the point. Soccer’s global ritual isn’t meant to mimic the Super Bowl or the Eras Tour by normalizing the abusive consumer practices Americans resigned themselves to years ago. It was meant to belong to everyone: the traveling supporters, the families, the people who transform neutral stadiums into carnivals of color and noise. The 2026 rollout exposes a new frontier of sports capitalism: the monetization of emotion. Fifa has built an ecosystem in which every feeling – excitement, anxiety, devotion – becomes a revenue stream. Fear of missing out? There’s a token for that. Late-stage panic? Dynamic pricing will account for it. Regret? The resale platform will take another 30%. Buying a ticket is no longer an act of fandom but of speculation, a wager placed on both your team’s fortunes and one’s own disposable income. The parallels with the spiraling economics of the live music industry are striking . With concerts, the explosion of VIP “packages” and velvet-rope pricing has turned performance into a gated spectacle and audience into clientele. With soccer, the same transformation is under way. Stadiums once defined by chaos and community are being remade as climate-controlled malls of efficiency: perfect sightlines, perfect sound and prices that erase the very imperfection that made the experience human. When ordinary fans are priced out, what’s left is a sport stripped of its edge and flattened into entertainment. Fifa says that every dollar generated by ticket sales goes back into the game, as it stressed in a recent letter to the Guardian , like that shopworn talking point were a moral shield. Yet what’s being returned to the game is a recalibrated worldview: that soccer, like every other corner of modern life, can be measured, segmented and commodified. In the process, the world’s most democratic sport becomes an exercise in exclusion, where the right to belong is determined by AI and a balance sheet. Infantino keeps repeating that 2026 will be “the biggest, best and most inclusive World Cup ever”. On the first count he’ll surely be right and on the second he may be, but a World Cup priced as a luxury brand is destined to fall spectacularly short of the third. The dream football once offered of common ground and of shared joy has been bought, repackaged and sold back at a markup. When access itself becomes an asset class, the world’s game no longer belongs to the world.",https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/oct/11/fifa-2026-world-cup-tickets-dynamic-pricing-nft-resale,Sport,BBC,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/875af39c1fb8663de5554eb166c33f058254bb97/395_0_4596_3677/master/4596.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=da786a425e19996bb091054618fa13b0",2025-10-11T07:00:18+00:00,220bf05bdd9e2a6e118e9aba47c6f13289071765
755ea8bdf291,Clive Tyldesley: ‘I’ve only been drunk twice and once was with the England women’s team’,,"What is the best sporting accomplishment or achievement you have commentated on and did you ever harbour personal ambitions to be a professional in any sport? Tony Medlock I was never good enough at any sport to kid myself that I had a career at elite level. My parents would have told you that from an early age any sporting ambitions I entertained were in the area I ended up in; describing and commentating on top-level sport. I always resist any grading of goals or players or matches because I have a belief that sport belongs in its moment. Sport creates memories – we can recall vividly where we were, who we were with, what we were thinking, when our team won a trophy or an athlete won an Olympic gold medal … or Shane Lowry sunk a putt to seal the Ryder Cup . Those moments are very personal, and the job of the commentator is to try to add something to the memory of those moments. And those moments are unique and should remain separate from one another. My favourite line of commentary of yours is from the final whistle of the 1992 Second Division play off final between my beloved Blackburn Rovers and Leicester: “That’s it! Going up, going up, going up! Blackburn Rovers have made it at last, and the great Ewood gamble by Jack Walker on Kenny Dalglish has paid out the premier prize!” Did you have this or any of your other famous lines scripted, or is it all down to the moment? Dave Stainton Preparation for a commentary is partly about researching information; in the modern era that includes statistics and data. But more importantly, preparation is a journalistic process, asking yourself: “What’s the story here?” “What does it mean for Blackburn Rovers to win this match or for Leicester City to win this match?” In cup finals the commentator gets extra air time after the final whistle – during the celebrations, during the presentation of the trophy – to reflect on what they have seen, and in preparation for that I often draw up a sheet which will have, in this case, Blackburn down one side and Leicester down the other … you can’t script lines because you don’t know what the story of the game is going to be, but you can write bullet points which highlight the significance of victory or the repercussions of defeat for the two teams involved. That’s a useful reference point in those very emotional moments after a game such a playoff final. It’s then a case of finding the right words to fit the moment, and that can really only be done in the moment. After “And Solskj ær has won it!” did you think : “Shit, I hope Bayern don’t score now”? David Estherby That’s a very good question, actually, because in saying what I said I broke the cardinal rule of commentary, the Devon Loch rule: never wave the winner across the winning line until they’re there. And if Bayern [Munich] had gone down the other end and equalised and the game went to penalties, they would have definitely won the shootout, and then there probably would have been an effigy of me hanging on a lamp-post at the Arndale Centre by midnight. I would have been blamed for Manchester United not winning the final. When I recall that game there was a definite change in momentum when the equaliser went in; it was as if the Bayern players and fans had witnessed some sort of awful human tragedy. There was a disbelief that it was difficult for them to recover from. And therefore, when Ole [Gunnar Solskjær] reached out and diverted the ball into the roof of the net, the heart overruled the head and I said what I felt : “That’s it, that’s the winning goal.” Do you have any spare copies of the end-of-season compilation cassette you did for Radio City commemorating Liverpool’s double-winning side? My mum chucked mine out by accident (so she says). Stephen Carr Sounds like you lost it yourself! I do have a box of memorabilia but I’m pretty sure a copy of that cassette is not in it. Apologies Stephen, can’t help with that one, sadly. What is your favourite ground to commentate at and why? Adam There are certain stadiums that create an atmosphere of their own; you wouldn’t be surprised to hear me say Anfield or Celtic Park on a Champions League night. But for the commentator that’s no good if you can’t see the pitch properly. And so in terms of favourite places to broadcast from I tend to make my selection based on the height and access of the commentary position. Some of them are a long way away from the pitch, some of them are too close to the pitch … some of them are too low, some of them are too high. For many years the commentary position at Goodison Park involved walking past the roof of the Bullens Road Stand and then shinnying down a vertical ladder, none of which is preferable in preparation for a football match! At modern stadiums, like the Emirates and the Etihad, you are provided with a commentary position that is at a perfect height. Also, I was fortunate enough to commentate on a couple of Cup finals in the Cardiff era, when Wembley was being renovated, and I always felt the commentary position there [the Millennium Stadium] was what I would call a “no-excuses commentary position”. ‘And Solskjær has won it!’ Manchester United seal the 1999 Treble and provide Clive Tyldesley with the platform to well and truly shine. Photograph: Colorsport/Shutterstock Has there ever been a moment in a match you’ve been commentating on that has left you speechless? Daniel Richardson I always struggle with this question because in my job I’m always trying very hard not to be speechless. I’ve got professional standards and hate it if I make an error, and getting lost for words would very much be an error. My great mentor Reg Gutteridge used to say: “Silent moments are not lesser moments; instead they are times during a television commentary when you don’t need to add anything and instead ask yourself what could you add next.” So silences are part of good commentary. How do you feel about where the style of modern-day commentary is heading? Rob The trend in contemporary sports media is towards conversation. We’ve seen the rise of the podcast and before that the rise of the phone-in. Even the main rights holders for live sport embroider their coverage with long discussions and debates. It’s the way we’ve consumed sport in classroom and barroom arguments and in recent times those arguments have become content and created stars, people who are genuine influencers and influence the way people consume sport. So there was an inevitability of that trend spilling into commentary; it’s become more conversational, which has been reflected in recent years with the rise of more than two people commentating on live football and other sporting events. The first priority of a commentator is to consider your audience and who your audience are. The audience for, say, a World Cup semi-final on terrestrial television is different to that for a Conference League game on TNT Sport. You need to commentate to your audience, and the danger when you have more than two people working on a live commentary is that they start talking to each other rather than to the audience. And, as the audience, you feel as if you’re eavesdropping into a conversation. That doesn’t serve an audience because it doesn’t engage and include them. “Not for me, Clive .” How many times a day do you hear that phrase? Mike Cotton A lot! It’s a phrase Andy Townsend first used regularly and [Ally] McCoist has taken to a different level! In all seriousness … the relationship between a commentator and a co-commentator is traditionally, and essentially, a trained broadcaster who can recognise the players and the drama and someone who has gone across the white line and can provide an informed, professional opinion on what we’ve just seen. I always bow to the experience of a co-commentator, and so if I said something and Andy looked at me and said “Not for me, Clive”, I fully took it on board. And ultimately it was a really good friend in a really gentle and sympathetic way saying: “Shut up! What do you know?!” If I was having one of those dream supper parties that people are often asked to put together, Andy and Ally would definitely be there. Both are great pals and wonderful co-commentators to work with, on and off the mic. Clive Tyldesley on commentary duty alongside his longtime co-commentator and friend Andy Townsend. Photograph: Mike Egerton/PA Are there any teams you were fond of commentating on who did not win the Champions League during your time covering the tournament for ITV? Eddie Munro As a kid I was fond of Manchester United; I’m from Bury, my dad took me to Old Trafford when I was five and throughout my youth there was only one team in the world for me. But when I started to work that feeling became diluted by the fact I was commentating on my mates; my friends were out there, people I had met through football. It’s a different feeling when you’re commentating on people who you know. In regards to that period, from basically 1999 through the noughties, Premier League clubs were among the regular contenders to win the Champions League and I guess it would have been nice to see Arsenal get over the line. I had no affinity with the club but I always had a huge amount of respect for Arsène Wenger; he was never dismissive of any inquiries, he always tried to be helpful, and that team during that era, with the likes of [Thierry] Henry, [Robert] Pires, [Dennis] Bergkamp, were certainly good enough to win a Champions League final, and in Paris [in 2006] they very nearly did . Did you ever imagine in early 1972, when you opened the door to Room 7 at Kirkham Grammar School, where we were having an English lesson with Mick Clarkson, and announced “Preston are playing Man United” after listening to the FA Cup draw on your radio, that you would one day commentate on all those big matches for ITV and BBC? Philip Smith As previously touched on, I entertained ambitions of being a commentator from an early age; I wasn’t the only kid who chased a football around the park and commentated to himself, but I meant it. I wanted to do that. It was my one and only ambition. English was my favourite school subject; I was that kid who loved to write essays and poetry, and wrote the match reports for the school magazine. So English teachers were a big part of my school life and I can remember two or three who had a big influence on me. Mick Clarkson was certainly one of those. He died this year and I was fortunate to have some contact with him, after years and years and years with no contact, before he passed away. That was lovely.

Stop moaning, start cheering!’ Photograph: Alex Broadway/The FA/Getty Images How do you reflect on being an early supporter of England’s women’s team? I remember you being in Sweden for the 1995 World Cup, alongside Hazel Irvine (I was England’s ­press officer). Mark Sudbury I’ve only been truly drunk twice in my adult life and once was with the England women’s football team in Sweden in 1995. It was after they lost [to Germany] in the quarter-finals, I was staying in the same hotel as the team and thought I could drink the likes of Clare Taylor and Kaz [Karen] Walker under the table; I was wrong! Nobody who follows women’s football needs telling the game had a very different profile in 1995 than it does in 2025 and some of the pioneers of the success England have enjoyed in recent years were in that team. So I look back fondly at being there, especially as it’s the only women’s football I have ever covered. Are you still a big fan of Joni Mitchell? If I’m not mistaken, you once called her “the first lady of rock ”. Peter Walker ­I’ve got pretty eclectic musical tastes; I like a bit of everything and make a point of listening to contemporary music, and more than anything I’m in awe of anybody who can write words that take my breath away. Make me think. Make me cry. Joni Mitchell certainly had that ability, she was one of the truly great songwriters of my youth. More than anything I admired how she could – can – take men apart in two lines. She knows us much better than we know ourselves.

866dcf069f74,The peerless A’ja Wilson may already be the WNBA’s greatest ever player,,"A ’ja Wilson’s one-of-one season didn’t end merely with confetti so much as a deeper confirmation. When her Las Vegas Aces finished off a four-game sweep of the Phoenix Mercury on Friday night to become only the second team in WNBA history to win three titles in a four-year span, the final horn felt less like a climax than a verdict: the best team of the era led by the best player of the era. When the dust settled the 29-year-old from Columbia, South Carolina, had achieved a quadrafecta no player in the NBA or WNBA had ever managed: winning the scoring title, the Most Valuable Player award, Defensive Player of the Year honors and MVP of the finals in the same year. Thanks to Wilson, a team who’d looked like the next great American sports dynasty before slipping from their perch a year ago was back at the mountaintop. But anyone who watched the front half of the season knows this was the least expected of Aces’ three banners. For most of the year Las Vegas didn’t give the appearance of a playoff team let alone a champion. They staggered through injuries and misfires, dropped coin-flip games and wore the tightness of a group playing beneath its standard. If dynasties are supposed to hum, this one coughed and sputtered. Quick Guide WNBA finals 2025 Show To understand how we got here, flash back to 2 August, when the Aces were boat-raced by 53 points by the Minnesota Lynx on national television, the worst loss in franchise history and the ultimate stress test of the culture Becky Hammon has spent four seasons building. Las Vegas were a moribund 14–14 then, six weeks from the finish line and barely in the postseason frame. Wilson walked out of Michelob Ultra Arena replaying the wreckage, drafting and redrafting a message she knew had to cut through without burning down what morale remained. She workshopped it with her partner Bam Adebayo, the two-time Olympic gold medallist and Miami Heat captain and then hit send to the team chat: If you weren’t embarrassed from yesterday, don’t come into this gym. You’re not needed or wanted here. We need the mindset to shift, because that was embarrassing. The next day, Vegas routed Golden State and never lost again in the regular season, ripping off 16 straight wins to nail down the No 2 seed while Wilson sprinted past history to a record fourth MVP trophy . Hammon matched the tone with a structural tweak that mattered: players would build and present their own scouting reports before coaches weighed in. Accountability stopped being a slogan and became the operating system. “A’ja comes in with a laptop,” Hammon told ESPN. “They’ll kick the coaches out and do their thing.” Only then does the image that will live on come into focus – two nights before the sweep, before a sold-out Phoenix crowd of 17,071 at full boil – Wilson rising, spinning and feathering home an eight-footer with 0.3 seconds left in Game 3 as DeWanna Bonner and Alyssa Thomas crowded her airspace. That shot – thought to be the first buzzer-beater over a married couple in basketball history – didn’t just win a game. It effectively sealed the Aces’ place in WNBA lore. The sweep will be the headline, but the spine of this title is that midseason decision to choose standards over excuses. It carried through an edgy playoff run that tried to jar them loose: Seattle forced a decisive Game 3 that needed Jackie Young’s late put-back ; Indiana dragged them into an overtime Game 5 that would have cracked lesser champions. “There were a lot of doubts besides in that locker room,” Aces point guard Chelsea Gray said. “We stayed the course and trusted the process the entire time.” Las Vegas Aces And always, there was Wilson: shrinking options at the rim and expanding them at the elbow, the league’s most terrifying deterrent and its cleanest late-clock answer in the same body. There’s a special joy in watching her go about her work. If her Game 3 winner was the cinematic flourish, her Game 4 closeout was the masterclass in control when the jumpers weren’t falling. On a night where she missed 14 of her 21 attempts from the floor, Wilson changed the terms instead – owning the glass, spiking shots, jumping passing lanes, making a home at the stripe and going 17-for-19 there. Possession by possession, she bent the game back to her will. This year pushes past tidy résumé-building and into something rarer. Wilson wasn’t just the best player in this series; she was the best player in the sport, shouldering into a GOAT conversation that has long begun with Cheryl Miller’s legend and Maya Moore’s incandescent peak. She bears the weight lightly, which is part of the spell. The tambourine bit at the podium during the post-game presser – equal parts Baptist church joke and credo on patience and faith – landed because it sounded like her: unguarded, joyful, before quietly matter-of-fact and clear-eyed in expounding on the work it takes to win. A’ja Wilson of the Las Vegas Aces, left, celebrates in front of Satou Sabally of the Phoenix Mercury after making a basket during Game 2 of the WNBA finals. Photograph: Ian Maule/Getty Images Asked to redefine greatness now that she’s stacking championships at a historic clip, Wilson widened the lens. “Obviously I would still [say] banners, but I think greatness is … it’s who you’re around. This is greatness. This group here, we were battle-tested, top to bottom battle-tested. We showed up every single day with a mind of being great,” she said in Friday’s aftermath. “You’ve got to be great when the lights aren’t on you. You’ve got to be great when nobody’s in the gym with you. You’ve got to be great when you may not get anything on the end. That is what greatness is to me because that is consistency and that is just you doing the right things because it’s right.” Hammon’s appraisal supplied a blunt epigraph to the season: you can debate basketball’s Mount Rushmore if you want, but Wilson is “alone on Everest”. That sounds like flattery until you try to explain Wilson’s 2025 without resorting to the obvious truth that she controlled both ends of the court more completely than any of her peers. The Aces’ stars toggled roles without complaint – Young from flamethrower to rebounding guard; Gray from closer to organizer; free-agent addition Jewell Loyd (now 10-0 in WNBA finals games , by the way) from gunner to grit – and the bench minutes that once felt like a liability turned into leverage thanks to Dana Evans and company. But it all orbited the same gravitational pull of their 6ft 4in talisman. The closer a series got to wobble-time, the calmer Wilson seemed to breathe. Where it goes from here is business as much as basketball. Much of the WNBA’s workforce, including key Aces, approach free agency as the deadline for a new collective bargaining agreement ticks louder. That uncertainty hovered even as the confetti fell. It also hovered over a fortnight of renewed friction between the league office and locker rooms. Reports of comments attributed to commissioner Cathy Engelbert about players being “on their knees” in gratitude – which the Englebert has partially disputed – landed like a cymbal crash against the reality on the floor: the players are the product. The Mortgage Matchup Center crowd underscored that point with a cacophony of boos during Englebert’s trophy presentation, while Gray did it from the dais. “When you have great players, you need to treat them like that. That’s payment. That’s treatment. That’s revenue share,” she said. “There’s no league without the players.” In the end, two scenes bookend the truth of this season: an August text on the night of a 53-point embarrassment, and an October fadeaway that hushed a cauldron in the desert. The improbable midseason swerve into inevitability – the choice to recommit, then the refusal to blink – turned both into canon. The Aces rediscovered their standard at rock bottom and rode it back to the summit. Perhaps the verdict, delivered by the player who just authored a season like no other, was in from the start.",https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/oct/11/aja-wilson-goat-aces-sweep-wnba-finals-quadruple-crown,Sport,BBC,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/19fa9451396fab27286bbc04971c9134a9fa3c69/407_0_4068_3255/master/4068.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=5877386f3d7adce7ce849b3da4bb2d46",2025-10-11T17:33:55+00:00,4ea2a4ca67a63fb95c2bba97f39a9d283a59f80c
f7c6f8d06397,Craig Bellamy hopes ‘special moment’ arrives for Wales in vital Belgium clash,,"Craig Bellamy said he believes a “special moment” is brewing for Wales and hopes the perfect storm arrives when they host Belgium in Monday’s crunch World Cup qualifier. Wales’s fate is in their hands after Belgium were held against Group J leaders North Macedonia and victory in Cardiff would keep alive the hosts’ hopes of qualifying automatically. Wales are seeking to bounce back from a 3-0 friendly defeat against England at Wembley, which the captain, Ben Davies, who is poised to win his 100th cap against Belgium, said provided a “wakeup call” and prompted a “quiet journey back to Cardiff” on Friday, hours before the squad were boosted by watching their next opponents draw in Ghent. Bellamy discussed the importance of heading into Monday’s game in a positive mindset. “I always believe there is a special moment coming, I can’t and won’t allow myself to feel the other way,” the Wales manager said. “Positivity is something I have to have around me, from my coaches, players; body language, I’m very big on that, how you present yourself, it’s so important. I only ever see good. Trust me, there was a period where I only ever saw the other side. I know which side I want to see. Being positive is everything.” Bellamy said Wales can use their previous experience of big nights in the capital to their advantage. “Players have been in this situation so many times over the last 10 years, especially Cardiff nights. The crowd are used to these moments. “When we’ve managed to qualify it’s been here. I didn’t get to experience that [as a player] – usually at this stage I was out of the group – so it’s nice to be able to get to three games left and a huge game on Monday that if we win, it’s a nice start to the remaining games.” Bellamy added that defeat against Thomas Tuchel’s England only fuelled his determination to improve Wales. “How can I close that gap? How can I get to where he is? And if I get there: how can I overtake him?” he said. skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Football Daily Kick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of football Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

0074fd0a2bac,"Best goals, biggest gaffes: Premier League fans assess the season so far",,"Arsenal Story so far Top of the table, looking down at our rivals, despite still not really firing on all cylinders … it’s early days, but we’re struggling to keep a lid on the excitement here. Having star turns such as Havertz, Madueke and now Ødegaard succumb to long-term injury is a reminder of the risk of being derailed, but it does feel like we’ve never been better equipped to cope with the slings and arrows. Arteta is still unwrapping his new toys and figuring out the best way to use them – can’t wait to see how the chemistry develops. Best 90 mins Newcastle away . Worst 90 mins These were far from our worst all-round displays, but the source of most frustration so far was the timid approach taken against both Liverpool and Manchester City when our two biggest competitors were there for the taking. Best goal The 93rd-minute equaliser by Martinelli against City. Eze’s assist and Martinelli’s finish were exquisite and a much-needed confidence boost for both players. It blew the stadium roof off, too. Best opponent Love him or hate him, Haaland is an unstoppable beast. We’re waiting to see Viktor Gyökeres match his impact. Worst VAR moment Overturning the penalty awarded for Nick Pope bringing down Gyökeres at St James’ Park. It took them several minutes to find a reason. As both Saka and Arteta said later, where was the clear and obvious error that demanded VAR get involved? Next manager sacked Postecoglou. By Christmas we will be “Top of the world, Ma.” Gabriel Martinelli’s 93rd-minute equaliser against Manchester City drops over Gianluigi Donnarumma. Photograph: Catherine Ivill/AMA/Getty Images Aston Villa Story so far A terrible, lethargic start against sides mostly expected to be lower reaches may come back to haunt us in May but, glass half full, we’re now on a seven-game unbeaten run. The window was a disappointing one, and the new blood has yet to fire. Elliott is probably good but looks like he’s running through treacle and Guessand splits opinion, though I think he’ll be OK. Thankfully, more recently, with McGinn scoring freely and the back four miserly again (hard to believe Konsa could get any better but he has) there have been clear signs our evolving style will reap rewards. And, excitingly, we’ve started very brightly in Europe. If we can get Watkins and Rogers back on the same wavelength we can challenge the protected elite. Best 90 mins 2-1 at home to Burnley doesn’t scream emphatic, but their keeper was inspired and several of our key players looked on the verge of fully recapturing their best form. This too was a day when Bogarde showed he’s ready for serious top-flight work. Worst 90 mins Sunday at 7pm at home to bogey team Crystal Palace had “end to long home unbeaten record” written all over it. And so it proved, spinelessly so, a clear nadir since Emery took over. Best goal Malen’s second against Burnley was textbook half-opening to net ripple. Best opponent The boy Josh King at Fulham . Electric pace and clearly not a ‘speedboat with no driver’. Worst VAR moment Was King’s disallowed goal at Chelsea . In a crowded field, it was a new low for VAR. Next manager sacked Amorim. By Christmas we will be Top of the Europa League, and ninth in the league. Donyell Malen celebrates scoring his second for Villa against Burnley. Photograph: David Klein/Reuters Bournemouth Story so far An astonishing start. Written off by many so-called media experts (again), we’re outperforming expectations (again). It’s only seven games played, but to be unbeaten in six of those since the narrow defeat at Anfield on the opening day is remarkable. The recruitment team deserve great credit in the replacements they’ve brought in, replacing Kepa, Zabarnyi, Huijsen and Kerkez with Petrovic, Diakité, Milosavljevic and Truffert. The coaching team led by Andoni Iraola have done an outstanding job in getting them performing so seamlessly. What’s been equally impressive is the way existing squad members have really stepped up their games, led by David Brooks. Alex Scott, Tyler Adams, Evanilson, Marcos Senesi and, of course, the world-class talent that is Antoine Semenyo are all performing brilliantly. Right now, the Cherries are flying and we’re loving it. Best 90 mins Spurs away . Off the back of beating Man City the week before, Spurs were humbled at home. We nullified their attack, dominated the game and overwhelmed them with our fluent attacking play. One of the most comprehensive 1-0 wins you’ll ever see. Worst 90 mins We lacked our usual intensity away at Leeds but still came back to grab a 2-2 draw. Our first ever point at Elland Road. Best goal Can I have two, please? Semenyo and Kluivert at home to Fulham. Both worldies for different reasons. Best opponent Sean Longstaff, Leeds. Worst VAR moment It’s hard to beat that wrongly disallowed Fulham goal from Josh King at Chelsea. Disgraceful officiating. Next manager sacked Amorim. By Christmas we will be Fourth, and still punching gloriously above our weight. Antoine Semenyo scored twice against Fulham. Photograph: Robin Jones/AFC Bournemouth/Getty Images Brentford Story so far Thomas Frank leaves. Backroom staff follow. Top scorer Bryan Mbeumo departs. Second top scorer Yoanne Wissa goes on strike. Captain Christian Nørgaard leaves. We promote set-piece coach Keith Andrews to head coach. We bring Ouattara in from Bournemouth for a record fee to replace Mbeumo which has opposition fans sniggering, but can’t replace Wissa because he leaves on deadline day. Everyone piles in on Brentford predicting relegation. We then lose to Forest in the opening match. The pile-on continues. We then go and beat Aston Villa and Man United and draw with Chelsea – putting us on exactly the same points tally as the same stage last season under Thomas Frank. The pile-on dies down. We knew it would be a rollercoaster of a season. So far, it hasn’t disappointed. Best 90 mins We were excellent against Chelsea, but the United game was on another level in terms of excitement. We went two up and were cruising, gifted them a goal, conceded a penalty (which they missed), then smashed in an absolute screamer in stoppage time to seal it. Perfect. Worst 90 mins The 3-1 defeat at Fulham. Incredibly poor all over the park. Best goal Thiago’s finish against United was incredible, but Jensen’s strike in the same game edges it: a slick nine-pass move from back to front finished with an absolute rocket. Best opponent Elliot Anderson stood out against us on the opening day for Forest although to be fair, anyone could’ve bossed our midfield that afternoon. Worst VAR moment United’s penalty against us took about three years to sort . VAR checked the foul, then spent even longer deciding if Collins should be sent off. Add subs and other delays, and by the time it was finally taken Bruno Fernandes had lost the will to live and Kelleher saved it. Next manager sacked I tipped Nuno in my pre-season predictions, so I’ll try to keep the streak going. Next up is Ange. Things aren’t looking great for him right now. By Christmas we will be 14th. Manchester United’s Altay Bayindir looks dejected after Mathias Jensen scores Brentford’s third. Photograph: Andrew Couldridge/Action Images/Reuters Brighton Story so far It hasn’t been a storming start but having nine points reflects the fact we’re a young squad with lots of new players. Fabian Hürzeler has come under fire from some fans but we need to manage our expectations. We’ve sold our best players for huge sums in recent seasons and our top scorer went this summer. We’re in good financial shape and have to stay patient as we continue to build. There will be many moments of joy this season. Probably the only surprise is that Carlos Baleba has looked so lost since Manchester United and all their cash came knocking, but he’s bound to find his feet again. Best 90 mins It’s always a great feeling to beat Chelsea & Hove Albion , especially away, and after João Pedro’s claim that he was the main man at Brighton. And Hürzeler’s quadruple substitution that resulted in the comeback win over Man City was the single best moment so far. Worst 90 mins The horribly disappointing 1-1 draw at Wolves, yawn. Best goal Brajan Gruda’s 89th-minute winner against City, with a big shoutout to Diego Gómez who scored four – including one 30-yard half-volley – in the Carabao Cup at Barnsley. Best opponent Jack Grealish was annoyingly good and got both assists in Everton’s 2-0 win over us at Hill Dickinson Stadium. Worst VAR moment It feels as if there’s been an argument raging over VAR every weekend for ages now, it’s so boring. Apart from when Palace are on the wrong end of it, of course. It’s always fun when they have one disallowed. Next manager sacked Postecoglou. By Christmas we will be Seventh. Brajan Gruda puts Brighton 2-1 ahead at Manchester City at the Amex in August. Photograph: Crystal Pix/MB Media/Getty Images Burnley Story so far It’s probably gone largely as expected given the run of games we’ve had. We’ve been competitive in a lot of them but also been the architects of our own misfortune in a couple. Points-wise, we’re probably about par – but the next run of fixtures is going to be crucial. Best 90 mins Probably Sunderland at home . It’s our only win but it came on the back of them winning their opening game and us getting beaten in ours. I think they thought they’d turn up at the Turf and roll us over, but they didn’t. Worst 90 mins Villa away in the last game. We weren’t terrible like we were so many times under Vincent Kompany in the Premier League , but we were still well off it. Best goal We’ve scored a couple of nice ones but I’d probably go for Lyle Foster at United . It was a lovely, well-worked goal and a superb strike from Lyle. We need a bit more of that from him. Best opponent I don’t think there’s been that many standout individual performances against us so far. I’d probably go with Villa’s Donyell Malen, who took both his goals so well. He’s everything we probably miss in terms of ability to finish, so that’s why he probably stands out so much for me. Worst VAR moment Lyle Foster having his goal chalked off at Manchester United. I’ve still not seen an image which convinces me he was offside. If we’re still going to rule out goals for tiny amounts of shirt sleeves being in an offside position it’s time to pack up and go home. Next manager sacked Big Ange. Not sure why he was in such a hurry to take that job. By Christmas we will be We’ll still be in the relegation mixer but probably just above the line – 17th. Lyle Foster scores Burnley’s first against Manchester United at Old Trafford in August. Photograph: Martin Rickett/PA Chelsea Story so far An indifferent start. We do show signs of great potential and play some lovely football at times but all too quickly revert to the dull passing game where we always seem to be looking backwards. Stupid errors aren’t helping, either – and we’ve been very unlucky with injuries. But if we can build on the Liverpool win and the excitement that generated on and off the pitch then things will quickly get better. Best 90 mins That victory over Liverpool had everything – end-to-end football with us on the front foot, and a last‑minute winner. Even after conceding and the two defensive injuries, the team continued to fight. Hats off to Maresca for how he managed the situation; the subs made a difference. Wild scenes at the final whistle. Worst 90 mins The loss at Manchester United. The early red card didn’t help but Maresca panicking and making some bizarre changes set the tone against the worst United team we’ve faced for years. He has since admitted he mishandled it. Let’s hope he’s learned from it, and from the Brighton home defeat. Best goal Caicedo’s screamer against Liverpool : an absolute rocket. Best opponent I hate to praise an ex-Spurs player but it was Harry Kane in our Champions league game. He’s on fire this season and is the type of centre-forward I’d love to see at the Bridge. Worst VAR moment Disallowing Josh King’s goal against us. Hard not to enjoy all the squealing from our neighbours down the Fulham Road, though. Next manager sacked Postecoglou. By Christmas we will be Comfortably fourth, if we avoid the red cards. Moisés Caicedo scores Chelsea’s opener against Liverpool at Stamford Bridge. Photograph: Ian Walton/AP Crystal Palace Story so far We’re all living the dream right now. Ignoring last week’s defeat at Everton (we should have won easily), to go 19 games undefeated, picking up the Community Shield on the way, qualifying for the Conference League, winning our first game in Europe and be fighting for the top places in the Premier League is an unbelievable achievement. We can’t wait to see how this season will unfold. Best 90 mins Liverpool at home without a doubt; the first half should have seen us four or five up, and to grab the win we fully deserved with the last kick of the game was a brilliant moment on the pitch and in the stands. Villa away was also a masterclass, and the sheer ease with which we beat Dynamo Kyiv in the Conference League shows just how far we have come. Worst 90 mins Slightly bending the rules here given it was Europe, but our 0-0 snorefest in Fredrikstad when we struggled against the low block and an artificial pitch: one of the worst games I have ever seen, and made worse by the huge cost in going to see it! Best goal Marc Guéhi’s top-corner curler against Villa. Honourable mention to Tyrick Mitchell for his acrobatic right-foot volley to win the points at West Ham yet again. Best opponent Sunderland keeper Robin Roefs was absolutely superb at Selhurst, he single-handedly kept us at bay in a match we should have won easily. Worst VAR moment The one-off enforcing of the one-metre-away-from the-wall law ruling out Eze’s sumptuous free-kick at Chelsea. VAR at its absolute inconsistent joy-vacuuming best. Next manager sacked Postecoglou. By Christmas we will be Eighth. Marc Guehi celebrates his top-corner curler for Palace against Aston Villa. Photograph: Alex Livesey/Getty Images Everton Story so far Eighth in the table, unbeaten at home, Grealish providing joy that’s been missing for oh so long, Dewsbury-Hall showing what a quality player he is, Pickford outstanding – yet there’s still a feeling we could be better placed. Poor first halves have been our downfall versus Leeds and Liverpool and scoring remains a problem too, with neither Barry nor Beto demanding ownership of the fabled No 9 shirt. Best 90 mins Performing for the full 90 minutes has been the problem, with slow starts the predominant feature. But the opening home game against Brighton was probably the most complete. Worst 90 mins Easily, by some margin, the Carabao Cup game at Wolves. Having previously emphasised the importance of winning a trophy we made wholesale changes and went out with a whimper. A shocking display in front of a capacity away support as always. Best goal Given it was our first last-minute goal at Hill Dickinson, given it ended Palace’s fabulous unbeaten run, given the circumstances, the scorer and how it was scored, it has to be Jack Grealish’s strike . It wouldn’t make any other team’s list of best goals but in this context it was magic. Best opponent Crysencio Summerville was exceptional for West Ham, but probably Adam Wharton shades it. Before they tired, Palace really looked an excellent team, extremely well coached by Oliver Glasner. Worst VAR moment The penalty given against James Tarkowski versus Leeds. Everything that’s wrong about the system in one shocking incident. They confirmed it for “leaning into the ball” despite Tarkowski’s arm being by his side. Next manager sacked Postecoglou. By Christmas we will be There’s a tough run coming up, but I’m confident Moyes will keep us in eighth. Jack Grealish celebrates his winner for Everton against Crystal Palace. Photograph: Allstar Picture Library Ltd/Ed Sykes/Apl/Sportsphoto Fulham Story so far Disappointing. Instead of heading into the break in a lofty slot brimming with confidence, we’re aiming to regroup. Injuries haven’t helped, but then neither has some untypical sloppiness and lack of focus. Very unprofessional. As has been the undue influence of Mr Webb and his underlings. Best 90 mins Came at the Bridge , only for the video-powers-that-be to intervene, finding a way to rule out Josh King’s goal. Still, they apologised, so that’s all right. Move on; nothing to see here. The Brentford game was also a good display: after presenting them with the opener we ran out deserved 3-1 winners. Worst 90 mins It was vice versa at Villa Park. An early lead against nervy hosts only to crumble once they snatched a route-one leveller before the break. Further key decisions went against us in the first half, but that’s no excuse for the collapse and 3-1 loss. Best goal Josh King at Chelsea to propel us to a famous victory. But no. Spuriously chalked off because the Stockley Park mob said so: a clear and obvious cock-up. That leaves Harry Wilson’s clever finish from Alex Iwobi’s brilliant pass against the Bees in top spot. Best opponent Antoine Semenyo or Matheus Cunha. Or Howard Webb. Worst VAR moment I’ve covered the specifics, so here’s the general. VAR is fine in principle but its implementation remains an utter farce. And the game is far, far worse as a result. Delays, disappointment and obfuscation. It was introduced to mop up “clear and obvious errors” with a “high bar for interventions”. Like hell. That clanger at Chelsea was the most publicised but others, particularly against Man United and Villa, not only highlighted the flaws and made a solid case for favouritism (yikes!) but probably cost us points. Variously Applied Rules. Next manager sacked Probably Ange. By Christmas we will be 14th. Josh King races away to celebrate his strike at Chelsea – before VAR intervened. Photograph: Hannah McKay/Reuters Leeds Story so far Leeds are always getting trapped between expectation, hope and reality. So far this doesn’t look like a team destined to go straight back down, which is better than most promoted sides expect. But throwing away late points against Fulham and Bournemouth and not getting anything from a good performance against Spurs has created tantalising hope. Hold on to those points and Leeds could be flying in sixth. We’ve hardly seen new goalie Lucas Perri or new centre-back Jaka Bijol, while injuries to Dan James and Wilf Gnonto have me feeling there’s more to come from this team. If “more” includes Dominic Calvert-Lewin finishing half his chances, well, then I will be in danger of getting giddy. Harsher reality is coming, though: Man City, Chelsea then Liverpool in one week. But before that are five games from which Leeds can pick up points, and need to, to keep this working smoothly. Best 90 mins Most have been good. I’ve enjoyed competitive games after two years playing attack against defence in the Championship. Wolves was best because we scored goals and won . Worst 90 mins Arsenal away. But we’ve all moved on. We hope. Best goal Anton Stach’s direct free-kick at Wolves . We’ve rarely seen free-kicks going in since Pablo Hernández retired. skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Football Daily Kick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of football Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

I’m setting a challenge for someone to make him come back the next day to take one behind closed doors. Next manager sacked I’m still on Keith Andrews watch, especially now Russell Martin is free to take over. By Christmas we will be 14th. Anton Stach curves his direct free-kick into the net against Wolves in September. Photograph: Chris Radburn/Reuters Liverpool Story so far The season was going swimmingly up until the last-minute goal for Palace two weeks ago. That ended our unbeaten run and started a new run of consecutive defeats. Now three of them. The first time in Arne Slot’s career and so the first time for us for some time. It’s not so great not being on an unbeaten high, but the season is barely two months old and certainly no time for kneejerk panic. Yes, we need to find our best lineup, yes, the new players need to integrate and yes, players need to find form. But as Virgil said, we’ll stick together and go again. And we will. Best 90 mins The first at home to Bournemouth . From 2-0 to 2-2 we then scored two, on 88 and 94, to take the win and set a precedent for the weeks to come. Goals for Ekitiké, Gakpo, Chiesa and Salah made for a business-as-usual start to the season on a less-than-usual Friday night. Worst 90 mins Came at Palace. We were not good and they knew how to play us. We nearly got out of jail again with a last-minute equaliser, but then came Nketiah with his version of our late routine. Best goal For sheer thrills, the winner at Newcastle from Rio Ngumoha , then just 16. Brilliant buildup starting with Chiesa to Salah, a pass fizzed across the box, ace dummy from Szoboszlai and the final shot blasted into the top corner. Best opponent Bournemouth’s Antoine Semenyo scored his side’s two goals, one of them running from his own half, evading our defence, before shooting on the edge of the area past Alisson. Worst VAR moment The penalty given against us away to Galatasaray is one of the worst decisions we’ve had. A shocker. Next manager sacked Postecoglou. By Christmas we will be Top again. Liverpool teenager Rio Ngumoha celebrates his dramatic winner at Newcastle. Photograph: Andy Buchanan/AFP/Getty Images Manchester City Story so far I’m pretty satisfied. The early consecutive losses to Spurs and Brighton were obviously disappointing, but I think the signs since have been encouraging. Defensively we’ve been a lot better since Gvardiol’s return and the progress of O’Reilly and Khusanov. Four out of six points in the Champions League is a decent start. Foden is “back”, and Haaland has started outrageously well. Best 90 mins I don’t think there’s been a clear ‘best performance’ yet in the league, though we were dominant in the 5-1 win over Burnley . But beating United comfortably at the Etihad was most satisfying, obviously (and needed at the time after two consecutive losses). Worst 90 mins The 2-0 loss to Spurs. Tottenham plus Thomas Frank really is our kryptonite. Defensively we were really poor and our pressing was a mess too. Spurs deservedly punished us. Best goal Haaland’s versus Arsenal. It was a brilliant counterattack. Erling’s movement and physicality to get into space was amazing. Reijnders’ pass. And of course, the big man’s slotted finish . Best opponent No player has shone against us yet but Djed Spence was very solid against Bobb and Cherki. Worst VAR moment For us, without doubt the penalty given against Nico González at Monaco. Never a penalty, even by Champions League refereeing standards. Elsewhere, the decision not to award Josh King’s goal against Chelsea was a bad one too. Next manager sacked It’s going to be Ruben Amorim, isn’t it? By Christmas we will be Second. I think we’re trending well and are going under the radar, which I’m loving. This is a completely new City team this season. It’s going to take a bit of time, but the underlying metrics look good. Erling Haaland slots home for Manchester City at Arsenal in September. Photograph: Matthew Childs/Action Images/Reuters Manchester United Story so far Adding three attackers and a new keeper injected some optimism that this season would be different. As it is, so far what we’ve got is one-game cycles where we win one and lose one. You can see by the players’ body language that they aren’t happy with Amorim’s system: they’re routinely outplayed and outworked. We have beaten three teams at home – two promoted clubs and a team playing with 10 men for most of the game. We haven’t won an away game since Leicester in March. Teams can suss us out too easily: even Grimsby knew what to do. Opponents seem to relish telling the press after games how easy it is to play against us as they know how we set up, and Amorim won’t do anything about it, setting the team up the same, week after week. Best 90 mins The Arsenal game where we made a hatful of chances. Despite the defeat I left the ground feeling we just might be heading in the right direction. Didn’t last. Worst 90 mins Grimsby was excruciating. Amorim not watching the penalties was gobsmacking; as Napoleon said: “If you build an army of 100 lions and their leader is a dog, in any fight, the lions will die like a dog. But if you build an army of 100 dogs and their leader is a lion, all dogs will fight as a lion.” Best goal Mount’s goal against Sunderland showed real class. Best opponent Haaland by a street. To think Ole offered him to us for £4m when he managed him at Molde. Worst VAR moment When Saliba went through Cunha in the season opener. He took his left leg; VAR shrugged it off. Next manager sacked Postecoglou. By Christmas we will be 10th. Ruben Amorim sits in the dugout during United’s shootout defeat against Grimsby. Photograph: Sky Sports Newcastle Story so far It’s been disappointing, but what could we expect? A disrupted pre-season and injuries to new recruits Yoane Wissa and Jacob Ramsey have undoubtedly stymied our campaign. Yet there are encouraging signs. In Nick Woltemade we have a new cult hero and a striker loving life at St James’ – so it’s bye-bye, AI, you’ll soon be forgotten. And the imperious Malick Thiaw, who has contributed to a string of clean sheets, is a joy to watch. With Dan Burn, Fabian Schär, Sven Botman and now Thiaw to call on, plus two sensational full-backs, our defence is the best it’s been in decades. Best 90 mins Surprisingly, the home loss against LiVARpool . We went full throttle from the off and a ferocious atmosphere inspired a stirring fightback while we were down to 10 men. Of course we lost it in Slot time to a 16-year-old debutant, but St James’ was a cauldron that night. Worst 90 mins Arsenal at home. We lacked possession and failed to protect a (somewhat fortuitous) lead. Two late sucker-punch goals – both from corners – were agonising. Best goal Bruno Guimarães’ stunner against Forest . A moment of class in a frustrating contest. Best opponent Barcelona’s Pedri. One of the world’s finest technical midfielders: elegant, intelligent, incisive, he ran the show. Worst VAR moment We thought VAR was there to intervene in violent incidents. Apparently we were wrong. Gabriel got away with striking Woltemade in the face during our home loss, then went on to score the winner. Next manager sacked Postecoglou. He should probably be given time, but results (and the fans) seem to be turning. By Christmas we will be If Wissa starts firing, fifth isn’t out of the question. Bruno Guimarães celebrates his opener against Nottingham Forest. Photograph: Alex Dodd/CameraSport/Getty Images Nottingham Forest Story so far Just when Reds fans thought it was safe to feel optimistic, it all went to pot. The change of head coach might well have derailed the Premier League, Europa League and Carabao Cup campaigns. It all feels so avoidable. Best 90 mins In the league it was our only win, the opening day against Brentford ; Nuno’s Reds showed they didn’t just play a low-mid block and could stroke it around, with three goals in the bag. Overall, the best performance was the first half against Real Betis. Worst 90 mins Cynics will say all of them under Ange, but actually, the home defeat against West Ham still felt worse. It was a performance that precipitated Nuno’s departure and in which the players were clearly feeling the weight of the situation at the club. Best goal Chris Wood against Brentford : a sublime first-time pass by Elliot Anderson and a well-timed run by the veteran striker, before he rounded the keeper and tapped home. Definitely one for the football nostalgists. Also, Igor Jesus’s first against Betis; brilliant team play and a great cross by Morgan Gibbs-White into the corridor of uncertainty, before the Brazilian struck. Forest are back, baby (at least for a few minutes). Best opponent Granit Xhaka for Sunderland; he was utterly in control of everything that was happening. Worst VAR moment We’ve had a few dodgy ref calls, as often happens when things aren’t going your way; I would have liked VAR to look at Nico Domínguez’s yellow card against Sunderland for simulation after getting caught by a high boot – I bet you won’t see that given again this season. Next manager sacked Postecoglou. By Christmas we will be 16th, but doing better than right now. Chris Wood delivered against Brentford on the opening day. Photograph: Ritchie Sumpter/Nottingham Forest FC/Getty Images Sunderland Story so far It’s started better than anyone could have imagined. Every match has been a joy to watch and after so many frustrating years it finally feels like fans are getting the reward we deserve. Régis Le Bris has brought belief, purpose and an identity that feels special. His football is brave, intelligent and exciting, and every week it feels like something is building. Best 90 mins The opening-day win against West Ham was everything we had dreamed of. Confident, ruthless and full of energy, it was the perfect return to Premier League football. The atmosphere that day was incredible, it felt like we were back. Worst 90 mins The defeat by Burnley was tough to take. It came so early in the season, just after the joy of that opening win, when positivity was sky high. It brought us back down to earth a little, reminding us that this league is relentless. It was sobering. Best goal Isidor’s against Brentford was a thing of beauty . From Xhaka’s perfect delivery to the instinctive finish, it summed up everything this team is about. Coming from behind and showing that same “till the end” spirit that got us promoted, it felt like a moment that was truly Sunderland. Best opponent Amad, without question. Seeing him again, this time for United, was bittersweet. His talent is effortless and even though his brilliance came at our expense, it was impossible not to stop and admire him. Worst VAR moment It has mostly been kind since our return, but the overturned penalty against United was frustrating. Still, after it saved us in the playoff final, I will take the rough with the smooth. Next manager sacked Amorim feels like the obvious shout. United cannot drift like this for ever. Change feels inevitable. By Christmas we will be 10th, full of belief, and absolutely loving it. Wilson Isidor celebrates scoring Sunderland’s second on the opening day. Photograph: Owen Humphreys/PA Tottenham Story so far Third place, the best away record, solid and neither flamboyant nor chaotic. Some are critical of Thomas Frank’s football, calling it defensive, crying about xG, but he’s only just got here. Relax. We have ourselves a proper coach. We need stability, momentum will follow, then flair. New players, rejuvenated stars … we just need to marinate before the flavours sizzle. Best 90 mins Leeds away . Not pretty – we dug deep, played our football, produced moments of quality, and proved we’re a team, one that has some bite, spirit. We pressed extremely well and fired in plenty of crosses that a finished-article forward would have relished. Work in progress. Play Xavi at 10. Be patient. Worst 90 mins Bodø/Glimt in the Champions League. Artificial turf, rotation; a messy away day. But even the worst this season has involved fighting spirit in the form of a comeback. Spurs do “bad” good. Best goal Richy’s against Burnley : the most dazzling “oh my days” moment. It had me spiraling towards a supernova. Best opponent Antoine Semenyo. Baller. I want the new THFC board to action their battle cry: we need ruthless balance, Kudus on one side, Semenyo on the other, Xavi through the middle. Make this fan-fiction a reality. Worst VAR moment My brain shuts down in the time it takes for them to decide if my “limbs” lost in celebration will count for nothing. I do enjoy that rarity when a ref runs off to the screen to review and sticks with his original decision, though. Drama. Next manager sacked Postecoglou. By Christmas we will be Top five, just to generate hype and push us back into a self-fulfilling prophecy where we expect too much, too soon – even though the reality is we finished 17th last season and lost 22 games. I’m going with third. Don’t judge me. Football is more fun like this. Richarlison watches his acrobatic effort fly into Burnley’s net. Photograph: Matthew Childs/Action Images/Reuters West Ham Story so far Sacking Potter after six games tells its own story, though the real problem is the lack of strategy from the owners. Potter was a decent man but his side’s slow buildup and leaky back line were less than magic. We should be mid-table with this squad but the defence stopped being able to deal with corners and new keeper Hermansen appeared to be suffering from PTSD. Midfield signings Fernandes and Magassa arrived too late and the home losses to Chelsea and Spurs were embarrassing. At least Nuno might help lift the mood of apathy; he already appears more inspirational than Potter and his counterattacking style better suited. We’re in a relegation scrap, but Nuno has tightened up the defence and given youth a chance. Best 90 mins The 3-0 win at Forest , admittedly aided by the imminent sacking of Nuno, then the home manager. Three goals in the final six minutes was decidedly enjoyable. Potter’s only highlight. Worst 90 mins Spurs was bad, but the 5-1 home defeat against Chelsea was abject defending, conceding three goals from corners and failing to hold an early lead. Our defence looked dodgier than a Nigel Farage pledge. Best goal Paquetá’s long-range effort against Chelsea stands out, though Bowen’s goals at Forest and Everton were fine strikes too. Thank goodness both the Dyers are keeping Jarrod loyal to WHU. Best opponent Chelsea’s Estêvão is only 18 but terrorised us, treating Tomas Soucek like a training cone. And that Declan Rice at Arsenal looked quite good. Worst VAR moment Niclas Füllkrug had an equaliser against Chelsea disallowed for a toe offside. That goal might have got his season going; so far he’s struggled. Next manager sacked Postecoglou at Forest doesn’t seem to be going down too well, mate. By Christmas we will be 17th. West Ham’s Lucas Paqueta scores from distance against Chelsea. Photograph: Dylan Martinez/Reuters Wolves Story so far Rock bottom and no wins from the first seven – not great. The struggle was expected, so I’m not entirely surprised. We’ve taken the lead in the last three matches and only two late equalisers have denied us that much-needed first victory. We’re starting to look more competitive, and the progress in the League Cup has been a pleasant distraction. There’s still hope. Best 90 mins We came agonisingly close to a deserved win over Spurs . After we were taken apart by Leeds the previous weekend, Vítor Pereira made wholesale changes and we looked more resilient. Worst 90 mins It would have to be that Leeds game. We went ahead with a brilliantly worked goal, but instead of growing in confidence we wilted. Leeds were comfortably the better side, albeit handed the win with atrocious defending for at least two of their three goals. Best goal Ladislav Krejci looks a great signing. He started in midfield against Leeds and timed a run perfectly to get on the end of an inch-perfect Fer López pass . A classy team goal in another otherwise honking team performance. Best opponent Jack Grealish got a couple of assists for Everton, but it was more the controlled manner in which he went about his business. It just oozed class and experience. Worst VAR moment Nothing too horrendous for us so far – thankfully. One minor gripe I will share is that I’m fairly certain (having been sat right behind it) the ball was moving when Brighton took a short corner for their late equaliser. In the age of hyper-correctness, should that have been spotted? Next manager sacked Postecoglou. By Christmas we will be 19th. We need to remain within touching distance of safety with a consistent, settled team. I think that’s easily possible. And from there, survival can be achieved with the right business in January. We’ve done it for the last two years, so why not again? Ladislav Krejci keeps his cool to score against Leeds.

df85566fc5af,Rangers could turn to Röhl after Steven Gerrard rules out return as manager,,"The former Sheffield Wednesday manager Danny Röhl is now the favourite to succeed Russell Martin at Rangers after Steven Gerrard dramatically withdrew from talks over the Ibrox post. Gerrard, who had returned from the Middle East to meet with Ibrox officials in London, had been the overwhelming choice of the Rangers support. Those directors now face an even bigger challenge to win over a seriously disgruntled fan base. Rangers want a new manager in place before Dundee United visit Ibrox on Saturday. Martin’s disastrous, 123-day Rangers stint ended after the draw at Falkirk on Sunday. Thoughts immediately turned towards Gerrard, who was in charge at Ibrox between 2018 and 2021. The former Liverpool captain has been out of work since leaving Al-Ettifaq in Saudi Arabia late January but has remained based in Bahrain. Danny Röhl has held talks with the owners of Rangers. Photograph: Cody Froggatt/PA Gerrard’s interest in the Rangers position was sufficient for him to travel to meet with a club delegation. Gerrard has now made it known he feels the time is not right to return to Ibrox. While the scenario has been portrayed as mutually friendly – and Rangers have not offered anyone the job – this constitutes another public relations blow the Ibrox hierarchy could well do without given the swell of support behind the ex-England captain. Röhl, who also met Rangers’ American ownership at the end of last week, was under serious consideration before Martin was hired in June. The 36-year-old’s spell at Wednesday was overshadowed by off-field problems . His lack of working involvement in Scottish football, though, is an issue Rangers observers will be keen to highlight. Röhl left Hillsborough in late July. He previously worked as a coach at RB Leipzig, Bayern Munich, Southampton and the German national team. Sean Dyche, who had earlier been linked with Rangers, had also made it clear he was not keen on the job.",https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/oct/11/rangers-could-turn-to-danny-rohl-after-steven-gerrard-rules-out-return-as-manager,Sport,BBC,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d6d99cd52bfee9b6651f2efbfd33ba78d3c2f60e/594_0_4350_3481/master/4350.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=018b4b7c503645bcb7555e0a721a3fab",2025-10-11T20:02:45+00:00,4e52a57d2926354d503f8ec8d1613e5b85b12bd2
f39651b8daf6,Former Arsenal midfielder Jack Wilshere in the frame for Luton job,,"Jack Wilshere, the former Arsenal and England midfielder, is reportedly close to taking over as the Luton manager. The 33-year-old has emerged as first choice to replace Matt Bloomfield, who was sacked this week, after holding talks with the club’s board at Kenilworth Road. Wilshere filled in at Norwich at the end of last season where he took charge for the final two games after Johannes Hoff Thorup’s sacking , but did not get the job permanently. He was also in the frame at Plymouth before Tom Cleverley was hired as manager. After back-to-back relegations, Luton’s slump has continued to alarm after they started the campaign with five defeats from their first 11 games in League One . Their fixture on Saturday was postponed due to international call-ups. Rotherham remain in the League One relegation zone despite a late winner to defeat Northampton 2-1. Sam Hoskins put Northampton ahead with a 26th-minute penalty – his 100th goal for the club, but Joe Rafferty equalised before a late free-kick from Josh Benson secured the points.

44791c2eccff,Flag alert! Gary Neville may not be Orwell but he is a very English type of patriot,,"“A t the far end of the food counter a group of men were pledging allegiance to the flag, with trays balanced in one hand, in order to be allowed to take seats at the table. A group that had arrived earlier was singing The Star-Spangled Banner in order that they might use the salt and pepper and ketchup there.” Welcome to our own Glorious Loyalty Oath Crusade, another real-time demonstration of the fact every satirical absurdity described in Catch-22 has become, yeah, pretty much totally plausible. The nation is now fully hostage to bad actors and phoney rage. And as ever football must act as a key amplifier of all this, a public echo chamber for the anxieties of what we must, out of a sense of duty, still call the real world. It took eight minutes for the crowd at Wembley on Thursday night to demonstrate that they have finally moved on from chanting Keir Starmer is a wanker. Instead they chanted Gary Neville is a wanker. Two days earlier Joey Barton, who exists in the public consciousness solely because of football, published a video to his 2.7 million X followers in which he said he would punch a disabled person in a wheelchair if they suggested a union flag should not be flown over a building site. To be fair, this does seem an unlikely scenario. Perhaps there could be an interim stage where the two of them try to have a chat about it first. But no. Joey would rather cut straight to the real business of violently vetting disabled people for patriotism, out there furiously overturning wheelchairs like Indiana Jones weaving through the souk looking for Marion inside a laundry basket. Sometimes, you just get the heroes you need. Here are two pretty sound ideas. First, if anyone ever asks you to take a flag seriously, they’re immediately to be distrusted. A flag is just some colours. A flag has no inherent fixed meaning. Flags are groupthink, a suspension of independent thought. The civil rights movement wasn’t defined by a flag. The fall of the Berlin Wall didn’t have a flag. The peace movement didn’t have a flag, just flowers, hair and chauvinistic sex. And second, there are few things more un-English than brandishing the flag like a weapon. For this reason alone I am proud of Gary Neville for speaking up this week about flags , for trying to make the point that it is un-patriotically un-English to go around insisting on English patriotism. The reaction to Gary Neville’s video message about flags and patriotism shows he was on to something, even if he did not articulate it well. Photograph: Gary Calton/The Guardian Neville is of course an easy target for accusations of luxury hypocrisy. He can be a doofus and a chop, the hammer of Qatar who will also work for the state broadcaster at Qatar’s propaganda World Cup, a Lineker-level degree of cognitive dissonance. And yes, in his speech Neville rambled widely, exposing the contradictions of pretty much every fixed position you may choose to take right now. He should also have condemned acts of Islamic terrorism, something people on the left often seem unable to do. He shouldn’t have focused solely on “angry white middle-aged men” in the wake of a double murder at a synagogue. It is also a ducking of what he seemed to want to say. Which was to talk specifically about Nigel Farage , who does need to be challenged openly, who is a deeply cynical threat to the public discourse, a campy and theatrical nihilist posing as a Real Person, who uses fear and division to manipulate people into voting for him. But I am still proud of Neville for speaking up. It is good that a sportsperson is addressing this, an actual issue in his hometown, and doing so with genuine feeling, unafraid of the violent reaction that will follow. This is his parish. He is an angry middle-aged white man, and has spent a lot of time around flags. For all his easily gotcha-contradictions Neville feels it, is well-intentioned and is worth a million Farages. And while it is easy to say Stick To Sport VAR-boy, the reality is this has everything to do with sport, a place that has been aggressively flag-draped and militarised, where even a radio interview in midweek with the deeply mild Chris Woakes ended with the phrase “Thank you for your service” as though Woakes has been out there killing the Taliban for the last 10 years. Above all the reaction to Neville’s video message proved he was on to something. Before long a Traitor Scum banner had appeared outside Old Trafford. On the internet Neville was pilloried over old video clips of him not singing God Save the Queen, a genuine moment of salt and pepper flag-pledge madness. The Daily Telegraph has had a permanent hate-erection for the last four days, and can only be a small step away from giving away Gary Neville wicker dolls for your children to burn with its weekend editions. Rumour has it four leader writers have already been hospitalised by rage. Most tellingly the same paper published a response from Farage that suggested Neville should be fired by his private sector employer for not wanting to fly a flag, an idea so absurd, so unpatriotic, so wilfully ignorant, it seems impossible nobody inside this mighty engine of English free speech didn’t feel uneasy about projecting it as a serious political message. skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Football Daily Kick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of football Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He said the messaging is getting dangerous. He said Brexit has had a terrible effect (see: the steel industry). He said we shouldn’t be pulled right and left. He said we must stop promoting abusive hate speech. He said he had ordered one of his building sites to take down a union flag because they had never previously flown one, and, like, it’s also just a building site. The best thing he said was that “the union flag being used in a negative fashion is not right”, something that is, intentionally or not, very George Orwell in its understanding of patriotism. Orwell gets marched around the place in a headlock all the time these days, dragged randomly into every debate. But he knew about symbols and flags and about Englishness and its values. Flags are prevalent at sporting events these days, but George Orwell said that a lack of reflexive flag-wagging was a key ingredient of English resilience and character. Photograph: Michael Regan/The FA/Getty Images In The Lion and the Unicorn, a love letter in support of the war against German fascism, he writes that a lack of reflexive flag-wagging is a key ingredient of English resilience and character. He speaks with pride and affection of the fact “the working man’s heart does not leap when he sees a union jack”, that “the patriotism of the common people is not vocal or even conscious”, and that England is above all a compromise, “a strange mixture of reality and illusion, democracy and privilege, humbug and decency”. Neville is groping for something similar, the fact the best kind of freedom is the freedom not to give two hoots about a square of fabric, or browbeating notions of patriotism. Pointedly, Orwell also preaches vigilance, the need to let your heritage grow and change, that England “has to be true to herself”, and that “she is not being true to herself while the refugees who have come to our shores are penned up in concentration camps”. Famously Orwell also hated sport because of its weaponising of nationalism, its glorification of physical victory, and has been proved right in this now more than ever before. England football didn’t traditionally have flags in it right through to the 1980s, when they would occasionally appear daubed with National Front slogans. Right now the last two hosts of the men’s World Cup, and also the next one, are involved in a bloody conflict of some kind. Orwell was half right. Sport is now war plus the shooting. There are two last things worth saying. Neville may be correct in his sense of a more nuanced idea of traditional English patriotism. But he is also out of time. The hive mind, shout-politics, algorithm life have trampled over lots of things. The idea that the best kind of Englishness can stay separate from this seems out of date. Britain itself is more than ever like a strange, small, damp archipelago marooned at the jumping-off point between the continents. On the other hand, it doesn’t mean this is fixed either. In Catch-22, The Great Loyalty Oath Crusade comes to an end when the largely silent Major de Coverley walks into the mess hall, scowls at the absurdity of flag-hugging and anthem-singing, and says three words: “Give Everybody Eat.” At which point the whole thing evaporates in its own absurdity. Someone has to say something, and keep saying it, however garbled or easily shot down. Neville may not be our George Orwell.

38da73adf090,"West Ham tumble in modern football’s global vortex, with home now a distant memory",,"G raham Potter still turned up for work on Saturday morning, even though there was no work left for him to do. A team meeting was arranged, at which Potter announced to general bewilderment that he had been sacked. Potter left. Training was delayed because nobody was available to take it. Eventually the new coach, Nuno Espírito Santo, arrived on site and hastily began preparations for the Everton game on Monday. Perhaps on reflection it was inevitable that West Ham United’s big set-piece appointment went the same way many of their set pieces have gone this season. “We’re not West Ham any more,” disgruntled fans have been chanting at recent protests against the club’s ownership, but consider the evidence. A bungled sacking. A fiesta of contradictory leaks and briefings. Chaotic performances on the pitch. A vacuum of leadership and direction. Catastrophic recruitment. An early relegation battle. Fans in open revolt. I don’t know. Sounds pretty West Ham to me. In many ways Nuno is the perfect manager for the current shambles, which is not entirely a compliment. Nuno will sort out the leaky defence, inject some energy in midfield, get the team running as a unit, put some points on the board, turn a diplomatic cheek to the foibles around him and extravagances above him. He will not become a face‑swap meme. He will not go on Monday Night Football to point at a large television and explain what a genius he is. But what he will also not do is provide any wider sense of mission and purpose, offer any broader footballing vision beyond the creation of numerical overloads, give this restless and desperately sick club any clearer idea of its place in the world. The protests may subside. There may even be some decent, stirring football and a tilt at Europe some day. But West Ham have had these things in the past and it has not brought them peace, because what they lack is ultimately something far deeper and more existential.

Place, people, history, memories, symbols, songs. On raw materials alone, West Ham should be one of the easiest sells in English football: an east London institution attracting 62,000 a week, the eighth-longest serving club in the Premier League. In a league run by opaque funds and investment instruments, it is one of the very few in local ownership. David Sullivan grew up in Hornchurch and his late co‑owner, David Gold, lived on Green Street. There is a culture and authenticity, a community and a global brand, and plenty of cash to burn. How do you get this so wrong? Perhaps the enduring paradox of West Ham is that while it has always been a club in London, it has never truly been a London club. More correctly it is an East End club, a part of town with its own character and outlook, its own rituals and vernacular, the grizzled pride that comes with being outsiders in your own city. Not tourist London, not establishment London, but a kind of walled fortress where everyone held tight, where everyone knew who they were because – importantly – everyone knew where they were. The London Stadium was conceived as a world-class athletics venue and perhaps the kindest thing you can say about it today is that it remains a world-class athletics venue. The shallow rake efficiently disperses the noise up the back straight; the high distant seats offer a magnificent view of the javelin competition. There is a nice canal alongside and as much boutique street food as you can eat. But a walled fortress it is not, and can never be. And frankly it is the most visible symptom, if not the underlying cause, of modern West Ham. Swathes of empty seats at the London Stadium before the end of West Ham’s defeat by Tottenham in September. Photograph: Yui Mok/PA The stadium has secured the future of West Ham, but at the expense of its present. And put yourself in Sullivan’s and Gold’s shoes for a moment. You took over a club nursing nine-figure debts, competing in a rapidly overheating league populated by billionaires and nation-states. You are not men of football but men of numbers, and in this landscape all your principles are secondary to the first: you must not, under any circumstances, get relegated next May. Everything flows from this survival instinct. This is why West Ham have a squad full of short-term fixes, assembled with no real vision or coherent idea. £40m for Max Kilman, £27m for Nicklas Füllkrug … £7m to take Kalvin Phillips on loan. This is why, of the 86 players signed for a fee since the takeover, only three – Dimitri Payet, Flynn Downes and Mohammed Kudus – have turned a significant profit. This is also, by the way, how you end up hiring a head of recruitment in January and most likely sacking him before the year is out. skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Football Daily Kick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of football Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The potential is out there. Ezri Konsa played at Senrab up the road. Rio Ngumoha learned his football in the five-a-side cages of Newham. Ayden Heaven was in the West Ham academy until the age of 13. The under-18s won the Youth Cup a couple of years ago, and most of them are still at the club. But for reasons of opportunity or circumstance, quicker movers or richer predators, this is no longer a place where you can envisage local talent flourishing. The money is clearly there, too. Premier League revenue, European revenue, the Declan Rice fee , sell‑outs every week, the removal of many concessionary ticket categories: why is there so little evidence of West Ham’s richness where it matters? Perhaps this explains the sense of bitterness between the fans and the boardroom: the sheer scale of waste, the pure disconnect between a fanbase feeling increasingly poor and an ownership throwing bad money after bad, between a fanbase invested for life and a board that can barely see beyond the weekend. Meanwhile your owner has become increasingly elusive and your vice-chair has a weekly column in the Sun explaining why you all just need to chill out, actually. And on some level the tale of West Ham is a parable for something larger than West Ham, something larger even than football. The feeling of loss and dislocation, communities broken up and parcelled off, the total absence of control and agency, the suspicion that your toil and your tears are making somebody else rich. And few places have endured this process as swiftly or violently as east London: a community essentially uprooted from itself, stripped and gentrified, flooded with investment that somehow always seems to be flowing somewhere else.

Ken’s Café on Green Street is now something called Bad Boyz Diner. The old supporters’ club headquarters is now a gym.

a5325f5a529c,"Team Europe and Red Roses use connection to past, present and future to create history",,"M aking history is such an overused phrase in sport. There’s a danger we start to believe it’s easy, expected, nothing special. Or that it just happens by magic in an instant on a golf green or a rugby pitch. We envisage “Henry V speeches” on the eve of battle urging players to make their mark on history moments before stepping into the arena. But at the weekend, two of the finest sports teams in the world demonstrated how months and years of intentional, deep culture-building are necessary to create a team identity to underpin the highest levels of performance. Although at starkly different ends of the commercial sports world, both the European Ryder Cup team and the England women’s rugby team deliberately cultivated a shared sense of what it meant for each team to create history together. Europe knew they had to defy the odds to win away for the first time since 2012 , while the Red Roses hadn’t won the World Cup since 2014, losing in the previous two finals. So what did these teams draw on to ensure they could bring their best game in those make or break moments? Performing under pressure at that level is not about training harder or putting the game‑face on. It’s not enough to be fuelled purely by individual, extrinsic drivers “to be the best”. That’s always there within an athlete’s psyche, but when you need to dig really deep – whether it’s facing a hostile environment at Bethpage Black, or Canada scoring first against you in the World Cup final at Twickenham’s Allianz Stadium. You need deep-rooted foundations to ground you, to hold your nerve and find your best performance, and to develop the instincts that help a team to achieve more together than they could alone. Rather than feel negatively pressured or weighed down by history as we have seen in the past, these athletes, captains, vice-captains and coaches respected, researched and embraced the history of their sports. They understood how the past, present and future would connect when they took to the field of play. And then they used this understanding to make sense of their unique responsibility to write the next chapter together, finding joy in the opportunity and privilege to do so. Behind the scenes in the Europe locker room, “This is our time, this is our place” was emblazoned on the wall, accompanied by names, jerseys and stories of those who had made their mark, focusing on the European Ryder Cup teams that had beaten the odds to win in the US. The dates of the four previous wins were written on the walls: 1987, 1995, 2004 and 2012 with the four shirts of those winning away teams hanging up. This wasn’t just about words, it was about jerseys worn and sweated in by their predecessors. Their shared challenge was to add one more shirt to the rail. A similarly profound history swirled around the Red Roses. The Trail of Roses installation at the London Eye celebrated every woman who had pulled on an England shirt, the pioneers and trailblazers on whose shoulders the current team knew they stood. This was a moment to show how far the women’s game had come since the first World Cup in 1991 and point to the immense future potential. Echoing the New Zealand All Blacks rugby team philosophy of taking care of the jersey before passing it on in better shape to the next player, these supremely talented golfers and rugby players drew on this sense of lineage to reach out and connect with their audiences. All the while, they gained perspective, meaning and humility for themselves, qualities that are key components of human resilience. Former players (from left) Maxine Edwards, Janis Ross, Karen Almond, Emma Mitchell at the Trail of Roses, an installation featuring 267 giant red roses to represent every England women’s rugby player. Photograph: Stripe Both teams set their ambitions far beyond winning. Luke Donald, the European captain, reaffirmed that they weren’t just playing to win, they were playing for each other, for all those who dreamed of playing for Europe in the future, for something far greater than themselves. Continuing to draw on the work with the performance coach Owen Eastwood that shaped his captaincy and team-building skills two years ago in Rome, Donald commissioned a moving video that featured many of the 37 European men who had won an away Ryder Cup, including current members of the team and himself – a powerful reinforcement of their overarching mission. Donald knew he needed to invest in both the data and the culture, the quantitative and the qualitative. One vice-captain, Edoardo Molinari, crunched the stats to inform pairings while another, José María Olazábal, captain from the last Europe team to win on foreign soil, brought past inspiration. Donald spent time listening to the players, figuring out how to prepare and set them up to thrive and play their best game at Bethpage Black: creating a shared purpose, connecting them to each other and then giving them autonomy to lead themselves once on the course. New Zealander John Mitchell, the Red Roses’ head coach, similarly prioritised culture-building since joining in 2023. The Red Roses emulated one of the core team strengths of England’s women footballers by ensuring the team spirit for those among the replacements felt as strong as those on the pitch. They also shared the Lionesses’ ambition to create a lasting positive impact after the tournament through inspiring younger girls watching, the upcoming generation of players, as well as global rugby leaders to see the future potential of the sport. Both of these glorious sports teams have shown us that the true value of their sporting success lies in the depth of connection to their predecessors, those watching now and future generations to come. Developing a deep and deliberate historical consciousness is becoming a core part of how modern elite sports teams build resilient cultures to take their performance to the next level.",https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/oct/01/team-europe-red-roses-use-connection-past-present-future-history-together-womens-rugby-union-ryder-cup-golf,Sport,BBC,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8eb5d76fc05d341c5c22977c61400072f17c1cf0/0_0_5000_4000/master/5000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=f56d7e2ca51ad36d3015f7b5ca31f6a9",2025-10-01T07:00:06+00:00,0d5679609157ed4b62ebc056c9226d7d53a4e17f
dd18792ad22d,Curtain up for epic rugby tale Exe Men: the best south-west drama since Poldark,,"L adies and gentlemen, it’s almost time to take your seats. The most compelling West Country drama since Poldark? Friday Night Lights with pasties? Or, if you like, a little dash of Scrumpy & Western? Never let it be said we lack creative enthusiasm out here in the sticks, nor the desire to offer local theatregoers something refreshingly different. Welcome, either way, to the world’s most improbable new stage play. How else to summarise a production about the rise of an unflashy Devon rugby club, based on the book Exe Men by – there’s no easy way to say this – yours truly. Trust me, watching professional actors rehearse scenes that started life on your own keyboard is a surreal experience. Fortunately Exe Men the play – which opens next week – has been written by someone with significantly better credentials. Remember the BBC’s brilliant Life on Mars and Ashes to Ashes? Detective Gene Hunt firing up the Quattro ? The show’s co-creator Ashley Pharoah has specialised in TV screenwriting but also loves his rugby and was instantly intrigued when Martin Berry, creative director at Exeter’s Northcott Theatre , approached him. It was brave of them because rugby – with wonderful exceptions such as Up ’n’ Under, Stand Up And Fight, and Grav – can be a tricky theatrical theme. How do you improve, dramatically speaking, on Exeter going from lower-league anonymity to the champions of Europe in little over a decade? Particularly if everyone knows the ending? Or if some people watching don’t really like sport? The aim, accordingly, has been to highlight the characters who made it happen and the intense regional pride they aroused. And how each can shape the other. Ashley, Martin and myself also share the same conviction: that the south-west deserves a higher national profile. Actor Tim Hudson (left) and the man he plays, Tony Rowe, chair of Exeter Chiefs, during rehearsals for the play Exe Men. Photograph: Samuel Simpson-Pattison/Rugby Journal “When was the last time you heard a national newsreader with a West Country accent?” asks Berry rhetorically. If the peninsula does make the news it’s usually because something unpleasant has washed up on a beach or the weather has scared the tourists away. The lack of Premier League football south-west of Bristol has traditionally been another factor. Which is why it caused a stir when the Chiefs were promoted to English rugby’s top division in 2010. Devon has produced plenty of yachtsmen, swimmers and the occasional Tom Daley but, aside from a few FA Cup victories for Plymouth Argyle , not much sustained team sporting success. Little did anyone guess that, by October 2020, the Chiefs would be claiming a domestic and European trophy double – a feat that even Pharoah, as a Bath fan, found extraordinary. “To go from sidestepping dog poo in a public park to winning the European Cup is amazing. It’s a bigger story, in some ways, than Leicester winning the Premier League when you think of where they came from.” The book sought to tell that epic tale through its central pillars. Men such as Rob Baxter who, along with his brother Richie, followed their farmer father John into the “other” family enterprise at the muddy old County Ground. Or the club’s chair, Tony Rowe, whose business nous helped to rescue the club financially. Or Gareth Steenson, the fly‑half previously rejected by his native Ulster. “We were all told we weren’t good enough somewhere else,” Steenson says. “The strength of the group at the start was that we were from all over the place so we got to know each other’s families.” Exeter Chiefs lift the trophy after claiming the European Champions Cup in 2020. Photograph: Andrew Boyers/Action Images/Reuters While slightly disappointed that Jamie Dornan will not be portraying him – “He would have been perfect” – “Steeno” is now looking forward to seeing how the Chiefs’ once lively post-match “rehydration” sessions are depicted. “Sitting on the bus home for three hours gave us time to socialise. I could barely tell you what happened in a lot of games but what I remember most are the social times. I remember we got our first losing bonus point away from home, at Northampton, and celebrating like we’d won with a bonus point.” All the above, plus the chocolate muffin‑loving Kiwi Thomas Waldrom, England’s Jack Nowell and Henry Slade, and Ireland’s Ian Whitten are played engagingly by six professional actors and a 31‑strong community ensemble. skip past newsletter promotion The latest rugby union news and analysis, plus all the week's action reviewed Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

There’s actually a lot you can do to take the audience with you. If we just ask them to sit and watch some footage then we’ve cocked it up.” Cometh the hour, then, for Robert Shaw Cameron, who plays the club’s big chief, Rob Baxter. The former was the dentist Laurence Reeves in Coronation Street but now has a role into which he can properly sink his teeth. “It’s the first time I’ve played a ‘real’ person and you do feel a deep responsibility. There’s a public version of Rob and Tony but there’s a private version as well. The challenge was accessing that private bit. I wanted to explore what people don’t see. When I asked Rob whether he has a confidant he talked about his wife, Jo. That’s something we’ve worked hard to reflect.” Pharoah has also sought to tease out the human emotions of other pivotal individuals. “It’s about sport but it’s not really. It’s about people and dreams.” And, when you dig slightly deeper, about male fellowship, too. “One of the elements is that men aren’t completely crap and can achieve things. I really like that about it. It’s a play about maleness which isn’t necessarily the most fashionable thing to write about at the moment, is it?” A few of those portrayed may not instantly recognise themselves but in Rowe’s case it is very much the opposite. Tim Hudson, the actor playing him, arguably looks more like Rowe than the chair does himself. “It is quite strange,” says Rowe, now 77 but still bound for South America this week to drive a rally car through Brazil and Guyana. “When the people who know me see him they’ll say: ‘There’s Tony.’” So brace yourselves. The south‑west – and rugby – is about to enjoy a rare stage closeup. As Cameron puts it: “In this golden age of telly and Netflix, this is what theatre can still do better than anything else: tell stories that resonate with people and speak to their community.” Will anyone “do an Exeter” again? Probably not.

3d6dd8f84426,Jos Buttler: ‘A big burden has been lifted – I wasn’t the same leader after the 2023 World Cup’,,"A nother summer is over and, for Jos Buttler, life and cricket feel more precious than ever. The fleeting nature of both has been accentuated by the loss of Buttler’s father, John, after his unexpected death in August. The 35-year-old will soon talk movingly about grief and acceptance but, first, he reflects on his venerable place in white-ball cricket after England’s international summer ended in a low-key series in Ireland . Buttler opened the batting and Jacob Bethell and Rehan Ahmed, who followed him at three and four in the opening match, are both 21. But he had proved his sustained brilliance a few weeks earlier when, against South Africa, he hit 83 off 30 balls in a blistering knock that helped England to become the first team to pass 300 in a T20 international . “They were affectionately calling me Grandpa,” Buttler says of his teammates in Ireland. “It was just me and [the 37-year-old] Adil Rashid as the older crew but it’s still great even if sometimes I’m thinking: ‘God, how lucky you guys are to have all this ahead of you.’ But I’ve made a conscious effort to try not to think about my age. I’m going to play cricket like this as long as I can and just enjoy it.” We’re in a London studio, soon after Buttler and Stuart Broad finished recording this week’s episode of their successful For the Love of Cricket podcast . I’m in the chair where Rob Key, the managing director of the England cricket team, had sat while Broad and Buttler interviewed him. But Buttler slips seamlessly into the role of interviewee as he talks honestly about his emotions. Jos Buttler looks to the skies after reaching 50 against South Africa at Old Trafford this month. Photograph: George Franks/ProSports/Shutterstock “I got out for a duck in my last innings [in Dublin] and I was absolutely gutted,” he says. “But as long as I’m getting annoyed when I don’t do well, I’ve still got that edge.” Does he still have “fuck it” written on the top of his bat handle? “I do. At the non-striker’s end I look at it as it’s a nice reminder about what matters to me.” On his podcast Buttler spoke about how this year he had dug out his old notebooks where he used to write down his cricketing thoughts. “In the last six months I’ve stopped doing that. As a [white‑ball] captain I had some good days and a few more bad days and I was especially knocked after the 50-over World Cup in India [when England were hapless in 2023 ]. I took those old books to India to the IPL [in March] and read through them. I found very similar themes throughout the last 10 years. Every time I play, I find myself looking at the sky and imagining him looking down Jos Buttler on his father If I was playing great I was writing the same thing – just like when I was playing badly. “It made me think I’ve got to stop trying so hard. I had a great IPL, played as well as I’ve ever played, and I was like: ‘Wow, I can play well without writing my notes, without saying I need to do X, Y, Z.’” Buttler takes another mouthful of sushi and chews thoughtfully. “It all comes full circle and, in the latter part of my career, I want to enjoy it and not hang on to things as hard as I may have done.” A brutal test of this philosophy came less than two months ago when his dad died. “It happened during the Hundred and it was quite raw. He hadn’t been well for a while but it was still a shock when he passed away. It’s given me a new appreciation of cricket and I’ve actually found a lot of determination to do my best because that was all he ever wanted me to do. Now, every time I play I find myself looking at the sky quite a lot and imagine him watching down.” Buttler’s voice is steady but his face is creased in pain. “It’s been a tough time but it’s given me a deeper appreciation for how much he and my mum did for me. I still really want to win and you feel disappointed when you don’t do well. But it’s not the be-all and end‑all as the loss of a parent really gives that perspective.” Jos Buttler says he has taken recent inspiration from Joe Root. Photograph: David Levene/The Guardian Thinking about grief he says: “A few people who have been through the same experience said: ‘Don’t judge yourself for how you feel. There’re times when you feel happy and you’re having a good time. Don’t think you shouldn’t because your dad passed away four weeks ago.’ It’s also OK to feel sad. Don’t just ignore it, you’ve got to try to deal with it. So I’m taking it slow and we’ll see how it goes.” He must have thought about his dad when England set their world‑record T20 score of 304 for two, five weeks after his death? “Yes,” Buttler says quietly. “My dad would have absolutely loved that match. He’d have been glued to the TV. He was a very nervous watcher, in the latter years, but he’d have recorded it and replayed it the next day.” Did he sense early on that he and fellow opener Phil Salt had set the foundation for an extraordinary world record? “More so when I got out. I remember seeing the graphic where we were on 166 after 10 overs. I’d been asked in India who’ll be the first team to score 300 in the IPL. I said: ‘I don’t think anyone will do it.’ But then it dawned on me that we could.” Buttler shakes his head in amazement. “After the game you’re sat in your team clothes and don’t want to take them off. You just want to savour the highlights and everyone talking about what a day it was. When you’ve played for a long time you know it doesn’t happen every day. So take it in.” skip past newsletter promotion Subscribe to our cricket newsletter for our writers' thoughts on the biggest stories and a review of the week’s action Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He’s got a great way of talking to the group. He doesn’t get too high or too low but he was so proud and said: ‘Look what’s possible with the talent you guys have got.” That simple joy contrasts with the anguish that Buttler sometimes experienced as England’s white‑ball captain – despite leading them to victory in the T20 World Cup in 2022. “I’m getting more and more clarity and acceptance on that time. Some people said I was a certain way and I would have ego and say: ‘No, I’m not upset. I’m not angry.’ Now, without the mask on, I can say: ‘Maybe I was upset.’ I lost a bit of self‑awareness because the 2023 World Cup in India was a huge confidence knock. I probably never recovered from that as a leader and never had the same conviction again.” Harry Brook replaced him as captain this summer and, for Buttler, “a big burden’s been lifted. Even when I went home I took this dark cloud. That, absolutely, has been lifted.” Jos Buttler begins the England celebrations after running out New Zealand’s Martin Guptill off the last ball of the super over to win the World Cup in 2019. Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The Guardian Joe Root struggled as England’s Test captain but, since relinquishing the role, his batting has reached supreme levels. “Definitely,” Buttler says of his close friend. “During my first game, not being captain, Joe was in the side which really helped. I kept wicket, he was at slip and I said: ‘God, it’s a bit weird, isn’t it, when you’re not captain any more?’ Joe said it’s normal to feel like this. He said when people talk in the dressing room in a positive way, sometimes it makes you feel like they’re talking negatively about your captaincy. You have to realise that’s not the case. Seeing how much he’s enjoying cricket, and playing so well, gives me lots of comfort you can have a great time post-captaincy.” After a brief white‑ball tour of New Zealand this month, Buttler will have a six-week break before playing franchise cricket in South Africa. But he will be consumed by watching the Ashes. “The Ashes are strange for me because, obviously, it’s the best series but my own performances were really poor. I’ve got fond memories of watching other players do well, and being in teams that won in 2015 and drew in 2019 when Australia retained the urn. It’s more intense than anything else in cricket and, in 2015, I completely overbuilt it. I made it such a big thing and asked so many people: ‘Why is it so hard? What do I need to do?’ It was a good lesson because I spoke to way too many people and was paralysed by all that information.” Jos Buttler reacts after losing his wicket in the 2023 World Cup defeat to Sri Lanka. Photograph: Andrew Boyers/Reuters Buttler played four Tests in Australia in 2021-22, England losing the first three badly and clinging on for a draw in Sydney. “It was a tough time. My last-ever Test was in Sydney, where I broke my finger. I think my head was on the chopping block anyway and we were just outplayed. But this very different England team is now in a really good place.” Buttler smiles when I ask him for an Ashes prediction. “England to win 3-2 in an absolute classic. I think we’ve got an amazing chance with such a settled team. Everything’s coming into place at the right time.” Buttler’s and Broad’s podcast should reach fresh heights during a compelling series. They’ve already developed a relaxed rapport while conducting fascinating in-depth interviews with people as different as McCullum and Justin Langer. “I’ve learned how much I love talking about cricket,” Buttler says. “It’s obviously a big part of everything that we do, and it’s shaped everything, but getting the chance to talk in detail with Broady has been so enjoyable. And it’s been great learning new skills without it affecting my cricket.” The T20 and 50-over World Cups both take place next year. It’s telling that, after all his reflections on life and loss, Buttler is clear when he outlines his remaining ambitions in cricket: “I want to win something again, especially with England in another World Cup. To experience that winning dressing room again would be special. “I’ll never forget what it was like lifting that trophy in 2022 with your team all around you. That probably got tainted by the next few years. But when we won the [50-over] World Cup in 2019 it was never tainted. It would be good to have that feeling again.”",https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/sep/30/jos-buttler-world-cup-england-ashes-cricket-captaincy,Sport,BBC,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/47c1f3647ab8441e5a89d753b1307216487b020d/0_2068_5460_4369/master/5460.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=fba6827ec9ccf5c1bb8646f26c5b1013",2025-09-30T18:00:49+00:00,8bc349433d5f351dee5c153bb455b0b5c01362e4
96eb27214170,I rewatched the Thrilla in Manila with Muhammad Ali. He still winced at the blows years later,,"In 1989, with Muhammad Ali sitting beside me, I watched a tape of Ali’s historic triumph over Joe Frazier in Manila, which took place 50 years ago this week. For months, Ali and I had been reviewing his fights for a book I was writing as his authorized biographer. We’d watched Henry Cooper knock Cassius Clay to the brink of oblivion with a picture-perfect left hook. From the vantage point of my living room, that had amused Muhammad. We’d seen Joe Frazier put Ali on the canvas in Round 15 of their first encounter at Madison Square Garden , and Ken Norton break Muhammad’s jaw . Those punches were safely ensconced in the annals of history, as were the thudding blows that George Foreman landed in Zaire . Watching Ali-Frazier III, known widely as the Thrilla in Manila, was a different experience . Despite the fact that it was one of Muhammad’s greatest ring triumphs, there was no joy in his face as The Thrilla in Manila unfolded. Sitting beside me, he winced as some of Frazier’s blows landed. He seemed to be reexperiencing the pain. When the tape ended, he turned to me and said, “Frazier quit just before I did. I didn’t think I could fight anymore.” Fifty years have passed since Ali and Frazier did battle in the sweltering heat and humidity of that late-morning hour in one of the most celebrated, brutal prizefights of all time. “What it came down to wasn’t the heavyweight championship of the world,” Jerry Izenberg, a leading sports writer of that era, later noted. “Ali and Frazier were fighting for something more important than that. They were fighting for the championship of each other. I’ve never witnessed anything like it. Both fighters won that night, and both fighters lost.” Neither man ever fully recovered from the physical damage that they inflicted on each other that day. Let’s put what many consider the greatest prizefight ever in context. Ali in 1975 was the most famous, and possibly the most loved, person in the world. The hatred that had been directed at him for his views on race and his refusal to accept induction into the United States Army at the height of the war in Vietnam had largely abated. His 1974 knockout of Foreman in Zaire to reclaim the heavyweight throne had engendered worldwide joy. Frazier didn’t share those good feelings. On 8 March 1971, in their first meeting, Frazier had defeated Ali in “The Fight of the Century” at Madison Square Garden to earn the undisputed heavyweight championship of the world. But the victory had come with a heavy price-tag. The first Ali-Frazier fight was seen in the United States as a metaphor for the struggle between racist warlike elements (who embraced Frazier as the anti-Ali) on one side and those seeking peace and social justice (largely Ali partisans) on the other. Frazier didn’t want to be a symbol. He was uninterested in politics and rarely talked about religion or race. He’d grown up as a sharecropper’s son in the meanest circumstances that rural America had to offer. All he wanted to do was fight. “Clay got into boxing when he was 12 years old because his bike was stolen,” Frazier said. “I didn’t have no bike when I was 12. I was working in the fields.” But the popular narrative framed Ali as an outsider and Joe as a representative of America’s white establishment. And Ali perpetuated that myth, attacking Frazier’s blackness and character. He demeaned Joe as an “Uncle Tom” and stripped him of his dignity in the public mind. “Joe was almost the stereotypic black person Ali claimed to be fighting for,” writer Dave Wolf, who was later a member of Frazier’s entourage, observed. “Yet Ali demeaned Joe at every turn. Look at the perception many people have that Joe is stupid because he’s not facile with the language and because his particular brand of South Carolina English isn’t easily understood by people who don’t come from that part of South Carolina. Joe is not dumb. But Ali stuck that saddle on him, and Joe will have to wear it forever. Joe is not, and never was, an Uncle Tom, whatever that means. But Ali branded him with that label too. The damage he did to Joe was never undone.” Frazier wanted to be a hero. After beating Ali, he received condescending approval from much of white America. But he was never a hero where it mattered most to him – to his own people. Three years later in the build-up to Ali-Frazier II, which Ali won by decision, Muhammad branded Joe as “ignorant.” In Manila, he labeled him a “gorilla.” Just as his ring battles against Ali defined Frazier as a fighter, Joe’s relationship with Muhammad defined him, unfairly, in the eyes of the world. “I do all the right things.” Frazier lamented. “And this is the way people look at me because of him.” Later, he would add to that sentiment, saying, “I know things would of been different for me if Clay hadn’t of been around. I’d of gotten a lot more respect. I’d of had more appreciation from my own kind.” Unlike Ali-Frazier I, Manila wasn’t about Ali’s social and political beliefs. The narrative had quieted by then. In some ways, Ali had come to represent the status quo and establishment while Joe had been tossed aside. But for both men – and particularly for Joe – Ali-Frazier III was intensely personal. Frazier’s hatred toward Ali had grown to enormous proportions. Manila was his last opportunity to regain the dignity that he felt Muhammad had stolen from him. Ali was a great artist in the ring, as the world saw against opponents like Cleveland Williams and Zora Folley. But his greatest moments in boxing came when he had inquisitors like Sonny Liston and Foreman in front of him. Frazier was Ali’s greatest inquisitor. Joe enjoyed fighting. No one ever enjoyed fighting Joe. “Frazier never took a backward step inside the ring,” Don Turner, who later trained Larry Holmes and Evander Holyfield, observed. “Not for no one. He didn’t come to dance. He didn’t come to hold. He didn’t come to box. He came to fight.” Frazier echoed that theme, saying of Ali, “He ain’t no fighter. He’s a boxer. I’m a fighter.” But in Manila, Ali showed beyond all doubt that he was a fighter too. Associated Press boxing writer Ed Schuyler later recalled: “The Thrilla in Manila was the best fight I’ve ever seen. As it unfolded, everybody at ringside understood they were watching greatness. The pace never eased. It was hell the whole way. I’ve never seen two people give more, ever.” The early rounds belonged to Ali. He outboxed Frazier, landed sharp clean punches, and staggered his opponent several times. Frazier kept coming forward. The tide turned in the middle rounds. Ali was tiring. Frazier rocked him with thunderous blows. Muhammad’s arms came down as Frazier bludgeoned him against the ropes, pounding away. Ali regained the initiative in round 12, wobbled Frazier, and measured him for more. One round later, a jolting left hook knocked Frazier’s mouthpiece into the crowd. He was shaken but finished the round. In round 14, Ali resumed his assault. “The 14th round,” Richard Hoffer later wrote, “the final three minutes of their shared agony, was a kind of scientific experiment, an investigation into the extremes of human behavior. Just exactly what was a person capable of? How far could he go? How deep could he reach? Nobody had ever seen it conducted at this level. Nobody really knew what desire and pride could accomplish, or destroy. Now they did.” Frazier’s left eye was completely closed. The vision in his right eye was limited. He was spitting blood. Ali’s punches were landing cleanly. Frazier couldn’t see them coming. Both fighters had landed so many clean blows that the padding inside their gloves was separating. More and more, it was like hitting and being hit with ungloved fists. Frazier’s trainer, Eddie Futch, stopped the carnage after the 14th round. Muhammad Ali and Joe Frazier during the buildup to the Thrilla in Manila. Photograph: Jess Tan/AP Frazier is now thought of in some circles primarily as a piece of the Ali legend. But that notion is unfair. He was far more. It’s true that, without the three Ali-Frazier fights, Joe’s career would be lacking in historical gravitas. But those three fights did happen. Frazier won Ali-Frazier I and came very close to victory in Ali-Frazier III. Did some of Ali’s greatness rub off on him? Absolutely. But some of Frazier’s greatness rubbed off on Ali too. Joe deserves to be remembered in his own right. In their later years, Ali and Frazier interacted occasionally, almost always for an economic incentive. But Joe’s hatred toward Muhammad remained. He took pleasure in believing that the punishment he inflicted on Ali in Manila contributed to the physical difficulties that Muhammad endured late in life. “He shook me in Manila,” Frazier acknowledged “He won. But I sent him home worse than he came. Look at him now. He’s damaged goods. I know it. You know it. Everyone knows it. They just don’t want to say. He was always making fun of me. I’m the dummy; I’m the one getting hit in the head. Tell me now; him or me; which one talks worse now? Manila really don’t matter no more. He’s finished, and I’m still here.” Later, adding to the ugliness of that sentiment, Frazier declared “I’ll outlive him. I’ll dance on his grave.” It wasn’t to be. Frazier died in 2011 at the age of 67 . Five years later, Ali died aged 74 . They weren’t old by ordinary standards. But Muhammad’s health was in ruins during the final decade of his life. Frazier was foremost among the fighters whose blows permanently damaged him physically. And Ali permanently damaged Frazier, both physically and psychologically. In Manila, they had a glimpse of the future and what would become of them. It saddens me that Frazier carried all of that anger and hate inside him. It cast a shadow on his life. But I’ll give the final word to Ali who, decades ago, told me. “I don’t think two big men ever fought fights like me and Joe Frazier . One fight, maybe. But three times; we were the only ones. Of all the men I fought in boxing, Sonny Liston was the scariest. Foreman was the most powerful. Floyd Patterson was the most skilled as a boxer. But the roughest and toughest was Joe Frazier. He brought out the best in me, and the best fight we fought was in Manila. That fight, I could feel something happening to me. Something different from what I’d felt in fights before. And God blessed me that day. He’s blessed me many times, and that fight in Manila was one of them. It was like I took myself as far as I could go, and then God took me the rest of the way. “So I’m sorry Joe Frazier is mad at me. I’m sorry I hurt him. Joe Frazier is a good man. I couldn’t have done what I did without him, and he couldn’t have done what he did without me. And if God ever calls me to a holy war, I want Joe Frazier fighting beside me.”",https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/sep/30/thrilla-in-manila-ali-frazier-boxing,Sport,BBC,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2394a81b2b9a86fbe9d99ced938afeb389a9cef4/389_260_2286_1830/master/2286.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=4f43f7f5dcfbbe53be663970b1243e20",2025-09-30T08:30:53+00:00,4bacac2e70d07dac424b46ea5112c4628457ba03

Well, that was a significant half-point on day three … No, seriously, the award belongs to Tommy Fleetwood. Singles defeat should not mask his overall performance. Surely a major winner in waiting. Rookie of the tournament Cameron Young edges out JJ Spaun for his tenacity in seeing off Justin Rose on Sunday. This set the tone for an almighty US run at the Ryder Cup . The greatest comeback was on. Best celebration Few things in 2025’s year of sport will beat Shane Lowry’s crying, dancing, screaming combination when the Ryder Cup had at least been retained. What a moment for the Irishman. Best match Rory McIlroy’s and Lowry’s halved fourball clash with Sam Burns and Patrick Cantlay on Friday afternoon. Utterly gripping to the very last putts. Funniest moment Bryson DeChambeau exiting stage left after man-mountain Ian Finnis, Fleetwood’s caddie, stepped forward to protect his man during a Saturday afternoon war of words. One battle DeChambeau smartly thought better of. In 2027 Europe will … ensure the US team have rose petals thrown at their feet in Ireland. Kill them with kindness. It would be the sensible antidote to the moronic Bethpage backdrop. The Ryder Cup does not have to be this way.

Photograph: Michael Reaves/PGA of America/Getty Images Andy Bull Player of the tournament Other people played more games, made more putts and won more points, but the truth is that Europe would have lost this cup if it hadn’t been for the way Shane Lowry played in the big moments on Saturday and Sunday. Rookie of the tournament Cameron Young. He carried the US team through the first two days, when he won two of their four-and-a-half points, then led them out in the Sunday singles by beating Justin Rose in a match that went all the way to the 18th. Best celebration Not sure if it counts as best or not but Lowry certainly has the scariest. There were times during his Saturday fourball when you couldn’t tell if he was celebrating another good putt or wading in to settle a bar fight. Best match Rose’s and Fleetwood’s Saturday fourball against Scottie Scheffler and DeChambeau had just about everything, including more birdies than a quarrel of sparrows, and a stramash between the caddies. Funniest moment MC Heather McMahan being booed into awkward silence when she tried to lead the crowd at the 1st tee into a new chant which involved singing Scottie Scheffler’s name to the tune of We Will Rock You. In 2027 Europe will … likely be a hell of a lot friendlier than New York.

Unbeaten over the first two days amid feral vitriol and hostility. Rookie of the tournament Cameron Young. The debutant playing in his home state gave the US their spark: fearless off the tee, nerveless on the greens, steady when the din rose highest. A 3-1-0 record and the star of the week for his captain, Keegan Bradley. Best celebration Was it Lowry’s Balanchine-flecked frolic after holing from six feet to retain the trophy? Or was it Lowry’s spicy two-word clapback at an unruly spectator after his eagle from 50ft to turn the Saturday fourballs classic blue? Best match McIlroy and Lowry beating Thomas and Young. Golf under siege: extra troopers, shushing opponents, constant needle. Europe landed the heavier putts and walked off to songs, not sirens. Part of the increased police presence that followed the afternoon fourball match featuring Rory McIlroy and Shane Lowry against Justin Thomas and Cameron Young. Photograph: David Davies/PA Funniest moment Watching a gaggle of about two dozen fans draped in Irish flags serenading DeChambeau as he smacked balls on the practice range on Saturday night more than an hour after the close of play. In 2027 USA will … swear lessons were learned, then rediscover the same flaw: individuals first, team second. The culture rewards brands, not bonds; pairings fray and Europe feast again. Scott Murray Player of the tournament It’s impossible not to love Tommy Fleetwood. Four points out of five, and a smiling beacon of goodwill amid intense provocation. He even managed to disarm Scottie Scheffler’s caddie with charm, just as the livid looper was about to make a proper fool of himself during that encroachment brouhaha. Europe’s Tommy Fleetwood had plenty of fans cheering him on at Bethpage Black. Photograph: James Marsh/Shutterstock Rookie of the tournament Cameron Young made five birdies in his first 13 holes as a Ryder Cup player, becoming the first American to win his debut match by six holes since Phil Mickelson 30 years ago. Then he held his nerve in the face of Justin Rose’s singles comeback. The real deal from beginning to end. Best celebration A toss-up between two performances diametrically opposed on the supercool spectrum: Rose walking in a big 20-foot swinger at 8 on day two with the ball barely halfway to the hole, and Shane Lowry showcasing his hitherto untapped talent for interpretive dance. Best match JJ Spaun – who ran Young close as best rookie – bested Jon Rahm and Sepp Straka with laser irons into 17 and 18 on Saturday afternoon, spinning victory from defeat with a proper matchplay smash and grab. Top moxie, especially as it avoided a session bluewash. Rahm can console himself with the shot of the tournament, chipping in earlier that day on 8, knee-deep in the bunker, hands down the shaft, Seve in the sky. Funniest moment “Guys, shut the fuck up!” Rory McIlroy, voice dripping with disdain, dealing with some fools. Then swiveling 180 before arrowing an iron from 149 yards to 3ft to win the match. Best not poke the bear. An all-time Ryder Cup moment that will never fail to raise a smile. One of Bryson’s drives landing in a trashcan was too on the nose.

83f4e1eb763f,Ireland seek to pull off ultimate heist in billionaire’s back yard,,"OH IRELAND (PART MLVII) On more than one occasion while speaking to the press on Wednesday, John O’Shea stressed the need for “a more Irish performance” when the international side he helps coach take on Portugal in Lisbon on Saturday. Considering the Republic of Ireland have been utterly hopeless in recent failed campaigns to make major tournaments, and currently sit bottom of their Geopolitics World Cup qualifying group, cynics might say that what is actually required against CR7 and chums is a less Irish performance. But if “Sheasy” thinks slathering the troops with Kerrygold, sending them out on to the pitch waving knobbly sticks and ordering them to Riverdance through the national anthem might help keep the score down, then Football Daily is wholeheartedly in favour of the idea. To be fair to O’Shea, he went on to specify that he and head coach Heimir Hallgrímsson want to see the kind of leadership, unity, resilience and fight that were conspicuous by their absence when their team folded like a deckchair against Armenia in Yerevan last month, even if Ireland’s players might have been better served demonstrating such qualities against a team they were largely expected to beat. One of those defeats that few saw coming but also wasn’t much of a surprise, Ireland’s beating by Armenia was notable for a couple of high-profile and costly errors by a couple of the team’s more experienced Premier League defenders. Putting on a more Irish performance, then, might prove a tall order, given their weird propensity to wilt in the face of the mildest pressure upon being asked to wear a green shirt. O’Shea’s XI? Photograph: Nick Elliott/Inpho/Shutterstock “We all know that we’ve let people down, let ourselves down,” sniffed the Irish midfielder Finn Azaz of that Armenian aberration. “Now it’s just a case of looking towards the next two games to put it right and that’s the feeling right now, there is an anger there to put things right. We know it wasn’t good enough and we’re feeling we can really make a statement and put it right.” While such platitudinous pre-match talk is cheap, anything other than a comfortable Portugal win at the weekend will be a big shock. In the extremely unlikely event that Ireland can do the unthinkable and take a point – or heaven forbid, all three – in Lisbon, it would not so much be a statement as an audacious heist. In Portugal, Ireland will face a team boasting no shortage of superstars, likely to be skippered by the man revealed to have become the sport’s first billionaire player. According to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, Cristiano Ronaldo’s net worth has been estimated at £1.05bn (roughly 47 Evan Fergusons) but despite the relative comfort such a sum would bring him in his dotage, the 40-year-old striker has no plans to retire. “I still have a passion for this,” he tooted at the Portugal Football Globes ceremony. “My family says it’s time to quit, and they ask me why I want to score 1,000 goals if I’ve already scored 900-something. But I don’t think that way inside.” With just 54 goals of the “something” required until he hits his personal millennium milestone and Ireland’s porous and gaffe-prone defence coming to town, it’s small wonder he plans to carry on.

Re: yesterday’s Football Daily letters . I completed a Level 1 FA coaching course in the days of Charles Hughes (there were only three levels back then, kids), and the justification for lumping it down the full-back’s throat from kick-off was that if they were any good at heading the ball then they would be a centre-half. So, at the very least, you would probably win a throw in the opposition’s half. I am amazed that almost all top, top teams persist with this tactic while tippy-tapping the ball around their own penalty area in every other scenario” – John Meara.

As a precaution the night before, my dad took me to the Hawthorns and hammered a series of nine-inch nails into the wall at the away end, forming a ladder of sorts into the ground. We then practiced climbing said ‘ladder’, hopping over the wall and dropping into the urinals on the other side. Nice. Entry assured. Sadly, we got in with tickets, rather spoiling the story.

b39c30752251,Cricket in Corfu causes confusion but also unexpected delight for a few,,"T he boy had been loitering for about 15 minutes, edging steadily closer to the waiting batters seated around the nonexistent boundary edge, when he eventually plucked up the courage to ask who was winning. It was the type of uninformed query that ordinarily prompts eye-rolls in cricket’s complex spheres. But the match situation – 60 for one, chasing a victory target of only 86 – made the response quite simple on this occasion. Besides, he was just a kid; an American one, at that. How was he to know that cricket’s ebbs and flows rarely render it condensable into such binary terms? Buoyed up by the engagement, the child began asking further questions, thrilled by every minor detail he was able to obtain: the ball, the bat, the scoring process. His name, he told us, was Jake. He lived in New York and he was 10 years old. Cricket had been his English father’s favourite sport until dying in a car crash three years ago. Since then, Jake sometimes watches cricket clips on YouTube to try to understand what it is all about. Now, in the unlikeliest of locations, while on holiday with his mother in Corfu, he had stumbled across real-life cricket in the flesh for the first time. His father’s passion played out in front of him. Jake was entranced. His were, in fact, just a few of all manner of inquiries asked by confused spectators over the course of the Sunday afternoon – from English families wondering why they had unexpectedly stumbled across a scene reminiscent of home, to baffled east Asians taking photos of a strange sporting spectacle, the likes of which they had never witnessed before. We were rather difficult to avoid. The match between the tourists, Octopus Cricket Club, and our hosts, Anagennisi Cricket Club, occupied the most prominent of spots in Spianada Square, the green buffer separating the picturesque cobbled Old Town streets from the Old Fortress holding guard over the shimmering Straits of Corfu. Anyone seeking an outdoor spot for some food in the autumnal sun unwittingly became cricket viewers from their vantage point of the dozens of restaurants and cafes that lined one side of the pitch. Spectators – if that is the correct word for an engagement span that ranged from brief glancers to entranced starers – numbered hundreds. Over the past few years, Octopus have embarked on season-ending trips to a raft of unlikely European cricketing locations. From France to Croatia, and Malta to Montenegro, a common denominator tends to be the expat-heavy makeup of the opposition. By contrast, Corfu’s unique cricketing history ensures their teams are overwhelmingly homegrown. A panoramic view of the Venetian quarter in Corfu Town. Photograph: carmengabriela/Getty Images/iStockphoto The first fixture on the Spianada’s sward took place in 1823 between officers of a Royal Navy ship moored nearby and a team of British soldiers from the local garrison. By the end of the 19th century – with the island no longer a British protectorate – the sport had been taken up by natives and Corfu swiftly became the home of Greek cricket. These days, the Hellenic Cricket Federation is based on the island, alongside eight of the country’s 11 clubs (the remainder are located in Athens). Enduring Anglo-Corfiot relations ensure a steady stream of English sides make the trip east to sample the local cricketing fare. One of those was crucial in reinvigorating the sport when it was in danger of dying out on the island – a high-profile fixture between a Corfu XI and a Lord’s Taverners team consisting of celebrities (John Cleese and Nicholas Parsons among them) and former England cricketers (Ken Barrington the most distinguished) in 1978. The match was immortalised in the short film Mad Dogs and Cricketers, narrated by Eric Morecambe, showing the two sides, replete in full whites, arriving at the ground to extraordinary pageantry before taking the field behind a marching band. Our entrance was rather less ceremonious, although pre-match discussions in 2025 differed little from that 47 years earlier, with the Octopus captain, Sam, informed – just as his slightly more illustrious counterpart Barrington had been – that, in lieu of any visible markers, the boundary would begin “where the grass ends”. skip past newsletter promotion Subscribe to our cricket newsletter for our writers' thoughts on the biggest stories and a review of the week’s action Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The tourists gratefully exploited it, easing to a nine-wicket win that made up for our earlier narrow defeat in the tour’s opening fixture at the island’s equally scenic Gouvia Marina ground. As our unbeaten batters walked off the Spianada pitch, and hands were heartily shaken and pictures taken, Jake remained in our midst, absorbing all he could of his father’s treasured sport. Seeking an opportunity to offload his distinctly worn pair of cheap batting gloves that had contributed to a career average of 8.91, our wicketkeeper Ben offered them to the eager young American, even pulling out a pen and adorning them with an autograph to further reduce their nonexistent value. Jake was elated; an otherwise routine holiday lunch had turned into an unforgettable occasion. When we passed him on the way back to our hotel a while later, the old gloves with a new lease of life were still firmly strapped to his hands and he was proudly displaying them on a video call to a family member on the other side of the Atlantic, his wide smile showing no sign of fading.

2d96c94f1619,‘The road not taken haunts me to this day’: David Bishop on a rugby career full of regret,,"I magine, for a moment, the following scenario. Having broken his neck in a freak rugby accident and avoided paralysis by a millimetre, the player concerned is back for a meeting with his spinal consultant. The specialist advice is crystal clear. Make the most of your second chance and, if you fancy staying alive, never do either of the following again: dive off a high board or resume playing rugby. And now just imagine being the kind of guy who leaves the room and immediately nips home to pick up his swimming trunks before heading to the nearest swimming pool. Who puts on the swimmers, climbs up to the highest platform and dives straight off. Not once but twice. The rationale being that, if he survives, there will be no reason not to give rugby another go. Welcome to the scarcely believable and frequently mad world of “The Bish”. Anyone with the remotest knowledge of 1980s Welsh rugby union will instantly recognise the nickname. Along with all the hair-raising stories. David Bishop of Pontypool and, all too briefly, Wales remains perhaps the best “one-cap wonder” in the history of British team sport and unquestionably the most colourful. There were those who reckoned The Bish – the quasi-ecclesiastical nickname was bestowed on him by his late, great friend and Pooler teammate Eddie Butler – was an even better scrum-half than the legendary Gareth Edwards. And he was never the type to disabuse them. “At one stage I had an ego the size of Cardiff Arms Park, or the Principality Stadium, as we must now call it. I’d go so far as to suggest that a huge ego is almost essential to succeed. It didn’t really matter whether I was the best scrum-half in the world or not; the only way I’d perform at my best was if I believed I was.” There is more, much more, in Bishop’s fascinating and absorbing new autobiography, written with the help of the seasoned journalist Brendan Gallagher. Let’s just say it goes to places other rugby books never reach. Including Aylesbury prison where Bishop once spent 12 months behind bars for assault. Not forgetting the swollen River Taff where he once saved a mother and her baby from drowning. And the less salubrious parts of Cardiff where visiting fans never stray. “I marched around looking for scraps and fights, an angry and often dysfunctional young man who was much too quick to resort to fists and violence,” acknowledges Bishop. “It was the world I inhabited and that’s how things were sorted. When I look back, the sad fact is I didn’t grow up until I was nearly 40. It took me until then to become a fully formed, functioning adult.” David Bishop playing for Pontypool against Cardiff in 1983. Photograph: Mike Brett/Popperfoto/Getty Images A physically abusive father and a swift temper were both contributory factors. “Throughout my life, there was also a madness and a manic energy – a rage, almost – within me, which was definitely not normal and which I struggle to explain.” The cider – “or ‘electric lemonade’ as I know it” – and the cocaine didn’t help either. And neither did the infamous punch to the jaw of Newbridge’s Chris Jarman on 23 October 1985 that effectively ended his international career after only one Test, against Australia in 1984. For a variety of reasons, explained in greater detail in the book, Bishop’s punch assumed such notoriety that the incident attracted “Who shot JR?” levels of publicity. “I could easily have shot three people dead in Westgate Street in broad daylight or blown up the Arms Park and got less coverage,” reflects the perpetrator. He was initially sentenced to a month in jail only for the punishment to be suspended for a year on appeal. As far as his fledgling Wales union career was concerned, however, it was curtains. The majority view will be that Bishop, now 64, has only one person to blame for not having at least 50 caps and being remembered very differently. But better a sinner who repents and all that. And, in terms of articulating still-burning regret, Bishop’s book is as honest a sporting memoir as any in recent years. “There’s never a day when it doesn’t hurt,” he writes. “Becoming the starting Wales and Lions scrum-half was my life mission … and my inability to process my failure to complete this mission played a big part in my descending into depression and cocaine addiction after retiring. “I’ll never ever get over not having the Wales career I dreamed of; the career that should have been mine. The road not taken haunts me to this day. I thought it would get better with time, but it gets worse. I’m hoping this book will help. The final reckoning, if you like, after which I can perhaps find some peace of mind.” skip past newsletter promotion The latest rugby union news and analysis, plus all the week's action reviewed Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

There will be young Welsh professionals who dismiss this cautionary tale on the basis it reflects an era so different it cannot conceivably apply to them. Which, given the diminished state of Welsh rugby at present, is technically true. But ultimately Bishop’s book delivers a timely home truth for every gifted youngster: there is nothing worse in life than awaking one day and realising you’ve wasted your talent.

de557f422520,Liverpool’s struggles show that Trent Alexander-Arnold is not easily replaced,,"I t’s not a crisis, not yet, but Liverpool’s run of three defeats in a row is reason to take stock. It’s true that the two league games in that run were both lost via last-minute winners, and that in isolation these three games could be explained away relatively easily. But context matters, and the truth is that while Liverpool won their first five league games of the season, they did not play well in them. New players are struggling to settle and Arne Slot’s rejig of the formation has not really worked, while a number of regulars look out of sorts. Last season Liverpool won the league playing extremely controlled soccer, making 2-0 almost a trademark scoreline, establishing their lead and then running the clock down. This season there has been none of that, no sense of playing within themselves. They’ve been extremely open through midfield and most of their wins have come through late goals. There’s been an unexpected wildness to them, almost as though Slot is going through his transition a season late. Introducing any new player to a side is fraught with potential issues. The player has to learn their environment and their teammates have to get used to them. Even in the best cases, dropping a new player into a functioning side will lead to a slight short-term drop-off. Liverpool avoided that last summer by signing only Federico Chiesa. Adding five new players, as they did this offseason, means a lot of disruption. And, of course, this is a squad dealing with the tragic loss of Diogo Jota . Mohamed Salah’s on-pitch tears after the final whistle of the opening game of the season were a reminder that this is a club in mourning. Soccer keeps going, as it must, but the impact of Jota’s death is unpredictable and may be felt for a long time yet. At first it seemed the biggest tactical problem was the switch from 4-3-3 to 4-2-3-1 to accommodate Florian Wirtz as a central creator. The balance given by a central trio of Ryan Gravenberch, Alexis Mac Allister and Dominik Szoboszlai was gone, not helped by the fact that Mac Allister still doesn’t quite seem back to his best after a muscle injury, while Wirtz is yet to settle. But in recent games, Slot has returned to last season’s trio, switching back to 4-3-3, and many of the same problems have remained. Liverpool’s centre-backs keep being isolated, a situation exacerbated by Ibrahima Konaté’s loss of form. So what has changed? Why isn’t the centre-back pairing and midfield three that were so effective last season suddenly functioning? The answer is twofold. First, Liverpool’s press has stopped working as it once did. The 2020-21 season, in which Liverpool finished a distant third to Manchester City, offers a warning of what happens when that misfires. Second, and more intriguingly, new full-backs Miloš Kerkez and Jeremie Frimpong are very different from Andy Robertson and Trent Alexander-Arnold. skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Soccer with Jonathan Wilson Jonathan Wilson brings expert analysis on the biggest stories from European soccer Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

As a youth player he had been a midfielder and his gifts were those of somebody who would usually play in midfield. He is arguably the best passer of a ball currently playing for England, which is what led many to argue that he was wasted at full-back, and that he should be used in midfield. Attempts to play him there, though, were unconvincing, as though his years on the right of a back four had somehow rendered him unsuitable for a more central role. And yet he wasn’t a particularly good defender, at least if that is defined in the traditional way. He wasn’t great at marking, and he was, by the standards of top-level full-backs, relatively easy to dribble past. He is sui generis , which is one of the reasons he has never really looked convincing while playing for England. International soccer, given the lack of time available to coaches, prefers plug-in-and-play footballers, right-backs who play like right-backs. But Alexander-Arnold has two attributes that Liverpool are severely missing at the moment. His rapid and accurate 30- and 40-yard passes were often what released Salah, but his passing generally was central to Liverpool’s buildup play. Probably even more important, though, was his capacity to invert into midfield, to become an additional holding player alongside Gravenberch. Frimpong, who was a wing-back at Bayer Leverkusen, is a very different sort of full-back. He runs with the ball rather than passing it, and his natural inclination is to go on the outside not the inside. Given Salah wants to cut inside, that may work eventually. But for now, Liverpool are missing both the balance Alexander-Arnold brought and his capacity to unleash Salah, who has had a very quiet start to the season and is yet to forge a relationship with any of the new forwards. Any side making as many changes as Liverpool will inevitably have teething problems, but what is notable at the moment is that the issue is less the players who are there than one who has left. Alexander-Arnold’s unique range of abilities will not easily be replaced.",https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/oct/06/liverpools-struggles-show-that-trent-alexander-arnold-is-not-easily-replaced,Sport,BBC,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/94fda8fa6a430514a2acdb85347c5593ce6b5b7d/8_6_4992_3994/master/4992.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=628a1fcf2efff6c2de44a678da2020d8",2025-10-06T15:05:16+00:00,b6f96dd50681e68ffc1047c90839096e36703433
af15acfeddf2,"Chess: England jump to fifth at European championships, with outside medal chance",,"England’s open team jumped into an outside medal chance on Friday as this week’s European championships at Batumi, Georgia, passed the halfway mark. However, with only three rounds left after Saturday’s rest day, they still have to meet the front runners from Ukraine and the Netherlands. Leaders after six of the nine rounds: Open: 1 Ukraine 11 match points (15 game points), 2 Netherlands 10 (15.5), 3 Azerbaijan 9 (14). Also: 5 England 8 (14). Women: 1 Poland 12 (16.5), 2 Germany 9 (14), 3 Ukraine 9 (15,5). Also: 11 England 7 (13.5). Germany are placed second ahead of Ukraine due to superior Buchholz points. England’s Open strategy appeared to be for the experienced top boards, the former Russian champion Nikita Vitiugov and the nine-time British champion Michael Adams, to play solidly in a holding operation against the heavy hitters of the top teams, for Gawain Maroroa Jones and Luke McShane to play positively on three and four, and for Shreyas Royal, 16, to gain experience on the reserve board. Vitiugov has shown his class, and in Thursday’s fifth round he exploited his French opponent’s errors to win a pawn, then a piece, before finally trapping Black’s knight in the corner. Adams had his first defeat on Thursday after three draws while Jones has been the best performing England player, with three wins and two draws, including this sixth round recovery from a difficult opening. 3993: Peter Leko v Magnus Carlsen, Monaco 2007. Black to move and win. Carlsen had sacrificed a rook and bishop to keep the white king in the centre, but here chose 1...Qe4? allowing Leko to escape with a draw after 2 Ke2! Can you do better for Black? McShane, who lost in round two, recovered in round three when his Lithuanian opponent blundered. In round four McShane found his touch in a version of the Two Knights’ Defence which is popular in amateur chess, skilfully exploiting a small edge in an endgame of rook and two knights each. He lost again in round five after mishandling a superior position in time pressure, a recurrent weakness which still haunts him, but won well in round six. Royal, England’s youngest ever grandmaster, has held his own and won well against Lithuania in an endgame of rooks and opposite coloured bishops. England women drew 2-2 with Georgia 2 in round six, including a fine strategic game by Harriet Hunt. Jovanka Houska, the well-known online commentator, has been solid on top board for England women, although she is yet to win a game. The star so far has been Elmira Mirzoeva, 43, the former Moscow women’s blitz champion, whose 4/6 score included this incisive 24-move miniature where she destroyed her Czech opponent’s king defences. Bodhana Sivanandan, aged 10 and England’s youngest ever international player, has held her own with 1.5/3, and it could have been better still. After a 104-move marathon in round three which she lost narrowly, she reached a winning endgame next day but allowed a draw by threefold repetition. The European championships continue daily at noon BST on Sunday (Saturday is a rest day) and all the England games can be followed with computer assessments and commentary on lichess . Last weekend provided a double highlight for US chess. Last Friday, the US champion and world No 3, Fabiano Caruana, earned the $150,000 first prize at the St Louis-organised Grand Chess Tour in São Paulo, Brazil, defeating France’s Maxime Vachier-Lagrave in the final. Despite the huge prize fund, the GCT finals had their downside. All eight games in the semi-finals and final were halved, some in perfunctory fashion, as the GMs implicitly refused to risk their classical rating points and preferred to decide the event in rapid and blitz. The victor of the prestigious Sinquefield Cup, Wesley So, did not qualify for São Paulo. After winning in Brazil, Caruana flew to Arlington, Texas, for a USA v India match whose format was designed to bring chess into the sports mainstream. Its participants included women champions, influencers, and prodigies as well as top grandmasters. The time limit was just 10 minutes per player per game, with a one second per move bonus in the final minute. Draw offers were banned, as were resignations. Halved games were replayed with five minutes each, then with one minute. The US had White in all games, with the rationale that India would have White in a future return series on home ground. The audience in the Arlington Esports arena was encouraged to cheer and be noisy. Caruana opened with 1 c3 against the world No 4, Arjun Erigaisi, took control, and said afterwards: “The crowd knew I was winning, so I was happy to hear all the noise.” skip past newsletter promotion after newsletter promotion The US won the match 5-0, with the world No 2, Hikaru Nakamura, defeating the world champion, Gukesh Dommaraju, after two replayed draws. Their third game was a rare case of one-minute bullet played over the board. Bullet is a familiar format in online chess, with regular tournaments and an annual championship, but it hardly ever happens across the board due to the hazards of knocked over pieces. Nakamura v Gukesh provided a frantic scramble of moves, at the end of which Nakamura grabbed his opponent’s king, stood up, and threw the checkmated monarch into the cheering crowd. Is this the future of international chess? Not very likely … It was also a successful weekend for English players and England teams in Rabac, Croatia, where GM John Nunn, 70, won the silver medal at the European over-65 championship with an unbeaten 7/9 score. Nunn had previously won gold in 2023, but the Georgian GM, Zurab Sturua, retained his title from 2024 by a superior tie-break. Nunn led by half a point at the start of the final round, but in one of his books he had identified last round nerves as a recurring weakness, and he opted for a complex drawing line against the Najdorf Sicilian. John Piggott finished fourth with 6.5/9, while Nunn’s wife, Petra Fink-Nunn, won bronze in the women’s over-50 championship with an unbeaten 6/9. In one of Nunn’s best wins, he smoothly and instructively outplayed his Dutch opponent in a bishops of opposite colours ending. 3993 : 1…Qd8! threatens both 2…Bb4+ winning the queen (White’s d5 knight is pinned) and 2…Qxd5+ and 3…Qxh1 when Black is two pawns up.

82b02fa3ca51,‘You’re like: who am I?’ Katie Chapman on the challenges and danger of football retirement,,"“I loved competing,” says the former England international Katie Chapman. “I loved the adrenaline of it. That’s whatI missed, the adrenaline and addiction to competing. I spent years trying to find that feeling again. “I ran a couple of marathons and I did all sorts of things trying to hunt that feeling down, but I had to get it into my mind that I’m never going to have that feeling again in the same way. I had to teach myself to say: ‘Listen, you’re not going to get that back, so stop trying to find it.’ Once I got there, then I could move myself forward.” Chapman won a WSL title with Chelsea and two FA Cups before she ended a 22-year career that began with her debut for Millwall Lionesses in 1996 at the age of 14. She was a critical component in Arsenal’s 2006-07 quadruple-winning team, having joined from Charlton in 2006, and won 13 major trophies with the Gunners during two spells before signing for Chelsea. She is lacing up her boots again, for the second time in six and a half months, to take part in Chelsea’s legends match against Liverpool at Stamford Bridge on Saturday, having become the first woman to play for the Blues in the reverse fixture at Anfield. All proceeds from the game will go to the Chelsea FC Foundation and Chelsea Players’ Trust – two wings of the club Chapman is keen to support having found her step away from playing tough. Katie Chapman is thrown into the air by her Chelsea teammates after her final game in 2018. Photograph: Nigel French/PA Laura Cordingley, the CEO of the Chelsea Foundation, helps drive the work to support current and former players. “We have a huge duty of care towards those that have come before, not least because it’s really important to the club, but also from a foundation perspective, because our players and past players are so inspirational to the next generation of young people coming through,” she says. “Players can help us support the right narratives with young people too, with those who may or may not make it as professional football players.” The support is wide-ranging and for any player who has stepped through the doors in Cobham, be it for 10 years or one day. “It doesn’t matter when they may need support or what it looks like, we will be there for them,” Cordingley says. “What we really want to make sure is that we’re not overlapping. We work closely with the player care team in the academy and we make sure we’re greater than the sum of our parts. One of the first things we do is go to the PFA [Professional Footballers’ Association] and ask what support they have available. Then we look at how we can be additive to that. It’s about how we bring all the right people together to create the right package of support.” Chapman, who does many things including working as a pre- and postnatal personal trainer and co-hosting a grassroots football podcast, became a women’s ambassador for Chelsea after retiring, which was a lifeline, but she struggled. “It’s really tough,” she says. “I had a mortgage to pay and I had kids to look after and I did need to jump from one job to another. I didn’t have the time to breathe. I was lucky that Chelsea took me on as an ambassador that helped me with that gap between things. “I had a lot of anxiety for many years. When you’re an athlete you don’t show weakness – struggling is a weakness – and it’s hard sometimes for you to put yourself out there and ask for help and ask what help’s available. It took me quite a long time to come to terms with that and think: ‘I do need help, I do need support and it’s not a weakness.’ “I had counselling through the Professional Footballers’ Association when I hadcome to terms with the fact that I was really struggling. Back then there was support available, but did we really know it was there and have access to it? Not really. Did we understand what was available? Not really. I think that’s got better over the years.” Losing the structure and routine of professional football is “a big part of it”, she says. “You know what you’re doing on a daily basis, what you’re doing with your body, what training looks like, what meetings look like. Everything’s managed for you. There’s also an identity piece as well. You come out and you’re like: ‘Who am I?’” Katie Chapman stretches to make a challenge against France at the 2015 World Cup. Photograph: Steve Bardens/Fifa/Getty Images Chapman had another part of her life to fall back on. As a mother of three she slotted into being mum instead of professional player. “I dived into that and I’m grateful for that because I could have ended up in a different space,” the former Chelsea captain says. “Regardless of whether we think we’re ready for the next stage or not, the impact is massive. When I talk to a lot of people, not just in football, but around any sport, it’s the same.” The risk is that athletes stepping back from their sports, searching for new purpose and obsession, can find it in dark places. “It can become really dangerous,” says Chapman. “I came out of football and I was like: ‘Oh my God, I understand why people go off the rails and they go in all kinds of different directions and potentially find an addiction somewhere else.’ It is because you’re searching for that adrenaline piece, that feeling you got from competing, and we can all go different ways with that.” That is why she cares about the work being done to support players and is taking part in the legends match. That, and she would struggle to pass up an opportunity to play. “I love it. It makes me feel alive again and puts a smile on my face. It also gives me a rewarding feeling. Finding work that I love and that gives me a rewarding feeling is what matters most.” Katie Chapman says “When you’re an athlete you don’t show weakness – struggling is a weakness.” Photograph: Graeme Robertson/The Guardian Old habits die hard. “It’s funny, my mindset is that if I’m going to do these things, I have to be good,” says Chapman. “I train myself to be in the right condition. My mindset hasn’t changed in that sense. TI’m going out there representing women, women’s football. “If I want to keep pushing women’s football forward, I need to be in the right place and the right mindset to go into that game and give the best I possibly can.” Get in touch If you have any questions or comments about any of our newsletters please email moving.goalposts@theguardian.com .

b48bea4c9b21,7 Podcasts to Listen to After Watching ‘Monster: The Ed Gein Story’,,"7 Podcasts to Listen to After Watching ‘Monster: The Ed Gein Story’ From deep dives into the notorious killer to explorations of Psycho and the Holocaust, learn the real history behind Ryan Murphy's Netflix hit Producer Ryan Murphy loves to blur the line between fact and fiction , and there’s no shortage of that in his most recent entry, Monster: The Ed Gein Story . Ostensibly, the eight-part Netflix show is about Gein (played by Charlie Hunnam), a small-town Wisconsin farmer who was discovered in 1957 to have killed at least two women, grave-robbed several others, and used their remains to make grotesque clothing and decor for his home. His story became national news, and even after he was sent to an institution for the criminally insane for the rest of his life, it inspired young writers and filmmakers to create the archetype for modern horror: the monster hidden among us. In Monster , Murphy explores this idea by including dramatized scenes of the making of some of these films, including Psycho, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, and Silence of the Lambs . He also includes the fantasies Gein might have had about Ilse Koch, a Nazi who was accused of using the skin of her death camp victims to make lampshades and bind books. And like any good true crime series, the show leaves viewers wanting to know more. So, instead of spending hours scrolling and searching the web, we’ve curated seven podcasts that delve into the stories explored in Monster: The Ed Gein Story. The Compendium Podcast: Ed Gein: Monster, Murderer, and the Real Story Behind Hollywood’s Nightmares For a story like that of Ed Gein, whose crimes have become so deeply ingrained in American culture that they can sometimes be hard to see, it’s beneficial to have an outsider’s perspective. The Compendium Podcast is a little newer than a lot of the podcasts on this list — it launched in 2023 — but it’s done a good job establishing itself among a growing number of nerdy British buddy podcasts (check out The Rest Is History if you want the OG) by publishing well researched deep dives on everything from Ocean Gate and Heavens Gate to Princess Diana and Roald Dahl. In this episode, co-host Adam Cox walks the listener through the story, while co-host Kyle Risi offers reactions on Gein, his crimes, and the films he inspired. Last Podcast on the Left: Ed Gein Last Podcast on the Left is one of the longest-running comedy-true crime shows out there (quite possibly the only one). The hosts’ casual rapport can sometimes feel at odds with the seriousness of the crimes that they’re discussing, but the schtick of the show — one friend explaining a crime to a group of friends, a now-common premise they helped establish back in 2011 — works well with a crime like Gein’s, where there’s so much myth and rumor to discuss. Some points in this three-part series can feel a little dated (it was made in 2015, after all), but overall, it’s a detailed, deep dive into a complicated subject made by a group of podcasters at the top of their game. You’re Wrong About: Ed Gein and Slasher Movies For this episode of the excellent series You’re Wrong About , co-hosts Sarah Marshall and Michael Hobbes not only give a nice dive into Gein’s story, but use it as a jumping-off point to discuss horror cinema. Going down the rabbit hole on topics like America’s mid-century obsession with Freud, how 1970s horror films reflected changing opinions of the Vietnam War, and the transphobic message at the heart of Silence of the Lambs , it opens up new lines of thought in Monster ’s other story: that of Gein’s affect on American art. (If you’re curious about the themes explored in Monster ’s final episode, you might also check out Y ou’re Wrong About: Mindhunting where Marshall dives into the world of criminal profiling.) Unspooled: Psycho Unspooled , hosted by actor Paul Scheer ( The League, Black Monday ) and L.A. Times film critic Amy Nicholson, launched in 2018, initially working its way through the American Film Institute’s 100 best films of all time. Though they’ve long since branched out, on that original list was Psycho , clocking in at number 14. In this episode, Scheer and Nicholson only briefly touch on Gein himself, instead focusing more on a critical exploration of the film. But their discussions of the film — along with an interview with Alexandre O. Philippe, director of 78/52: Hitchcock’s Shower Scene , a documentary entirely about that cinematic murder — reveal how important this work was in the history of film. Inside Psycho Wonder’s eight-part series Inside Psycho, which came out in 2017, follows the formula of a lot of that podcast production company’s early shows: Told chronologically, with a cinematic, omnipotent perspective, it goes through the production of the film, from inspiration through its effect on Psycho director Alfred Hitchcock’s life and career. Although only the first episode focuses on Gein himself, the podcast delves into the nitty-gritty of how writer Robert Bloch used his knowledge of the case to write his novel, Psycho , and the adaptation took on Hitchcock and the film’s star, Anthony Perkins. Murphy took a lot of liberties in his dramatization of this in Monster , but this podcast gets closer to the truth. The Holocaust History Podcast: The Trials of Ilse Koch with Tomaz Jardim Hosted by historian Dr. Waitman Wade Beorn, The Holocaust History Podcast is a serious and sobering look at the Nazi regime during World War II. In this episode, he sits down with fellow historian Dr. Tomaz Jardim, author of Ilse Koch on Trial: Making the ‘Bitch of Buchenwald,’ to separate truth from fiction around this larger-than-life Nazi villain. While they take care to remind the listener that Koch was a full-blown Nazi who was morally complicit in the atrocities, they get past the layers of the caricature she became after the war, particularly the allegations that she used the skin of Jewish victims to make lampshades and bind books. That cartoonish figure is what Gein would have read about — and what Murphy shows in Monster — but they show that hers was a more mundane evil, and one shared by many wives of the Nazis in power. Morbid: Ed Gein What’s a podcast list without a couple of women who call their beloved fans “Weirdos” and chat about true crime? Sisters Alaina Urquhart and Ash Kelley host this long-running podcast, breaking Gein’s story into three parts: His life and upbringing (they have particularly harsh words for his mom); his crimes and capture; and his life after conviction and legacy. Unlike some other chatty podcast series, Urquhart and Kelley go through the story with empathy and care, and often cite their sources. Like many of the podcasts on this list, they rely heavily on Harold Schechter’s 1989 book Deviant: The Shocking and True Story of Ed Gein, the Original Psycho .",https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-lists/monster-ed-gein-podcast-1235444428,Entertainment,BBC,Elisabeth Garber-Paul,https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Monster__The_Ed_Gein_Story.jpg?w=1600&h=900&crop=1,2025-10-12T15:00:00+00:00,a7a3773ad8ece0dd6122d58b2621b5246157955f
38a180547215,The 20 Best NES Games of All Time,,"The 20 Best NES Games of All Time From duck and vampire hunts to boxing and football sims, these are the titles that made the Nintendo Entertainment System legendary It was in October of 1985 when the Nintendo Entertainment System first hit North America, with an initial test run of 100,000 units being sold exclusively in New York City. Following the post-Atari video game market crash of 1983, no one was sure if there’d even be an appetite for yet another new digital toy to connect to the TV. But after the massive reception to the device and launch titles like Baseball and Duck Hunt , the potential was clear. It was a new era of gaming, and the Japanese company Nintendo was leading the charge. Within that first month, Super Mario Bros. also arrived, later becoming a pack-in title for the nationwide release of the NES the following year. With its killer app firmly established, the NES would begin its pop culture takeover that lasted well into the Nineties, amounting to a nearly 62 million units sold across all regions — a success so big, it’s credited with saving the home console market altogether. And although it was powerful enough for its time and introduced several hardware gimmicks (the NES Zapper is a stroke of genius), the NES’ legacy will always be defined by its downright ludicrous library of software. On top of its own first-party games like Mario , Metroid , and The Legend of Zelda , the OG Nintendo console was home to fledgling franchises from external partners like Konami, Capcom, and Tecmo — all of whom worked symbiotically (and at times antagonistically) with the Big N. Dragon Quest , Final Fantasy , Ninja Gaiden ; so many of today’s gaming dynasties began on the NES. It can be tough to narrow down which of the console’s games are its best. While nostalgia plays a factor, it’s just a fact that much of its lineup feels dated to play today. But looking back, there’s an astonishing number of NES releases that hold up to modern standards, and even the ones that may feel rough around the edges retain an undeniable impact. A bona fide classic can always be measured by how much you love it, even when it’s a pain in the ass to play. So, from groundbreaking platformers to slick shooters, these are the best NES games of all time. ‘Tecmo Super Bowl’ Image Credit: Tecmo Although most folks love RPGs or action-packed shooters, it’s impossible to understate the impact of sport games as a cultural juggernaut. There’s just something spectacular about bridging the gap between the cult of IRL sports with playable fantasy. The NES arrived with a handful of big ones like the bluntly named Baseball and Tennis , but 1989’s Tecmo Bowl brought it to another level. The first console game to officially strike a licensing agreement with the NFL Players Association, Tecmo’s sports sim let players control real athletes like Jerry Rice and Joe Montana to compete in the living room. Its sequel, Tecmo Super Bowl, upped the ante by also licensing the official team names, making for the most authentic football experience on the NES. Tecmo Super Bowl may feel rudimentary now, but the progenitor to franchises like Madden continued to be popular for decades thanks to an obsessive modding community that updated the game’s roster each season to give it an exponential afterlife. ‘Bionic Commando’ Image Credit: Capcom A key part of platforming games is the ability to jump, but Capcom’s Bionic Commando offers an alternative by letting players swing like Spider-Man using the protagonist’s robot arm. The game is challenging — especially during the learning curve of mastering the mechanics of grabbing, swinging, and climbing — but once it clicks, there’s few titles quite like it. Due to the angles required by the swinging system, Bionic Commando was one of the first games to emphasize eight-way aiming, although it’s limited to the grapple feature. Later entries would include the ability to shoot more directions and (thankfully) extend the arm mid-air, but the original remains a feat of ingenuity at a time when action-platformers were cementing their foundations. In a crowded field, Bionic Commando stands apart. ‘Blaster Master’ Image Credit: Sunsoft One of gaming’s greatest blessings is just how stupid a story can be as justification for the action. Sunsoft’s Blaster Master opens with a cinematic sequence that depicts a young man named Jason, whose pet frog breaks free and dives into a hole in the ground. Obviously, Jason follows and discovers a giant battle tank — which he immediately commandeers to slay a race of subterranean mutants. After its bizarre setup, Blaster Master quickly sets into one of the most kinetic experiences ever developed for the NES. Jason’s tank is extremely agile, allowing players to move quickly, jump nimbly, and aim freely in multiple directions. Each of its eight labyrinthine levels are dense with areas to explore, and the action remains constant. The mobile mech controls of Blaster Master feel so smooth, you’d almost be convinced they’re from a later era, feeling like the natural predecessor to contemporary mech-suit series like Armored Core . ‘Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles III: The Manhattan Project’ Image Credit: Konami Although arcades were the true home of early beat ‘em ups, early consoles like the NES had their fair share too. One such gem was the NES-exclusive Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles III: The Manhattan Project , which arrived in 1991 just when turtle mania was at its apex. With controls based on the previous entry, which itself was built off the coin-up arcade version of TMNT , The Manhattan Project is a mechanically streamlined gauntlet of ass-kicking. The game can be played solo or as a pair and features the ability to toggle on and off friendly fire (depending on how much you want to agitate your siblings). Like other TMNT games, each level is filled with an array of baddies from the animated series like Bebop and Rocksteady, as well as many iterations of Foot Clan soldiers, all of which have unique abilities based on their colors. While its SNES sequel, Turtles in Time may be heralded as the best in the series, The Manhattan Project is a high point for NES-era beat ‘em ups. ‘Excitebike’ Image Credit: Nintendo One of the best-selling games for the NES, Excitebike has one hell of a legacy. Developed by Shigeru Miyamoto for its 1984 Japanese release, the motocross racing game wasn’t just extremely well-designed in its own right, but its systems would influence other titles across genres for generations. Most directly, its 2D side-scrolling controls were adapted for Super Mario Bros ., giving the lead character his trademark inertia-building energy while running and jumping. Later on, its DNA could be felt in everything from Wave Race 64 to Flappy Bird , where strategically holding a button to gain altitude and angling the correct pitch for landing is key. But even if it hadn’t been so influential, Excitebike would still just be a damned fun game that holds up exceptionally well today. Dodging between lanes and correcting timing a jump boost is exhilarating, and the desire to best your own time always warrants another lap. ‘Super Dodge Ball’ Image Credit: CSG Imagesoft Long before the Ben Stiller movie introduced the idea of dodging a wrench as training for dodgeball, this spin-off of the River City game series made the gym class sport into a brutal proposition. Players control a six-man squad of ballers, with three populating the infield and another three surrounding the opposing team on the fringes of the court. Balls can be thrown plainly, but by initiating a sprint and properly timing the pitch, a superpowered special beans the opponent hard enough to propel them into the invisible walls. Like many games of the era, the visuals are janky. There’s almost never a moment when one or more characters are fully visible, constantly flickering and clipping in and out of frame. Yet the gameplay is smooth, precise, and surprisingly deep in its complexity. Traveling the world to conquer the dodgeball league is fun, but the real treat is the “bean ball” mode that boils the action down to a six-man free-for-all in a schoolyard where there are no rules or borders — only the ball and your killer instinct. ‘StarTropics’ Image Credit: Nintendo One of the few titles developed for the NES to never be released in Japan, StarTropics is a strange mash-up of RPG exploration and dungeon-crawling that feels like multiple games blended into one. The story follows a 15-year-old named Mike Jones who is visiting his archaeologist uncle on a tropical island. After his uncle goes missing, Mike must follow the clues gleaned from conversations with various townspeople that lead into different multi-level dungeons filled with puzzles to solve and creatures to beat with his trusty yo-yo and baseball-inspired kit. At times, it feels like Zelda , with shades of Final Fantasy , but the game oddly shares much of its DNA with the Japanese-only release, Mother (1989), which also followed a boy armed with a yo-yo and baseball bat for a fantasy adventure. StarTropics ultimately spawned just one sequel, but its genre-mixing premise and lush environments would make for a great modern revival, should Nintendo be so inclined. ‘R.C. Pro-Am’ Image Credit: Rare You’d think that the best racing game on the NES would involve high-power motorcycles or spaceships, but in truth, all that’s needed is a set of remote-controlled cars. Developed by Rare well before they reinvented Donkey Kong on the SNES , R.C. Pro-Am is an inventive take on top-down racing that wringed every ounce of power out of its console for finely tuned controls and solid physics. The game is played from a three-quarter perspective rather than from the rear of the cars, making it possible to turn in a full 360 degrees — often by mistake. The POV is distinct, forcing you to focus on the track’s many curves and anticipate the positioning needed, but it’s generous in how easily one can course correct a miscalculation. Instead of leaning into speed or hazards on the horizon, the rally vibe of Pro-Am offer a different way to race that’s surprisingly enthralling despite its quaintness. ‘Duck Hunt’ Image Credit: Nintendo Duck Hunt needs little introduction. One of the key launch titles for the NES’ North American market, its appeal is obvious. Utilizing the Zapper peripheral, it brought shooting gallery games from arcades and bars to people’s homes, and became a sensation so big, it was paired with Super Mario Bros. in a single cartridge as the must-have Nintendo games for many years. Its concept is simple: players aim the handheld gun at their CRT screen (it unfortunately doesn’t work with modern flatscreens) and shoot either flying ducks or play pigeons round after round in carnival game fashion. It’s a lizard-brained kind of pleasure, and is enjoyable at any skill level — although children of the Eighties likely have memories of being scolded for sitting too close to the TV. (Not cheating!) ‘Life Force’ Image Credit: Konami A spin-off of the Gradius series, Life Force (called Salamander in Japan) is a classic side-scrolling spaceship shooter where players must battle waves of flying baddies and constant environmental hazards, powering themselves up with pick-ups along the way. While Gradius itself is the bigger name and would be worthy of inclusion on any list, Life Force is the superior choice for numerous reasons. Firstly, the game is more forgiving, allowing players to bounce back from death right where they fell rather than being sent back to an arbitrary checkpoint. Secondly, its power-up system is streamlined, and allows multiple items to be combined to create an insane arsenal. Fully playable in co-op, Life Force is one of the best two-person games available for the NES. ‘Punch-Out!!’ Image Credit: Nintendo One of the most instantly recognizable names from the NES era, Punch-Out!! has seen multiple re-releases that will quickly pinpoint when someone picked up the game. The 1987 version featured then-World Heavyweight boxing champion Mike Tyson as its final boss, with a later 1990 release swapping out the at-times problematic (and pricey to license) real-life figure for the fictional creation, Mr. Dream. Adapted from Nintendo’s own arcade series, Punch-Out!! is arguably the best boxing game ever made. While it lacks the realism and depth of more contemporary franchises, its emphasis on rhythm and learning an opponent’s weakness was brilliant for the time. Aside from the entry-level fighter Glass Joe, bouts demand a deft balance of stamina management and reading each person’s tells, with specific behavior and character animations indicating when it’s time to dodge or strike, and in which direction. Endlessly playable, it’s a franchise that’s come and gone throughout Nintendo’s history, and there’s never a bad time to bring it back. ‘Dragon Quest III: The Seeds of Salvation’ Image Credit: Square Enix The NES as a platform was ground zero for numerous iconic roleplaying games like Final Fantasy and Fire Emblem , but the best of the bunch was Dragon Warrior ( Dragon Quest in Japan). The Americanized title has fallen by the wayside in recent years as Dragon Quest became more popular globally, and the third entry is considered by many to be the essential starting point. Featuring artwork from Dragon Ball creator Akira Toriyama , and RPG mechanics that will be familiar to fans of tabletop and video games of all eras, Dragon Quest III may look visually modest, but it plays extremely well. With a sprawling open world that allows for non-linear exploration, a heavily detailed class system that lets new recruits choose their abilities, and an epic fantasy narrative, Dragon Quest III is the definitive NES RPG. ‘Contra’ Image Credit: Konami One look at Contra ’s box art will tell you that it’s going for peak late-Eighties machismo. Equal parts Rambo , Predator , and Aliens , the run and gun side-scrolling shooter pits players as meathead commandos Bill Rizer or Lance Bean (or both in co-op) on a jungle mission to wipe out an alien army. Some stages scroll left-to-right while others move vertically, but the game’s greatest strength is its kinetic set pieces where big enemies arrive at scripted intervals to fuck things up. While many shooters of the era can feel clunky, Contra remains slick, with players easily able to drop between different layers of each level and drop prone to dodge incoming projectiles. Its weapons upgrade system is straightforward, requiring just simple item pickups to suddenly give the commandos spinning flamethrowers and big-balled shotgun blasts. Even though it’s been iterated on countless times, the original Contra is the ultimate form of dumb fun. ‘Metroid’ Image Credit: Nintendo Although Nintendo’s early work was mostly rooted in cheery cartoon aesthetics, one game stood out as something decidedly darker. Heavily influenced by Ridley Scott’s Alien , Metroid dropped players into a desolate world with little direction and even less hope. Players take on the role of Samus Aran, a lethal bounty hunter on the trail of a faction of space pirates who are harboring a mysterious biological weapon (spoiler: it’s a metroid!). Although it might feel like a chore to play for many today, the original Metroid popularized a dizzying amount of video game mechanics and tropes that’re currently employed in games like Hollow Knight and even 3D series like Elden Ring . Samus starts extremely weak, with minimal abilities to traverse the mazelike terrain. Inching along chamber-by-chamber (and hopefully drawing a map), players must find new tools that will open up blocked paths in older areas. While its SNES sequel would perfect these ideas, the first game is no slouch, and is every bit worth revisiting, if only to see an early vision of gaming’s present. ‘Castlevania III: Dracula’s Curse’ Image Credit: Konami It’s an odd trend in the NES era where the third entry of certain franchises ends up being chronologically a prequel, as is the case with Castlevania III: Dracula’s Curse . While the second game in the series leaned more heavily into RPG elements, Dracula’s Curse reverted to a more straightforward action-heavy approach, letting players explore multiple branching paths but always solving problems with a simple crack of the whip. A first for the series, the game stars multiple protagonists that can be swapped on the fly: vampire hunter Trevor Belmont, sorceress Sypha Belnades, pirate Grant Danasty, and Alucard — the dhampir son of Dracula himself. With a rich gothic atmosphere and moody soundtrack, Castlevania III is among the most aesthetically pleasing titles for the NES, and one of the most rewarding to play. Its story was recently adapted into Netflix’s Castlevania anime series, driving many to go back to explore its 8-bit origins. ‘Ninja Gaiden’ Image Credit: Koei Tecmo During the Seventies and Eighties, ninjas were all the rage. Obviously, the shadowy warriors would inspire waves of video games, among the best of which was the Ninja Gaiden series. Tecmo’s side-scrolling action series was acclaimed at the time for its then-cutting edge cinematic cutscenes, which told the narrative in animated sequences preceding each stage. In action, the game’s action is razor-sharp and its platforming is innovative, letting players cling to walls and bounce between tiers with the agility of a shinobi. Compared to its contemporaries, Ninja Gaiden ’s combat is surgical, allowing the hero Ryu to strike down foes with a single slice, although they continually regenerate and can become quickly overwhelming. It can be extremely tough to best all 20 levels, but for those up to the challenge, Ninja Gaiden is a perfect slice of retro action gaming. ‘The Legend of Zelda’ Image Credit: Nintendo One of Nintendo’s most prolific franchises, The Legend of Zelda has a long history of delivering some of the greatest games of all time . But it all began with the NES original, which presented many players with their first experience with a truly open world to explore. Starring the elf-eared hero Link, the game is all about discovery as users trek through the various biomes of Hyrule, stumbling across dungeons and secret chambers that house crucial items to reach new areas and combat enemies. The game’s open-ended environment is miraculous given the limitations of the NES, but it begins to make sense once players figure out the world’s grid-like regions. For many, the only way to solve its mysteries was to use a physical map, scribbling solutions, theories, and X’s to mark each critical spot. The NES was home to a multitude of grandiose fantasy adventures, but none were as legendary as Zelda . ‘Super Mario Bros.’ Image Credit: Nintendo There will never be another game like the first Super Mario Bros . While the NES debuted with a full lineup of bangers, the 1985 platformer blew the lid off the industry when it arrived, quickly being retrofitted as the pack-in title that warranted the purchase of the console itself. It was the Nintendo game, and in many ways, it still is. Designed by the maestro behind most of the company’s early classics, Shigeru Miyamoto, Super Mario Bros. plucked the playable hero from 1981’s Donkey Kong arcade game and gave him a complete overhaul. Firstly, he got a name (Mario!), as well as a brother (Luigi!), but most importantly, he gained the distinct ability to run and jump with extreme precision. Over the years, most players have completely memorized the various stages of the game to the point where you can see it with eyes closed, but it’s to the game’s credit that even if you (somehow) never tried it, it’s insanely easy to learn. Forty years after its release, Super Mario Bros . plays like a dream, with an incredible sense of momentum and tight control. And on top of inspiring thousands of games throughout decades, it almost singlehandedly saved gaming as the crown jewel of a console whose phenomenal popularity reinvigorated the industry. ‘Mega Man 2’ Image Credit: Capcom There’s something to be said for the value of player choice, and Capcom’s Mega Man series is built on the simple conceit of letting people pick how they want to tackle its challenges. At the start of each attempt, you’re presented with a list of eight levels to choose from, each with their own environmental theme and a special boss at the end. The hitch is that each of the bad guys can be more easily thwarted by another one’s abilities (which Mega Man himself gains after killing them). Which way do you start? What’s the ideal flowchart for beating them all? Sometimes, it just boils down to which ones you’re able to defeat. Mega Man 2 is the series’ best installment, famously perfecting the run and gun gameplay introduced by its predecessor while improving the level design. If Mario lets players rely on twitchy response time and frequently forgiving physics, Mega Man is all about methodical progression. Each level introduces entirely new elements, like conveyer belts of conflicting speeds and opposite trajectories that demand measured timing to traverse while being assailed by robots. The arc of the game is deeply memorable, a Jacob’s Ladder-like ascension through all levels into the endgame, which consists of a sequence of linear stages plus a second round with every one of the previous bosses. It’s a grueling gauntlet, but Mega Man 2 lives at the nexus of stellar action and platforming perfection. ‘Super Mario Bros. 3’ Image Credit: Nintendo How Nintendo managed to one-up its flagship title remains a marvel. The first attempt to create direct sequel to Super Mario Bros. was famously a bust. While the Japanese attempt mostly amounted to a more difficult expansion ( The Lost Levels ), the American one was literally a reskin of an entirely different game with the newly popular characters swapped in. Neither hit the mark, and for the third installment, Nintendo needed to think bigger. Super Mario Bros. 3 took everything the original did so well and exponentially upped the ante. Its levels are compact, dense with increasingly complex physical puzzles of dexterity whose solutions are taught organically in motion. Its visuals are lively; the many regions of the Mushroom Kingdom all feel distinct and packed to the brim with personality. The power-ups, from the Fire Flower to the Tanooki Suit, all give players an edge without making them helpless by losing them. While the 1985 game introduced the characters and world, it was Super Mario Bros 3. that cemented countless staples of the franchise that continue today. The world map lets players choose which routes to take between levels and provided bonus stages to hoarding items. The addition of new powerups let Mario take to the sky with the Super Leaf or throw projectiles in the Hammer Suit. Each of Bowser’s children, the Koopalings, provided a different threat as regional bosses rather than being different flavors of the same old thing. Generations later, gaming doesn’t get much better than Super Mario Bros. 3 . Despite its vintage, it’s a guaranteed joy to pick up and play, no matter how many times you’ve beat it. Although the NES would continue getting new releases well into the early Nineties, it ultimately peaked here. Super Mario Bros. 3 is the embodiment of everything that makes a Nintendo game great, and is easily the best of what the era had to offer.",https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/rs-gaming-lists/best-nes-games-of-all-time-1235442260,Entertainment,BBC,Christopher Cruz,https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/NES_2-1.jpg?w=1600&h=900&crop=1,2025-10-12T14:00:00+00:00,2452de7d2b8ba8741343c656008e604d6fd0529c
cd22c222aff4,"There’s Now a Casino in Everyone’s Pocket. For Some Young Men, It’s a Near-Fatal Gamble",,"F or Andrew Douglas, bottom was seven cops banging on the door of his apartment. He’d sharpened the knife “good,” filled the bathtub with water, and downed a vial of Coumadin to bleed out faster. Had his dad not sensed something and dialed 911, Andrew, a star baseball player turned gambling addict in college, would have quietly checked out at age 33, leaving his twin infant sons, his guilt-crippled parents, and many thousands of dollars in gambling debts behind. For Jonah, bottom wasn’t failing out of college and mulling suicide. Nor was it the month in a Florida rehab, where, for some fool reason, they let him have his cellphone and he bet money he’d stolen from family on four-legged parlay bets. (More on parlays later.) No, for Jonah, a lacrosse player at a powerhouse program, bottom was crossing the last bridge of honor: trading inside info with players at other schools to cover the over/under on games they bet. For the seven mostly young men sitting around this table, bottom was a grave of their own digging — a hole so deep that their cries for help went unheard. “My thoughts were too crazy, I thought that no one would get them,” says Marcus, a mid-twentysomething dressed like a gamer: black glasses, high-top Chucks, and a Playskool-colored sweatshirt. At his bottom, he was staring out the window of his apartment, weighing whether a fall from five flights up would kill or merely maim him. “I got to where suicide sounded sane.” (Excepting Andrew, above, the gamblers in this story spoke in exchange for anonymity.) We’re lunching at a sports bar in a Philadelphia suburb, picking at taste-free wings and waffle fries. It’s a curious place to bring a group of recovering gamblers, but the man at the head of the table has his reasons. Harry Levant has always been a rower against the river: a former criminal-defense attorney who lost his license, and nearly lost his life, to his own gambling jones a decade back; a second-chance crusader and addictions counselor who mainly treats folks gutted by gambling disorders; and a peripatetic opponent of the online gambling behemoths DraftKings and FanDuel , and the other sports-betting operators (hereafter, SBOs). Forty weeks a year, Levant’s somewhere in the air, lecturing state legislators and groups of physicians about the betting apps’ ploys and snares, as well as the harms he says they’ve levied on Gen Z males. That grail of Levant’s reads lonely and self-devouring: the mania of the gambler repurposed for public service. “Every addictive product has regulations,” says Levant. “Why is this the only one without them?” As his clients tell their stories, a loose narrative hangs together. With an exception here and there, most of these guys started gambling as teens, playing lunchroom hold-em and NFL parlays for a buck or two a throw. Then they got to college, rooming and running with older kids. Here, suddenly, everyone seemed to be in action, be it betting stupid sums on esports soccer or throwing 15 bucks at a five-legged parlay that paid out 20 to one but rarely cashed. (A parlay is a combo bet on two or more outcomes; to collect, you must win each outcome, or “leg.” Should you hit on four legs but miss the fifth, you lose whatever money you put down. Oh, and the odds of winning that five-legged parlay? Less than five percent.) Hospitalized after a suicide attempt due to gambling debts, Andrew Douglas says nurses turned on the NBA Finals and handed him his phone: “I gambled away my last $100.” The portals and drivers for much of this action were the giant sports-bet apps. On the party-colored killing floor of online gambling, FanDuel and DraftKings own most of the take, cornering 80 percent of the mobile bet market in this country. Eight years ago, Americans placed around $5 billion in sports bets. Last year, that number zoomed to nearly $150 billion; by 2028, we’ll have bet — and lost — a trillion dollars since 2018. That was the year the Supreme Court reversed a federal ban on legalized gambling, freeing each state to partner with Big Sports Bet and feed their residents, especially the young ones, to the wolves. FanDuel and DraftKings wasted no time. They’d spent hundreds of millions of dollars, and the better part of a decade, carpet-bombing the airwaves with ads. Now, they paid kings’ ransoms to each of the major sports leagues in exchange for their data and branding, and partnered with, or bought up, AI firms to help target their users’ browsing habits, favorite teams, and sports. “DraftKings, for one, bought SimpleBet, the biggest AI firm in this space, to turn data into in-game microbets,” says Levant. “Then they tracked and used their customers’ data to determine which of them preferred making constant, nonstop bets — and pushed those bets their way.” Bombarded by promos for FanDuel and DraftKings — “Get a $1,000 deposit bonus!” reads one DraftKings blast — underage boys pressed their parents to open accounts, often linked to dad’s ID and banking info, critics claim. Or they surreptitiously opened accounts without their parents’ knowledge, as teens have done with verboten vices since the dawn of time. “Young guys have always bonded around sports; it’s wired into their pack behavior,” says Levant. “What the apps do is monetize that pack behavior: Guys bond over sports bets, not sports, now.” Reached for comment on the matter, DraftKings and FanDuel pushed back on the contention that underage gambling is rampant on their apps, pointing to the safeguards they have in place. “DraftKings is committed to providing a legal, regulated, and responsible gaming environment for adults,” wrote a spokesperson for the company. “We employ advanced Know Your Customer (KYC) technology, relied on by the financial industry and law enforcement, to verify the age of our customers. Any use of our platform by minors violates both our Terms of Use and the law, and we actively monitor to detect and report this prohibited activity.” It bears noting that neither SBO agreed to on-the-record interviews for this piece. Instead, they responded with written statements, like the one from FanDuel, as follows: “As a legal, licensed and regulated operator, we ​have focused on the importance of educating college students on the risks associated with gambling. Notably, recovered problem gambler and national TV host Craig Carton brings lived experience and well-documented struggles with gambling to campuses through the FanDuel Responsible Gaming College Tour. Additionally, we have extended our education efforts to reach families by creating the Trusted Voices parent portal which provides tools and resources to talk to young people about gambling, associated risks, how to recognize warning signs and where to go for support.” To be clear, most adults who gamble on sports do so as a harmless time suck, a way to zest their weekend football viewing. And  countless teens put 10 spots on ballgames without getting dragged into addiction . “There are kids with a healthy relationship to money who can gamble casually on sports,” says Jody Bechtold, the CEO and founder of the Better Institute in Pittsburgh and a distinguished lecturer on gambling addiction. “But there are lots of other kids wired differently these days — high anxiety, ADHD, over-immersion in video games — who’re at much higher risk of addiction.” That’s especially so for kids “from affluent families who never learned the value of a dollar. Money’s supposed to hurt when you lose it,” but they were raised on “all things cashless: Venmo, PayPal, you name it.” Two years ago, the NCAA published a study on the steep surge of gambling on college campuses. It found that 67 percent of students living on campus were betting on sports — though simple math tells us that the large majority of those bettors likely wouldn’t have been of legal age to do so. Worse, many engaged in a particularly rash form of gaming, making high-speed wagers on in-game action — a pernicious new product called microbetting. Last year, a study by the National Council on Problem Gambling found that betting on campus had surged to 75 percent — and that six percent of students were addicted to gambling, or nearly double the national average. And who on campus is qualified to treat this gusher of gambling addictions? Essentially no one, per the experts I talked to. “Colleges aren’t set up to treat [six percent] of their students,” says Jim Lange, the executive director of the Higher Education Center for Alcohol and Drug Misuse Prevention and Recovery at Ohio State University. “That isn’t our business model, and never will be.” He added that most schools don’t even know they have a problem: Gambling is scarcely mentioned in the National Collegiate Health Assessment, the standard tool used by schools to track drug and alcohol misuse by students. None of those stats is news to the young men sitting at this table. “When I owed money to every kid I knew and was betting on Chinese ping-pong at 4 a.m., I tried going for counseling on campus,” says Marcus, the gamer kid. “As I’m talking to the counselor, she’s pulling a manual off the shelf, looking up [the definition of] ‘problem gambling.’” FanDuel and DraftKings have paid king’s ransoms to each of the major sports leagues in exchange for their data and partnered with AI firms to help target users’ habits. Ron Vesely/Getty Images “In the hospital, where I was hooked up to a bunch of IVs [after his failed suicide bid], they turned the NBA Finals on and gave me my phone; I gambled away my last $100,” says Andrew, the ex-baseball player. Things were no better during his 30-day stay at an addiction clinic in Florida. “They didn’t touch on gambling at all.” So, too, for Jonah, the former lacrosse player, sent to an out-of-state facility at 21. “This place knew nothing about gambling addiction. They gave us two hours of phone time a day, and I set up a VPN to bet in Philly.” I hear a collective intake of breath as Jonah wraps his story. For all the suffering at this table, there’s a redemptive kinship as well, and a recognition that feels like rescue. The six percent of college kids who lose $500 or more in a day? “We used to be those kids,” says Marcus, to grunts and knowing head nods. “This is what it looks like, five years later.” Thousands of dollars stolen from a doting grandma. A bride empaupered months after her wedding. Betrayals so base they can’t be spoken to other people — but with this group, there are no secrets or judgments; only gratitude for the chance to come clean. Eight years ago, Americans placed around $5 billion in sports bets. Last year, that number zoomed to nearly $150 billion “After all those months and years in the cold, here you’re among friends who know exactly what you’ve gone through,” says Levant. “And all I ask in return from these guys: Don’t make a bet today.” Andrew cuts in here to show me his phone. “Look at that top email, from Caesars,” he says. It reads, Your mystery bonus is here . “Four years since I shut down that app, they’re still tryna get their hooks in me.” “And that,” says Levant, “is why I chose this place.” He points to the flat-panels mounted above the tables, 50 or 60 sets tuned to Fox Sports 1 or the umpteenth rerun of “First Take.” Every last one of them posts a ticker at the bottom: Odds brought to you by either FanDuel or DraftKings. “This is what these guys have to live with,” says Levant. “They can’t run from sports or those fucking apps. All they can do is change their response.” A Caesars Sportsbook logo looms large over the scoreboard at Rate Field in Chicago. Patrick Gorski/Icon Sportswire/Getty Images MALIK BEASLEY, A SIZZLING SCORER and prime free agent, may never see the floor in another game. After nearly $60 million made in the NBA, he’s awash in debt and unwanted by teams after a federal DA poked through his gambling tabs. ( Recently cleared in that probe , he remains unsigned as basketball season approaches.) Emmanuel Clase is one of the best closers in baseball, but he won’t get to throw another pitch until the sport gets done scouring his prop-bet plays. Clase faces a lifetime ban if MLB can prove he engaged in spot-fixing, the practice of shading his own stat lines by intentionally sailing a slider over his catcher’s head. Jontay Porter could be headed to prison shortly: The NBA center copped to conspiracy to commit wire fraud recently for his part in a prop-bet ring. And Ippei Mizuhara is doing fed time already for stealing millions from his famous boss, Shohei Ohtani, to pay off gambling debts. If men who have everything can’t stop betting long enough to save their prized careers, how will we keep a generation of teens from taking a match to their futures? We find ourselves on the cusp of this disaster thanks in part to a petition brought in 2018 by Gov. Phil Murphy of New Jersey. Murphy and his predecessor, Gov. Chris Christie, filed a brief with the U.S. Supreme Court, seeking to decriminalize wagers on sports in their state. They were suing to unleash a product so destructive that in 2013 the doctors and clinicians of the American Psychiatric Association added “gambling disorder” to the list of substance disorders in their revised standard text, the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Volume 5. It was an extraordinary upgrade, says Levant, the first of its kind: warning readers of a “substance” they couldn’t smoke, shoot, or snort, but which was nonetheless “highly addictive” and “similar in nature to heroin, opioids, tobacco, alcohol, and cocaine.” “We reclassified gambling because it shared the symptomology of classic narcotic addiction, “ says Dr. Petros Levounis, past president of the APA. “We’re greatly concerned now because of the rise in sports betting. There’s a striking likeness to the tobacco and opioid industries — and there’s consensus among us that those industries committed crimes that resulted in suffering and death.” (Approached for comment, Murphy sent this boilerplate: “The Murphy Administration is concerned by the growing national epidemic of online sports-betting addiction, particularly among young men. What begins as occasional recreational betting too often spirals into financial instability, anxiety and depression, and high-risk habits. Our Administration is committed to mitigating the risks associated with problem gambling, including expanding treatment options and holding bad operators accountable.”) FanDuel and DraftKings have cornered 80 percent of the mobile sports-bet market in America. Rob Carr/Getty Images Harmful substances, such as alcohol and narcotics, are typically regulated and controlled. But when presented with what some experts call “the biggest public health threat since Big Tobacco,” SCOTUS killed the only law shielding Americans from the corporate bet sharks. That law, called PASPA (Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act), did precisely what its title proposed. It protected pro and college sports leagues from point-shave rings; kept the Mob (and enraged bettors) off the backs of the players; and put so much physical distance between gamblers and casinos that they couldn’t lose their shirts on a passing hunch. To be sure, problem gamblers found their way around it, opening accounts with offshore sportsbooks or a local guy-who-knew-a-guy. But the damage was contained to the vulnerable few, which is about the best you can hope for from a law. What followed, post-PASPA, was so predictable, you couldn’t have gotten odds for it at Vegas. A sanctimonious foe of sportsbooks for decades, the NFL immediately entered talks with FanDuel and DraftKings. For billions in betting revenue, the league leased those firms the rights to its stat packs, metrics, and branding. That proprietary data enabled the apps to launch a brand-new product: live, in-game wagers on practically anything that happened on field. No longer were kids forced to wait hours on an outcome; now, they could bet on every play and every player through AI-brokered props in real time. That phenomenon, called microbetting, forever changed gambling by turbo-boosting the speed of betting behaviors. The effect of microbetting, if not its intent, is to induce a fugue state that keeps users in action. “You lose track of time and space, and next thing you know, you’re betting Indian cricket at 4 a.m.,” says Marcus. “I don’t even know the rules of cricket. Those fuckin’ matches go on for three days!” Every major pro sports league followed football’s lead, selling their data for a slice of the sports-bet pie. The effect on problem gamblers was catastrophic. “I went from betting money lines on baseball games to betting the number of runs scored in every inning,” says Frankie, a client of Levant’s in his late twenties with a South Philly brogue and a shiny widow’s peak. “Any money left at the end of the night, I’m flipping to FanDuel’s casino. Then it’s slots and blackjack till I bust, and now I’m betting Chinese ping-pong at 3 a.m.” A year ago May, Frankie married his sweetheart in a grand Italian wedding. The guests sent them off with a pillowcase full of cash. Behind his wife’s back, Frankie lost all the cash, then defaulted on the mortgage for their house. “I didn’t know where to turn,” he says. “Suicide was my only option till I found Harry.” Two years ago, the NCAA published a study on the steep surge of gambling on college campuses. It found that 67 percent of students living on campus were betting on sports Those microbets and parlay packs that hooked Levant’s clients are the SBOs’ profit centers. How do we know this? Because the apps themselves say so: They’re the bets featured in their ads. Kevin Hart, Rob Gronkowski, Tom Brady, LeBron James: You can’t shut them up and make them go away when they’re touting props and parlays in every promo. Nor can you squelch their motormouthed peers on the pods and sports-bet shows: the Bill Simmonses and Charles Barkleys and Scott Van Pelts, who’ve merrily boarded the gravy train as “ambassadors” for the SBOs. (Approached for comment, Simmons, Barkley and Van Pelt declined to speak.) “Among the dangers of celebrity endorsements is the normalization of an addictive product,” says Levant. “They’re accepting enormous sums to push [that] addictive product on an increasingly younger audience.” AFTER THE FALL OF PASPA, states raced one another to the betting window, smelling 10-figure windfalls in new taxes. Thirty-nine states plus D.C. and Puerto Rico passed bills that legalized the sports-bet racket. The ensuing carnage was swift and savage. New callers flooded the toll-free hotlines at 1-800-GAMBLER, and frantically searched the web for help, googling “gambling addiction” online. The state of New Jersey saw a nearly 300 percent spike in hotline calls in the first five years of legal betting. (Around six percent of its residents now suffer from gambling disorders — or three times the national average, per a Rutgers survey .) In Connecticut, the number of hotline calls increased 200 percent in the first two years — and the crisis was most acute among young men. “Forty percent of those calls are coming from twentysomething males,” says Diana Goode, the executive director of the Connecticut Council on Problem Gambling, who likens the legalization of gambling to the opioid crisis. “It’s literally the same thing they did with pain pills. These companies hand out free samples [i.e., welcome bonuses] to get [young men] addicted to betting.” Gambling-addiction expert Jody Bechtold says young men are especially susceptible to the dangers of this culture because they’ve grown up immersed “in a stew of ads” from the Big Two betting apps. Brett Carlsen/Getty Images I put the obvious question to clinician after clinician: Why are young people, males in particular, so susceptible to sports-bet apps? Bechtold, the founder and director of the Better Institute in Pittsburgh, began with the mile-high view. “This generation was basically bred for addiction, [having been] raised on cellphones inches from their faces.” The feeds on those devices “disrupted their neural wiring,” leaving them anxious, impulsive, and susceptible to “stims that are quick and constant onscreen.” Their online childhoods also robbed them of life skills best learned by leaving the house. Fiscal savvy gained by working part-time jobs. Risk awareness from running the streets, and an acquired sense of consequences from actions. “When these kids go bust, time after time it’s the parents who bail them out,” says Bechtold. “Every family I deal with, I say, ‘Quit giving the kid money!’ And Mom says, ‘Oh, I’m not ready to do that yet.’” Bechtold says these things not to shame her clients, but to name the preconditions that make them targets. They’ve grown up immersed “in a stew of ads” from the Big Two betting apps; been chased across the web by their pings and promotions; and been told by the celebrities they trust most to think that betting’s how winners have fun. It normalizes gambling as “something cool to do with your friends,” she says. Now layer on the male-skewing lubricant of sports, and you’ve built “a mass addiction machine,” says Matt Gaskell, the clinical lead for the NHS Northern Gambling Service in England. “These companies engineered a product that exploits the reward pathways” of young brains. “The constant crackle of dopamine keeps them playing” — and then a big bump, equivalent to a “spike of heroin,” is triggered by “a win on their team.” Eventually, though, the wins and losses cease to matter. What keeps these kids in action is “that neurochemical feed that fires the desire centers in the brain.” Gaskell’s had a decade-plus jump on his peers: Britain legalized mobile sports bets in 2005. The fallout has been tragic. “We have an estimated one to two suicides a day in England, and many of the ones I know of are of young men from middle-class families with university training” he says. Rather than confront the SBOs by slapping limits on their ads and promos — “our kids see 1,600 gambling logos in a 90-minute [soccer] match onscreen,” says Gaskell — the British government lamely lists “gambling disorder” as an official cause of death. “This industry has captured our policymakers with its billions, as I expect it’s done with yours. So the warning from over here is, expect disaster.” EVER WONDER WHAT LIFE’S LIKE with a serpent on your shoulder, whispering in your ear to bet the Braves? For Andrew, the ex-third baseman in college, that forked-tongue enticer gave him no quarter, hissing Check the bonus! at 6 a.m. “Between the voice in my head and the texts from the sportsbooks, I wasn’t really sleeping a whole lot,” he says in his honey-maple drawl from the Carolinas. “Every night, I’d tell myself, ‘That’s your last bet.’ Then every morning, I’d get up, see the bonus on my phone, and bet double what I did the day before.” He’s calling from his flat in eastern Pennsylvania, a bachelor pad he’s put through the wringer. There are gashes in the walls he’s just getting around to fixing: holes he made throwing weights and plates after losing thousands of dollars in three hours. “I’ve never hit anyone in my life,” he says. “But I’ve got a hell of an arm.” Between September of 2020, when he moved up from Atlanta to join the mother of his unborn twins in Pennsylvania, and May of 2024, when he placed his last wager, he bet more than a million dollars, he says, on live, long-shot parlays and props. He’s not sure how much of that was lost on the apps, but concedes it was “a lot.” A study by the National Council on Problem Gambling found that betting on campus had surged to 75 percent — and that six percent of students were addicted to gambling, or nearly double the national average He says he stole cash from his parents on visits home to Greenville, and guilted them into stopgap loans he knew he’d never repay. On blue-sky weeks when he won more than he lost, he’d go out and buy himself something he cherished — a new titanium driver; a pricey pair of Jordans — then sell them on for half when he went bust. “I’d walk around my place whenever I hit zero, seeing everything I owned as dollar signs.” His beloved baseball glove; the cashmere quarter-zips his grandma bought him for Christmas — anything to raise a hundred bucks and feed the addiction. Andrew got addicted to betting in college, playing — and hitting — his first-ever backdoor cover. “I had Duke in March Madness, and was just about to lose,” he recalls. But then a ref blew the whistle as the buzzer sounded, giving Duke two meaningless free throws while up by four. With a make on the second, Duke won by five, miraculously beating the spread of 4 1/2, per Andrew’s telling. His brain went kablooey on dopamine. “I can’t even describe it — it was the best feeling ever. I thought it was gonna work like that all the time.” Gambling experts talk about the “first-win trap” — a neurochemical surge that swamps the pleasure center, sparking delirium only matched by high-test heroin. “The reward’s beyond anything in our day-to-day lives,” says Gaskell. “It’s literally off the scale we see in” brain scans. “There’s a reason we call gambling a substance disorder,” says Levant. “But the substance isn’t the dough — it’s the dopa.” Andrew gave up baseball, got a degree in health fitness, and earned a good living as a trainer in Atlanta. He was constantly in the hole, though, laying a dozen bets a day with the bookies or the offshore apps. Then he met a girl and moved her into his place. Months later, she was pregnant with their twins. “She’d no idea I gambled; no one did, till finally my parents caught on.” That’s the core difference between gamblers and other addicts. There’s nothing physical that gives them away: no unexplained weight loss; no cocktail-hour slurring. That secrecy, born of shame, can destroy a spouse and family. They don’t find out that their loved one’s stolen from them till the marshals are at the door with eviction papers. In 2023, the Public Health Advocacy Institute filed a class-action consumer-fraud lawsuit against DraftKings. A judge rejected the company’s motion to dismiss. Mark Cunningham/MLB Photos/Getty Images For every person hiding a gambling disorder, six people in their orbit are impacted financially, according to the World Health Organization. The collateral impacts of new gambling addictions are just now being charted by clinicians. Among states that have legalized sports-bet apps, bankruptcies are up by 30,000 a year, per a USC-UCLA study still in progress. A second study, from Northwestern, found that eight percent of the households in legal-gambling states were wagering on SBOs — and that every dollar spent on those apps cost households double in net-worth losses. And so states that took the bait of new-tax windfalls find themselves in a hole. Who’s going to cover the living expenses of families ruined by problem bettors? And who’s going to pay for those bettors’ treatment when, or if, they seek help? (Less than 10 percent of gambling addicts ever come in for counseling, per the National Council on Problem Gambling.) Of all the grim ephemera linked to legal gambling, this fact might be the starkest: For every dollar paid in taxes by SBOs, the states spend, on average, .0009 cents providing therapy for the addicts they’ve helped create, according to theNCPG . WHAT’S A YOUNG MAN TO DO when all the outlets he watches — ESPN, Paramount+, Peacock, Fox Sports — either own or have partnered with a sportsbook? When FanDuel and DraftKings push him their bet boosts while he’s scrolling reels? When SportsCenter plates him up a side of “Bad Beats” to pair with its “Top Ten Plays”? The effect of all that noise is to sell a tautology: that gambling is harmless fun when done in measure. It’s both the message and the method of the SBOs, who affix their buzzwords — “responsible gaming,” or RG — to the toe plate in all their ads. I called their collective trade rep, the American Gaming Association, to get a sense of RG in practice. Joe Maloney, a senior vice president, explained it to me — after expressing shock that kids use the apps. “The prevailing legal age for wagering is 21,” he told me. “We verify identities, we verify ages — and if a parent is opening [an account] for the use of a minor, that’s a violation of our terms of service. And if it’s found to have been done, then those individuals are banned from having accounts at these sites.” “If there’s college kids jumping out of windows now, we need to see those accounts to figure out why. We have a moral obligation to those kids and their families. Otherwise, we’ll lose a generation.” I granted the point, and pressed him about RG. Maloney was just getting warm, however. “We have a code of conduct that includes not casting anyone under 21 in our ads, and ensuring that the known audience of paid advertising is believed to be above 73 percent 21 [or older],” he told me. “We ban all university partnerships. We ban all agreements with NIL [Name, Image and Likeness] athletes. There’s no leafletting and pamphlet dropping on college campuses. None of those things are permitted.” He went on like this for 15 minutes, laying out the Four Pillars of RG. “Stick to a budget. Bet legally [i.e., on their apps, not offshore sites]. Know the odds. And keep it fun. Do it in the company of others,” said Maloney. “This is not a wealth-creation exercise [or] an investment vehicle. This is entertainment.” Since grade school, we’ve been trained to blame the addict for addiction: a failure of will and want-to in the weak. Even when the truth emerges, we still default to that warhorse, character, as the root of personal ruin. It’s only when the operators are forced to pay out fortunes that we finally fault the poisoner, not the poisoned. Hundreds of billions recovered from the tobacco companies, not counting the giant verdicts they keep losing. More than seven billion from the Sackler family. In America, the facts must defer to the funds. Our justice is a giant cardboard check. No one knows that lesson better than Dick Daynard, the godfather of tobacco litigation. A Harvard-trained lawyer, he founded a pivotal nonprofit, the Tobacco Products Liability Project, as a young attorney in the Eighties. TPLP became the tip line and database for the lawyers, reporters, and confidential sources who finally beat Big Tobacco in the mid- to late-Nineties. We’re sitting at a table in his offices in Boston, a quarter or so mile from Fenway Park. Joining us is Mark Gottlieb, Daynard’s voluble chief of staff, and the jet-lagged Harry Levant, just back from two symposia in Colorado. It was Levant who approached Daynard with his next crusade: suing the SBOs for the harms done to their users. Daynard, a laconic sort who wouldn’t order a hot dog without due process, tasked his staff to study the matter closely. “The doom loop of addiction?” says Gottlieb. “The losses that last till the customer drops? It wasn’t a tough decision to go forward.” Harry Levant is a longtime foe of the SBOs: “Among the dangers of celebrity endorsements is the normalization of an addictive product.” Thato Dadson/Courtesy of Harry Levant Through TPLP’s successor, the Public Health Advocacy Institute, Daynard’s team brought the first sports-bet lawsuit in Massachusetts in 2023. They picked DraftKings as their opening-round opponent. The complaint they filed was a strategic one: a tautly focused claim of consumer fraud. “Plaintiffs allege that the offer of the $1,000 bonus … was and is unfair and deceptive because, among other things, a new customer would, in order to get a $1,000 bonus, actually need to deposit five times that amount and then, within 90 days, place $25,000 in bets with only certain odds of return,” the suit reads. “In other words, the ‘$1,000 Bonus’ is structured so that it is inordinately expensive to obtain $1,000, and the new user is, instead, statistically likely to lose money by chasing the bonus.” “In what world would anyone call that ‘responsible gaming’?”  Daynard says. He filed the case, a class action, in Massachusetts, a state with stringent consumer-protection laws. DraftKings, for its part, filed a motion to dismiss. Its argument? “No reasonable consumer would have understood the Promotion in the terms that Plaintiffs allege.” That pleading was roundly denied by the judge; last summer, the case proceeded to discovery. Barring a settlement, the case heads to trial in two years. Meantime, Daynard’s colleagues are scouring DraftKings’ files, combing through tranches of court-compelled data to see if they can prove that DraftKings’ allegedly fraudulent ads are “deceptive to its target customers,” per the suit. To be clear: Gottlieb et al. aren’t bucking for prohibition. Legal gambling is here to stay, and they’re … OK with that. “Abolishing it at this point is DOA; there’s too much critical mass to take it down,” says Levant, who recently moved to Boston as the gambling-policy director of PHAI. “All we ask for are common-sense changes to the way these outfits do business.” For a list of those changes, I spoke to John Keenan, a reformer in the Massachusetts Senate. Keenan’s seen this rodeo before: He chaired the Senate’s Joint Committee on Mental Health and Substance Abuse through the last two waves of the opioids crisis. “When you look at Purdue Pharma, what did they have? A new product they hawked relentlessly — and often falsely,” says Keenan. Same difference with Big Sports Bet, except “their marketing’s an onslaught: They’ve rewritten the book on selling addictive products.” So Keenan’s sponsored a bill called the Bettor Health Act. Besides raising the state-tax rate on SBOs from 20 to 51 percent, it would instantly ban all sports-bet ads during live, in-game broadcasts. Further, it would outlaw player props, i.e., a parlay on Steph Curry to hit more than four threes and exceed eight assists against the Lakers. (Keenan calls those bets “the crack cocaine” of gambling.) The bill would also slap affordability checks on the SBOs: “If [someone] bets more than $1,000 a day, the industry has to check [his] bank account” to be sure he can support that action, says Keenan. But maybe the best thing Keenan’s bill would do is force the apps to share their data with the state. “If there’s college kids jumping out of windows now, we need to see those accounts to figure out why. We have a moral obligation to those kids and their families. Otherwise, we’ll lose a generation.” IT’S BEEN MORE THAN A YEAR now since Andrew placed a bet — but he’ll be the first to admit he’s been here before. “I quit cold turkey in 2020,” he says, “when my girlfriend found out she was pregnant.” Months of sobriety later, he rented a U-Haul and trucked their joint possessions to Pennsylvania. But driving across the line into Delaware — the first state, by a nose, to approve the apps — Andrew was beset by FanDuel radio ads and billboards. That night, he opened an account, grabbed the welcome bonus, and promptly lost his mind for four years. “The guy I became — I don’t know who that was,” he says. Depressed and withdrawn, “always snapping at my girl; all I wanted to do was go and hide.” He holed up in the spare room of the place they’d rented, betting like he’d never bet in Georgia. “Those offshore apps — yeah, I liked my parlays, but they just had the basics,” meaning money line, point spread, over/under. But FanDuel? “FanDuel was fuckin’ Disneyland, man. You could build your own parlay off a thousand different props — and the crazier the props, the bigger the payout.” That, he hastens to add, is how to tell you’re an addict: “We only play the long shots. Longer, the better.” Seven months after the couple moved north, Andrew’s girlfriend left him and took their three-month-olds with her. Andrew hasn’t seen his kids, now four, since; he relinquished his parental rights during that four-year spiral, failing to appear at visitations. Though he’s stable enough now to send her child support, he hasn’t pushed his ex for visitation. “I have no moral ground to be in their lives,” he says. “I burned every bridge and ruined every trust with everyone I ever knew. At this point, it’s just about living my life and trying to prove I can do better.” Though we’re speaking by phone, I sense his mood straying, drawn to the shadows of the past. There’s a species of forgetting when you’ve lived apart, a gap that can’t be filled by stepping back into the world. Of all the sunk assets, faith is the dearest: faith that you still matter out there, and still share a language with other people. To reclaim that faith, Andrew’s gone public with his story, telling it to anyone who’ll listen. He’s appeared, under his own name, on CNN and CBS; spent hours on the phone with me to be sure I get it all; and made himself available to the people he hurt, giving a ruthless accounting of his sins. He has no expectation that the truth will set him free, or serve as recompense for the past. “I’m just putting this out there [in hopes] that someone hears it and does something before a bunch of people die. The way these companies play you, chase and harass you till you’re worse than broke and get to thinking, ‘Maybe it would be better if I was gone.’”",https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-features/mobile-sports-betting-gambling-addiction-fanduel-draftkings-1235444172,Entertainment,BBC,"Paul Solotaroff,Eli Senor",https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/bet-the-devil-LEAD.jpg?crop=0px%2C1697px%2C1800px%2C1014px&resize=1600%2C900,2025-10-12T13:00:00+00:00,2eec81bda5622269601c6dcb02515557adfd2b80
4aec03e0ed9c,What You Tell an AI Chatbot Could One Day Be Evidence in a Criminal Trial,,"On Wednesday, the Department of Justice announced the arrest of Jonathan Rinderknecht, who was federally charged for setting the blaze that eventually became the massive and deadly Palisades Fire, which ravaged coastal communities of Los Angeles County throughout the month of January. Authorities mentioned various pieces of evidence that they said supported the case against Rinderknecht, but they spotlighted a particularly novel one : records of his exchanges with ChatGPT . The 29-year-old Florida man allegedly prompted OpenAI ‘s chatbot to create images of cities and forests engulfed in flames, told it about feeling “liberated” after burning a Bible, and, shortly after igniting a brush fire just after midnight on New Year’s Day, asked it, “Are you at fault if a fire is lift [sic] because of your cigarettes?” Rinderknecht has yet to enter a plea, but if he goes to trial, the case could offer a meaningful glimpse into how the proliferation of AI technology will affect criminal investigations and prosecutions in the future. Users have proven overly trustful of chatbots, treating them as therapists, confidants, and even romantic partners onto which they can unburden intimate secrets. The reality is that they are divulging sensitive information on platforms that offer no legal confidentiality, developed by companies that will readily turn their data over to law enforcement if served with a subpoena, warrant, or court order. A New Frontier All this makes chatbot records a potential bonanza for law enforcement, tech and legal experts tell Rolling Stone , perhaps more valuable than the text messages and social media footprints that currently serve as important areas of focus when authorities scrutinize individuals linked to a crime . Generative AI correspondence, too, is soon to be a regular part of criminal investigations and trials. “There is no doubt that AI chatbot logs are going to take center stage in evidentiary disputes across the nation,” says Kyle A. Valente, an attorney with the law firm Bressler Amery & Ross PC who published a paper on the topic last month. “Civil practitioners will want to obtain chat histories to show intent or motive in cases dealing with fraud, misrepresentation, breach of contract, and the like,” he says, while prosecutors are seeking to introduce these files to establish elements of a case such as mens rea , or a suspect’s knowledge of wrongdoing. Though a number of civil lawsuits related to user harm are currently pending against AI firms, criminal prosecutors have hardly begun to explore how they can leverage defendants’ chatbot usage to secure convictions. Valente cites one remarkable early precedent: a man from Roanoke, Virginia, was sentenced in September to 25 years in prison for first-degree murder after prosecutors argued that his messages with Snapchat ‘s My AI bot demonstrated premeditation in a 2023 slaying. Before fatally shooting another man in a petty dispute, the now convicted defendant, 18 years old at the time, told the bot he was going to “fight” and asked it, “What if I shot them if they step on my property with hostile intent?” (The chatbot replied that it could not “condone or encourage any violent or illegal behavior.”) ‘It’s Like Your Diary Times 10’ “DNA residue, fingerprints, everything you watch in all these crime shows pales in comparison to the private data that you have on your phone,” says Rob T. Lee, a digital forensics and AI expert at SANS Institute, a cybersecurity training cooperative. “What happens now with AI, you’re having a full conversation with these chatbots. It is no longer just a search for a topic.” Whereas criminal suspects in this past may have been incriminated by a Google query on, say, how to clean up bloodstains, a more comprehensive, detailed back-and-forth with a tool like ChatGPT gives investigators far more opportunities to prove intent and mindset, Lee explains. “All of that is logged, and it’s all sitting on servers,” he says. “It’s like your diary times 10.” “We saw this with social media, where all of a sudden, law enforcement started to understand that a lot of important, relevant evidence could be gleaned from social media posts and profiles,” says Meetali Jain, a tech and human rights lawyer who serves as director of the Tech Justice Law Project and is representing multiple parents in lawsuits alleging that AI products encouraged their children to commit suicide. “That became a standard part of a criminal investigation. I think we’re going to start to see that in this context too.” The difference, she says, is that this next development concerns “machine-generated outputs,” and there aren’t established rules around how this kind of material can or should be admitted as exhibits in court. “It’s very much a live issue,” Jain says. Valente concurs: “At this early juncture, the bounds are limitless until such a time as courts issue opinions that establish some framework for dealing with this type of evidence,” he says. A Fundamental Difference Vincent Conitzer, director of the Foundations of Cooperative AI Lab at Carnegie Mellon University and head of technical AI engagement at the University of Oxford’s Institute for Ethics in AI, also says that chatbot exchanges fundamentally differ from text messages with another person, who we would expect to take action to prevent a crime if told about it in advance. “Will we have similar expectations of a chatbot?” Conitzer asks. “Already the companies try to have guardrails so that their chatbots do not help someone commit a crime, though those guardrails are still very brittle.” Indeed, an NBC News report this week revealed that ChatGPT can be manipulated into giving directions on the assembly of chemical and biological weapons. And Matthew Livelsberger, the veteran who on New Year’s Day fatally shot himself in a Tesla Cybertruck parked in front of the Trump hotel in Las Vegas right before an incendiary device blew up the vehicle, used generative AI to help plan his attack. Lee notes that several AI companies have already indicated their ability to flag user activity that appears to foreshadow a crime. “They’re getting much better at detecting foreign adversaries using these systems for malicious ends, and I can only imagine that they’re doing similar for people [in the U.S.] that may be looking to kill or commit acts of terror,” he says. Human Review OpenAI has said it employs a human review team that is authorized to electively inform law enforcement when they come across content that “involves an imminent threat of serious physical harm to others.” How often they escalate to this level of alarm is unclear. “They’re not doing press releases on it,” Lee says, speculating that they prefer to spotlight efforts to disrupt state-affiliated threat actors in Russia, Iran, and China, “which is much easier to get a pat on the back for.” The major American AI players are much more tight-lipped, Lee says, on their ability to detect a possible school shooter, to take one example. And, as Jain points out, if they are picking up these warning signs, reporting them isn’t mandatory. “I think [the companies] are going to say, ‘Look, we can’t be responsible for what kinds of queries users pose to us through our chatbot, we can’t possibly know what he was going to do,’” Jain predicts. She is struck by the fact that when the Justice Department put forward its claims about how Rinderknecht had used ChatGPT before and during the Palisades Fire, they didn’t mention OpenAI or whether the program could have appeared to encourage “harm to others.” Chatbots are known to validate users’ obsessions and delusions , and most of the litigation around this phenomenon has so far pertained to self-harm, as in the suits Jain has brought against OpenAI and Character Technologies. The question of the role a chatbot might come to play in an episode of outward violence or destructive behavior is murkier still. “​​The focus is going to be on further substantiating the culpability of the individual, at the expense of really looking at how the companies designed their chatbots,” Jain says, likening the issue to entrapment, a scenario in which law enforcement induces someone to commit a crime. She envisions prosecutors homing in on a “gotcha moment” in a defendant’s chatbot logs, “without any sort of understanding of how the machine got to that output.” “I feel like it’s going to be a very one-sided story,” Jain adds. “I can’t imagine that a company is going to stick up for the rights of users.” Nevertheless, it seems there’s little the major AI players can do to avoid being drawn into criminal proceedings in the months and years ahead. Valente, for one, expects that their legal and compliance departments will take a “proactive” approach to the problem. What would that entail? “Revisiting privacy policies and updating terms and conditions,” he says. As always, the devil is in the fine print.",https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-features/chatbot-history-evidence-criminal-case-1235444944,Entertainment,BBC,Miles Klee,https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/ai-chatbot-logs-in-court.jpg?w=1600&h=900&crop=1,2025-10-11T14:54:26+00:00,4f82ed3df8908158028a9105a09b133a9ce160f8
a4ae316a5b1b,"Her Father Was a Notorious Serial Killer. Years After His Arrest, She’s Still Searching for Answers",,"For almost 30 years, the city of Wichita, Kansas was terrorized by a serial killer. He called himself BTK , a nickname patterned after the phrase “bind, torture, kill” — the signature way he would leave bodies for police to find. His victims varied, first a young family, then women of varying ages and economic backgrounds — sometimes going years between murders. Investigators were assigned and reassigned to the case, poring over clues and evidence. These included letters from BTK himself, taunting police on being unable to catch him. By 2005, BTK was considered one of the biggest cold cases in the entire state. Kerri Rawson — who had grown up in Wichita — was living in Michigan but hadn’t forgotten the moniker of the wanted murder. But when FBI agents showed up to her door on a snowy morning that February she couldn’t reconcile her knowledge of the serial killer with what the people in front of her were saying. BTK wasn’t a cold case anymore. A suspect had just been arrested, and it was her father, Dennis Rader. In June 2005, Rader pleaded guilty to 10 counts of first degree murder. He is incarcerated in the El Dorado Correctional Facility in El Dorado, Kansas , serving 10 consecutive life sentences. But for Rawson, her father’s secret double life — a religious family man in public and a sadistic serial killer in private — has haunted her since the police’s discovery. Now, she’s trying to reckon the man she knew with the murderer she despises. In the new Netflix documentary My Father, the BTK Killer, the investigators, media, neighbors walk through their memories of the search for BTK — all while Rawson tries to plan out what her future looks like without him. Here are four things we learned from the new Netflix documentary My Father, the BTK Killer . Stephen King’s interview about his book A Good Marriage inspired Kerri Rawson to break her family’s year long silence . Even after the FBI informed Rawson of her father’s arrest and history as a serial killer, there was a part of the Kansas native that didn’t believe her father could have done it. While reckoning with the news, neither Rawson nor her mother believed that police had the right person. Following the media storm, Rawson says in the documentary that she turned down major interviews with people like Diane Sawyer and Oprah. “I spent almost 10 years rotting inside after he was arrested. Not being able to speak, not thinking I was allowed to speak,” she says in the documentary. “In the Midwest code, you don’t ever air your dirty laundry publicly. You just keep it inside and you look appropriate on the outside.” But one night, while she was watching television, Rawson caught a 2014 interview with thriller author Stephen King . King was promoting his novella A Good Marriage , about a happy wife whose life is thrown into disarray when she discovers her husband is secretly a serial killer. King said he was inspired in part by Rader’s arrest, more specifically, by his ability to keep his murderous tendencies completely unknown to the rest of his family. Rawson felt like the book was exploitative of her father’s victims, and decided that it was finally time for her to share her own perspective. “I had been silent for so long,” she says. “And there was so much stuff that needed to come out.” Rader was known in his community as a kind and quiet man, but his family said he had a vicious temper. One of the biggest shocks after Rader’s arrest was how long the convicted killer was able to plan and execute serial killings in his own community without being arrested or even suspected. People in his community of Park City, Kansas — a small town outside Wichita — remembered Rader as a quiet, kind, and rule-following man. He worked as a compliance officer for the city, and was known by many people as the official dogcatcher. In addition to being a stickler for city ordinances, Rader was known to participate heavily in outside activities like leading his son’s Cub Scout group and doing administrative tasks at the Christ Lutheran Church. “He didn’t just fool his family,” family friend and neighbor Andrea Rogers says in the documentary. “He fooled a church. He fooled an entire city. He literally fooled everybody.” But even before his family was told about his extracurriculars, Rawson says that she, her mother, and brother were all aware that her father had an angry personality that the rest of the world couldn’t see. In the documentary, Rawson says that the family often left Rader choose everything from their activities to the movies they watched to where the children went in their free time, for fear of upsetting him. And they also knew that even the smallest of mistakes, like leaving their shoes out or someone taking his assigned seat at the kitchen table, could result in massive outbursts. “My father, on the outside, looked like a very well-behaved, mild-mannered man. But there’s these moments of Dad, [where] something will trigger him and he can flip on a dime,” Rawson says in the documentary. “And it can be dangerous.” Rader often used his family life as a cover for his murders . When police interviewed him following his arrest, Rader admitted that he used his family events as helpful cover for his murders, but noted that his busy schedule most likely kept him from killing more people. Though none of his family say they had any idea he was a serial killer, the clues were hidden in plain sight. When police first searched Rader’s house, they found his kill bag — a bag complete with a gun, ropes, and other break-in items — stored prominently in the entryway’s coat closet. In Rader’s office, evidence of his kills including personal items belonging to the victims, were kept accessible in an unlocked filing cabinet. Rader and his family were active and often took vacations and trips in popular tourist destinations like the Grand Canyon and the National Parks . They were also avid fishers, campers, and hikers, with Rawson noting she and her father both loved the outdoors. “He said later on that having kids slowed down his murders,” Rawson says in the documentary. “Dad said he got busy raising kids. I think he got busy chasing me.” One of the last letters of clues Rader sent police before his longest hiatus was mailed on the night of Rawson’s first birthday party. But many of those activities also helped Rader avoid initial suspicion in the murders. On Jan. 18, 1991, Rader went to a  Cub Scout event before sneaking away to kill 62-year-old Dolores Davis. After using his station wagon to store bodies and murder gear, he later gave it to Rawson in high school for her own personal use. “That was not okay,” Rawson says. Rawson helped police name Rader as the suspect for at least one additional murder . After Rawson learned that her father was the BTK killer, she says in the documentary that she went through a very long period of emotional upheaval. Days after Rader’s arrest, she and a large group of her extended family gathered in the same house, eating food and telling stories about their treasured memories while the media circus continued to swarm outside. Rawson says it was like a funeral but she still loved her father. Instead, she focused her anger on the media attention and people who were hounding her family. “Our lives were just gone,” she says in the documentary. “It was upheaval, totally insane. I was just mad at everybody.” After her father was convicted, Rawson reached out to him in prison and tried to continue some aspect of their relationship, letting him know she was always available to talk but that she desperately wanted answers. He didn’t answer her questions, but he did say he loved her and thought of her. Since Rawson and Rader had an open line of communication, police asked Rawson to aid them in finding if there were any more victims then the 10 he had claimed.  Rawson not only went through Rader’s personal notes and diaries, but met with him and asked him point blank about the possibility of other victims. Rader denied being involved. After going through his notes and personal belongings, police named Rader as the prime suspect in the 1976 disappearance of one other woman: 16-year-old Cynthia Kinney from Pawhuska, Oklahoma. Kinney was working at a laundromat when she went missing, a fantasy detailed extensively in one of Rader’s journals. Police have never found Kinney’s body, so any conviction would require stronger evidence linking Rader with Kinney. Rader still denies it. Rawson says she can’t reconcile her father with BTK — and she’s done trying to . According to Rawson, the Kansas native has spent much of her adult life trying to cope with the trauma of learning her father’s real nature. For a while, this was alleviated by trying to help police with their investigations, corresponding with her father, and working with organizations meant to help victims of violent and high profile crimes. In 2019, she wrote A Serial Killer’s Daughter: My Story of Faith, Love, and Overcoming , her first memoir. Her second, Breaking Free: Overcoming the Trauma of My Serial Killer Father , was published in 2023. Both of the books were national best sellers. But even after helping the police and victims advocacy groups, Rawson says she still struggled with her own repressed memories from her childhood. In the documentary, she describes having a period of night terrors and fearful periods where she was constantly paranoid of a home invasion. These lasted for months, often resulting in her wetting the bed and crying out for help. Now, Rawson thinks part of that may have been her somehow understanding her father’s actions. “I think my subconscious [has been] trying to get it out of me since I was a little girl,” she says. “Saying, ‘Hey, there’s a bad man in my house.’” Rader kept detailed notes about his victims and killings, but many of them were interspersed among writings about daydreams and fantasies. In one of his notebooks, Rawson found her own name next to a date and his codes for bondage and sex. Rawson confronted her father during a visit to his prison. He denied ever sexually assaulting her or any member of her family — saying he only fantasized about it — but Rawson says she exploded. She berated him about how intertwined his serial killing life and her life were. And when she was done, she left. She says the person sitting across from her at that table wasn’t a father she recognized. So she’s done spending so much time trying to make sense of why her father committed his crimes. Rawson says that she will always continue her work with victim advocacy groups, but for now, she’s exploring what her life, memories, and career look like without her father or his impact. At 80 years old, Rader is still serving consecutive life sentences and will never be released. Rawson doubts she will ever visit him again. “I’ll grieve those memories and that girl and that family. I lost all of it,” she says. “But I just didn’t really want to give him any of me anymore.”",https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-news/kerri-rawson-my-father-btk-serial-killer-kansas-documentary-1235443801,Entertainment,BBC,CT Jones,https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/My_Father_The_BTK_Killer.jpg?w=1600&h=900&crop=1,2025-10-11T14:30:00+00:00,223000a1e29f13b60d46c7cb7b230bded6837439
829c9f4048a8,Allen Iverson on Chilling With Biggie and Getting Way Too High,,"In the following excerpt from Misunderstood : A Memoir , NBA Hall of Famer Allen Iverson recounts how he wrestled with success, fame, and lofty expectations during his rookie season with the Philadelphia 76ers — while also enjoying the hell out of his rising celebrity. I was back in Cleveland for our first game after the All-Star Break. I had vowed I would show that crowd what’s up after they booed me. But I had a terrible game, and they booed me again. I hated the Cleveland fans at that point. That’s how it went for a little while — losses, negativity. For the first time in my life, it almost felt like I had lost my legs. I shot the ball terribly. I tried to distribute, but my teammates weren’t making anything either. It was like we had reentered that period where we lost 23 out of 24. The Sixers fans were getting pissed off at the losing too. The negative stories about me continued. I held a little press gathering a few days later, at a Reebok event, trying to turn the narrative around. I told these guys the same story, that I respected the legends who came before me. But then they switched it up and started asking me about rumors that I owned a gun in my name. I told them that I did, and that I had to protect myself. With that as the new focal point, it became more of Allen Iverson is a bad guy but add guns to the mix. Feeling like talking just made it worse, I told the media I was done with that shit. No more press availability. I remember a couple days later, after we won one against the Clippers, Pat Croce came up to me in the arena, and he was like, Chuck, you got to talk to these guys. So I agreed to do it, but I took one from the Coach Thompson playbook and said I would only answer questions about basketball. And that’s how I handled it for the rest of the season. It wasn’t just me feeling the heat. Johnny Davis’s job was rumored to be in trouble, and as the trade deadline approached, I think some dudes were actually hoping to get traded. All this shit hurt, but my life kept on being this dream. Reebok officially released The Question. The authentic me was front and center in the marketing campaign. Of course all my family and friends were wearing them. I wore them on the court for the rookie game, the red, white, and blue matching my Sixers uniform. Seeing them like that — on my feet, family and friends wearing them — was one thing, but I will never forget witnessing them out in the world for the first time. I was in my car, and a kid had the joints on. Just walking down the city streets. After I passed him in my car, I stopped and put the motherfucker in park. I just kept it there as I looked at the kid in my rearview. Kept my eyes on him until he walked out of sight. It might as well have been me I was looking at. Here I was, exactly a year removed from driving that first Mercedes off the lot. Three years removed from jail. Not even seven years removed from walking up to Bethel High, just hoping my name was on the list. Seven years removed from hustling. Eight, maybe nine years removed from swiping worms from the corner store and lifting loose change from cars in the mall parking lot. Here I was, in my Benz or my Rolls or whatever it was that day, watching my shoes accompanying this anonymous kid down the city streets. In spite of all the losing that season, I was loving my life. Makes me think of a conversation I had with my mom — years later, but I think about it a lot. I said to her, “I’m getting scared.” And she was like, “About what?” I said, “Everything is perfect right now. As good as it could be.” “What do you mean?” So I tried to explain it. “You know, I been with Tawanna, shit, my whole fucking life. If her day ain’t good, my day ain’t good. Everything is great with us, my kids are doing fine, my family is fine. All the money we have coming in. Everything is cool. But I’m scared.” “That don’t make no sense.” “Everything just seems too goddamn perfect. I feel like something bad is going to happen.” She just said, “Don’t you ever live your life like that. That’s a blessing, man, God is blessing you, that’s a part of being blessed: things going well in your life. Don’t get scared of that, don’t fucking jinx yourself to where something bad gotta be happening or feel like you got used to bad shit happening in life. You know, life is supposed to be fucking great. I know life is hard at times. But when it’s going good, that’s a blessing. It don’t always have to be bad.” So I always tried to enjoy the good times. But I admit, I was never confident they would continue. That’s one reason I think I played like I did, and maybe why I partied that way too. Like you never know how long it’s going to last. It seemed like it wasn’t supposed to happen in the first place. The Reebok Questions got released as planned, but they were hard to get your hands on at first. Everybody wanted them. I will never forget when I was in LA, and after a game, I heard I had a visitor. Came out the locker room, and there he was. Biggie. I was just like, “What the fuck you doing here?” He went, “I came to see you. I need to get me the Questions.” I had to act cool, having this idol waiting for me, to ask me for something. I was like, “I got you.” Then we chilled that night. And I made sure we sent them kicks, obviously. Man, when I got to the league, it was like a world opened up to me. When I tell you that I was going out with my friends to clubs, out late into the night, many times it wasn’t just us. I was chilling with the dudes I idolized, who, like I said, provided the soundtrack of my life. It started before the draft even. I had gone to hoop at Rucker Park, in Harlem, because you had to play there back then. You weren’t the real shit unless you did. When I showed up, all kinds of people came to see the show. That’s when I first met Biggie and Lil’ Cease from Junior M.A.F.I.A., dudes who’d already done exactly what we were dreaming of doing, conquering, getting rich, and bringing everyone with them. They’d made records. I was playing basketball. So after that with Biggie, we’d chill when I was in New York, or when he was in the same city I happened to be in. One night earlier that year, when I was in New York, me and some of my friends were invited to his recording studio. It’s one of those times it felt like I was dreaming. Everyone was smoking, chilling. At that particular point, I only smoked here and there, and even then, I only started from when I was at Georgetown. So I smoked a little that night, but then I started tripping. I remember I went to the bathroom, and I was wearing this Janet Jackson shirt, and the reflection just started freaking me out. Then I couldn’t find my way back down the hallway to the recording studio. Turned out what I smoked was some fucking hash. I really didn’t know what I was doing. So eventually I made it back after some worker found my ass and took me. Me and Ra and E were just sitting there, tripping, as we watched Biggie work on a couple tracks from Life After Death . At that point, it had been a minute since his last release, so this was going to be his next big one. That night, Biggie recorded parts of “You’re Nobody (Til Somebody Kills You)” and “My Downfall.” Ra and E were imagining making it in that world. I was just a fan watching this genius work, man. Flash forward to March 9, about a month after the All-Star Game, and we had a game in Washington. My mom came to DC to watch my homecoming. Remember, I had missed our first game in DC earlier that year, so now I got to play in front of everyone — the USAir Arena was as close as any NBA basketball arena was to Newport News and Hampton. My mom stayed in my hotel. I went out that night until late. After I had gotten to bed, my mom came and woke my ass up. “They killed your man!” I didn’t know what she was talking about. “Biggie dead.” I got up, shook. I had watched him record, gotten him my shoes. He’d been a model for us as we’d plotted getting out the shit. It was crushing. If anyone had been prepared for death, it was me. From all the dudes I’d seen get killed, Tony Clark and too many others to count, it’s fucked-up to say I was used to it. But I was used to it. Still, when you get the fuck out, like I did, and like Biggie had done before me, and it still goes that way? I thought about that shit all the time after that. And I always remembered when I was a kid, in Glen Gardens, with a barrel pressed to my head. Right before he died, they released “Hypnotize,” the first single off Ready to Die . Then at the end of that month, after his death, the “Hypnotize” video came out. It was so fucking epic, filmed with speedboats and helicopters in Miami Bay. The man had made it, was doing it over the top, just crushing it. Before it all got snatched away. They said he never got to watch the whole video. He definitely never got to see the whole album released. But if you watch that video close, you can see it. He’s wearing the motherfucking Questions.

d5dd7f80877b,‘Battlefield 6’ Is a Throwback Military Fantasy That’s Smart Enough to Play Dumb,,"Brooklyn’s on fire . The intermittent pops of muzzle fire are drowned out as tank treads grind the asphalt down Washington Street toward the East River waterfront, where a 100-year-old carousel lays in ruin. As U.S. forces lay waste to the tourist spots and halal trucks in a deadly skirmish with a fictional paramilitary cell, you can’t help but wince in horror. Thankfully, the scene isn’t something pulled from the daily news, even if it’s nightmarishly close to a future many Americans fear. Instead, the violent upheaval of New York City is just one of the backdrops for EA’s Battlefield 6 (out Oct. 10), where 64 players are competing to be king of the hill in a shockingly realistic first-person shooter. The phrase “realistic” is a little loaded; the sequences depicted aren’t exactly what anyone’s really expecting to see anytime soon. But they still hit close to home, and the heavy plodding of infantry and the high-tech physics of crumbling buildings make everything feel about as real as can be. While other games are trading in cartoonish action and power fantasy, Battlefield 6 ’s harrowing gameplay feels like a back-to-the-basics approach, even if it’s still this over the top. After taking a backseat to the juggernaut success of competitor Call of Duty for the last decade or so, Battlefield is back as arguably the most-anticipated military shooter of 2025. And with a pretty solid single-player campaign and best-in-class multiplayer mode that makes the horrors of war into a digestibly addictive romp, Battlefield 6 is a welcome sight, even if it frequently makes you want to close your eyes. Obama-era military machismo Although it’s tried many times over the years with sub-series like Bad Company , single-player story campaigns have never really been Battlefield ’s forte. The newest one isn’t revolutionary by any means; it’s mostly an excuse to show off high-fidelity, on-rails versions of locations used in multiplayer maps for some neat action set pieces. The paper-thin plot follows a group of U.S. Marines as they bounce around the world aiming to thwart the terrorism of a fictional private army called Pax Armata. The story is wall-to-wall clichés, with the playable bits serving as flashbacks to catch audiences up to the present, where the Marines are interrogating a shady government official about how the world went FUBAR. The core cast are forgettable, but the game pulls tricks from older-era Call of Duty titles like Modern Warfare and Black Ops by saddling players with alternating POVs of the events just long enough to learn someone’s name before you’re forced to live out their demise. Battlefield 6 ‘s character are one-dimensional stands-ins that get the job done. Electronic Arts Mechanically, most encounters are just a series of shooting galleries, which doesn’t really play to Battlefield ’s strengths. While some of the areas are relatively open, the forward momentum of the plot means there’s always a right and wrong way to go — although you’ll only find out which when an on-screen countdown yells to return to the combat zone. The level design occasionally takes inspiration from the multiplayer, where the solution to smoking out a sniper is usually to bring an entire building down. But often, it’s confusing in the main campaign. Players are told to clear out a three-story apartment, but basic rifle bullets are bringing the walls down around you, with unknown enemies appearing like a jump scare. The developers admirably tried to include the class system in the story, where each squad member serves a specific role like medic or engineer, but it mostly means that being shot will leave players laying around waiting for a somewhat dim AI partner to come revive them even while enemies are swarming the body. The speculative fiction plot remains politically neutral — there’s just good guys and bad ones. Electronic Arts The campaign is at its best when it’s showing off gorgeous destruction in scripted sequences. An early game HALO jump sees smoke and condensation caking on the player’s visor as they plummet in freefall toward a warzone in Gibraltar. Another has the squad sneaking through the alleyways of Cairo using night vision goggles while avoiding a protest that’s boiling over into a full-blown riot in the streets. The big selling point from the marketing materials is the Brooklyn-based mayhem that takes up a big chunk of the plot in the game’s first act. Bringing the battle home for players to storm brownstones in Brooklyn Heights or desperately traverse a crumbling Manhattan Bridge is effectively scary — for most people. Despite its very clearly apolitical speculative fiction slant, it’s hard not to see parallels between U.S. Armed Forces occupying a liberal city in a video game and what’s happening daily on CNN. The cognitive dissonance is handwaved by sticking the blame on a made-up, morally compromised private army, but it’s obvious that the experience works both ways regardless of your real-life political leaning. For a certain type of MAGA-minded American, tearing through Grand Army Plaza with a 50-cal is bound to be virtual Viagra. For others, it’s a too-close-to-home horror show, although with a healthy dose of NIMBYism — it’s a relief to jump back to Egypt or Iran to engage in the same level of wanton carnage on foreign soil that pop culture has desensitized. The deft trick is convincing you that, no matter why you like it, it’s okay because you’re the good guy. Domestic warfare leans into shock value, but is effective nonetheless. Electronic Arts At its peak, Battlefield 6 ’s story mode operates on the same wavelength as late-2000s military shooters, where morally gray acts of war are a dime a dozen, punctuated by the shock value of domestic threats played out with an immersive POV. Multi-level multiplayer mayhem Despite its surprisingly competent story campaign, the real draw of Battlefield is the multiplayer — and it’s rarely been better than in this new game. Stripping all the fat and gimmicks from recent entries like Battlefield 2024 (2021) and Battlefield 1 (2016), the gameplay style has gone back to emulate the design of the series’ best installments like Battlefield 3 and 4 (2011 and 2013). Since its earliest entries, the defining factor of Battlefield ’s competitive multiplayer has been its sheer scope. Originally 24, then 32, and now a 64-player assault on the senses, there’s really nothing else like what EA’s military shooter series offers. It’s an experience where users can start a match on foot, racing headfirst into a hailstorm of bullets, only to end up in a jeep, tank, or attack chopper raining fire on the roof of an apartment complex moments later. The single-player set pieces go big, but the multiplayer can match it. Electronic Arts The class-based system encourages teamwork; the only way to successfully take control of a designated zone is to throw bodies at it, but it’s easy to get cut down by sniper and artillery fire. The smartest way forward is to coordinate and play your role — whether that’s Assault, Engineer, Support, or Recon. Each class has its own unique abilities: Assault lets players run point with heavy firepower and improved mobility; Engineers can fix friendly vehicles or do extreme damage to the opposition’s; Support can resupply ammunition and revive fallen allies instantly; Recon allows players to spot and mark enemies for higher field visibility. Unlike Call of Duty , where everyone is essentially their own one-man Rambo, there’s more to Battlefield than just sprinting around endlessly killing foes. There is, of course, basic deathmatch, which is playable in both a classic two team setup or in smaller squads of four where the groups are all racing to rack up 50 kills for the win. But the real Battlefield experience is the tug-of-war around capturing locations in prolonged battles of attrition. Modes like Conquest, Breakthrough, and Domination are all different variations on this concept with minor tweaks to the ruleset that defines each one. Conquest is a large-scale skirmish where two teams fight to control different flagged points around the map (labeled A to F) where holding each point for an extended period dwindles the opposition’s score until it reaches zero. Domination is the same, except with less points to capture and smaller arenas for more hectic action. The modes aren’t that varied, but the core experience remains unparalleled. Electronic Arts Breakthrough is similar, but rather than having everyone on equal footing bouncing around points on loop, it’s a more direct attacker and defender scenario where one team pushes forward, and the other must hold the line. Rush mode is the same, but smaller, and focuses the push on destroying objectives rather than just flooding the areas to control them. While most of the multiplayer modes are different flavors of the same idea, there’s a perpetually improvisational element that makes Battlefield 6 shine where other shooters falter. If a team is failing to take a point because their infantry is being bottlenecked into doorway that becomes a kill box, you can always just remove the entire wall with an RPG. Suddenly, the levy’s broken and everyone can rush. While the slower speed and emphasis on physics, from the long-distance drop of bullet trajectories to the breakable foundations of structures, are a huge part of Battlefield ’s DNA, there’s also just an inherent silliness to some of the tactics that stir joy. Playing to your class strengths is the key to victory. Electronic Arts Playing as a Support medic means you can gain tons of experience and turn the tide of battle by just sprinting around a crash site defibrillating a dozen downed soldiers with a slap in the face, screaming, “On your feet, soldier!” As an engineer, it’s a thrill to ride shotgun in a helicopter just holding down the repair button as a simple blowtorch keeps the bird alive despite heavy fire turning its walls to Swiss cheese. It’s the balance of realism and gaminess that just neatly threads the needle. Nowadays, everyone’s got a gimmick. In the arms race for audience’s undivided attention, both single-player and competitive games have become their own self-perpetuating ecosystems. Everything is bigger, louder, and packed to the brim with pop culture IP skins just to get people to bite. By comparison, Battlefield 6 practically feels quaint. It’s an all-meat and potatoes action shooter that sticks to a 20-year-old playbook, both in how it plays and how it blindly sidesteps any real point of view on its amoral militaristic jingoism. With how overwhelming the noise in both gaming and reality has become, it’s a frankly welcome distraction. Battlefield 6 launches on Oct. 10 for PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC.",https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/rs-gaming/battlefield-6-review-1235443332,Entertainment,BBC,Christopher Cruz,https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/bf001.jpg?w=1600&h=900&crop=1,2025-10-09T15:01:27+00:00,cbedecf211d092ab4fc8045326aa6e34bb573a56
d819e20fb320,She Got a Terminal Diagnosis. She Turned TikTok Into Her Death Diary,,"It all started with calf tightness. When Brooke Eby started walking funny in 2018, she thought it was a muscle issue. A business development manager then in her early twenties, Brooke was healthy, exercised, and had a pretty average work-life balance. But when her limp became pronounced enough that friends started pointing it out, Eby thought it might be a good time to go to the doctor. What followed was years of doctors visits, tests, and absolutely no concrete answers. “They were throwing things at the wall,” Eby tells Rolling Stone . “One doctor mentioned polio. It was like I was on an episode of House . My whole family and I were like, ‘There’s no way it’s something serious. I probably just have a weird foot.’ In hindsight, we were kind of idiots about it.” Four years later, when Eby’s other foot started acting the same way, she and her family finally got their answer. She had ALS . Also commonly referred to as Lou Gehrig’s disease, ALS is a degenerative disease that impacts the motor neurons of the brain and spinal cords, with a life expectancy of  two to five years after symptoms first begin. The disease is rare, fatal, and according to Mayo Clinic , typically occurs in people aged 60 and older. Eby was 29. “I went home in a fugue state. I don’t really remember, but it involved eating a lot of M&Ms,” she says. “I was like that for almost two months until my friend’s wedding. I had to show up in front of all my college friends with the same walker as the bride’s grandma — same tennis balls on the bottom and everything. All my friends rallied around me, and we were laughing about it the whole time. That was when I was like, ‘I can still joke about this.’” In the three years since, Eby has combined her dark humor with posts about ALS awareness, building an audience a quarter-million strong on TikTok , where she shares the nitty gritty of life with ALS. For some people, activism looks like funding drives, serious speeches, and heartfelt appeals to people’s sensibilities. And while that’s certainly an aspect of Eby’s work, the creator likes to focus on a more frank approach to teaching people about the disease. Eby posts almost every day, with her videos spanning from medical tests charting her muscle and breathing decline to describing what it’s like to have your elderly parents become your full-time caretakers. But the through line in all of her content is using her personality to get people to think more about ALS. “You could read an infographic about how one in 400 people will get this disease, and you have two to five years to live, but that’s not something that tugs at the heart,” Eby says. “So I was like, ‘I’m just gonna do the ‘show don’t tell’ method.’ I remember at the beginning people being like, ‘You seem so happy,’ and I was like, ‘Just wait.’ This disease is not gonna stop just because I’m young and bubbly.” ALS has a long and storied history with celebrity spokespeople and internet awareness . In 2014, the ALS Ice Bucket Challenge went mega-viral online, giving the disease one of its first pushes into the global consciousness since baseball legend Lou Gehrig was diagnosed with the disease in 1939. Stephen Hawking is one of the names most associated with the degenerative illness, but he lived an incredibly rare 55 years after getting diagnosed. Eby’s goal is making sure people know what ALS actually does, and why an increase in funding and research could actually change people’s lives for the better. Because there is no one specific test for ALS — and the initial symptoms vary so wildly — much of the time where experimental treatments could be helpful is spent confirming people have ALS in the first place. These treatments can range from new medication to clinical trials aimed at ALS early symptoms. Eby doesn’t like using the word parasocial, but she does note that her content works because it makes people feel like they know her. When she posts a humorous anecdote about accidentally taking a weed gummy too soon and getting stuck in her lift chair, or a more serious update about her paralyzation progressions, she knows it gets people to stop and listen. And for her, that’s the point. “I think people could glean insights from what I’m saying. But I’m certainly not like ‘Today I’m going to preach about gratitude.’ Because I’m not feeling grateful for shit right now,” Eby says. “I would rather people see and connect with me and that way they have a dog in this fight. I want people to say, ‘Oh this girl I know has ALS,’ even though it’s through a screen. I could be your friend, your sister, your daughter. And so that way as people are tracking my progression, they’ll be pissed at ALS and the lack of [clinical] progress.” It’s been three years since Eby started posting about her diagnosis on TikTok, but the changes have happened swiftly. She is almost fully paralyzed, and calls her thumbs “the only useful things” on her body that can still do part of their original job. Most of her editing and TikTok magic happens through voice commands, and she’s able to use other devices such as laptops with eye tracking software. Her voice has gotten raspier and quieter as the months have gone on, but she hasn’t made any plans about a potential future where it goes entirely. “The fact that my breathing is decreasing at the rate that it is, it’s more likely that the breathing will be what kills me before my voice even goes all the way,” Eby says. “It’s very strange that I’m still talking. All the doctors, they’re like, ‘That’s very unique.’ Okay, thank you, exactly what a patient wants to be told.” But even while she’s joking, Eby says she’s very aware that there’s a day in the future where her TikTok followers will be given an update they don’t want to hear — that she’s gone. Eby describes days where a depression over her future takes hold in a “dark cloud.” But she says when she thinks about her TikTok, she still hasn’t figured out what the account will look like after she passes. She’s too busy having fun on it now. “People are always talking about legacy and whatever. I don’t really care,” Eby says, laughing.”  All I really care that people remember is someone like me could get this disease, and that it took me as quickly as it did. As long as when they hear the word ALs, they can picture a face, whether it’s mine or someone else’s. I can’t be embarrassed once I’m dead.”",https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-features/brooke-eby-als-activism-tiktok-death-diaries-1235443681,Entertainment,BBC,CT Jones,https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Brooke-Gehrig-Jersey-Nats-ALS-influencer.jpg?w=1600&h=900&crop=1,2025-10-09T14:32:06+00:00,805ef2870edad4dc7a2198336dfe400c8a70e3c7
19833bf44b94,Musk’s AI Is Being Used to Make Hardcore Porn: ‘Grok Is Learning Genitalia Really Fast!’,,"If Silicon Valley is a cutthroat place, the AI industry is currently its most vicious arena. Tech giants developing large language models and text-to-video generators are spending billions on data centers in order to stay one step ahead — and, they hope, to meet exploding demand from users. It seems that each company is only as successful as their last update, and tomorrow can always bring another breakthrough from a competitor, leaving them to play catch-up once again. Just over a week ago, OpenAI rolled out Sora 2, the latest iteration of its video tool, complete with a TikTok -like social app where people can share the clips they create. The release wasn’t without issues (there were notable copyright and disinformation concerns ), though for the moment, it looks as if the company has the edge in this particular race. Not to be outdone, however, Elon Musk then began plugging an update to Grok Imagine, the video feature for his company xAI ‘s chatbot. “Grok Imagine is improving super fast,” he declared in a Sunday post on X, his social media platform. One group that would agree with him is the community at Reddit ‘s r/GrokNSFWs , a forum established in August. There, users have been honing methods for getting Grok Imagine to generate explicit adult content — and the latest update has apparently supercharged their efforts. “The grok AI imagine is learning genitalia really fast!” wrote one participant, posting an AI-created clip of two naked women touching each other on a velvet-textured sheet. “Also bath robes are like the easiest way I can think of to get them nude fast,” he advised other redditors looking to fulfill sexual fantasies with Grok. “Bikinis suck because they take their time and half [the] time it doesn’t even work.” Since its inception, the content on r/GrokNSFWs has grown increasingly graphic as users learn the tricks for circumventing moderation — though at least some of them believe xAI has significantly relaxed those safeguards. “You can basically do anything at this point,” wrote a delighted member of the subreddit. “Wild they are allowing this. Enjoy!” The clip they shared showed a blonde cartoon character resembling Princess Elsa from Disney ‘s Frozen films remove a bra and begin performing oral sex on the realistic-looking penis of a male character with no face in the frame. Other videos in the post showed the same character in a variety of sexual positions. The person who generated this content said they had prompted Grok, in part, with this phrase: “Pixar animation style gorgeous super slutty and voluptuous hourglass figure woman with platinum blond braid wearing nothing fully naked relaxed on a couch in a brothel.” An impressed commenter marveled, “I still can’t believe how unhinged the last update was. Not only the nudity but the motions, boobs bounces more realistically, it’s incredible. “Only thing I’m working on now is cumshots,” they added. “Having troubles making the cum shoot from the tip, it usually just explodes from everywhere.” Other Grok content featured in recent days on r/GrokNSFWs — besides several more examples of Frozen -inspired porn — includes explicit imagery of unclothed women performing cunnilingus on each other, women sitting on dildos, women with what appears to be ejaculate on their faces, men and women having vaginal and anal sex, POV close-ups of vaginas, and nude versions of women modeled on comics characters such as Supergirl and Harley Quinn. Users have also commented that the audio elements of the current version of Grok Imagine have made for improved smut. “It is clear that they trained the AI to porn,” one person claimed . “And even the sounds, moans, I had a generation [where] the girl rode to the rhythm of the music.” Some said they had uploaded photos of real women and successfully animated them removing their shirts. “Man the halcyon days of last weekend when it was hard to get clothes off a model,” joked one redditor. The latest wave of Grok porn was evidently so extreme that on Monday, a moderator on the page had to warn members against posting bestiality content or deepfakes of actual people. The proliferation of Grok-generated adult videos is not wholly surprising. Musk has habitually amplified clips of sexualized female figures made with Grok, along with images of Ani, an anime Grok “companion” character, in skimpy underwear. Ani is programmed with a flirtatious attitude and comes with a “sexy” setting (her conversation can veer into the sexually extreme ), while Grok’s image and video generators can be set to “spicy” mode, which is what the redditors of r/GrokNSFWs use. These design choices have allowed Grok to offer far more risqué outputs than comparable AI products, and experts have warned of the potential for sexual abuse . In September, a dozen employees at xAI — which did  not immediately return a request for comment — told Business Insider that they had encountered sexually explicit Grok material and “user requests for AI-generated child sexual abuse content (CSAM).” The same month, Musk announced on X that training for Grok 5, the new iteration of the chatbot, was to begin in the coming weeks. Whether xAI has deliberately allowed Grok to cook up the sort of pornography that rival chatbots won’t remains unclear. But Musk has taken the line that such content often drives technological innovation and adoption. “I still remember 6th/7th grade debates with classmates about VHS vs Betamax!” he posted in August. “VHS won in the end, in part because they allowed spicy mode,” he explained, referring to the home video market for porn. Musk ended the post with a winking emoji. It’s one strategy, sure. The question is whether Grok can survive the AI race as little more than an NSFW alternative.",https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-features/elon-musk-grok-hardcore-porn-1235442715,Entertainment,BBC,Miles Klee,https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/elon-musk-grok-ai-gooners.jpg?w=1600&h=900&crop=1,2025-10-09T00:00:00+00:00,2781b74226e7fd5dc38e359f1a0b154f8dfdd89c
2ae35157e6de,Suspect in Palisades Fire Allegedly Used ChatGPT to Generate Images of Burning Forests and Cities,,"More than eight months after the devastating Palisades Fire in Los Angeles County was finally contained, the Department of Justice on Wednesday announced that they had made an arrest in connection with the massive January blaze, which killed 12 people and destroyed thousands of structures in coastal communities, becoming one of the most destructive wildfires in California history. Jonathan Rinderknecht, 29, was apprehended Tuesday near his residence in Melbourne, Florida, and has been federally charged with “destruction of property by means of fire,” acting U.S. Attorney Bill Essayli said at a press conference on Wednesday. This felony charge, he added, carried a mandatory minimum prison sentence of five years in federal prison but is punishable by up to 20 years in prison. Rinderknecht was expected to make his first appearance in a federal court in Orlando later that day, Essayli said. Rinderknecht has not yet entered a plea. But more curious than the allegation that a Florida man was responsible for setting a small brush fire on the other side of the country that ultimately ravaged the entire region was the “digital evidence” in the criminal affidavit that Essayli presented to the media. Investigators, he noted, allege that some months prior to the burning of the Pacific Palisades, Rinderknecht had prompted ChatGPT to generate “a dystopian painting showing, in part, a burning forest and a crowd fleeing from it.” A screen at the press conference showed several iterations on such a concept, some including buildings engulfed in flames. It’s not clear whether this is the first time a user’s ChatGPT history has been used as evidence against them in a criminal case, nor whether OpenAI , the tech company that developed it, collaborated with law enforcement in their investigation of Rinderknecht. The AI firm’s policies state that they require “a subpoena, court order, search warrant or equivalent before disclosing requested non-content user information,” and only shares content “in response to a valid warrant or equivalent.” They also provide “only the data specified in the legal process,” the policy states. Sam Altman , OpenAI’s CEO, has warned that ChatGPT offers no legal confidentiality . And the AI for Change Foundation, a nonprofit that advocates for ethical AI with enhanced safeguards, has pointed out that court precedents are evolving in this area , with judges in the U.S. and abroad ruling that AI chatbot logs are discoverable records. OpenAI did not immediately return a request for comment. Essayli said that in addition to the ChatGPT pictures, the Justice Department’s allegations against Rinderknecht are supported by evidence found on his phone, alleged false statements to authorities, as well as “his behavior during the Lachman Fire,” which he is charged with “maliciously starting” on a hilltop in the Pacific Palisades shortly after midnight on New Year’s Day. The Lachman Fire was suppressed by firefighters — according to the criminal complaint, Rinderknecht called 911 several times to report it and then returned to take video of emergency responders — but continued to smolder in underground root systems until extreme Santa Ana winds, hot and dry, caused it to surface and spread  on Jan. 7, then explode as the Palisades Fire. The same day, the Eaton Fire ignited in the San Gabriel Mountains of east L.A. County. That blaze ultimately killed 19 people. While the official statement from the U.S. Attorney’s Office on the case does not mention the ChatGPT images discovered in Rinderknecht’s record of exchanges with the chatbot, Essayli seemed to suggest that they could be used in court as proof of premeditated intent to commit arson. He declined to address the question of possible motive. Rinderknecht had been working as an Uber driver in the area shortly before the Lachman Fire ignited, with two of his passengers from late that evening telling investigators that he appeared angry and agitated during their rides. The legal matter of admitting ChatGPT evidence remains mostly uncharted. It’s likely, however, that attorneys and law enforcement will increasingly regard chatbot logs as forensically relevant to prosecutions in the same way text messages and online communications are. They can provide revealing insights into states of mind and individual preoccupations — fire, for example. One might imagine their secrets safer with an AI program than another person, but, as with all digital information, the data can always be uncovered.",https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-news/chatgpt-palisades-fire-suspect-1235443216,Entertainment,BBC,Miles Klee,https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/palisades-fire-arrest.jpg?w=1600&h=900&crop=1,2025-10-08T19:56:16+00:00,76d14edca100922f51a9dc68ced7749f12626a16
96d0d83c99c1,‘Verging on unwatchable’: Guardian writers on their most stressful movies,,"Fall The only movie I have literally had to take breaks from in order to give my sympathetic nervous system time to downshift out of flight or flight mode, Scott Mann’s 2022 psychological thriller Fall is brilliant in its simplicity. Thrill-seeking climbing influencer Hunter convinces her bestie Becky to do a little immersion therapy after her husband Dan’s sudden death during a climb leaves her fearful, depressed and suicidal. The goal: to climb a decommissioned TV transmission tower deep in the California desert that’s roughly twice the height of the Eiffel Tower. When the rickety ladder that gets them to a tiny platform at the structure’s top falls to smithereens, the women suddenly discover new meanings of SOL. The film is nothing if not an excuse to gloriously parade a series of show-stopping, sweaty-palm scenes, yet it becomes a deeply psychological, intricate twin character study as Mann gradually peels back the layers of Hunter and Becky’s up-and-down friendship, and the latter’s gradual rediscovery of her courage. With word that Fall is being made into a franchise, I am eagerly awaiting the next opportunity to send my adrenal glands into overdrive. Veronica Esposito Gaslight Only one thriller ever hit so hard that its title became a pop-psych buzzword for a form of emotional manipulation. And, with respect to your toxic ex, no one is better at gaslighting than Charles Boyer’s villainous Gregory. In Victorian-era London, Gregory moves his new wife, Paula (Ingrid Bergman), into a sprawling gilded cage of a townhouse that just so happens to be the site of her aunt’s still-unsolved murder. There, Gregory slowly and systematically attempts to convince Paula she’s insane. George Cukor’s slow burn remains maddening as ever 80 years since its release, anchored by Bergman’s steely, Oscar-winning performance: even as she unravels, she resists shrinking into fragility. I’ve never seen Gaslight in a theater and I’m not sure if I could, because my last rewatch unnerved me so much that I had to pause the film every 10 minutes to pace around my apartment. Do not watch this one without whatever vice you need to unwind nearby. A laina Demopoulos The Vanishing You can forget your Ringus, your Exorcists or your 127 Hours, the film that reduced me to a quivering wreck was The Vanishing, a (now fairly obscure) low-key Dutch thriller from 1988 whose brilliance and traumatising effect have been somewhat obscured by the fact that the same director (the late George Sluizer) was persuaded to remake it in Hollywood with a ludicrously reconfigured ending. I saw it when it came out without really knowing what to expect – this was the pre-internet era, when films tended to turn up without deluges of advance information. I won’t give away the big ending, but it is the story of a man whose girlfriend goes missing at a petrol station, and after years of looking for her, confronts a man who offers him the chance to find out what happened to her if he takes a sleeping pill. Well, when he wakes up and flicks on his cigarette lighter, I absolutely lost it, like the rest of the audience. I’m not a drinker but only a bunch of whiskeys in the cinema bar after returned me to any kind of normality. Andrew Pulver Uncut Gems I first heard of Uncut Gems , fittingly, on Twitter, that locus for terminally anxious scrollers constantly looking for their next hit of controversy. Yet even prepped with ten versions of a tweet hailing the film’s “step on your neck” achievements, I was still stunned by the vise-like grip of boiling anxiety that is the Safdie brothers’ 2019 magnum opus. In the first nine minutes and 59 seconds alone (which Netflix put on YouTube as evidence that Uncut Gems is “quite possibly the most stressful movie of all time”), Diamond District dealer Howard Ratner ( Adam Sandler ) gets a colonoscopy, places a risky bet, gets accosted by hired goons for failing to pay back a $100,000 loan, screams at his loanshark as negotiation, screams at his mistress for no reason, and pawns something from the Weeknd for $23,500. And that is the least stressful part of the movie. The rest is an unrelenting downward spiral of bad bets, Hail Marys, high-risk bullshitting and Howie being, at minimum, incredibly pushy. My cortisol levels have never been the same. Adrian Horton Full Time If the sound of a morning alarm or a closing train door reliably gives you a hit of anxiety, you may need to approach this most relatable of urban thrillers with caution. Laure Calamy is superb in Full Time , brittle and grimly aware of each looming obstacle, as Julie, a single mother battling through each day, running on fumes. Her daily schedule pivots on perfect timing – the school run, to the suburban train to her cleaning job in the city – just as her household depends on that chambermaid wage and her ex’s alimony cheques. But the threads unravel – the money is late, the childminder resigns, and a strike cancels all the trains – just when Julie has the chance of an interview for a life-changing job. French-Canadian director Eric Gravel keeps the camera lurching with Julie from crisis to crisis and manipulates a score of rushing electronic beats and antagonising ambient noise, as her taxing routine turns into a desperate, dangerous race. Pamela Hutchinson Her Smell In the first segment of Alex Ross Perry’s swirling, strange, ultimately uplifting rock-and-roll drama Her Smell , Elisabeth Moss ’s tortured frontwoman Becky Something tears around a concert venue greenroom, haranguing friends, family and collaborators in a drug-addled, mental-health-crisis frenzy. It’s utterly harrowing; Perry and Moss make us desperate for a door, a window, or some other egress through which we might escape this storm. But no such deliverance is available. We must instead sit with Becky as she hits something like rock bottom. Catharsis, even sweetness, comes later in Perry’s garrulous and lovely film. But those beginning minutes are excruciating, verging on unwatchable. What is brilliant about the film is how Perry stops just short of total alienation. And how Moss, in career-best work, allows us brief glimpses of the wounded humanity rippling underneath Becky’s horrible behavior. One hates to watch it, but Her Smell does eventually reward the viewer for their commitment to sticking it out. It is a beautiful metaphor for what it is to know and love an addict. Richard Lawson Baby Boy It doesn’t matter how many more Fast & Furious movies Tyrese Gibson stars in or R&B songs he drops on the side. For those of us who opted into seeing Baby Boy when it released in 2001 or were forced into rewatching it from the endlessly replays across cable TV through the decades, he will always be Jody, the titular man child with an exasperating lack of self-awareness. Jody professes to love his girlfriend, Yvette (Taraji P Henson), but won’t give up womanizing. He takes umbrage with his mother taking in a boyfriend (Ving Rhames) even though his 20-year-old hide has no business still living at home. He takes himself for a street thug and immediately retreats into cowardice whenever he comes up against a real alpha (Snoop Dogg’s Rodney). Believe it or not Baby Boy was actually marketed as a coming-of-age film, but Jody gets scared straight instead of learning and growing on his own. And even though director John Singleton really nailed the inviolate narcissism that is seemingly at the core of every wannabe gangster, it just makes Baby Boy all the more uncomfortable to sit with. Andrew Lawrence Clockwise Why isn’t Clockwise – Michael Frayn ’s immaculate comedy in which John Cleese’s headmaster tries to get to Norwich in time to deliver a speech – more exhausting to watch? It does, after all, tap into a remarkably universal nightmare. I think it’s because Cleese absorbs the trauma on the viewer’s behalf. Brian Stimpson came six years after Basil Fawlty and, despite superficial similarities, is a sympathetic and plausible character: a martyr attempting to muzzle his bark, a man well-intentioned beneath the ramrod moustache, the victim of more than his own belligerent efficiency. Cleese is startlingly good and subtle, too – I’m now certain Daniel Day-Lewis nicked the intonation of his milkshake speech in There Will Be Blood from Stimpson’s final meltdown. A word, too, for the fringe stresses endured by Penelope Wilton (weeping kidnapped in a car stuck in a field), and by Alison Steadman and Geoffrey Palmer, both stuck at some point wrangling three elderly women with dementia. The way Palmer’s gallant patience frays into hysteria is especially great. And for the actors playing those women: Constance Chapman, who only wants to go to the loo or the hospital, Joan Hickson, who monologues constantly about an inheritance dispute involving sherry glasses, and – most wonderful – Ann Way, entirely charming and delighted regardless of circumstance. I had forgotten the moment Steadman is speaking to an irate woman on her very suburban doorstep when Way pops up to ask: “Can we see over the house? Is it open today?” I will never forget her trilling rendition of This Is My Lovely Day over the climactic car crash. Clockwise is stress elevated to pure elegance, and a really underrated breakdown. Catherine Shoard Good Time Before going their separate ways, the Safdie brothers (Benny and Josh) made their names synonymous with panic-inducing, anxiety-attack cinema; their films hanging to characters trapped and suffocated by their own worst impulses. The high-stakes gambling thriller Uncut Gems is the sibling duo’s most entertaining – what with the flash, the comedy and the Sandler of it all. But Good Time , starring a fearless and magnificent Robert Pattinson as a conman named Connie, is the one that gets under your skin; especially since skin colour is the capital Connie preys on. He flails between robbing a bank and extorting drug dealers, all in a bid to keep his developmentally delayed brother (played by co-director Benny) out of group homes or jail. Connie has our sympathy. What makes Good Time so unbearably stressful and unsettling is how he takes advantage of that. He pleads and barters, at times politely, always with a desperation that masks his own entitlement. Connie’s unfortunate circumstances outweigh the hardships of the Black people in his orbit, who he victimizes or scapegoats, in this unnerving portrait of being down and out – and clinging to white privilege when that’s all you got. Radheyan Simonpillai Punch-Drunk Love In retrospect, Paul Thomas Anderson doesn’t really love to inflict suffering on his characters. More of his movies end on an optimistic note than not. But back in 2002, when he had far fewer movies under his belt, that didn’t seem quite so obvious – and moreover, his romantic comedy Punch-Drunk Love does such a great job simulating the feeling of a waking nightmare or rising panic attack that during my first viewing, I watched with my fists clenched and sweaty, terrified that something tragic would befall Barry Egan (Adam Sandler), the meek but occasionally rage-prone hero of the piece, or Lena Leonard (Emily Watson), his unlikely love interest. Anderson particularly uses Sandler’s capacity for violence, played off for slapstick laughs in his broad comedies, as a constant threat; you’re not really afraid he will attack Lena, but that he’ll take an intense wrong turn off of a physical or psychological cliff without the armor a normal feelgood (or self-aggrandizing) Sandler comedy provides. Despite that weird intensity, the movie is still frequently hilarious, even romantic; it’s a high-wire act all the more impressive for still working, in its way, as a rom-com. Subsequent viewings, one you know where it is going, play a little differently. But that first time back in 2002 was a different experience entirely. Sandler, of course, would go on to star in the anxiety-inducing Uncut Gems, which I would bet good money is someone else’s choice in this roundup. Who knew the Chanukah Song guy would become such an expert in this form of cinematic stress? Jesse Hassenger 4 Months, 3 Weeks and 2 Days I remember going to see Cristian Mungiu’s Palme d’Or winner 4 Months, 3 Weeks and 2 Days on a date. I was aware of its plot in the vaguest of terms but it was a choice made more as a 23-year-old trying to impress a slightly pretentious yet thoroughly handsome older academic, pretending that I had absolutely zero interest in watching Alien vs Predator: Requiem instead. Before the film had started, we were holding hands in the dark, naively unaware of what was about to unfold, and then it began, with a ticking clock and a nosebleed and we were off to the races. What I had assumed would be a considered arthouse drama slowly morphed into one of the most uncomfortably suspenseful thrillers I had ever seen, made that much harder to watch because of how awfully naturalistic it all was. A young woman, Otilia, tries to help her friend Găbița get a black-market abortion in late 80s Romania and every stage of their potentially lethal quest is a nail-biter. But while the procedure itself is obviously a nightmare to watch, it’s the scene soon after that got me. Otilia has left Găbița alone in the hotel room to let it take hold, given impossibly strict instructions by a vile and short-tempered abortionist, and must grimly endure inane dinner talk with her boyfriend’s family, her mind visibly racing toward every awful conclusion.

2b25367a7244,"‘I’m going to write about all of it’: author Chris Kraus on success, drugs and I Love Dick",,"C hris Kraus regards the late success of her first book, I Love Dick, with ambivalence. A work of autofiction, first published in 1997, it chronicles Kraus’s infatuation with a cultural theorist named Dick, a doomed, one-sided love affair that nonetheless pulls Kraus, a depressed, 39-year-old failing film-maker languishing in a sexless marriage, out of her personal and artistic rut. After a slow start, the book became a cult classic and in 2016 it was made into an Amazon Prime Video TV series , with Kraus played by Kathryn Hahn. “To me, success would have been like a long review in the New York Review of Books, not being a character on a sitcom,” Kraus says now. Her commercial success was a financial boon, of course. “But who can stand by a book they wrote 20 years ago? It was massively embarrassing to go out and support the book as if I’d written it last year.” She had, however, promised herself that if she ever achieved mainstream success she would write about it with the same candour that she brought to her struggles. “I’m going to write about all of it. Not just about youth, but about middle age,” she says. “Middle age is so much harder to write about, because youth is kind of like a trope. We’re very familiar with reading books about the aspirations or disappointed aspirations of youth, but middle age is much crazier ground. It’s not as sexy, it’s not as familiar. So, to write about middle age in the same way takes commitment.” Kraus is now 70 years old, frank and sharp and funny as ever. She’s speaking by video call from her home in Baja, Mexico, where she stays when she wants to escape LA to write. Her onscreen name, confusingly, comes up as Agatha. “Oh, that’s my dog’s name. My account goes under my dog’s email address,” she says, very matter-of-factly. Agatha is a chihuahua-terrier mix and somewhere in the background. “Why does your dog have an email address?” I ask, when no further information is forthcoming. It’s for spam. Who can stand by a book they wrote 20 years ago? It was massively embarrassing The Four Spent the Day Together, Kraus’s ninth book, is another exercise in radical disclosure, this time exploring how, as Kraus’s public profile soared in her 60s, her private life fell apart once more when her second husband relapsed into drug and alcohol addiction. She chose to write about being married to an addict because the experience is “underrepresented”, she says, perhaps because there is so much shame attached to it. “I think it’s maybe more shameful for the co-addict than it is for the addict,” she observes. But Kraus, who writes unflinchingly about shame and abjection, finds writing a way to metabolise those feelings. On the page, everything becomes “material”. “My character is just a character in the book. It’s never yourself – even if you use your own material. You’re never the same person, you’re constantly changing,” she says. Kraus prefers the term “nonfiction novels” to “autofiction” because her books are as much about other people as they are about her, and she describes her approach as “reporting on experience”. “The fabulation of an entirely invented world of a novel is completely beyond me,” she says, “but transcribing and reporting to be accurate, that’s something I can do.” She changes names and details, but “I don’t invent anything. It’s more a matter of mixing, it’s a composition.” For decades, she has kept a detailed daily diary. “Just the act of writing anchors you in time and gives a reality to things that have happened that would otherwise be completely vaporous and elusive,” she says. In her novels, Kraus uses herself as a case study, digging so deeply into her own, singular story that she uncovers truths that feel closer to universal, if not for everyone then at least for other “weird girls”. To construct them, she supplements diaries with boxes of photographs, interview recordings and – in the case of her latest book – court transcripts. The Four Spent the Day Together is split into three parts: the first describes Kraus’s upbringing in blue-collar small-town Connecticut; the second covers the slow, traumatic breakup of her second marriage; and the third describes Kraus’s journalistic investigation into a brutal murder that took place close to her former summer house in Minnesota, in a working-class community ravaged by meth. Kathryn Hahn in the TV adaptation of I Love Dick. Photograph: Everett Collection Inc/Alamy In her more recent novels, Kraus has written about herself in the third person and used pen names, so that she can treat her characters “like clowns or puppets” and maintain enough emotional distance to write about very sensitive, personal topics. In this book, Kraus is Catt Greene and the character based on her second husband, a psychologist, is named Paul Garcia. Paul says awful things to Catt, telling her that she is old and ugly and that he only married her for her money, and she lives in fear of his rage. Late at night she Googles things like “is my partner abusive?”. The reader is desperate for Catt to leave the relationship well before she does so. “I’ve talked to other friends in this situation, who’ve been partners with addicts. And it really is like a frog in boiling water. You tend to rationalise it as not really the person, it’s the addict,” she says. She tried to find a therapist, but while there are countless therapists who specialise in supporting addicts, the only one she found who helped family members lived miles away, in Santa Barbara. She used to go to Al-Anon meetings often, but she struggled with their official position that it’s possible to carve out a healthy life for yourself while living with an addict. Ultimately, she did seek a divorce. Kraus’s writing lays bare not only her private life, but that of others. The real-life Dick, identified by New York magazine as the British academic Dick Hebdige, tried to block publication of I Love Dick. How did her ex-husband respond to his unflattering portrayal? “The publisher wanted him to write an email giving his permission, and he did that happily and gladly,” she says. “The person who Paul Garcia is based on is now in a very strong and quality recovery … and we’re still very close to each other in many ways.” Is she saying they are back together again? Kraus laughs, sounding suddenly very girlish, and either embarrassed or appalled. “I mean, who knows,” she says. “If you’ve known someone for 20 years and they are part of your permanent family, those are such flexible and relative terms: together, apart,” she adds as she recovers her poise. Anyone who has gone through a year of high school is damaged for life When it came to writing about her upbringing, Kraus held back until after her parents’ death, believing they would find it too painful. “Everything about our family was based on pretence, and pretence is the opposite, of course, of writing. I didn’t want to hurt them,” she says. Her father worked in the warehouses of the Cambridge University Press but would have everyone believe he was an editor. He was “a little bit Asperger’s”, she says, spoke with a fake British accent and had a fantasy that he was the illegitimate son of a famous Park Avenue surgeon. Her mother was “the enabler of these fantasies”. Kraus was a good student, but was bullied mercilessly at school in Milford, Connecticut. By 13, she was regularly bunking off and hitchhiking to bars to drink with older guys. She might have gone completely off the rails had her parents not decided to emigrate to New Zealand in the hope their children might be happier. “They were timid people, and this was a very bold move. It was the boldest, most radical move they had made in their lives,” she says. New Zealand in 1969 felt like the end of the world, she recalls. “Magazines came by boat, and they didn’t arrive until three months after they had been published.” The fresh start helped Kraus and her younger sister, who settled easily into school in Wellington. Her New Zealand high school was “much more interesting and challenging”, she says – you actually got to read whole books. “It wasn’t perfect, but there wasn’t the level of vicious bullying and scapegoating that there was in the US.” Why was the bullying worse in America? “I mean, it’s notorious!” she says. “Anyone who has gone through a year of high school is damaged for life!” Her first husband, the cultural critic Sylvère Lotringer, would tell her he preferred working with non-Americans “because he said there was something about the American upbringing that made people so defensive and competitive and distrustful”. Kraus worked as a journalist in New Zealand before returning to the US in her early 20s, initially in the hope of becoming an actor. She met Lotringer in 1980, when he attended a performance piece she had written and performed in New York. They married in 1988. Lotringer founded the independent publishing house Semiotext(e), where Kraus remains an editor. Although it marked the beginning of the end of their marriage, Lotringer was initially supportive of Kraus’s infatuation with Dick, pleased that she had a distraction from her struggling film career, and he wrote several letters to Dick too. Semiotext(e) published I Love Dick, as well as Kraus’s later autofiction, Aliens and Anorexia (2000), Torpor (2006) and Summer of Hate (2012). Kraus is also the author of several essay collections and a biography of the novelist Kathy Acker, whom she deeply admired and who was an ex-girlfriend of Lotringer. skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Inside Saturday The only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

When, seven years later, three teenagers kidnapped another teen and shot him dead on a hiking trail near their home, Kraus drew on her journalistic background to investigate their lives. Before they killed the victim and used his meagre savings to buy junk food, the teens spent 36 hours hanging out together. What had driven them to commit such a brutal and seemingly senseless killing, she wondered? The working-class America they had grown up in – an ex-mining town torn apart by addiction, violence, family breakdown, poverty and lack of opportunity – was entirely different from the blue-collar community in which she had spent her early years, and geographically close but a world apart from Kraus’s rural bolthole. A local landlord told her that the teenagers’ thinking and worldview were “depraved” – “and I thought that was the most profound answer I got from anyone in the book, much more so than the educators, the police, the lawyers,” she says. “There’s just an inexplicable depravity at the heart of it that pretty much defines American contemporary society. It’s a nihilism and an apathy that swirls underneath everything.” Meanwhile, she watches in horror as President Donald Trump succeeds in his “flood the zone” strategy, creating endless social media diversion to distract from his power grabs and excess. She is due to travel to Mexicali, in Baja California, to visit an exhibition by a Mexican friend who, although a green card holder, no longer dares travel to the US. “Why has the resistance to Trump been so ineffective?” I ask. The Trump administration is “so well-organised now, so relentless,” she says. “They are making incursions on every single front: the gerrymandering, the culture wars, the immigration roundups. To be in a position of resistance already takes so much more. It’s so much harder to defend than attack,” she adds. “That’s compounded by the fact that there’s no political party that has any glamour or allure to lead the resistance. The Democratic party could not be lamer or less sympathetic or appealing to anyone.” One person who has the right idea is Gavin Newsom, the governor of California, she continues. “He’s obviously less than a perfect avatar of the Democratic party. He’s a billionaire, he’s an enormously privileged person like Trump, but at least he gets it. You have to play the game you’re in and the game now in American politics is just cynicism, distraction and insult.” ‘Writing anchors you in time’ … Kraus. Photograph: Maggie Shannon/The Guardian Kraus is similarly politically outspoken in The Four Spent the Day Together, and she’s likely to annoy some on the left, too. She believes that the #MeToo movement overreached, for instance. “There’s so much competition within the attention economy that people push things to their absolute limits,” she says. In 2018, she wrote a controversial blogpost defending Avital Ronell, a New York University professor who was accused of sexually harassing a male grad student. She maintains that Ronell, whom she describes in the book as a “philosopher pixie”, was “completely villainised” in the New York Times piece that broke the story. “It was so clear to me that this was the next media pivot. #MeToo was already getting a little played out and stale and for a gay man to accuse a gay woman, that gave it another month of play,” she says. (The NYU investigation had found that Ronell sexually harassed the student and suspended her for an academic year.) Around this time, she became subject to much Twitter mockery and insult for being a landlord, having for decades written and spoken openly about subsidising her artistic career by buying up and managing low-value rental properties. In her new book, she recounts since-deleted tweets by book critics calling her things like a “POS slumlord”. “I understand how people see landlordism as a kind of evil,” she says, because she recognises the frustrations of young people priced out of the property market, “but it’s a good and service like any other.” And unless you are independently wealthy, she points out, most artists need another source of income. For years, Kraus has taught graduate art students at the ArtCenter in Pasadena, and she’s acutely aware of how much harder it is becoming for underrepresented artists to break through. Arts and humanities funding and scholarships that were established in the 20th century, when the economic climate demanded a global professional class, have mostly disappeared, she says, and “techno-capitalism doesn’t need that educated class any more, so it’s all shutting down”. Would someone with her background be able to make it today? “Put it this way, my students or former students who are merely the children of lawyers or architects or college professors feel that they are underprivileged, because they won’t necessarily have access to family money beyond college,” she says. In much of her work she has tried to probe unexplored aspects of the human experience, but this kind of storytelling will become harder. “There’s nothing wrong with privileged people making art – they’re great artists,” she says, “but it’s a single channel of experience that gets represented.”",https://www.theguardian.com/books/2025/oct/11/im-going-to-write-about-all-of-it-author-chris-kraus-on-success-drugs-and-i-love-dick,Culture,BBC,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b10a2018d74efd60737556d7748e97f82d2206fc/550_1098_2759_2208/master/2759.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=aff65d77466aac24c7703398ca5b29f6",2025-10-11T08:00:18+00:00,430c56f26192197e3d63a81929d9e8137b9d18bf
6236a7d83bbb,The Freak: script of Charlie Chaplin’s unfinished final film to be published,,"He rose from the slums of Victorian London to become arguably cinema’s first great comic artist, with The Great Dictator and Limelight among his masterpieces. Now the script of Charlie Chaplin’s unfinished final film is to be published, having been pieced together from drafts, storyboards and sketches, on which he had been working before his death in 1977, at the age of 88. Titled The Freak, it is a fantasy about “a beautiful creature with wings … a bird with a human body”, as Chaplin wrote of an otherworldly female creature named Sarapha, which has the power to cure illness and bring peace to the world. The comic genius, who created the Little Tramp with his trademark bowler hat and cane, planned to appear in a cameo role as a startled drunk who watches her fly above him in the London sky over the Houses of Parliament. Chaplin in 1969. He spent time in London that year exploring ways to pull off the flying scenes. Photograph: Jane Bown The surviving working papers for The Freak are more extensive than for any of Chaplin’s other films. They reveal that he was close to shooting it. They detail everything from scene breakdowns to special effects sessions, including wings for Sarapha. There are also financial projections, minutes of technical meetings and production schedules. David Robinson, Chaplin’s official biographer who has written the book containing the material, said: “It’s a shame that it wasn’t finished because it could have been a marvellous film.” For the role of Sarapha, Chaplin had cast his then teenage daughter Victoria, who recalled: “For hours, for weeks, for months, he [Chaplin] studied the movements of birds in flight – the living mechanics of wings. He watched films where men and women soared through the sky. But the techniques back then did not satisfy him. He wanted to find his own way – crafted, personal – a way to translate the sensation of flight on to the screen. I believe he would have found it. But time clipped his wings. Charlie Chaplin never brought his vision to life.” A sketch by Gerald Larn of the winged character, described as ‘a bird with a human body’. Photograph: Unknown/The Roy Export Company Ltd. All Rights Reserved Sticking Place Books will publish The Freak: The Story of an Unfinished Film this weekend. Paul Cronin, its British publisher, said Chaplin created a heroine as timeless as the Little Tramp, an outsider: “Chaplin made that very clear in his production notes.” This is the first time the script has been published in English, in its original form. It had appeared only in Italian in 2020, in a limited run by the Cineteca di Bologna, which has catalogued the entire Chaplin Archive . Chaplin’s daughter Victoria is fitted with wings. Photograph: The Roy Export Company Ltd. All Rights Reserved Cecilia Cenciarelli of Cineteca di Bologna, who has edited the forthcoming book in a collaboration with the Chaplin family, said The Freak had been largely unknown even to Chaplin scholars: “We found ourselves handling hundreds of pages of this film we’ve never heard anything about and turned to David [Robinson’s] ‘bible’, Chaplin: His Life and Art, for clarification, only to realise that The Freak was barely mentioned.” Among the papers are casting notes marked “confidential”, listing Robert Vaughn, James Fox and Richard Chamberlain as contenders for the lead role of an English professor who befriends Sarapha after finding her on his roof, injured and unconscious. In one scene, she tells him that she hates her wings: “I don’t like mystifying and frightening people … I am afraid of everyone and everyone is afraid of me.” In another passage, Chaplin wrote that Sarapha “loved him in spite of the fact that he was without wings”. In 1969, Chaplin was in London, exploring ways to pull off the flying scenes. There were talks with companies that created flying effects for the stage as well as film special effects experts, including those at Shepperton Studios. The new book includes an interview with one of the artists, Gerald Larn, who created 150 drawings showing the wings and Victoria in flight. He said: “Charlie was very clear and detailed about what he wanted and what he expected from us … We thought it would be a difficult project, but not impossible … The good thing was that we always got feedback from Charlie.” A page of the script.

All Rights Reserved Arnold Lozano, the manager of the Chaplin estate, described the forthcoming published script as “the first comprehensive presentation of Chaplin’s last, unfinished film project”. He added: “Drawn from nearly 3,000 pages of Chaplin’s words, photographs and designs, along with his own recorded readings and piano compositions for the score, it reveals The Freak as perhaps his final bequest. Unique within his body of work yet still touched by unmistakable Chaplinesque elements, this publication offers a rare glimpse into one of the most remarkable projects of his 63-year creative life in cinema.”",https://www.theguardian.com/film/2025/oct/11/the-freak-script-charlie-chaplin-unfinished-final-film-to-be-published,Culture,BBC,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7ba0d3e9158585f9b0fda0849ec7f4f30b1fa0f4/158_0_2150_1720/master/2150.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=e9b337cbebef30d2d65b87304d6fc1a7",2025-10-11T05:00:14+00:00,04d63828a61ce4ebab1efe8161b80d9933f54649
ec7b70c7193c,Is This Thing On? review – Bradley Cooper’s comedy of comedians is a charmer,,"H ere’s a joke: a man walks into a bar and, to avoid paying a $15 cover, signs up for an open mic night. He’s in the midst of a divorce and a little high, a walking, middle-aged black rain cloud. He’s never done stand-up before. The punchline? He’s actually kinda good at it – rough around the edges, unpracticed, a little stiff but, under the glare of the spotlight, able to spin some of his pain into self-deprecating jokes and unforced laughs. It helps immensely that this man is played by Will Arnett, the gravelly voiced comedian and former BoJack Horseman who excels at masculine sad-sacks with self-flagellating charm. Like Arnett the celebrity podcast host, Arnett’s Alex is self-deprecating, subtle, effortlessly if dryly funny – in other words, easy to root for, even in the very midlife crisis pursuit of stand-up comedy. That’s good news for Bradley Cooper’s latest directorial effort, Is This Thing On?, which, despite its foregrounding of discovering stand-up, is more a subtle, self-deprecating, ultimately endearing rom-com between two people who were married for 20 years. Their split, at least, was amicable. Is This Thing On?, written by Cooper alongside Arnett and Mark Chappell, opens with Alex and Tess (an especially winsome Laura Dern) calling it quits with all the drama of brushing one’s teeth. Before they’ve even told their friends – primarily Cooper’s Arnie, a cartoonishly self-absorbed working actor, and his artist wife (Andra Day) – Alex has moved out of their suburban house and into a prototypically divorced dad apartment downtown, a gray place devoid of personality or much furniture. His still-married parents (Christine Ebersole and Ciarán Hinds) meddle but refuse to take sides. The former couple split custody of their two 10-year-old sons, played with sharp comedic timing by Blake Kane and Calvin Knegten. Marriage Story this is not. But the friendliness doesn’t make the quotidian struggles of separation any less painful. Is This Thing On? fast-tracks Tess and Alex’s confused stumbles into single life in one’s late 40s, while rewardingly slow-rolling the reasons for their split. It refreshingly devotes less focus to the much-ballyhooed experience of dating again or sleeping with someone new – though there is, of course, some of that – than the trickier, scarier work of discovering new hobbies and rediscovering oneself, of rebuilding identity and self-worth both post-split and in middle age. Tess, a former Olympic volleyball player whose lostness is buried under several layers of steely pride, experiments with coaching. Alex has comedy, which he convincingly explains to his children as the grown-up version of making up stories to get through. The film is loosely based on the life of the British comedian John Bishop, who, like Alex, accidentally stumbled into stand-up mid-divorce by putting his name down to avoid paying cover. Unlike Bishop, who performed his first set to about seven people at an entry-level pub, Alex starts at New York’s famed Comedy Cellar – certainly no amateur’s hangout, though it does effectively serve as a love letter to the city’s thriving comedy scene and the people sick enough to process life on stage in front of other people (said with love, and appreciation for no excess painful bombing scenes). Interstitials between Alex and Tess’s strained co-parenting paint a rosy picture of comedian camaraderie, as Alex goes from accidental natural and student of the craft, with new friends played by real standup regulars Jordan Jenson, Reggie Conquest and Chloe Radcliffe (and, as themselves, Sam Jay and Dave Attell); Amy Sedaris plays a supportive booker. Alex’s nascent love affair with the art of stand-up, one man’s process toward processing his raw feelings on stage, is so enjoyable that I found myself wishing to stay at the cellar longer; this community, at once caustic and supportive and all in love with the same thing, is far more convincing Tess and Alex’s mutual one, populated with the type of caricatures or exaggerated bits you might find in a standup routine (and, inexplicably, former NFL star Peyton Manning as a fellow mid-40s divorcee who looks, sounds and acts exactly like Peyton Manning). Cooper, who shares more than a passing resemblance with Arnett, is particularly distracting, if funny, as a comically over-serious creative who makes no sense with Day’s overbearing artist. But these off notes fade into the background of Alex and Tess’s evolving dynamic – sometimes barbed and sometimes witty, always charged and, in the hands of Arnett and Dern, magnetic. Is This Thing On? picks up steam as the two begin to fall in love in ways they didn’t expect – with new hobbies, with new versions of themselves – and trip over the questions and hurt they bring up. Both actors believably bear the mark of this weird, unexpected, inexplicable period of transition – Dern is positively sprightly as Tess reconnects with an older version of herself, Arnett lumbering with the pain of new revelations, both jittery on the edge of something new in what becomes an absorbing portrait of a relationship in flux. Is This Thing On? starts with a punchline – sad divorced dad stumbles into a bar as a cry for help – and smartly works backward; like a great routine, beneath the jokes lurks something tender, grounded and real.",https://www.theguardian.com/film/2025/oct/10/is-this-thing-on-review-bradley-cooper,Culture,BBC,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b6af660a10ca3f26aae9a91641607d9ea5bb513b/379_0_2500_2000/master/2500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctcmV2aWV3LTQucG5n&enable=upscale&s=991549edf7c5becf4d04a945c702c1be",2025-10-10T22:30:06+00:00,e64ec73ac62df882cb31ef4ad29761be0e5ff0df
dcc9bd803ad1,John Lodge was a pioneering force of British rock’s most underrated band,,"T he moment everything changed for John Lodge and his bandmates in the Moody Blues came one night at the Fiesta club in Stockton. Lodge and Justin Hayward were new to the band, Lodge playing bass and Hayward guitar, who had been booked into a well-paid series of cabaret shows in northern England. The Moodies were playing a revue-style show, with bits of R&B punctuated by comedy numbers, dressed in blue suits. They’d had a big hit a couple of years earlier with Go Now, but by 1966 they looked and sounded passé. After the show, Hayward told me a few years ago, a man came to the dressing room to see the band. “Normally they would say something like, ‘Oh, you’re great.’ But he said, ‘I just thought I’d tell you, you’re the worst fucking band I’ve seen in my life. You’re rubbish. And somebody’s got to tell you.’” Hayward and singer Ray Thomas were reduced to tears, and later on, as their van headed south from the venue, drummer Graeme Edge piped up from the back: “He’s right, that bloke. We’re crap.” The next day, the Moodies pledged to drop the suits, the act and the past, and reinvent themselves. In doing so they became British rock’s most underrated band: pioneers of a style, consistent platinum sellers across multiple decades in the US and Rock and Roll Hall of Fame inductees who played prestige venues on both sides of the Atlantic until their career ended in 2018 with a Vegas residency. And John Lodge, who has died aged 82, was central to that enduring success, as bassist, singer and songwriter. With Days of Future Passed in 1967, the Moody Blues didn’t so much embrace the new psychedelic fashions as assimilate them and catapult past them in one movement: a year earlier they had been a cabaret band, and now they were creating the elements that would form a new genre: prog rock. Not that the Moodies were terribly prone to 20-minute epics with multiple time signatures. They wrote what were at heart pop songs, but wrapped them in gorgeous arrangements, with lush harmonies and rich instrumentation (the defining sound in Nights in White Satin, their “legacy” song, isn’t guitar: it’s flute). They understood the capabilities of the studio in a way few of their contemporaries did. And in a band packed with capable songwriters, Lodge more than held his own. Ride My See-Saw, from 1968’s In Search of the Lost Chord, showcased Lodge’s talents: you can hear the R&B band in the rhythm section and Hayward’s choppy guitar, but the vocals are layered so deeply the song becomes almost hymnal. It’s very much of its time, but also entirely fantastic – the sound of pop evolving in the moment, in the studio. (There’s a live version from 1969’s that’s blistering: this band really could rock.) Lodge had chosen to be bassist because he loved pianists. As he told It’s Psychedelic Baby magazine in 2023: “When I was at school, there was a cafe right by my school with a Rock-Ola jukebox. Every lunchtime, I used to leave and instead of having lunch at school, I’d go to the cafe, drink a cup of coffee and put a coin in the slot and play whatever my favorite record was. I realised that what I really liked about rock’n’roll is the left hand on the piano, the driving force. I realised that the artists I was listening to were people like Fats Domino, Jerry Lee Lewis, Little Richard, and I realised the left hand side, the boogie piano, was the heart of rock’n’roll … There were no basses in Birmingham at the time. When the bass finally came to town it appeared in a music shop called Jack Woodross. Every Saturday morning, all the young musicians would go there and play their guitars and learn something new from someone else. And one day, I went there and I saw ‘Direct from the USA, Sunburst Precision Bass’ in the window. So I went home and said to my father, could you help me buy this bass? And we went back to the store, I bought it, and it’s been with me ever since.” By 1972, the Moodies were genuinely huge, and encouraged by their propensity for vague but faintly profound-sounding lyrics, fans took to thinking they possessed rather more wisdom than they actually did, a situation that provoked what became Lodge’s defining song for the Moodies, I’m Just a Singer (In a Rock and Roll Band). The track, which reached No 12 in the US as a single, saw Lodge disavowing any kind of knowledge: “And if you want the wind of change / To blow about you / And you’re the only other person to know, don’t tell me / I’m just a singer in a rock and roll band.” The 1973 tour to support Seventh Sojourn saw the Moody Blues living a lifestyle more commonly associated with Led Zeppelin. As Lodge recalled in the liner notes for a reissue of the album: “We had our own Boeing 707 aircraft which was decked out with a sitting room and a fireplace. There were two bedrooms, some 20 individual TVs, soundsystems everywhere and we had our own butler and our name written on the outside of the plane. I had a very empty feeling knowing that things had got this excessive.” The following year, the band went on hiatus for four years. It was probably a good job, because as Andy Childs wrote in ZigZag in January 1976, just as punk was stirring, “They make records which sell to middle-class trendy young couples living in the stockbroker belt who know and care as much as about rock music as Batman.” When they returned in 1978, with the Octave album, it wasn’t exactly as the Clash, but the album’s opener, Lodge’s Steppin’ in a Slide Zone, showed that the Moody Blues could adapt to changing time without losing their essential Moodiness – the layered vocals and unusual arrangements were still in place, but Steppin’ in a Slide Zone had an aridity that still sounds very 1978, clean and taut and tense. Just in case anyone was scared off, Lodge’s Survival from that same album had orchestras to go with the synths, and the gentleness that was one of the group’s great qualities. Yet although they were the great survivors and great successes of psychedelia’s golden age – arguably only Paul McCartney had more success for longer – the Moody Blues never occupied a central cultural space. But they did occupy their own space, and that was more than enough for the vast numbers of people who never stopped loving them. And Lodge never took music lightly. He always saw in it the potential for something more than entertainment. In that 2023 interview, he was asked what “psychedelic” meant to him, and answered perfectly: “I hope your mind will explore the music and take you wherever the music takes you. It’s not a case of just singing along, it’s listening. It can be one note and that transports you somewhere. And I think if you can conjure up experiences and stories in your mind where the music takes you, to me that’s psychedelic. You have to listen to things, not just hear them.”",https://www.theguardian.com/music/2025/oct/10/john-lodge-moody-blues-pioneering-force-british-rock,Culture,BBC,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cc533c7543e586584b296a41f79e261584d12921/433_0_4331_3465/master/4331.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=a42afa261c9a6817b45d88b5bc8e30a3",2025-10-10T16:43:35+00:00,f3f9dc4b03814285bd480a593dd70f0fe7433960
851c78d10779,"Seth Meyers on Trump: ‘deeply unhinged, detached from reality’",,"Late-night hosts have questioned Donald Trump’s cognitive abilities as he makes further blunders during his second term. Seth Meyers On Late Night, Seth Meyers replayed clips of various rightwingers talking about Joe Biden’s cognitive decline when he was president and then told viewers that the same people should be more aware of Trump having similar issues. Recently, he repeated the debunked claim that he predicted Osama bin Laden would engage in mass terrorist activity one year before 9/11. Meyers played footage of him slurring a catalogue of errors to a crowd. “Finding the dementia in that clip is like finding Waldo in a book called Oops! All Waldos,” he said. Meyers said “the president’s brain is mush” before playing footage of him not knowing what habeas corpus is. ‘The president should probably know what it is,” he said. Trump appeared to think it was a person and when he asked who that was, Meyers joked: “Look at the panic in his eyes.” He asked for help from Kristi Noem, yet the head of homeland security has also previously struggled to define what it is, with Meyers showing footage of her being schooled by a senator. Meyers said that Republicans had become “so uninformed they’re turning senators into the principal from Billy Madison”. Trump has also been “threatening to jail elected officials who get in his way” with a bizarre Truth Social post where he claimed he would lock up the mayor of Chicago for not assisting Ice agents being sent to the city. Meyers said Trump is “deeply unhinged, detached from reality” and probably has dementia. Jimmy Kimmel On Jimmy Kimmel Live! the host said we were living in “a golden age of awful”. This week sees Trump heading for his annual medical checkup which Kimmel said he wants to ace so he can take part in the “annual tradition of eating all of Eric’s trick or treat candy”. He also told anyone who thinks their job is bad to spare a thought for the person who “has to give Donald Trump a prostate exam”. Trump has also been heavily campaigning for the Nobel peace prize, something Kimmel ridiculed. “I’ve seen a lot of Oscar and Emmy campaigns but no one has vied for an award more rigorously,” he said. Kimmel said that “no one has suffered more unfairness” than Trump. In a social media post, the White House even sent out an image calling him “the peace president”. Kimmel joked that this man of peace is “sending a platoon to invade a yoga studio in Portland right now”. Meanwhile, Noem is threatening to “lock up American protesters for life” after claiming to have captured founding members of Antifa, an “entirely imaginary organisation”. Trump’s wild claims about Portland has Kimmel thinking he is getting his intelligence briefings from “reruns of The Walking Dead”. All of this is just an “attempt to distract us from the Epstein files he doesn’t want us to see”. This also explains the government shutdown to avoid a potentially risky vote that could expose Trump. “It’s so brazen,” Kimmel said. He then played footage of a surprisingly reasonable Marjorie Taylor Greene who pointed this out in a TV interview. “I don’t know if she had a near-death experience or maybe a medicine ball fell of a shelf at the gym and hit her on the head,” he said. She also spoke about Trump’s inability to help Americans lower prices and raise wages. “Keep that up you’ll be dancing with Bad Bunny at the half-time show,” Kimmel said.",https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2025/oct/10/seth-meyers-trump-unhinged,Culture,BBC,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/95c9e090c40328cb8aefa4a1f37360063af67cd2/320_0_1137_910/master/1137.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=3dda36f0c3511025be4c0d534450b596",2025-10-10T14:24:35+00:00,d71fd1e5268e5ccda4c12101d243bbaad792b3b0
8494b1b66004,Is being a Guardian reporter as exciting as the movies make out?,,"I n The Woman in Cabin 10, Netflix’s new potboiler, Keira Knightley plays a fearless justice warrior, a lone voice of dogged truth in a maelstrom of corruption, and this is not her first foray into such terrain: six years ago she played the whistleblower Katharine Gun in Official Secrets , the 2019 film about some pretty dicey US and UK behaviour before the Iraq war. This time round she’s a journalist , though – and not just any old hack, a Guardian journalist. Exhausted and possibly traumatised by a crusading investigation she has just finished about some bad people doing bad things, she accepts a trip on a billionaire’s yacht for a breather, only to discover that billionaires are also bad . You cannot call that a spoiler, even though it technically is one. You’re reading the Guardian, for Pete’s sake. Close in mannerism … Toby Jones as former Guardian editor Alan Rusbridger in The Hack. Photograph: Shutterstock Journalists on screen are always idealised, whatever paper they’re from – film amps up the tenacity, intelligence, commitment and, often, cardiovascular fitness of hacks, which is fair enough: that’s its business, to filter out frailty. The only rose-tint that bugs me with print journalism, and this has been bugging me since Almost Famous came out a quarter of a century ago, is that all the drama happens in a situation where interesting things are going down and the key players actively want to include a journalist. It just isn’t true to life. Any time a billionaire, or a rock quartet, or some generals, or a prime minister, actively want to talk to you, it’s to tell you something boring, to keep you busy. But this is a pet peeve; back to Knightley, on her yacht, being told real things, when a murder happens. Box sets and films dealing specifically with the Guardian – Snowden , about the CIA whistleblower and the paper; The Hack , about Nick Davies’s hacking investigation; its role in The Bourne Ultimatum – idealise in bespoke ways. They always make the office look incredibly lively, people constantly leaping up and pointing at each other in a universally understood semaphore of hard news, whereas in real life people are disappointingly quiet and sedentary, often, en masse, remaining so still that the movement-triggered lights go off. Knightley in this film is exquisitely tailored. The stories always get into print incredibly fast, with nobody ever saying: “We won’t be able to say this until it’s been proven in a court of law, which will take roughly 18 months.” Why they used the Guardian in The Hack and Snowden is self-evident, it’s because those things happened here; in The Hack, the performances are so close in mannerism and bearing that you just have to hand it to them, they obviously were trying to work with what they had. David Tennant is spookily like Nick Davies , Toby Jones doesn’t physically resemble former editor Alan Rusbridger but almost shapeshifts. All other considerations (please stop saying “redacted”, it’s very distancing; is it too much to ask that the bad guys go down for something?) melt away. In Snowden, I was constantly distracted by the glamour of people being journalists, yet also being in the US, or Hong Kong or Russia. There was no gloss, here! Janine Gibson (now at the Financial Times, played with a Her-Own Girl Friday briskness and vim by Joely Richardson) genuinely was in New York at the time, this shouldn’t push at the boundaries of disbelief-suspension, and yet it does. Briskness and vim … Joely Richardson as Guardian journalist Janine Gibson and Nicholas Rowe as the paper’s assistant editor, in Snowden When it’s an entirely fictional character, set in this newspaper that really exists, you have to wonder what the film is trying to say with that. Paddy Considine admitted straight to our faces that he’d had to “to wimp down a little bit ” to play Simon Ross, security correspondent, and this is a) because he’s in this with Matt Damon, so has to be his opposite (a wimp); b) because he’s gonna die in a minute, so you mustn’t fall in love with him; and c) because he’s meant to embody the noblest search, for truth without ego. A mixed bag, then, for the newspaper as trope; very moral, not very sexy. There are some neat observational lines that approximate the trade pretty well – when Bourne is on his phone, directing him through Waterloo concourse, telling him to go “east”, he surmises correctly that he won’t know which way that is, adding “your left”. But then there are other lines like, “This isn’t some story in a newspaper, this is real. Do you understand me?”, to which Ross replies, “Yes” – whereas in real life, he would say, “Actually, all the stories in our newspaper are also real,” and then maybe Bourne would reply, “What about that time you told everyone to vote Lib Dem”, in the middle of which the CIA would shoot Ross in the head. Search for truth … Paddy Considine, right, with Colin Stinton in The Bourne Ultimatum. Photograph: Universal/Sportsphoto/Allstar Why Knightley has to work here, for The Woman in Cabin 10 , could be to convey in shorthand her sense of civic duty, or it could be to give her a dusting of wholemeal flour (oh, there’s that pill of a woman again, who could be drinking champagne but instead is going on about the dead body she just saw), or it could be to give the whole thing a Gaslight -y frisson, she’s a journalist that a bad guy could plausibly persuade everyone was totally insane. Sometimes the paper pops up on its own as just a thing people are reading – in Wallace and Gromit, in Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince – and I want to say it’s there to signify: “This is the baseline reading matter of the everyman.” Maybe in Wallace and Gromit it is, but I think in fact it’s a global-audience thing, they can’t use the Times because an American audience will go: “The New York is missing and the font is wrong.” In Killing Me Softly (2002) the Guardian is everywhere; its journalist interviewing one of the other characters, another character masquerading as a hack, all of them constantly reading it. It’s widely thought of as the worst film of all time . It’s just a coincidence; no actual Guardian journalists were harmed in the making of that film.",https://www.theguardian.com/film/2025/oct/10/keira-knightley-netflix-woman-in-cabin-10-guardian-in-the-movies,Culture,BBC,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/97737e81d239018d9b37cacd83329794562c7894/686_0_4167_3333/master/4167.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=00ad644ab5a8378928eda9ca93cbf450",2025-10-10T13:21:05+00:00,0a6ebf5026853190d6dfa42cb2509b5c1c969804
0da3f3a58303,‘Visual medicine’: Jamel Shabazz’s evocative photos of Brooklyn’s Prospect Park,,"T here is, allegedly, a commonly held belief among landscape architects familiar with New York City: for Calvert Vaux and Frederick Law Olmsted, the designers of both Central Park and Prospect Park, the former was merely practice for the latter. Located in Brooklyn , Prospect Park, 300 acres smaller than the Manhattan landmark, has a specifically insular quality. A surrounding urban horizon is obscured from view by old-growth forest and 175 species of trees; the park is beholden to its own rhythms, with waterfalls, grand lawns stretched across the borough’s glacial rock formations, and fewer adjacent towering buildings. Visiting feels like a quiet reprieve. For the Brooklyn-born photographer Jamel Shabazz, Prospect Park has long been, as he writes in his newly released book, Prospect Park: Photographs of a Brooklyn Oasis, 1980 to 2025, “one of my best teachers … a giver of life”. Shabazz has lovingly documented his city since 1980 (or earlier, if you count an adolescent stint with his mother’s Kodak Instamatic), photographing Black and brown New Yorkers of all ages with tender reverence: on the train, at the boardwalk, impeccably dressed, always camera-ready; Shabazz ensures his subjects are collaborative participants in the image-making. He has chronicled his work across several chapters – New York’s Pride parade, its emerging hip-hop scene, young romance – and into, by his count, 12 books, including A Time Before Crack, The Last Sunday in June and Back in the Days. At his home in Long Island during the Covid-19 lockdown – a curse of mass death, Shabazz says, that forced him to slow down – he examined his archives “and structured my work into themes, a gift and lesson I learned from my father, a professional photographer. It was an opportunity to look at my creative process, frame by frame.” Prospect Park, 1988. Photograph: Jamel Shabazz Prospect Park continually reappeared, as backdrop and muse. He compiled the park negatives and in 2021, they were presented publicly at an exhibition organized by Photoville and the Prospect Park Alliance, which prompted the attention of Prestel Publishing. The previously exhibited works are featured in the book amid a much larger selection; in one of Prospect Park’s five texts (including two by Shabazz himself), the New Yorker photo editor, Noelle Flores Théard, writes: “His photographic process in the park was more organic than his purpose-minded portraits on the street.” The Prospect Park portraits contain Shabazz’s signature throughline of care alongside a palpable ease bestowed by the titular oasis, a feeling the photographer remembers affecting him early and instantly. Shabazz was seven, maybe eight, when he visited the park for the first time. School was closing for the season, and the sun was shining. “It was a beautiful summer day,” he says. “The air smelled fresh. We had pizza and took the bus to the park, and I’ll never forget the exhilarated feeling of being free in this new space.” An avid reader with unfettered access to his parents’ vast library of books and magazines, he pored over articles about animals in Life and National Geographic, learning, he explains, to empathize equally with humans and non-humans. (He recalls an early affinity for the work of Jane Goodall.) Prospect Park enabled him to see wildlife up-close, an experience that “transformed” him. Shabazz and his cousins loved to chase butterflies; they’d bring mayonnaise jars from their homes in Red Hook “and have competitions: who can catch the best butterfly or bee? It was a joy to step into a place surrounded by this serenity, this atmosphere of natural beauty.” Prospect Park, 1995. Photograph: Jamel Shabazz The natural beauty abounds in Prospect Park: in one image, a girl blows a dandelion, a blur of whirled petals at her side. In another, a father sits in a tree and reads a book aloud to his son, who watches from below. “When I saw that, it blew me away,” Shabazz shares. “There’s something artistic about the beauty of the tree, too. It’s an ideal backdrop.” In 1977, still in his youth, Shabazz enlisted in the military and was stationed in Germany’s Black Forest, where the petrichor and greenery made him nostalgic for home. “It reminded me of Prospect Park: being in the field, in the woods, the smell,” he says. When he returned to the city in 1980, “I came home to war. A lot of young men were at odds with each other, and lives were being taken.” He began making portraits with his Canon AE-1, partly inspired by the creativity of his parents. “My father put me on assignment,” he says. “He directed me to look deeper.” Prospect Park, for Shabazz, was no longer simply thrilling but hallowed. In between spontaneous shoots, he’d walk to Lookout Point, nearly 180ft above sea level, and write. “That was my sacred spot,” he says. “When you’ve been in the military, it takes a while to reacquaint yourself with civilian life. The park served as a transitional space to separate myself from the noise, to be alone.” Shabazz had also joined the New York corrections department, with which he’d spend the next 20 years. Six of those were at Rikers Island, where the conditions were disheartening and the circumstances surrounding the inmates’ detention troubling. “After what I experienced and saw at work, the park was therapeutic.” His co-workers from the academy were among the first people with whom he shared his growing portfolio; eventually, he began mentoring the inmate population. “The photographs started conversations about life, about atonement. If someone came upon a photograph of Prospect Park, it might take them back to a point in their lives when they’d gone there as a child.” Prospect Park, 1982. Photograph: Jamel Shabazz Parkgoers, he realized, had a shared objective: seeking comfort. It was easier to approach his subjects there, to ask for permission. “It’s a slower pace. The heart rate goes down. My style was brick walls and gates, but in the park, I had sunrises and sunsets.” The photographs’ light often reveals the season: the red, stained-glass sun of fall; the dappling of glowing gold, marking the dawn of summer. A couple in twin cerulean coats embrace on a snow-dotted bridge. In the spring, another couple do the same, on a tree stump carved with a face (Shabazz has a knack for finding his oeuvre’s parallels; mirror-images poses, snapped decades apart, appear throughout). A man paints an autumnal soccer game en plein air . A woman and two girls feed a paddling of ducks. At Drummer’s Grove, a gathering place where Shabazz met the Vietnam veteran and activist Richard E Green – who contributed an essay to the book’s pages – revelers encircle each other, dancing, wailing on trumpets. If the book has a theme beyond the setting, it is time. In the park, Shabazz had more of it to share. In return, everyone pictured granted him theirs. Prospect Park, 1982. Photograph: Jamel Shabazz Shabazz has spoken of spotting his subjects’ beauty, how compelled he feels to hold it up to the light and create what he calls “visual medicine”. He wants to capture love, he says; in doing so, he hopes to give it back. One black-and-white photograph, made in 1982 and featured in a two-page spread in Prospect Park, depicts four smiling women on a bench. When Shabazz posted it on his Instagram, where much of his archive is showcased, a young man contacted him to thank him and share that those were his sisters, three of whom had since passed away. The connections he made back then, even briefly, keep resonating. Today, he visits Prospect Park infrequently, finding new sacred quiet at Jones Beach, his “second home,” in the fall and winter. When he does return, it’s a reunion. “I go to Drummer’s Grove, because a lot of the people I photographed back in the days are still there. I bring my portfolios and we reconnect.” He describes his camera as a compass, he continues, that “leads me to the people who I need to meet. My objective is to make sure that the history is preserved, to secure my legacy and, importantly, that of all the people who’ve stepped in front of my lens.”",https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2025/oct/10/jamel-shabazz-prospect-park-brooklyn-photography,Culture,BBC,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b18a3b4aeb66bebbffc175ef8982f36de9fa4ec3/321_0_3274_2620/master/3274.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=51033c6486b8a6cb1db3afe8e128a58f",2025-10-10T09:02:49+00:00,1bb6afc7211da4f5c0ff84b79849c886c63421e5
e4ca5e6362fb,"Bath mats, candles and underpants: would Basquiat have loved or hated all the merch?",,"I t seems like a new Jean-Michel Basquiat fashion collaboration drops online most weeks, from a £20 Uniqlo crew neck T-shirt to a kimono or a sports bra. But more than 35 years since his death in 1988, would the New York artist have been flattered or horrified by the mass marketing of his art? Basquiat’s premature death at 27 means that questions will remain as to whether he would have signed off on things like bathmats on Redbubble or Ligne Bath’s Trumpet candle . How would he, for example, have felt about a Basquiat collaboration with MeUndies underpants – with the tagline: “Jean-Michel Basquiat … taught us all to look inward and find our authentic self. MeUndies always strives for authenticity.” A new book, Jean-Michel Basquiat: The Making of an Icon , by Doug Woodham, the former president of Christie’s auction house in the US, hopes to answer this question and unpack the neo-expressionist’s journey to becoming one of the most famous artists in the world . “I think comparing [him] to Keith Haring is a good way to try and understand it,” he said. Haring was a contemporary and friend of Basquiat’s and, according to Woodham, “was the first contemporary artist to realise he could put his motifs on a keychain and sell it at pop-up shops, knowing that it wouldn’t hurt his market value”. While Woodham believes Basquiat would be “excited and happy” about how the estate has marketed his artworks, he is unsure the artist would like all the merchandise upon which his work appears. Friend and artistic collaborator Al Diaz, who co-created Basquiat’s Samo graffiti tag, is more definitive. He believes the merch dilutes the meaning and message of the art in the process. “It’s abusive at this point. It’s demeaning to the artist, offensive and disrespectful,” he says over the phone from New York. Was there anything Basquiat would have categorically hated, I ask? “There was that Barbie doll they did and a door mat. It seems so over the top and thoughtless,” he says. “It’s like, ‘OK, let’s print this on everything and anything’.” Keith Haring and Jean-Michel Basquiat in December 1987. Photograph: Irving Zucker And yet the spectre in the popular consciousness of Basquiat as the starving junkie punk artist is complicated by Woodham’s portrayal in The Making of an Icon. Once the artist started making money, he is characterised as “loving cash”, his ambition leading him to make a beeline to a friendship with Andy Warhol and even self-branding in a costume of designer suits flecked with paint. He had seen his fellow artist Julian Schnabel garnering attention for showing up to parties wearing pyjamas. “He chased fame very strategically and deliberately,” says Diaz. “He was very, very clever and had a special charm.” The book posits that three key traumas shaped the artist: a near-fatal car crash during childhood; the sometimes violent breakdown of his parents’ marriage, which led to his mother, Matilda, having a nervous breakdown; and finally his mother’s wish for his father, Gerard, to raise him and his two sisters alone. Gerard Basquiat was born in Haiti, but fled the country because of civil unrest, first going to Miami before ending up alone in New York. The artist’s father only spoke French, but after learning English, he became an accountant. “He’s really impressive,” says Woodham, “he’s also very domineering”. Gerard Basquiat often butted heads with his son. “Everybody wants to be recognised and supported by their parents,” says Diaz. “He had a lot of anger and disdain and disappointment because he never received that from his dad … having a bisexual, art-orientated son was not in [his father’s] playbook.” After Basquiat’s death, his estate was taken over by his father, and their layered relationship bled into our modern understanding of the artist. In The Making of an Icon, Gerard is portrayed as savvy – he partnered with Keith Haring’s legal team who taught him about licensing – but also, understandably, controlling of his son’s narrative. Woodham spoke off the record to gallery curators who said that Gerard Basquiat would lean on them to omit certain parts of the biography (his mother’s role in his life, the effects of his childhood trauma and the depths of his drug habit and bisexuality), so a more “heteronormative” narrative would be promoted. A narrative, one would assume, that would make him more palatable to both the elite art market and the wider public.

Photograph: Dinanda Nooney, courtesy of the Photography Collection, the Miriam And Ira D. Wallach Division of Art, Prints and Photographs, the New York Public Library There was a uniformity to how all the museum and gallery catalogues were written, says Woodham. And yet, he says: “I think all these strands add a richness to the guy’s character. I think it makes him more compelling and interesting.” The reach of Basquiat’s art is undeniable. And for a younger generation, many of whom only know him through this merch, it simply doesn’t matter that his art is omnipresent. “It’s fascinating to talk to 30-something collectors,” says Woodham. “For them, Basquiat has always been in the pantheon. And the first time they ever heard of him was from a Uniqlo T-shirt.”",https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2025/oct/10/basquiat-book-the-making-of-an-icon-artist,Culture,BBC,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cf2b010e1badc9cef38e11bec637a30c6ee839a2/74_62_2799_2239/master/2799.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=7be48f9be8358da99f9b2243240b9d18",2025-10-10T12:43:09+00:00,16d750c501ee92e372f87a899c814426be79b386

According to the logline, the series, based on a series of novellas by the Game of Thrones author George RR Martin , will follow “two unlikely heroes” who wandered Westeros: a “young, naive but courageous knight” named Ser Duncan “Dunk” the Tall, played by Peter Claffey, and his “diminutive squire” Egg, played by Dexter Sol Ansell. The events – seemingly a lot of knight training, jousting and at least one battle – take place during “an age when the Targaryen line still holds the Iron Throne and the memory of the last dragon has not yet passed from living memory, great destinies, powerful foes, and dangerous exploits all await these improbable and incomparable friends”. In classic Thrones fashion, the trailer presents a medieval world of knights, kings, squires, peasants, dragons and, if Egg is to be believed, at least one magical comet. The series also stars Finn Bennett as Prince Aerion Targaryen, Bertie Carvel as Prince Baelor Targaryen, Sam Spruell as Prince Maekar Targaryen, Daniel Ings as Ser Lyonel Baratheon and Tanzyn Crawford as Tanselle, a Dornish puppeteer. It takes place 100 years before the events of Game of Thrones, which wrapped after seven seasons in 2019, and 72 years after the events of House of the Dragon, HBO’s first prequel series that premiered in 2022. The third and penultimate season of House of the Dragon, which has drawn mixed reviews from audiences, is scheduled for release in 2026. Martin, an executive producer and writer on A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms, wrote on his blog that the new series will be “much shorter” than Game of Thrones or House of the Dragon, “with a much different tone”. (To wit, unlike House of the Dragon, the new trailer features a couple of jokes.) He added that in terms of world-building and surprises, “it’s still Westeros, so no one is truly safe.” At New York Comic Con, showrunner Ira Parker told fans that “our guiding light on this show was to follow Dunk in terms of tone and point of view and the mud and the dirt. We wanted the audience to feel what he feels. We want to be with him as closely as possible. “It’s not big, sprawling Game of Thrones that we’ve come to know and love; it’s close and it’s hard,” he added, according to Deadline . “We kept flooding this field with mud and dirt and shit … the pain, the agony, the irritation, the closeness; as soon as you put on a mask, it changes the way you breathe. We’ re going to feel every grit of that.” Parker has also assured that this series will be less focused on fantastical elements than prior shows. “Nobody’s thinking about magic,” he told Entertainment Weekly. “This could basically be 14th-century Britain. This is hard-nose, grind it out, gritty, medieval knights, cold with a really light, hopeful touch. “It’s a wonderful place to be,” he added. “We are ground up in this series, we are starting right at the bottom. We’re not with the lords and ladies, the kings and queens.” A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms will premiere in January on HBO and HBO Max.",https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2025/oct/09/knight-seven-kingdoms-first-trailer-game-of-thrones,Culture,BBC,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/18204ad9037bf9de6dfeb438ad952331a316bbba/141_0_1600_1280/master/1600.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=4b60def6d3b68bf3d30b9c2486a53782",2025-10-09T17:22:19+00:00,944525d3ae4a71a7f60e63e947a3b5be87e2e87d
9ad6d9aa161e,Amazon’s $40m Melania Trump doc set for January release with ‘exclusive footage’ of ‘critical meetings’,,"Amazon is set to release its Melania Trump documentary in cinemas in January 2026. The film follows the first lady in the 20 days before the 2025 inauguration and comes from director Brett Ratner. It marks the film-maker’s first feature since he was accused of sexual misconduct by a number of women in 2017. He had denied the claims. The official description states that Melania will show us the world through her eyes as “she orchestrates inauguration plans, navigates the complexities of the White House transition, and re-enters public life with her family”. The documentary will also include “exclusive footage capturing critical meetings, private conversations, and never-before-seen environments”. She also acts as a producer on the project. “We started the production in November, and we are shooting right now, so it’s a day-to-day life, what I’m doing, what kind of responsibilities I have,” Melania said in an interview on Fox & Friends in January . “It’s day-to-day, from transition team to moving to the White House, packing, establishing my team, the first lady office, moving into the White House, what it takes to make the residence your home, to hire the people that you need.” She added that the film was partly a result of the success of her memoir. The Guardian’s Lloyd Green called that “a 180-page exercise in buck-passing and blame-dodging”. Amazon reportedly spent $40m for the rights to the documentary. The company’s founder and executive chairman, Jeff Bezos, attended Donald Trump’s inauguration earlier this year. Bezos had previously been under fire for allegedly barring the Washington Post for endorsing Trump’s rival Kamala Harris in the election. He later defended the decision as a way to avoid media bias. Alongside the documentary, Amazon will also release a three-part docuseries on Melania showing her life travelling between New York, Washington DC and Palm Beach. Ratner’s credits include the Rush Hour franchise and Red Dragon. After multiple women, including the actors Natasha Henstridge and Olivia Munn, accused him of sexual misconduct, his deal with Warner Bros was ended. In 2023, he moved to Israel and called himself a “proud Zionist” on Instagram. Ratner is also rumoured to be working on a documentary about the Abraham Accords and is known to be friendly with Benjamin Netanyahu, sharing pictures of them together on his social media.

a35e498f392b,Vegas vignettes and killer karaoke staples: Katy Perry’s greatest songs – ranked!,,"20. I Kissed a Girl (2008) There’s no getting around the fact that Katy Perry’s breakthrough single has not aged well in some ways – the lyrics are like a lads’ mag reader’s idea of female bi-curiosity – but musically it’s an impressively fizzy retooling of the early-70s low glam sound, with crunchy guitars and glitterbeat drums. 19. 365 (2019) German EDM producer Zedd is not renowned for the subtlety of his musical approach, which makes his Perry collab a pleasant surprise: low on big drops and the kind of synth riffs that get the Las Vegas bros waving their hands in the air, it’s got a sweet melody. 18. Harleys in Hawaii (2019) A Charlie Puth co-write that apparently documents a holiday Perry spent with her then beau Orlando Bloom. The lyrics are pretty frightful – it rhymes “hula-hula” with “take me to the jeweller” – but no matter: driven by acoustic guitar, the music is intriguingly misty and understated – and oddly charming. 17. ET (ft Kanye West) (2011) Originally written by Perry with the intention of giving it to horrorcore rap pioneers Three 6 Mafia – truly, the mind boggles. In the end, she kept the rock/hip-hop hybrid for herself. The remix, with a star turn by 808s and Heartbreak-era Kanye , is the version to hear. 16. Swish Swish (ft Nicki Minaj) (2017) Taylor Swift’s Bad Blood was supposedly a jab at Perry, and this is supposedly a jab back. The exact subject of Swish Swish is less important than its appealingly sparse 90s house-influenced sound, the Roland Clark-by-way-of-Fatboy Slim sample and Nicki Minaj’s splendid this-is-how-to-throw-shade guest verse. 15. Thinking of You (2008) A burst of surprisingly angsty, distinctly Alanis Morissette-like soft-rock power balladry (“He kissed my lips, I tasted your mouth … I was disgusted with myself”) that unexpectedly cropped up on breakthrough album One of the Boys. It’s not a style that Perry has really pursued since, which is a shame. 14. Unconditionally (2013) Perry trailed Prism, the album she made after her divorce from Russell Brand, as “shoegazing”, which it definitely wasn’t, although you could maybe hear the faintest glimmer of it in Unconditionally’s echoing guitars. Its real thrust, however, is its big old Max Martin-assisted chorus, custom-made to get arena crowds’ phone lights on and fists in the air. Unashamedly pop … at the Brit awards, 2014. Photograph: Karwai Tang/WireImage 13. Never Really Over (2019) So similar to Dagny’s 2017 track Love You Like That that the song’s authors got co-writing credits, Never Really Over is nevertheless a precision-tooled pop earworm. Its despair at a relationship that won’t lie down and die is undercut by the faint sense the protagonist is secretly rather enjoying herself. 12. Waking Up in Vegas (2008) Perry’s early appeal in a nutshell. Waking Up in Vegas’s depiction of a hungover couple attempting to piece together the previous night’s events in Sin City is preposterous, funny (“Did we get hitched last night?” it ponders, adding a panicked “Don’t call your mother!”) and packs a nailed-on chorus. 11. Last Friday Night (TGIF) (2010) Inspired by Black Eyed Peas’ I Gotta Feeling, the new wave-infused Last Friday Night offered a more realistic and relatable party anthem. Drunken misbehaviour and a maxed-out credit card get them kicked out of the bar, the police may or may not have been called and, uh-oh, the photos “ended up online – I’m screwed”. 10. Birthday (2013) Birthday marries the kind of melody Mariah Carey might have sung early in her career to Daft Punk-inspired disco-house – although it’s unlikely the Parisian duo would have countenanced something so unashamedly pop, or indeed so laden with Carry On-esque double entendres: “It’s time to bring out the big balloons”. 9. The One That Got Away (2010) The One That Got Away was the only one of six singles from Teenage Dream not to make No 1 in the US, but that’s no reflection on its quality. The jackhammer beat makes it dancefloor-friendly, but the song spikes the singer’s frothy image with a hefty dose of wistfulness and melancholy. 8. Firework (2010) For a few years after its release, Firework was wearyingly ubiquitous: no TV talent show was complete without it blaring out when a contestant passed their audition. The passing of time has made it easier to appreciate as a perfectly turned piece of anthemic pop songcraft. Allegedly inspired by – would you believe – Jack Kerouac’s On the Road. 7. Dark Horse (ft Juicy J) (2013) Prism was the sound of Perry picking sorrowfully through the wreckage of her marriage to Brand. The subject matter didn’t dent her pop smarts, but it may well have influenced the music’s hue: the trap-influenced Dark Horse had a noticeably different tone to her previous hits. 6. Roar (2013) The fifth biggest-selling single in the world in 2013, shifting 9.9m units, Roar offers an immense singalong chorus and the kind of post-heartbreak self-empowerment sentiments destined to be belted out at karaoke nights by the recently divorced for the rest of time. 5. Chained to the Rhythm (2017) A flip into singing about serious issues was always going to be fraught for a pop star as wilfully cartoonish as Perry, and so it proved on her fifth album, Witness. That said, her first attempt, aided by Martin, is pretty great – not so much for its critique of late-stage capitalism as for its monster chorus. Monster chorus … Glastonbury, 2017. Photograph: Ian Gavan/Getty Images 4. California Gurls (ft Snoop Dogg) (2010) Influenced by the Beach Boys and, more unexpectedly, Big Star – the spelling was changed to match their September Gurls after frontman Alex Chilton’s death – this song was intended as a west coast answer to Jay-Z’s Empire State of Mind. Snoop Dogg turns up in fine laconic style; every melody is a hook. 3. Hot N Cold (2008) The ghost of late-80s pop hovered appealingly over Hot N Cold, particularly in its more guitar-heavy Rock Mix. You could imagine Tiffany or Debbie Gibson performing it, although they were unlikely to sing “you PMS like a bitch, and I would know”. Whichever version you pick, it’s a killer pop song. 2. Wide Awake (2012) Written for the documentary Katy Perry: Part of Me and subsequently added to Teenage Dream, Wide Awake is the best of Perry’s teary post-divorce tracks. It’s anthemic but sparse and thoughtful, noticeably less straightforwardly eager to please than Roar and more emotionally impactful for it. She later sang it dressed as a ballot paper at an Obama rally. 1. Teenage Dream (2010) In 2014, composer and arranger Owen Pallett offered a detailed musical theorist’s examination of why Teenage Dream was so popular. It is apparently all to do with syncopation in the vocal line and a lack of I chords, the latter a trick also used in Fleetwood Mac’s Dreams (Lorde even went so far as to describe the song as “holy”). But whatever the technical breakdown, there’s no doubt Teenage Dream works. Its lovestruck optimism is shot through with nostalgia, and its euphoric chorus is supremely contagious, meaning it stood out even among the plethora of hits spawned by its parent album.

38b8f1fd2c2d,"‘Amoral, evil’: vitriolic backlash builds against comics who played Riyadh festival",,"T o paraphrase TS Eliot : and was it worth it after all? A question to ponder for those who have taken the coin of a government once described unequivocally as “the worst of the worst” by one human rights advocacy organisation. The past decade has seen Saudi Arabia invest in everything from football to opera to video games – all part of the regime’s efforts to diversify its oil-dependent economy and its execution-heavy reputation. Mohammed bin Salman’s (MBS) latest interest? Comedy. The Riyadh comedy festival , which ends today, has attracted a number of big hitters. Among them: Pete Davidson, Louis CK, Dave Chappelle, Kevin Hart, Aziz Ansari, Whitney Cummings and Jessica Kirson. While most of the performers are US based, Jimmy Carr, Jack Whitehall and Omid Djalili also appeared as headliners. Organised by Saudi Arabia’s General Entertainment Authority (GEA), the festival was intended to “amplify Riyadh’s status as a leading destination for major cultural and artistic events”. Or, as Visit Saudi didn’t put it: come for the weather and the entertainment! Stay because you’ve been arrested! Are you not entertained? GEA chairman Turki Al-Sheikh and José Mourinho at a boxing match in Riyadh. Photograph: Richard Pelham/Getty Images The organiser of the festival and chair of the GEA, Turki Al-Sheikh, is a big fan of culture. Indeed, he reposted a song on X that celebrated the lead suspect in Jamal Khashoggi’s murder. It’s interesting that MBS has discovered a sense of humour, though, as the crown prince wasn’t laughing when Masameer County , a South Park meets Family Guy-style satire, was picked up by Netflix and became one of the most popular shows in the region. Instead, its creator, Abdulaziz Almuzaini, was sentenced to a 13-year jail term and a 30-year travel ban for “terrorism and promoting homosexuality”. Others who have left MBS stony-faced? Fahad Albutairi , known as “Saudi Arabia’s Jerry Seinfeld”, who was allegedly handcuffed, blindfolded and put on a plane to Saudi Arabia when performing in Jordan in 2018. (He was also reported to have been forced to divorce his wife, a women’s rights activist.) Abdulrahman al-Sadhan was jailed for 20 years for running a parody Twitter account. Tala Safwan, an Egyptian TikTok influencer and prankster was arrested for a joke with “lesbian subtext”. And in 2018 a specific law was introduced to punish, with jail sentences and fines, anybody who produced satire online deemed to be “mocking public order”. No laughing matter … Masameer County producer Abdulaziz Almuzaini was sentenced to 13 years in jail. Illustration: Netflix You might think, then, that comedians most vehement in their protestations against cancel culture – Chappelle, Ansari, CK, in particular – would balk at performing in a country whose predilection for silencing extends to (alleged) murder by bone-saw. Pete Davidson has said that there were no restrictions on the material he could perform, a dubious claim given that Atsuko Okatsuka leaked a prospective contract she was sent. The “content restrictions” section detailed anything that “may be considered to degrade, defame, or bring into public disrepute, contempt, scandal, embarrassment, or ridicule … the Kingdom of Saudi, the Saudi royal family, its legal system … religion”. (Okatsuka declined the offer.) Another reason: Tim Dillon had his invite rescinded after making a quip about slavery in the kingdom, as did Jim Jefferies after he said : “One reporter was killed by the government … unfortunate, but not a fucking hill that I’m gonna die on.” Outing himself as an absolutely awful person and then not even getting the cash? Unfortunate . Oh, and then there’s the fact that Bill Burr, who did perform, confirmed there was censorship. But “ the royals loved the show ”, he said – so that’s nice. Perhaps the likes of Chappelle, Ansari and CK felt there was less at stake because, by their own estimation, they have already suffered cancellation. Except that their exile from public life appears to include fresh Netflix specials and Grammy awards . Louis CK should count himself lucky; if he’d been caught with his dick in his hand in Najd, rather than Colorado , he may well have retained neither of those appendages (punitive limb amputation is an actual thing ). CK’s stance on murderous dictatorships seems to have changed since this full-throated criticism of Libya’s Muammar Gaddafi . But fair play to him in one sense for getting out of his comfort zone – he has a whole bit about giving up weed and yet here he is visiting a place where getting stoned is common. CK has defended himself thus: “I struggled about going once I heard what everybody was saying.” Truly, a man of integrity. Riyadh comedy festival. Photograph: Fayez Nureldine/AFP/Getty Images Another performer who has seemingly discovered their conscience after the fact is Jessica Kirson, a lesbian Jewish comic. Kirson has tied herself in knots worthy of a grovelling balloon-dog since. In a statement post-performance, Kirson asserted her “deep regret”, saying that she was “surprised” to be asked. Disingenuous to the extreme, given the fact she openly solicited an invitation on a podcast months ago. Then there’s Hannibal Buress, widely praised for his significant role in taking down Bill Cosby ; Buress is now taking money from a government that sentenced a 19-year-old victim of gang-rape to 200 lashes and six months in prison. Meanwhile, I remember Jack Whitehall doing a skit about “grown adults getting wound up about cartoons”. Presumably he doesn’t mind the grown adults who got so wound up by cartoons that they sentenced satirist Al Hazzaa to 23 years ’ jail time for lighthearted illustrations about fasting. Of course, the primary – and here consider primary as a euphemism for only – reason for entertainers becoming sharply severed from their morals is the riyals. On the state’s Soundstorm festival bill for this December, for instance: Post Malone, Halsey and Tyla. Actors who have taken million-dollar paychecks to attend the Red Sea film festival include Will Smith and Johnny Depp. Paid in full … Jimmy Carr performed at Riyadh comedy festival. Photograph: Murdo Macleod/The Guardian At least some comedians were honest about the money grab, rather than Kirson, who called the festival “a gay-affirming event”, a stretch when its sponsors have beheaded people for same-sex activity. Davidson was more straightforward : “I see the number and go: ‘I’ll go’”. (The SNL alumnus has come in for particular criticism given that his firefighter father died during 9/11). Chris Distefano said that he didn’t want to do it, but that his fiancee had instructed him to “take that fucking money”. A more nuanced take came from Nimesh Patel, who initially said yes before backing out. “They offered a lot of money. I’m not in a position to say no to life-changing money. But it wasn’t life-changing.” Which, given the people involved, and as David Cross said in a fiery rebuke, will be true of all of them. The actor called out peers he admired who “would condone this totalitarian fiefdom for … what, a fourth house? A boat? More sneakers?” I suppose Davidson is on record as loving sneakers . Declined … Atsuko Okatsuka leaked her prospective contract. Photograph: Murdo MacLeod/The Guardian Of course, some will argue that performing in authoritarian or oppressive countries is a means of reaching the masses; opening up art to those underserved. And while that may be true on occasion, it is a different thing entirely from being sponsored by the state itself to launder its sovereignty. As Vinny Thomas sarcastically put it: “Sometimes to fight the power you have to be paid by the power.” Others argue that cultural boycotts and campaigns make little difference, even when South Africa , BDS , and more recently, Nan Goldin’s dismantling of the Sackler family’s art patronage have proven otherwise. Plenty of comedians joined Cross in condemnation, including Nish Kumar , Marc Maron and Zach Woods . In typically forthright style, Stewart Lee described participants as “evil, amoral, grifting bastards”. And Shane Gillis, Leslie Liao, Stavros Halkias and Mike Birbiglia turned down offers alongside Okatsuka. The stain on the reputations of the comedians who stood up for Saudi’s project whitewash?

bb7444ec5e75,Drake’s defamation lawsuit against Universal Music Group dismissed,,"A federal judge has thrown out Drake’s defamation lawsuit against Universal Music Group (UMG), ruling that the company cannot be held responsible for promoting Kendrick Lamar’s hit diss track Not Like Us. US district judge Jeannette Vargas decided Thursday that the song’s lyrics express “non-actionable opinion” and therefore cannot be considered defamatory. “The issue in this case is whether Not Like Us can reasonably be understood to convey as a factual matter that Drake is a pedophile or that he has engaged in sexual relations with minors,” the judgment states. “In light of the overall context in which the statements in the recording were made, the court holds that it cannot.” In a statement provided to Variety , a UMG spokesperson said: “From the outset, this suit was an affront to all artists and their creative expression and never should have seen the light of day. We’re pleased with the court’s dismissal and look forward to continuing our work successfully promoting Drake’s music and investing in his career.” A spokesperson for Drake said in a statement: “We intend to appeal today’s ruling, and we look forward to the court of appeals reviewing it.” Drake, who is signed to Republic Records, and Lamar, signed to Interscope Records, both operate under the Universal Music Group umbrella but through separate labels. The legal fight began earlier this year when Drake accused UMG of damaging his reputation by distributing and promoting Not Like Us. He claimed the company made secret payments and offered discounted licensing deals to boost the song’s reach, allegedly to harm his brand and reduce his leverage in ongoing contract talks. In March, UMG filed to have the motion dismissed. The label claimed that Drake “lost a rap battle that he provoked and in which he willingly participated”. “Instead of accepting the loss like the unbothered rap artist he often claims to be, he has sued his own record label in a misguided attempt to salve his wounds,” UMG said in its statement. “Plaintiff’s complaint is utterly without merit and should be dismissed with prejudice.” Kendrick Lamar is widely acknowledged to have won last year’s culture-consuming rap beef with Drake, with Not Like Us going on to win five Grammy awards, including record of the year and song of the year.",https://www.theguardian.com/music/2025/oct/09/drakes-defamation-lawsuit-dismissed,Culture,BBC,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ac4d1b693893f2e854e7d32ec6d1d11a713a0c59/72_59_1631_1306/master/1631.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=812093d862e76b9c2d1ced582d232104",2025-10-09T21:35:04+00:00,8d1abd48f2e26e95146171b674d159599e0b83ea

It was an influence on my life, as was Blazing Saddles. We’re big fans of Mel Brooks. The Zucker brothers are legends – they were pioneers in the parody game. I was definitely influenced by Airplane! but I think our humour was different. We didn’t change the wheel, but we put a rim on the tyre.

There’s a difference in how we present the jokes and what the jokes are about. What scares you? TurangaLeela2 Death. I like life. Have you ever seen somebody in a coffin?

We’d shoot Above the Rim 12 hours a day, then he’d go home and work all night, then the next day he’d come to set and play us five songs. We were like: “When did you do that?” He said: “Last night.” When he passed, those songs came out, like Out on Bail and Thug 4 Life, Runnin’ from tha Police … I got a preview of those songs, back in the 90s. ‘Tupac was a very hard worker’ … from left, Denise Warner, Marlon Wayans, Sherwin David “Wood” Harris, and Tupac Shakur in Above the Rim.

What are your memories? Absohudson I remember walking into the set after Ellen Burstyn and the set felt hot, like somebody had just destroyed it. Darren [Aronofsky, director] was like: “Burstyn was a force of nature. You kids got work to do.” I was like: “OK, let’s lock in.” It’s hard for Hollywood to put its finger on me. They go: “Who is he? This guy does everything.” I want to be believable to the audience in comedy, drama, slapstick, parody. I think dramatic actors can be just as funny as comedy actors, but I don’t know if they can do an hour and a half of standup. That’s the part that’s frightening. A movie’s easy. It’s just acting. ‘Sometimes, I go on stage and I don’t wanna be funny. I just wanna tell the truth’ … Marlon Wayans.

I had a slight fender bender. It happens. Especially to those of us were [sic] horrible drivers. And that’s me. All is well.” Los Angeles county sheriff deputies responded to a call about a black Lincoln Navigator striking a parked vehicle on the Pacific Coast Highway, the sheriff’s department said. The driver, who was not named, “might have suffered a medical emergency before the crash”, the department added, saying the adult male was taken to a local hospital for treatment. Simmons’s wife Shannon Tweed told NBC4 Los Angeles that the 76-year-old rocker, who is known as The Demon, was recovering at home. Tweed told the station that her husband’s vehicle had crossed several lanes of traffic in the accident. She said doctors had changed his medications recently and told him he needed to drink more water. The band sold millions of records in 1970s, putting on sell-out pyrotechnic stadium shows. “They wanted to dress like comic-book superheroes and write football-terrace anthems like Slade. Out of such dumb genius, vast fortunes are made,” noted Tim Clifford in a review of Simmons’s autobiography Kiss and Make-up.

6ef12e1747ce,László Krasznahorkai wins the Nobel prize in literature 2025,,"The Nobel prize in literature for 2025 has been awarded to the Hungarian author László Krasznahorkai, the Swedish Academy has announced. The academy cited the 71-year-old’s “compelling and visionary oeuvre that, in the midst of apocalyptic terror, reaffirms the power of art”. Krasznahorkai is known for his dystopian, melancholic novels, which have won numerous prizes, including the 2019 National Book award for translated literature and the 2015 International Booker prize. Several of his works, including his novels Satantango and The Melancholy of Resistance, have been adapted into feature films. “I am deeply glad that I have received the Nobel prize – above all because this award proves that literature exists in itself, beyond various non-literary expectations, and that it is still being read,” said Krasznahorkai. “And for those who read it, it offers a certain hope that beauty, nobility, and the sublime still exist for their own sake. It may offer hope even to those in whom life itself only barely flickers.” The novelist Colm Tóibín described Krasznahorkai as “a unique literary visionary who has opened up a huge amount of rich space in the contemporary novel showing what can be done”. “Krasznahorkai richly deserves the prize,” said the novelist Hari Kunzru. “He has a reputation as an austere figure of European high culture, and indeed some of his work is uncompromisingly bleak and difficult, but he’s also a curious, playful and very funny writer. When I read him, I feel fortified, both as a human being and as someone who’s trying to make art. He shows me what’s possible.” Born in Gyula, Hungary, in 1954, Krasznahorkai first made his mark with his 1985 debut novel Satantango , a mesmerising portrayal of a collapsing rural community. The novel would go on to win the Man Booker International prize in English three decades later, in 2015. It was also famously adapted into a seven-hour film by director Béla Tarr , with whom Krasznahorkai has had a long creative partnership. Often described as postmodern, Krasznahorkai is known for his long, winding sentences (the 12 chapters of Satantango each consist of a single paragraph) and the kind of relentless intensity that has led critics to compare him to Gogol, Melville and Kafka. “Krasznahorkai is a great epic writer in the central European tradition that extends through Kafka to Thomas Bernhard, and is characterised by absurdism and grotesque excess,” said Anders Olsson, chair of the Nobel committee. He described Krasznahorkai’s prose as having “developed towards … flowing syntax with long, winding sentences devoid of full stops that has become his signature.” Susan Sontag has described the author as “the contemporary Hungarian master of apocalypse”, while WG Sebald praised the universality of his vision. The literary critic James Wood once wrote that his books “get passed around like rare currency”. Krasznahorkai’s career has been shaped by travel as much as by language. He first left communist Hungary in 1987, spending a year in West Berlin for a fellowship, and later drew inspiration from east Asia – particularly Mongolia and China – for works such as The Prisoner of Urga, and Destruction and Sorrow Beneath the Heavens. While working on War and War, he travelled widely across Europe and lived for a time in Allen Ginsberg’s New York apartment, describing the legendary Beat poet’s support as crucial to completing the novel. Asked how he would describe his work in an interview with the Guardian in 2015, Krasznahorkai said: “Letters; then from letters, words; then from these words, some short sentences; then more sentences that are longer, and in the main very long sentences, for the duration of 35 years. Beauty in language. Fun in hell.” On people discovering his work for the first time, he added: “If there are readers who haven’t read my books, I couldn’t recommend anything to read to them; instead, I’d advise them to go out, sit down somewhere, perhaps by the side of a brook, with nothing to do, nothing to think about, just remaining in silence like stones. They will eventually meet someone who has already read my books.” Before the announcement, Ladbrokes had listed Can Xue, the avant garde Chinese writer, and Krasznahorkai as joint favourites for this year’s prize . The Nobel prize in literature has been awarded on 117 previous occasions since 1901. Recent laureates include Annie Ernaux, Bob Dylan, Abdulrazak Gurnah, Louise Glück, Peter Handke and Olga Tokarczuk. Last year’s recipient was Han Kang, the South Korean author best known for The Vegetarian. Krasznahorkai will formally receive the medal and diploma in a ceremony in Stockholm in December. “Krasznahorkai reminds us life is difficult, agency almost always out of reach, and the colours of many times and places sombre,” said the poet and writer Fiona Sampson in response to his win. His work, she says, is “an essential read for these times, not least in a Europe once again feeling the squeeze between Russia and the US”.",https://www.theguardian.com/books/2025/oct/09/laszlo-krasznahorkai-wins-the-nobel-prize-in-literature-2025,Culture,BBC,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/762f8d44ba4ab23dbd001d05d68f1d717f4ca87f/583_0_2917_2333/master/2917.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=730ee89a55b0e25bdd224323ffcc4371",2025-10-09T15:54:15+00:00,e264af45deef986984991f7005dd3919be12509d
6f1f85058976,The Woman in Cabin 10 review – silliness of Keira Knightley megayacht thriller tips it overboard,,"A s it happens, ITV drama The Hack isn’t the only dramatisation of the Guardian’s investigatory journalism right now. There is also this … erm … entirely bizarre mystery thriller from Netflix, adapted from a novel by Ruth Ware, about an intrepid Guardian reporter called Laura Blacklock, played by Keira Knightley. Fresh off a lid-lifting scoop about Kurdish children, she is invited aboard a colossal private yacht with a party of notables and celebrities, as the guest of sinister plutocrat Richard Bullmer, played by Guy Pearce; he wishes to transport them all to a gala dinner in the Norwegian fjords for an announcement about the charitable foundation endowed by his wife Anne (Lisa Loven Kongsli). Once aboard and out on the open seas, Laura witnesses something deeply strange regarding the woman in cabin 10 – the cabin next to hers – but can’t get any of the guests or crew to believe her. Did she imagine it? Is the strain of her award-winning investigatory journalism causing her to have a breakdown? Among the hilariously Agatha-Christie-ish lineup on the passenger manifest is Laura’s ex-boyfriend Ben (David Ajala), Mr Bullmer’s personal physician Dr Mehta (Art Malik), bullish businessman Thomas Heatherley (David Morrissey) and his boozy wife Heidi (Hannah Waddingham), Instagram star Grace (Kaya Scodelario), smug socialite Adam (Daniel Ings) and druggie pop star Danny (Paul Kaye). It sounds fun on the face of it, and the sheer silliness of the situation almost keeps it afloat, but the cardboard quality of the drama gets soggy. Knightley repeatedly finds herself in a situation where she falls from a great height into water; it happens twice and each time she shows her remarkable resourcefulness and an ability to hold her breath.

203d056375f0,John Candy: I Like Me review – starry but treacly tribute to comedy legend,,"H ere is a film containing some heartfelt but often quite treacly and solemn obsequies to the late John Candy, almost as if he died a few days ago, with stirring, sad music running almost all the way through. There’s an amazing lineup of collaborators and stars, and it’s good to see Candy’s uniquely likable and buoyant screen personality, but the tone borders on the stultifyingly reverential. Candy was the much loved Canadian actor and comic who was a star graduate of Toronto’s Second City comedy troupe and its small screen offshoot SCTV; he was a contemporary of Dan Aykroyd, Catherine O’Hara and Bill Murray , and went on to star in movies such as Stripes, Uncle Buck and Planes, Trains and Automobiles. His death in 1994 at 43 was due to a heart attack caused by his weight issues, and drinking and smoking (though the movie rather prissily overlooks his cocaine use). The film’s sub-title is taken from the wounded, dignified speech from Candy’s maladroit character in Planes, Trains and Automobiles after he has just been cruelly insulted by Steve Martin: “I like me, my wife likes me, my customers like me, ’cause I’m the real article.” The documentary as a whole is perhaps a little too ready to conflate that sweet character with Candy himself, who was a little more complex, more pessimistic and fatalistic after the traumatising death of his father from a heart attack at the age of 35 (when Candy himself was just five), and knowing that his successful career in comedy movies depended on being big. Candy got his break when he was cast by Steven Spielberg in 1941, and maybe he could have been a Spielbergian figure in cinema; instead, the director that took him up was John Hughes, who cast him in Planes, Trains and Automobiles, Uncle Buck and many more films. But it was Ron Howard who tapped further his sunny good nature by casting him opposite Tom Hanks in Splash, and there was some very interesting bromance chemistry between them. Candy had a natural face for the movies – open, ingenuous, boyish and trusting – although I left this documentary suspecting that nothing he did for the big screen was as funny as the appalling character he did on SCTV: Yellowbelly, the cowardly cowboy who actually shoots a small child in the back.",https://www.theguardian.com/film/2025/oct/10/john-candy-i-like-me-review-starry-but-treacly-tribute-to-comedy-legend,Culture,BBC,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/979f845350f1eff889cd8693853ace2748821f7b/445_0_2109_1688/master/2109.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctcmV2aWV3LTMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=008f1f1220f9c530bbd0431f4251c4bf",2025-10-10T06:00:46+00:00,a8a7e851d0ce58e8486fc09f65c2465b1448a932
c473b358f2c0,Vicious review – Dakota Fanning’s evil box horror is an open-and-shut dud,,"E very now and then, Hollywood comes across a hit that can’t be neatly replicated, a one-off success story that should be praised, noted and left well alone. The Strangers wasn’t supposed to do all that much back in 2008, released almost two years after it was made on the cheap, pushed around the schedule like it was toxic waste. But it was a surprise summer sleeper, making almost 10 times its budget and quickly entering the horror iconography hall of fame, with its nightmarishly mismatched masked villains and the chillingly hollow “because you were home” non-explanation. A tortured decade of stop-start attempts to make a follow-up finally resulted in 2018’s underwhelming remix The Strangers: Prey at Night , a sequel entirely devoid of the clammy tension that made the original so unbearably effective. That really should have been the last hurrah but, inevitably it was not, a three-part reboot kicking off last year with The Strangers: Chapter 1 , a rubbishy Slovakia-filmed do-over only outdone for head-smashing pointlessness by its sequel, which flopped in and out of cinemas last month (I would expect the third to go straight to streaming). All of this started with writer-director Bryan Bertino, whose post-Strangers career has been similarly awkward, with projects scrapped (including a Sam Raimi-produced horror called The Man) and non-entities like Mockingbird and The Monster failing to register with even the most devoted of horror fans. He had a little bit more luck with 2020’s grim rural horror The Dark and the Wicked but it hasn’t been the ascent of a bold new voice in the genre that many had expected, and his latest is a disappointing reminder of exactly what’s been lost since 2008. Vicious was supposed to be something of a comeback, a major studio horror with a wide summer release and a concept that should easily make it franchise-ready. But after its August date was quietly cancelled, the film is now tumbling on to Paramount+ instead, likely to be lost in the Halloween streaming glut. Like The Strangers, in another attempt to recapture a shred of that film’s success, it’s about an unwanted visitor and a late-night bang on the door. This time on the receiving end is Polly (Dakota Fanning), a woman trying to get her life together a little later than those around her, living alone in a family-owned home beyond her means, struggling to mature into her 30s. On the other side is a mysterious older woman (Kathryn Hunter) who lies her way inside before presenting Polly with a box, something you really don’t want to be presented with in a horror film. She explains that in order to survive the night, she has to give it something she loves, something she hates and something she needs. It’s a set-up that raises a box-load of questions yet Bertino isn’t able to elegantly answer them, leaving us unmoored as the chaos begins. By the time the box opens, we’re also a little bored, a slow build that’s a little too slow, limply introducing Fanning’s stock fuck-up character, complete with tattooed arms, bottle of wine and ice-cream straight from the tub (never a good sign!). Bertino is a skilled conjurer of atmosphere and he makes the most of the darkness surrounding her (a suburban street over more remote isolation also makes for a refreshing change) but the gimmick at the centre of Vicious just isn’t sticky or scary enough to rival other, more proficient, adjacent horrors like Drag Me to Hell or The Ring or Smile or some of the better Saw movies. It’s so loosely constructed – the threat is coming from where, the penalty for failure is what, the powers of the box go how far – that it’s hard to know what’s happening and why we should care. In place of suspense or dread, Bertino gives us gore, the only real element connecting the title to the film, and it’s certainly nasty enough to provoke a reaction, at least in the moment. But there’s only so much cutting and hacking and stabbing that can distract from unsure writing that isn’t taking us anywhere or really pushing us into pondering the uneasy moral questions at its centre. Even at 98 minutes, the film feels bloated, a last act of teasing, anticlimactic non-endings proving tiresome and ultimately incoherent, as if Bertino was doing panicked rewrites while he shoots (it’s very, very clear why this one was denied a theatrical release). Fanning is a more committed, if still not entirely convincing, final girl than she was in last summer’s silly fairy horror The Watchers but the novelty of watching Hunter do her all-in over-the-top genre bit has truly worn off, fatigue setting in halfway through last year’s genuinely atrocious bodily fluid-driven flop The Front Room . There’s a similarly exhausting excess to her performance here. Bertino doesn’t need to give us another Strangers, and we certainly do not need anything else in that particular universe, but he needs to give us something more striking, and certainly stranger, than Vicious.",https://www.theguardian.com/film/2025/oct/09/vicious-movie-review-dakota-fanning,Culture,BBC,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/98e160d15a82a8d835c42004b08449cec06acac3/325_0_3250_2600/master/3250.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctcmV2aWV3LTIucG5n&enable=upscale&s=46f7bcb7cf1ad24c5ffa4373ad20ab84",2025-10-09T18:32:58+00:00,480faaeb348cbb86b1356d4f4cc30d53477d7ee8
5e76363d388a,The Perfect Neighbor review – a notorious shooting through the eye of a Florida cop’s body-cam,,"T he true crime genre has a new medium, or maybe even a whole new language and grammar: police body cam footage. Faces of victims, witnesses and possible perpetrators loom up to the cameras, sometimes in the harsh glare of headlights or flashlights as the officers approach, their faces and voices eloquent of wariness or panic or indignation or suspiciously contrived innocence. And we often incidentally glimpse the faces of the officers themselves, one standing by blankly while the other asks the questions with what sometimes seems like extraordinary diffidence – though perhaps this is because they know they are being recorded. We have already had the Netflix true-crime documentary American Murder: Gabby Petito, about the slaying of an Instagram influencer by her boyfriend , whose main point of interest was body cam footage and in which, as in this film, the police seemed extraordinarily lax with the perpetrator. There is also Bill Morrison’s Oscar-nominated short Incident , composed entirely of body cam film. Now comes Geeta Gandbhir’s documentary about the grim case of Ajike Owens in Ocala, Florida , a woman of colour whose four young kids allegedly harassed and tormented her white neighbour, Susan Lorincz. In 2023, after an escalating series of neighbour-dispute incidents in which the police were repeatedly called, Lorincz shot Owens dead through her closed front door, when Owens went to Lorincz’s house to confront her about throwing objects at her children. The arresting officers found evidence that Lorincz had done online research into Florida’s “stand your ground” laws, which allow householders and others to shoot if there is a significant presumption of danger. The movie builds its story with the body cam footage generated during the repeated police visits to the scene before the killing, and then at the horrific and chaotic crime scene itself – prefaced by 911 audio material of Lorincz calling the police in a melodramatically shaky voice. There is also police cell footage of Lorincz which has a chilly, queasy fascination. The film does not really suggest anything too complicated about Lorincz, or any extenuating circumstance. She is clearly unstable, although the children are heard calling her “the Karen”, an ugly jibe. The film is presented as an example of how “stand your ground” laws generate senseless and tragic bloodshed. But the fact of gun ownership and the second amendment (that historic American constitutional privilege that the late Charlie Kirk notoriously said made gun deaths a price worth paying ) is not much highlighted. It is possible to watch the police interrogation scenes here and feel astonished at how little interest the officers took in this point. When did she buy her gun? Where (if anywhere) did she train in its use? Had she ever had occasion to fire it before? Where did she store it in the house? Was it just on the couch, loaded and ready? The police aren’t shown asking any of these surely relevant questions (though they may have done in footage that didn’t make the edit). Or is gun ownership so normal it would be like asking about microwaves or toasters? For what seemed to her neighbours a very long time, Lorincz was not even arrested and charged, only detained and even offered a hotel stay away from home for the night (another point of comparison, incidentally, with the Gabby Petito case). And when she was finally formally arrested in the holding cell, there is an extraordinary sequence in which Lorincz simply refuses to stand, refuses to put her wrists out for the cuffs, not aggressively, but with the politely self-pitying air of someone whose mental health means that she just can’t do it. Had the kid-gloves treatment up until that point encouraged her to think that this might actually work? It didn’t; and the jury’s verdict is saved for the closing credits.

Then she brought the baby to the boat and I got to photograph their first few days together. That was really special.” Mirza, an artist and writer, is speaking via Zoom, sitting outside on a bench on a sunny autumn day talking me through some of the photographs in their new exhibition and smiling. WWWADING, is a five-year culmination of photography and oral history collected along the canals of London with a focus on boaters of colour. Inspired by the idea of what they call “a marginalised people choosing a marginalised way of life”, the photographs are an ode to a community of queer or disabled boaters in their natural habitat, who don’t often have a lens on their existence. A tender moment of communion … a boater doing someone’s hair. Photograph: Aisha Mirza Mirza is half Pakistani and Egyptian (and a boater) and talks about how water is a part of their present and ancestral history. “One of the things that unites a lot of black and brown people is that we have movement in our lineages. Whether that’s violent displacement, migration, economic movement, we’ve all sailed on seas to get here and end up on this strange land. So it felt obvious that communities of colour occupying these spaces would be explored.” Mirza started asking boaters unusual questions. How has water shown up in the history of your family? How do boats inform how you live now? “One person I was interviewing was like: ‘Well, the British build canals. That’s what they do.’” The idea of colonial capitalism carved into the earth via watery networks gives the work a critical edge. “It’s considered an incredible feat of engineering despite facilitating colonialism and control through commerce and capitalism. Large areas of marshland were destroyed to build these and land never recovers.” The name WWWADING elicits ideas of watery struggle and the web, which puts us in a modern world, despite our desire to escape it at times. Mirza describes wanting to be as close to off-grid living as you can in a city. “When I first moved on to a boat, I was saying I was off grid as a joke until I realised that people living on boats in London are for the most part not tapped into any of the main grid systems. For constant cruisers, like me, who move my boat every two weeks, we’re managing our own water, we’re creating our own electricity, using solar power and gas from bottles. It’s quite hardcore.” The pictures speak to how people are using home-making as an act of resistance against the high costs of London living. From the inclusion of mobility scooters on boats to signs declaring “THE TRUTH IS IN THE SOIL” (“I heard there’s one that says Compost The Rich, but I couldn’t find it”) or display pieces of Indian and Pakistani flags kissing. One photograph captures a boater on a towpath doing someone’s hair in a tender show of communion; another is of a boater, Esme, eating a Pot Noodle. “She makes ceramics using clay foraged from the towpath,” says Mirza. “She has this tiny boat and she has an enormous dog on it. It’s as big as her.” There’s humour in the shots too. “There’s two swans who’ve swum up to my front door – and you can see an Amazon box.” ‘Her dog is as big as she is’ … Esme and her four-legged friend. Photograph: Aisha Mirza One photograph captures a person in a “Boaters Fightback” T-shirt, referencing a growing movement to resist the government’s support of privatisation of land around the waterways. “The canals used to be a place of working-class labour, but now they’re a place of waterfront views and million-pound flats,” sighs Mirza. “Residents overlooking the beautiful waterways of London don’t necessarily want to see poor people living in boats.” skip past newsletter promotion Your weekly art world round-up, sketching out all the biggest stories, scandals and exhibitions Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

b054bfd83b62,"Two years after school phone bans were implemented in Australia, what has changed?",,"W hen Australian Christian College, a high school in the Melbourne outer suburb of Casey, implemented a phone ban on its campus, there were multiple reasons for the crackdown. Peer conflicts between students were escalating online, students were struggling to focus and teachers observed “notification-driven code-switching” in their students. “When a phone is within reach, a student’s mind is only ever half in the room,” the school’s principal, Caleb Peterson, says. “We wanted their whole attention back.” School mobile phones bans typically mandate that mobile devices are kept in bags or lockers during the school day and confiscated on sight and stored in the school office until the end of the day. This month marks two years of phone bans being in operation in most Australian states. Victoria moved early, banning phones in public primary and secondary schools in 2020 . By term four, 2023, Western Australia Tasmania, New South Wales and South Australia had followed suit; Queensland restricted phones in term one, 2024. The announcement of the bans were lauded by parents and politicians, many of whom believed blocking access to phones would enhance focus and minimise distractions , while some experts were sceptical about their effectiveness . Now, two years on, what has actually happened in Australia’s phone-free schools? Phones belonging to students are stored in a container after being ‘checked-in’ at a NSW high school. Photograph: Steven Saphore/AAP “The impacts were clear,” says Peterson. “Since the ban, we’ve seen stronger lesson starts, fewer interruptions and better flow in teaching. Device-driven conflicts have fallen and recess and lunch look different now, [there are] more games, conversations and positive student-staff interactions. It’s the kind of atmosphere you actually want for young people.” One year after the ban was implemented, a survey of almost 1,000 public school principals led by the NSW Department of Education’s Centre for Education Statistics and Evaluation found that 95% of principals still supported the ban . Eighty-one per cent said the ban has improved students’ learning, 86% said it has improved socialisation among students and 87% believed students were less distracted in the classroom. Research from South Australia – released in March this year – revealed 70% of teachers reported increased focus and engagement during learning time and 64% of teachers reported “a lower frequency of critical incidents” at school as a result of device use. Ruqayah, who graduated from a western Sydney high school in 2024, thinks the bans were an “overreaction”. After going through high school with access to phones, she finished her final year with the phone ban in place and says fellow students were still finding ways to use them in secret. “Teenagers find their phones very important,” she says. “It makes them feel secure and safe, so taking away something that is important to them just causes more stress and more worry which makes situations worse at school and harder for teachers, supervisors [and] support workers to deal with.” Some students believe removing phones from classrooms limited people’s ability to cheat. Photograph: Mike Bowers/The Guardian However, anecdotal conversations with other students and staff at both public and private schools shows widespread belief the bans have had a positive impact. One high school teacher, who did not wish to be named, says the mere presence of phones in the classroom could be distracting, even if they were not used. “They just present an opportunity,” she says. “We do see a difference without them.” Some students feel the bans levelled the school playing field. Amy, a year 11 student from a western Sydney public high school, says the removal of phones from classrooms has limited people’s ability to cheat while also offering social benefits for those who she said were “chronically online”. “Students [are more comfortable] as it creates safe space and they’re not worried about a photo of them being sent around,” she says. Mariam, a year 11 student at a public high school in southern Sydney, says although the students at her school found the phone ban to be “unreasonable” and felt that teachers “sometimes used the ban as a way to abuse their power”, she believed it had a positive impact on her learning. Aisha, a year 11 student from a private Islamic school in western Sydney, says the phone bans at her school helped her “gain a longer attention span and perform better at school”. The absence of phones has also significantly reduced opportunities for in-class cyberbullying or harassment This increased focus is something that Dr Tony Mordini, the principal of Melbourne high school, a selective public school, has seen first-hand. Melbourne high adopted a phone ban policy in January 2020 in compliance with the Victorian Department of Education’s directive. “From a professional perspective, the ban has had a clear positive impact,” he says. “Students are more focused during lessons, and we’ve seen a reduction in distractions caused by online activity. The absence of phones has also significantly reduced opportunities for in-class cyberbullying or harassment.” But Mordini says the phone bans have also meant fewer opportunities for students. “It’s important to acknowledge what we’ve lost,” he says. “Phones can be incredibly powerful learning tools – capable of storing large amounts of content, supporting research, taking photos, creating videos and hosting useful apps. Their absence means we’ve had to rely more on school-provided devices and traditional resources.” skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Breaking News Australia Get the most important news as it breaks Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But one of the main drivers of these bans was undoubtedly that they were popular.” He says schools can be a proxy for broader concerns about children and their use of devices, but he’s sceptical about schools being the best approach. “Young people spend way more time outside school, so really we should be talking about how parents and families regulate their children’s device use at home,” he says. “Unfortunately, this isn’t something that most politicians want to do. So, school phone bans are a relatively pain-free way for people to feel that they are doing something about the wider problems we have with excessive digital device use.” Selwyn says phone bans in Australia were not set up “with the intention of properly testing their effectiveness” and says concrete research in this area is “inconclusive, and … not particularly rigorous”. He also believes the latest government data from NSW and South Australia is “not particularly insightful”. “The key question is how these bans play out over time,” he says. “Claiming that these bans are suddenly leading to dramatic improvements makes for a neat political soundbite, but we need a lot more in-depth and sustained investigation of what effects these bans are actually having. “We need to do a lot better than simply asking principals whether they think students’ learning has improved. In particular, we need to go into classrooms and talk with students and teachers about their different experiences with the bans and what they think would be beneficial going forward.” He cites a recent UK research from 30 schools and more than 1,200 students which “found no significant differences for students attending schools with smartphone bans in terms of their mental wellbeing, sleep, education performance in English and maths or even disruptive classroom behaviour”. ‘Phone bans aren’t a silver bullet, but they are a critical lever,’ says Peterson. Photograph: Dan Peled/AAP “You will find some studies which point out correlations between phone bans and improvements in learning, but these cannot be seen as providing reliable evidence of direct causal relationships,” he says. “It is naive to think that a phone ban is going to directly and significantly shift the dial on any of these issues in and by itself.” Peterson says he’s careful not to “oversell” the bans, but says they are about “creating conditions where learning and friendships can actually thrive”. While his school has made exemptions for medical management, disability support or assistive and translation apps, he believes academic flow is stronger, conflicts rarer and social cohesion better. “Wellbeing data” at his school has shown “reductions in psychological distress”. “Phone bans aren’t a silver bullet,” he says. “But they are a critical lever, especially when paired with digital citizenship, mental-health promotion and positive playground programs.” Peterson says many students have suggested the ban gives them “a break”. “The phone ban is now simply the norm and the gains are real, modest and worth it.”",https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/oct/13/two-years-after-school-phone-bans-were-implemented-in-australia-whats-changed-the-impacts-were-clear,Society,BBC,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/be645ca6e8e93a30ae127cf53605261789e1b768/339_0_4027_3222/master/4027.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=b7b3c7d263378445cc0f19ff70bccec4",2025-10-12T14:00:57+00:00,3e3aff9b07af58b2289224bfd190b61a766f02db
6d7bdfe720d8,Georgia’s story: how a domestic abuse victim’s suicide was ruled an unlawful killing by her partner,,"On 26 April 2020 Georgia Barter, a long-term victim of domestic abuse, died in hospital after taking a fatal overdose of painkillers. Last week, in an extraordinary verdict, a coroner ruled that Georgia, 32, was unlawfully killed by her abusive partner. A court heard how GPs, nurses and police officers all had chances to intervene in Thomas Bignell’s violent campaign against Georgia, but failed to do so. At the conclusion of the hearing, there were gasps in the courtroom. It is believed to be only the second time in English legal history that a coroner has reached such a conclusion in the case of a suicide following domestic abuse, and the first time without a jury. The coroner said she could not be certain whether Georgia intended to take her own life; she had told her mother that she just wanted the “physical and mental pain to stop”. The CPS has previously said there is insufficient evidence to bring charges. But Georgia’s family want this to be reconsidered following the coroner’s ruling that her death was unlawful. Bignell did not attend the inquest and when police tried to bring him in under a warrant, they couldn’t find him This is Georgia’s story. “She had this amazing halo of golden curls,” Kay Barter says of her daughter. “Which she hated, and everybody loved. The lollipop man at primary school used to call her Shirley Temple.” As mother and daughter, they were incredibly close. Georgia, she recalls, was “very loving, very kind, and caring”. “She’d ring me every day from work, three or four times a day, to see how I was. She’d always tell me, every phone call, ‘I love you, Mum.’” Entering her early 20s, Georgia had a big group of friends, who she enjoyed going out with at night. She was close to her two sisters, and loved spending time with her family. Thomas Bignell Georgia had been a painfully shy child, so, at the age of four, Barter enrolled her in dance lessons. “And she shone,” Barter says. “She loved it from the first lesson, and she gained in confidence because of that, and her happy time was being on stage and performing. “She won many, many medals over the years, but that was never who Georgia was. She just wanted to take part, she just loved being up there.” Georgia dreamed of being a professional dancer but knew the odds were against her, so she began working in recruitment instead. But, Barter says, “she always regretted not carrying on with her [dance] career”. Georgia was also generous to a fault. She once noticed lots of small transactions leaving her bank account every month, and didn’t know where the money was going, until she realised they were all the charities she had signed up to donate to. And “she was so funny”, Barter says. “She was an amazing mimic, and we used to say she could be a standup comedian. Her sense of humour was just fantastic. She used to have us all in hysterics.” When Georgia was 19, she was sexually assaulted by a man after a night out. Her attacker was later convicted and jailed, but Georgia was deeply affected by the assault, found the the trial traumatic – particularly cross-examination by his defence counsel – and was later diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder, anxiety and depression. Not long after, she was introduced to Bignell, then going by the name Ryan Johnson, by a friend, and the pair began a relationship, which, her mother says, quickly became very intense. The inquest at East London coroner’s court heard that throughout their 11-year on-off relationship, Georgia was subjected to domestic abuse and coercive control. “There were many, many times throughout the relationship where I noticed he had marked Georgia,” Barter told the court. “He thought nobody could see it.” Once, she says, her daughter “looked like a victim of a road traffic accident”. Barter told the court that Georgia was controlled by Bignell financially. He would move her to live in different places, she would be forced to quit jobs and he would deprive her of basic necessities, such as food, hot water and electricity. Georgia Barter as a child Evidence from a paramedic, James Lambert, detailed how Georgia had been taken to hospital in April 2020 after she told her sister she had taken an overdose. Lambert’s notes, read to the court, said she told him Bignell had kicked her and stamped on her face; her injuries were consistent with her description, the court heard. Lambert said Georgia had bruising on her arm consistent with grab marks. Addressing Lambert, as she read from his statement, the assistant coroner Dr Shirley Radcliffe said: “She told you he’d done this before, and was a violent man.” It was not the first time medics had treated injuries Georgia said were caused by Bignell. A few weeks earlier, the court heard, she had arrived at a hospital in Kent bleeding, having told ambulance staff that Bignell had sexually assaulted her. Georgia left the hospital with the cannula still in her arm; it is believed she left with Bignell, the inquest heard. Hospital staff phoned Georgia and asked her to return, but she did not. The police were not informed. A nurse did make a safeguarding referral, which resulted in a call from a domestic abuse charity, but not until several weeks later. A spokesperson for East Kent hospitals said: “We offer our condolences to Georgia Barter’s family.” In 2012, Surrey police were called to reports that Bignell had hit and kicked Georgia at a hotel. He was arrested and taken into custody, but was not charged in relation to the alleged assault. A spokesperson for Surrey police said they were not a named party in the inquest but “we will review any findings from the coroner if they are shared [with] our force”. The inquest heard the Met and Essex police received multiple reports about Bignell’s alleged abuse of Georgia, including once when a member of the public told Essex police that Bignell had made threats to kill Georgia. Although Bignell was arrested several times, he was never charged with any violent offences against Georgia. A spokesperson for Essex police said on one of its three contacts with Georgia “the service provided by officers did not reach the incredibly high standards we would expect”. “At the conclusion of Georgia’s inquest, the coroner did not suggest any failings by Essex police caused or contributed to her death but did highlight missed opportunities from police forces and health organisations,” the spokesperson said. “In the six years since Essex police attended the third of the three incidents, we have made significant strides in the identification, awareness and response to coercive and controlling behaviour.” Bignell had at least one conviction related to violence against another woman, however no disclosures were made to Georgia under Clare’s law, which allows police forces to provide women with information about a partner’s violent past. And when he was arrested in relation to alleged assaults on Georgia, officers apparently did not have either the capacity or the authorisation to check the police national database, so were not aware of the full extent of his alleged offending history across at least four police areas. After Georgia’s death, Bignell was investigated again and the Metropolitan police passed a file to the CPS, but it declined to charge him with any offences due to insufficient evidence. After Georgia’s family requested a review of the case, again, the CPS did not authorise charges. Research found that 2024 was the second year in a row where suicides following domestic abuse outnumbered homicides by partners As the details of the couple’s relationship were laid out before the coroner, what appears to be a litany of missed opportunities emerged. Bignell was due to give evidence at the inquest into Georgia’s death but he did not appear. A bench warrant for his attendance was issued but, the court heard, police had not been able to find him. His mother, Lesley, gave evidence, saying she had never witnessed any abuse of Georgia by her son. “It’s shocking if it’s true,” she told the inquest. “But I can’t believe that, knowing Tom as a character and a person.” The Guardian was not able to reach Thomas Bignell for comment. Georgia had reported the domestic abuse with several different health services. At no point in the years before her death was a multi-agency risk assessment conference referral made – a meeting of professionals designed to safeguard someone at risk from serious domestic abuse. Such referrals can be made without the consent of the person concerned. In March 2020, Georgia visited a GP, Dr Jakir Ullah, and disclosed that she had been assaulted by her boyfriend. He offered to make a safeguarding referral, he told the court, but Georgia declined, and he said he did not want to make one against her wishes. The year before, she had disclosed domestic abuse to another GP, Dr Philomina Mridha, who, again, had not made a safeguarding referral. Georgia had been referred to mental health services, but was on a waiting list for individual therapy. She had been offered group therapy, but did not feel this was suitable. “In that situation,” Barter says, “the last thing you want is to sit in a room full of strangers, and she was just put on another waiting list. “Also, she was assessed by the mental health team, and that’s when she was put on a six-month-plus waiting list, and she was advised to read a self-help book by Jeffrey Young, How to Reinvent Your Life.” A spokesperson for the East London NHS foundation trust said: “We have reviewed the coroner’s report and acknowledge matters of concern raised. “We remain fully committed to learning from lessons in relation to mental health assessments and monitoring of risk while people are awaiting interventions.” The umbrella of public services that was meant to protect Barter’s daughter failed to do so, she says. “The failings are systemic.” Police officers and health professionals, she believes, failed to understand the extent of the impact that domestic abuse and coercive control can have on a woman’s life, health and presentation. Barter says that, as a result of the abuse, Georgia had turned to alcohol, and often when the police turned up, she and Bignell had been drinking. This, Barter believes, is in part why her daughter’s cries for help were dismissed. “I believe there’s a systemic failure in the police force, not just in London, everywhere, and I believe that these young women, they’re judged,” she says. “Georgia said she felt judged. She felt ashamed and judged, and this is what the police forces made these women feel like. “I still believe a lot of police officers believe these women are just as bad, because if they weren’t, why don’t they leave? If only they realised, if only they understood, the impact of coercive control on these women.” The coroner stated: “On or around 5 April 2020 [Georgia] had been assaulted by her long-term partner, who had been violent towards her on a number of occasions during their relationship. “There was clear evidence of her being an individual with a psychiatric history of post-traumatic stress disorder, anxiety and depression which had been exacerbated by her partner’s behaviour.” The order of service for Georgia Barter’s funeral Inquests have a different burden of proof to criminal courts, finding on the balance of probabilities, rather than the criminal threshold of beyond reasonable doubt. There is no criminal due process and nobody is convicted or acquitted. Bignell has not been charged with or convicted of any offences in criminal court in relation to his alleged violence towards Georgia or her death. Last year, research found that for the second year in a row, suicides following domestic abuse had outnumbered homicides by partners. The Domestic Homicide Project found that in the year to March 2024, 98 people were suspected to have killed themselves after experiencing domestic abuse, while 80 people were killed by a partner during the same period. Barter wants Bignell to face criminal prosecution for the alleged abuse of Georgia and her death. And she wants police and prosecutors in all cases to make more effort to prosecute alleged perpetrators of domestic abuse before a death. “Justice hasn’t been done,” she says. “Justice hasn’t been served and he’s still a danger to women. He’s been doing this for so long, and there’s so many vulnerable young women out there, and the fact that he’s a DJ, he’ll have the opportunity to meet many young women. “The law must be changed and these suicides must be recognised for what they are. It’s not suicide. These women are crying out in pain. They need to investigate why these women have become so desperate. “I hope this brings much-needed change, and the connection between domestic abuse and coercive control and suicide. This isn’t suicide; this is manslaughter. “And there are so many women that have lost their lives, and they’re too quick to put a label of suicide; they need to look at the bigger picture.” Thomas Bignell There have only been a handful of cases in which the CPS has sought to bring a prosecution for manslaughter in such circumstances. The most recent was that of Keina Dawes. The 23-year-old hairdresser killed herself after two years of domestic abuse and violence , leaving a note on her phone that read: “I was murdered. Ryan Wellings killed me,” referring to her former partner. After a six-week trial this year, Wellings was cleared of manslaughter but found guilty of assault and coercive and controlling behaviour, and jailed for six-and-a-half years. After the case, the assistant commissioner Louisa Rolfe, the National Police Chiefs’ Council lead for domestic abuse, said police forces would seek to charge more domestic abusers with manslaughter after their partners took their own lives. Kate Ellis, from the Centre for Women’s Justice, said: “It is suspected that more women actually take their own lives following domestic abuse than are killed by their partners – yet there is a serious failure on the part of authorities to record domestic abuse-related suicides, and there have been hardly any prosecutions for this crime.” It is believed there has only been one successful prosecution of this kind. In 2017, Nicholas Allen, then 47, was given a 15-year extended sentence for the manslaughter of Justene Reece , 46, who took her own life. She had left a note saying she had “run out of fight” after six months of threats from Allen, who had stalked her after she left him and moved to a women’s refuge. At the conclusion of Georgia’s inquest, Radcliffe issued a prevention of future deaths report , expressing concerns about the failures in the use of the police national database. “There is difficulty for frontline officers in police forces across the country to easily access the police national database to check on individuals who are suspected of domestic abuse,” she wrote. “They are unable to easily identify if the individual has a history of reported domestic abuse in areas outside that force’s borders.” The conclusion marked a key point in the years-long battle for change and justice that Barter has shouldered since her daughter’s death. The family’s solicitor, Clare Hayes, says: “The coroner’s finding of unlawful killing makes it a matter of public record that Georgia died as a result of domestic abuse. “At the inquest, Georgia’s family endured harrowing evidence about the abuse that Georgia suffered over untold years and the barriers to escaping a coercive and controlling relationship. “It is vital that the police and other public services, including health, are galvanised into taking positive, affirmative action to disrupt domestic abuse and offer victims multi-agency support and protection and meaningful escape routes to safety from abuse.” “To everyone, it’s five years [since Georgia’s death],” says Barter. “To me, it’s yesterday. It’ll always be yesterday. It’ll always be my yesterday for the rest of my life. My daughters, they’ve not only lost their beloved sister, they’ve lost their mum, my grandsons have lost their nan. My family is broken.” Frank Mullane, the chief executive of Advocacy After Fatal Domestic Abuse, a family support charity, says: “I acknowledge Georgia’s suffering and that she tried hard to get help. And I salute Georgia’s mother, Kay, and her family for being so resolute and determined. “As is the case so often, it’s the work of a family seeking justice that ensures justice happens. Their tenacity and measured pressure on public protection services to improve will undoubtedly save lives. And they have ensured that more inquests will conclude that some suicides after domestic abuse are unlawful killings.” DCI Jim Mitchell, from the Met’s north east command unit, says: “While the coroner made no specific criticism of police actions within their findings, we are aware of their intention to write to the Home Office to understand plans to overhaul the police national database. We welcome any changes that make the system a more useful tool for police forces to share information. “As part of an investigation following Ms Barter’s death, the Met investigated all available lines of inquiry and provided a detailed file of evidence to the CPS. Ultimately, it was deemed there was insufficient evidence to pursue this case. We appealed this decision but it was upheld.” A CPS spokesperson said: “These matters underwent rigorous scrutiny by experienced prosecutors. Several offences were considered on our initial review of the evidence presented by police, but we concluded our evidential test for prosecution was not met.” A Home Office spokesperson said: “Our thoughts are with Georgia’s family and friends at this time. “There is currently an ongoing cross departmental review on modernising policing intelligence systems, including the police national database. Our forthcoming Violence Against Women and Girls Strategy will also seek to overhaul the criminal justice response to ensure that more victims are protected and more perpetrators are punished.” The coroner’s historic verdict, says Barter, “is what I was hoping for but I never thought, never thought”. She says she hopes it will lead to greater understanding of issues around coercive control, and ultimately to more men being held accountable. “It’s about all these young women out there that are suffering this abuse,” she says. “And I know my darling Georgia, she’d want to help these women. “If there’s one thing that can come out of our horror and heartbreak, it’s change; to save these young women and girls from the epidemic of domestic abuse and coercive control, because it is, it’s an epidemic.” “All I can hope for now,” she says, “is that my beautiful girl’s death will bring change, and save women’s lives.”",https://www.theguardian.com/society/ng-interactive/2025/oct/11/georgias-story-how-a-domestic-abuse-victims-suicide-was-ruled-an-unlawful-killing-by-her-partner,Society,BBC,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2d0c4effd596b02fe3d173f829b9d52ce7c6ddf7/1_0_4998_4000/master/4998.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=215f3202bf5996712bc49d9100eb0f0b",2025-10-11T16:00:27+00:00,66e3d5e476c35221b63d5c972c8cd37b6b26d2d0
f39106ea967d,Revealed: Labour-run council using legal loophole to serve families with no-fault evictions,,"A Labour-run council is using a legal loophole to issue dozens of families with no-fault evictions, despite Keir Starmer’s manifesto pledge to outlaw the practice. Scrapping no-fault evictions “immediately” was one of Labour’s main manifesto pledges before its 2024 election win, but more than a year on, the party’s flagship renters’ rights bill has not been made law. Local authorities cannot normally carry out no-fault evictions – known officially as section 21 evictions – as they apply to tenancies issued by private landlords. However, Lambeth council in south London has been able to start eviction proceedings against 63 households because it created an arm’s-length body to manage some of its housing stock. Five families have already been issued with possession orders via the courts and two of those have had their homes repossessed by bailiffs. Another 24 have left properties voluntarily after receiving a section 21 notice. Internal council documents seen by the Guardian suggest that council officials have been planning to regain possession of the properties since at least 2023, but the full implementation of the scheme was delayed until after last year’s election. An internal briefing document from March 2024 read: “Advice received from democratic and legal services [is] that this is a key decision and it is too controversial to take during the pre-election period.” Plans to evict the tenants were made despite the fact Lambeth council wrote to the Conservative government in 2019, asking it to end no-fault evictions. The tenancies were overseen by Homes for Lambeth, a group of companies wholly owned by the council. It was established in 2017 as part of an estate regeneration scheme. As part of this initiative, the local authority bought back some properties from residents who had purchased former council houses at a discount as part of the right-to-buy scheme introduced by Margaret Thatcher’s government in 1980. The council then transferred these properties to Homes for Lambeth. This meant they were able to be rented on the private market, despite ultimately being owned by the local authority. At its peak, Homes for Lambeth managed about 200 properties across six estates. However, Homes for Lambeth is now being disbanded due to concerns over poor performance after an independent review by former senior civil servant Bob Kerslake in 2022. Kerslake recommended that management of the Homes for Lambeth stock be brought back “in house” to improve efficiency. About 100 of the homes were vacated voluntarily before eviction notices were issued. The council is now using legal measures in an attempt to regain possession of the remaining properties. In internal documents, it said this would help it meet the “most urgent” housing needs in the borough, including accommodating vulnerable families who needed temporary housing after being made homeless. Some residents tried to challenge the decision in court, but in June a judge ruled that current laws do not prevent councils from setting up companies to issue private tenancies. Jules Zakolska, 27, who received a section 21 notice in April, has been at the forefront of efforts to fight the decision on behalf of the affected residents. She said some have been driven to the brink of suicide by the stress. Zakolska said she and her partner, July Kaliszewska, 24, had also suffered severe mental health issues as they faced the prospect of their home being repossessed by bailiffs. Zakolska, a university social sciences student, has lived in the property in Clapham with Kaliszewska, a bar manager, for three years. She is autistic and suffers from fibromyalgia, a chronic condition that causes pain and fatigue. She says she is “traumatised” by the prospect of ending up in temporary accommodation. She said: “Lambeth just doesn’t care. It says it wants to provide housing for the most vulnerable people, but if it makes us homeless, we will become those people. They have created this issue and traumatised us. It’s not right. I’m struggling. Who wouldn’t be, with the prospect of becoming homeless? It’s taken over my life.” A Lambeth council spokesperson said: “With almost 5,000 vulnerable homeless Lambeth families staying in often poor-quality temporary accommodation every night, there are incredibly difficult choices to be made. To do nothing would ignore their plight. “When the opportunity arose we chose, legally, to use properties we own to house the homeless rather than rent them out privately on a short-term basis. “The majority of these homes have been returned to the council. We have supported tenants who needed help through this process, while successfully giving dozens of homeless families a roof over their heads. “This situation is just one example of what long-term structural underfunding of council services, the national failure to build the homes we need, and the ongoing housing crisis looks like on the frontline. “The high cost of housing in Lambeth and across inner city London is a huge driver of deprivation – a point we are working hard to communicate to government.” A spokesperson for the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government said: “We need to do everything we can to support people out of homelessness and we are open to new approaches on this. “We are spending £1bn on homelessness and building 1.5m homes, so we can tackle the housing crisis we inherited and help councils like Lambeth manage housing need in their areas.”",https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/oct/11/lambeth-council-legal-loophole-no-fault-evictions,Society,BBC,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3359343504e7dc51ab70643e89370e0b4de0cf62/683_0_6827_5464/master/6827.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=f8966e1b9662cd3746ac12cf280296ee",2025-10-11T11:17:33+00:00,768cf413f805716b220f4b3d236c5ea1d88e9d3d

1075bed35d2e,High street slot machine shops pay staff bonuses linked to how much gamblers lose,,"High street slot machine shops are paying their staff bonuses linked to how much gamblers lose, the Guardian has learned, prompting condemnation of the “appalling” reward scheme from MPs and campaigners. A network of 1,451 “adult gaming centres” (AGCs), most of which are open 24 hours a day, has spread through the UK in recent years, concentrated in the most economically deprived areas . Amid booming revenues, the German-owned Merkur posted a £15m profit for 2024, while Admiral Slots paid its Austrian owner a £10m dividend last year, according to accounts posted at Companies House this week. It can now be revealed that the growth of at least one of the sector’s leading players has been partly fuelled by incentive schemes that unlock bonuses in return for hitting key targets. At Merkur, these targets include revenues from punters’ losses on highly addictive slot machines. For venue managers at Merkur, most of the bonus – worth up to 80% of annual salary – is linked to “controllable profit”, according to one internal document setting out the scheme’s structure. This measure is partly determined by outgoings on wages and smaller items designed to keep customers playing, such as complimentary food, drinks and “cash giveaways”. But the first item on the list of factors contributing to controllable profit is “net revenues”. In effect, this means takings from the shops’ slot machines, which offer stakes of £2 every 1.5 seconds, for a maximum jackpot of £500. The machines have been linked in successive studies to higher rates of addiction than most other gambling formats. Jackie Olden, whose late mother lost thousands of pounds at a branch of Merkur in Stockport. Photograph: Joel Goodman/The Guardian Jackie Olden had campaigned for tougher regulations on AGCs, after her late mother, who was terminally ill, lost thousands of pounds at a branch of Merkur in Stockport. The company was fined nearly £100,000 earlier this year for social responsibility failings, after reporting by the Guardian. “It feels like a punch in the face that my mum might have been helped, but the staff may have been financially motivated not to stop her,” Jackie said. “It feels like the fine they received has taught them nothing.” Merkur said it “strongly rejects” any suggestion that its incentive scheme undermines safer gambling objectives. Lawyers for the company pointed out that a portion of the controllable profit bonus, equivalent to 20% of salary, can be lost if shops fail to hit performance targets, which include completing safer gambling training. The bonus also includes a separate element – worth up to 20% of salary – based on reaching “compliance and audit” targets. These are understood to include a “safer gambling” element involving bosses asking junior staff about their interactions with customers. Lawyers for the company said extra safer gambling elements had been added to the bonus scheme in January 2025 and had resulted in more interactions with customers. But MPs from across the political spectrum raised concerns about the potential moral hazard created by any incentive scheme linked to revenues from slot machines. They said this could give AGC staff, some of whom earn minimum wage, a reason to look the other way when vulnerable people are racking up huge losses. Iain Duncan Smith, the former Conservative leader who now campaigns for gambling reform, said that even though an element of the bonus was linked to safer gambling targets, the overall scheme looked like “an incentive not to intervene” when punters are losing sums they cannot afford. He said it appeared that firms were “paying cynical lip service to their ‘obligation’ to stop harmful gambling. Appalling.” The Labour MP Dawn Butler, who is bidding to become London’s next mayor, said: “The payment of these bonuses seems to completely contradict statements from these companies about their commitments to social responsibility. “This bonus structure should immediately be changed. It also begs a question as to why the Gambling Commission allows these practices by AGCs in the first place.” Her fellow Labour MP, Alex Ballinger, said the scheme “shows a complete lack of responsibility and the urgent need for greater regulation”. In 2020, the Gambling Commission told operators to stop paying bonuses to staff working on controversial “VIP schemes” for high-value customers, meaning those who lose a lot of money. But it said these rules do not apply to how staff are paid in AGCs, despite the fact that punters can easily lose hundreds of pounds an hour. skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Business Today Get set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morning Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Photograph: William Barton/Alamy One former Merkur staff member told the Guardian that the opportunity to make extra income meant staff were less likely to perform “safer gambling interactions”. These interventions, a condition of having a licence to operate in Great Britain, include recommending customers take a break when they have suffered heavy losses or appear distressed. “Staff are not inclined to break the game with a customer that is losing a lot of money because they think that will add to the income,” they said. “I have seen it on many occasions when staff members decide to leave the customer alone when he is losing. “At the end of the day, the company is trying to make profit and for that the customer needs to lose.” One former staff member at Merkur said the maximum bonus of 100% of salary was impossible to achieve in practice. They added that junior staff get smaller sums, up to £315 every month. The bonus scheme used to be more generous but was changed in January this year, they said. The Guardian understands that other big companies in the sector operate similar bonus schemes. Annual accounts for Admiral’s two leading UK trading companies show combined revenues up 12% to more than £300m last year, while combined pre-tax profit climbed 16% to £46.3m. The accounts also state that “remuneration packages include performance incentives and other benefits”. The company did not respond to a request for more information about its bonus scheme. A spokesperson for Merkur said: “We strongly reject any suggestion that our incentive schemes conflict with our obligations to protect customers or that they in any way discourage staff from carrying out safer gambling interactions. “All our bonus structures are designed to recognise a range of operational and compliance metrics, including strict safer gambling, audit and training requirements. “Merkur is committed to ensuring a safe, responsible and enjoyable environment for all customers and to maintaining the highest standards of integrity and compliance across all our venues.” Bacta, the trade body for AGCs, said: “Bacta does not issue specific guidance on staff bonus schemes, but all members operate in a highly regulated environment and are required under our social responsibility charter to ensure that all commercial practices support compliance with safer gambling and social responsibility obligations.”",https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/oct/10/high-street-slot-machine-shops-pay-staff-bonuses-linked-to-how-much-gamblers-lose,Society,BBC,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f6f947e83eae0faf09d76f487ce04da8d4cce669/805_0_6713_5373/master/6713.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=e245ae68cc1ce762425b9c2be423c1bb",2025-10-10T13:06:50+00:00,85fd6650c6749a3fee898212ec844ce6784ce303
fad214e34999,"Female athletes have faster reaction times on day they ovulate, study finds",,"Female athletes have reaction times 80 milliseconds faster and make fewer mistakes on the day they ovulate, according to research . Researchers at University College London (UCL) studied how different stages of the menstrual cycle and levels of activity affected women’s brain function. They tracked 54 women aged 18 to 40 not using hormone-based contraception and grouped them according to how much exercise they took: inactive (reported not taking part in any form of structured exercise), recreationally active (taking part in at least two hours of structured exercise a week), competing in any sport at club level, and elite (competing in any sport at national or international level). They then completed cognitive tests and reported their mood and symptoms on the first day of menstruation, two days after the end of menstruation (late follicular phase), the first day ovulation was detected, and between ovulation and menstruation (mid-luteal phase). The study, published in Sports Medicine – Open, found that women perform best on cognitive tests when they ovulate, with on average participants reacting about 30 milliseconds faster compared with later in their cycle and making fewer mistakes. But for elite athletes, the difference in performance was much more pronounced. On average, their attention and inhibition scores were more than 120 milliseconds faster, and their simple reaction time was 80 milliseconds faster at ovulation than the luteal phase of their cycle. Dr Flaminia Ronca, the lead author of the study from UCL Surgery and Interventional Science and the Institute of Sport, Exercise and Health, said: “At an elite level, 80 milliseconds slower reaction times makes a big difference and in a fast-paced sport like rugby, it could put you at greater risk of concussion or serious musculoskeletal injury.” At the other end of the exercise spectrum, the authors also found that compared with active participants (at whatever level), inactive participants had reaction times on average about 70 milliseconds slower and made about three times as many impulsive errors, regardless of cycle phase. This difference could determine whether we regain balance after tripping over an obstacle or not, the study said. “This shows the importance of incorporating some form of recreational physical activity into our lives,” Ronca said. “It doesn’t have to be that intense or competitive to make a difference – and crucially, it’s something that we can control.” Responding to the findings, Stephanie Hilborne, the chief executive of Women in Sport said: “While it is fascinating to understand the tiny cognitive supercharging that happens the day of ovulation, the most interesting conclusion is around the cognitive benefits of being active. “Having the time to register and respond to a risk is the difference between having a fall or righting yourself. For women in wiser life, avoiding falls is especially vital given the huge gendered health inequality around osteoporosis with one in two women over 50 suffering from this, compared to one in nine men. “We already knew being active can build bone strength and now we know being active can increase our response times. This report adds a second layer of urgency to get women active and address the tragedy and cost of fragility fractures.”",https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/oct/10/female-athletes-faster-reaction-times-day-ovulate-study,Society,BBC,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8fd6ab4a1b17375991c7fd5379662c09a7197a07/0_0_4183_3346/master/4183.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=992fb68879362549d754812e48696f72",2025-10-10T00:00:38+00:00,3d66f3b53f515b56aa7c0c9f4daef4239bcdd8dd
7febaefbe710,"After 40 years as an autistic person in the workplace, I realised it was OK to ask for changes",,"A lthough I started my first full-time job when I was 15, it was more than three decades before I asked for an accommodation at work. This was not because I didn’t want or need changes in my workplace. I had struggled with aspects of the workplace since my first job at the age of 15. I knew that the bright lights in my office and in meeting rooms made it difficult to concentrate and gave me severe migraines. I knew that the artificial air blowing through the air conditioning vents caused my skin to itch and made me feel ill. I knew that I struggled to shut out the background noise and focus on important conversations. But the idea that it didn’t have to be that way – or that it wasn’t that way for everyone else – was beyond my imagination. It was my gradual realisation that the struggles my autistic children experienced in the world mirrored my own, and my subsequent autism diagnosis at the age of 50 that made me realise my colleagues did not experience the workplace in the way that I did. But I accepted if I wanted to work, I had to tolerate being in a workplace that was doing me harm. Working in Melbourne during the Covid-19 lockdowns was an absolute game-changer for me, as it was for many autistic (and non-autistic) people. My home town was famous for being the most locked-down city in the world, with 262 days of restrictions that included “work from home where possible”. For the first time in the 17 years since I commenced in a leadership role, I wasn’t exhausted at the end of each day. I actually had enough energy to eat dinner with my family, to watch television with my husband in the evenings and to go for a walk with my sons on the weekend. I also got more work done than I had in years. My health began to improve. I felt calm, relaxed and happy. I was enjoying my work and I had remembered how to laugh. I was absolutely dreading the return to “normal”. Almost a year of working from home had given me a really clear sense, for the first time, of what it actually was that I found so challenging and exhausting about my job (and it wasn’t the work). It was the ongoing sensory challenges of bright lights, humming air conditioners and photocopiers, room temperature that I had no control over, clothes with seams and collars that itched and distracted. It was the constant social interaction, from endless meetings to small talk in the kitchen, always worrying whether I had properly interpreted the nuances of the conversation or misread a social cue. It was the ever-present need to mask my natural way of being to fit in; constantly reminding myself not to fidget, to make eye contact, not to speak or move or act in a way that was different to my neurotypical colleagues. Prof Sandra Thom-Jones, author of Austistics at Work. Photograph: Melbourne University Press Then, after almost 40 years in the workplace, I decided to ask for workplace accommodations. At the time I was working in a senior leadership position in a university, a role that required me to undertake a range of strategic planning tasks (which I felt comfortable with) and attend countless meetings and events (which I found exhausting). Finally I knew that I could ask; I had delivered numerous professional development training sessions where I had taught other managers about the importance of providing reasonable adjustments for autistic staff. I wasn’t afraid to ask; one week back in the office after 10 months working at home had shown me that the risks to my wellbeing of not asking were far more serious. And I knew exactly what I was going to ask for: all the things I had established in my work environment and routine when I had control over it that had enabled me to maintain my physical and mental wellbeing, and at the same time be considerably more productive. I was fortunate to be in a career that allowed me to have a reasonable amount of flexibility in my working arrangements and conditions, and to be in a sufficiently senior position to be able to control many aspects of my immediate work environment. Not everyone is in this situation. Some of the changes I made to my workspace were having dimmer switches installed in my office, having the air-conditioning vent disconnected, dimming the screen on my computer, purchasing a folding screen to go around my desk, getting a comfy reading chair in my favourite colour, and bringing fidget toys into my office. Some of the changes I made to my working conditions were wearing sunglasses or a cap when meeting in other people’s offices or meeting rooms, ensuring that my dietary needs were considered in catering for meetings and work functions, and negotiating to work from home two days per week. While some of my colleagues were initially surprised by the changes to my ways of working, they were largely accepting. What helped was having the words to explain why these adjustments were necessary and the support of my direct manager and my team. The visibility of my work adjustments, as a senior leader in the organisation, also empowered other autistic and neurodivergent staff to request the adjustments they needed. In my experience, it is useful to express the outcomes in terms of the benefits to both yourself and the organisation. For example, in my case: “The fluorescent lights in my office make it extremely difficult for me to focus on my work, and also give me intense headaches. Replacing lights will mean that I am able to focus on my work, be much more productive, and have fewer sick days due to light-induced migraines.” While some workplace adjustments require employers to invest in building modifications or purchase equipment, many reasonable adjustments can be implemented at minimal or no cost. They require simply that supervisors and colleagues are more understanding of the fact that autistic people experience the world differently from non-autistic people. For me, the biggest improvements in my wellbeing at work came from knowing that my colleagues accepted the ways that I needed to work – that I could wear my sunglasses in brightly lit rooms, wear my headphones in shared working spaces or excuse myself from a meeting if I was feeling overwhelmed. I would like to say that all of my colleagues were accepting of these changes, but the reality is that some were not. Many autistic people face barriers due to stereotypes and ableist assumptions, including the belief that the neurotypical way of working is the only right way. Every workplace, like every autistic person, is different; the challenges experienced and adjustments required will vary. However, the starting point for all workplaces is a genuine commitment to understanding the needs of autistic employees, and a willingness to create spaces where we can all work safely and comfortably.

Yes, obviously , we shouldn’t be dismissively taxonomising a whole gender like boxed Barbies. But in the era of tradwives and nu-gen gold diggers , in which the manosphere remains alive and kick(box)ing, telling teenage boys lies about women, I reckon there’s a way to go before we reach reductive objectification parity. Does that make it OK? No. Am I going to do it anyway? Yes, a bit. So, returning to the question, my answer is “like my coffee”: small, strong, dark and highly over-stimulating, brewed by my sister’s boyfriend in Scarborough … No, hang on, this is falling apart. Regardless, my ideal man is wildly at odds with the zeitgeist and my husband needs to punch up his protein intake and stop having opinions, because the New York Times claims a new dream man has dropped and he’s “beefy, placid and … politically ambiguous”. What do we know about the nouveau-neutral hunk? Well, apart from the essential 1:1 neck-to-head ratio and thighs like sequoias, he’s “sweetly naive, simple, almost oafish … unfazed by the byzantine requirements of modern masculinity, largely because he doesn’t know or care that they exist”. Grazia agrees, issuing an appreciation of what it is calling the “ Woke Jock ”: “As unremittingly blokey as he’s gentle”, the Woke Jock is comfortable with vulnerability and happy to be out-earned. Speaking of out-earning, the original placid beefcake – and the reason, surely, the archetype has merited NYT appraisal – is Mr Taylor Swift, Travis Kelce.

Built like Oak Furnitureland’s XXL wardrobe aisle, seemingly light on ego despite excelling at whatever a “tight end” does in American football, and touchingly delighted when Swift uses polysyllabic words, Kelce seems comfortable in his own skin in a way that’s very winning. Others include Channing Tatum (lauded for cheerfully telling a story about getting educated on director Akira Kurosawa by a video store employee) and evolved man-mountain Jason Momoa , who has declared: “I embrace the feminine side and also feel like I am OK to be vulnerable.” This is something of a turnaround. You may recall 2024’s “hot rat summer” (I paraphrase) when slight, rodenty men became pin-ups; or our recent collective yearning for the rumpled, thoughtful rizz of “daddy” Pedro Pascal . And we’re still laughing at an entirely different 2025 archetype: the performative male . If you were living under a rock all summer (enviable), let me explain: the much-satirised, tote bag-toting, ostentatiously David Foster Wallace-reading, hojicha-drinking, self-proclaimed feminist performative male is the anti-benign meathead. An over- rather than under-thinker, he’s self-aware to a fault, fashioning himself into what he believes women want – purely, the theory goes, to get into their pants. But apparently women want something quite different now. They’re concluding that Swift is right, as she is about many things: that cartoonish muscles and the ability to bench-press a grizzly bear can make for a partner who wears his masculinity lightly, with an identity that isn’t threatened by a successful, independent woman. That not having strong opinions means a restful absence of mansplaining.",https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/sep/07/a-new-dream-man-has-dropped-the-laid-back-confident-beefcake,Society,BBC,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2a66c130a98e892e7c09821f7eac4478b12e4b0a/781_0_4603_3682/master/4603.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=b63270abd10899c92a6628d7f3052b8d",2025-09-07T13:00:22+00:00,19806a4e73cabb84932391cf19d9d32890bddb8a
a48edc1e9c62,"‘You’re the only port of call for 400 hospital patients, which is absurd’: Matthew Hutchinson on the perils of life as an NHS doctor",,"A re You Really the Doctor?, Matthew Hutchinson’s memoir of being a black doctor in the NHS, opens in A&E with a patient suffering from a thunderclap headache and taking time out from his excruciating pain to complain that Hutchinson is “very scruffy”. “I’m wearing scrubs, the pyjama-like, hospital-issue uniform – something pretty difficult to put your own personal flair on,” Hutchinson writes, concluding wearily that the guy must have been reacting to something else: “Skin, hair, or general … vibe.” You couldn’t call it a microaggression, the patient’s assumption that, being black, Hutchinson was unlikely to be an expert. But this anecdote barely registers on the Geiger counter of bigotry in healthcare that Hutchinson writes about trenchantly and acerbically, from the prejudices doctors face from patients and the gender and race blindspots in medical textbooks, to the racism that could endanger a patient’s life ( black women are four times more likely to die during childbirth ). Meeting Hutchinson in the Guardian’s offices in London, he emanates forethought and competence. Even in shorts and a T-shirt, he seems like the kind of guy who couldn’t look scruffy if he tried. He says the book he’s written about race had to be done, but “I’ve spoken to people who are non-white and female, and without even prompting, they’ve said: ‘Actually, the thing that is held more against me is being a woman.’” Hutchinson’s wife, Louise, is a GP. “The lack of respect that can be shown to female doctors is outrageous, sometimes by certain other healthcare professionals, not even patients. In the same way, we haven’t really had a book, as far as I’m aware, about being disabled as a doctor and the lack of access to medical school for someone with a disability. I’ve met only one doctor with a hearing impairment in the entire time I’ve been working.” It’s a curse, being this fair-minded, stepping back from each point to look at every perspective, but it also gives an immediate sense of the kind of doctor he is. It speaks also to the speciality he’s chosen, rheumatology, which perhaps out of any field is the one that can cope with the most mystery: pain without a source. At 38, he is about to become a consultant. Hutchinson also does standup comedy, and his act and the writing ambitions that led to the book are the product of his years working as what used to be called a senior house officer in the NHS – the period before specialising – in the mid-2010s. It’s a time when “you’re becoming senior enough that people expect you to know what you’re doing, yet you’re still getting all the rubbish work. I was just a bit disaffected with medicine, wondering what other things I could do. Eventually, I did some standup, and just really got into it.” His routines started off as a softcore, leftie side-eye at the ridiculousness of politics, parenting, life and everything (Suella Braverman, “the Michael Jordan of multiculturalism”, railing against multiculturalism; Formula One being so white it’s amazing that Lewis Hamilton doesn’t get pulled over on the race track). The skills, he says, aren’t completely dissimilar to medicine: “Trying to get a room full of people on side to believe that you know what you’re doing.” The book is often a sharp-intake-of-breath funny (one medic on a dementia ward called it “veterinary medicine”), but doesn’t play it for laughs. He describes a situation like the grinding suffering of a lupus patient with such a close eye for detail that you feel as if you’re walking alongside him. A key preoccupation at medical school? Not being sent to an area where Reform are suddenly on the rise Hutchinson’s parents were both biochemists, now retired, and his younger brother is an anaesthetist. His dad arrived in Birmingham from Jamaica aged 19; his mother is Scottish. He grew up in south-east London, where he still lives, in an area that has gone from rough-with-leafy-pockets to only-just-affordable-on-two-doctors’-salaries. Not far from Eltham, where Stephen Lawrence was murdered, racism was hardly unheard of, but it wasn’t until Hutchinson went on a camping trip to Cornwall as a teenager that he discovered the unabashed bigotry of rural, monocultural Britain. Some local teenagers tried to pick a fight with him, uttering the bizarrely sinister line: “What are you doing here, dark horse?” The experience stayed with him when he decided to become a doctor, because in your first year of working, the NHS can send you anywhere. “That is one of your key preoccupations, almost from day one at medical school: how do I not get sent away? Even if it’s not being sent very far across the country, even just having to spend a year out of London in a place where suddenly Reform are on the rise, and there are St George crosses appearing everywhere and migrant hotels being burned down, that’s going to be a consideration.” There’s no easy solution – medics used to be placed according to a complex points system; now it’s done by lottery. Both methods have their critics, and “everywhere needs doctors,” Hutchinson says. He’s not trying to land an easy fix, merely noting that in the current environment, where politicians generate racial tension with their euphemistic “concerns about immigration” and endless discussions about whose anger is legitimate, you don’t often hear from the black healthcare professionals who have to go and live in that anger. Hutchinson performing at the Backyard Comedy Club, 2018. Photograph: Steve Cross In the event, he spent his first year in 2012 “at the bottom of that pyramid” (foundation year 1), in Essex. “I don’t think I could do now, as an experienced doctor, what I was asked to do in my first placement,” he says. As the general dogsbody of doctors, FY1s are often the only doctor doing out-of-hours ward cover. “Overnight, you’re the only port of call for about 400 medical beds which, given how sick these people are, is absurd. As a sort of crude estimate, 40 patients might need urgent care. And it’s you, the most junior person, turning up. It’s improved in some places, so you’ll have two registrars on overnight. I would still say the night shift is just doing as little as possible to the people who are already in hospital, to survive until the morning.” Things have changed since more than two decades ago, when junior doctors were famous for the inhuman length of the shifts they had to work; but every solution seems to create a new problem. Shorter shifts with longer rest breaks were phased into the 2016 junior doctors contract in England to accommodate the fact that even medics cannot survive on no sleep. Hutchinson found successive night shifts “very mentally destabilising, I get terrified of the notion of death. I’ve had that since I was 17 or 18, but I don’t think about it unless I’m sleep-deprived.” But despite junior doctors working shorter shifts, no extra staff were magicked up to fill the gap, so the result has been pervasive understaffing. Only during the pandemic, “when everyone got dragged out of elective care and out of clinic” did they suddenly have enough healthcare professionals in urgent care. “It’s probably some of the most well-staffed work I’ve ever done in my entire career,” he says. But there was a flipside, as there always seems to be. “What we’re seeing now is that it was a complete disaster for secondary care. It was then as if no other disease existed. So you found all these people 18 months later in a heap because their rheumatoid arthritis hadn’t been assessed and managed properly.” Cardiology attracts people who can be quite blunt, aggressive and have a high opinion of themselves Hutchinson has some pretty salty views about the other medical specialities, particularly cardiology, which attracts “people who can be quite blunt, aggressive, and have a high opinion of themselves”. His early years, first in Essex, later back in London, are peppered with incidents with cardiologists. Is it a class thing, I ask, considering the conveyor belt he describes: “If you pick your 18-year-old who wants to go to Imperial or Cambridge, most of them want to be brain surgeons, or want to be cardiac surgeons.” But no, “even now that there’s more diversity in the demographic, it’s still quite an aggressive speciality. Behaviour in the past was far worse, but those people haven’t gone away, they’ve just moderated their language. Having said that, I don’t want to give rheumatologists too much of an easy ride – there are plenty of abrupt rheumatologists.” In between surviving till dawn in Essex in his first year, to arriving back in London for his second foundation year – at a hospital he describes as “the kind of well-resourced centre of excellence where pampered professors carve out fiefdoms”, he met his wife at a party of his brother’s. They now have two children, one about to start pre-school, the other four months old. He has enormous respect for the work of GPs like his wife. “It’s such a difficult job, the idea that you can be expected to work out what’s a cold versus what’s the first signs of lung cancer in 10 minutes. The diversity of the work and the brevity of the appointments and the level of risk they’re expected to take on is ridiculous.” Rheumatology has totally different challenges, in particular, getting patients to describe the exact kind of pain they are in. In the book, his own descriptions of pain – from kidney stones to rheumatoid arthritis – are often so heartfelt and precise that it sounds more like poetry than work. “The nature of pain is often hugely diagnostically important,” he says, “so you do spend quite a lot of time ruminating on the specific nature of it. A thunderclap headache is literally like being hit in the head with the back of a hammer… cardiac chest pain is more like pressure or crushing. Sharp, stabbing pain may be more associated with a blood clot in the lungs. And words are obviously modulated by culture, language and background.” ‘The nature of pain is often hugely diagnostically important’ … Hutchinson. Photograph: David Levene/The Guardian Within medicine, rheumatologists are the people you call in when every other test has come up blank. “It’s quite closely coupled to immunology, a kind of highfalutin, investigative field of weird and wonderful diseases,” he says. But it’s also frustrating. “There are two ways you can do it. So you can say: my job is to make a binary decision. I either think you do have an immune-mediated inflammatory disease, in which case you’re my problem, or you just have chronic pain and some other non-immune-mediated thing, in which case you’re not my problem. Goodbye. I think that’s certainly what the managers probably want you to do, because it gets you through lots of patients.” The other way is to accept that your patient “may not have a disease that fits neatly into your of set of immune-mediated diseases. If you have the time to have a chat with them, maybe run 20 minutes late as a result, and say: ‘I understand you’re in pain, we can’t quite get to the bottom of it and I don’t want to give you a drug that’s gonna make you worse, but I still want to engage with the problem.’” From a patient’s perspective, just to feel as if someone has heard the pain is real is better than feeling written-off because they can’t find the cause. Yet to take that holistic view of a patient is to be constantly confronted by all the things you cannot solve. “You can give people the best kind of medical intervention they could hope for, but you’re still probably not going to be able to do everything else that’s going to be required for them to actually feel fulfilled and happy. You’re not going to fix the lift in their block, so they don’t have to walk up 20 flights of stairs with rheumatoid arthritis. That’s the other frustration.” Medicine has to operate in the conditions of the world around it, often with very little influence on that world. Take a cancer diagnosis – which, on the surface, might seem like a leveller. But if you take “someone who’s a multi-millionaire, and someone who’s living on a council estate – fine, they both have cancer, but the environments in which they’re having cancer are vastly different. The worries that they have for their children, their ability to attend appointments, these little things can change how you engage with your treatment.” Nowadays, Hutchinson spends three days a week in his clinic, and two days researching rheumatology and internal medicine at the Crick Institute in King’s Cross. If he has any nerves about the book coming out, it’s mainly whether or not cardiologists can take a joke. Being involved in the worlds of comedy and publishing “made me see that, actually, there are some really good things about medicine. When I see what other people are having to go through with their jobs, the certainty and the progression of the NHS looks great.” On the cusp of becoming a consultant, presumably braced for a new round of “are you really the consultant?”, he’s determined not to change his bedside or overall manner for the job. “A lot of people, when they become consultants, completely change the way they dress, come in suddenly wearing a brand new suit. I would imagine that’s mainly cardiologists.” Are You Really the Doctor? My Life as a Black Doctor in the NHS by Matthew Hutchinson, is published 4 September (£22, Blink Publishing).

640743d539e6,Is behaviour at work getting worse – or are we just becoming oversensitive snowflakes?,,"I would hate to be in human resources at the moment. Admittedly, as someone with no discernible people skills, I would always hate it, but I’ve been imagining the awkward HR meetings behind the scenes of the recent wave of “what is acceptable workplace behaviour” rulings from UK employment tribunals recently, and … oof! I’m thinking, particularly, of last week’s ruling on whether younger chatty workers disturbing an older colleague constitutes age discrimination (it didn’t), but there are many more. Comparing a colleague to Darth Vader in an online personality test resulted in a £30,000 compensation award. Leaving someone out of the tea round could contribute to unfair constructive dismissal. Sighing at a colleague could be discriminatory. An air kiss wasn’t harassment and neither was telling a manager his work was messy . Allocating a senior employee a “ low-status desk ” can be seen as a demotion. Of course, any acrimonious departure is about more than one thing. These are mostly cherrypicked contributory factors; easy headlines about situations that surely involved a complex brew of circumstances and personalities. But it does look like more cases considering how we should behave at work in quite granular ways are reaching tribunals. So, what’s going on? For a start, is workplace behaviour getting worse? That old “Covid meant we forgot our manners” cliche is certainly applied to workplaces – the idea being that too much time in slippers and sweats made us ruder and more self-centred, and we are now bringing rather too much of our unpalatable “whole selves” to work. But as a veteran of a variety of office environments, 1997-2010, I doubt this is the explanation. From flying office equipment to heavy lunchtime drinking and a litany of extremely off-colour personal comments, I witnessed some truly lawless behaviour (including from lawyers). People have never needed the excuse of a global pandemic to hang their sweaty shorts on the office door knob or make each other cry – there’s a reason I was congratulated by LinkedIn recently on my many years of self-employment. (OK, the reason is I was made redundant after writing about my colleagues on my blog – I didn’t say I was immune to behaving badly – but the stuff I saw certainly made me less keen to find another office-based job.) Actually, I suspect shifting mores (plus decades of anti-discrimination legislation) mean behaviour in most British workplaces is far better than it used to be. So, are we getting less tolerant of co-workers and the minor irritations sharing a workplace inevitably involve? These rulings are often framed as either “Gen Z are oversensitive snowflakes” or “today’s workers are lazy, cynical outrage-mongers looking for a payout”. On the former, there probably is a degree of generational friction – we have a highly intergenerational workforce ( 51% of businesses employ three or more generations ) and surveys suggest that has meant more age-based conflicts around communication style and working methods (it’s also something you often hear anecdotally). But most of these cases don’t even involve gen Z workers. The second complaint feels like a riff on the age-old, always fallacious “ nobody wants to work ” discourse, rehashed back through the 19th century and beyond (surely one day we’ll discover a Mesopotamian tablet on which someone has chiselled this exact complaint). People do want (and need) to work – just differently. Covid didn’t make us feral slobs, but it was an inflection point, showing that work need not be business as usual. Employees regularly express a desire for more work-life balance and flexibility, but instead, many employers are hustling them back on site , and an expanding culture of workplace surveillance (HSBC is the latest employer to go down this unpopular route according to a Reuters’ recent report ) further erodes trust and goodwill. Meanwhile, jobs that were traditionally vocations – teaching, healing, caring – are made harder and less rewarding every year by hollowed-out budgets. When you are not particularly happy at work – only one in three workers report they’re thriving and employee wellbeing is declining according to recent Gallup research – small grievances and annoyances become harder to overlook: the microwave smells worse; being left off the team bowling invitation rankles more; the no-headphones calls in the open plan office seem louder and longer. Unless and until things change, I bet the HR headaches continue.",https://www.theguardian.com/society/commentisfree/2025/aug/24/is-behaviour-at-work-getting-worse-or-are-we-just-becoming-oversensitive-snowflakes,Society,BBC,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/888c11b39dca6d5427550526c292aca4b61573f1/364_0_2010_1608/master/2010.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=bcb8f66edcabb50dca22239ea5a28181",2025-08-24T13:00:32+00:00,6ec1234852a487f661e6dc900f6fc507822e9ef5
2722844fbce9,"NHS could cease to function under Labour’s new visa rules, say nurses",,"The NHS and social care would cease to function under the government’s new rules to be imposed on foreign staff, nursing leaders have said, as hundreds of medics condemned the policy as “divisive and xenophobic”. In the most explicit attack yet on Labour’s proposed restrictions on overseas workers, the Royal College of Nursing (RCN) described the plan as “ignorant” and “pandering” to Nigel Farage’s Reform UK. Prof Nicola Ranger, the RCN general secretary, told the Guardian on Monday: “Health and care services would cease to function without migrant nursing staff. While other countries offer immediate paths to settlement for nurses, the UK is going in the opposite direction.” Labour is proposing to double the time that overseas workers will have to wait – from five to 10 years – before they can apply for indefinite leave to remain or claim any kind of benefit, including tax-free childcare, disability living allowance or housing support. The plans, outlined by the home secretary, Shabana Mahmood , at the Labour conference last week, would also mean foreign workers would have to volunteer in their local communities and pass a number of other existing tests to gain British citizenship. The proposals were first outlined the government’s immigration white paper in May and are seen as a direct response to the rising electoral threat of Reform UK. The RCN, which represents more than 500,000 nurses in the UK and overseas, said the policy would “deny people access to vital support for a decade or more, increase poverty and ultimately drive them away when there are already gaping holes in the workforce”. Ranger, who is also the union’s chief executive, added: “These proposals are no way to treat people who come to the UK to care for patients, become part of our communities and pay tax. “It is pandering of the worst kind, ignorant of the impact on valued migrant staff and their families, but also the patients who need safely staffed services. Yes, ministers need to grow the domestic workforce, but the UK must also be a welcoming, secure place for international nurses.” More than 800 NHS workers criticised the plan on Monday as “harmful, divisive and xenophobic” and warned that the health service would “crumble” without them. The plans have caused concern in several key public services – including the NHS, social care and prisons – which rely heavily on overseas workers. About one in five NHS staff in England are not British, according to official figures . In a letter coordinated by the groups Praxis and Medact, the 800-plus medics said the “already strained NHS would crumble under the pressure” of these proposals, potentially triggering a staff exodus and discouraging overseas medics from working in the UK. A social worker who spoke to the Guardian on condition of anonymity said 25-50% or more of his team would be likely to leave the UK if the government made it harder for them to gain citizenship. “The policy is foolish in terms of the impact it’s going to have on the NHS and [it’s] cruel on all the people it’s going to affect,” he said. The letter says nurses, doctors, dentists and other NHS professionals are “deeply concerned” by Mahmood’s plans to impose “longer and more precarious” routes to settlement. “These extended pathways – often requiring up to 10 years or more of continuous residency – exacerbate instability, making it harder for people to fully participate in society and rebuild their lives,” it said. Praxis, a human rights charity, said 40% of people on the existing 10-year route to settlement were healthcare workers. skip past newsletter promotion Our morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it matters Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

An NHS midwife, who moved to the UK from Nigeria as a child, said she felt “dragged through hell” battling the complex and expensive immigration system and that many would now simply give up. The 26-year-old, who works in a London hospital, said the NHS would “crumble” without foreign-born workers. “I think it’s absolutely ludicrous. I’m not sure how the NHS would survive … The message it says is you’re not welcome here and all the hard work you put in isn’t welcome here.” Government sources have indicated that the tough new measures would not apply to migrants already in the UK. However, it was reported last week that Mahmood was exploring ways to prevent this group from gaining citizenship after five years. Charities have long called for an end to the protracted and expensive route to settlement, with several studies showing that in-work migrant families are far more likely to suffer poverty and destitution as they are excluded from basic welfare support including universal credit, child benefit and disability living allowance. Research from the IPPR thinktank estimates that 1.5 million children in families with migrant parents live in poverty – accounting for more than a third of the total despite making up a fraction of the population. A private briefing to ministers, seen by the Guardian, estimated that between 152,000 and 254,000 children in this cohort were in poverty in 2023, although other research has suggested this is closer to 400,000 children. The proposals, which are due to be consulted on, do not have to be put to a vote before being introduced. A government spokesperson said: “We are grateful to our overseas frontline healthcare workers, who bring compassion, deliver high-quality care and strengthen our health service, but net migration must come down. “As the home secretary has set out, under our proposed new settlement model, individuals will have the opportunity to reduce the 10-year qualifying period to settlement and citizenship based on contributions to the UK economy and society. These plans are subject to a consultation, which we will launch later this year, and we encourage health and care workers to take part.” Quick Guide Contact us about this story Show The best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.

2a33c99b3236,"UK government owes children apology for damaging Covid errors, inquiry hears",,"The government should apologise to children for the damaging mistakes and policy errors it committed during the pandemic, the former children’s commissioner for England has told the Covid-19 inquiry. Giving evidence to the inquiry’s public hearing on Thursday, Anne Longfield said a “doom loop” of fatalism among ministers meant the government failed to do more to help children. She argued that the prolonged lockdowns and school closures were responsible for the explosion in mental health, welfare and behaviour difficulties still being experienced by children and young people. Lady Longfield, who was children’s commissioner at the peak of the pandemic, said the government should issue a formal apology for its “avoidable mistakes” to the children whose lives had been blighted by Covid and its after-effects. “The children and young people who experienced the Covid pandemic – some of whom will now be adults and some of whom are just starting school – are owed a formal apology from the prime minister in parliament once the inquiry has published its final report,” Longfield said. Anne Longfield. Photograph: Gary Calton/The Observer “An apology would give the government an opportunity to formally acknowledge the avoidable mistakes and the damage that was done to many children’s wellbeing, education, health, development, and safety, following decisions that were made by the then government in 2020 and 2021. “It would be a chance to say sorry, and to promise that lessons really will be learned, should there be another pandemic or national emergency in the future.” The Covid-19 public inquiry this week started its investigation focusing on the treatment of children and young people during the pandemic, and will later hear evidence from policymakers and politicians, including Gavin Williamson, who was the education secretary during the period. Longfield said her advice or views were rarely sought by the government during the pandemic, and told the inquiry that the interests of children often “came behind in the queue to pubs, shops, theme parks but also adults, throughout”. Longfield was particularly critical of the government’s decision to drop many elements of social care provision during the pandemic, including diluting requirements for visits to at-risk children. skip past newsletter promotion Our morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it matters Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The lower requirements meant social workers were unable to speak with vulnerable children without their parents present, or to speak with other family members who might have concerns. Longfield said she was frustrated that the government failed to use any inventive thinking around schools and social work that other parts of government, such as the NHS, had employed to solve problems. “There wasn’t the kind of Nightingale moment that hospitals got, in schools. So many things could have been done differently around keeping schools open but they weren’t. “Similarly with social care, [the government] moved straight to an outcome around diluting responsibilities,” she said. Longfield said the after-effects on children and young people were still being felt, citing the doubling in persistent absence from school, the 80% increase in education, health and care plans issued for children with special needs, and a 300% increase in autism among children since before the pandemic. Longfield said the data “is completely conclusive on the increase in virtually every indicator of [increased] vulnerability, from pre-Covid to today”.",https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/oct/02/children-owed-formal-apology-pandemic-damage-covid-inquiry-hears,Society,BBC,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0170f5983e7290c845267325da18947feb6a8aee/411_0_2918_2334/master/2918.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=79608de114795b939ad4eeb25b4aff05",2025-10-02T16:47:45+00:00,de9b16881791536dc3cc3a54f6d09fef7d3677ce
8b60a11c34d5,"Disclosure: Care Home Undercover review – this brilliant, blood-boiling documentary exposes a grim reality",,"O ver the summer, BBC Scotland journalist Catriona MacPhee went undercover, working as a cleaner at the Castlehill Care Home in Inverness. The home – part of Simply Inverness Ltd, itself an offshoot of the company Morar Living – promises a comfortable, even luxurious standard of care for up to 88 residents. When Kerry first looked at the home with her mother, Jessie, she wanted to move in too, she says. But by the time you finish MacPhee’s hour-long film, you will have little doubt that the image Castlehill presents to the outside world – complete with champagne and fine dining – couldn’t be further from the appalling reality. MacPhee meets residents like Teasha, who has dementia and has also used a stoma bag for 35 years. Due to the poor or often absent care at Castlehill, the stoma is now causing her significant discomfort and she is often seen crying out in distress. In one clip, filmed covertly by MacPhee, a member of staff describes Teasha as “mental”. It’s abhorrent, but within the wider context of the neglect and even intimidation endured by those at Castlehill on a daily basis, it is far from surprising. MacPhee finds residents left wearing incontinence pads for more than 12 hours; human excrement on chairs in the lounge; and one woman who hasn’t had a shower in weeks. Castlehill is short-staffed, and even as the regulator begins to ask questions (there’s a surprise visit from the Care Inspectorate in MacPhee’s first week on the job), it’s clear that this place isn’t just mildly inadequate but deeply dysfunctional and dangerous. At one point, Kerry took Jessie home with her; nobody noticed as they left the building. MacPhee’s investigation was triggered by a number of complaints about the home, including one made by Su, who recalls the horrific scenes she herself caught on a hidden camera. She watched in horror as a carer and housekeeper colluded with one another, threatening to hit her father, who has dementia. When Su saw the housekeeper grab her father by the wrist and pin him to his bed, she called the police. Her police complaint would become a social services issue, and when they told the home about the hidden camera, her father was barred from having guests. Su’s father has since left Castlehill; she says that carers were still noting him as being asleep and comfortable in bed on their app when he was no longer living there. Su’s complaint was upheld in full by the Care Inspectorate. In fact, says MacPhee, no other care home in Scotland had as many complaints upheld against it last year as Castlehill. It’s easy to see why: the home is so stretched that when Teasha’s daughter Vanessa visited every day, she found herself more or less taking on the role of a carer. But, beyond being stretched, there’s also the sense that many staff simply don’t care enough. MacPhee’s hidden camera footage shows Teasha in major distress, yet being frequently ignored by staff she knows well. One of MacPhee’s colleagues – her face blurred for obvious reasons – recounts how other colleagues told her that somebody needed to be changed while she was with another resident, instead of doing it themselves. “There’s principles and they don’t have it,” she says, wearily. “It’s common decency.” But is it so common after all? Based on everything we see in the film, there’s often very little concern for the welfare – never mind the quality of life – of the people who live at Castlehill. And while some staff are clearly trying, the general picture is bleak. Linda breaks down when she sees footage of her mother-in-law, Rachel, being forced to receive intimate care from a male staff member, against the wishes stated in her care plan. “They’ve seriously let us down … they’ve let her down,” she says with tears in her eyes. And even when the home does manage to get the basics right, there is little stimulation for many of these people, whom MacPhee encounters sitting in the same position for hours on end. This, in turn, leads to more rapid cognitive decline. The film briefly considers what can be done to improve the sector (such as recruiting more staff), but the truth is that it needs the kind of radical overhaul that would require several hours more airtime to truly dissect. But what it does do – brilliantly, blood-boilingly – is to show us just how grim it can be, and how much money is being made in the process. Teasha’s self-funded place at Castlehill cost £7,033 a month, while Morar Living is expected to make £90m in pre-tax profits over the next five years. While the company didn’t provide a spokesperson for interview, in a statement it said that each resident is consistently monitored and evaluated; that a clinical lead had been appointed; and the number of zero-hours staff had been reduced to zero. It also said it would invest £1m to refurbish Castlehill, and that recent improvements had been noted by the Care Inspectorate. Regardless, I really hope its shareholders were watching.",https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2025/oct/01/disclosure-care-home-undercover-review-this-brilliant-blood-boiling-documentary-exposes-a-grim-reality,Society,BBC,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/54ef77bcab04dbbd52385f997f3da97e4acecb25/342_0_1406_1125/master/1406.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctcmV2aWV3LTQucG5n&enable=upscale&s=478bffc4047e092f11d45e65de82a875",2025-10-01T20:00:28+00:00,7835b6d89d06fd1adb0ead0b639c9d012931c560
f51ea55e639f,Looking for signs of life in centre-right politics in Britain,,"Dating as I do from the second world war, I can assure Zoe Williams that the Tory party started imploding well before Boris Johnson, David Cameron and co ( Enjoying the implosion of the Tories? That’s understandable – but completely wrong, 6 October ). One-nation Tories became extinct the minute Margaret Thatcher took office. The true old-school Conservatives were the Macmillan generation, and they were possibly a one-off. That generation had seen two world wars (Macmillan was wounded in the first), they’d witnessed the great slump of the 1920s and 30s, and consequently they’d had their eyes opened and had to question their often privileged upbringings. They largely continued the Keynesian social democratic policies established by Labour’s Clement Attlee (also public school educated and wounded in the first world war) and this continued until Thatcher established the wrecking ball of Friedmanism, which has now had 45 years to demonstrate its legacy of record inequality, tottering public services and our companies departing abroad in ever increasing numbers. But don’t hold your breath for a change in the party. The English electorate, at least, have always shown a healthy appetite for masochism and being told their place. There may be life in Thatcherism yet. David Redshaw Saltdean, East Sussex Kemi Badenoch says that she will scrap stamp duty on primary residences if elected ( Report, 8 October ). The “party of fiscal responsibility” proposes to create a tax deficit while the country’s debt is running at 100% of GDP and we pay almost as much in debt interest as we do on education. How is this responsible? Does she understand nothing about the factors driving house prices? People’s ability to buy is limited by their ability to borrow, and part of the borrowing needs to cover the cost of paying stamp duty. Cut out the stamp duty and all that will happen is house prices will rise to close the gap. The economic illiteracy of the Tories continues to astound me. Des Senior Aylesbeare, Devon The Conservative leadership now regrets that the size of our civil service has increased in the last nine years. Did it not occur to any of them that leaving the EU would involve adding extra staff in London to handle regulatory issues that had been managed collectively with our partners in the EU, as well as to negotiate the multiple bilateral relationships with our European neighbours that are essential now that we are outside? William Wallace Liberal Democrat, House of Lords While agreeing with Polly Toynbee that a grownup centre‑right party is a necessary evil, I hope she’s not expecting us to look out the nose peg she has previously championed to go out and vote for them ( I didn’t think I’d ever say this: let’s hope the Tory party can be saved, 7 October ). Les Bright Exeter “Britain badly needs a grownup party of the centre right,” says the subheading on Polly Toynbee’s article. Isn’t that what Labour is trying to be?

0a1fd29a49b5,The false economy of reduced public services,,"George Monbiot is correct that cuts in public services cost far more than the money saved ( It hurt when I crashed my bike into a pothole – and it taught me the true price of austerity, 4 October ). I am a trustee of a small charity in Kent, The Social Justice Network , which runs a number of projects, including supporting refugees and their families to settle locally. Recently we welcomed a family of 10 (parents and eight children aged five to 16) from another county. The council had worked hard to house the family in its area but was unable to, despite having accepted its duty to do so. As a result of a forced move of nearly 100 miles at 24 hours’ notice, the father lost his job and is now benefit capped. Removing the two-child limit would make this family only marginally better off as they would still face the family benefit cap. Organisations including the Department for Work and Pensions, Canterbury city council and Kent county council (KCC) worked with us to find schools, healthcare, benefits, food banks and free English classes for the parents, which were essential if they were to find work, settle and contribute to society. However, they were turned down for bus passes by KCC (which said there were no funds for this). The parents had no means of transport to get to the local adult education centre (funded by KCC) nearly three miles from their home. As a result of not attending, they were kicked off the course. The family has since been rehoused, but for three months they were not learning English, not employed, not settled. They are one family among thousands, trapped in poverty and isolation by disjointed policies that are ostensibly about money, but which fail to acknowledge the true cost. Jeremy Cross Canterbury George Monbiot’s excellent article on the actual cost of potholes does not mention one infuriating aspect of the whole sorry business. Road maintenance has been outsourced for decades by council authorities to private contractors on the basis, one assumes, that it looks cheaper on the council’s books. But private contractors appear to have little interest in doing a good, lasting repair. What they want to do is a cosmetic “throw-and-go”, which deteriorates rapidly. This is the basis of their projected income stream – repeat purchase – as it is for any business. It’s no use blaming the contractors, as they are only doing what any business would do when faced with a tender system that always favours the lowest quote. The council, in turn, is similarly trapped in a system where it wants to keep council tax as low as possible and economise wherever possible on the cost of services. There is little interest in undertaking longer-term cost analysis because it might reveal myopic decision-making. Monica Hall Farnborough, Hampshire Politicians pride themselves on their realism, yet they invariably choose the more expensive option over the cheaper one. In this example, doing nothing over doing something, for fear of financial overspend. The same meanness applies to the two-child benefit cap. The spirit of the Dickensian workhouse is alive and kicking in contemporary Britain. The reason is the embedding of neoliberalism in mainstream political thinking. As for Margaret Thatcher , so for Keir Starmer: there is no alternative. A ramshackle Britain is the price worth paying, as low taxes mean the freeing of entrepreneurial talents of the wealthy. That plus the belief in transferring state enterprise to the more capable hands of private management. As a citizen of this country, I have yet to see any of the benefits of neoliberalism materialise. Derrick Joad Leeds George Monbiot’s analysis of the negative financial, as well as physical, effects of potholes highlights the repeated failure of governments to appreciate the economic‑growth benefits of maintaining and improving the country’s transport links.

ac68de96f05a,Foreign Office chief to visit China after collapse of high-profile espionage case,,"The head of the Foreign Office will travel to China next week as ministers come under pressure over the collapse of a high-profile espionage case , the Guardian can disclose. Oliver Robbins, who as permanent secretary of the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO) is its most senior civil servant, will visit China on “long-planned” government business. The trip comes during the same week ministers are expected to face questions over whether they had a hand in the abandonment of charges against two men, including a former parliamentary researcher, accused of spying for Beijing. Christopher Cash and Christopher Berry, who had always maintained their innocence, now have no case to answer. Conservative MPs will seek to haul ministers to parliament to explain the sequence of events that led to the collapse of the trial of Cash and Berry, which had been due to begin this week. Downing Street has said there was no ministerial or official involvement in the case being pulled. But in an extraordinary disclosure Stephen Parkinson, the director of public prosecutions, said prosecutors were forced to drop the case after failing to obtain a witness statement from the government stating that China posed a “threat to the national security of the UK”. Parkinson told MPs in a letter on Tuesday that “efforts were made over many months” to obtain this piece of evidence and that without it the case “could not succeed”, although legal experts have since cast doubt on whether it would have been necessary. The developments have raised questions about the government’s diplomatic rapprochement with Beijing ahead of a crunch decision on whether to approve a proposal for a Chinese super-embassy in east London. Robbins will become the latest senior government figure to travel to Beijing, after recent trips by Peter Kyle, the business secretary, for trade talks in September and Jonathan Powell, the national security adviser, for high-level meetings in July. Keir Starmer is expected to visit China early in the new year. A UK government spokesperson said: “This visit has been long planned as part of the permanent undersecretary’s regular travel to the FCDO’s overseas network of embassies and high commissions. This follows the visit by the previous permanent undersecretary in April 2023.” Robbins is reported to have attended a meeting in Whitehall in early September where Powell set out details of how the government’s evidence would not describe China as an “enemy”. In order to prove the case under the Official Secrets Act, prosecutors would have had to show the defendants were acting for an “enemy”. Parkinson told MPs that the case law had changed in July, after the trial of six Bulgarians accused of spying for Russia , and implied that the enemy requirement had become more stringent. Some legal experts argue that the bar for prosecution has in fact been lowered. Starmer has argued that the case against Cash and Berry rested on the Conservative government’s approach towards China, saying that the alleged offences took place in 2022 and early 2023. “You have to prosecute people on the basis of the circumstances at the time of the alleged offence, and so all the focus needs to be on the policy of the Tory government in place then,” the prime minister told reporters this week. Philip Barton, the last permanent secretary in the Foreign Office, visited Beijing in the spring of 2023 for meetings with senior figures including Liu Jianchao, the head of the Chinese Communist party’s powerful international department. Liu last visited London in June for meetings with MPs and ministers including the then foreign secretary David Lammy, but was reportedly detained by Chinese authorities shortly after his return. He has been replaced in his role by Liu Haixing . Quick Guide Contact us about this story Show The best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.

c79d1fbda0d5,A battlefield hit by HS2 – and planning rules,,"It isn’t just the countryside and its residents that are suffering due to HS2 ( ‘It’s been beyond difficult’: earthworks of HS2 take toll on Chilterns residents, 2 October ). The high-speed rail contractor has recently done considerable damage to potential archaeology on the nationally important registered battlefield at Edgcote, a Wars of the Roses battle fought in 1469. HS2 stripped 30cm of soil from an area equivalent to around 16 football pitches to allow storage of hundreds of thousands of tons of earth dug out along the route of the new railway. The archaeology of battle sits in the topsoil and understanding its distribution is key. HS2’s contractor undertook a geophysical survey prior to work beginning. But this method is not designed to find the types of small artefacts typically found on a medieval battlefield. If it had used a systematic metal-detecting survey instead, such material would not have been lost. This is baffling, because HS2 has an otherwise good track record on archaeological investigation, including on the Edgcote battlefield part of the route. So why has it happened? The real villain of this piece is the current permitted development rules, which allowed HS2’s contractor to press on with work on the battlefield once it had been told by planners that an environmental-impact assessment was not necessary. We think of permitted development allowing house owners to build extensions, but they also let major engineering works to be undertaken outside normal planning scrutiny. This prevents an assessment of the impact of development on heritage and crucially fails to require any archaeological investigations before work begins. The Battlefields Trust does not seek to limit householder extensions or prevent development that preserves or enhances battlefield sites. But permitted development rules need to change if they are to stop damaging our heritage.

2c2526e5cffb,A question of leadership at the Samaritans,,"Thank you for continuing to highlight the concerns about the Samaritans charity ( Samaritans to push on with branch closures despite volunteers’ objections, 1 October ). I am a volunteer in the north-east of England and I and many of our volunteers have felt very unhappy about the proposed changes. It is really rewarding being a Samaritan, but can also be very challenging. Volunteers need a high degree of motivation, and this has inevitably been affected by the proposals. Interestingly, in 2021 our chair, Keith Leslie, published A Question of Leadership, which is about leading organisational change. According to the Amazon description of this publication “60% to 70% of change initiatives fail”, caused by the leader’s “inability to fully consider the consequences and magnitude of the situation”. Also it states that change initiatives often overlook the mental health of those involved. I haven’t read this book, but I really can’t understand how its author could consider continuing as our chair when the leadership has run roughshod over the charity’s very core: the volunteers. I believe that our CEO, Julie Bentley, should also consider her position. I am sure that most volunteers realise that change is inevitable and important. The drastic measures initially proposed do not take into account the dedication, loyalty and hard work that it takes to keep us all going.

fe3a493dfb25,Manchester synagogue attack: charity volunteer among injured,,"One of those injured in Thursday’s attack on a synagogue in Manchester was working for the Community Security Trust (CST), it has emerged, as the organisation was praised for its role in preventing an even worse atrocity. The sight of volunteers in the charity’s hi-vis bibs has become familiar to anyone frequenting Jewish places of worship, schools and other sites in recent years. However, for decades it has also informed public policy by monitoring and combating antisemitism, while also playing a role countering hatred towards other communities. In the two years since the 7 October 2023 attacks in Israel and the start of the war in Gaza, the organisation’s staffing has increased by about a third against the backdrop of a rise in antisemitic offences. There were 3,282 religious hate crimes targeted at Jewish people in the year to March 2024, up from 1,543 in the previous year, according to Home Office figures. Separate data from the CST itself, based on the number of antisemitic incidents that have been reported to the charity, recorded 1,521 antisemitic incidents across the UK in the first half of this year. Graph shows average number of hate crimes recorded per 10,000 people, categorised by the perceived religion of the victim. While it became a charity in 1994, the CST and its predecessors have recorded and published antisemitic incident figures in the UK since 1984. Today, its work revolves around more than 100 members of staff and 2,000 dedicated volunteers who undergo intensive training in everything from first aid to carrying out security. While its volunteers have been hurt in the past, the severe injuries to one of its personnel in Manchester is believed to be the most serious yet. “We pray for his continuing recovery and salute the courage of all those who helped stop the terrorist from getting into the shul [synagogue],” said the CST’s chief executive, Mark Gardner. The CST presence at sites is often a mixture of its own volunteers, including trained congregants, as well as private security guards. As a recipient of funding from the Home Office, the CST distributes an £18m government grant that pays for commercial security guards. These were deployed last year at sites including 200 nurseries, 260 synagogues and 50 high-profile communal buildings. The CST itself relies on donations. Less visible is the CST’s wider work in training, advising on security and its long-standing research into antisemitism from sources including neo-Nazis and radical Islamists. Its work in this sphere has contributed to cases including the jailing in 2021 of a man who was then one of the UK’s most prolific far-right antisemitic video streamers. Counter-terrorism police were alerted to his activity by the CST. The charity also works closely with partners including Tell Mama – the national project that records and measures anti-Muslim incidents in the UK, and which has described the CST’s work as “groundbreaking”. Both are in a formal partnership with other anti-hate organisations as part of the Community Alliance to Combat Hate (CATCH) partnership. CST’s work, which other communities have drawn on, also includes its guide for security procedures for places of worship . In other areas, it runs tailored youth street awareness courses for teenagers in conjunction with Maccabi GB, the sports, health and wellbeing charity, under the Streetwise programme Other work includes partnerships with the police and with MPs, while it meets regularly with ministers and feeds into government policy on antisemitism.

7693ed382efc,"Tories would scrap stamp duty on primary residences, Kemi Badenoch tells conference",,"The Conservatives would scrap stamp duty on sales of primary residences if they won the next election, Kemi Badenoch has said, in a policy-heavy speech designed to improve her standing as Tory leader and her party’s economic credibility with voters. Badenoch told her party’s conference she would abolish the tax that new buyers in England and Northern Ireland have to pay on house purchases over £125,000, at an estimated cost of £9bn a year. Stamp duty would still apply to additional properties bought by companies, and for purchases by non-UK residents. She made the promise at the end of a four-day conference in Manchester during which she has bolstered her precarious position at the top of her party with two assured speeches and no direct challenge from her clearest rival, Robert Jenrick. “Home ownership should be a dream that’s open to everyone,” she told the conference. “Abolishing stamp duty on your home is a key to unlock a fairer and more aspirational society. Scrapping stamp duty will benefit people of all ages, because conservatism must speak to all generations: the young professional buying their first flat, the couple looking for somewhere to bring up their first baby, the growing family hunting for their forever home.” In an attempt to answer questions about her vision for Britain, she said: “I stand for stronger borders and a stronger economy – so that the young can fulfil their potential, the old can live out their years in dignity, and everyone can achieve their dreams to own a home, run a business, raise a family.” Many economists are highly critical of stamp duty, which they say slows the housing market and discourages people in smaller families from moving out of larger homes and freeing up space for others. Rachel Reeves, the chancellor, has been considering replacing the tax with another form of property tax, though sources say she is unlikely to do so in this year’s budget. Badenoch said it should be abolished entirely, however, as a way to stimulate the housing market and the broader economy. She said the policy was affordable because of a separate promise to make nearly £50bn in spending cuts by 2029. Though economists say the promised spending cuts are vague and difficult to assess, the Conservative leader said they would generate enough to allow tax cuts and deficit reduction after the next election. The pledge came at the end of a Tory conference littered with policy announcements , including promises to leave the European convention on human rights, to repeal the Climate Change Act and to slash welfare payments. The slew of proposals contrasts with Badenoch’s insistence earlier this year that the party would not set out its policy stall until 2027. An aide explained that the change in strategy had come during the summer, when Badenoch met a voter on the doorstep who told her he did not know what the party stood for. “When she was knocking on the door in July 2024, she spoke to an older gentleman in her constituency who said: ‘I used to know what it meant when you wore a blue rosette.’ “Over the last 14 years, people lost an idea of what the Conservative party stands for … What you have seen from this conference is this is what Kemi Badenoch’s Conservative party stands for.” While Badenoch put a major tax cut at the heart of her speech, she said she would not promise others without first cutting the deficit. skip past newsletter promotion Our morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it matters Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Despite the fact her party now trails Nigel Farage’s party by about 10 points in the poll, she rarely mentioned him by name. In one oblique reference, she appeared to encourage her party not to engage with the Reform leader. “As George Bernard Shaw said: ‘Never wrestle with a pig. You both get dirty and the pig likes it.’”",https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/oct/08/tories-scrap-stamp-duty-kemi-badenoch-conservative-conference-speech,Society,BBC,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/141ef4330bb228cb6f9736ab1bbd70645ed3acc6/438_303_2068_1654/master/2068.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=cbcc0872409c4f48457716ff5d6d0da1",2025-10-08T11:29:38+00:00,5ed798b2e440187d9ca633bc769fe8169d0eb10b

90a710dfead1,Rachel Reeves clears planning blockage amid ‘good relationship’ with developer,,"Rachel Reeves unblocked a development of 20,000 homes that were being held up by a rare snail, after being approached by a developer with whom she said, “we have a good relationship”. The government has been working on planning reforms that nature experts say put wildlife at risk. The reforms could include discarding the EU-derived habitats regulations that protect rare animals, and adding more pro-building amendments to the planning and infrastructure bill, which is going through parliament. In a video, seen by the Guardian, the chancellor says she managed to unblock the Sussex homes that were held up due to what Reeves described as a “microscopic snail”. Speaking on Tuesday to a group of tech company executives at the JP Morgan Tech Stars conference, she said: “We knew about that issue because we’ve got a good relationship with the developer and he brought it to our attention. I didn’t just use it as an example of how bad things were but set about fixing it.” Reeves asked the audience “please don’t tell anyone before Thursday or Friday” as that is when the government plans to announce the development. She described the planning blockage as being due to “some snails on the site that are a protected species or something”, adding: “They are microscopic snails that you cannot even see, and they haven’t been able to build there.” The chancellor appeared to be referring to the little whirlpool ramshorn snail, which is 5mm in diameter, and one of the rarest creatures in Britain. It is an indicator of clean rivers and ponds as it is very sensitive to sewage pollution. skip past newsletter promotion The planet's most important stories.

Air for example, being one of them. “Thousands of jobs in the UK, and in our planning system, are designed to balance the competing needs of developers and the wider public, who rely on nature, biodiversity and breathable air, to have a meaningful existence.” A Treasury spokesperson said the recording was from a private event, adding: “This government is reforming the outdated planning system that’s been holding this country back – so we can build the 1.5m homes and infrastructure that hardworking people need.”",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/oct/07/rachel-reeves-clears-planning-blockage-amid-good-relationship-with-developer,Society,BBC,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1cfa20ef8ac0fe2e229ef8763b898d7c4e7d7fa0/0_209_4526_3621/master/4526.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=52cde3fc8fd5a389492fe72c85571820",2025-10-07T16:15:15+00:00,ef3230b5d7f59620d105717e55c8510c9f6db083
