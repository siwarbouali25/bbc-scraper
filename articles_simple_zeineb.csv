ec3d3fa73daf,EVs take a backseat in Stellantis’ $13B US investment plan,,"Stellantis, the international automaker that owns Chrysler, Jeep, and Ram, said it will invest $13 billion to beef up its U.S. manufacturing over the next four years as part of a broader revival plan directed by its new CEO. Five new vehicles will be developed and produced through 2029 as part of the investment into factories in Illinois, Ohio, Michigan, and Indiana. The investment will also support the production of a new four-cylinder engine and reopen the Belvidere Assembly Plant in Illinois, which will allow the automaker to expand production of the Jeep Cherokee and Jeep Compass for the U.S. market. In all, more than 5,000 jobs will be created. Unlike previous multibillion-dollar investment pledges, however, this one doesn’t focus on electrification. One of the five new vehicles will be a range-extended EV — a vehicle that combines a battery with a gas generator for additional range — produced at the Warren Truck Assembly Plant in Michigan beginning in 2028. The automaker also plans to produce a large, new, gas-powered SUV at the Warren plant. The remaining products include a next-generation Dodge Durango that will be produced at the Detroit Assembly Complex in 2029, a new midsize truck that will be assembled at its Toledo Assembly Complex in Ohio, and an all-new four-cylinder engine called the GMET4 EVO that will go into production beginning in 2026 at its Kokomo, Indiana, factory. Image Credits: Stellantis Stellantis CEO and North America COO Antonio Filosa said the investment will drive the automaker’s growth, strengthen its manufacturing footprint, and “bring more American jobs to the states we call home.” “Accelerating growth in the U.S. has been a top priority since my first day. Success in America is not just good for Stellantis in the U.S. — it makes us stronger everywhere,” Filosa said in a statement. Techcrunch event San Francisco | October 27-29, 2025 Stellantis has scaled back its electrification plans for the U.S. market in the past year. The automaker said in September it would no longer include an electrified Gladiator in its Jeep lineup as it reassessed its product strategy. Earlier that month, the automaker said it canceled plans to produce a battery-electric full-size pickup. However, Stellantis said it still planned to produce an extended-range Ram 1500 REV, formerly called the Ramcharger.",https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/14/evs-take-a-backseat-in-stellantis-13b-u-s-investment-plan,Technology,BBC,Kirsten Korosec,"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Jeep-Gladiator-2024-factory.jpg?resize=1200,853",2025-10-14T22:36:36+00:00,a05687b9215cf705968f587df433a306947cc8ea
5fe3ca322fc9,Sam Altman says ChatGPT will soon allow erotica for adult users,,"OpenAI CEO Sam Altman announced in a post on X Tuesday the company will soon relax some of ChatGPT’s safety restrictions, allowing users to make the chatbot’s responses friendlier or more “human-like,” and for “verified adults” to engage in erotic conversations. “We made ChatGPT pretty restrictive to make sure we were being careful with mental health issues. We realize this made it less useful/enjoyable to many users who had no mental health problems, but given the seriousness of the issue we wanted to get this right,” said Altman. “In December, as we roll out age-gating more fully and as part of our ‘treat adult users like adults’ principle, we will allow even more, like erotica for verified adults.” The announcement is a notable pivot from OpenAI’s months-long effort to address the concerning relationships that some mentally unstable users have developed with ChatGPT. Altman seems to declare an early victory over these problems, claiming OpenAI has “been able to mitigate the serious mental health issues” around ChatGPT. However, the company has provided little to no evidence for this, and is now plowing ahead with plans for ChatGPT to engage in sexual chats with users. Several concerning stories emerged this summer around ChatGPT, specifically its GPT-4o model, suggesting the AI chatbot could lead vulnerable users down delusional rabbit holes. In one case, ChatGPT seemed to convince a man he was a math genius who needed to save the world. In another, the parents of a teenager sued OpenAI , alleging ChatGPT encouraged their son’s suicidal ideations in the weeks leading up to his death. In response, OpenAI released a series of safety features to address AI sycophancy: the tendency for an AI chatbot to hook users by agreeing with whatever they say, even negative behaviors. OpenAI launched GPT-5 in August, a new AI model that exhibits lower rates of sycophancy and features a router that can identify concerning user behavior. A month later, OpenAI launched safety features for minors, including an age prediction system and a way for parents to control their teen’s ChatGPT account. OpenAI announced Tuesday the formation of an expert council of mental health professionals to advise the company on well-being and AI. Just a few months after these concerning stories emerged, OpenAI seems to think ChatGPT’s problems around vulnerable users are under control. It’s unclear whether users are still falling down delusional rabbit holes with GPT-5. And while GPT-4o is no longer the default in ChatGPT, the AI model is still available today and being used by thousands of people. Techcrunch event San Francisco | October 27-29, 2025 The introduction of erotica in ChatGPT is unchartered territory for OpenAI and raises broader concerns around how vulnerable users will interact with the new features. While Altman insists OpenAI isn’t “usage-maxxing” or optimizing for engagement, making ChatGPT more erotic could certainly draw users in. Allowing chatbots to engage in romantic or erotic role play has been an effective engagement strategy for other AI chatbot providers, such as Character.AI. The company has gained tens of millions of users, many of whom use its chatbots at a high rate. Character.AI said in 2023 that users spent an average of two hours a day talking to its chatbots. The company is also facing a lawsuit around how it handles vulnerable users. OpenAI is under pressure to grow its user base. While ChatGPT is already used by 800 million weekly active users, OpenAI is racing against Google and Meta to build mass-adopted AI-powered consumer products. The company has also raised billions of dollars for a historic infrastructure buildout, an investment OpenAI eventually needs to pay back. While adults are surely having romantic relationships with AI chatbots , it’s also quite popular for minors. A new report from the Center for Democracy and Technology found that 19% of high school students have either had a romantic relationship with an AI chatbot, or know a friend who has. Altman says OpenAI will soon allow erotica for “verified adults.” An OpenAI spokesperson tells TechCrunch the company will rely on the age-prediction system it’s building to ensure that ChatGPT’s erotic features are only available to adult users. As Altman previously wrote in a blog post, if OpenAI’s age-prediction system incorrectly marks an adult as a minor, ChatGPT users may have to upload a picture of their government-issued ID into ChatGPT to correct it. Altman writes that, though this is a privacy compromise, the company believes it’s a “worthy tradeoff.” It is unclear whether OpenAI will extend erotica to its AI voice, image, and video generation tools. Altman claims that OpenAI is also making ChatGPT friendlier and erotic because of the company’s “treat adult users like adults” principle. Over the last year, OpenAI has shifted towards a more lenient content moderation strategy for ChatGPT, allowing the chatbot to be more permissive and offer less refusals. In February, OpenAI pledged to represent more political viewpoints in ChatGPT, and in March, the company updated ChatGPT to allow AI-generated images of hate symbols . These policies seem to be an attempt to make ChatGPT’s response more popular with a wide variety of users. However, vulnerable ChatGPT users may benefit from safeguards that limit what a chatbot can engage with. As OpenAI races towards a billion weekly active users, the tension between growth and protecting vulnerable users may only grow.

ecec8cd41e17,"At Starbase, SpaceX is taking firefighting into its own hands",,"SpaceX is quietly standing up a volunteer fire department to serve the sprawling launch-and-manufacturing Starbase complex, tightening its control over emergency response at a site known for rapid — and sometimes explosive — rocket development. A certificate of formation filed with the Texas Secretary of State on June 30 shows the creation of what’s called the Starbase Volunteer Fire Department. The nonprofit entity lists its headquarters as 1 Rocket Road in Brownsville, the principal address of SpaceX. Two of the three directors named on the filing are SpaceX employees: Cody Dye, environmental health and safety manager, and Kevin Bagnall, in-house counsel. The certificate is signed by another SpaceX lawyer, Stephen Herndon. The filing says the organization will “aid, promote and provide for the establishment of systems and facilities for the provision of public safety education, and fire prevention and suppression services.” Another new document posted by the city of Starbase late Tuesday confirms the new volunteer fire department was started by SpaceX employees, and that the new municipality plans to sign a contract with it to “provide Fire Protection Services for all persons and property within the city limits.” That agreement will last for three years before it needs to be renewed. SpaceX has historically handled fires at Starbase, which was recently incorporated as its own Texas city, with a combination of an internal firefighting and emergency response team and help from local fire departments, such as the one in nearby Brownsville. It’s unclear what impact the new volunteer fire department will have on those external relationships, and when asked, Cameron County directed TechCrunch to submit a public information act request. At the time of publication, Cameron County had not responded to that request. SpaceX, Brownsville Fire Department, and Starbase city officials did not respond to TechCrunch’s request for comment. Techcrunch event San Francisco | October 27-29, 2025 It’s also unclear whether the Starbase Volunteer Fire Department is connected to the county’s 911-dispatch system. As it is a volunteer fire department, it is not regulated by the Texas Commission on Fire Protection, which is only authorized to regulate local government fire departments, agency chief Mike Wisko said. The new volunteer fire department was established just months after Starbase became an officially incorporated city in Texas. That has led SpaceX and Starbase city officials — most of whom are current or former SpaceX employees — to exercise more authority over the corner of Texas they occupy. The company town announced in September a deal with Cameron County to take partial control of the beach near the launch complex. Starbase installed gates in June to control public access to the city . The formation of the new volunteer fire department coincided with the end of a separate arrangement: SpaceX’s funding of an emergency fire marshal position inside Cameron County. During an August 26 commissioners meeting, officials acknowledged SpaceX had been funding a fire marshal within the county’s emergency-management office. “There was a position that was being funded through an agreement for services with SpaceX. That contract … is terminating,” deputy county administrator Xavier Villarreal told commissioners. He said the county was in the process to continue funding the fire marshal position with a new partner, liquid natural gas developer NextDecade. The duties of a fire marshal include reviewing plans and inspecting buildings for fire-safety compliance. SpaceX may have funded the position, which Villareal acknowledged was “for inspections” and permits, in order to ensure the county could keep up with the increased workload as construction surged. Villarreal did not respond to emailed requests for comment. Starbase is now handling fire-code oversight. The city has appointed two people from the same fire plan review and building inspection vendor, SAFEbuilt, for the task. Cliff Nevins has been appointed as fire marshal and Wade Cain is a building official. Taken together, the new volunteer fire department and the two SAFEbuilt appointments suggest Starbase has internalized fire-code approvals, using a vendor it appoints while shifting emergency response to a company-affiliated organization. This differs from how the new city of Starbase is handling law enforcement. The company town has arranged a deal with Cameron County where two sheriffs will patrol Starbase per shift. Starbase also has access to the county’s jails for a cost of $100 per inmate per day. And in the document posted Tuesday, the city of Starbase agrees to seek other vendors for emergency medical services and arson investigation. The differing approach has turned at least one local head. In response to Starbase terminating the fire marshal funding agreement at the August meeting, one commissioner responded, “But they can’t hire police officers? Interesting.” Starbase’s proposed budget for fiscal year 2026 sets aside just $60,000 for the volunteer fire department, a modest sum compared to the $1.3 million allocated to the law enforcement contracts with the county. The disparity suggests that SpaceX itself may be footing much of the bill for equipment and other expenses. The shift comes as SpaceX continues to expand its launch operations at Starbase. SpaceX’s rapid-prototyping approach to development has led to a number of fires and explosions at the facility. In June, following a test firing of the company’s Super Heavy booster, a malfunction triggered a dramatic fireball that was visible for miles and caused panicked nearby residents to flood local dispatch with calls. No injuries were reported.

40bc40557ea5,Inaudible sound might be the next frontier in wildfire defense,,"A decade ago, two college students built a fire extinguisher that snuffed out a fire using nothing more than a booming 10-inch subwoofer. The internet lapped it up, and Jimmy Fallon even booked a demonstration for “The Tonight Show.” But since that brief viral moment, there hasn’t been much more than a whisper about the technology. It’s not for lack of trying. The college kids weren’t the first to prove the concept. DARPA was on the case in 2012 ; and a search of the scientific literature reveals dozens of researchers investigating the idea. One startup now claims to have cracked the problem. Sonic Fire Tech has built an acoustic fire suppression system that doesn’t just extinguish flames, it might also protect homes and other buildings from wildfires. The startup has raised a $3.5 million seed round from investors, including Khosla Ventures and Third Sphere, TechCrunch has exclusively learned. Wildfires cost the U.S. as much as $424 billion annually . The problem has become so acute in places like California that insurers are refusing to renew policies after repeated blazes have reduced large swathes of the state to ashes. Sonic Fire Tech has been developing its technology over the last several years. Michael Thomas, who is chairman of the startup’s board, had been tinkering with the idea of using sound to fight fires, and when he hit a wall, he reached out to Geoff Bruder over LinkedIn. Bruder had worked for NASA, where he focused on heat and acoustics. “This is kind of a new-age founding story,” Bruder, the startup’s CEO and CTO, told TechCrunch. Techcrunch event San Francisco | October 27-29, 2025 Bruder was intrigued with Thomas’ idea and set about building a prototype. “I got a subwoofer and some parts from Home Depot and AutoZone and said, ‘Hey, let’s see if we can do any better than other people had,’” Bruder recalled. “We knocked a fire out from seven feet in my driveway.” VIDEO The startup soon ditched the subwoofer and moved to lower frequencies. The problem with audible frequencies is that any system powerful enough to suppress a fire would be damaging to people’s hearing, Bruder said. “You’ve basically got to throw a speaker design in the trash and start from scratch,” he said. There are competing theories as to how exactly acoustic energy can disrupt combustion, but the soundless demonstrations certainly suggest that Sonic Fire Tech is onto something. The new system uses a reciprocating piston much like those inside a car’s engine, but it is significantly larger. An electric motor turns a crankshaft, which pulses the two-foot piston to produce infrasound, the technical term for sound that’s below people’s hearing range, or about 20 Hz. “Since we designed everything ourselves, we dropped the frequency to where we’re below audible range, which helps us transmit further, and it makes it safe,” Bruder said. Sonic Fire Tech’s current record is 25 feet. A bigger system could work as far away as 330 feet, Bruder said. The company plans to sell and install its system for about 2% of a home’s value, and it’s talking with insurance companies to qualify the technology. To protect a house, Sonic Fire Tech routes infrasound from a single generator through rigid ducts that sit on the roof’s ridge and under the eaves. On the ridge, they fire down the pitch to catch any fires that might start in debris in the gutters. Under the eaves, they are aimed toward the ground to suppress any flames that pop up near the walls. The system turns on when sensors detect a flame. A home-based system draws around 500 watts of electricity, and in case of a power outage, Sonic Fire Tech is drawing up plans to use lead-acid batteries for backup. Unlike sprinkler systems, it doesn’t require a source of water, which can be in short supply in wildfire country. The startup is working with PG&E and Southern California Edison to demonstrate the technology on homes, and it has signed a letter of intent with a chemical storage facility. “The natural progression is, if we get certified as a sprinkler replacement, then you can just run a pipe into your house and protect your kitchen and everywhere you would need to protect,” Bruder said.",https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/14/inaudible-sound-might-be-the-next-frontier-in-wildfire-defense,Technology,BBC,Tim De Chant,"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/GettyImages-2192375010.jpg?resize=1200,800",2025-10-14T19:54:34+00:00,d34a91c4c403ffdcaecfd19fa06cb0a3646af979
d472be5e94bb,Spotify partners with Netflix for video podcast distribution deal,,"Spotify is bringing its video podcasts to Netflix starting next year, the company announced on Tuesday. Amid the company’s push to further expand its video content selection and boost its ads business, Spotify has announced a partnership with Netflix that will showcase select video podcasts on the popular streaming service. At launch, the Netflix-Spotify partnership will bring a curated selection of sports, culture, lifestyle, and true crime podcasts from Spotify Studios and The Ringer to Netflix. Over time, the deal will see Spotify adding even more podcasts from other studios and genres, Spotify said. The move follows Spotify’s increased focus on video podcasts, beginning with the launch of tools that made it possible for anyone to publish their shows as videos . Over the past year, the company has added incentives that paid podcaster hosts for their popular videos and launched a Partner Program so hosts could monetize their video content, in a challenge to YouTube. Spotify has also recently rolled out a number of social tools that let hosts engage their audiences, including polls, Q&As , comments , and more. Spotify’s interest in streaming video comes after a major shift in its podcast strategy back in 2023, which included layoffs , including that of chief content and business officer Dawn Ostroff, who had led its podcast initiatives. During Ostroff’s time at the service, Spotify had invested billions in podcasts, buying studios like Parcast , The Ringer, and Gimlet Media, and signing exclusive podcast deals with big names like Joe Rogan and Alex Cooper , which have since expired. However, Spotify’s investments failed to turn into substantial profits, necessitating a new strategy. Video, which is heavily consumed by Gen Z users in particular, offers more opportunities for ad products and monetization, the company now believes. As of Q2 2025 , the company said it now has more than 430,000 video podcasts on its service, and video consumption is growing 20x faster than audio-only consumption since 2024. More than 350 million Spotify users have also streamed a video on its platform, up 65% year-over-year. Reached for comment, Spotify declined to share the details of its deal with Netflix, in terms of ad-sharing or monetization. Techcrunch event San Francisco | October 27-29, 2025 Initially, Spotify’s video podcasts will be made available to users in the U.S. starting in early 2026. Other global markets will follow. “This partnership marks a new chapter for podcasting,” said Spotify VP and Head of Podcasts Roman Wasenmüller, in an announcement. “Together with Netflix, we’re expanding discovery, helping creators reach new audiences and giving fans around the world the chance to experience the stories they love and uncover favorites they never expected. This offers more choice to creators and unlocks a completely new distribution opportunity,” he added. Spotify’s stock declined after its last earnings release in July as the company’s ad-supported revenues dropped despite a growing user and subscriber base. The company told investors at the time that it still believed in its overall strategy and its ability to turn around its programmatic ad business. The following Spotify shows are included in the distribution partnership: The Bill Simmons Podcast The Zach Lowe Show The McShay Show Fairway Rollin’ The Mismatch The Ringer F1 Show The Ringer Fantasy Football Show The Ringer NFL Show The Ringer NBA Show The Rewatchables The Big Picture The Dave Chang Show The Recipe Club Dissect Conspiracy Theories Serial Killers",https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/14/spotifys-video-podcasts-are-coming-to-netflix-next-year,Technology,BBC,Sarah Perez,"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/spotify-app-GettyImages-1689920063-e1702479483636.jpeg?resize=1200,676",2025-10-14T18:00:00+00:00,31d527b8dd48664de7511b75abd43ed4bfc7858e
d1ab33196b0a,Impulse Space details plan to deliver up to 6 tons a year to the moon,,"Impulse Space laid out an ambitious plan Tuesday to use its tech to haul tons of cargo to the moon as early as 2028, aiming to fill what it sees as a gap in today’s market for mid-sized surface deliveries. The company says it will pair a new lunar lander with its “Helios” high-energy kick stage to move tons to the surface without needing to refuel on orbit. The aim is to deliver up to 6 tons of payload to the moon across two missions “at a cost-effective price point.” The startup, founded by former SpaceX propulsion chief Tom Mueller , argues this capacity would fill a “critical gap” in lunar payload logistics for cargo too big to fit on landers part of NASA’s Commercial Lunar Payload Services program and too small for the forthcoming human-rated landers that are being developed by SpaceX and Blue Origin. Impulse says payloads that hit this mark are roughly 0.5 to 13 tons, a range that could include rovers, habitat modules, power generators, comms systems, or even a lunar terrain vehicle. Under the proposed architecture, the lander and kick stage would launch on a standard rocket where they would be deployed in low Earth orbit. Helios would transport the lander to low lunar orbit within seven days, after which the two vehicles would separate, and the lander would descend to the surface. Impulse is bringing to the table deep expertise in spacecraft engine development; it is already at work on the lunar lander engine, which uses the same fuel combination as the Saiph thrusters used on the company’s small spacecraft Mira. Meanwhile, Helios is “already well into development,” with the first flight scheduled for late 2026. The company estimates it will be flying Helios multiple times per year by 2028. Techcrunch event San Francisco | October 27-29, 2025 Execution risks remain. As the company points out, a lunar lander engine needs to be throttleable, able to restart, and with a high specific impulse to provide ultra-control in the vacuum of space. Impulse seemed to be hedging its bets in a press release, saying, “we stand ready to execute as dictated by industry demand and interest.” But if the company can deliver, it would open up an entirely new lunar delivery schedule.",https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/14/impulse-space-details-plan-to-deliver-up-to-6-tons-a-year-to-the-moon,Technology,BBC,Aria Alamalhodaei,"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/unnamed-1.png?resize=1200,675",2025-10-14T17:53:47+00:00,730e8af5e4d3b27e43083f63b2f9fb02452bc64d
ce961e7c1716,Mozilla’s Firefox adds Perplexity’s AI answer engine as a new search option,,"While AI companies , startups , and others are rolling out their own web browsers that embed AI services deep into the web surfing experience, Mozilla’s Firefox is instead allowing its customers to swap out their default search engine for an AI-powered search option in the browser they already use. The company on Tuesday announced that it’s bringing AI answer engine Perplexity to Firefox, letting customers decide whether they want to use AI to search the web and find new information. Mozilla had previously announced it was testing the integration, but the option was only available in select markets, including the U.S., U.K., and Germany. It was not yet determined if Perplexity would become a permanent addition to Firefox’s list of web search providers, alongside others like Google, Bing, and DuckDuckGo. Image Credits: Mozilla Now, the company says that positive user feedback has pushed it to make Perplexity available to its global users on the desktop. It will arrive on mobile devices in the months ahead. Once enabled, Perplexity offers a conversational search experience where answers appear with citations, as opposed to a list of web links, as with Google’s traditional search. The option will appear in the unified search button in the address bar, which lets you quickly switch to search with Perplexity as needed. Users can also configure their default search provider in Firefox’s settings. Mozilla had earlier said that if the Perplexity pilot was successful, it would look to add more AI answer engines or search options to its browser in the future. (It likely started with Perplexity because the company says it won’t share or sell users’ personal data.) Alongside news of the AI search option, Mozilla also noted it’s making its browser profiles broadly available to all users after months of tests and a gradual rollout. This feature lets you switch between different browser setups, like those for work, school, or personal use.

32fc578dba0b,Facebook brings back job listings in the US,,"Three years after removing its job listings feature, Facebook is bringing it back to users in the U.S., focusing on helping people find local jobs in entry-level, trade, and service sectors. Job listings, available to all users 18 years and older, can be found in a tab within the Marketplace section as well as in Groups and Pages. Users can filter and sort jobs by category, distance, and job type. Facebook also says it will provide tailored recommendations for relevant opportunities based on users’ job browsing history. After submitting their applications, they can chat with companies via Messenger to arrange interviews. Image Credits: Facebook The job listings feature initially launched in 2017 in the U.S. and Canada, and then expanded to over 40 countries a year later. However, in 2022, Facebook limited its support to only the U.S. and Canada, ultimately discontinuing the feature in 2023, likely due to the increasing use of LinkedIn. Meta didn’t explain why it chose to bring back job listings now. However, it seems like it’s trying to go back to its roots and expand its purpose beyond just social networking. Back in January, Meta’s CEO Mark Zuckerberg mentioned wanting to see a “return to OG Facebook” as one of his big goals this year during the Q4 earnings call. This could also be a way for Facebook to appeal to younger people who are just starting out in their careers and to draw in more Gen Z users. Plus, by prioritizing entry-level, trade, and service industry positions, Facebook aims to differentiate itself from LinkedIn, which tends to cater to medium- and high-skilled job roles.

eb04ab886a13,Google’s Gemini can now help you schedule Google Calendar meetings,,"Google is launching a new tool that uses AI to make it easier for Gmail users with Google Calendar to schedule their meetings. On Tuesday, the company launched a Gemini-powered “Help me schedule” feature that will surface ideal meeting times based on calendar availability and then display them to the person you’re emailing to set up a meeting. The company notes that the feature is designed to work for one-on-one meetings, not those with multiple contacts or group meetings. The launch of the new feature comes amid a flurry of Google Workspace announcements that focus on infusing AI more deeply into users’ everyday tools. This includes the introduction of Google’s latest image editing model, Nano Banana, and Gemini features in Google Slides; tools to share custom AI assistants called Gems with other team members; new formats in NotebookLM; improved AI video tools in Google Vids; and more. Image Credits: Google To use the meeting scheduling option, you’ll click the new “Help me schedule” button that appears below your email compose screen in Gmail. This will display a series of timeslots where you have open availability. You can click an edit button to change or remove some of the options, then insert them into your email and send it to the recipient as usual. When the recipient picks a time that works for them, the calendar invite automatically appears on both people’s calendars. While there are several meeting assistants and automated scheduling tools already on the market, like those from Calendly, Doodle, Zoom, HubSpot, and others, Google notes that its tool uses Gemini’s AI to use the email’s context when it makes its meeting suggestions. For instance, if someone writes in the email that they’d like to book a 30-minute time slot next, then the meeting assistant will only suggest half-hour slots before the end of next week that fit your schedule. Google previously offered an appointment scheduling feature in Google Calendar , but it wasn’t integrated with Gmail, nor did it use AI.

The new capability will help Google Meet compete with other video-conferencing apps that already have virtual makeup features, including Microsoft Teams and Zoom. Google Meet offers 12 different makeup options to choose from, which can be found in the “Appearance” section under “Portrait touch-up,” which is a feature that has been available since 2023 to provide users with options like complexion smoothing, under-eye lightening, and eye whitening. Image Credits: Google Meet Notably, Google says that the virtual makeup will stay in place no matter how the user moves on-screen, making it seem more authentic. So, if a user takes a sip of coffee, the filter will stay on their face instead of shifting to the mug. Additionally, the feature will be disabled by default and can be activated by the user either before or during a video call. Once a makeup style is applied, Google Meet will remember your choices for future meetings.

103229bba6e6,Coco Robotics taps UCLA professor to lead new physical AI research lab,,"Coco Robotics , a startup known for its fleet of last-mile delivery bots, is looking to get more information out of the five years’ worth of data its robots have collected. Its answer: a physical AI lab with University of California Los Angeles (UCLA) professor Bolei Zhou at the helm. Coco Robotics, which made the announcement Tuesday, said Zhou has also joined the Los Angeles-based startup as chief AI scientist. When the company launched in 2020, it used teleoperators to help the bots navigate obstacles on their delivery routes. Coco Robotics co-founder and CEO Zach Rash told TechCrunch the company’s goal has always been to operate its last-mile delivery robots autonomously to cut the overall costs of delivery. Now, Rash said the company has collected enough data to dive deeper into automation. “We have millions of miles of data collected in the most complicated urban settings possible, and that data is incredibly important for training any sort of useful and reliable real-world AI systems,” Rash said. “We’re now at the point where we have sufficient data scale where I think we can start really accelerating a lot of the research happening around physical AI.” The decision to tap Zhou to lead the effort was a “no brainer,” Rash said. Zhou’s research around computer vision and robotics has largely focused on micromobility, as opposed to full-scale vehicles, Rash said. Coco Robotics was already collaborating with Zhou, too. Both Rash and his co-founder Brad Squicciarini are UCLA alums and have even donated one of their bots to the school’s research lab. “[Zhou] is one of the leading researchers in the whole world on robot navigation, reinforcement learning, and a lot of the technologies and areas of research that are highly relevant for us,” Rash said. “He’s been already very capable of recruiting some of the top researchers in the world who he’s worked with in the past to come join Coco and help accelerate things on our end.” Techcrunch event San Francisco | October 27-29, 2025 This new research lab is separate from the collaboration the robotics startup has with OpenAI , which allows Coco Robotics to use OpenAI’s models while the AI research lab gets access to the company’s robot-collected data. Coco Robotics plans to use the information and research it gathers from the lab for its own purposes for now. Rash said the company doesn’t have plans to sell the data to its peers. Rather, it will be used for the company to improve its automation and efficiency, which will mainly pertain to the local models its robots run on. Rash said they also plan to share their research findings with the cities they operate in when applicable, to help fix obstacles and infrastructure that slows their bots down. “Success for this lab really looks at us offering a higher-quality service at an extremely low price,” Rash said. “How do we get our costs lower? How do we make this much more affordable for businesses and customers? I think that’s going to create a tremendous amount of growth in this ecosystem.”",https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/14/coco-robotics-taps-ucla-professor-to-lead-new-physical-ai-research-lab,Technology,BBC,Rebecca Szkutak,"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Coco-Robotics-image.jpg?resize=1200,960",2025-10-14T15:51:10+00:00,dbb416d4feaa9ccfa216c771dc49d503ac5870d6
ead80b1ba417,You’ll soon be able to shop Walmart from ChatGPT,,"Walmart announced on Tuesday a new partnership with OpenAI that will allow consumers to shop Walmart’s products via the AI chatbot, including things like groceries (not fresh food), household essentials, and more, and then instantly check out. The agentic shopping feature will also allow Sam’s Club members to plan meals and restock essentials while also discovering new items when chatting with the AI, the company says. To use the feature, customers will press a “buy” button in ChatGPT’s app when they shop, after linking their Walmart accounts to ChatGPT. Products from third-party sellers will also be supported when the feature rolls out later this fall. Walmart explains that the new agreement with OpenAI will allow the retailer to better learn and predict customers’ needs, making online shopping more personalized and proactive, instead of only reactive. The partnership follows OpenAI’s recent announcement of its plan to enter the world of e-commerce with an agentic shopping system , which includes product discovery, recommendation, and payments. Initially, OpenAI is teaming up with Etsy and Shopify sellers, the company said. The ChatGPT-focused shopping feature won’t be the only way consumers can shop with AI. Alongside other AI investments, Walmart recently introduced its own generative AI shopping assistant, Sparky, designed to help customers discover and compare products and make purchases. The feature will expand to include reordering, service booking, and understanding multimodal inputs from text, images, audio, and video. The retailer has an existing relationship with OpenAI in other areas of its business, as well, having adopted OpenAI Certifications and ChatGPT Enterprise for its internal teams. Both Walmart and Sam’s Club broadly use AI to do other things, like speeding up fashion production by up to 18 weeks and improving customer care time frames by up to 40%. “For many years now, e-commerce shopping experiences have consisted of a search bar and a long list of item responses. That is about to change,” noted Walmart President and CEO Doug McMillon in a prepared statement. “There is a native AI experience coming that is multimedia, personalized, and contextual. We are running towards that more enjoyable and convenient future with Sparky and through partnerships, including this important step with OpenAI,” he added.",https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/14/youll-soon-be-able-to-shop-walmart-from-chatgpt,Technology,BBC,Sarah Perez,https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/GettyImages-1228097014.jpg?w=1024,2025-10-14T15:32:23+00:00,30676ef5fc84c6ce1435ffb6a415926f11c8f1d9
88b0c601c2f8,OpenAI and Broadcom partner on AI hardware,,"OpenAI has landed a new hardware partner. The AI research lab announced Monday it formed a partnership with semiconductor company Broadcom for 10 gigawatts’ worth of custom AI accelerator hardware. These AI accelerator racks will be deployed to OpenAI data centers and partner data centers starting in 2026 and running through 2029. “By designing its own chips and systems, OpenAI can embed what it’s learned from developing frontier models and products directly into the hardware, unlocking new levels of capability and intelligence,” the company said in a press release. While terms of the deal were not disclosed, the Financial Times estimated it could cost OpenAI an estimated $350 billion to $500 billion . This is just the latest infrastructure deal for OpenAI in recent weeks. Last week, OpenAI announced it was purchasing an additional six gigawatts of chips from AMD in a deal worth tens of billions of dollars. In September, Nvidia announced it was investing $100 billion into OpenAI alongside a letter of intent for OpenAI to tap 10 gigawatts’ worth of Nvidia hardware.

b825495234fd,"Google updates Search and Discover with collapsible ads, AI features, and more",,"Google is rolling out a series of changes to its Search and Discover pages, the company shared across multiple announcements . The updates will bring new AI-powered features to these key destinations, while also improving navigation and allowing users to collapse ads on Google Search. Given that ads are Google’s primary cash cow, the latter initially seems like a more surprising change. The feature will now allow users browsing Google’s Search results to tap a new button, “Hide sponsored results,” to collapse the ads at the top of the search results page. Image Credits: Google However, while this action will remove the ads from displaying on the screen, sponsored results are not going away entirely. Instead, Google notes that the “Sponsored Results” label will remain at the top of the screen as you scroll down. In a way, this makes the ads more prominent as they can follow you down the page, even though they’re collapsed. Plus, Google says that the “Sponsored results” header can appear both above and below AI Overviews — the short AI-written summaries that appear at the top of search results to provide quick answers. The “Sponsored results” header for text ads will also appear at the bottom of the page, with all text ads grouped under the label. These can be collapsed with the same “Hide sponsored results” button if you want to focus on organic content. Google says the new design makes it easier for people to navigate to the top of the page, and it keeps the size of ads the same, with users never seeing more than four text ads in a group. The new “Sponsored” label will show up in other places across Google, too, including Shopping ads, where it will be branded as “Sponsored Products.” The updates will roll out across desktop and mobile. The company is also making other changes across Search and Discover. When searching for sports information, like looking up players or teams, you’ll now see a new “What’s New” button that displays a feed of trending updates and news articles that could help you catch up with the latest. This will roll out to Google Search in the U.S. in the weeks ahead. Meanwhile, the Google app’s Discover feed on mobile will introduce an AI-powered feature that also helps you keep up with trending topics you’re interested in. Here, the app will display short previews that you can expand to see more information, plus other links to explore. The company says this feature is designed to help users stay up to date on stories from a variety of publishers, but it also comes at a time when publishers are seeing their search traffic decline due to the shift to AI-provided answers and consumers’ changing media habits. This latter feature is rolling out now to the U.S., South Korea, and India.",https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/14/google-updates-search-and-discover-with-collapsible-ads-ai-features-and-more,Technology,BBC,Sarah Perez,"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/google-search-app-ios.jpg?resize=1200,644",2025-10-14T15:12:42+00:00,7db509fd4036e8ccbacc25275a6079d1c1415122
1d46d45acf53,YouTube makes it easier for teens to find informative mental health content,,"YouTube announced Tuesday the launch of a new dedicated section for teen-focused mental health and well-being content, making it easier for users 13-17 years old to find age-appropriate information on topics like depression, anxiety, ADHD, and eating disorders. When adolescents search for terms like “depression” in the search bar, a specific row of videos appears at the top of the results. According to YouTube, these videos come from reputable sources and are tailored to the developmental stage of teenagers. The company collaborated with organizations that specialize in mental health and well-being information for young people, such as the Child Mind Institute. Image Credits: YouTube This launch signifies a move toward making YouTube a trustworthy resource for younger users facing mental health challenges. A 2023 survey from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) indicates that 39.7% of students felt ongoing sadness and hopelessness, while 28.5% reported poor mental health. This is a notable addition for the platform as it’s important to reach teens where they already seek information, such as YouTube, with nine out of 10 teens reporting they use the platform, according to the Pew Research Center. Over the years, YouTube has invested in various initiatives to assist teenagers. These include implementing specific safeguards when recommending certain topics to teens, using age-estimation technology to recognize teenage users for a more suitable experience, and providing parental controls that allow parents to link their accounts to their teens’ accounts . The new mental health and well-being offering is rolling out to users in the U.S., the U.K., Canada, Mexico, France, and Australia in the coming weeks.",https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/14/youtube-makes-it-easier-for-teens-to-find-informative-mental-health-content,Technology,BBC,Lauren Forristal,https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/youtube-ios-app.webp?w=1024,2025-10-14T15:04:13+00:00,642c16d48974b79aadda851b58819c29111e4b77
7bbeb836a738,Sheryl Sandberg-backed Flint wants to use AI to autonomously build and update websites,,"Sometimes, you can only spot what’s wrong when you’ve been part of the process for a while. That was the case for Michelle Lim, who, while running Warp ’s growth marketing efforts through last year, realized that the company wasn’t updating its website quickly enough. She noticed that potential customers were asking ChatGPT and other AI bots all kinds of questions about Warp’s offering, but the information they sought, such as how the product compared with a newer competitor, wasn’t available on the startup’s website. Lim felt that this content gap would become even more critical as next-generation AI agents begin actively crawling the internet to gather intelligence for users. It was clear that Warp needed to add more content, but making and uploading each additional web page was a time-consuming task involving a design agency and multiple people across different departments. “Marketers just can’t wait one month for design and development teams to build the page,” she told TechCrunch. “With AI engines, you need to be producing content a lot faster than before to capture your consumer demand.” Lim, who had long planned to launch a startup, recognized that this was fast becoming a problem that needed solving. So, in March, she co-founded Flint , an AI platform that lets you set up websites that update themselves. Joining her in the effort was Max Levenson, an engineer who previously led simulation and infrastructure teams for autonomous vehicle startup Nuro. On Tuesday, Flint emerged from stealth mode with $5 million in seed funding. The investment was led by Accel, and saw participation from Sheryl Sandberg’s fund, Sandberg Bernthal Venture Partners, and existing backer Neo. Flint’s goal is to create websites that continuously optimize themselves, perform their own A/B tests, and dynamically learn from both visitors and market trends, such as a sudden interest in a specific keyword. Flint also aims to generate pages customized to each visitor, much like how Amazon shows you customized product recommendations. Techcrunch event San Francisco | October 27-29, 2025 That said, Flint’s technology isn’t ready to do all of that just yet. “For now, users still have to tell us what they want to build,” Lim said. In its current form, once the parameters are set, Flint can automatically generate a web page’s design and layout, interactive elements (like tables and buttons), and also offer form tracking and ad optimization. Lim claims the platform can do all of this in “about a day,” though she didn’t give any more details. “At this point, customers provide their own copy,” Lim said. She added that while Flint’s content writing functionality is roughly a year away, future versions will give customers the option to have AI write the text. Even without that, Lim claims that whipping up a page with all of the necessary components in a day is already a big time-saver for its customers. Flint says it doesn’t design sites or “vibe code” anything. For existing websites, its technology analyzes the look and feel to build and deploy fully coded web pages that are consistent with the design. The startup is already working with customers like Cognition, Modal, and Graphite, for whom it has created live pages. You can see Windsurf’s here , Modal’s site , and this is what Graphite’s looks like . Flint’s ambition is to help marketers at rapidly growing startups and Fortune 500 companies increase their websites’ visibility and create content. The focus on selling to CMOs is what made Lim so excited to have Sheryl Sandberg join as an investor. “I like to think of her as someone who has influenced the way the internet has monetized over the past decade,” Lim said. According to Lim, Sandberg instantly understood Flint’s vision. “I was showing her this deck, and I was sharing how, in my personal experience, it took five teams three months to build one A/B test just to increase conversion by 10% on our Google ad,” Lim said. “And then she stopped me, [and] said, ‘Michelle, it was 140 people at Meta who had to do this’.”",https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/14/sheryl-sandberg-backed-flint-wants-to-use-ai-to-autonomously-build-and-update-websites,Technology,BBC,Marina Temkin,"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/DSC09795-1.jpg?resize=1200,801",2025-10-14T15:03:30+00:00,6e1d04d678338b39efc3847b68c266b043bacdc6

e6308568de87,"Spotify expands parent-managed accounts for kids to more countries, including the US",,"Spotify announced on Tuesday that it’s making Managed Accounts, a shared account feature that allows parents to control what their children listen to, available to users in more countries. Managed Accounts are now rolling out in the U.S., U.K., Canada, Australia, Germany, France, and the Netherlands following a pilot launch last year. Managed Accounts are available to Spotify Premium Family plan members and allow account holders to manage a separate music-only listening experience for their kids under the age of 13. Since these accounts are separate, your kids’ music choices won’t impact your algorithm or show up in your annual Spotify Wrapped experience. Kids can add songs to their favorites, create their own playlists, and have their own personalized recommendations. With Managed Accounts, parents can restrict access to certain features, such as watching videos, playing content, or viewing Canvas videos, which are the looping visuals that appear during music playback, for any content labeled as explicit. Parents can also control and restrict the playback of specific artists and songs. Interactivity features are also limited on managed accounts, which means that kids won’t get access to age-gated features like Messages. Managed Accounts allow parents to make more granular decisions about the kind of music their child can listen to, without forcing them to use the more restrictive Spotify Kids app. To set up the managed account, Family Plan account holders need to navigate to their account pages in the app, select the “Add a Member” option, and then select the option to “Add a listener aged under 13 (or the market equivalent),” then follow the instructions to navigate the various options. Techcrunch event San Francisco | October 27-29, 2025 Spotify’s Managed Accounts are already available in New Zealand, Sweden, Denmark, Spain, Italy, Portugal, Brazil, Mexico, Argentina, and Colombia.

0f38b6091072,Revolut’s UK banking license may be delayed due to risk management concerns,,"U.K. fintech Revolut has hit yet another roadblock to its longstanding mission of becoming a real bank in its home country: Its full banking license is being held up because the country’s central bank is concerned about whether the startup can maintain its risk management controls in the face of its blazing fast international expansion, the Financial Times reported. The Bank of England wants Revolut to commit to building its risk management stack to match its international growth before the regulator can approve a full banking license, the Financial Times reported, and regulators are looking at the fintech’s controls in the U.K. and internationally. Revolut got approval to receive a banking license in the U.K. more than a year ago , but is still in the so-called “ mobilization ” stage. This phase typically lasts 12 months and imposes deposit restrictions while a bank completes the final steps of setup and the Prudential Regulation Authority or Financial Conduct Authority assess whether it is ready to operate as a full-fledged bank. Importantly, having a full banking license would allow Revolut to start lending in the U.K., and hold more than £50,000 in customer deposits. The company has 12 million customers in the U.K. News of the delay comes as Revolut, with more than 65 million customers worldwide, has moved aggressively to expand beyond Britain. The company already has a banking license in the European Union, and it operates in Australia, Japan, New Zealand, Singapore, Brazil, and the U.S. Just last week, it launched operations in India ; it is also about to start operating in Colombia in 2026, has plans to launch in Argentina and Mexico, wants to enter Africa (first with South Africa), and has an in-principal payments license in the UAE. The company has grand ambitions , aiming to reach 100 million customers by mid-2027, and enter over 30 new markets by 2030. “We are progressing through the final stages of mobilization and continue to work constructively with the PRA,” a Revolut spokesperson said in an emailed statement. “Given Revolut’s global scale, this is the largest and most complex mobilization ever undertaken in the U.K. A thorough review is an expected part of the process, and getting this right is more important than rushing to meet a specific date.” Techcrunch event San Francisco | October 27-29, 2025 Per its last annual report , Revolut reported net profit of $1 billion (£790 million) in 2024, while revenues increased 72% to $4 billion (£3.1 billion) in the year.

efd844dfbb68,The Sun’s hidden poles could finally reveal its greatest secrets,space exploration; solar flare; space telescopes; nasa; satellites; black holes; sun; space missions,"The Sun's polar regions remain one of the least explored areas in solar science. Space-based observatories and ground telescopes have given us extraordinary images of the Sun's surface, atmosphere, and magnetic fields, but nearly all of those observations come from within the ecliptic plane -- the narrow zone where Earth and most other planets orbit. This viewing angle limits what scientists can see of the Sun's high-latitude poles. Yet these regions are crucial, as their magnetic fields and dynamic activity help shape the solar magnetic cycle and supply the mass and energy that feed the fast solar wind, influencing solar behavior and driving space weather throughout the solar system. Why the Poles Matter At first glance, the Sun's poles seem calm compared to the active mid-latitudes around ±35°, where sunspots, solar flares, and coronal mass ejections (CMEs) dominate. But appearances are deceiving. The magnetic fields at the poles are vital to the Sun's global dynamo process and may act as ""seed fields"" that shape the next solar cycle, defining the overall solar magnetic structure. Data from the Ulysses spacecraft showed that the fast solar wind originates mainly from vast coronal holes near the poles. Understanding these regions is therefore key to answering three of the most important questions in solar physics: 1. How does the solar dynamo operate and drive the magnetic cycle? The Sun's magnetic cycle is a repeating pattern that lasts about 11 years, marked by fluctuations in sunspot numbers and a complete reversal of the Sun's magnetic poles. This process is driven by a complex dynamo mechanism powered by the Sun's internal motion. Differential rotation produces magnetic activity, while meridional circulation carries magnetic flux toward the poles. However, decades of helioseismic studies have revealed conflicting information about how these flows behave deep inside the convection zone. Some evidence even points to poleward flows at the base of the zone, challenging traditional dynamo theories. Observations from high latitudes are needed to clarify these internal flow patterns and refine existing models. 2. What powers the fast solar wind? The fast solar wind -- a supersonic stream of charged particles -- originates mainly in the Sun's polar coronal holes and fills most of the heliosphere, shaping conditions in interplanetary space. Yet scientists still do not fully understand how it begins. Does it emerge from dense plumes inside the coronal holes, or from the more diffuse regions between them? Are magnetic reconnection events, wave interactions, or both responsible for accelerating the flow? Only direct imaging of the poles and in-situ measurements can resolve these long-standing questions. 3. How do space weather events spread through the solar system? Space weather refers to changes in the solar wind and solar eruptions that disturb the space environment. Extreme events such as powerful flares and CMEs can trigger geomagnetic and ionospheric storms on Earth, creating dazzling auroras but also threatening satellites, communication systems, and power grids. To improve forecasts, researchers must follow how solar material and magnetic structures evolve across the Sun and through space, not just from the limited perspective of Earth's orbital plane. Observing from outside the ecliptic would provide a crucial top-down view, helping scientists trace how CMEs and other disturbances travel through the solar system. Past Efforts Scientists have long recognized the importance of solar polar observations. The Ulysses mission, launched in 1990, was the first spacecraft to leave the ecliptic plane and sample the solar wind over the poles. Its in-situ instruments confirmed key properties of the fast solar wind but lacked imaging capability. More recently, the European Space Agency's Solar Orbiter has been gradually moving out of the ecliptic plane and is expected to reach latitudes of around 34° in a few years. While this represents a remarkable progress, it still falls far short of the vantage needed for a true polar view. A number of ambitious mission concepts have been proposed over the past decades, including the Solar Polar Imager (SPI), the POLAR Investigation of the Sun (POLARIS), the Solar Polar ORbit Telescope (SPORT), the Solaris mission, and the High Inclination Solar Mission (HISM). Some envisioned using advanced propulsion such as solar sails to reach high inclinations. Others relied on gravity assists to incrementally tilt their orbits. Each of these missions would carry both remote-sensing and in-situ instruments to image the Sun's poles and measure key physical parameters above the poles. The SPO Mission The Solar Polar-orbit Observatory (SPO) is designed specifically to overcome the limitations of past and current missions. Scheduled for launch in January 2029, SPO will use a Jupiter gravity assist (JGA) to bend its trajectory out of the ecliptic plane. After several Earth flybys and a carefully planned encounter with Jupiter, the spacecraft will settle into a 1.5-year orbit with a perihelion of about 1 AU and an inclination of up to 75°. In its extended mission, SPO could climb to 80°, offering the most direct view of the poles ever achieved. The 15-year lifetime of the mission (including an 7-year extended mission period) will allow it to cover both solar minimum and maximum, including the crucial period around 2035 when the next solar maximum and expected polar magnetic field reversal will occur. During the whole lifetime, SPO will repeatedly pass over both poles, with extended high-latitude observation windows lasting more than 1000 days. The SPO mission aims at breakthroughs on the three scientific questions mentioned above. To meet its ambitious objectives, SPO will carry a suite of several remote-sensing and in-situ instruments. Together, they will provide a comprehensive view of the Sun's poles. The remote-sensing instruments include the Magnetic and Helioseismic Imager (MHI) to measure magnetic fields and plasma flows at the surface, the Extreme Ultraviolet Telescope (EUT) and the X-ray Imaging Telescope (XIT) to capture dynamic events in the solar upper atmosphere, the VISible-light CORonagraph (VISCOR) and the Very Large Angle CORonagraph (VLACOR) to track the solar corona and solar wind streams out to 45 solar radii (at 1 AU). The in-situ package includes a magnetometer and particle detectors to sample the solar wind and interplanetary magnetic field directly. By combining these observations, SPO will not only capture images of the poles for the first time but also connect them to the flows of plasma and magnetic energy that shape the heliosphere. SPO will not operate in isolation. It is expected to work in concert with a growing fleet of solar missions. These include the STEREO Mission, the Hinode satellite, the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO), the Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph (IRIS), the Advanced Space-based Solar Observatory (ASO-S), the Solar Orbiter, the Aditya-L1 mission, the PUNCH mission, as well as the upcoming L5 missions (e.g., ESA's Vigil mission and China's LAVSO mission). Together, these assets will form an unprecedented observational network. SPO's polar vantage will provide the missing piece, enabling nearly global 4π coverage of the Sun for the first time in human history. Looking Ahead The Sun is our nearest star, yet much about it remains unknown. The upcoming Solar Polar-orbit Observatory (SPO) mission is expected to change that by giving scientists an unprecedented look at the Sun's polar regions. These areas, which have long been hidden from direct view, will soon be observed in detail, offering new insight into the forces that shape our star and sustain life on Earth. The importance of SPO goes far beyond pure scientific curiosity. By improving knowledge of the solar dynamo, the mission could lead to more accurate predictions of the solar cycle and, in turn, more reliable space weather forecasts. Understanding how the fast solar wind forms and behaves will also refine models of the heliosphere, which is vital for spacecraft engineering and astronaut safety. Most significantly, advances in tracking solar activity could strengthen our ability to safeguard critical technologies, including navigation and communication satellites, aviation systems, and power grids on Earth.",https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/10/251014014438.htm,Science,BBC,,https://www.sciencedaily.com/images/1920/solar-polar-orbit-observatory-schematic.webp,,3b9011aadb27dc87ef0e6447253e1bd089403db5
28936a0635bb,A telescope larger than Earth just revealed the hidden heart of a mysterious galaxy,space exploration; black holes; space telescopes; nasa; satellites; dark matter; cosmic rays; extrasolar planets,"For more than a century and a half, astronomers have been captivated by the distant galaxy OJ 287, located about five billion light years from Earth. Its puzzling variations in brightness have long hinted that two enormous black holes may be orbiting and merging at its center. Now, an international team led by Dr. Efthalia Traianou of Heidelberg University has captured a highly detailed image of the galaxy's core, revealing features never seen before. Using a space-based radio telescope, the researchers produced an image that uncovers a sharply curved section of a plasma jet streaming from the galaxy's center, offering fresh insight into the extreme environments surrounding supermassive black holes. OJ 287 is classified as a blazar, a type of active galaxy known for its intense energy and brightness. At its heart lies a supermassive black hole that draws in matter from nearby space and propels some of it outward in colossal plasma jets filled with radiation, heat, magnetic fields, and heavy particles. ""We have never before observed a structure in the OJ 287 galaxy at the level of detail seen in the new image,"" said Dr. Traianou, a postdoctoral researcher working with Dr. Roman Gold at Heidelberg University's Interdisciplinary Center for Scientific Computing. The image penetrates deeply into the galaxy's center, revealing a sharply bent, ribbon-like jet structure and providing clues about the plasma's composition and motion. Some areas reach temperatures of around ten trillion degrees Kelvin, showing just how much energy is being released near the black hole. The scientists also detected a new shock wave forming and colliding along the jet, which they linked to trillion-electron-volt energy levels observed in an unusual gamma-ray signal detected in 2017. To obtain this remarkable view, the researchers used a ground-space radio interferometer that combined a radio telescope in Earth's orbit (the ten-meter antenna of the RadioAstron mission aboard the Spektr-R satellite) with 27 ground-based observatories around the world. By linking signals from these observatories, they effectively created a virtual telescope five times wider than Earth's diameter. The extraordinary resolution of the resulting image comes from measuring how light waves overlap, taking full advantage of the wave properties of light itself. The interferometric image underpins the assumption that a binary supermassive black hole is located inside galaxy OJ 287. It also provides important information on how the movements of such black holes influence the form and orientation of the plasma jets emitted. ""Its special properties make the galaxy an ideal candidate for further research into merging black holes and the associated gravitational waves,"" states Efthalia Traianou. Institutions from Germany, Italy, Russia, Spain, South Korea, and the US all contributed to the research. It was supported by various research and funding institutions.

677a972e31a1,JWST may have found the Universe’s first stars powered by dark matter,space exploration; black holes; space telescopes; nasa; physics; quantum physics; albert einstein; thermodynamics,"In the early universe, a few hundred million years after the Big Bang, the first stars emerged from vast, untouched clouds of hydrogen and helium. Recent observations from the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) suggest that some of these early stars may have been unlike the familiar (nuclear fusion-powered) stars that astronomers have studied for centuries. A new study led by Cosmin Ilie of Colgate University, together with Shafaat Mahmud (Colgate '26), Jillian Paulin (Colgate '23) at the University of Pennsylvania, and Katherine Freese at The University of Texas at Austin, has identified four extremely distant objects whose appearance and spectral signatures match what scientists expect from supermassive dark stars. ""Supermassive dark stars are extremely bright, giant, yet puffy clouds made primarily out of hydrogen and helium, which are supported against gravitational collapse by the minute amounts of self-annihilating dark matter inside them,"" Ilie said. Supermassive dark stars and their black hole remnants could be key to solving two recent astronomical puzzles: i. the larger than expected extremely bright, yet compact, very distant galaxies observed with JWST, and ii. the origin of the supermassive black holes powering the most distant quasars observed. Katherine Freese first proposed the idea of dark stars with Doug Spolyar and Paolo Gondolo, publishing their initial peer-reviewed paper on the concept in Physical Review Letters in 2008. That study outlined how dark stars might grow and eventually collapse into supermassive black holes in the early universe. In 2010, Freese, Ilie, Spolyar, and their collaborators expanded on the theory in The Astrophysical Journal , describing two possible processes that could allow dark stars to reach immense sizes and predicting that they could seed the black holes found in the earliest quasars known to exist. Dark matter is thought to make up roughly a quarter of the universe, yet its nature remains one of science's greatest mysteries. Researchers believe it is composed of a still-undetected type of elementary particle. Decades of experiments have searched for these particles, but so far without success. One leading possibility involves Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs). When two WIMPs collide, they are expected to annihilate each other, releasing energy that could heat collapsing hydrogen clouds and cause them to shine as brilliant dark stars. Conditions a few hundred million years after the Big Bang, within dense regions called dark matter halos, appear to have been ideal for forming such stars. These regions are also where the first generation of normal stars was expected to appear. ""For the first time we have identified spectroscopic supermassive dark star candidates in JWST, including the earliest objects at redshift 14, only 300 Myr after the Big Bang,"" said Freese, the Jeff and Gail Kodosky Endowed Chair in Physics and director of the Weinberg Institute and Texas Center for Cosmology and Astroparticle Physics at UT Austin. ""Weighing a million times as much as the Sun, such early dark stars are important not only in teaching us about dark matter but also as precursors to the early supermassive black holes seen in JWST that are otherwise so difficult to explain."" In a 2023 PNAS study by Ilie, Paulin, and Freese, the first supermassive dark star candidates (JADES-GS-z13-0, JADES-GS-z12-0, and JADES-GS-z11-0) were identified using photometric data from JWST's NIRCam instrument. Since then, spectra from JWST's NIRSpec instrument became available for those, and a few other extremely distant objects. The team, which now also includes Shafaat Mahmud analyzed the spectra and morphology of four of the most distant objects ever observed (including two candidates from the 2023 study): JADES-GS-z14-0, JADES-GS-z14-1, JADES-GS-13-0, and JADES-GS-z11-0 and found that each of them is consistent with a supermassive dark star interpretation. JADES-GS-z14-1 is not resolved, meaning it is consistent with a point source, such as a very distant supermassive star would be. The other three are extremely compact, and can be modeled by supermassive dark stars powering a nebula (i.e. ionized H and He gas surrounding the star). Each of the four objects analyzed in this study is also consistent with a galaxy interpretation, as shown in the literature. Dark stars have a smoking gun signature, an absorption feature at 1640 Angstrom, due to the large amounts of singly ionized helium in their atmospheres. And in fact, one of the four objects analyzed shows signs of this feature. ""One of the most exciting moments during this research was when we found the 1640 Angstrom absorption dip in the spectrum of JADES-GS-z14-0. While the signal to noise ratio of this feature is relatively low (S/N~2), it is for the first time we found a potential smoking gun signature of a dark star. Which, in itself, is remarkable,"" Ilie said. Astronomers using the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) measured the spectrum of the same object, revealing the presence of oxygen, via a nebular emission line. Researchers said that if both spectral features are confirmed, the object cannot be an isolated dark star, but rather may be a dark star embedded in a metal rich environment. This could be the outcome of a merger, where a dark matter halo hosting a dark star merges with a galaxy. Alternatively, dark stars and regular stars could have formed in the same host halo, as the researchers now realized it is possible. The identification of supermassive dark stars would open up the possibility of learning about the dark matter particle based on the observed properties of those objects, and would establish a new field of astronomy: the study of dark matter-powered stars. This published PNAS research is a key step in this direction.

43cc2ec16976,Scientists find the brain’s hidden pulse that may predict Alzheimer’s,heart disease; today&amp;#039;s healthcare; hypertension; medical devices; dementia; alzheimer&amp;#039;s; stroke; intelligence,"Scientists at the Mark and Mary Stevens Neuroimaging and Informatics Institute (Stevens INI) at the Keck School of Medicine of USC have created a pioneering brain imaging method that captures how the brain's smallest blood vessels pulse in time with each heartbeat. These subtle movements may offer vital insights into aging and conditions such as Alzheimer's disease. Published in Nature Cardiovascular Research , the study presents the first noninvasive approach for measuring ""microvascular volumetric pulsatility"" -- the rhythmic swelling and shrinking of tiny blood vessels -- in living humans. Using ultra-high field 7T magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), the researchers found that these microvessel pulses become stronger with age, particularly in the brain's deep white matter. This region is essential for communication between brain networks but is also vulnerable to reduced blood flow from distal arteries, which carry blood from the heart to the outermost parts of the body. As these pulses intensify, they may interfere with brain function and contribute to memory decline and Alzheimer's progression. ""Arterial pulsation is like the brain's natural pump, helping to move fluids and clear waste,"" said Danny JJ Wang, PhD, professor of neurology and radiology at the Keck School of Medicine and senior author of the study. ""Our new method allows us to see, for the first time in people, how the volumes of those tiny blood vessels change with aging and vascular risk factors. This opens new avenues for studying brain health, dementia, and small vessel disease."" Scientists have long recognized that stiffness and excessive pulsation in large arteries are linked to stroke, dementia, and small vessel disease. However, until now, it has been nearly impossible to observe these rhythmic changes in the brain's smallest vessels without using invasive procedures limited to animal studies. To overcome this, the USC team combined two advanced MRI techniques -- vascular space occupancy (VASO) and arterial spin labeling (ASL) -- to monitor subtle shifts in microvessel volume throughout the cardiac cycle. Their results revealed that older adults exhibit stronger microvascular pulsations in deep white matter compared to younger individuals, and that hypertension further intensifies these effects. ""These findings provide a missing link between what we see in large vessel imaging and the microvascular damage we observe in aging and Alzheimer's disease,"" said lead author Fanhua Guo, PhD, a postdoctoral researcher in Wang's lab. Excessive vascular pulsation may also disrupt the brain's ""glymphatic system,"" a recently discovered network that removes waste substances such as beta-amyloid, a protein that accumulates in Alzheimer's disease. Over time, interference with this fluid circulation could hasten cognitive decline. ""Being able to measure these tiny vascular pulses in vivo is a critical step forward,"" said Arthur W. Toga, PhD, director of the Stevens INI. ""This technology not only advances our understanding of brain aging but also holds promise for early diagnosis and monitoring of neurodegenerative disorders."" The researchers are exploring how the method could be adapted for wider clinical use, including on more commonly available 3T MRI scanners. Future studies will test whether microvascular volumetric pulsatility predicts cognitive outcomes and whether it can serve as a biomarker for early intervention in Alzheimer's disease and related conditions. ""This is just the beginning,"" Wang said. ""Our goal is to bring this from research labs into clinical practice, where it could guide diagnosis, prevention, and treatment strategies for millions at risk of dementia.""

eb600533ff2e,Supercharged vitamin k could help the brain heal itself,today&amp;#039;s healthcare; osteoporosis; pharmacology; stem cells; huntington&amp;#039;s disease; intelligence; neuroscience; dementia,"Neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and Huntington's disease occur when neurons gradually deteriorate and die. This progressive loss of brain cells leads to severe symptoms including memory decline, cognitive impairment, and difficulty with movement. Over time, these conditions can greatly diminish quality of life and often leave patients dependent on continuous care. Current medications can help ease symptoms but do not stop or reverse the underlying disease, highlighting the urgent need for new therapeutic approaches. One promising strategy focuses on stimulating neuronal differentiation, the process of forming new neurons that could replace those lost and potentially slow or counteract neurodegeneration. Vitamin K, a fat-soluble nutrient best known for its role in blood clotting and bone health, has recently attracted attention for its influence on brain cell development and protection. However, naturally occurring vitamin K forms such as menaquinone 4 (MK-4) may not be potent enough for effective use in regenerative therapies targeting neurodegenerative disorders. In a groundbreaking study published in ACS Chemical Neuroscience , researchers from the Department of Bioscience and Engineering at Shibaura Institute of Technology in Japan, led by Associate Professor Yoshihisa Hirota and Professor Yoshitomo Suhara, created and tested new vitamin K analogues with stronger neuroactive effects. The team also identified a distinct mechanism through which vitamin K promotes neuronal differentiation. Explaining their findings, Dr. Hirota noted, ""The newly synthesized vitamin K analogues demonstrated approximately threefold greater potency in inducing the differentiation of neural progenitor cells into neurons compared to natural vitamin K. Since neuronal loss is a hallmark of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, these analogues may serve as regenerative agents that help replenish lost neurons and restore brain function."" To boost vitamin K's biological impact, the team produced 12 hybrid vitamin K homologs by linking them with retinoic acid (an active metabolite of vitamin A that encourages neuronal differentiation), a carboxylic acid group, or a methyl ester side chain. They then evaluated how effectively each compound promoted neuronal differentiation. Vitamin K and retinoic acid influence gene transcription through the steroid and xenobiotic receptor (SXR) and retinoic acid receptor (RAR), respectively. The researchers measured SXR and RAR activity in mouse neural progenitor cells treated with the newly developed compounds and found that the hybrids maintained the biological functions of both parent molecules. They also measured the expression of microtubule-associated protein 2 (Map2), a neuronal growth marker, to track cell differentiation. One compound, which combined retinoic acid with a methyl ester side chain, produced a threefold increase in neuronal differentiation compared with the control and showed significantly stronger activity than natural vitamin K. This enhanced version was designated as the Novel vitamin K analog (Novel VK). To better understand how vitamin K protects neurons, the team compared gene expression patterns in neural stem cells treated with MK-4, which promotes neuronal differentiation, to those treated with a compound that suppresses it. Transcriptomic analysis revealed that vitamin K-induced neuronal differentiation is mediated by metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) through downstream epigenetic and transcriptional processes. The effect of MK-4 was specifically linked to mGluR1. Previous studies have shown that mGluR1 plays a key role in synaptic communication, and that mice lacking this receptor experience motor and synaptic impairments similar to those seen in neurodegenerative disorders. Delving deeper, the researchers conducted structural simulations and molecular docking studies to elucidate whether the vitamin K homolog interacts with mGluR1. Indeed, their analysis revealed a stronger binding affinity between Novel VK and mGluR1. Finally, the researchers examined the cellular uptake of Novel VK and its conversion to bioactive MK-4 in cells and mice. They noted a significant concentration-dependent increase in the intracellular concentration of MK-4. Moreover, Novel VK converted to MK-4 more easily than natural vitamin K. Further, in vivo experiments in mice showed that Novel VK exhibited a stable pharmacokinetic profile, crossed the blood-brain barrier, and achieved higher MK-4 concentration in the brain compared to the control. Overall, the study sheds light on the mechanism by which vitamin K and its structural analogues exert neuroprotective effects, paving the way for the development of novel therapeutic agents that can delay or reverse neurodegenerative diseases. Concluding with the long-term implications of their work, Dr. Hirota says, ""Our research offers a potentially groundbreaking approach to treating neurodegenerative diseases. A vitamin K-derived drug that slows the progression of Alzheimer's disease or improves its symptoms could not only improve the quality of life for patients and their families but also significantly reduce the growing societal burden of healthcare expenditures and long-term caregiving."" We hope their research translates into clinically meaningful treatments for patients battling neurological diseases.

c7152cd8bda9,A simple fatty acid could restore failing vision,eye care; personalized medicine; diseases and conditions; alternative medicine; healthy aging; fitness; gene therapy; today&amp;#039;s healthcare,"Changes in eyesight are one of the most familiar effects of getting older. Sit in a dim restaurant with someone over 60, and you might hear, ""Hold on -- let me pull out my cell phone. I need more light to read the menu!"" But what if declining vision with age could actually be reversed? Researchers at UC Irvine have taken a closer look at that question, investigating a potential treatment aimed at slowing or even undoing ""aging"" in the eye while also preventing age-related diseases such as macular degeneration (AMD). ""We show the potential for reversing age-related vision loss,"" explains Dorota Skowronska-Krawczyk, PhD, an associate professor in the Department of Physiology and Biophysics and the Department of Ophthalmology and Visual Sciences. The study, conducted in partnership with scientists from the Polish Academy of Sciences and the Health and Medical University in Potsdam, Germany, presents findings published in Science Translational Medicine under the title ""Retinal polyunsaturated fatty acid supplementation reverses aging-related vision decline in mice."" Understanding the ""Aging"" Gene This research builds on earlier work involving the Elongation of Very Long Chain Fatty Acids Protein 2 (ELOVL2), a well-established biomarker of aging. ""We showed that we have lower vision when this ELOVL2 enzyme isn't active,"" says Skowronska-Krawczyk, who is also part of the Robert M. Brunson Center for Translational Vision Research at the UC Irvine School of Medicine. In that previous study, boosting ELOVL2 activity in aging mice increased levels of the omega−3 fatty acid docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) in the eye and led to better vision. The new research aimed to find a way to achieve similar benefits without depending on the ELOVL2 enzyme. As people age, changes in lipid metabolism reduce the amount of very-long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (VLC-PUFAs) in the retina. This decline can impair vision and contribute to AMD. The ELOVL2 gene plays a crucial role in producing both VLC-PUFAs and DHA. When researchers injected older mice with a specific polyunsaturated fatty acid, their visual performance improved. ""It's a proof-of-concept for turning lipid injection into a possible therapy,"" says Skowronska-Krawczyk. ""What is important is that we didn't see the same effect with DHA."" Others have also questioned the ability of DHA to slow AMD progression. ""Our work really confirms the fact that DHA alone cannot do the work, but we have this other fatty acid that is seemingly working and improving vision in aged animals,"" says Skowronska-Krawczyk. ""We have also shown on a molecular level that it actually reverses the aging features."" Furthermore, the researchers found genetic variants in the ELOVL2 enzyme that correlate with faster progression of AMD. ""Now we actually have a genetic connection to the disease and its aging aspect,"" says Skowronska-Krawczyk, ""so we could potentially identify people at higher risk for vision loss progression."" This could lead to not only therapeutic treatment options but also targeted interventions for prevention. These findings have only further solidified Skowronska-Krawczyk's view of the importance of the ELOVL2 enzyme. ""I am pretty convinced it's one of the top aging genes that we should look at when we think about anti-aging therapies."" Looking Beyond the Retina In a collaboration with researchers from UC San Diego, Skowronska-Krawczyk has also started to explore the role of lipid metabolism in immune system aging. That study found that the lack of ELOVL2 enzyme induces accelerated aging of immune cells, suggesting that systemic lipid supplementation could potentially counteract the effects of age on the immune system. It also suggested that lipid metabolism might play a role in blood cancers.

He describes these advances as ""giving us leads we did not have forty years ago."" Through this approach, his team has identified key disruptions in how brain cells generate energy and connect with one another -- processes that appear central to many psychiatric illnesses affecting millions globally. With more than 400 scientific papers and five patents, his research points to new treatment strategies that could prove far more precise and effective than traditional therapies. Mitochondrial Mysteries Transform Treatment Paradigms The discussion highlights how Dr. Cohen's team uncovered widespread disturbances in cellular energy metabolism underlying major psychiatric conditions. These findings have far-reaching potential for designing targeted treatments that could benefit people in many regions and populations. His studies show that brain cells created from individuals with schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, or Alzheimer disease display intrinsic metabolic defects that may be corrected even before symptoms emerge. This energy-based framework challenges decades of conventional thinking centered on neurotransmitter imbalance. Dr. Cohen explains that the brain relies more than any other organ on finely tuned energy production and communication between cells. His results suggest that restoring these fundamental cellular functions could help prevent or ease symptoms in vulnerable individuals worldwide, independent of background or environment. By combining genomic analysis, advanced brain imaging, and cellular modeling, Dr. Cohen promotes a multidisciplinary approach to mental health research. This integration provides scientists with a powerful model for exploring complex brain disorders -- especially mood, psychotic, and cognitive conditions -- that appear across cultures and regions. Challenging Century-Old Diagnostic Models Instead of the status quo expert-consensus diagnostic systems, that place people in categories, Dr. Cohen advocates implementation of an evidence-based dimensional approach for describing patients. He argues that terms like ""schizophrenia"" should be retired in favor of scientifically accurate alternatives that reduce stigma while better capturing illness complexity. His proposed dimensional model focuses on symptom profiles rather than categorical labels, offering clinicians more nuanced tools for patient assessment and treatment planning. This diagnostic revolution extends beyond mere terminology. Dr. Cohen's research demonstrates that traditional categorical systems fail to reflect underlying biological realities or clinical presentations adequately. His dimensional approach aligns with how clinicians actually evaluate patients, globally, providing richer individual descriptions while enabling formation of more homogeneous research cohorts. Such reforms could transform psychiatric practice internationally, improving diagnostic precision and treatment outcomes across diverse healthcare systems. The interview explores how these new models could particularly benefit regions where Western diagnostic frameworks have proven problematic. By emphasizing observable symptoms and illness trajectories rather than culturally bound categories, dimensional approaches offer universal applicability while respecting local contexts and experiences. From Laboratory Bench to Hospital Leadership Dr. Cohen's impact extends beyond research laboratories. As McLean Hospital President and Psychiatrist-in -Chief from 1997 to 2005, he reversed financial decline while establishing over 30 new programs advancing both clinical care and scientific investigation. His leadership philosophy emphasized supporting frontline staff and reducing bureaucracy, principles applicable to healthcare institutions worldwide facing similar challenges. Under his guidance, McLean achieved record levels of patient care, research funding, and educational training. These accomplishments demonstrate how scientific rigor combined with compassionate leadership can transform struggling institutions into thriving centers of excellence. His experience offers valuable lessons for hospital administrators globally confronting resource constraints while striving to maintain quality care and research productivity. Particularly noteworthy was his establishment of Waverley Place, a peer-run center supporting individuals with mental illness living in communities. This innovative model, prioritizing mission over revenue generation, demonstrates how psychiatric institutions can serve broader societal needs while maintaining financial viability. Personal Journey Shapes Scientific Vision The interview offers a window into the personal experiences that guided Dr. Cohen's path as a scientist. His fascination with physics and mathematics in his youth, combined with meaningful interactions with psychiatric patients during medical training, helped shape his approach to research and care. He recalls his first psychiatric patient, a young woman whose remarkable recovery through medication left a lasting impression and underscored psychiatry's power to rebuild lives affected by mental illness. Dr. Cohen also speaks candidly about the anxiety and shyness that sometimes limited his professional opportunities. His openness about these challenges offers a rare glimpse of vulnerability in a leading researcher. By sharing these reflections, he highlights that perseverance and commitment, rather than the absence of difficulty, are what truly define scientific achievement. His honesty serves as encouragement for young scientists who may encounter similar obstacles. Family plays a central role in his story. His father, a respected internist, modeled a deep sense of medical dedication and the value of collaboration in research. Having been married for more than 55 years, Dr. Cohen credits his family's steady support as a cornerstone of his long and productive career. Together, these elements reveal how great science often grows from human connections and experiences that extend far beyond the laboratory. Future Directions and Global Impact Looking ahead, Dr. Cohen expresses optimism about the future of psychiatric research while recognizing the societal hurdles that remain. His current work aims to identify specific biological mechanisms that influence vulnerability to mental illness, with a strong focus on prevention. Because psychotic disorders usually do not appear before adolescence and dementia tends to develop later in life, he believes early interventions are becoming increasingly achievable. The discussion emphasizes how new technologies, particularly in cellular reprogramming and genomic analysis, are transforming what researchers can uncover about the origins of psychiatric disease. These methods, now more widely available thanks to international initiatives (including those supported by Genomic Press), are accelerating discoveries and opening the door to more effective treatments. Dr. Cohen also stresses the need to nurture creativity and risk-taking in science, cautioning against the tendency to fund only predictable or incremental research. He envisions a global scientific community where innovation can flourish in any country or institution, free from hierarchy or limitation. This philosophy aligns with the open-access approach advanced by Genomic Press, ensuring that important findings can be shared broadly without financial barriers, promoting a truly inclusive and collaborative model of discovery.",https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/10/251014014304.htm,Science,BBC,,https://www.sciencedaily.com/images/1920/blue-light-glowing-mitochondria.webp,,eb3d1b9bdd4c988bd53fd1732ab5d72eab5578a2
7a5fe057aa6c,Popular hair-loss pill linked to depression and suicide,today&amp;#039;s healthcare; mental health research; diseases and conditions; diet and weight loss; mental health; depression; psychiatry; dieting and weight control,"A new analysis by a public health expert at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem has found that finasteride, a widely used treatment for hair loss, has been associated with depression and suicide for more than twenty years. Despite these long-standing concerns, neither regulators nor the drug's manufacturer took meaningful action. Drawing on adverse event reports and health records from several countries, the review identifies a consistent pattern of psychiatric side effects linked to the drug. Even with growing evidence, both Merck and the FDA failed to launch necessary safety investigations. The author is now urging major reforms to the way medications are approved and monitored for long-term risks. For more than two decades, finasteride has been prescribed to millions of men seeking to slow or reverse hair loss. Behind its cosmetic appeal, however, evidence has continued to emerge suggesting serious mental health consequences, including depression, anxiety, and in some cases, suicide. Prof. Mayer Brezis of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem argues that both the medical community and regulators have repeatedly failed to protect the public by overlooking signs of psychiatric harm associated with the drug. His review analyzed data from eight large studies published between 2017 and 2023. The findings show a clear trend: people who used finasteride were far more likely to experience mood disorders and suicidal thoughts than those who did not. This pattern appeared consistently across various national databases, including the FDA's adverse event system and healthcare records from Sweden, Canada, and Israel. ""The evidence is no longer anecdotal,"" said Prof. Brezis, a professor emeritus of medicine and public health. ""We now see consistent patterns across diverse populations. And the consequences may have been tragic."" The report estimates that hundreds of thousands of users may have suffered from finasteride-related depression, and that hundreds -- possibly more -- may have died by suicide. Originally approved by the FDA in 1997 for male pattern baldness, the drug has remained popular for its perceived safety and effectiveness, particularly among younger men. Critics say, however, that its risks were downplayed or ignored. A Delayed Response, With a High Cost Although the FDA recognized depression as a possible side effect in 2011 and added suicidal thoughts to the label in 2022, researchers had been warning of potential dangers as early as 2002. Internal FDA files from 2010, cited in Brezis' review, contained entire sections redacted as ""confidential,"" including estimates of how many people might have been affected. By 2011, only 18 suicides linked to finasteride had been reported to the FDA. Based on worldwide usage, Brezis concluded the actual number should have been in the thousands. ""It wasn't just underreporting,"" Dr. Brezis wrote. ""It was a systemic failure of pharmacovigilance."" Unlike drugs used to treat obesity or psychiatric disorders, which are often closely monitored after approval, finasteride's classification as a cosmetic treatment may have shielded it from deeper scrutiny. None of the data-mining studies referenced in the review were initiated by Merck, the company that developed the drug, nor were they commissioned by regulatory authorities. A Cosmetic Drug With Life-Altering Risks Brezis argues the drug's classification as a non-essential, appearance-enhancing medication changes the risk calculus. ""This wasn't about life or death medical necessity,"" he said. ""This was about hair."" The biological rationale is clear. Finasteride works by blocking the conversion of testosterone into dihydrotestosterone (DHT), but in doing so, it may also disrupt neurosteroids like allopregnanolone -- linked to mood regulation in the brain. Animal studies have shown long-term effects on neuroinflammation and even changes in hippocampal structure. For some patients, the consequences don't end when the pills do. Reports of lingering symptoms -- dubbed ""post-finasteride syndrome"" -- include insomnia, panic attacks, cognitive dysfunction, and suicidal thoughts that persist months or even years after stopping treatment. Regulatory Gaps, Corporate Silence The report is especially scathing toward the FDA and Merck. Despite having access to millions of patient records and robust pharmacovigilance tools, neither party acted in time, Brezis argues. The industry's silence was strategic, he suggests, driven by market pressures and legal liability -- echoing past controversies like Merck's handling of Vioxx. ""Nothing is more important to Organon than the safety of our medicines,"" the company recently claimed in a public statement. Yet none of the safety studies cited were initiated by the manufacturer. The FDA, meanwhile, took five years to respond to a citizen petition calling for a black-box warning. Its final decision? To add suicidal ideation to the label -- but not as a formal warning. What Now? Brezis is calling for immediate changes in how drugs like finasteride are approved, monitored, and prescribed. His recommendations include suspending marketing of the drug for cosmetic purposes until safety is re-established, mandatory post-approval studies with strict enforcement, and systematic recording of drug histories in suicide investigations. ""For many, those changes come too late. The paper is dedicated to one such individual -- a previously healthy man who took finasteride ""just"" to improve his hair. Within days, he spiraled into severe psychiatric distress. He never recovered. Months later, he took his own life.""",https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/10/251013040343.htm,Science,BBC,,https://www.sciencedaily.com/images/1920/depressed-man-balding-mental-health.webp,,97cda837d803a812ced03dfc566da6eef4f72a8b
2143006b3f57,Scientists build artificial neurons that work like real ones,illegal drugs; neuroscience; psychology; creativity; computers and internet; hacking; encryption; computer modeling,"Engineers at the University of Massachusetts Amherst have developed an artificial neuron whose electrical activity closely matches that of natural brain cells. The innovation builds on the team's earlier research using protein nanowires made from electricity-producing bacteria. This new approach could pave the way for computers that run with the efficiency of living systems and may even connect directly with biological tissue. ""Our brain processes an enormous amount of data,"" says Shuai Fu, a graduate student in electrical and computer engineering at UMass Amherst and lead author of the study published in Nature Communications . ""But its power usage is very, very low, especially compared to the amount of electricity it takes to run a Large Language Model, like ChatGPT."" The human body operates with remarkable electrical efficiency -- more than 100 times greater than that of a typical computer circuit. The brain alone contains billions of neurons, specialized cells that send and receive electrical signals throughout the body. Performing a task such as writing a story uses only about 20 watts of power in the human brain, whereas a large language model can require more than a megawatt to accomplish the same thing. Engineers have long sought to design artificial neurons for more energy-efficient computing, but reducing their voltage to match biological levels has been a major obstacle. ""Previous versions of artificial neurons used 10 times more voltage -- and 100 times more power -- than the one we have created,"" says Jun Yao, associate professor of electrical and computer engineering at UMass Amherst and the paper's senior author. Because of this, earlier designs were far less efficient and couldn't connect directly with living neurons, which are sensitive to stronger electrical signals. ""Ours register only 0.1 volts, which about the same as the neurons in our bodies,"" says Yao. There are a wide range of applications for Fu and Yao's new neuron, from redesigning computers along bio-inspired, and far more efficient principles, to electronic devices that could speak to our bodies directly. ""We currently have all kinds of wearable electronic sensing systems,"" says Yao, ""but they are comparatively clunky and inefficient. Every time they sense a signal from our body, they have to electrically amplify it so that a computer can analyze it. That intermediate step of amplification increases both power consumption and the circuit's complexity, but sensors built with our low-voltage neurons could do without any amplification at all."" The secret ingredient in the team's new low-powered neuron is a protein nanowire synthesized from the remarkable bacteria Geobacter sulfurreducens , which also has the superpower of producing electricity. Yao, along with various colleagues, have used the bacteria's protein nanowires to design a whole host of extraordinary efficient devices: a biofilm, powered by sweat, that can power personal electronics; an ""electronic nose"" that can sniff out disease; and a device, which can be built of nearly anything, that can harvest electricity from thin air itself.

This simple idea forms the basis of Bayes' rule, a mathematical approach to calculating probabilities first introduced in 1763. Now, an international group of scientists has demonstrated how Bayes' rule can also apply in the quantum realm. ""I would say it is a breakthrough in mathematical physics,"" said Professor Valerio Scarani, Deputy Director and Principal Investigator at the Centre for Quantum Technologies, and member of the team. His co-authors on the work published on 28 August 2025 in Physical Review Letters are Assistant Professor Ge Bai at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology in China, and Professor Francesco Buscemi at Nagoya University in Japan. ""Bayes' rule has been helping us make smarter guesses for 250 years. Now we have taught it some quantum tricks,"" said Prof Buscemi. Although other researchers had previously suggested quantum versions of Bayes' rule, this team is the first to derive a true quantum Bayes' rule based on a core physical principle. Conditional probability Bayes' rule takes its name from Thomas Bayes, who described his method for calculating conditional probabilities in ""An Essay Towards Solving a Problem in the Doctrine of Chances."" Imagine someone who tests positive for the flu. They might have suspected illness already, but this new result changes their assessment of the situation. Bayes' rule provides a systematic way to update that belief, factoring in the likelihood of the test being wrong as well as the person's prior assumptions. The rule treats probabilities as measures of belief rather than absolute facts. This interpretation has sparked debate among statisticians, with some arguing that probability should represent objective frequency rather than subjective confidence. Still, when uncertainty and belief play a role, Bayes' rule is widely recognized as a rational framework for decision-making. It underpins countless applications today, from medical testing and weather forecasting to data science and machine learning. Principle of minimum change When calculating probabilities with Bayes' rule, the principle of minimum change is obeyed. Mathematically, the principle of minimum change minimizes the distance between the joint probability distributions of the initial and updated belief. Intuitively, this is the idea that for any new piece of information, beliefs are updated in the smallest possible way that is compatible with the new facts. In the case of the flu test, for example, a negative test would not imply that the person is healthy, but rather that they are less likely to have the flu. In their work, Prof Scarani, who is also from NUS Department of Physics, Asst Prof Bai, and Prof Buscemi began with a quantum analogue to the minimum change principle. They quantified change in terms of quantum fidelity, which is a measure of the closeness between quantum states. Researchers always thought a quantum Bayes' rule should exist because quantum states define probabilities. For example, the quantum state of a particle provides the probability of it being found at different locations. The goal is to determine the whole quantum state, but the particle is only found at one location when a measurement is performed. This new information will then update the belief, boosting the probability around that location. The team derived their quantum Bayes' rule by maximizing the fidelity between two objects that represent the forward and the reverse process, in analogy with a classical joint probability distribution. Maximizing fidelity is equivalent to minimizing change. They found in some cases their equations matched the Petz recovery map, which was proposed by Dénes Petz in the 1980s and was later identified as one of the most likely candidates for the quantum Bayes' rule based just on its properties. ""This is the first time we have derived it from a higher principle, which could be a validation for using the Petz map,"" said Prof Scarani. The Petz map has potential applications in quantum computing for tasks such as quantum error correction and machine learning. The team plans to explore whether applying the minimum change principle to other quantum measures might reveal other solutions.",https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/10/251013040333.htm,Science,BBC,,https://www.sciencedaily.com/images/1920/quantum-particle-physics-abstract-light-beams.webp,,0b511bec5b948ce40a4c59431c4c5c28e2213d46
5ab7ea89db22,Your skin could warn of hidden mental health trouble,heart disease; mental health research; diseases and conditions; personalized medicine; mental health; depression; psychiatry; disorders and syndromes,"Scientists have found that people receiving treatment for mental health conditions who also have skin problems may face a higher risk of severe outcomes, including depression and suicidal thoughts. The research, which could help doctors better identify vulnerable patients and tailor psychiatric care, was presented at the ECNP meeting in Amsterdam. The study involved 481 individuals experiencing their first episode of psychosis (the first time a person has symptoms such as delusions, hallucinations, or losing touch with reality). Among them, 14.5% showed signs of skin issues (24% of females and 9.8% of males), including rashes, itching, or sensitivity to light. All participants received four weeks of antipsychotic treatment, after which researchers assessed various mental health indicators. Lead researcher Dr. Joaquín Galvañ (Instituto de Investigación Sanitaria Gregorio Marañón, Madrid) explained: ""After 4 weeks of follow-up, patients with a first episode of psychosis presenting with skin conditions experienced higher levels of depression and risk of suicide. We found that just 7% of the patients without the initial skin conditions had suicidal thoughts or attempts, in contrast, around 25% of the patients with initial skin conditions had suicidal thoughts or attempts. Initial skin conditions are also linked to greater depression and poorer well-being at follow-up. ""This discovery suggests that the presence of skin conditions indicates that these patients are more at risk for worse outcomes than patients who do not have skin conditions after a first episode of psychosis."" The team noted that, if further research supports these results, skin symptoms could serve as an early warning sign for elevated mental health risks, much like how blood tests can signal the likelihood of cancer or heart disease. Because both the brain and skin develop from the same embryonic layer called the ectoderm, the scientists set out to explore how these two systems might be connected. Dr. Galvañ added: ""It was already known that between 30% and 60% of people with skin conditions show psychiatric symptoms. What we have done is look at things from the opposite direction; do people with mental health problems have skin conditions, and if so, can this tell us anything useful? Our findings suggest that dermatological symptoms may represent a marker of illness severity and poor short-term outcomes in the early stages of psychosis, potentially identifying a subgroup of patients with a poorer clinical prognosis who may benefit from early tailored interventions. The reason for the connection is still unclear, but our working hypothesis is that this may be due to the skin and neurological systems having common developmental origins and inflammatory pathways; but this needs to be confirmed. As far as we know this is the first study to show this link in patients with psychosis, so we need follow-up studies to confirm the finding. We also need to understand if this link applies also to a range of other psychiatric conditions, such as bipolar disorder, ADHD, anxiety or depression."" Offering an independent perspective, Professor Eric Ruhe (Professor of Difficult-to-Treat Depression at Radboud University, the Netherlands) commented: ""This is an interesting association between skin problems and a first episode of psychosis. These results need replication in different cohorts but might indeed show a new link between skin and psychopathology. As the skin and the brain derive from the same embryonic origin, this would worth pursuing further, both diagnostically and mechanistically (which may be more interesting). For example, this association might be used to culture skin cells to begin to understand which treatment is appropriate."" This is an independent comment, Professor Ruhe was not involved in this work.",https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/10/251013040328.htm,Science,BBC,,https://www.sciencedaily.com/images/1920/asian-woman-scratching-itchy-skin-hand.webp,,93412b5ad93a9768ac61fd9ddb9d729f2c1e20c2
9e75ab9f5943,This experimental “super vaccine” stopped cancer cold in the lab,lung disease; lung cancer; pharmacology; diseases and conditions; pharmaceuticals; influenza; today&amp;#039;s healthcare; cold and flu,"Researchers at the University of Massachusetts Amherst have shown that their nanoparticle-based vaccine can successfully prevent several aggressive cancers in mice, including melanoma, pancreatic cancer, and triple-negative breast cancer. Depending on the cancer type, up to 88% of vaccinated mice stayed tumor-free (depending on the cancer), and the vaccine also reduced -- and in some cases completely prevented -- the spread of cancer throughout the body. ""By engineering these nanoparticles to activate the immune system via multi-pathway activation that combines with cancer-specific antigens, we can prevent tumor growth with remarkable survival rates,"" says Prabhani Atukorale, assistant professor of biomedical engineering in the Riccio College of Engineering at UMass Amherst and corresponding author on the paper. Atukorale had previously shown that her nanoparticle-based drug design could shrink or eliminate tumors in mice. The new findings reveal that this approach can also prevent cancer from forming in the first place. In the first experiment, her team combined the nanoparticle system with well-studied melanoma peptides (called an antigen, similar to how a flu shot typically contains parts of the inactivated flu virus). This formulation activated immune cells known as T cells, training them to detect and destroy melanoma cells. Three weeks later, the vaccinated mice were exposed to melanoma. Eighty percent of the mice that received the ""super adjuvant"" nanoparticle vaccine remained tumor-free and survived the entire study period (250 days). In contrast, all of the mice that received traditional vaccines, non-nanoparticle formulations, or no vaccine at all developed tumors and died within 35 days. The vaccine also stopped cancer from spreading to the lungs. When the mice were systemically exposed to melanoma cells to mimic metastasis, none of the nanoparticle-vaccinated mice developed lung tumors, while every other mouse did. ""Metastases across the board is the highest hurdle for cancer,"" says Atukorale. ""The vast majority of tumor mortality is still due to metastases, and it almost trumps us working in difficult-to-reach cancers, such as melanoma and pancreatic cancer."" Atukorale refers to this protection as ""memory immunity."" ""That is a real advantage of immunotherapy, because memory is not only sustained locally,"" she explains. ""We have memory systemically, which is very important. The immune system spans the entire geography of the body."" The first phase of testing used a vaccine with known antigens designed for melanoma. However, creating antigens for each cancer type can require extensive genome sequencing or bioinformatics analysis. To simplify the process, the researchers tested a second version using killed tumor cells, called tumor lysate, derived directly from the cancer itself. Mice vaccinated with this nanoparticle lysate vaccine were later exposed to melanoma, pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, or triple-negative breast cancer cells. The results were impressive: 88% of mice with pancreatic cancer, 75% with breast cancer, and 69% with melanoma rejected tumor formation. Furthermore, all mice that remained tumor-free after vaccination also resisted metastasis when exposed systemically to cancer cells. ""The tumor-specific T-cell responses that we are able to generate -- that is really the key behind the survival benefit,"" says Griffin Kane, postdoctoral research associate at UMass Amherst and first author on the paper. ""There is really intense immune activation when you treat innate immune cells with this formulation, which triggers these cells to present antigens and prime tumor-killing T cells."" This robust T-cell response is possible because of the particular nanoparticle design of the vaccine. Vaccines -- regardless the target disease -- contain two primary components: The antigen and the adjuvant. The antigen is the piece of the disease-causing pathogen (in this study, cancer cells) that the immune system can be trained to target. The adjuvant is a substance that activates the immune system to recognize the antigen, treat it as a foreign intruder and eliminate it. The Atukorale Lab draws inspiration from how pathogens naturally stimulate the immune system. To mount a strong immune response, the body requires multiple ""danger"" signals triggered through different pathways. ""In recent years, we have come to understand how important the selection of the adjuvant is because it drives the second signal that is needed for the correct priming of T and B cells,"" says Atukorale. However, just like oil and water, many of the most promising adjuvants for cancer immunotherapy do not mix well at the molecular level. To overcome this, the Atukorale Lab has engineered a lipid nanoparticle-based ""super adjuvant"" capable of stably encapsulating and co-delivering two distinct immune adjuvants that activate immunity in a coordinated, synergistic way. The researchers say that their design offers a platform approach that could be used across multiple cancer types. The researchers envision that this platform can be applied to create both therapeutic and preventative regimens, particularly for individuals at high risk for cancer. This is an idea that Atukorale and Kane have turned into a startup called NanoVax Therapeutics. ""The real core technology that our company has been founded on is this nanoparticle and this treatment approach,"" says Kane. ""This is a platform that Prabhani developed. The startup lets us pursue these translational efforts with the ultimate goal of improving patients' lives."" Next, Atukorale and Kane plan to extend this technology to a therapeutic vaccine and have already taken the initial de-risking steps in translation.

This new AI just found it,computer modeling; computers and internet; artificial intelligence; markets and finance; environmental policies; stem education; retail and services; security and defense,"Most scientific data never reach their full potential to drive new discoveries. Out of every 100 datasets produced, about 80 stay within the lab, 20 are shared but seldom reused, fewer than two meet FAIR standards, and only one typically leads to new findings. The consequences are significant: slower progress in cancer treatment, climate models that lack sufficient evidence, and studies that cannot be replicated. To change this, the open-science publisher Frontiers has introduced Frontiers FAIR² Data Management, described as the world's first comprehensive, AI-powered research data service. It is designed to make data both reusable and properly credited by combining all essential steps -- curation, compliance checks, AI-ready formatting, peer review, an interactive portal, certification, and permanent hosting -- into one seamless process. The goal is to ensure that today's research investments translate into faster advances in health, sustainability, and technology. FAIR² builds on the FAIR principles (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable) with an expanded open framework that guarantees every dataset is AI-compatible and ethically reusable by both humans and machines. The FAIR² Data Management system is the first working implementation of this model, arriving at a moment when research output is growing rapidly and artificial intelligence is reshaping how discoveries are made. It turns high-level principles into real, scalable infrastructure with measurable impact. Dr. Kamila Markram, co-founder and CEO of Frontiers, explains: ""Ninety percent of science vanishes into the void. With Frontiers FAIR² Data Management, no dataset and no discovery need ever be lost again -- every contribution can now fuel progress, earn the credit it deserves, and unleash science."" AI at the Core Work that once required months of manual effort -- from organizing and verifying datasets to generating metadata and publishable outputs -- is now completed in minutes by the AI Data Steward, powered by Senscience, the Frontiers venture behind FAIR². Researchers who submit their data receive four integrated outputs: a certified Data Package, a peer-reviewed and citable Data Article, an Interactive Data Portal featuring visualizations and AI chat, and a FAIR² Certificate. Each element includes quality controls and clear summaries that make the data easier to understand for general users and more compatible across research disciplines. Together, these outputs ensure that every dataset is preserved, validated, citable, and reusable, helping accelerate discovery while giving researchers proper recognition. Frontiers FAIR² also enhances visibility and accessibility, supporting responsible reuse by scientists, policymakers, practitioners, communities, and even AI systems, allowing society to extract greater value from its investment in science.

It offers a powerful resource for pandemic preparedness, enabling deeper understanding of variant behavior and fitness. Preclinical Brain Injury MRI -- A harmonized dataset of 343 diffusion MRI scans from four research centers, standardized across protocols and aligned for comparability. It supports reproducible biomarker discovery, robust cross-site analysis, and advances in preclinical traumatic brain injury research. Environmental Pressure Indicators (1990-2050) -- Combining observed data and modeled forecasts across 43 countries over six decades, this dataset tracks emissions, waste, population, and GDP. It underpins sustainability benchmarking and evidence-based climate policy planning. Indo-Pacific Atoll Biodiversity -- Spanning 280 atolls across five regions, this dataset integrates biodiversity records, reef habitats, climate indicators, and human-use histories. It provides an unprecedented basis for ecological modeling, conservation prioritization, and cross-regional research on vulnerable island ecosystems. Researchers testing the pilots noted that Frontiers FAIR² not only preserves and shares data but also builds confidence in its reuse -- through quality checks, clear summaries for non-specialists, and the reliability to combine datasets across disciplines, all while ensuring scientists receive credit. All pilot datasets comply with the FAIR² Open Specification, making them responsibly curated, reusable, and trusted for long-term human and machine use so today's data can accelerate tomorrow's solutions to society's most pressing challenges. Recognition and Reuse Each reuse multiplies the value of the original dataset, ensuring that no discovery is wasted, every contribution can spark the next breakthrough, and researchers gain recognition for their work.

82cd1286b2b2,California’s next big one could be faster and far more destructive,earthquakes; natural disasters; air quality; environmental science; severe weather; earth science; pollution; tsunamis,"Researchers from the Statewide California Earthquake Center at USC Dornsife are warning that extremely fast and powerful earthquakes could strike California and are calling for tougher building standards and improved fault monitoring. Most residents of the state are accustomed to the idea of earthquakes, but scientists say a particularly dangerous type has been largely ignored: ""supershear"" earthquakes that move so quickly they overtake their own seismic waves. In an opinion article in Seismological Research Letters , experts from the USC Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences explained that these rare events cause far stronger shaking across a wider region than typical quakes. They argue that California needs to strengthen its hazard planning and update building codes to address the greater potential for destruction. ""While California is no more likely to have supershear earthquakes than other, similar regions with large fault systems like the San Andreas, the threat has gone unnoticed for too long,"" said Yehuda Ben-Zion, professor of Earth sciences and director of the Statewide California Earthquake Center (SCEC), based at USC Dornsife. ""The frequency of these supershear ruptures has been greatly underappreciated."" Scientists describe supershear earthquakes as being similar to sonic booms. When a jet surpasses the speed of sound, it produces a shock wave in the air. Likewise, when a supershear rupture travels faster than seismic shear waves, it creates powerful ground shock fronts, said Ahmed Elbanna, professor of Earth sciences and director-designate of SCEC. ""It breaks the shear wave speed barrier in the rocks and produces destructive waves that are stronger than what's generated by a normal earthquake,"" he said. This added energy can cause severe damage. Supershear quakes send intense shaking farther from the epicenter and strike twice, according to Elbanna -- a sharp initial blow from the shock front followed by the trailing waves. Globally, about one in three major strike-slip earthquakes are supershear. This is especially significant for California, where many faults near large cities are strike-slip and capable of producing magnitude 7 or higher events. ""We cannot say exactly when and where the next earthquake will be and which one will be supershear,"" Ben-Zion said, ""but we can say with certainty that over the next few decades, we will have multiple magnitude 7 earthquakes in California. ""They are coming, whether we are prepared or not,"" he added. The authors warn that current design standards don't fully account for a supershear quake's extra punch. Buildings and infrastructure are generally engineered for the strongest shaking perpendicular to faults, but supershear quakes direct their energy along the fault line itself. ""Critical structures should be built to this higher standard, and so far, they are not,"" Ben-Zion said. To prepare, the team calls for denser monitoring near major faults, advanced computer simulations of supershear scenarios, and stronger building codes. ""This is a collaborative effort where everybody has to chip in,"" Elbanna said. ""And I think here at USC and SCEC, with their reputation in the community, this is the right time and right place to get this effort started.""

a36e712e991f,Decades-old photosynthesis mystery finally solved,new species; biotechnology and bioengineering; endangered plants; nature; energy and resources; engineering and construction; physics; organic chemistry,"Scientists from the Indian Institute of Science (IISc) and the California Institute of Technology (Caltech) have finally solved a long-standing puzzle about the earliest moments of photosynthesis -- the vital process through which plants, algae, and certain bacteria capture sunlight to generate oxygen and energy-rich compounds. Their research reveals why the first movements of electrons, which are crucial for transferring energy, occur through only one side of a key protein-pigment structure. The findings were published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences . Photosynthesis is a sequence of reactions in which electrons pass between multiple pigment molecules. Although it has been examined for decades, the process remains difficult to fully explain because it involves numerous intricate components, operates at extremely fast timescales, and varies slightly across different species. Gaining a deeper understanding of these steps could help scientists develop efficient artificial systems, such as synthetic leaves and solar-based fuel technologies, that replicate nature's design. In most life forms that use photosynthesis, the process begins with a protein-pigment complex known as Photosystem II (PSII). This complex captures sunlight and splits water molecules, releasing oxygen and sending electrons onward to other molecules in the chain of energy transfer. PSII contains two nearly identical branches, known as D1 and D2, surrounded by four chlorophyll molecules and two related pigments called pheophytins. These are symmetrically arranged and connected to electron carriers known as plastoquinones. In theory, electrons should move from chlorophyll to pheophytin and then to plastoquinone along both branches. However, experiments have consistently shown that electrons move only through the D1 branch -- a finding that has baffled scientists for years. ""Despite the structural symmetry between the D1 and D2 protein branches in PSII, only the D1 branch is functionally active,"" explains Aditya Kumar Mandal, the study's first author and a PhD student in the Department of Physics at IISc. To investigate this imbalance, the team combined molecular dynamics simulations, quantum mechanical analyses, and Marcus theory (a Nobel Prize-winning model that describes how electrons are transferred) to chart the energy patterns in both pathways. ""We assessed the electron transfer efficiency step-by-step through both D1 and D2 branches,"" says Shubham Basera, PhD student in the Department of Physics and one of the authors. The team found that the D2 branch has a much higher energy barrier, which makes electron transport energetically unfavourable. Specifically, the transfer of electrons from pheophytin to plastoquinone in D2 requires twice as much activation energy as D1 -- a barrier that electrons seem unable to overcome, preventing energy from flowing forward. The researchers also simulated the current-voltage characteristics of both branches and found that the resistance against electron movement in D2 was two orders of magnitude higher than that in D1. The asymmetry in electron flow may also be influenced by subtle differences in the protein environment around the PSII and how the pigments are embedded in it, the researchers suggest. For example, the chlorophyll pigment in D1 has an excitation state at a lower energy than its D2 counterpart, suggesting that the D1 pigment has a better chance of attracting and transferring electrons. The researchers also suggest that tweaking some of these components can boost or rewire electron flow across PSII. For example, swapping chlorophyll and pheophytin in D2 could overcome the electron block, because chlorophyll needs lower activation energy than pheophytin. ""Our research presents a significant step forward in understanding natural photosynthesis,"" says Prabal K Maiti, Professor at the Department of Physics and one of the corresponding authors of the study. ""These findings may help design efficient artificial photosynthetic systems capable of converting solar energy into chemical fuels, contributing to innovative and sustainable renewable energy solutions.""

f3b967eb123d,An interstellar visitor lights up the Red Planet’s sky,"space exploration; space telescopes; nasa; asteroids, comets and meteors; jupiter; galaxies; space missions; cosmology","Between October 1 and 7, ESA's ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter (TGO) and Mars Express spacecraft turned their instruments toward interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS as it passed near Mars. Of all ESA spacecraft, the two Mars orbiters had the best view of this rare visitor. During its closest approach to the Red Planet on October 3, the comet was about 30 million km away. Both orbiters used their onboard cameras to track the comet's motion. These instruments are typically designed to capture Mars's bright surface from just a few hundred to a few thousand kilometers above it, so observing such a faint object at such a great distance presented a major challenge. ExoMars TGO successfully recorded a series of images using its Colour and Stereo Surface Imaging System (CaSSIS). In the animation below, comet 3I/ATLAS appears as a faint white spot drifting downward near the center. That small blur marks the heart of the comet, made up of its icy, rocky nucleus surrounded by a glowing cloud called the coma. Because the comet was so distant, CaSSIS could not separate the nucleus from the coma. Detecting the nucleus itself would have been like trying to spot a mobile phone on the Moon from Earth. The coma, however, is clearly visible. Stretching several thousand kilometers across, it forms as sunlight warms the comet, releasing gas and dust that collect into a hazy halo around the core. CaSSIS could not measure the coma's full extent because its brightness fades rapidly with distance from the nucleus, eventually disappearing into background noise. Usually, gas and dust from the coma stream away to create a long tail that can stretch for millions of kilometers as the comet nears the Sun. The tail is much dimmer than the coma, so it does not appear in the current images, but it could become visible in future observations as 3I/ATLAS heats up and sheds more ice. Nick Thomas, Principal Investigator of the CaSSIS camera, said, ""This was a very challenging observation for the instrument. The comet is around 10,000 to 100,000 times fainter than our usual target. The work continues So far, 3I/ATLAS has not been detected in the Mars Express images. One reason is that Mars Express can only take exposures of up to 0.5 seconds (its maximum limit), while ExoMars TGO was able to use five-second exposures. Researchers are continuing to process the data from both orbiters. They plan to combine multiple Mars Express images to enhance the faint signal and improve their chances of detecting the comet. The teams also attempted to study the comet's light spectrum using the OMEGA and SPICAM spectrometers on Mars Express and the NOMAD instrument on ExoMars TGO. It remains uncertain whether the coma and tail were bright enough to allow scientists to identify the comet's chemical composition. Over the coming weeks and months, researchers will keep analyzing the data to learn more about the materials that make up 3I/ATLAS and how it changes as it draws closer to the Sun. Colin Wilson, Mars Express and ExoMars project scientist at ESA, said: ""Though our Mars orbiters continue to make impressive contributions to Mars science, it's always extra exciting to see them responding to unexpected situations like this one. I look forward to seeing what the data reveals following further analysis."" A rare visitor Originating from outside our Solar System, comet 3I/ATLAS is only the third interstellar comet ever seen, following 1I/ʻOumuamua in 2017 and 2I/Borisov in 2019. These comets are absolutely foreign. Every planet, moon, asteroid, comet and lifeform in our Solar System share a common origin. But interstellar comets are true outsiders, carrying clues about the formation of worlds far beyond our own. Comet 3I/ATLAS was first spotted on July 1, 2025, by the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) telescope in Río Hurtado, Chile. Since then, astronomers have used ground-based and space telescopes to monitor its progress and discover more about it. Based on its trajectory, astronomers suspect that 3I/ATLAS could be the oldest comet ever observed. It may be three billion years older than the Solar System, which is itself already 4.6 billion years old. What's next? Next month, we will observe the comet with our Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer (Juice). Though Juice will be further from 3I/ATLAS than our Mars orbiters were last week, it will see the comet just after its closest approach to the Sun, meaning that it will be in a more active state. We don't expect to receive data from Juice's observations until February 2026 -- find out why in our FAQs. Icy wanderers such as 3I/ATLAS offer a rare, tangible connection to the broader galaxy. To actually visit one would connect humankind with the Universe on a far greater scale. To this end, ESA is preparing the Comet Interceptor mission. Comet Interceptor is due to launch in 2029 into a parking orbit, from where it will lie in wait for a suitable target -- a pristine comet from the distant Oort Cloud that surrounds our Solar System, or, unlikely but highly appealing, an interstellar object like 3I/ATLAS. Michael Kueppers, Comet Interceptor project scientist expands: ""When Comet Interceptor was selected in 2019, we only knew of one interstellar object -- 1I/ʻOumuamua, discovered in 2017. Since then, two more such objects have been discovered, showing large diversity in their appearance. Visiting one could provide a breakthrough in understanding their nature."" While it remains improbable that we will discover an interstellar object that is reachable for Comet Interceptor, as a first demonstration of a rapid response mission that waits in space for its target, it will be a pathfinder for possible future missions to intercept these mysterious visitors.",https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/10/251012054618.htm,Science,BBC,,https://www.sciencedaily.com/images/1920/exomars-trace-gas-orbiter-observes-comet-3iatlas.webp,,ce0a955fffaf6ed36469003cbb252da96db9dc88
728921b18374,Ancient humans in Italy butchered elephants and made tools from their bones,animals; biotechnology and bioengineering; genetically modified; ancient civilizations; fossils; cultures; resource shortage; public health; ocean policy,"During a warmer stretch of the Middle Pleistocene, early humans living in what is now Italy regularly butchered elephants for both food and usable materials, according to a study published October 8, 2025, in the open-access journal PLOS One by Beniamino Mecozzi of Sapienza University of Rome (Italy) and his research team. Early humans often relied on animal carcasses for meat and tools, but clear evidence of such activities is rare and challenging to interpret in the archaeological record. In this new analysis, Mecozzi and his colleagues examined the remains of an elephant found at the Casal Lumbroso site in northwest Rome. By comparing surrounding layers of ash, they determined that the remains date back roughly 404,000 years to a notably warm phase of the Middle Pleistocene Epoch. At the site, researchers uncovered more than 300 skeletal fragments belonging to a single straight-tusked elephant, Palaeoloxodon , along with over 500 stone tools. Many bones showed fresh fractures caused by blunt impacts soon after the elephant's death, indicating deliberate breakage. The absence of visible cut marks suggests that smaller tools were likely used to process soft tissue. Most of the stone tools measured under 30mm, possibly reflecting a scarcity of large stones in the area. Some elephant bones themselves were later reshaped into larger tools. The site's characteristics align with several others in central Italy where butchered elephant remains appear alongside small stone tools and modified bones. Together, these findings point to a recurring pattern of behavior among ancient hominins during mild climate periods of the Middle Pleistocene. They also highlight central Italy as an important region for understanding how early Europeans obtained food and raw materials. The researchers note: ""Our study shows how, 400,000 years ago in the area of Rome, human groups were able to exploit an extraordinary resource like the elephant -- not only for food, but also by transforming its bones into tools."" ""Reconstructing these events means bringing to life ancient and vanished scenarios, revealing a world where humans, animals, and ecosystems interacted in ways that still surprise and fascinate us today.""",https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/10/251012054612.htm,Science,BBC,,https://www.sciencedaily.com/images/1920/middle-pleistocene-elephant-butchery-site-of-casal-lumbroso.webp,,4f64e2bfcdcfaecc003f1398a3740fad54a07ca3
4d3c00ebddf0,The Moon’s south pole hides a 4-billion-year-old secret,"nasa; moon; space exploration; space missions; dark matter; cosmology; asteroids, comets and meteors; extrasolar planets","When astronauts touch down near the moon's south pole in the coming years as part of NASA's Artemis program, they may discover a remarkable archive of clues about how the moon was born. That possibility comes from new research led by Jeffrey Andrews-Hanna, a planetary scientist at the University of Arizona. The study, published Oct. 8 in Nature , paints a vivid picture of the moon's violent early history. It could also shed light on one of lunar science's enduring mysteries: why the far side of the moon is heavily cratered while the near side, which hosted the Apollo landings of the 1960s and 1970s, is comparatively smooth. Around 4.3 billion years ago, when the solar system was still young, a massive asteroid struck the far side of the moon. The colossal impact carved out the South Pole-Aitken basin (SPA), an immense crater measuring roughly 1,200 miles from north to south and 1,000 miles from east to west. Its elongated, oval shape suggests the asteroid hit at an angle rather than head-on. By comparing SPA with other giant impact sites across the solar system, Andrews-Hanna's team found a consistent pattern: these enormous craters narrow in the direction the impactor was traveling, forming a shape similar to a teardrop or avocado. Contrary to earlier assumptions that the asteroid came from the south, their analysis shows the SPA basin tapers toward the south, meaning the asteroid likely arrived from the north. The researchers determined that the southern, or down-range, rim should be buried under thick layers of debris blasted from deep within the moon, while the northern, up-range end should contain less of this material. ""This means that the Artemis missions will be landing on the down-range rim of the basin -- the best place to study the largest and oldest impact basin on the moon, where most of the ejecta, material from deep within the moon's interior, should be piled up,"" he said. Further evidence for a north-to-south impact came from studying the moon's topography, crustal thickness, and surface chemistry. Together, these clues not only strengthen the case for the asteroid's northern origin but also reveal new details about the moon's inner structure and how it evolved over time. Scientists have long believed that the early moon was once completely molten, forming a global ""magma ocean."" As it cooled, denser minerals sank to create the mantle, while lighter ones floated upward to form the crust. Some elements, however, failed to fit neatly into these solid layers and accumulated in the last remnants of molten material. Those residual ingredients included potassium, rare earth elements, and phosphorus -- collectively known as ""KREEP,"" with the ""K"" representing potassium's chemical symbol. Andrews-Hanna noted that these elements are unusually concentrated on the moon's near side. ""If you've ever left a can of soda in the freezer, you may have noticed that as the water becomes solid, the high fructose corn syrup resists freezing until the very end and instead becomes concentrated in the last bits of liquid,"" he said. ""We think something similar happened on the moon with KREEP."" As it cooled over many millions of years, the magma ocean gradually solidified into crust and mantle. ""And eventually you get to this point where you just have that tiny bit of liquid left sandwiched between the mantle and the crust, and that's this KREEP-rich material,"" he said. ""All of the KREEP-rich material and heat-producing elements somehow became concentrated on the moon's near side, causing it to heat up and leading to intense volcanism that formed the dark volcanic plains that make for the familiar sight of the 'face' of the Moon from Earth, according to Andrews-Hanna. However, the reason why the KREEP-rich material ended up on the nearside, and how that material evolved over time, has been a mystery. ""The moon's crust is much thicker on its far side than on its near side facing the Earth, an asymmetry that has scientists puzzled to this day. This asymmetry has affected all aspects of the moon's evolution, including the latest stages of the magma ocean,"" Andrews-Hanna said. ""Our theory is that as the crust thickened on the far side, the magma ocean below was squeezed out to the sides, like toothpaste being squeezed out of a tube, until most of it ended up on the near side,"" he said. The new study of the SPA impact crater revealed a striking and unexpected asymmetry around the basin that supports exactly that scenario: The ejecta blanket on its western side is rich in radioactive thorium, but not in its eastern flank. This suggests that the gash left by the impact created a window through the moon's skin right at the boundary separating the crust underlain by the last remnants of the KREEP-enriched magma ocean from the ""regular"" crust. ""Our study shows that the distribution and composition of these materials match the predictions that we get by modeling the latest stages of the evolution of the magma ocean,"" Andrews-Hanna said. ""The last dregs of the lunar magma ocean ended up on the near side, where we see the highest concentrations of radioactive elements. But at some earlier time, a thin and patchy layer of magma ocean would have existed below parts of the far side, explaining the radioactive ejecta on one side of the SPA impact basin."" Many mysteries surrounding the moon's earliest history still remain, and once astronauts bring samples back to Earth, researchers hope to find more pieces to the puzzle. Remote sensing data collected by orbiting spacecraft like those used for this study provide researchers with a basic idea of the composition of the moon's surface, according to Andrews-Hanna. Thorium, an important element in KREEP-rich material, is easy to spot, but getting a more detailed analysis of the composition is a heavier lift. ""Those samples will be analyzed by scientists around the world, including here at the University of Arizona, where we have state -of-the-art facilities that are specially designed for those types of analyses,"" he said. ""With Artemis, we'll have samples to study here on Earth, and we will know exactly what they are,"" he said. ""Our study shows that these samples may reveal even more about the early evolution of the moon than had been thought.""",https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/10/251012054611.htm,Science,BBC,,https://www.sciencedaily.com/images/1920/south-pole-aitken-impact-basin-on-far-side-of-moon.webp,,b0a698aa9f305f0551f2c5ac3d3d361f1ec538eb
10f981f31497,New research reveals how ADHD sparks extraordinary creativity,add and adhd; learning disorders; spirituality; creativity; stem education; public health; educational policy; bioethics,"New research has found that ADHD (Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder) is linked to higher levels of creativity, and that this creative advantage may stem from a stronger tendency for the mind to wander. The findings, presented at the ECNP congress in Amsterdam, mark the first study to explain how ADHD and creativity are connected. Lead researcher Han Fang (from the Radboud University Medical Centre, the Netherlands) explained: ""Previous research pointed to mind wandering as a possible factor linking ADHD and creativity, but until now no study has directly examined this connection. We conducted two studies, utilizing 2 different groups of ADHD patients and healthy controls, one from a European group curated by the ECNP, and a second study from a UK group. In total there were 750 participants. Separately analyzing results from 2 independent groups means that we can have greater confidence in the results."" The team explored how ADHD traits, creativity, and functional challenges interact, focusing on the influence of mind wandering. Both groups displayed typical ADHD traits, including inattention, impulsivity, and frequent shifts in focus away from the task at hand. In both studies, participants with more pronounced ADHD symptoms also reported higher levels of mind wandering. Mind wandering refers to moments when attention drifts away from what a person is doing and turns inward to self-generated thoughts. Everyone experiences this to some extent, but it occurs more frequently in individuals with ADHD. Han Fang added: ""Previous researchers have been able to distinguish two different types of mind wandering. It can be a loss of concentration, where your mind may drift from subject to subject. This is 'spontaneous mind-wandering'. Another type is 'deliberate mind wandering', where people give themselves the freedom to drift off-subject, where they 'allow their thoughts to take a different course'. Psychiatrists have developed ways of measuring how much people are subject to these different tendencies."" The researchers also measured creativity in both groups (there are standards ways of measuring this, for example by asking people to find a creative use for an everyday object). They then looked at how creativity was associated with the different types of mind wandering. Dr. Han Fang said: ""We found that people with more ADHD traits such as lack of attention, hyperactivity, or impulsivity, score higher on creative achievements in both studies. This supports previous research. Additionally, we found that mind wandering, particularly deliberate mind wandering, where people allow their ""thoughts to wander on purpose,"" was associated with greater creativity in people with ADHD. This suggests that mind wandering may be an underlying factor connecting ADHD and creativity. This may have practical implications, for both psychoeducation and treatment. For psychoeducation, specially designed programs or courses that teach individuals how to utilize their spontaneous ideas, for example turning them into creative outputs, could help individuals with ADHD traits harness the benefits of mind wandering. For treatment, ADHD-tailored mindfulness-based interventions that seek to decrease spontaneous mind wandering or transform it into more deliberate forms may reduce functional impairments and enhance treatment outcomes. This is the first time this link has been investigated, so we need to see more studies which confirm the findings."" Commenting, K.P. Lesch (Professor of Molecular Psychiatry, University of Würzburg, Germany) said: ""Mind wandering is one of the critical resources on which the remarkable creativity of high-functioning ADHD individuals is based. This makes them such an incredibly valuable asset for our society and the future of our planet.""",https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/10/251012054608.htm,Science,BBC,,https://www.sciencedaily.com/images/1920/lightbulb-creativity-explosion.webp,,c478c412c7d5ecd61dcbf146f885340943331723
7955347e7275,"Closest alien civilization could be 33,000 light years away",invasive species; new species; endangered animals; evolutionary biology; galaxies; stars; cosmology; extrasolar planets,"According to new research presented at the EPSC-DPS2025 Joint Meeting in Helsinki, the nearest technological civilization in the Milky Way could be roughly 33,000 light years away. For such a civilization to exist at the same time as humanity, it would need to have lasted for at least 280,000 years -- and potentially millions of years. These findings highlight the overwhelming odds against discovering Earth-like planets that possess both plate tectonics and a nitrogen-oxygen atmosphere containing the right balance of oxygen and carbon dioxide. Taking these planetary requirements into account, the chances of success for SETI (Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence) appear slim, say Dr. Manuel Scherf and Professor Helmut Lammer of the Space Research Institute at the Austrian Academy of Sciences in Graz. ""Extraterrestrial intelligences, ETIs, in our galaxy are probably pretty rare,"" says Scherf. A planet's carbon dioxide level plays a key role in sustaining life. Higher levels of CO₂ help maintain photosynthesis and keep the atmosphere from leaking into space, but too much can trigger a runaway greenhouse effect or make the air toxic. Plate tectonics are essential because they regulate carbon dioxide through the carbon-silicate cycle, recycling the gas between the atmosphere and the planet's crust. Over time, however, carbon dioxide becomes trapped in rocks and is no longer returned to the atmosphere. ""At some point enough carbon dioxide will be drawn from the atmosphere so that photosynthesis will stop working,"" says Scherf. ""For the Earth, that's expected to happen in about 200 million to roughly one billion years."" Today, Earth's atmosphere consists mostly of nitrogen (78 percent) and oxygen (21 percent), with only a trace of carbon dioxide (0.042 percent). Scherf and Lammer modeled what would happen on other worlds. A planet with ten percent carbon dioxide -- if located farther from its sun or orbiting a dimmer, younger star -- could support a biosphere for up to 4.2 billion years. By comparison, a planet with one percent carbon dioxide would remain habitable for about 3.1 billion years. For advanced life to emerge, such planets would also need at least 18 percent oxygen. Complex animals require higher oxygen levels, and earlier studies have shown that if oxygen drops below this threshold, there would not be enough free oxygen for open-air combustion. Without fire, metalworking would be impossible, preventing the rise of any technological civilization. Scherf and Lammer compared these potential biosphere lifetimes with how long it took life on Earth to evolve technology -- about 4.5 billion years -- and with the expected longevity of intelligent species. The longer a civilization endures, the higher the likelihood that it overlaps in time with another. From these calculations, the researchers concluded that a technological species on a planet with ten percent carbon dioxide would need to persist for at least 280,000 years for even one other civilization to exist in the Milky Way at the same time as ours. ""For ten civilizations to exist at the same time as ours, the average lifetime must be above 10 million years,"" says Scherf. ""The numbers of ETIs are pretty low and depend strongly upon the lifetime of a civilization."" This means that if we do detect an ETI, it is almost certainly going to be much older than humanity. It's these numbers that also lead to the estimate that the next closest technological civilization is about 33,000 light years away. Our Sun is about 27,000 light years from the galactic center, which means that the next closest technological civilization to our own could be on the other side of the Milky Way. These numbers are not absolutes - Scherf points out that there are other factors that should be included, such as the origin of life, the origin of photosynthesis, the origin of multi-cellular life and the frequency with which intelligent life develops technology, but they cannot be quantified at present. If each of these factors has a high probability, then ETIs might not be as rare. If each of these factors has a low probability, then a more pessimistic outlook is required. Nevertheless, Scherf strongly believes that SETI should continue the search. ""Although ETIs might be rare there is only one way to really find out and that is by searching for it,"" says Scherf. ""If these searches find nothing, it makes our theory more likely, and if SETI does find something, then it will be one of the biggest scientific breakthroughs ever achieved as we would know that we are not alone in the Universe.""",https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/10/251011105533.htm,Science,BBC,,https://www.sciencedaily.com/images/1920/habitable-alien-planet-with-water-and-plants.webp,,ec680f16a5ceff971f82e238bde059c59ac61b53
21c407edf5c0,Archaeologists uncover lost land bridge that may rewrite human history,new species; nature; extreme survival; ancient civilizations; human evolution; early humans; travel and recreation; security and defense; ocean policy,"Once connected stretches of land, now hidden beneath the sea, may have given early humans a way to move between what is today Türkiye and Europe, according to groundbreaking new research in this little-studied region. The study, recently published in the peer-reviewed Journal of Island and Coastal Archaeology , reveals the first evidence of Paleolithic activity in Ayvalık and may reshape how scientists understand our species' journey into Europe. For decades, experts believed that Homo sapiens reached Europe mainly by traveling through the Balkans and the Levant, moving from Africa into the Middle East. However, the discovery of 138 stone tools spread across 10 sites within a 200 km² area suggests a different possibility. Long before Ayvalık became known for its olive groves and seaside scenery, this part of the northeastern Aegean coast (now in Turkey) may have served as another key passageway for ancient humans exploring a shifting prehistoric world. ""Our archaeological discovery has unveiled that this now-idyllic region once potentially offered a vital land bridge for human movement during the Pleistocene era -- when sea levels dropped and the now-submerged landscape was briefly exposed,"" explains Dr. Göknur Karahan, from the Department of Archaeology-Prehistory, at Hacettepe University, in Turkey, who was part of a fully female team of expert archaeologists from the country. ""We are very excited and delighted with this discovery. These findings mark Ayvalık as a potential new frontier in the story of human evolution, placing it firmly on the map of human prehistory -- opening up a new possibility for how early humans may have entered Europe. ""It feels like we are adding an entirely new page to the story of human dispersal. Our research raises exciting possibilities for future exploration, and we hope it emerges as a body of work that will shift the approach of Pleistocene archaeology for decades to come."" How were these findings possible? During the Ice Age, sea levels dropped more than 100 meters, revealing vast coastal plains that are now underwater. At that time, the modern islands and peninsulas of Ayvalık would have formed a single stretch of land, creating a natural bridge that linked Anatolia to Europe. The artifacts found in the new study were discovered along the present-day coastline, providing evidence that people once lived and traveled across these now-submerged landscapes. Until now, environmental conditions and deep sediment layers had made it difficult to detect or preserve traces of early human activity in the region. ""In all these periods, the present-day islands and peninsulas of Ayvalık would have formed interior zones within an expansive terrestrial environment,"" explains co-author Professor Kadriye Özçelik, from Ankara University. ""These paleogeographic reconstructions underscore the importance of the region for understanding hominin dispersals across the northeastern Aegean during the Pleistocene."" What was found? The region's shifting geology and active coastlines in the North Aegean made preservation difficult and the number of items uncovered ""limited,"" however this research team managed to uncover Levallois technologies from various Paleolithic periods, as well as handaxes and cleavers. Among the most significant finds include Levallois-style flake tools, sophisticated implements linked to the Middle Paleolithic Mousterian tradition -- these are often associated with Neanderthals and early Homosapiens. ""These large cutting tools are among the most iconic artifacts of the Paleolithic and are instantly recognizable even today, so are a very important find,"" explains Dr. Karahan. ""The presence of these objects in Ayvalık is particularly significant, as they provide direct evidence that the region was part of wider technological traditions shared across Africa, Asia, and Europe."" Describing the initial discovery of the 131 items, Dr. Karahan adds: ""It was a truly unforgettable moment for us. Holding the first tools in our hands was both emotional and inspiring. ""And each find from there on was a moment of excitement for the whole team. ""Holding these objects -- after walking across landscapes where no one had ever documented Paleolithic remains before -- was unforgettable."" What does this discovery tell us about early humans? The experts' key argument hinges on the potential of Ayvalık as a dynamic site for interaction and exchange, facilitating early human movement between the Anatolia peninsula and Europe. Exploring how Anatolia, with specific focus on Ayvalık, and Europe were linked during glacial sea-level low stands offers alternative pathways for how early humans moved around the region beyond dominantly emphasized northern mainland-centered routes. Addressing a gap in the scholarship, the authors' work provides a new foundation for examining resources and migration routes in which Ayvalık may have featured as part of a mobility corridor. The survey's yield of tools demonstrates a ""consistent use of Levallois technology and flake production… and a diversified toolkit,"" whilst all artefacts together offer what the team state are ""valuable insights into early human presence, raw material preferences, and technological variability."" ""The findings paint a vivid picture of early human adaptation, innovation, and mobility along the Aegean,"" Dr. Karahan explains. ""The results confirmed that Ayvalık -- which had never before been studied for its Paleolithic potential -- holds vital traces of early human activity."" Incredible recoveries, hundreds of thousands of years later As this was a survey (carried out across a two-week period in June 2022) rather than an excavation, the team could not be certain of what they would find when they set off. They knew from the region's geology and paleogeography that there was potential. They explored -- often muddy, (particularly in lowland basins and coastal plains) -- sites by foot. What followed was a ""discovery of such a diverse and well-preserved set of artifacts, which exceeded our expectations,"" Dr. Karahan says. Although these recovery efforts were not without challenges, the authors explore what both the challenges and findings reveal in the paper. They state: ""The widespread, muddy cover was considered a limiting factor for the preservation and detectability of Paleolithic materials. ""However, despite these constraints, high-quality raw material sources, such as flint and chalcedony, were identified in multiple locations, including areas affected by alluvial deposition."" Future potential Fellow author Dr. Hande Bulut, from Düzce University, adds: ""Ultimately the results underline Ayvalık's potential as a long-term hominin habitat and a key area for understanding Paleolithic technological features in the eastern Aegean. ""While preliminary, the current findings underscore the region's potential to contribute to broader debates on Aegean connectivity and technological evolution during the Pleistocene. ""Excitingly, the region between the North Aegean and the Anatolian mainland, may still hold valuable clues to early occupation despite the challenges posed by active geomorphological processes."" The team recommends future research uses a multidisciplinary approach to outline absolute dating, stratigraphic excavation, and paleoenvironmental reconstruction, which they describe as ""essential to clarify the temporal depth and functional character of the Ayvalık assemblage.""",https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/10/251011105529.htm,Science,BBC,,https://www.sciencedaily.com/images/1920/ancient-lost-land-bridge-concept.webp,,0aec6275e679543ed5f519f56a5c10eb99e4dc32
b0c85e6b540a,New simulation reveals how Earth’s magnetic field first sparked to life,telecommunications; nature of water; electricity; optics; geomagnetic storms; global warming; atmosphere; geography,"Earth is lucky to have a magnetic field that shields the planet -- and everything living on it -- from dangerous cosmic radiation. Without this invisible barrier, Earth would be exposed to the same constant stream of charged particles that bombards other planets in our solar system, such as Mars, making life there far more difficult. Scientists have long explained the source of this protective force through the dynamo theory, which describes how motion within Earth's liquid metal core creates magnetism. As the molten iron and nickel slowly cool, they form swirling convection currents in the outer core. The planet's rotation then twists these flows into a spiraling, screw-like pattern. These moving, electrically conductive materials generate electric currents that produce magnetic fields -- together forming most of Earth's overall magnetic field. Yet the theory raises a problem. Before Earth's solid inner core began to crystallize (about 1 billion years ago), the entire core was liquid. Could the planet's magnetic field have existed even then? A group of three geophysicists from ETH Zurich and SUSTech, China, set out to answer this question in a study published in Nature . New model offers fresh insight Because scientists cannot directly observe the processes deep inside Earth, they rely on computer simulations to model its internal dynamics. In this new work, the team built a detailed digital model of the planet to test whether a fully liquid core could still maintain a stable magnetic field. The calculations, some performed on the Piz Daint supercomputer at the CSCS in Lugano, revealed that magnetism can indeed arise even when viscosity -- the internal friction of the liquid metal -- has no measurable effect on the process. This finding suggests that Earth's magnetic field likely formed early in its history through mechanisms very similar to those still operating today. Remarkably, the researchers were the first to show that viscosity could be reduced to an almost negligible level in such models. ""Until now, no one has ever managed to perform such calculations under these correct physical conditions,"" says the study's lead author, Yufeng Lin. Understanding the history of the Earth's magnetic field ""This finding helps us to better understand the history of the Earth's magnetic field and is useful in interpreting data from the geological past,"" says co-author Andy Jackson, Professor of Geophysics at ETH Zurich. This also places the emergence of life in a different light. Billions of years ago, life apparently benefited from the magnetic shield, which blocked harmful radiation from space, making its development possible in the first place. The researchers can also use the new findings to study the magnetic fields of other celestial bodies such as the Sun or the planets Jupiter and Saturn. Indispensable for modern civilizations The Earth's magnetic field not only protects life, however; it plays a crucial role in making satellite communications and many other aspects of modern civilisation possible. ""It is therefore important to understand how the magnetic field is generated, how it changes over time, and what mechanisms maintain it,"" says Jackson. ""If we understand how the magnetic field is generated, we can predict its future development."" The magnetic field has changed its polarity thousands of times throughout the history of the Earth. In recent decades, researchers have also observed a rapid shift of the magnetic north pole toward the geographic north pole. It is essential for our civilization to understand how magnetism is changing on Earth. In brief: Geophysicists from ETH Zurich and SUSTech, China, have demonstrated the dynamo effect of the Earth's core in a model in which viscosity has no influence, as is the correct physical regime for the Earth. The magnetic field was created in the Earth's early history when its core was completely liquid in a similar way to today. This finding helps us to better understand the history of the Earth's magnetic field and make more precise predictions of its future development.",https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/10/251011105527.htm,Science,BBC,,https://www.sciencedaily.com/images/1920/earth-interior-1-billion-years-ago.webp,,3ed7bf0902244c0818d1ab14a966342ea741073e
1d341a2b84f8,Scientists unearth a 112-million-year-old time capsule filled with ancient insects,ecology research; animals; endangered plants; new species; fossils; origin of life; ancient dna; early mammals,"Scientists have uncovered the first South American amber deposits containing preserved insects in a quarry in Ecuador, according to a study published in Communications Earth & Environment . The discovery captures a vivid picture of a 112-million-year-old forest that once thrived on the ancient supercontinent Gondwana and opens new doors for exploring a long-overlooked prehistoric ecosystem. Amber (fossilized tree resin) has been found in samples dating back as far as 320 million years, but it became far more common between 120 million and 70 million years ago, during the Cretaceous era (143.1 million to 66 million years ago). These ancient resins sometimes contain ""bio-inclusions"" -- trapped remains of plants or animals -- that offer rare, detailed glimpses of life forms such as insects and flowers that are not usually preserved as fossils. Until now, nearly all known major amber deposits were located in the Northern Hemisphere, leaving scientists with limited insight into what Southern Hemisphere ecosystems looked like during the time when the continents were beginning to separate from Gondwana. To investigate, Xavier Delclòs and his research team examined amber and surrounding rock samples collected from the Genoveva quarry in Ecuador. The amber, dated to roughly 112 million years ago, belongs to the Hollín Formation, a sedimentary layer that stretches across Ecuador's Oriente Basin. The team identified two distinct kinds of amber: one formed underground near the roots of resin-producing plants, and another that developed in the open air. Among 60 samples of the latter, the researchers found 21 bio-inclusions representing five insect orders, including Diptera (flies), Coleoptera (beetles), and Hymenoptera (a group that includes ants and wasps), as well as a fragment of spider web. In addition, the rock surrounding the amber contained numerous plant fossils such as spores, pollen, and other botanical traces. According to the researchers, the characteristics of the fossils indicate that the amber originated in a warm, humid forest filled with dense vegetation and resin-producing trees in southern Gondwana. They emphasize that this rare find provides a crucial new resource for understanding life and biodiversity during this key period in Earth's history.",https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/10/251011105524.htm,Science,BBC,,https://www.sciencedaily.com/images/1920/112-million-year-old-midge.webp,,29b21ae568fc105e726300c4970141e163ec6c80
07eb9d205d7e,Dolphins may be getting Alzheimer’s from toxic ocean blooms,dementia; intelligence; alzheimer&amp;#039;s; social psychology; dolphins and whales; food and agriculture; animals; nature,"For many nature enthusiasts, few scenes are as distressing as finding a stranded whale or dolphin lying helpless on the beach. When these animals are still alive, marine biologists and volunteers rush to assist, shielding them from the sun and preventing their skin from drying out by pouring seawater over them or draping them with wet towels. Others work tirelessly to guide the animal back to deeper waters once the tide returns. Tragically, not every rescue attempt comes in time. Some dolphins and whales are discovered already dead, leaving behind a haunting mystery that has puzzled scientists for decades: what drives these intelligent creatures to beach themselves in the first place? A team of researchers from Florida to Wyoming believes they may have uncovered a surprising explanation. They suggest that, much like humans with dementia who sometimes wander away from familiar places, dolphins might also become disoriented due to a form of Alzheimer's-like disease. Their findings point to a connection between this disorientation and long-term exposure to harmful compounds produced by cyanobacteria -- microscopic organisms that thrive in warm, nutrient-rich waters. Research involving residents of Guam has shown that people who regularly consume foods containing cyanobacterial toxins are more likely to develop the same brain abnormalities seen in Alzheimer's disease, including misfolded tau proteins and amyloid plaques. One of the most concerning of these toxins is β-N-methylamino-L-alanine (BMAA), along with its chemical relatives 2,4-Diaminobutyric acid (2,4-DAB) and N-2-aminoethylglycine (AEG). These compounds are known to be highly toxic to nerve cells. Experiments in animals demonstrate that BMAA exposure can lead to Alzheimer's-like brain damage and cognitive decline. Once released into marine ecosystems, these toxins can build up in the food chain, eventually reaching top predators such as dolphins. When researchers examined the brains of twenty bottlenose dolphins that had stranded along Florida's Indian River Lagoon, they found significant levels of BMAA and its related toxins, especially 2,4-DAB. Dolphins that washed ashore during peak cyanobacterial bloom periods contained up to 2,900 times more 2,4-DAB than those stranded at other times of the year. Their brains showed many of the same pathological features seen in humans with Alzheimer's disease, including β-amyloid plaques and hyperphosphorylated tau proteins. The scientists also identified TDP-43 protein inclusions, a marker associated with more aggressive forms of Alzheimer's, along with 536 genes expressed in patterns consistent with the disease. The duration of cyanobacterial blooms is increasing with climate warming and nutrient inputs associated with agricultural runoff and sewage discharges. Cyanobacterial-laden waters have often been released down the St. Lucie River from Lake Okeechobee into the Indian River Lagoon. ""Since dolphins are considered environmental sentinels for toxic exposures in marine environments,"" Dr. David Davis at the Miller School of Medicine explains, ""there are concerns about human health issues associated with cyanobacterial blooms."" In 2024, Miami Dade County had the highest prevalence of Alzheimer's disease in the United States. ""Although there are likely many paths to Alzheimer's disease, cyanobacterial exposures increasingly appear to be a risk factor,"" adds Dr. Davis. ""Among Guam villagers, exposure to cyanobacterial toxins appeared to trigger neurological disease,"" said Dr. Paul Alan Cox of the Brain Chemistry Labs in Jackson Hole.

31dd1749a56b,Quantum simulations that once needed supercomputers now run on laptops,spintronics; physics; energy and resources; chemistry; spintronics research; computer modeling; computers and internet; computer science,"Picture diving deep into the quantum realm, where unimaginably small particles can exist and interact in more than a trillion possible ways at the same time. It's as complex as it sounds. To understand these mind-bending systems and their countless configurations, physicists usually turn to powerful supercomputers or artificial intelligence for help. But what if many of those same problems could be handled by a regular laptop? Scientists have long believed this was theoretically possible, yet actually achieving it has proven far more difficult. Researchers at the University at Buffalo have now taken a major step forward. They have expanded a cost-effective computational technique known as the truncated Wigner approximation (TWA), a kind of physics shortcut that simplifies quantum mathematics, so it can handle systems once thought to demand enormous computing power. Just as significant, their approach -- outlined in a study published in September in PRX Quantum , a journal of the American Physical Society -- offers a practical, easy-to-use TWA framework that lets researchers input their data and obtain meaningful results within hours. ""Our approach offers a significantly lower computational cost and a much simpler formulation of the dynamical equations,"" says the study's corresponding author, Jamir Marino, PhD, assistant professor of physics in the UB College of Arts and Sciences. ""We think this method could, in the near future, become the primary tool for exploring these kinds of quantum dynamics on consumer-grade computers."" Marino, who joined UB this fall, began this work while at Johannes Gutenberg University Mainz in Germany. His co-authors include two of his former students there, Hossein Hosseinabadi and Oksana Chelpanova, the latter now a postdoctoral researcher in Marino's lab at UB. The research received support from the National Science Foundation, the German Research Foundation, and the European Union. Taking a semiclassical approach Not every quantum system can be solved exactly. Doing so would be impractical, as the required computing power grows exponentially as the system becomes more complex. Instead, physicists often turn to what's known as semiclassical physics -- a middle-ground approach that keeps just enough quantum behavior to stay accurate, while discarding details that have little effect on the outcome. TWA is one such semiclassical approach that dates back to the 1970s, but is limited to isolated, idealized quantum systems where no energy is gained or lost. So Marino's team expanded TWA to the messier systems found in the real world, where particles are constantly pushed and pulled by outside forces and leak energy into their surroundings, otherwise known as dissipative spin dynamics. ""Plenty of groups have tried to do this before us. It's known that certain complicated quantum systems could be solved efficiently with a semiclassical approach,"" Marino says. ""However, the real challenge has been to make it accessible and easy to do."" Making quantum dynamics easy In the past, researchers looking to use TWA faced a wall of complexity. They had to re-derive the math from scratch each time they applied the method to a new quantum problem. So, Marino's team turned what used to be pages of dense, nearly impenetrable math into a straightforward conversion table that translates a quantum problem into solvable equations. ""Physicists can essentially learn this method in one day, and by about the third day, they are running some of the most complex problems we present in the study,"" Chelpanova says. Saving supercomputers for the big problems The hope is that the new method will save supercomputing clusters and AI models for the truly complicated quantum systems. These are systems that can't be solved with a semiclassical approach. Systems with not just a trillion possible states, but more states than there are atoms in the universe. ""A lot of what appears complicated isn't actually complicated,"" Marino says. ""Physicists can use supercomputing resources on the systems that need a full-fledged quantum approach and solve the rest quickly with our approach.""",https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/10/251011105515.htm,Science,BBC,,https://www.sciencedaily.com/images/1920/quantum-dynamics-laptop.webp,,5c1ac3bf9ac9386233de04d0d67fedcd3f0bd7e1
a2a8588fe254,A million-sun-mass mystery object found lurking in deep space,space exploration; space telescopes; galaxies; nasa; astrophysics; stars; sun; space station,"Astronomers have used a worldwide array of telescopes to spot the smallest dark object ever identified in the universe. Discovering more of these faint, hidden masses and understanding what they are could help eliminate certain explanations for dark matter, the invisible material believed to make up roughly one-quarter of the cosmos. Details of the discovery appear in two studies published on Oct. 9 in Nature Astronomy and the Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society . Because this object gives off no light or detectable radiation, scientists identified it through its gravitational pull on light passing nearby, an effect known as gravitational lensing. By studying how the light was distorted, researchers could calculate how much matter was packed inside the unseen object. The newly found object is so small that its presence appeared only as a tiny ""pinch"" in the distorted image created by a much larger gravitational lens -- something like a subtle flaw in a funhouse mirror. ""It's an impressive achievement to detect such a low mass object at such a large distance from us,"" said Chris Fassnacht, professor in the Department of Physics and Astronomy at the University of California, Davis, who is a co-author on the Nature Astronomy paper. ""Finding low-mass objects such as this one is critical for learning about the nature of dark matter."" This mysterious object weighs about 1 million times as much as the Sun. Its true identity is still uncertain: it could be a dense clump of dark matter, roughly 100 times smaller than any previously detected, or possibly an extremely compact, inactive dwarf galaxy. Though it cannot be seen directly, dark matter's gravitational influence is thought to shape how galaxies, stars, and other visible matter are arranged across the universe. One of the major questions in astronomy is whether dark matter can form small, starless clumps. Finding such objects could either support or challenge current theories about what dark matter is. Using telescopes worldwide To detect the faint signals from the object, researchers combined data from several powerful instruments, including the Green Bank Telescope (GBT) in West Virginia, the Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA) in Hawaiʻi, and the European Very Long Baseline Interferometric Network (EVN), which links radio telescopes across Europe, Asia, South Africa, and Puerto Rico. Together, these instruments functioned like a single Earth-sized telescope capable of detecting incredibly subtle distortions in light caused by the dark object's gravity. This detection represents an object with a mass about one hundred times smaller than any previously found using this method, showing that the technique can reveal other similarly small dark structures. ""Given the sensitivity of our data, we were expecting to find at least one dark object, so our discovery is consistent with the so-called 'cold dark matter theory' on which much of our understanding of how galaxies form is based,"" said lead author Devon Powell at the Max Planck Institute for Astrophysics (MPA), Germany. ""Having found one, the question now is whether we can find more and whether the numbers will still agree with the models."" The team is further analyzing the data to better understand the nature of the dark object, and also looking for more examples of such dark objects in other parts of the sky.

c0a52fe2e421,Breakthrough compounds may reverse nerve damage caused by multiple sclerosis,diseases and conditions; today&amp;#039;s healthcare; stem cells; disability; stroke; relationships; brain injury; k-12 education,"Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a long-term autoimmune condition that affects over 2.9 million people around the world. In MS, the immune system mistakenly attacks the myelin sheath, a protective layer that insulates nerve fibers. This damage interrupts communication between the brain and body, leading to symptoms such as numbness, tingling, vision problems, and paralysis. Although existing treatments can help reduce inflammation, there are still no approved therapies that protect neurons or rebuild the damaged myelin sheath. Scientists have now made significant progress toward that goal with support from the National Multiple Sclerosis Society. Their work has led to the discovery of two compounds capable of promoting remyelination, the process of repairing the myelin coating on nerve fibers. The study, published in Scientific Reports , was led by Seema Tiwari-Woodruff, a professor of biomedical sciences at the University of California, Riverside, School of Medicine, and John Katzenellenbogen, a professor of chemistry at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (UIUC). The research was funded through two National MS Society initiatives: a standard investigator-initiated grant and the organization's Fast Forward program, which accelerates commercialization of promising research. ""Our work represents more than a decade of collaboration, with the last four years focused on identifying and optimizing new drug candidates that show strong potential to treat MS and possibly other neurological diseases involving demyelination,"" Tiwari-Woodruff said. With this support, the team launched a drug development program that has since been licensed by Cadenza Bio, Inc. Backed by investor funding, the company has continued advancing the research and is preparing for clinical testing of what could become a first-of-its-kind treatment for people with MS. From discovery to development This new work builds on earlier studies involving a compound called indazole chloride, which had shown promise in promoting myelin repair and regulating immune responses in mouse models of MS. However, indazole chloride lacked the chemical properties and patent potential required for clinical and commercial use, Tiwari-Woodruff explained. Working with UIUC chemists Katzenellenbogen and Sung Hoon Kim, who created new versions of the molecule, Tiwari-Woodruff's group, led by recent UC Riverside graduate Micah Feri, screened more than 60 analogs of indazole chloride. From this effort, they identified two standout candidates, K102 and K110. Both showed better safety, efficacy, and drug-like characteristics in tests using mice and human cells. Among the two, K102 emerged as the leading candidate. It not only stimulated myelin repair but also helped regulate immune activity, a critical balance for MS therapies. The compound also performed well in human oligodendrocytes -- cells responsible for producing myelin -- derived from induced pluripotent stem cells, suggesting the results could translate effectively from animal studies to human disease. Normally, oligodendrocyte precursor cells develop into mature myelin-producing cells that repair nerve insulation. In MS, this repair process often breaks down, leading to lasting nerve damage. A compound like K102 that can restore myelin could help improve nerve signal transmission and potentially limit long-term disability. ""K110 is also a strong candidate,"" Tiwari-Woodruff said. ""It has slightly different central nervous system effects and may be better suited for other conditions like spinal cord injury or traumatic brain injury, so we're keeping it in the pipeline."" From bench to biotech Tiwari-Woodruff and Katzenellenbogen credit the National MS Society's Fast Forward program as a turning point. Fast Forward accelerates the commercialization of promising therapies by promoting academic-industry partnerships. The highly competitive grant enabled Tiwari-Woodruff and Katzenellenbogen to generate sufficient data to license the rights to Cadenza Bio to develop K102 and K110. The patents are jointly held by UCR and UIUC, with an exclusive, worldwide licensing agreement in place between the universities and Cadenza Bio. ""This project has been a good example of how long-standing academic collaborations can lead to real-world applications,"" Katzenellenbogen said. ""Our shared goal was always to take a promising idea and develop it into a therapy that could help people with MS. We're finally getting close to that reality."" Initially, UCR's Office of Technology Partnerships collaborated with UIUC to seek patent protection. Grace Yee, assistant director of technology commercialization at UCR, said the joint efforts of UCR, UIUC, and the National MS Society advocated for and promoted the technology to investors and industry for commercial development. ""Our entrepreneurs-in-residence also helped advise the project, so the team was able to develop materials and messaging to highlight the project's commercial value,"" she said. ""When investors expressed interest in the technology, UCR and UIUC helped them understand how the technology addresses an unmet need in treating MS. These efforts led to the licensing agreement with Cadenza Bio."" Elaine Hamm, chief operating officer at Cadenza Bio, said she and Carol Curtis, cofounder of Cadenza Bio, were impressed by the possibility of moving from slowing axon damage to repairing axon damage. ""This is the future we want to build,"" Hamm said. ""It is why we licensed the technology, and why we are excited to move it forward to patients in need."" More than a decade in the making Tiwari-Woodruff and Katzenellenbogen have worked together for more than 12 years. Tiwari-Woodruff's move from UCLA to UCR in 2014, she said, turned out to be a pivotal decision. ""The support from UCR -- from leadership to infrastructure -- has been extraordinary,"" Tiwari-Woodruff said. ""None of this would've been possible without that backing. Funding for academic labs like mine and John's is crucial. This is selfless work, driven by a deep love of science and commitment to human health."" Though the initial focus is MS, the team believes K102 and K110 could eventually be applied to other diseases involving neuronal damage, including stroke and neurodegeneration. Cadenza Bio is now advancing K102 through the necessary non-clinical studies required to support first-in-human clinical trials. ""We're hopeful that clinical trials can begin soon,"" said Tiwari-Woodruff. ""It's been a long journey -- but this is what translational science is all about: turning discovery into real-world impact.""

Published in Nature Genetics , the research provides new clues that could guide the creation of treatments focused on these specific cells. It also enhances scientific understanding of depression, a condition that affects more than 264 million people globally and is one of the leading causes of disability. ""This is the first time we've been able to identify what specific brain cell types are affected in depression by mapping gene activity together with mechanisms that regulate the DNA code,"" said senior author Dr. Gustavo Turecki, a professor at McGill, clinician-scientist at the Douglas Institute and Canada Research Chair in Major Depressive Disorder and Suicide. ""It gives us a much clearer picture of where disruptions are happening, and which cells are involved."" Rare brain bank enables breakthrough The team conducted their work using post-mortem brain tissue from the Douglas-Bell Canada Brain Bank, one of the few collections worldwide that includes donations from people with psychiatric conditions. Through advanced single-cell genomic analysis, the researchers examined RNA and DNA from thousands of individual brain cells to determine which ones behaved differently in people with depression and which DNA sequences might explain these variations. The study analyzed tissue from 59 individuals who had depression and 41 who did not. They discovered that gene activity was altered in two types of brain cells: a class of excitatory neurons responsible for mood and stress regulation, and a subtype of microglia, the immune cells that manage inflammation in the brain. In both cell types, many genes were expressed differently in people with depression, pointing to possible disruptions in vital neural systems. By identifying the specific cells affected, the research deepens understanding of the biological foundation of depression and helps dispel outdated views of the condition. ""This research reinforces what neuroscience has been telling us for years,"" Turecki said. ""Depression isn't just emotional, it reflects real, measurable changes in the brain."" Looking ahead, the scientists intend to explore how these cellular changes influence brain function and whether targeting them could lead to more effective treatments.

These communities followed the return of seasonal water sources and left behind an extraordinary record of their presence through monumental rock art. An international team of archaeologists, coordinated by the Heritage Commission of the Saudi Ministry of Culture, uncovered the findings through the Green Arabia Project. The team included experts from the Max Planck Institute of Geoanthropology, KAUST (King Abdullah University of Science and Technology), University College London, Griffith University, and several other institutions. Researchers documented over 60 rock art panels featuring 176 individual engravings across three previously unexplored locations: Jebel Arnaan, Jebel Mleiha, and Jebel Misma, situated along the southern edge of the Nefud Desert in northern Saudi Arabia. The engravings, which depict animals such as camels, ibex, equids, gazelles, and aurochs, include 130 highly detailed and life-sized figures, some reaching up to 3 meters long and more than 2 meters tall. Dating to between 12,800 and 11,400 years ago, the engravings correspond to a time when temporary lakes and rivers reappeared after centuries of extreme aridity. Sediment analysis confirmed the existence of these ancient water sources, which would have provided essential support for human groups venturing into the desert interior and allowed them to survive in this challenging environment. ""These large engravings are not just rock art -- they were probably statements of presence, access, and cultural identity,"" said lead author, Dr. Maria Guagnin from Max Planck Institute of Geoanthropology. Dr. Ceri Shipton, co-lead author from the Institute of Archaeology, University College London, said: ""The rock art marks water sources and movement routes, possibly signifying territorial rights and intergenerational memory."" Unlike previously known sites where engravings were hidden in crevices, the Jebel Mleiha and the Jebel Arnaan panels were etched onto towering cliff faces, some up to 39 meters high, in visually commanding locations. One panel would have required ancient artists to climb and work precariously on narrow ledges, underscoring the sheer effort and significance of the imagery. Artefacts including Levantine-style El Khiam and Helwan stone points, green pigment, and dentalium beads suggest long-distance connections to Pre-Pottery Neolithic (PPN) populations in the Levant region. However, the scale, content, and placement of the Arabian engravings set them apart. ""This unique form of symbolic expression belongs to a distinct cultural identity adapted to life in a challenging, arid environment,"" said Dr. Faisal Al-Jibreen, from the Heritage Commmission, Saudi Ministry of Culture. ""The project's interdisciplinary approach has begun to fill a critical gap in the archaeological record of northern Arabia between the LGM and the Holocene, shedding light on the resilience and innovation of early desert communities,"" said Michael Petraglia, lead of the Green Arabia project.

095ab8b06ef5,MIT’s new precision gene editing tool could transform medicine,alternative medicine; personalized medicine; healthy aging; diseases and conditions; pharmacology; today&amp;#039;s healthcare; medical devices; medical imaging,"A gene-editing approach called prime editing could one day help treat many illnesses by turning faulty genes into healthy ones. However, the technique sometimes introduces small mistakes into DNA, which can occasionally be harmful. Researchers at MIT have now discovered a way to significantly reduce these errors by altering the key proteins that drive the editing process. They believe this improvement could make gene therapy safer and more practical for treating a wide range of diseases. ""This paper outlines a new approach to doing gene editing that doesn't complicate the delivery system and doesn't add additional steps, but results in a much more precise edit with fewer unwanted mutations,"" says Phillip Sharp, an MIT Institute Professor Emeritus, a member of MIT's Koch Institute for Integrative Cancer Research, and one of the senior authors of the new study. Using their refined method, the MIT team lowered the rate of mistakes in prime editing from roughly one in seven edits to about one in 101 for the most common editing type. In a more precise editing mode, the improvement went from one in 122 to one in 543. ""For any drug, what you want is something that is effective, but with as few side effects as possible,"" says Robert Langer, the David H. Koch Institute Professor at MIT, a member of the Koch Institute, and one of the senior authors of the new study. ""For any disease where you might do genome editing, I would think this would ultimately be a safer, better way of doing it."" Koch Institute research scientist Vikash Chauhan led the study, which was recently published in Nature . The potential for error In the 1990s, early gene therapy efforts relied on inserting new genes into cells using modified viruses. Later, scientists developed techniques that used enzymes like zinc finger nucleases to directly repair genes. These enzymes worked but were difficult to reengineer for new DNA targets, making them slow and cumbersome to use. The discovery of the CRISPR system in bacteria changed everything. CRISPR uses an enzyme called Cas9, guided by a piece of RNA, to cut DNA at a specific location. Researchers adapted it to remove faulty DNA sequences or insert corrected ones using an RNA-based template, making gene editing faster and more flexible. In 2019, scientists at the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard introduced prime editing, a new version of CRISPR that is even more precise and less likely to affect unintended areas of the genome. More recently, prime editing was used successfully to treat a patient with chronic granulomatous disease (CGD), a rare disorder that weakens white blood cells. ""In principle, this technology could eventually be used to address many hundreds of genetic diseases by correcting small mutations directly in cells and tissues,"" Chauhan says. One of the advantages of prime editing is that it doesn't require making a double-stranded cut in the target DNA. Instead, it uses a modified version of Cas9 that cuts just one of the complementary strands, opening up a flap where a new sequence can be inserted. A guide RNA delivered along with the prime editor serves as the template for the new sequence. One reason prime editing is considered safer is that it doesn’t cut both strands of DNA. Instead, it makes a gentler, single-strand cut using a modified Cas9 enzyme. This opens a small flap in the DNA where a new, corrected sequence can be inserted, guided by an RNA template. Once the corrected sequence is added, it must replace the original DNA strand. If the old strand reattaches instead, the new fragment can sometimes end up in the wrong spot, leading to unintended errors. Most of these mistakes are harmless, but in rare cases they could contribute to tumor growth or other health issues. In current prime editing systems, the error rate can vary from about one in seven edits to one in 121, depending on the editing mode. ""The technologies we have now are really a lot better than earlier gene therapy tools, but there's always a chance for these unintended consequences,"" Chauhan says. Precise editing To reduce those error rates, the MIT team decided to take advantage of a phenomenon they had observed in a 2023 study. In that paper, they found that while Cas9 usually cuts in the same DNA location every time, some mutated versions of the protein show a relaxation of those constraints. Instead of always cutting the same location, those Cas9 proteins would sometimes make their cut one or two bases further along the DNA sequence. This relaxation, the researchers discovered, makes the old DNA strands less stable, so they get degraded, making it easier for the new strands to be incorporated without introducing any errors. In the new study, the researchers were able to identify Cas9 mutations that dropped the error rate to 1/20th its original value. Then, by combining pairs of those mutations, they created a Cas9 editor that lowered the error rate even further, to 1/36th the original amount. To make the editors even more accurate, the researchers incorporated their new Cas9 proteins into a prime editing system that has an RNA binding protein that stabilizes the ends of the RNA template more efficiently. This final editor, which the researchers call vPE, had an error rate just 1/60th of the original, ranging from one in 101 edits to one in 543 edits for different editing modes. These tests were performed in mouse and human cells. The MIT team is now working on further improving the efficiency of prime editors, through further modifications of Cas9 and the RNA template. They are also working on ways to deliver the editors to specific tissues of the body, which is a longstanding challenge in gene therapy. They also hope that other labs will begin using the new prime editing approach in their research studies. Prime editors are commonly used to explore many different questions, including how tissues develop, how populations of cancer cells evolve, and how cells respond to drug treatment. ""Genome editors are used extensively in research labs,"" Chauhan says. ""So the therapeutic aspect is exciting, but we are really excited to see how people start to integrate our editors into their research workflows.""

94b4d36af5a1,USC engineers just made light smarter with “optical thermodynamics”,telecommunications; physics; optics; energy and resources; electronics; consumer electronics; thermodynamics; quantum physics,"A research group from the Ming Hsieh Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering has achieved a major advance in photonics with the creation of the first optical device built on the emerging concept of optical thermodynamics. Their findings, published in Nature Photonics , reveal an entirely new way to control and direct light in nonlinear systems (systems that operate without switches, external controls, or digital commands). In this setup, light is not forced through specific routes; instead, it moves naturally through the device, guided by basic thermodynamic behavior. From Valves to Routers to Light The idea of routing is common across engineering disciplines. In mechanics, a manifold valve controls where fluids flow. In electronics, a Wi-Fi router or Ethernet switch sends digital information from multiple input sources to the correct output port, ensuring every signal reaches its destination. Achieving a similar kind of routing with light, however, has long been much more complex. Traditional optical routers rely on intricate switch networks and electrical control systems to change light’s path, which adds layers of complexity and limits both speed and performance. Researchers at the USC Viterbi School of Engineering have now demonstrated a completely different approach. The concept can be imagined as a marble maze that organizes itself. Normally, a person would need to lift barriers and adjust the path to guide a marble to the right hole. In the USC team’s device, the maze is structured so that no matter where you drop the marble, it will roll toward its correct destination automatically. Light behaves in the same way within this system—it finds the appropriate path on its own by following the rules of thermodynamics. Potential Industry Impact The potential applications of this discovery reach well beyond academic research. As modern computing and data transfer continue to stretch the limits of conventional electronics, leading companies (including chip designers such as NVIDIA and others) are investigating optical technologies as faster and more energy-efficient alternatives. By offering a natural, self-organizing method for directing light signals, optical thermodynamics could speed up progress in these efforts. In addition to chip-level communication, this principle may also influence fields such as telecommunications, high-performance computing, and secure information transfer, paving the way for simpler yet more powerful optical systems. How it Works: Chaos Tamed by Thermodynamics Nonlinear multimode optical systems have often been viewed as chaotic and difficult to control. Their many overlapping light patterns make them extremely challenging to model or design for practical purposes. Yet this very complexity hides rich physical behavior that has remained largely untapped. The USC researchers realized that light in these nonlinear environments behaves much like a gas moving toward thermal equilibrium, where random collisions eventually create a stable distribution of energy. Based on this insight, they developed the theoretical framework of ""optical thermodynamics,"" describing how light in nonlinear lattices can undergo processes analogous to expansion, compression, and even phase transitions. This model provides a unified way to understand and harness the natural self-organization of light. A Device that Routes Light by Itself The team's demonstration in Nature Photonics marks the first device designed with this new theory. Rather than actively steering the signal, the system is engineered so that the light routes itself. The principle is directly inspired by thermodynamics. Just as a gas undergoing what's known as a Joule-Thomson expansion redistributes its pressure and temperature before naturally reaching thermal equilibrium, light in the USC device experiences a two-step process: first an optical analogue of expansion, then thermal equilibrium. The result is a self-organized flow of photons into the designated output channel -- without any need for external switches. Opening a New Frontier By effectively turning chaos into predictability, optical thermodynamics opens the door to the creation of a new class of photonic devices that harness, rather than fight against, the complexity of nonlinear systems. ""Beyond routing, this framework could also enable entirely new approaches to light management, with implications for information processing, communications, and the exploration of fundamental physics,"" said the study's lead author, Hediyeh M. Dinani, a PhD student in the Optics and Photonics Group lab at USC Viterbi. The Steven and Kathryn Sample Chair in Engineering, and Professor of Electrical and Computer Engineering at USC Viterbi Demetrios Christodoulides added, ""What was once viewed as an intractable challenge in optics has been reframed as a natural physical process -- one that may redefine how engineers approach the control of light and other electromagnetic signals.""",https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/10/251010091551.htm,Science,BBC,,https://www.sciencedaily.com/images/1920/optical-thermodynamics-optic-device.webp,,38260ed8d637bd77bed1a13e252ef537f43bb265
43e87611adb0,"They’re smaller than dust, but crucial for Earth’s climate",ecology research; microbes and more; dolphins and whales; marine biology; ecology; global warming; environmental issues; air quality,"Smaller than a grain of dust and shaped like minute discs, coccolithophores are microscopic ocean dwellers with an outsized influence on the planet’s climate. These tiny algae remove carbon from seawater, release oxygen, and create delicate calcite plates that eventually sink to the ocean floor. Over time, these plates form chalk and limestone layers that record Earth’s climate history. Today, five European research institutions announced a new effort to establish October 10 as International Coccolithophore Day, drawing attention to the organisms’ vital contributions to carbon regulation, oxygen production, and the health of marine ecosystems that sustain life on Earth. The initiative is being led by the Ruđer Bošković Institute (Zagreb, Croatia), the Lyell Centre at Heriot-Watt University (Edinburgh, UK), NORCE Norwegian Research Centre (Bergen, Norway), Marine and Environmental Sciences Centre (MARE) at the University of Lisbon (Portugal), and the International Nannoplankton Association (INA). A Delicate Balance Under Threat Few people are aware of coccolithophores, yet without them, the planet’s oceans and climate would look drastically different. These single-celled algae, which contain chlorophyll, float in the sunlit layers of the sea and are coated with calcium carbonate plates known as coccoliths. Though incredibly small, coccolithophores are among Earth’s most effective natural carbon regulators. Every year, they generate more than 1.5 billion tonnes of calcium carbonate, capturing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and storing it in deep-sea sediments. In addition to removing carbon, they produce oxygen, nourish marine food webs, and influence the planet’s greenhouse balance. Coccolithophores often dominate vast stretches of the ocean, but climate change is altering the temperature, chemistry, and nutrient makeup of seawater. These shifts pose serious risks to their survival—and to the stability of the ecosystems that depend on them. Why Coccolithophores? What makes coccolithophores stand out from other plankton is both their role in the global carbon cycle and the unique record they leave behind. ""Unlike other groups, they build intricate calcium carbonate plates that not only help draw down carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, but also transport it into deep ocean sediments, where it can be locked away for millennia. This biomineralization leaves behind an exceptional geological record, allowing us to study how they've responded to past climate shifts and better predict their future role. In short, their dual role as carbon pumps and climate archives makes them irreplaceable in understanding and tackling climate change,"" says Professor Alex Poulton of the Lyell Centre. ""They are the ocean's invisible architects, crafting the tiny plates that become vast archives of Earth's climate,"" says Dr. Jelena Godrijan, a leading coccolithophore researcher at the Ruđer Bošković Institute. ""By studying their past and current responses to changes in the ocean, we can better understand how marine ecosystems function and explore how natural processes might help us tackle climate change.'' Cutting-Edge Science: From Plankton to Planetary Processes The launch of International Coccolithophore Day spotlights the tiny ocean plankton that quietly help regulate atmospheric carbon dioxide. At the Lyell Centre in Scotland, the OceanCANDY team, led by Prof. Alex Poulton, studies how these plankton pull CO2 from the air and store it in the sea, and tests how warmer, more acidic oceans could alter this process. Computer forecasts compare which species do this job best, today and tomorrow. In Norway, scientists at NORCE Research, led by Dr. Kyle Mayers and his team, track coccolithophore life stories, how they grow, who eats them, and the viruses that infect and ultimately kill them, to show how carbon moves through the ocean. Ancient DNA in seafloor mud adds a long view of past climate shifts. ""Coccolithophore interactions with viruses and grazers matter,"" says Dr. Kyle Mayers of NORCE. ""These links shape food webs and how the ocean stores carbon."" In Croatia, the Cocco team at the Ruđer Bošković Institute study how they shape the ocean's carbon cycle, from the decay of organic matter to bacterial interactions that influence seawater chemistry and CO2 uptake. ""In understanding coccolithophores, we're really uncovering the living engine of the ocean's carbon balance,"" says Dr. Jelena Godrijan ""Their interactions with bacteria determine how carbon moves and transforms -- processes that connect the microscopic scale of plankton to the stability of our planet's climate."" At MARE, University of Lisbon, Dr. Catarina V. Guerreiro leads studies to trace how aerosol-driven fertilization shapes the distribution of coccolithophores across the Atlantic into the Southern Ocean, and what that means for the ocean's carbon pumps today and in recent times. Her approach consists of combining aerosol and seawater samples with sediment records, satellite data and lab microcosms to pin down cause and effect. ""We're connecting tiny chalky organisms to planetary carbon flows,"" says Dr. Guerreiro. At INA, scientists connect living coccolithophores to their fossil record, using their microscopic plates to date rocks and trace Earth's climate history. By refining global biostratigraphic frameworks and calibrating species' evolutionary timelines, INA researchers transform fossils of coccolithophores into precise tools for reconstructing ancient oceans, linking modern plankton ecology with the geological record of climate change. Why Coccolithophore Day Matters? Designating a day for Coccolithophores may seem like a small gesture, but its advocates argue it could have a big impact. ""This could contribute to changing the way we see the ocean. ""We most often talk about whales, coral reefs, and ice caps, but coccolithophores are a vital part of the planet's climate system. They remind us that the smallest organisms can have the biggest impact, and that microscopic life plays a crucial role in shaping our planet's future, "" says Dr. Sarah Cryer from the CHALKY project and OceanCANDY team. The campaign to establish October 10 as International Coccolithophore Day is a call to action. By highlighting the profound, yet often overlooked, role of coccolithophores, scientists want to inspire a new wave of ocean literacy, policy focus, and public engagement.",https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/10/251010091548.htm,Science,BBC,,https://www.sciencedaily.com/images/1920/coccolithophore-syracosphaera-mediterranea.webp,,970de6bd1f4f2a137dd5d824aa8cf8e6b4a06889
ce907efc058b,"Tiny asteroid flew right over Antarctica, and no one saw it coming","space exploration; space telescopes; nasa; asteroids, comets and meteors; dark matter; space station; solar system; astrophysics","Asteroid 2025 TF passed over Antarctica at 00:47:26 UTC ± 18 seconds on October 1, coming within 428 ± 7 km of Earth's surface. That distance is nearly the same as the orbit of the International Space Station (approx. 370 -- 460 km). Measuring about 1 to 3 meters in diameter, the asteroid was detected by the Catalina Sky Survey only a few hours after it had already passed by Earth. Space rocks of this size do not present any real threat. If one enters the atmosphere, it can create a bright fireball and sometimes leave behind small meteorites on the ground. Soon after its detection, astronomers from ESA's Planetary Defence Office observed the object using the Las Cumbres Observatory telescope at Siding Spring in Australia. Finding and tracking such a small object in the vastness of space, especially when its position is still uncertain, is a remarkable achievement. These follow-up observations allowed scientists to determine the asteroid's distance and timing of closest approach with outstanding precision. Understanding the Risk: How Size Shapes the Threat Asteroid 2025 TF, only a few meters wide, belongs to a class of near-Earth objects that are considered harmless on a planetary scale. Space rocks this small enter Earth's atmosphere several times each year, usually breaking apart high above the surface. When they do reach lower altitudes, the result is typically a spectacular fireball, sometimes followed by tiny meteorites scattered across the ground. Events of this scale rarely cause damage and often help scientists learn more about asteroid composition. By comparison, objects measuring around 20 meters across -- such as the one that exploded over Chelyabinsk, Russia, in 2013 -- can generate powerful airbursts capable of damaging buildings and injuring people with shockwaves. That explosion released energy equivalent to hundreds of kilotons of TNT, reminding scientists that even modestly sized asteroids can have local effects. Larger asteroids, those hundreds of meters or more in diameter, pose a much greater risk. While such events are rare, they have the potential to cause regional or even global consequences. For this reason, international efforts like ESA's Planetary Defence Office and NASA's Planetary Defense Coordination Office monitor and catalog these objects to predict potential impacts years or decades in advance. Global Eyes on the Sky Worldwide networks of observatories continually scan the heavens for moving objects, from bright comets to faint, fast-moving asteroids like 2025 TF. Surveys such as the Catalina Sky Survey and Pan-STARRS regularly discover new near-Earth objects, while dedicated follow-up telescopes refine their orbits. These coordinated efforts form the backbone of planetary defense. When astronomers detect an object passing extremely close to Earth, even one just a few meters wide, they can test their detection systems and improve prediction models. Each observation strengthens our ability to identify potential hazards early, giving scientists valuable data for future encounters. Why Close Passes Matter Although Asteroid 2025 TF never posed a threat, flybys like this one highlight how dynamic and watchful our solar neighborhood is. Every close encounter serves as both a reminder of Earth's vulnerability and a demonstration of the growing precision of modern astronomy. The successful tracking of such a tiny object so soon after its discovery shows just how far planetary defense efforts have come -- and how prepared the global scientific community is to respond to whatever space sends our way.",https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/10/251009033240.htm,Science,BBC,,https://www.sciencedaily.com/images/1920/esa-spots-asteroid-that-made-very-close-approach-to-earth.webp,,dbb289501641feac2caee8db7200256b09b2d80d
f65b40519d73,JWST spots a hidden red supergiant just before it exploded,space exploration; nasa; black holes; galaxies; space telescopes; astrophysics; astronomy; sun,"A team of astronomers led by Northwestern University has captured the clearest and most detailed view ever of a dying star before its dramatic explosion. Using NASA’s James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), the international group identified the source of a supernova, known as its progenitor, in mid-infrared light for the first time. When combined with archival observations from the Hubble Space Telescope, the data revealed that the blast originated from a massive red supergiant star wrapped in an unexpected blanket of dust. This breakthrough may finally explain why astronomers rarely see red supergiants explode, even though models predict they should account for most core-collapse supernovae. The new findings suggest these enormous stars do explode but are often hidden from view by thick dust clouds. Thanks to JWST’s powerful infrared vision, scientists can now see through the obscuring dust, bridging the long-standing gap between theory and observation. The research, published on Oct. 8 in The Astrophysical Journal Letters , represents JWST’s first confirmed detection of a supernova’s progenitor star. ""For multiple decades, we have been trying to determine exactly what the explosions of red supergiant stars look like,"" said Northwestern's Charlie Kilpatrick, who led the study. ""Only now, with JWST, do we finally have the quality of data and infrared observations that allow us to say precisely the exact type of red supergiant that exploded and what its immediate environment looked like. We've been waiting for this to happen -- for a supernova to explode in a galaxy that JWST had already observed. We combined Hubble and JWST data sets to completely characterize this star for the first time."" Kilpatrick, a research assistant professor at Northwestern’s Center for Interdisciplinary Exploration and Research in Astrophysics, is an expert on the life cycles of massive stars. His coauthor, Aswin Suresh, a graduate student in physics and astronomy at Northwestern’s Weinberg College of Arts and Sciences, played a key role in the analysis. Reddest, dustiest progenitor ever observed The team first detected the supernova, named SN2025pht, on June 29, 2025, using the All-Sky Automated Survey of Supernovae. The event’s light traveled from the nearby spiral galaxy NGC 1637, located about 40 million light-years from Earth. By comparing Hubble and JWST images of NGC 1637 taken before and after the explosion, Kilpatrick, Suresh, and their collaborators pinpointed the progenitor star. It immediately stood out as both brilliant and intensely red. Although the star radiated roughly 100,000 times more light than the Sun, much of its glow was hidden by surrounding dust. The layer of dust was so dense that it made the star appear over 100 times dimmer in visible light than it would otherwise look. Because the dust blocked shorter, bluer wavelengths, the star’s appearance shifted dramatically toward red. ""It's the reddest, dustiest red supergiant that we've seen explode as a supernova,"" Suresh said. Massive stars in the late stages of their lives, red supergiants are among the largest stars in the universe. When their cores collapse, they explode as Type II supernovae, leaving behind either a neutron star or black hole. The most familiar example of a red supergiant is Betelguese, the bright reddish star in the shoulder of the constellation Orion. ""SN2025pht is surprising because it appeared much redder than almost any other red supergiant we've seen explode as a supernova,"" Kilpatrick added. ""That tells us that previous explosions might have been much more luminous than we thought because we didn't have the same quality of infrared data that JWST can now provide."" Clues hidden in dust The deluge of dust could help explain why astronomers have struggled to find red supergiant progenitors. Most massive stars that explode as supernovae are the brightest and most luminous objects in the sky. So, theoretically, they should be easy to spot before they explode. But that hasn't been the case. Astronomers posit that the most massive aging stars also might be the dustiest. These thick cloaks of dust might dim the stars' light to the point of utter undetectability. The new JWST observations support this hypothesis. ""I've been arguing in favor of that interpretation, but even I didn't expect to see such an extreme example as SN2025pht,"" Kilpatrick said. ""It would explain why these more massive supergiants are missing because they tend to be dustier."" In addition to the presence of dust itself, the dust's composition was also surprising. While red supergiants tend to produce oxygen-rich, silicate dust, this star's dust appeared rich with carbon. This suggests that powerful convection in the star's final years may have dredged up carbon from deep inside, enriching its surface and altering the type of dust it produced. ""The infrared wavelengths of our observations overlap with an important silicate dust feature that's characteristic of some red supergiant spectra,"" Kilpatrick said. ""This tells us that the wind was very rich in carbon and less rich in oxygen, which also was somewhat surprising for a red supergiant of this mass."" A new era for exploding stars The new study marks the first time astronomers have used JWST to directly identify a supernova progenitor star, opening the door to many more discoveries. By capturing light across the near- and mid-infrared spectrum, JWST can reveal hidden stars and provide missing pieces for how the most massive stars live and die. The team now is searching for similar red supergiants that may explode as supernovae in the future. Observations by NASA's upcoming Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope may help this search. Roman will have the resolution, sensitivity and infrared wavelength coverage to see these stars and potentially witness their variability as they expel out large quantities of dust near the end of their lives.

9e339364457c,Scientists stunned by wild Martian dust devils racing at hurricane speeds,mars; space exploration; nasa; space missions; computer modeling; hacking; math puzzles; mathematical modeling,"Although Mars has an extremely thin atmosphere, it still experiences powerful winds that play a major role in shaping the planet’s climate and in distributing its ever-present dust. These winds stir up dust into swirling columns called dust devils—rotating plumes of air and fine particles that sweep across the Martian surface. While the winds themselves are invisible, the dust devils they lift can be seen clearly in spacecraft images. Because they trace the flow of moving air, scientists use them as natural markers to study wind behavior that would otherwise remain unseen. A new study led by Dr. Valentin Bickel from the Center for Space and Habitability at the University of Bern reveals that both dust devils and the winds driving them are much faster than scientists previously believed. These stronger winds may be responsible for much of the dust lofted into the Martian atmosphere, which has a major impact on the planet’s weather and long-term climate. The research, conducted in collaboration with the University of Bern’s Department of Space Research and Planetology, the Open University in the UK, and the German Aerospace Center (DLR), was recently published in Science Advances . Movement of dust devils studied with the help of deep learning ""Using a state-of-the-art deep learning approach, we were able to identify dust devils in over 50,000 satellite images,"" explains first author Valentin Bickel. The team used images from the Bern-based Mars camera CaSSIS (Color and Stereo Surface Imaging System) and the stereo camera HRSC (High Resolution Stereo Camera). CaSSIS is on board the European Space Agency's (ESA) ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter, while the HRSC camera is on board the ESA orbiter Mars Express. ""Our study is therefore based exclusively on data from European Mars exploration,"" Bickel continues. Next, the team studied stereo images of about 300 of these dust devils to determine their movement and speed. Co-author Nicolas Thomas, who led the development of the CaSSIS camera system at the University of Bern and whose work is funded by SERI’s Swiss Space Office through ESA’s PRODEX program, explains: ""Stereo images are images of the same spot on the surface of Mars, but taken a few seconds apart. These images can therefore be used to measure the movement of dust devils."" Bickel emphasizes: ""If you put the stereo images together in a sequence, you can observe how dynamically the dust devils move across the surface."" (see the images on the website of the University of Bern) Winds on Mars stronger than previously assumed The results show that the dust devils and the winds surrounding them on Mars can reach speeds of up to 44 m/s, i.e. around 160 km/h, across the entire planet, which is much faster than previously assumed (previous measurements on the surface had shown that winds mostly remain below 50 km/h and - in rare cases - can reach a maximum of 100 km/h). The high wind speed in turn influences the dust cycle on the Red Planet: ""These strong, straight-line winds are very likely to bring a considerable amount of dust into the Martian atmosphere - much more than previously assumed,"" says Bickel. He continues: ""Our data show where and when the winds on Mars seem to be strong enough to lift dust from the surface. This is the first time that such findings are available on a global scale for a period of around two decades."" Future Mars missions can benefit from the research results The results obtained are also particularly important for future Mars missions. ""A better understanding of the wind conditions on Mars is crucial for the planning and execution of future landed missions,"" explains Daniela Tirsch from the Institute of Space Research at the German Aerospace Center (DLR) and co-author of the study. ""With the help of the new findings on wind dynamics, we can model the Martian atmosphere and the associated surface processes more precisely,"" Tirsch continues. These models are essential to better assess risks for future missions and adapt technical systems accordingly. The new study thus provides important findings for a number of research areas on Mars, such as research into the formation of dunes and slope streaks, as well as the creation of weather and climate models of Mars. The researchers plan to further intensify the observations of dust devils and supplement the data obtained with targeted and coordinated observations of dust devils using CaSSIS and HRSC. ""In the long term, our research should help to make the planning of Mars missions more efficient,"" concludes Bickel.",https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/10/251009033215.htm,Science,BBC,,https://www.sciencedaily.com/images/1920/dust-devil-on-mars.webp,,4ddb61c0527a1c368172d428b78e63612c9cff1e
92ef8439cfb0,Scientists unlock nature’s secret to a cancer-fighting molecule,pharmaceuticals; workplace health; diseases and conditions; pharmacology; new species; food; cats; biotechnology and bioengineering,"Scientists at UBC Okanagan have discovered how plants create mitraphylline, a rare natural substance with potential anti-cancer properties. Mitraphylline is part of a small family of plant-derived molecules known as spirooxindole alkaloids. These compounds feature unique, “twisted” ring-like chemical structures and are recognized for their strong biological effects, including anti-tumor and anti-inflammatory activity. Until recently, researchers did not understand the precise molecular process plants use to form spirooxindoles. That changed in 2023 when Dr. Thu-Thuy Dang and her team in the Irving K. Barber Faculty of Science identified the first plant enzyme capable of twisting a molecule into the distinctive spiro shape. Building on that milestone, doctoral student Tuan-Anh Nguyen led the next phase of research and uncovered two enzymes that work together: one determines the molecule’s 3D arrangement, and the other completes the final twist that forms mitraphylline. ""This is similar to finding the missing links in an assembly line,"" says Dr. Dang, UBC Okanagan Principal's Research Chair in Natural Products Biotechnology. ""It answers a long-standing question about how nature builds these complex molecules and gives us a new way to replicate that process."" Because natural compounds often exist in only tiny quantities, they can be difficult and expensive to produce in the laboratory. Mitraphylline is one such compound, found in trace amounts in tropical trees like Mitragyna (kratom) and Uncaria (cat’s claw), both members of the coffee family. By identifying the enzymes responsible for assembling and shaping mitraphylline, the researchers have established a framework for producing this and related compounds more efficiently and sustainably. ""With this discovery, we have a green chemistry approach to accessing compounds with enormous pharmaceutical value,"" says Nguyen. ""This is a result of UBC Okanagan's research environment, where students and faculty work closely to solve problems with global reach."" ""Being part of the team that uncovered the enzymes behind spirooxindole compounds has been amazing,"" Nguyen adds. ""UBC Okanagan's mentorship and support made this possible, and I'm excited to keep growing as a researcher here in Canada."" The project is the result of collaboration between Dr. Dang's lab at UBC Okanagan and Dr. Satya Nadakuduti's team at the University of Florida. The work was supported by Canada's Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council's Alliance International Collaboration program, the Canada Foundation for Innovation, and the Michael Smith Health Research BC Scholar Program. Support also came from the United States Department of Agriculture's National Institute of Food and Agriculture. ""We are proud of this discovery coming from UBC Okanagan. Plants are fantastic natural chemists,"" she says.

7bb070043aec,Scientists discover brain circuit that can switch off chronic pain,heart disease; fitness; pharmacology; diseases and conditions; behavior; spirituality; memory; neuroscience,"Pain may be unpleasant, but in most cases it plays a vital, even lifesaving, role. Short bursts of pain act as warning signals that protect us from harm. When you touch a hot pan, stub your toe, or bump your head, your nervous system instantly delivers an “Ow!” that prompts you to pull back before more damage occurs. The pain fades, the body heals, and you remember what not to do next time. Chronic pain, however, is an entirely different story. In this condition, the warning signal doesn’t stop even after the injury has healed. For about 50 million people in the United States, pain becomes a constant, invisible companion that can persist for years or even decades. ""It's not just an injury that won't heal,"" explains neuroscientist at the University of Pennsylvania J. Nicholas Betley, ""it's a brain input that's become sensitized and hyperactive, and determining how to quiet that input could lead to better treatments."" Betley, along with collaborators from the University of Pittsburgh and Scripps Research Institute, has discovered an important piece of the chronic pain puzzle. Their research points to a specific group of brainstem cells called Y1 receptor (Y1R)-expressing neurons, located in the lateral parabrachial nucleus (lPBN). These neurons are activated in persistent pain states, but they also process signals related to hunger, fear, and thirst. This suggests that the brain can adjust pain responses when other, more urgent needs demand attention. The findings, published in Nature , indicate that relief may be possible because, as the researchers write, ""there are circuits in the brain that can reduce the activity of neurons that transmit the signal of pain."" Tracking pain in the brain Working with the Taylor lab at the University of Pittsburgh, Betley’s team used calcium imaging to visualize neuron activity in real time in animal models of both short-term and long-term pain. They observed that Y1R neurons did not simply react to quick bursts of pain; instead, they kept firing steadily during prolonged pain, a phenomenon known as “tonic activity.” Betley compares this to an engine left running even after you’ve parked the car. The pain signals continue to hum in the background even when physical recovery seems complete. This ongoing neural activity may explain why some people continue to feel pain long after an injury or surgery. The research originated from an unexpected observation Betley made after joining Penn in 2015: hunger seemed to lessen chronic pain. ""From my own experience, I felt that when you're really hungry you'll do almost anything to get food,"" he says. ""When it came to chronic, lingering pain, hunger seemed to be more powerful than Advil at reducing pain."" That insight inspired further investigation. Former graduate student Nitsan Goldstein found that other critical survival states—such as thirst and fear—can also suppress long-term pain. In collaboration with the Kennedy lab at Scripps, the team showed that the brain’s parabrachial nucleus can filter sensory input to quiet pain when immediate survival takes priority. ""That told us the brain must have a built-in way of prioritizing urgent survival needs over pain, and we wanted to find the neurons responsible for that switch,"" says Goldstein. A key part of that switch is neuropeptide Y (NPY), a signaling molecule that helps the brain juggle competing needs. When hunger or fear takes priority, NPY acts on Y1 receptors in the parabrachial nucleus to dampen ongoing pain signals. ""It's like the brain has this built-in override switch,"" Goldstein explains. ""If you're starving or facing a predator, you can't afford to be overwhelmed by lingering pain. Neurons activated by these other threats release NPY, and NPY quiets the pain signal so that other survival needs take precedence."" A scattered signal The researchers also characterized the molecular and anatomical identity of the Y1R neurons in the lPBN. They found that Y1Rneurons didn't form two tidy anatomical or molecular populations. Instead, these neurons were scattered across many other cell types. ""It's like looking at cars in a parking lot,"" Betley says. ""We expected all the Y1R neurons to be a cluster of yellow cars parked together, but here the Y1R neurons are like yellow paint distributed across red cars, blue cars, and green cars. We don't know exactly why , but we think this mosaic distribution may allow the brain to dampen different kinds of painful inputs across multiple circuits."" Explorations of pain treatment What excites Betley with this discovery is the further exploration of its potential to ""use Y1 neural activity as a biomarker for chronic pain, something drug developers and clinicians have long lacked,"" he says. ""Right now, patients may go to an orthopedist or a neurologist, and there is no clear injury. But they're still in pain,"" he says. ""What we're showing is that the problem may not be in the nerves at the site of injury, but in the brain circuit itself. If we can target these neurons, that opens up a whole new path for treatment."" This research also suggests that behavioral interventions such as exercise, meditation, and cognitive behavioral therapy may influence how these brain circuits fire, just as hunger and fear did in the lab. ""We've shown that this circuit is flexible, it can be dialed up or down,"" he says. ""So, the future isn't just about designing a pill. It's also about asking how behavior, training, and lifestyle can change the way these neurons encode pain.""

420b160c1674,"Scientists suggest the brain may work best with 7 senses, not just 5",workplace health; multiple sclerosis research; pharmacology; language acquisition; spirituality; perception; computer modeling; neural interfaces; robotics,"Researchers at Skoltech have developed a mathematical model that explores how memory functions. When they analyzed this model, they discovered intriguing results that could help improve robotic systems, artificial intelligence, and our understanding of how the human mind stores information. The findings, published in Scientific Reports , suggest there might be an ideal number of senses—and if that’s true, our five senses might not be enough! ""Our conclusion is of course highly speculative in application to human senses, although you never know: It could be that humans of the future would evolve a sense of radiation or magnetic field. But in any case, our findings may be of practical importance for robotics and the theory of artificial intelligence,"" said study co-author Professor Nikolay Brilliantov of Skoltech AI. ""It appears that when each concept retained in memory is characterized in terms of seven features—as opposed to, say, five or eight—the number of distinct objects held in memory is maximized."" Following a research tradition that began in the early 20th century, the team focused on modeling the basic units of memory known as “engrams.” An engram can be thought of as a sparse collection of neurons in different brain regions that fire together. Each engram represents a concept, described through a set of features. For humans, these features correspond to sensory experiences—for example, the concept of a banana includes its appearance, smell, taste, and other sensory qualities. In this framework, the banana becomes a five-dimensional object within a mental space containing all the other memories stored in the brain. Engrams evolve over time, becoming sharper or more diffuse depending on how often they are triggered by sensory input from the outside world. This process represents how we learn and forget as we interact with our environment. ""We have mathematically demonstrated that the engrams in the conceptual space tend to evolve toward a steady state, which means that after some transient period, a 'mature' distribution of engrams emerges, which then persists in time,"" Brilliantov commented. ""As we consider the ultimate capacity of a conceptual space of a given number of dimensions, we somewhat surprisingly find that the number of distinct engrams stored in memory in the steady state is the greatest for a concept space of seven dimensions. Hence the seven senses claim."" In other words, let the objects that exist out there in the world be described by a finite number of features corresponding to the dimensions of some conceptual space. Suppose that we want to maximize the capacity of the conceptual space expressed as the number of distinct concepts associated with these objects. The greater the capacity of the conceptual space, the deeper the overall understanding of the world. It turns out that the maximum is attained when the dimension of the conceptual space is seven. From this the researchers conclude that seven is the optimal number of senses. According to the researchers, this number does not depend on the details of the model -- the properties of the conceptual space and the stimuli providing the sense impressions. The number seven appears to be a robust and persistent feature of memory engrams as such. One caveat is that multiple engrams of differing sizes existing around a common center are deemed to represent similar concepts and are therefore treated as one when calculating memory capacity. The memory of humans and other living beings is an enigmatic phenomenon tied to the property of consciousness, among other things. Advancing the theoretical models of memory will be instrumental to gaining new insights into the human mind and recreating humanlike memory in AI agents.",https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/10/251008030955.htm,Science,BBC,,https://www.sciencedaily.com/images/1920/rainbow-color-brain-regions.webp,,cfd5066590cc2ffe62ca9f6aadcca58a59e74e36
6d691a379f71,Scientists just found a molecule that could stop Parkinson’s in its tracks,pharmacology; healthy aging; alzheimer&amp;#039;s research; pharmaceuticals; brain injury; alzheimer&amp;#039;s; dementia; borderline personality disorder,"Scientists from the University of Bath, working together with researchers at the Universities of Oxford and Bristol, have created a molecule that stops a key protein linked to Parkinson’s disease and certain dementias from clumping together. The research team has shown that this molecule works in an animal model of Parkinson’s and believes it could one day form the basis of a treatment that slows the disease’s progression. Alpha-synuclein is a protein found mainly inside brain cells (neurons), where it helps control the release of neurotransmitters such as dopamine, the chemical that allows neurons to communicate with each other. In Parkinson’s disease, alpha-synuclein begins to stick together, forming toxic clusters that kill nerve cells. This cell loss leads to the hallmark symptoms of Parkinson’s, including tremors, muscle stiffness, and difficulty with movement. Although existing therapies can ease these symptoms, none currently stop or reverse the underlying damage. In its normal or ""native state,"" alpha-synuclein is a flexible strand, but when it becomes active it folds into a helix. This shape is crucial for its role in carrying and delivering dopamine within the brain. The researchers designed a short peptide that locks alpha-synuclein into its healthy helical shape, preventing it from transforming into the harmful clusters that cause cell death. Lab experiments revealed that the peptide remains stable, can enter brain-like cells, and reduces the buildup of toxic protein deposits while improving movement in a worm model of Parkinson’s disease. Published in the journal JACS Au , the study highlights how rational peptide design can turn large, unstable proteins into smaller, more drug-like molecules. The findings mark a significant step towards developing new peptide-based treatments for currently untreatable neurodegenerative conditions. Professor Jody Mason, from the Department of Life Sciences at the University of Bath, said: ""Our work shows that it is possible to rationally design small peptides that not only prevent harmful protein aggregation but also function inside living systems. ""This opens an exciting path towards new therapies for Parkinson's and related diseases, where treatment options remain extremely limited."" Dr. Julia Dudley, Head of Research at Alzheimer's Research UK, which funded the research, said: ""Dementia isn't an inevitable part of ageing; it's caused by diseases like Alzheimer's. To make progress towards a cure for all forms of dementia, we need research focused on developing a broad range of treatments that can slow, stop and ultimately reverse these diseases. ""Although this is early research in an animal model, it's exciting to see that this new molecule can prevent the build-up of misfolded alpha-synuclein. ""By stabilizing alpha-synuclein in its healthy form, this could open the door to a new class of treatments that could slow progression in diseases like Parkinson's and dementia with Lewy bodies. We look forward to seeing this research taken to the next stage, potentially exploring how it would work in people. ""We're delighted to see such promising advances from Alzheimer's Research UK funded work opening up new avenues for treatments of the future, and the potential to change the lives of those affected by neurodegenerative diseases."" Further research is needed, but the team hopes that continued progress will enable these and similar molecules to advance towards clinical testing in the coming years.",https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/10/251008030949.htm,Science,BBC,,https://www.sciencedaily.com/images/1920/overworked-neuron-brain-cell.webp,,b651ab509cb46988596aabacd617e4a8d9c4a718

Both were described using specimens collected during a 2022 research voyage aboard the CSIRO vessel (RV) Investigator. The discoveries, named the West Australian Lanternshark and a porcelain crab, were announced in separate scientific papers published in September 2025. Meet the West Australian Lanternshark Etmopterus westraliensis Ichthyologist Dr. Will White from the CSIRO Australian National Fish Collection helped describe this newly discovered shark. ""Lanternsharks are an amazing group of sharks, and this new species was found at depths to 610 meters during biodiversity surveys for Parks Australia in the Gascoyne Marine Park area off Western Australia,"" Dr White said. The West Australian Lanternshark is relatively small, with the largest specimen measuring just 407 millimeters long. Its large eyes are adapted for the dark depths of the ocean, and its slim body is equipped with two small dorsal (topside) fins, each featuring a sharp spine. Among the shark’s most extraordinary features is its ability to glow. ""Lanternsharks are bioluminescent, with light produced by photophores located on their belly and flanks, which is where their common name comes from,"" Dr White said. The species name E. westraliensis honors Western Australia, the region where it was discovered. It is the third shark species identified from specimens collected during the same 2022 voyage, following the Painted Hornshark and Ridged-egg Catshark, both revealed in 2023. Meet the new porcelain crab Porcellanella brevidentata Dr. Andrew Hosie, Curator of Aquatic Zoology at the Western Australian Museum, participated in describing this newly identified crab species. ""The new species of porcelain crab lives a symbiotic life with sea pens, which are a group of soft corals related to sea fans, where they will hide among the 'leaves' of the host,"" Dr Hosie said. The crab is small, being around 15 millimeters in length, and is opalescent white-yellow in color. This makes it well-adapted to hide within the white leaves of its sea pen host. The new crab was found during surveys along the Ningaloo coast at depths to 122 meters. ""Porcelain crabs are known as filter feeders, feeding on plankton by using modified mouthparts with long hairs to sweep the water for small pieces of food such as plankton, rather than the typical crab method of grabbing and pinching food with their claws,"" Dr Hosie said. Additional specimens used to identify and describe the new species of porcelain crab were collected during another CSIRO-led RV Investigator voyage in 2017. A bounty of new life Nearly 20 new species have now been described with the help of specimens collected on the 2022 voyage, including the Carnarvon Flapjack Octopus announced earlier in 2025. Incredibly, researchers estimate that there are potentially up to 600 new species still waiting to be described from the voyage. The deep-sea is still largely unexplored and biodiversity surveys of these habitats are vital to increase our understanding of the incredible marine life that dwells in the depths of our oceans. Researchers expect to discover more species new to science during an upcoming CSIRO-led voyage on RV Investigator to survey the deep-sea biodiversity of the Coral Sea Marine Park for Parks Australia. The voyage brings together many of the same researchers from the 2022 voyage, along with new collaborators and partners, to again turn wonder into discovery. RV Investigator is part of the Marine National Facility, national collaborative research infrastructure funded by the Australian Government and operated by CSIRO, Australia's national science agency, on behalf of the nation. Key points Two species new to science have been discovered in the deep-sea  off Western Australia: the West Australian Lanternshark and a porcelain  crab.

4ec4587e63de,"Scientists just proved the moai could walk, solving a 500-year mystery",ancient civilizations; cultures; lost treasures; early climate; energy issues; transportation issues; travel and recreation; stem education,"For generations, scientists have wondered how the ancient people of Rapa Nui managed to transport the massive moai statues scattered across Easter Island. Now, using a mix of physics, 3D modeling, and hands-on testing, a research team that includes faculty from Binghamton University (State University of New York) has confirmed that the statues could quite literally “walk” with the help of ropes and surprisingly few people. After studying nearly 1,000 of the stone figures, Binghamton University anthropologist Carl Lipo and University of Arizona researcher Terry Hunt determined that the island’s inhabitants probably used ropes to rock the statues side to side, allowing them to “walk” forward in a zigzag motion along carefully constructed paths. Lipo and his colleagues had previously shown through experiments that the towering statues could move upright by rocking back and forth, contradicting older theories that suggested they were hauled lying flat on wooden sleds. ""Once you get it moving, it isn't hard at all - people are pulling with one arm. It conserves energy, and it moves really quickly,"" said Lipo. ""The hard part is getting it rocking in the first place. The question is, if it's really large, what would it take? Are the things that we saw experimentally consistent with what we would expect from a physics perspective?"" To test whether larger statues could move the same way, the researchers built detailed 3D models of the moai. They found specific design features—broad D-shaped bases and a slight forward tilt—that would make the statues easier to rock and maneuver in a walking pattern. Putting the theory into practice, the team constructed a 4.35-ton replica moai with the characteristic forward-leaning design. Using only 18 people, they successfully moved the statue 100 meters in about 40 minutes, far outperforming earlier vertical transport attempts. ""The physics makes sense,"" said Lipo. ""What we saw experimentally actually works. And as it gets bigger, it still works. All the attributes that we see about moving gigantic ones only get more and more consistent the bigger and bigger they get, because it becomes the only way you could move it."" Further evidence supporting the theory comes from Rapa Nui’s network of ancient roads. Measuring roughly 4.5 meters across and shaped with a gentle inward curve, these routes appear to have been perfectly suited for stabilizing the walking statues as they advanced. ""Every time they're moving a statue, it looks like they're making a road. The road is part of moving the statue,"" said Lipo. ""We actually see them overlapping each other, and many parallel versions of them. What they are probably doing is clearing a path, moving it, clearing another, clearing it further, and moving it right in certain sequences. So they're spending a lot of time on the road part."" Lipo said that nothing else currently explains how the moai were moved. The challenge to anyone else is to prove them wrong. ""Find some evidence that shows it couldn't be walking. Because nothing we've seen anywhere disproves that,"" said Lipo. ""In fact, everything we ever see and ever thought of keeps strengthening the argument."" Lipo said Rapa Nui is notorious for wild theories backed by zero evidence. This research is an example of putting a theory to the test. ""People have spun all kinds of tales about stuff that's plausible or possible in some way, but they never go about evaluating the evidence to show that, in fact, you can learn about the past and explain the record that you see in ways that are fully scientific,"" said Lipo. ""One of the steps is simply saying, ""Look, we can build an answer here."" Lipo said that the research also honors the people of Rapa Nui, who achieved a monumental engineering feat with limited resources. ""It shows that the Rapa Nui people were incredibly smart. They figured this out,"" said Lipo. ""They're doing it the way that's consistent with the resources they have. So it really gives honor to those people, saying, look at what they were able to achieve, and we have a lot to learn from them in these principles.""

This sparkling spiral galaxy is called NGC 6000 and it is located 102 million light-years away in the constellation Scorpius. This galaxy has a glowing yellow center and glittering blue outskirts. The colors reflect differences in the average ages, masses and temperatures of the galaxy's stars. In the heart of the galaxy, the stars tend to be older and smaller. Less massive stars are cooler than more massive stars, and somewhat counterintuitively, cooler stars are redder, while hotter stars are bluer. Farther out along NGC 6000's spiral arms, brilliant star clusters host young, massive stars that appear distinctly blue. Hubble collected the data for this image while surveying the sites of recent supernova explosions in nearby galaxies. NGC 6000 has hosted two recent supernovae: SN 2007ch in 2007 and SN 2010as in 2010. Using Hubble's sensitive detectors, researchers are able to discern the faint glow of supernovae years after the initial explosion. These observations help to constrain the masses of supernova progenitor stars and can indicate if they had any stellar companions. By zooming in to the right side of the galaxy's disc in this image, you may see something else yellow and blue: a set of four thin lines. These are an asteroid in our Solar System, which was drifting across Hubble's field of view as it gazed at NGC 6000. The four streaks are due to different exposures that were recorded one after another with slight pauses in between. These were combined to create this final image. The colors appear this way because each exposure used a filter to collect only very specific wavelengths of light, in this case around red and blue. Having these separate exposures is important to study and compare stars by their colors -- but it also makes asteroid interlopers very obvious!",https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/10/251007234522.htm,Science,BBC,,https://www.sciencedaily.com/images/1920/ngc-6000.webp,,44aa36ec2fac1c89b1e23f3bc36ac03f7e953496

It works,physics; detectors; quantum physics; nanotechnology; computers and internet; communications; computer programming; computer science,"Can you prove whether a large quantum system truly behaves according to the weird and wonderful rules of quantum mechanics -- or if it just looks like it does? In a groundbreaking study, physicists from Leiden, Beijing en Hangzhou found the answer to this question. You could call it a 'quantum lie detector': Bell's test designed by famous physicist John Bell. This test shows whether a machine, like a quantum computer, is truly using quantum effects or just mimics them. As quantum technologies become more mature, ever more stringent tests of quantumness become necessary. In this new study, the researchers took things to the next level, testing Bell correlations in systems with up to 73 qubits -- the basic building blocks of a quantum computer. The study involved a global team: theoretical physicists Jordi Tura, Patrick Emonts, PhD candidate Mengyao Hu from Leiden University, together with colleagues from Tsinghua University (Beijing) and experimental physicists from Zhejiang University (Hangzhou). The world of quantum physics Quantum mechanics is the science that explains how the tiniest particles in the universe -- like atoms and electrons -- behave. It's a world full of strange and counterintuitive ideas. One of those is quantum nonlocality, where particles appear to instantly affect each other, even when far apart. Although it sounds strange, it's a real effect, and it won the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2022. This research is focused on proving the occurrence of nonlocal correlation, also known as Bell correlations. Clever experimenting It was an extremely ambitious plan, but the team's well-optimized strategy made all the difference. Instead of trying to directly measure the complex Bell correlations, they focused on something quantum devices are already good at: minimizing energy. And it paid off. The team created a special quantum state using 73 qubits in a superconducting quantum processor and measured energies far below what would be possible in a classical system. The difference was striking -- 48 standard deviations -- making it almost impossible that the result was due to chance. But the team didn't stop there. They went on to certify a rare and more demanding type of nonlocality - known as genuine multipartite Bell correlations. In this kind of quantum correlation, all qubits in the system must be involved, making it much harder to generate -- and even harder to verify. Remarkably, the researchers succeeded in preparing a whole series of low-energy states that passed this test up to 24 qubits, confirming these special correlations efficiently. This result shows that quantum computers are not just getting bigger -- they are also becoming better at displaying and proving truly quantum behaviour. Why this matters This study proves that it's possible to certify deep quantum behaviour in large, complex systems -- something never done at this scale before. It's a big step toward making sure quantum computers are truly quantum. These insights are more than just theoretical. Understanding and controlling Bell correlations could improve quantum communication, make cryptography more secure, and help develop new quantum algorithms.",https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/10/251007081840.htm,Science,BBC,,https://www.sciencedaily.com/images/1920/futuristic-quantum-computer-system-glowing.webp,,a77737d61bf52e20109153a94d2c5f0681170804

Most people are familiar with the microbes on our skin or in our gut, but recent discoveries have revealed that tumors also host unique communities of bacteria. Scientists are now investigating how these tumor-associated bacteria can affect tumor growth and the response to chemotherapy. New research, published online in Cell Systems on September 10, 2025, provides a significant breakthrough in this field, identifying a powerful anti-cancer metabolite produced by bacteria associated with colorectal cancer. This finding opens the door to new strategies for treating cancer, including the development of novel drugs that could make existing therapies more potent. The researchers used a sophisticated large-scale screening approach to test over 1,100 conditions in a type of microscopic worm called C. elegans . Through this, they found that the bacteria E. coli produced a molecule called 2-methylisocitrate (2-MiCit) that could improve the effectiveness of the chemotherapy drug 5-fluorouracil (5-FU). Using computer modelling, the team demonstrated that the tumor-associated microbiome (bacteria found within and around tumors) from patients was also able to produce 2-MiCit. To confirm the effectiveness of 2-MiCit, the team used two further systems; human cancer cells and a fly model of colorectal cancer. In both cases, they found that 2-MiCit showed potent anti-cancer properties, and for the flies could extend survival. Professor Filipe Cabreiro, head of the Host-Microbe Co-Metabolism group at the LMS, and group leader at the CECAD Research Cluster in Cologne, explains the significance of the discovery: ""We've known that bacteria are associated with tumors, and now we're starting to understand the chemical conversation they're having with cancer cells. We found that one of these bacterial chemicals can act as a powerful partner for chemotherapy, disrupting the metabolism of cancer cells and making them more vulnerable to the drug."" The study revealed that 2-MiCit works by inhibiting a key enzyme in the mitochondria (structures inside cells that generate energy for cellular functions) of cancer cells. This leads to DNA damage and activates pathways known to reduce the progression of cancer. This multi-pronged attack weakens the cancer cells and works in synergy with 5-FU. The combination was significantly more effective at killing cancer cells than either compound alone. Dr Daniel Martinez-Martinez, postdoctoral researcher at the LMS and first author of the paper, says: ""Microbes are an essential part of us. That a single molecule can exert such a profound impact on cancer progression is truly remarkable, and another piece of evidence on how complex biology can be when considering it from a holistic point of view. It is really exciting because we are only scratching the surface of what is really happening."" In collaboration with medicinal chemists, the researchers also modified the 2-MiCit compound to enhance its effectiveness. This synthetic version proved even more powerful at killing cancer cells, demonstrating the potential to develop new drugs based on natural microbial products. Filipe adds: ""Using the natural microbial product as a starting point, we were able to design a more potent molecule, effectively improving on mother nature."" These exciting discoveries highlight how the cancer-associated microbiome can impact tumor progression, and how metabolites produced by these bacteria could be harnessed to improve cancer treatments. These findings are also important in the context of personalized medicine, emphasizing the importance of considering not only the patient, but also their microbes. This study was primarily funded by the Leverhulme Trust, the Wellcome Trust/Royal Society, the DFG German Research Foundation, and the Medical Research Council.",https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/10/251007081835.htm,Science,BBC,,https://www.sciencedaily.com/images/1920/cancer-tumor-cell-destruction-nanoparticles.webp,,fc5fd9c26e07bd046a0aa84b11b3cfe456431b6a
24eed22e3375,The Red Sea that vanished and the catastrophic flood that brought it back,ecology research; extinction; extreme survival; nature; ecology; global warming; natural disasters; environmental issues,"Scientists at King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST) have provided conclusive evidence that the Red Sea completely dried out about 6.2 million years ago, before being suddenly refilled by a catastrophic flood from the Indian Ocean. The findings put a definitive time on a dramatic event that changed the Red Sea. Using seismic imaging, microfossil evidence, and geochemical dating techniques, the KAUST researchers showed that a massive change happened in about 100,000 years - a blink of an eye for a major geological event. The Red Sea went from connecting with the Mediterranean Sea to an empty, salt-filled basin. Then, a massive flood burst through volcanic barriers to open the Bab el-Mandab strait and reconnect the Red Sea with the world's oceans. ""Our findings show that the Red Sea basin records one of the most extreme environmental events on Earth, when it dried out completely and was then suddenly reflooded about 6.2 million years ago,"" said lead author Dr. Tihana Pensa of KAUST. ""The flood transformed the basin, restored marine conditions, and established the Red Sea's lasting connection to the Indian Ocean."" How the Indian Ocean Flooded the Red Sea The Red Sea was initially connected from the north to the Mediterranean through a shallow sill. This connection was severed, drying the Red Sea into a barren salt desert. In the south of the Red Sea, near the Hanish Islands, a volcanic ridge separated the sea from the Indian Ocean. But around 6.2 million years ago, seawater from the Indian Ocean surged across this barrier in a catastrophic flood. The torrent carved a 320-kilometer-long submarine canyon that is still visible today on the seafloor. The flood rapidly refilled the basin, drowning the salt flats and restoring normal marine conditions in less than 100,000 years. This event happened nearly a million years before the Mediterranean was refilled by the famous Zanclean flood, giving the Red Sea a unique story of rebirth. Why the Red Sea Matters Geologically The Red Sea formed by separation of the Arabian Plate from the African Plate beginning 30 million years ago. Initially, the sea was a narrow rift valley filled with lakes, then became a wider gulf when it was flooded from the Mediterranean 23 million years ago. Marine life thrived initially, as seen by the fossil reefs along the northern coast near Duba and Umlujj. However, evaporation and poor seawater circulation increased salinity, causing the extinction of marine life between 15 and 6 million years ago. Additionally, the basin was filled with layers of salt and gypsum. This culminated in complete desiccation of the Red Sea. The catastrophic flood from the Indian Ocean restored marine life in the Red, which persists in the coral reefs to the present. All in all, the Red Sea is a natural laboratory for understanding how oceans are born, how salt giants accumulate, and how climate and tectonics interact over millions of years. The discovery highlights how closely the Red Sea's history is linked with global ocean change. It also shows that the region has experienced environmental extremes before, only to return as a thriving marine ecosystem. ""This paper adds to our knowledge about the processes that form and expand oceans on Earth. It also maintains KAUST's leading position in Red Sea research,"" said co-author KAUST Professor Abdulkader Al Afifi.",https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/10/251007081831.htm,Science,BBC,,https://www.sciencedaily.com/images/1920/aerial-view-of-nile-river-red-sea-mediterranean-sea.webp,,5a212dd7ce331e5c9a741f3738db499e0aa1189c
260b4d9dc009,Scientists uncover a hidden power source inside a monster black hole,black holes; galaxies; space telescopes; space exploration; cosmic rays; stars; solar flare; sun,"A hundred years before the Event Horizon Telescope Collaboration released the first image of a black hole in 2019 – located at the heart of the galaxy M87 – astronomer Heber Curtis had already discovered a strange jet protruding from the galaxy’s center. Today, we know this to be the jet of the black hole M87*. Such jets are also emitted by other black holes. Theoretical astrophysicists at Goethe University have now developed a numerical code to describe with high mathematical precision how black holes transform their rotational energy into such ultra-fast jets. For nearly two centuries, it was unclear that the bright spot in the constellation Virgo, which Charles Messier had described in 1781 as ""87: Nebula without stars,"" was in fact a very large galaxy. As a result, there was initially no explanation for the strange jet discovered in 1918 emerging from the center of this ""nebula."" At the heart of the giant galaxy M87 lies the black hole M87*, which contains a staggering six and a half billion solar masses and spins rapidly on its axis. Using the energy from this rotation, M87* powers a particle jet expelled at nearly the speed of light, stretching across an immense 5,000 light-years. Such jets are also generated by other rotating black holes. They contribute to disperse energy and matter throughout the universe and can influence the evolution of entire galaxies. A team of astrophysicists at Goethe University Frankfurt, led by Prof. Luciano Rezzolla, has developed a numerical code, named the Frankfurt particle-in-cell code for black hole spacetimes (FPIC), which describes with high precision the processes that convert rotational energy into a particle jet. The result: In addition to the Blandford-Znajek mechanism - which has so far been considered responsible for the extraction of rotational energy from the black hole via strong magnetic fields - the scientists have revealed that another process is involved in the energy extraction, namely, magnetic reconnection. In this process, magnetic field lines break and reassemble, leading to magnetic energy being converted into heat, radiation, and eruptions of plasma. The FPIC code simulated the evolution of a vast number of charged particles and extreme electromagnetic fields under the influence of the black hole's strong gravity. Dr. Claudio Meringolo, the main developer of the code, explains: ""Simulating such processes is crucial for understanding the complex dynamics of relativistic plasmas in curved spacetimes near compact objects, which are governed by the interplay of extreme gravitational and magnetic fields."" The investigations required highly demanding supercomputer simulations that consumed millions of CPU hours on Frankfurt's ""Goethe"" supercomputer and Stuttgart's ""Hawk."" This large computing power was essential to solve Maxwell's equations and the equations of motion for electrons and positrons according to Albert Einstein's theory of general relativity. In the equatorial plane of the black hole, the researchers' calculations revealed intense reconnection activity, leading to the formation of a chain of plasmoids - a condensation of plasma in energetic ""bubbles"" - moving at nearly the speed of light. According to the scientists, this process is accompanied by the generation of particles with negative energy that is used to power extreme astrophysical phenomena like jets and plasma eruptions. ""Our results open up the fascinating possibility that the Blandford-Znajek mechanism is not the only astrophysical process capable of extracting rotational energy from a black hole,"" says Dr. Filippo Camilloni, who also worked on the FPIC project, ""but that magnetic reconnection also contributes."" ""With our work, we can demonstrate how energy is efficiently extracted from rotating black holes and channeled into jets,"" says Rezzolla. ""This allows us to help explain the extreme luminosities of active galactic nuclei as well as the acceleration of particles to nearly the speed of light."" He adds that it is incredibly exciting and fascinating to better understand what happens near a black hole using sophisticated numerical codes. ""At the same time, it is even more rewarding to be able to explain the results of these complex simulations with a rigorous mathematical treatment -- as we have done in our work.""",https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/10/251007081827.htm,Science,BBC,,https://www.sciencedaily.com/images/1920/plasmoids-near-black-hole.webp,,3ef84674223238162ae2a0f215959be537b0c103
9f46f29ee135,Gaia solves the mystery of tumbling asteroids and reveals what’s inside them,"space exploration; nasa; asteroids, comets and meteors; space missions; sun; space station; space telescopes; solar system","Whether an asteroid spins smoothly or tumbles erratically depends largely on how often it has been struck by other objects in space. New research presented at the EPSC-DPS2025 Joint Meeting in Helsinki, using data from the European Space Agency's Gaia mission, has revealed this link. The results also offer a way to better understand the physical makeup of asteroids, knowledge that could be crucial if one were ever found to be on a collision path with Earth. ""By leveraging Gaia's unique dataset, advanced modelling and A.I. tools, we've revealed the hidden physics shaping asteroid rotation, and opened a new window into the interiors of these ancient worlds,"" said Dr Wen-Han Zhou of the University of Tokyo, who presented the results at EPSC-DPS2025. Gaia’s all-sky survey created an enormous database of asteroid rotation patterns derived from light curves, which record how an asteroid’s brightness changes as it spins. When researchers plotted these data against asteroid size, an unexpected feature appeared: a clear gap dividing two groups of asteroids. A team led by Zhou, who carried out much of the work at the Observatoire de la Côte d'Azur in France, has now identified the cause of this separation and resolved several long-standing questions about how asteroids rotate. ""We built a new model of asteroid-spin evolution that considers the tug of war between two key processes, namely collisions in the Asteroid Belt that can jolt asteroids into a tumbling state, and internal friction, which gradually smooths their spin back to a stable rotation,"" said Zhou. ""When these two effects balance, they create a natural dividing line in the asteroid population."" Using machine learning to analyze Gaia’s asteroid catalog and compare it with their theoretical model, Zhou’s group found that the observed gap aligned almost exactly with the model’s predictions. Asteroids below the gap are slow, irregular tumblers with rotation periods under 30 hours, while those above it are faster, steadily spinning bodies. For decades, scientists have wondered why so many asteroids tumble instead of spinning neatly on a single axis, and why smaller asteroids are especially prone to slow, chaotic motion. Zhou’s research shows that both impacts and sunlight play major roles. Tumbling tends to begin when an asteroid is already rotating slowly, making it more susceptible to being knocked off balance by collisions. Ordinarily, the subtle force of sunlight would be expected to cause the asteroid to stop tumbling and spin up. The surface of an asteroid absorbs heat from the Sun and re-emits it in different directions. The emitted photons give the asteroid a tiny push, one that builds up over time, and depending on the asteroid can either speed up its rotation or slow it down. For an asteroid that is spinning smoothly on its axis, the directions in which sunlight is absorbed and re-emitted remains constant, allowing the strength of the push from sunlight to build up. However, for tumbling asteroids the effect of sunlight is much weaker. Because they are rotating chaotically, different parts of the surface are absorbing and re-emitting heat at any given time. Rather than giving the asteroid a consistent push, the effect of absorbing and re-emitting sunlight is smoothed out, so there's no preferred push in any direction. As a result, slowly tumbling asteroids change their spin very slowly, and become stuck in the slow-rotation zone below the gap in the observational data from Gaia. There's a practical usefulness to this discovery. By understanding how the rigidity of asteroids' interior structure relates to their rotation, it's possible to use that knowledge to infer the internal properties of the asteroids. From the Gaia data, the findings support the picture of asteroids as loosely held together rubble piles, with lots of holes and cavities blanketed in thick, dusty regolith. Understanding the properties of asteroids also has repercussions for how to deflect a hazardous asteroid on a collision course, because a rubble pile asteroid would react to a kinetic impact like NASA's DART differently than a solid, rigid body. Thanks to these findings, astronomers could soon have an extensive catalogue of the internal structures of potentially hazardous asteroids, which could hold the key of how to deflect them. ""With forthcoming surveys like the Vera C. Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST), we'll be able to apply this method to millions more asteroids, refining our understanding of their evolution and make-up,"" said Zhou.",https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/10/251007081825.htm,Science,BBC,,https://www.sciencedaily.com/images/1920/two-colliding-asteroids.webp,,9aa0371e264688a29dc0eb3d7d9cc30c627c8de4

But for Sarah Sajedi, those soft, sandy beaches - or rather, what she found under them -inspired her pivot from a business career to an academic one. ""I was standing there looking out at this gorgeous view of the Andaman Sea, and then I looked down and beneath my feet were all these pieces of plastic, most of them water bottles,"" she says. ""I've always had a passion for waste reduction, but I realized that this was a problem with consumption."" Sajedi, BSc '91, decided to return to Concordia to pursue a PhD with a focus on plastic waste. As the co-founder of ERA Environmental Management Solutions, a leading provider of environmental, health and safety software, she brought decades of experience to complement her studies. Her latest paper, published in the Journal of Hazardous Materials , looks at the science around the health risks posed by single-use plastic water bottles. They are serious, she says, and seriously understudied. Tiny threats, little known In her review of over 140 scientific articles, Sajedi writes that individuals on average ingest between 39,000 and 52,000 microplastic particles per year, and bottled water users consume 90,000 more particles than tap water consumers. The particles are usually invisible to the naked eye. A microplastic particle can range between one micron -- a thousandth of a millimeter -- to five millimeters; nanoplastics are smaller than one micron. They emerge as bottles are made, stored, transported and broken down over their lifespans. Because they are often made from low-quality plastic, they shed tiny pieces every time they are manipulated and exposed to sunlight and temperature fluctuations. And unlike other types of plastic particles, which enter human bodies through the food chain, these are ingested directly from the source. As Sajedi notes, the health consequences can be severe. Once inside the body, these small plastics can cross biological boundaries, enter the bloodstream and reach vital organs. This can lead to chronic inflammation, oxidative stress on cells, hormonal disruption, impaired reproduction, neurological damage and various kinds of cancer. However, the long-term effects remain poorly understood due to a lack of widespread testing and standardized methods of measurement and detection. Sajedi identifies multiple methods researchers have used to measure nano- and microplastics, each with their own strengths and weaknesses. Some, for instance, can detect very small particles but cannot identify their chemical composition. Others can provide details about their makeup but miss the smallest plastics. And the best, most advanced and most reliable tools are often extremely costly and not always available. Education is the best prevention Sajedi is encouraged by the legislative action that has been adopted by governments around the world aimed at limiting plastic waste. However, she notes that the most common targets are single-use plastic bags, straws and packaging. Very few address the pressing issue of single-use water bottles. ""Education is the most important action we can take,"" she says. ""Drinking water from plastic bottles is fine in an emergency but it is not something that should be used in daily life. People need to understand that the issue is not acute toxicity -- it is chronic toxicity.""

This is especially true for Long COVID, a chronic condition that can develop after COVID-19 that causes a variety of lasting symptoms. Among the most common and debilitating of these is cognitive impairment, often referred to as ""brain fog,"" which affects over 80% of people with Long COVID. Given the hundreds of millions of global cases, Long COVID represents a massive public health and socioeconomic challenge, as it severely impacts people's ability to work and perform daily activities. Unfortunately, despite its prevalence, the underlying causes of Long COVID and brain fog remain poorly understood. Previous imaging studies have shown some structural changes in the brain, but they could not pinpoint the molecular dysfunctions responsible for the cognitive symptoms. Since it's difficult to observe the molecules that govern communication between brain cells directly, researchers are left without objective biomarkers to confirm a Long COVID diagnosis or develop therapies. To address this challenge, a research team led by Professor Takuya Takahashi from the Graduate School of Medicine at Yokohama City University, Japan, has made a significant breakthrough in understanding the cause of Long COVID brain fog. As explained in their paper, published in Brain Communications on October 1, 2025, the team hypothesized that patients with brain fog might exhibit disrupted expression of AMPA receptors (AMPARs) -- key molecules for memory and learning -- based on prior research into psychiatric and neurological disorders such as depression, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, and dementia. Thus, they used a novel method called [ 11 C]K-2 AMPAR PET imaging to directly visualize and quantify the density of AMPARs in the living human brain. By comparing imaging data from 30 patients with Long COVID to 80 healthy individuals, the researchers found a notable and widespread increase in the density of AMPARs across the brains of patients. This elevated receptor density was directly correlated with the severity of their cognitive impairment, suggesting a clear link between these molecular changes and the symptoms. Additionally, the concentrations of various inflammatory markers were also correlated with AMPAR levels, indicating a possible interaction between inflammation and receptor expression. Taken together, the study's findings represent a crucial step forward in addressing many unresolved issues regarding Long COVID. The systemic increase in AMPARs provides a direct biological explanation for the cognitive symptoms, highlighting a target for potential treatments. For example, drugs that suppress AMPAR activity could be a viable approach to mitigate brain fog. Interestingly, the team's analysis also demonstrated that imaging data can be used to distinguish patients from healthy controls with 100% sensitivity and 91% specificity. "" By applying our newly developed AMPA receptor PET imaging technology, we aim to provide a novel perspective and innovative solutions to the pressing medical challenge that is Long COVID, "" remarks Prof. Takahashi. While further efforts will be needed to find a definitive solution for Long COVID, this work is a promising step in the right direction. "" Our findings clearly demonstrate that Long COVID brain fog should be recognized as a legitimate clinical condition. This could encourage the healthcare industry to accelerate the development of diagnostic and therapeutic approaches for this disorder ,"" concludes Prof. Takahashi. In summary, the team's findings resolve key uncertainties about the biological basis of Long COVID brain fog and may pave the way for novel diagnostic tools and effective therapies for patients suffering from this condition.

8f4a4e576ead,Scientists find brain circuit that traps alcohol users in the vicious cycle of addiction,nervous system; pharmacology; diseases and conditions; down syndrome; neuroscience; behavior; anxiety; stress,"What compels someone to keep engaging in alcohol use, even if it damages their health, relationships and wellbeing? A new study from Scripps Research offers an important clue: a small midline brain region plays a key role in how animals learn to continue drinking to avoid the stress and misery of withdrawal. In a new study, published in Biological Psychiatry: Global Open Science on August 5, 2025, the Scripps Research team zeroed in on a set of brain cells in the paraventricular nucleus of the thalamus (PVT) in rats. They found that this region becomes more active, driving strong relapse behavior, when rats learn to associate environmental stimuli with the easing of withdrawal symptoms by alcohol. By illuminating this brain pathway, the research sheds light on one of the most stubborn features of addiction -- drinking not for pleasure, but to escape pain -- and could eventually lead to new treatments for substance use disorders (SUDs) as well as other maladaptive behaviors including anxiety. ""What makes addiction so hard to break is that people aren't simply chasing a high,"" says Friedbert Weiss, professor of neuroscience at Scripps Research and senior author of the study. ""They're also trying to get rid of powerful negative states, like the stress and anxiety of withdrawal. This work shows us which brain systems are responsible for locking in that kind of learning, and why it can make relapse so persistent."" ""This brain region just lit up in every rat that had gone through withdrawal-related learning,"" says co-senior author Hermina Nedelescu of Scripps Research. ""It shows us which circuits are recruited when the brain links alcohol with relief from stress -- and that could be a game-changer in how we think about relapse."" From behavior to brain maps An estimated 14.5 million people in the United States have alcohol use disorder, which encompasses a range of unhealthy drinking behaviors. Like other drug addictions, alcohol addiction is characterized by cycles of withdrawal, abstinence and relapse. In 2022, Weiss and Nedelescu used rats to study the types of learning that happen in the brain throughout this cycle. When rats initially begin drinking, they learn to associate pleasure with alcohol and seek more. However, that conditioning becomes far stronger during multiple cycles of withdrawal and relapse. After learning that alcohol eased the unpleasant feelings of withdrawal -- what scientists call negative reinforcement or a relief of 'negative hedonic state' -- the animals sought out more alcohol and would remain persistent even when uncomfortable. ""When rats learn to associate environmental stimuli or contexts with the experience of relief, they end up with an incredibly powerful urge to seek alcohol in the presence of that stimuli -even if conditions are introduced that require great effort to engage in alcohol seeking,"" says Weiss. ""That is, these rats seek alcohol even if that behavior is punished."" In the new work, the team wanted to pin down exactly what networks of cells in the brain were responsible for learning to associate environmental cues with the relief of this negative hedonic state. The researchers used advanced imaging tools to scan entire rat brains, cell by cell, and pinpoint areas that became more active in response to alcohol-related cues. They compared four groups of rats: those that had gone through withdrawal and learned that alcohol relieves a negative hedonic state, and three different control groups that had not. While several brain areas showed increased activity in the withdrawal-learned rats, one stood out: the PVT, which is known for its role in stress and anxiety. ""In retrospect, this makes a lot of sense,"" says Nedelescu. ""The unpleasant effects of alcohol withdrawal are strongly associated with stress, and alcohol is providing relief from the agony of that stressful state."" The researchers hypothesize that this negative hedonic state, and the activation of the PVT in the brain as a response, is critical for how the brain learns and perpetuates addiction. A better understanding of addiction The implications of the new study extend well beyond alcohol, the researchers say. Environmental stimuli conditioned to negative reinforcement -- the drive to act in order to escape pain or stress -- is a universal feature of the brain, and can drive human behavior beyond substance use disorders such as anxiety disorders, fear-conditioning and traumatic avoidance learning. ""This work has potential applications not only for alcohol addiction, but also other disorders where people get trapped in harmful cycles,"" says Nedelescu. Future research will zoom in even further. Nedelescu and colleagues at Scripps Research want to expand the study to females and to study neurochemicals released in the PVT when subjects encounter environments associated with the experience of this relief from a negative hedonic state. If they can pinpoint molecules that are involved, it could open new avenues for drug development by targeting those molecules. For now, the new study underscores a key shift in how basic scientists think about addiction. ""As psychologists, we've long known that addiction isn't just about chasing pleasure -- it's about escaping those negative hedonic states,"" says Weiss. ""This study shows us where in the brain that learning takes root, which is a step forward."" In addition to Weiss and Nedelescu, authors of the study, ""Recruitment of Neuronal Populations in the Paraventricular Thalamus of Alcohol Seeking Rats with Withdrawal-related Learning Experience,"" are Elias Meamari, Nami Rajaei, Alexus Grey, Ryan Bullard, and Nobuyoshi Suto of Scripps; and Nathan O'Connor of MBF Bioscience.

ca0244d66f4b,Nanotech transforms vinegar into a lifesaving superbug killer,diabetes; pharmacology; pharmaceuticals; diseases and conditions; cancer; lung cancer; foodborne illness; wounds and healing,"Wounds that do not heal are often caused by bacterial infections and are particularly dangerous for the elderly and people with diabetes, cancer and other conditions. Acetic acid (more commonly known as vinegar) has been used for centuries as a disinfectant, but it is only effective against a small number of bacteria, and it does not kill the most dangerous types. New research led by researchers at University of Bergen in Norway, QIMR Berghofer and Flinders University in Australia has resulted in the ability to boost the natural bacterial killing qualities of vinegar by adding antimicrobial nanoparticles made from carbon and cobalt. The findings have been published in the international journal ACS Nano . Molecular biologists Dr Adam Truskewycz and Professor Nils Halberg found these particles could kill several dangerous bacterial species, and their activity was enhanced when added to a weak vinegar solution. As part of the study, Dr Truskewycz and Professor Halberg added cobalt-containing carbon quantum dot nanoparticles to weak acetic acid (vinegar) to create a potent antimicrobial treatment. They used this mixture against several pathogenic species, including the drug resistant Staphylococcus aureus , Escherichia coli ( E. coli ) and Enterococcus faecalis . Dr Truskewycz said the acidic environment from the vinegar made bacterial cells swell and take up the nanoparticle treatment. ""Once exposed, the nanoparticles appear to attack dangerous bacteria from both inside the bacterial cell and also on its surface, causing them to burst. Importantly, this approach is non-toxic to human cells and was shown to remove bacterial infections from mice wounds without affecting healing,"" he said. The anti-bacterial boost in vinegar found in the study could potentially be an important contribution towards the ongoing battle against the rising antimicrobial resistance levels worldwide, with an estimated 4.5 million deaths associated with a direct infectious disease. Professor Halberg said this study showed how nanoparticles could be used to increase the effectiveness of traditional bacterial treatments. ""Combination treatments such as the ones highlighted in this study may help to curb antimicrobial resistance. Given this issue can kill up to 5 million people each year, it's vital we look to find new ways of killing pathogens like viruses, bacteria and fungi or parasites,"" he said.",https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/10/251006051122.htm,Science,BBC,,https://www.sciencedaily.com/images/1920/bacteria-superbug-pseudomonas-aeruginosa-rod-shaped-pathogen.webp,,9e6a4bfa31a21bc8002e111df5cd713182286e56
761134a00057,Birds around the world share a mysterious warning cry,ecology research; evolutionary biology; nature; behavioral science; birds; animals; developmental biology; agriculture and food,"Birds separated by vast geographic distances and millions of years of evolution share a remarkably similar learned vocal warning to identify parasitic enemies near their nests, an international team of researchers has found. The results represent the first known example of an animal vocalization that is learned from an innate response shared across multiple species. The findings, published on October 3 in Nature Ecology and Evolution, provide a glimpse into the role natural selection can play in the evolution of vocal communication systems. The study, led by researchers at Cornell University and Donana Biological Station in Seville, Spain, is one of the largest and most comprehensive studies concerning brood parasites to date. Brood parasitism occurs when birds, such as cuckoos, lay their eggs in other species' nests, forcing the host to raise their young, often at the expense of the host's own offspring. That's why it is advantageous for the host species to identify and try to prevent nest parasites from laying eggs. The researchers found that more than 20 different bird species across four continents produce nearly identical ""whining"" vocalizations when they spot a parasitic bird in their territory. The researchers wondered why birds from locations spanning Australia, China and Zambia all use the same call to identify their parasites, despite never coming into contact with each other. When a bird hears the warning call, it instinctively comes to investigate. That's when, according to the researchers, the birds start absorbing the cues around them -- what Damián Blasi, co-author of the study and a language scientist at Pompeu Fabra University, Spain, calls social transmission. ""It's then, when birds are absorbing the clues around them, that the bird learns when to produce the sound in the future,"" said James Kennerley, co-lead author and postdoctoral fellow at the Cornell Lab of Ornithology. ""The fascinating thing about this call is that it represents a midpoint between the instinctive vocalizations we often see in animals and fully learned vocal units like human words,"" said William Feeney, an evolutionary ecologist at Donana Biological Station in Seville, Spain, and co-lead of the study. The research also revealed species that produce the whining call tend to live in areas with complex networks of interactions between brood parasites and their hosts. ""With birds working together to drive parasites away, communicating how and when to cooperate is really important, so this call is popping up in parts of the world where species are most affected by brood parasitism,"" said Kennerley. The result, he said, ""is that the evolution of the whining vocalization is affecting patterns of cooperative behaviors between birds around the world."" The link between the innate whining sound and the learned response by the bird is what makes this study unique, the authors said. ""For the first time, we've documented a vocalization that has both learned and innate components, potentially showing how learned signals may have evolved from innate calls in a way first suggested by Charles Darwin,"" Feeney said. ""It's like seeing how evolution can enable species to give learned meanings to sounds."" The findings challenge long-held assumptions about the sharp division between animal communication systems and human language. The authors suggest that learned communication systems, like human language, may have evolved through the gradual integration of instinctive and learned elements.",https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/10/251006051113.htm,Science,BBC,,https://www.sciencedaily.com/images/1920/bar-winged-prinia-birds-singing.webp,,61844125e98f5c6bf42fc8376ba6362981bbec20
c0341666a7d1,Astronomers discover the most powerful and distant cosmic ring ever seen,space exploration; space telescopes; galaxies; dark matter; black holes; nasa; astrophysics; cosmology,"The most distant and most powerful 'odd radio circle' (ORC) known so far has been discovered by astronomers. These curious rings are a relatively new astronomical phenomenon, having been detected for the first time just six years ago. Only a handful of confirmed examples are known - most of which are 10-20 times the size of our Milky Way galaxy. ORCs are enormous, faint, ring-shaped structures of radio emission surrounding galaxies which are visible only in the radio band of the electromagnetic spectrum and consist of relativistic, magnetized plasma. Previous research has suggested they might be caused by shockwaves from merging supermassive black holes or galaxies. Now, a new study published on October 2 in Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society proposes that the rings of light may actually be linked to superwind outflows from spiral host radio galaxies. Researchers led by the University of Mumbai made their discovery with the help of the RAD@home Astronomy Collaboratory citizen science platform and the Low-Frequency Array (LOFAR), the world's largest and most sensitive radio telescope operating at low frequencies (10 to 240 megahertz). The source, designated RAD J131346.9+500320, lies nearly at redshift ~0.94 (when the universe was half its current age), making it both the most distant and the most powerful ORC known to date. It also has not one but two intersecting rings - only the second such example with this feature - sparking more questions than answers. Dr Ananda Hota, founder of the RAD@home Astronomy Collaboratory for citizen science research, said: ""This work shows how professional astronomers and citizen scientists together can push the boundaries of scientific discovery. ""ORCs are among the most bizarre and beautiful cosmic structures we've ever seen - and they may hold vital clues about how galaxies and black holes co-evolve, hand-in-hand."" RAD J131346.9+500320 is the first ORC discovered through citizen science and the first identified with the help of LOFAR. LOFAR is a cutting-edge pan-European radio telescope, with hundreds of thousands of simple antennas spread across the Netherlands and partner stations in many European countries. Working together as one giant interferometer, it provides an exceptionally sharp and sensitive view of the sky at low radio frequencies. It enables astronomers to look back billions of years to a time before the first stars and galaxies formed by surveying vast areas of the low-frequency radio sky. Alongside the new ORC discovery, the RAD@home Astronomy Collaboratory also found two other unusual cosmic giants. The first, RAD J122622.6+640622, is a galaxy nearly three million light-years across - more than 25 times the size of our Milky Way. One of its powerful jets suddenly bends sideways, as if forced off course, and then blows a spectacular radio ring about 100,000 light-years wide. The second, RAD J142004.0+621715, stretches across 1.4 million light-years and shows a similar ring of radio emission at the end of one of its jets, with another narrow radio jet on the other side of the host galaxy. Both galaxies sit in crowded regions of space called galaxy clusters, where their jets likely interact with surrounding matter, million degree hot thermal plasma, which shapes these striking cosmic structures. All three objects are found in galaxy clusters weighing about 100 trillion Suns, suggesting that interactions of relativistic magnetised plasma jets with the surrounding hot thermal plasma may help shape these rare rings. Co-author Dr Pratik Dabhade, of the National Centre for Nuclear Research in Warsaw, Poland, said: ""These discoveries show that ORCs and radio rings are not isolated curiosities - they are part of a broader family of exotic plasma structures shaped by black hole jets, winds, and their environments. ""The fact that citizen scientists uncovered them highlights the continued importance of human pattern recognition, even in the age of machine learning."" With upcoming facilities such as the Square Kilometre Array (SKA), astronomers expect many more ORCs to be uncovered. At the same time, new optical surveys such as the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) and the Vera C. Rubin Observatory's Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) will provide the redshifts and environments of their host galaxies, helping to piece together how these mysterious rings form and evolve. For now, the three new cosmic rings - discovered not by automated software but by sharp-eyed citizen scientists - represent an important step toward unlocking the secrets of these vast, puzzling structures.",https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/10/251006051111.htm,Science,BBC,,https://www.sciencedaily.com/images/1920/orc-rad-j1313469500320.webp,,d4064264e9708844397de7db85a71832f8226859
59b34c806db5,"3,000 years of secrets hidden beneath Egypt’s greatest temple",ancient civilizations; evolution; anthropology; early climate; cultures; lost treasures; origin of life; archaeology,"Most complete study of the temple complex and its landscape establishes earliest occupation and hints at link to creation myth. Researchers have carried out the most comprehensive geoarcheological survey of Egypt's Karnak Temple near Luxor - one of the ancient world's largest temple complexes and a UNESCO World Heritage site welcoming millions of tourists every year. The study, published in Antiquity today (October 6) reveals new evidence on the age of the temple, tantalising links to ancient Egyptian mythology, and new insights about the interplay between the temple's riverine landscape and the people who occupied and developed the site over its 3,000 years of use. ""This new research provides unprecedented detail on the evolution of Karnak Temple, from a small island to one of the defining institutions of Ancient Egypt,"" says Dr Ben Pennington, lead author of the paper and a Visiting Fellow in Geoarchaeology at the University of Southampton. Karnak temple is located 500 meters east of the present-day River Nile near Luxor, at the Ancient Egyptian religious capital of Thebes. An international research team, led by Dr Angus Graham (Uppsala University) and involving several academics from the University of Southampton, analyzed 61 sediment cores from within and around the temple site. The team also studied tens of thousands of ceramic fragments to help date their findings. Using this evidence, researchers have been able to map out how the landscape around the site changed throughout its history. They found that prior to about 2520 BCE, the site would have been unsuitable for permanent occupation due to being regularly flooded by fast-flowing water from the Nile. This means the earliest occupation at Karnak would have likely been during the Old Kingdom ( c. 2591-2152 BC). Ceramic fragments found at the site corroborate this finding, with the earliest dating from sometime between c. 2305 to 1980 BC. Dr Kristian Strutt, a co-author of the paper from the University of Southampton, said: ""The age of Karnak Temple has been hotly contested in archaeological circles, but our new evidence places a temporal constraint on its earliest occupation and construction."" The land on which Karnak was founded was formed when river channels cut into their beds to the west and east, creating an island of high ground in what is now the east/south-east of the temple precinct. This emerging island provided the foundation for occupation and early construction of Karnak temple. Over subsequent centuries and millennia, the river channels either side of the site diverged further, creating more space for the temple complex to develop. Researchers were surprised to find that the eastern channel - until this study not much more than a supposition - was more well-defined, and perhaps even larger than the channel to the west, which archeologists had previously focused on. Dominic Barker, another co-author also from the University of Southampton added: ""The river channels surrounding the site shaped how the temple could develop and where, with new construction taking place on top of old rivers as they silted up."" ""We also see how Ancient Egyptians shaped the river itself, through the dumping of sands from the desert into channels, possibly to provide new land for building, for example."" This new understanding of the temple's landscape has striking similarities to an Ancient Egyptian creation myth, leading the team to believe that the decision to locate the temple here could have been linked to the religious views of its inhabitants. Ancient Egyptian texts of the Old Kingdom say that the creator god manifested as high ground, emerging from 'the lake'. The island upon which Karnak was found is the only known such area of high ground surrounded by water in the area. ""It's tempting to suggest the Theban elites chose Karnak's location for the dwelling place of a new form of the creator god, 'Ra-Amun', as it fitted the cosmogonical scene of high ground emerging from surrounding water,"" says Dr Pennington. ""Later texts of the Middle Kingdom ( c. 1980-1760 BC) develop this idea, with the 'primeval mound' rising from the 'Waters of Chaos'. During this period, the abating of the annual flood would have echoed this scene, with the mound on which Karnak was built appearing to 'rise' and grow from the receding floodwaters."" With a concession to study the whole floodplain of the Luxor region, the team are now planning and carrying out work at other major sites in the area, to further understand the landscapes and waterscapes of the whole Ancient Egyptian religious capital zone. The Conceptual origins and geomorphic evolution of the temple of Amun-Ra at Karnak (Luxor, Egypt) is published in Antiquity and is available online.

Skywatching Highlights Oct. 6: The October supermoon Oct. 6-10: The Draconid meteor shower Oct. 21: The Orionid meteor shower peaks (full duration Sept. 26 -- Nov. 22) <See video link at the bottom.> Transcript What's Up for October? A Supermoon takes over, the Draconid meteor shower peeks through, and the Orionid meteors sparkle across the night sky. The evening of October 6, look up and be amazed as the full moon is bigger and brighter because -- it's a supermoon! This evening, the moon could appear to be about 30% brighter and up to 14% larger than a typical full moon. But why? Supermoons happen when a new moon or a full moon coincides with ""perigee,"" which is when the moon is at its closest to Earth all month. So this is an exceptionally close full moon! Which explains its spectacular appearance. And what timing -- while the supermoon appears on October 6th, just a couple of days before on October 4th is ""International Observe the Moon Night""! It's an annual, worldwide event when Moon enthusiasts come together to enjoy our natural satellite.You can attend or host a moon-viewing party, or simply observe the Moon from wherever you are. So look up, and celebrate the moon along with people all around the world! The supermoon will light up the sky on October 6th, but if you luck into some dark sky between October 6th and 10th, you might witness the first of two October meteor showers -- the Draconids! The Draconid meteor shower comes from debris trailing the comet 21P Giacobini-Zinner burning up in Earth's atmosphere These meteors originate from nearby the head of the constellation Draco the dragon in the northern sky and the shower can produce up to 10 meteors per hour! The Draconids peak around October 8th, but if you don't see any, you can always blame the bright supermoon and wait a few weeks until the next meteor shower -- the Orionids! The Orionid meteor shower, peaking October 21, is set to put on a spectacular show, shooting about 20 meteors per hour across the night sky. This meteor shower happens when Earth travels through the debris trailing behind Halley's Comet and it burns up in our atmosphere. The full duration of the meteor shower stretches from September 26 to November 22, but your best bet to see meteors is on October 21 before midnight until around 2 am. This is because, not only is this night the shower's peak, it is also the October new moon, meaning the moon will be between the Earth and the Sun, making it dark and invisible to us. With a moonless sky, you're much more likely to catch a fireball careening through the night. So find a dark location after the sun has set, look to the southeast sky (if you're in the northern hemisphere) and the northeast (if you're in the southern hemisphere) and enjoy! Orionid meteors appear to come from the direction of the Orion constellation but you might catch them all across the sky. Here are the phases of the Moon for October.",https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/10/251005085754.htm,Science,BBC,,https://www.sciencedaily.com/images/1920/stars-moon-meteor-shower.webp,,95da27f473f93318445abf6c1da84db695c294a5
fa6ae2167f33,Thousands of sparkling newborn stars ignite in Webb’s Lobster Nebula view,space exploration; galaxies; nasa; space telescopes; neptune; stars; black holes; astrophysics,"This is a sparkling scene of star birth captured by NASA's James Webb Space Telescope. What appears to be a craggy, starlit mountaintop kissed by wispy clouds is actually a cosmic dust-scape being eaten away by the blistering winds and radiation of nearby, massive, infant stars. Called Pismis 24, this young star cluster resides in the core of the nearby Lobster Nebula, approximately 5,500 light-years from Earth in the constellation Scorpius. Home to a vibrant stellar nursery and one of the closest sites of massive star birth, Pismis 24 provides rare insight into large and massive stars. Its proximity makes this region one of the best places to explore the properties of hot young stars and how they evolve. At the heart of this glittering cluster is the brilliant Pismis 24-1. It is at the center of a clump of stars above the jagged orange peaks, and the tallest spire is pointing directly toward it. Pismis 24-1 appears as a gigantic single star, and it was once thought to be the most massive known star. Scientists have since learned that it is composed of at least two stars, though they cannot be resolved in this image. At 74 and 66 solar masses, respectively, the two known stars are still among the most massive and luminous stars ever seen. Captured in infrared light by Webb's NIRCam (Near-Infrared Camera), this image reveals thousands of jewel-like stars of varying sizes and colors. The largest and most brilliant ones with the six-point diffraction spikes are the most massive stars in the cluster. Hundreds to thousands of smaller members of the cluster appear as white, yellow, and red, depending on their stellar type and the amount of dust enshrouding them. Webb also shows us tens of thousands of stars behind the cluster that are part of the Milky Way galaxy. Super-hot, infant stars -some almost 8 times the temperature of the Sun - blast out scorching radiation and punishing winds that are sculpting a cavity into the wall of the star-forming nebula. That nebula extends far beyond NIRCam's field of view. Only small portions of it are visible at the bottom and top right of the image. Streamers of hot, ionized gas flow off the ridges of the nebula, and wispy veils of gas and dust, illuminated by starlight, float around its towering peaks. Dramatic spires jut from the glowing wall of gas, resisting the relentless radiation and winds. They are like fingers pointing toward the hot, young stars that have sculpted them. The fierce forces shaping and compressing these spires cause new stars to form within them. The tallest spire spans about 5.4 light-years from its tip to the bottom of the image. More than 200 of our solar systems out to Neptune's orbit could fit into the width its tip, which is 0.14 lightyears. In this image, the color cyan indicates hot or ionized hydrogen gas being heated up by the massive young stars. Dust molecules similar to smoke here on Earth are represented in orange. Red signifies cooler, denser molecular hydrogen. The darker the red, the denser the gas. Black denotes the densest gas, which is not emitting light. The wispy white features are dust and gas that are scattering starlight. The James Webb Space Telescope is the world's premier space science observatory. Webb is solving mysteries in our solar system, looking beyond to distant worlds around other stars, and probing the mysterious structures and origins of our universe and our place in it. Webb is an international program led by NASA with its partners, ESA (European Space Agency) and CSA (Canadian Space Agency).",https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/10/251005085645.htm,Science,BBC,,https://www.sciencedaily.com/images/1920/pismis-24.webp,,952f61b75b106d89fc74e88f92a5cee2cb097b8f
e9425a0a4c45,Black holes might hold the key to a 60-year cosmic mystery,black holes; galaxies; cosmic rays; stars; quantum physics; physics; optics; materials science,"The universe is full of different types of radiation and particles that can be observed here on Earth. This includes photons across the entire range of the electromagnetic spectrum, from the lowest radio frequencies all the way to the highest-energy gamma rays. It also includes other particles such as neutrinos and cosmic rays, which race through the universe at close to the speed of light. Curiously, ""cosmic rays"" are not actually rays - this name has historical reasons - but small particles, mostly atomic nuclei, which are accelerated to enormous energies somewhere in the universe. Although their sources are not yet fully understood, they are most likely associated with some of the most extreme environments in the universe, such as black holes, supernovae, or rotating neutron stars (a type of dead star). But occasionally cosmic rays have much higher energy than usual. We've known about this since 1962, but we still have no idea why. We also don't know where this ultra-high-energy cosmic radiation comes from. Now, research from the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU) may have found the answer to this big unanswered question in physics. Supermassive black holes may be the cause Foteini Oikonomou, an associate professor at NTNU's Department of Physics, is working on the case. In a recent article, she and her colleagues present a completely new and plausible explanation for this ultra-high-energy radiation. The lead author is PhD research fellow Domenik Ehlert from the same department. The team also includes postdoctoral fellow Enrico Peretti from the Université Paris Cité. Their work focuses on astroparticle physics, which studies the relationship between the smallest particles in the universe and the universe's largest phenomena. ""We suspect that this high-energy radiation is created by winds from supermassive black holes,"" said Oikonomou. But what on earth does that mean? Active black holes create winds The Milky Way is the neighborhood in the universe where you and I live. Our Sun and solar system are part of this galaxy, along with at least 100 billion other stars. ""There is a black hole called Sagittarius-A* located right in the centre of the Milky Way. This black hole is currently in a quiet phase where it isn't consuming any stars, as there is not enough matter in the vicinity,"" Peretti said. This contrasts with growing, supermassive, active black holes that consume up to several times the mass of our own Sun each year. ""A tiny portion of the material can be pushed away by the force of the black hole before it is pulled in. As a result, around half of these supermassive black holes create winds that move through the universe at up to half the speed of light,"" Peretti said. We have known about these gigantic winds for approximately ten years. The winds from these black holes can affect galaxies. By blowing away gases, they can prevent new stars from forming, for example. This is dramatic enough in itself, but Oikonomou and her colleagues looked at something else, much smaller, that these winds could be the cause of."" It is possible that these powerful winds accelerate the particles that create the ultra-high-energy radiation,"" said Ehlert. To understand this, we also need to explain a little bit about atoms. Atoms and enormous amounts of energy Atoms consist of a nucleus, which is made up of protons and neutrons. These particles are made up of quarks, but we don't need to go into that right now. One or more electrons can be found around this nucleus in the so-called cloud. ""The ultra-high-energy radiation consists of protons or atomic nuclei with energy up to 1020 electron volts,"" explained Oikonomou. If that number doesn't mean anything to you, you should know that in this context, it is an absolutely enormous amount of energy. ""A particle like this, which is smaller than an atom, contains about as much energy as a tennis ball when Serena Williams serves it at 200 kilometers per hour,"" said Oikonomou. It corresponds to approximately a billion times more energy than the particles created by researchers in the Large Hadron Collider in Switzerland and France. Fortunately, these cosmic rays are destroyed by the Earth's atmosphere. When they reach ground level, they are as harmless as all the other cosmic radiation that reaches us at the Earth's surface. ""But for astronauts, cosmic radiation is a very serious problem,"" Oikonomou said. Airline crews don't need to worry about this because they don't fly high enough. ""The main concern for astronauts is cosmic low-energy radiation produced by our own Sun, because it is much more common. The rays we study are infrequent enough that it is extremely unlikely they would pass through an astronaut,"" she said. Other suspects Previously, researchers have looked into whether these high-energy particles come from gamma-ray bursts, from galaxies that are creating new stars at an extremely high rate, or from plasma outflows from supermassive black holes. However, Oikonomou and her colleagues have another hypothesis. ""All the other hypotheses are very good guesses - they are all sources that contain a lot of energy. But no one has provided evidence that any of them are the source. That is why we decided to investigate the winds from the supermassive black holes,"" said Ehlert. Guilty? Maybe So what do we actually know? Is it the winds that create the high-energy particles in the cosmic radiation? ""Our answer is more of a cautious 'maybe',"" said Oikonomou. That doesn't sound particularly dramatic. However, when researchers ask questions like this, they often feel a sense of excitement and think ""YES, that might just be the case!,"" but that doesn't mean it is the case in this instance. ""We find that the conditions related to these winds align particularly well with particle acceleration. But we are still unable to prove that it is specifically these winds that accelerate the particles behind the high-energy cosmic radiation,"" Oikonomou said. However, the model the researchers are using can explain one specific aspect of these particles that we still don't understand. Within a certain energy range, the particles have a chemical composition that other models cannot explain in any meaningful way. ""We can also test the model using neutrino experiments,"" said Oikonomou. That, however, is something for a completely different article. ""In the years to come, we hope to collaborate with neutrino astronomers to test our hypothesis,"" Oikonomou said. Perhaps they will then find more evidence, one way or the other.",https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/10/251005085639.htm,Science,BBC,,https://www.sciencedaily.com/images/1920/how-black-hole-winds-blow.webp,,e79603b2ea5a83dbac68e0b3f7c480aef81bae50
52b0df0ac96c,"For 170 years, U.S. Cities have followed a hidden law of growth and decline",stem education; education and employment; land management; public health; racial disparity; educational policy; religion; ocean policy,"A new study out of the Complexity Science Hub (CSH) reveals that, over 170 years of economic history, the transformation of U.S. cities follows a surprisingly stable rule: while cities evolve and diversify, they on average maintain a constant level of ""coherence"" -- a measure of how well their economic activities fit together. The research by Simone Daniotti, Matte Hartog, and Frank Neffke analyzed a unique dataset of 650 million U.S. census records, 6 million patents, and other historical sources covering nearly two centuries of urban development. ""We observed that, on average, the cities that make up the U.S urban system transform gradually but surely over time-from craftsmanship and manufacturing to services and engineering. Despite this, they maintain a constant level of coherence for nearly two centuries,"" explains CSH fellow Daniotti, first author of the study. West Coast: rapid diversification, constant coherence ""This also happened and in the same way on the West Coast, which developed later and initially in isolation from the wider U.S.. In 1850, cities such as Los Angeles and San Francisco are just emerging there with the onset of the Gold Rush,"" adds Daniotti, who is also a researcher at Utrecht University. The study reveals that the West Coast experienced a rapid and far-reaching structural shift. ""The transformation was massive-faster and more pronounced than on the East Coast,"" says Daniotti. In 1850, less than half of all the export-oriented occupations that existed in the wider US were also practiced on the West Coast -- but within just fifty years, that share had surged to nearly 90%. ""But, despite rapid diversification, West Coast cities' average coherence remained remarkable constant and at levels that were comparable to those of eastern US cities."" Why transformations are constrained ""The findings show that, although cities develop new activities and abandon old ones, they do so in a way that keeps their coherence constant. This suggests that such transformations are constrained: although cities can develop new activities and drop old ones, while doing so, the set of industries they maintain seems to need to stay coherent at any given point in time,"" explains Neffke, who leads CSH's Transforming Economies research group. ""So even in cases like Pittsburgh or Boston, which went through periods of prolonged decline and only emerged from those after abandoning their heavy manufacturing industries in steel and manufacturing for high-tech production and services, they needed to find a path that would allow them to do so without jeopardizing their coherence,"" adds Neffke. Size matters: coherence shrinks as cities grow In addition, the study shows that larger cities are consistently less coherent, with coherence declining at a stable rate of about 4% for each doubling of population size. Even though technologies have changed dramatically -- from railroads and telephones to mass production, computers, and AI -- and the U.S. population has grown from about 23 million in 1850 to 332 million in 2022 while moving steadily westward, the way coherence scales with population size has stayed the same. ""This suggests that the way economic activity is distributed within an urban system follows some universal regularities that constrain the amount of diversity that cities can maintain -- keeping them coherent -- based on the size of their population,"" says Neffke. Policy lessons: balancing diversification and coherence A number of lessons can be learned from these findings by policymakers, according to the researchers. While the drive to branch out into emerging technologies is understandable, cities cannot spread themselves too thin -- they must maintain a degree of coherence. ""The reason is that the capability base that supports their existing economic structure and is embedded in local infrastructure, workforce, and institutions is expensive to maintain and therefore is ideally kept compact,"" explains Neffke. ""However, larger cities can sustain a broader set of capabilities, which gives them more room for diversification. But the amount of diversity a city can realistically support is tied to its size. This highlights the importance of benchmarking cities against peers of similar sizes and to recognize that ambitions for diversification are ultimately constrained by size."" What Coherence Means for Cities In the study, coherence is the glue that holds a city's economy together. It reflects how similar or connected two randomly chosen workers -- or firms, or patents -- in the same city are in terms of their occupations, industries, or technologies. To explain this in simple terms, coherence combines three related ideas, according to Daniotti. First, the variety of activities a city hosts; second, the balance of how evenly these activities are spread across the workforce; and third, the disparity in how different those activities are from each other. A highly coherent city tends to have fewer industries that are closely related, like Detroit during its golden age of car-making, while a less coherent city, such as New York City, may span many unrelated sectors.",https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/10/251005085635.htm,Science,BBC,,https://www.sciencedaily.com/images/1920/downtown-manhattan-new-york-city-at-dusk.webp,,0c7a4728ff1c914b0034082e4447ffeff8390718
ec1e96c98b61,It’s not just genes — parents can pass down longevity another way,diet and weight loss; fertility; healthy aging; genes; molecular biology; biotechnology and bioengineering; cell biology; epigenetics research,"New research in the roundworm C. elegans shows how changes in the parent's lysosomes that promote longevity are transferred to its offspring. The work describes a new link between lysosomes -- cellular organelles once thought to be the cell's recycling center -- and the epigenome -- a set of chemical marks that modify gene expression. The study also details a new way that epigenetic information is transmitted from cells in the body to reproductive cells, allowing changes to be inherited without affecting the genetic code. These insights show how epigenetic modifications that help organisms cope with environmental stress can be conferred from parents to their offspring. In the Wang Lab, it's not unusual for worms to live for a long time. HHMI Janelia Research Campus Senior Group Leader Meng Wang and her team study longevity. They've shown that by overexpressing an enzyme in the lysosomes of the roundworm C. elegans , they can extend the worm's life by up to 60 percent. But surprisingly, the team found the worms' progeny without this genetic modification were still living longer than normal. When they crossed their long-lived worms with ""wild-type"" worms that weren't overexpressing the enzyme -- a routine lab procedure used to wipe clean any genetic manipulations -- they saw that the offspring also lived longer than normal worms. Somehow, the longevity markers were being transferred from generation to generation, even four generations later. In new research, Wang and her team uncover how changes in the worm's lysosomes that promote longevity are transferred from cells in its body to its reproductive cells through histones -- proteins that play a key role in organizing and regulating DNA. In reproductive cells, these histone messengers cause modifications in the worm's epigenome -- a collection of chemical tags that regulate gene expression -- enabling the lysosomal changes to be passed from generation to generation without changing the underlying DNA. The findings have repercussions well beyond longevity. Epigenetic modifications can help organisms cope with many different types of environmental stressors -- from diet changes to pollutant exposure to psychological stress -- and the new work shows how these advantages could be conferred from parents to their offspring. ""You always think that your inheritance is in the nucleus, within the cell, but now we show that the histone can go from one place to another place, and if that histone carries any modification, that means you are going to transfer the epigenetic information from one cell to another,"" Wang says. ""It really provides a mechanism for understanding the transgenerational effect."" Uncovering inheritance The researchers found that one type of histone modification -- a type of epigenetic change -- was elevated in long-lived worms compared to those with normal lifespans. They wanted to see how this modification related to lysosomal changes that promote longevity. Using a combination of genetic tools, transcriptomics, and imaging, they found that changes in lysosomal metabolism affecting the worms' longevity activate a series of processes inside the cell. These actions trigger an increase in a specific histone variant, which is transported from the worm's somatic or body tissues to its germline or reproductive cells through proteins that deliver nutrients to developing eggs. In the germline, the histone is modified, allowing the information from the lysosome to enter the germline and be passed from parent to child. The researchers show that this pathway is activated during fasting, which causes a change in lysosomal metabolism -- providing a link from the physiological phenomenon to the changes in the germline. The new work adds to a growing body of evidence that lysosomes, once thought to only act as the cell's recycling centers, also function as a signaling hub to control different processes in the cell and now are shown to affect generations. The new research also unveils a new mechanism for transporting information from somatic to germline cells through histones, which could help explain how other types of inherited information are passed from parent to offspring. By providing a mechanism for understanding how environmental changes to somatic cells are passed through the germline, the new work could help researchers better understand transgenerational effects that have been previously observed, like the malnutrition of a parent affecting its offspring. ""We now show that the soma and the germline can be connected by the histone and can carry memorable genetic information for generations,"" Wang says.",https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/10/251005085628.htm,Science,BBC,,https://www.sciencedaily.com/images/1920/four-generations-of-women.webp,,0db7a007623d500573cf0b8fd40b5d635641e055
517558b6d528,Why ultra-processed foods aren’t the real villain behind overeating,diet and weight loss; obesity; nutrition; personalized medicine; dieting and weight control; nutrition research; perception; consumer behavior,"Ultra-processed foods (UPFs) have become public enemy number one in nutrition debates. From dementia to obesity and an epidemic of ""food addiction,"" these factory-made products, including crisps, ready meals, fizzy drinks and packaged snacks, are blamed for a wide range of modern health problems. Some experts argue that they're ""specifically formulated and aggressively marketed to maximise consumption and corporate profits,"" hijacking our brain's reward systems to make us eat beyond our needs. Policymakers have proposed bold interventions: warning labels, marketing restrictions, taxes, even outright bans near schools. But how much of this urgency is based on solid evidence? My colleagues and I wanted to step back and ask: what actually makes people like a food? And what drives them to overeat - not just enjoy it, but keep eating after hunger has passed? We studied more than 3,000 UK adults and their responses to over 400 everyday foods. What we found challenges the simplistic UPF narrative and offers a more nuanced way forward. Two ideas often get blurred in nutrition discourse: liking a food and hedonic overeating (eating for pleasure rather than hunger). Liking is about taste. Hedonic overeating is about continuing to eat because the food feels good. They're related, but not identical. Many people like porridge but rarely binge on it. Chocolate, biscuits and ice cream, on the other hand, top both lists. We conducted three large online studies where participants rated photos of unbranded food portions for how much they liked them and how likely they were to overeat them. The foods were recognizable items from a typical UK shopping basket: jacket potatoes, apples, noodles, cottage pie, custard creams - more than 400 in total. We then compared these responses with three things: the foods' nutritional content (fat, sugar, fiber, energy density), their classification as ultra-processed by the widely used Nova system - a food classification method that groups foods by the extent and purpose of their processing - and how people perceived them (sweet, fatty, processed, healthy and so on). Perception power Some findings were expected: people liked foods they ate often, and calorie-dense foods were more likely to lead to overeating. But the more surprising insight came from the role of beliefs and perceptions. Nutrient content mattered - people rated high-fat, high-carb foods as more enjoyable, and low-fiber, high-calorie foods as more ""bingeable."" But what people believed about the food also mattered, a lot. Perceiving a food as sweet, fatty or highly processed increased the likelihood of overeating, regardless of its actual nutritional content. Foods believed to be bitter or high in fiber had the opposite effect. In one survey, we could predict 78% of the variation in people's likelihood of overeating by combining nutrient data (41%) with beliefs about the food and its sensory qualities (another 38%). In short: how we think about food affects how we eat it, just as much as what's actually in it. This brings us to ultra-processed foods. Despite the intense scrutiny, classifying a food as ""ultra-processed"" added very little to our predictive models. Once we accounted for nutrient content and food perceptions, the Nova classification explained less than 2% of the variation in liking and just 4% in overeating. That's not to say all UPFs are harmless. Many are high in calories, low in fiber and easy to overconsume. But the UPF label is a blunt instrument. It lumps together sugary soft drinks with fortified cereals, protein bars with vegan meat alternatives. Some of these products may be less healthy, but others can be helpful - especially for older adults with low appetites, people on restricted diets or those seeking convenient nutrition. The message that all UPFs are bad oversimplifies the issue. People don't eat based on food labels alone. They eat based on how a food tastes, how it makes them feel and how it fits with their health, social or emotional goals. Relying on UPF labels to shape policy could backfire. Warning labels might steer people away from foods that are actually beneficial, like wholegrain cereals, or create confusion about what's genuinely unhealthy. Instead, we recommend a more informed, personalized approach: Boost food literacy: help people understand what makes food satisfying, what drives cravings, and how to recognize their personal cues for overeating. Reformulate with intention: design food products that are enjoyable and filling, rather than relying on bland ""diet"" options or ultra-palatable snacks. Address eating motivations: people eat for many reasons beyond hunger - for comfort, connection and pleasure. Supporting alternative habits while maximizing enjoyment could reduce dependence on low-quality foods. It's not just about processing Some UPFs do deserve concern. They're calorie dense, aggressively marketed and often sold in oversized portions. But they're not a smoking gun. Labeling entire categories of food as bad based purely on their processing misses the complexity of eating behavior. What drives us to eat and overeat is complicated but not beyond understanding. We now have the data and models to unpack those motivations and support people in building healthier, more satisfying diets. Ultimately, the nutritional and sensory characteristics of food - and how we perceive them - matter more than whether something came out of a packet. If we want to encourage better eating habits, it's time to stop demonizing food groups and start focusing on the psychology behind our choices.

Teoscar Hernández and Max Muncy each hit a solo homer as the Dodgers left Milwaukee with a 2-0 advantage in the best-of-seven series, which shifts to Los Angeles for Game 3 on Thursday. Muncy's 412-foot drive to center field was the 14th homer of his postseason career, breaking the Dodgers record he had shared with Corey Seager and Justin Turner . Yamamoto allowed a home run to Jackson Chourio on the first of his 111 pitches but shut down the Brewers the rest of the way. The right-hander's complete game was his first in the majors and the first in the postseason since Justin Verlander did it for Houston against the New York Yankees in Game 2 of the 2017 ALCS. The last Dodgers pitcher to throw complete game in the postseason was Jose Lima against the St. Louis Cardinals in Game 3 of the 2004 NL Division Series.

The Seattle Mariners own a 2-0 lead in the ALCS heading into Game 3 on Wednesday in Seattle. Twenty-four of the previous 27 teams that took the first two games on the road in a best-of-seven series with a 2-3-2 format have gone on to win. The three teams to come back after losing Games 1 and 2 at home all came in World Series: the 1985 Kansas City Royals against the Cardinals, the 1986 New York Mets against the Boston Red Sox , and the 1996 New York Yankees against the Atlanta Braves . The Brewers pulled out all the stops Tuesday as they tried to avoid that 2-0 deficit. Former Milwaukee slugger Eric Thames got on the field to exhort fans just before the game and popped open his jersey to reveal his bare chest. The 21-year-old Chourio then delighted a sellout crowd by sending Yamamoto's first pitch over the wall in right-center field for his fourth career postseason homer, tying Orlando Arcia and Prince Fielder for the Brewers record. That seemed like a foreboding start for Yamamoto, who lasted just two-thirds of an inning in an 8-1 loss the previous time he pitched in Milwaukee. But he bounced back and silenced the Brewers the rest of the way. The Brewers have five hits in the series. Los Angeles left-hander Blake Snell limited them to one hit and no walks over eight innings in the Dodgers' 2-1 Game 1 victory . Yoshinobu Yamamoto's complete game was his first in the majors and the first in the postseason since Justin Verlander did it for Houston in the 2017 ALCS.

After Chourio's homer, Los Angeles wasted no time coming back against Brewers ace Freddy Peralta . Hernández, whose baserunning mistake contributed to the Brewers' unusual 8-6-2 double play in Game 1 , sent a 3-2 curve over the left-field wall for his fourth homer of this postseason. Two outs later, Kiké Hernández singled and scored on Andy Pages' double. Pages had been 1 for 27 in the postseason before delivering his shot into the right-field corner. Muncy extended the lead to 3-1 with his two-out homer in the sixth, which came on Peralta's 97th and final pitch of the night.

But the Arkansas coach also said he would leave when he can no longer do the job the way he wants. ""I want to help 25 to 30 more families,"" Calipari said during SEC media day Tuesday. ""The only way you do that is to be transformational as a coach. If you're not, you're transactional. If I become transactional -- 'I'm going to pay you this to do this and that' -- then I won't do this anymore. I don't need to."" Although Arkansas added key players -- such as five-star recruit Darius Acuff -- the program also lost standout talents to the transfer portal, including Boogie Fland (Florida) and Zvonimir Ivisic (Illinois). In his attempt to avoid the turnover many teams have experienced, Calipari has warned his players that entering the portal means their time with the Razorbacks is over, even if they have second thoughts. ""That's why if someone puts their name in the portal, I say, 'You're not coming back,' because it's not going to be transactional."" Calipari said he still had the same passion to coach and any observer of his practices at Arkansas would see that he was still ""connected"" to his players. He also said he planned to stay in college basketball because he wanted to make positive changes for the next generation of coaches, which includes his son, Arkansas assistant Brad Calipari.

The portal might offer immediate benefits to those who enter it, Calipari said, but he worries about what comes next for some of those who've bounced around to multiple schools and failed to establish those connections. ""I don't mind kids transferring,"" he said. ""You just can't transfer four times, because it's not good for you. Four schools in four years, you'll never have a college degree.

Gillette Stadium in Foxborough, Massachusetts, home to the NFL's New England Patriots and about 30 miles from Boston, is set to stage seven matches as the U.S. co-hosts the 2026 World Cup with Mexico and Canada. Trump was asked about the city's mayor, Michelle Wu, a Democrat whom he called ""intelligent"" but ""radical left."" ""We could take them away,"" Trump said of the games. ""I love the people of Boston, and I know the games are sold out. But your mayor is not good."" He suggested ""they're taking over parts of Boston"" without offering details, but added ""we could get them back in about two seconds."" Wu's office issued a statement that read, ""Boston is honored and excited to host World Cup matches, and we look forward to welcoming fans from around the world to our beautiful city, the cradle of liberty and city of champions."" Trump's comments came during his meeting with Argentina's president, and it wasn't immediately clear what he was referring to. Earlier this month, however, there were multiple arrests in connection with a pro-Palestinian protest that turned violent on the Boston Common in which four police officers were injured. Trump has previously suggested he could declare cities ""not safe"" for the 104-game soccer tournament and alter a detailed hosting plan that FIFA confirmed in 2022. It includes NFL stadiums near New York, Los Angeles and San Francisco. World Cup host sites aren't up to Trump. The 11 U.S. cities -- plus three in Mexico and two in Canada -- are contracted with FIFA, which would face significant logistical and legal issues to make changes in the eight months before the June 11 kickoff. ""It's FIFA's tournament, FIFA's jurisdiction; FIFA makes those decisions,"" the soccer body's vice president Victor Montagliani said earlier this month at a sports business conference in London. Nonetheless, Trump said: ""If somebody is doing a bad job, and if I feel there's unsafe conditions, I would call Gianni -- the head of FIFA who's phenomenal -- and I would say, 'Let's move into another location' and they would do that."" The president was referring to Gianni Infantino, FIFA head and a close ally.

2f07d39db4ce,"Sources: USC, Michigan question proposed Big Ten private capital deal",,"The Big Ten's proposed $2 billion-plus private capital deal is facing headwinds after a joint meeting Tuesday afternoon between trustees at Michigan and USC led to unified questions about the plan, multiple sources who were on the call told ESPN. The two schools discussed their shared skepticism during the call. One sticking point: The deal doesn't address the root issue -- soaring costs -- that has made the need for cash so imperative for athletic departments. Just providing short-term money, sources said, does not solve that issue. The schools also noted pending federal legislation that makes predicting the future of college athletics difficult, as well as a general apprehension at selling equity in a university asset (the conference media rights). Both Michigan and USC believe there are funding options that can provide superior terms and would like to slow the process and explore them, sources said. The goal, the meeting agreed, should be to help the Big Ten schools that need money but at the most favorable terms imaginable without giving up equity. Although the questions are numerous, it is not certain how much influence the trustees can yield on the proposal, let alone change or even stop the process. The complicated agreement remains fluid and continues to be negotiated and worked on, meaning despite the current opposition, a deal still might be worked out. That said, having two of the league's biggest and most storied athletic brands against it is not insignificant. The framework of the groundbreaking deal would send a significant infusion of money (in the range of $100 million at minimum) to each of the Big Ten schools. In exchange, the league would spin off a new entity, Big Ten Enterprises, which would hold all leaguewide television rights and sponsorship contracts through 2046. Individual schools still would retain local radio and other deals. Shares of ownership in Big Ten Enterprises would fall to the league's 18 schools, the conference office and the capital group -- an investment fund that's tied to the University of California pension system. The UC pension fund would receive a 10% stake in Big Ten Enterprises and would hold typical minority investor rights but no direct control, according to sources. The exact equity amounts per school in Big Ten Enterprises are still being negotiated. There is expected to be a small difference in percentage of the remaining equity between the schools that would favor the league's biggest athletic brands, but it is likely to be less than a percentage point. There is also expected to be a tier system for initial payments, with the lowest amount in the nine-figure range. Larger athletic departments could receive an amount above $150 million. The deal would call for an extension of the league's grant of rights through 2046, providing long-term stability for the league and making both further expansion and any chance league schools leave for the formation of a so-called super league unlikely. A conference-wide call with league presidents and athletic directors on the deal was tentatively planned for Thursday, but there might be more work to be done before then if winning Michigan and USC over is possible. No official vote has been scheduled. ""Setting up a structure that can maximize that activity is important,"" Big Ten commissioner Tony Petitti said last week at the league's basketball media days. ""Whether or not we need a strategic investment to help us, we'll determine. But it'll be done by all 18 leaders, and I think it's no different than looking at the other buckets that we have to maximize resources. It's one other avenue that may or may not be available to us."" Although governance over campuses varies by institution, both USC and Michigan have interim presidents, meaning their boards of trustees might carry more influence than normal, especially on a 10-figure deal that could span decades. The pension fund is not a private equity firm, which has been attractive to the Big Ten and its schools. The UC fund valuation proved to be higher than other competing bids, per sources, which made it attractive. The money infusion is believed to be acutely needed at a number of Big Ten schools that are struggling with debt service on new construction, rising operational expenses and providing additional scholarships and direct revenue ($20.5 million this year and expected to rise annually) to athletes. Just this week, Penn State terminated the contract of football coach James Franklin and could owe as much as $49 million, although that figure could be mitigated lower.

cefd0c5fcda1,Christian Pulisic subbed off early in U.S. win over Australia,,"Oct 14, 2025, 09:45 PM ET Christian Pulisic was subbed out of the United States ' 2-1 friendly win over Australia before the 30-minute mark at Dick's Sporting Goods Park in Commerce City, Colorado, Tuesday. The U.S. star was fouled from behind by Jason Geria in the 28th minute before needing treatment on the field and then being taken out of the game. Geria was shown a yellow card for the foul. After handing the captain's armband to teammate Chris Richards , Pulisic was seen walking toward the dressing room with U.S. staff. He was replaced by Real Salt Lake forward Diego Luna. Australia was leading the match 1-0 when Pulisic left the game, but the U.S. levelled the score shortly after with a goal from Haji Wright that made it 1-1 going into the break. Wright scored a lovely second goal after halftime, again with an assist from Cristian Roldan, to hand the U.S. a first come-from-behind win under Mauricio Pochettino. Pulisic's availability for the game was in question after he injured his ankle while training with the USMNT ahead of its game against Ecuador on Friday. It's unclear what the nature of Pulisic's injury was, but he was grabbing his right ankle when U.S. staff was tending to him on the field. The AC Milan attacker came on as a substitute in the 1-1 draw with Ecuador and was named in Pochettino's starting lineup for the friendly with Australia.",https://www.espn.com/soccer/story/_/id/46598726/christian-pulisic-subbed-usmnt-friendly-australia,Sport,BBC,,https://a1.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2025%2F1015%2Fr1560338_1024x576_16%2D9.jpg,,643384ffa7654d1d0d1ed727e335b54965283713
e4daf3438391,MLB,,"Oct 14, 2025, 09:51 PM ET Alex Bregman plans to opt out of his contract with the Boston Red Sox , according to multiple reports Tuesday night. The move, first reported by the New York Post , was expected and doesn't rule out the veteran third baseman returning to Boston, but for now, he'll be part of a free agent class for a second straight offseason. Last offseason, the 31-year-old didn't find a home until the start of spring training, when he agreed to a three-year, $120 million deal with the Red Sox in mid-February that included opt-outs after 2025 and '26. He got off to a fast start in Boston, hitting .299 with 11 homers and 35 RBIs before suffering a quad injury that sidelined him from May 24 to July 11. He finished the season with a .273 average, 18 home runs and 62 RBIs. Off the field, he was praised for his veteran leadership on a young Red Sox team that lost in three games to the New York Yankees in the AL Wild Card Series. After the team's postseason exit, Red Sox chief baseball officer Craig Breslow declined to say whether contract discussions were already ongoing with Bregman's agent, Scott Boras. ""Obviously, Alex has the right as structured in his contract to opt out, and he's going to do what's best for his family,"" Breslow said Oct. 6. ""At the same time, I will not miss an opportunity to talk about his contributions on the field, in the clubhouse, to the coaching staff, to the front office. Every conversation we've had I think I've learned something about how his impact and influence have rubbed off on his teammates."" Red Sox shortstop Trevor Story also has an opt-out in his deal after inking a six-year, $140 million contract with the team in March 2022. If Story exercises his player option, the Red Sox will have the right to exercise the club option then and make the deal worth $160 million over seven seasons.",https://www.espn.com/mlb/story/_/id/46598790/reports-alex-bregman-plans-opt-red-sox-contract,Sport,BBC,,https://a4.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2025%2F0720%2Fr1521467_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg,,af7d9c07d563f1e44f6d88942f7e8a2d654b3172

c1e0c937e71c,Lawyer argues Angels responsible for Skaggs' overdose death,,"SANTA ANA, Calif. -- Questions surrounding the Los Angeles Angels ' culpability in the overdose death of pitcher Tyler Skaggs in 2019 sat at the center of opening statements in the long-awaited wrongful death civil trial Tuesday. Shawn Holley, the attorney delivering the plaintiff's opening statement, blamed the Angels for Skaggs' death and said the franchise put him ""directly in harm's way"" because of Eric Kay's continued employment. Kay, a former communication director for the Angels, was convicted in 2022 of providing the fentanyl-laced oxycodone pill that killed Skaggs. He is serving 22 years in prison. The Angels' attorney, Todd Theodora, insisted the team was not aware of Skaggs' drug issues or that Kay had been providing Skaggs with pills. Instead, Theodora argued Skaggs died due ""to his reckless decision to mix large amounts of alcohol with narcotics on the night he died."" ""Angels Baseball did not kill Tyler Skaggs, and Angels Baseball only wishes that he could have come forward and told us about his struggles,"" Theodora said. ""Told us about his challenges with drugs and we could have helped him."" Skaggs' widow, Carli, and his mother sat in the courtroom behind their team of attorneys, led by Rusty Hardin. Carli Skaggs and the parents of Tyler Skaggs filed suit against the Angels in 2021. Holley said in her opening statement they are seeking $118 million for Tyler Skaggs' estimated loss of earnings as well as damages for the Skaggs family's suffering and punitive damage against the Angels. Angels owner Arte Moreno sat in the first row of the gallery behind the Angels' attorneys, next to team president John Carpino. Moreno stared mostly straight ahead during both opening statements, occasionally glancing at both attorneys. Attorneys for the Angels and the Skaggs family presented vastly differing opening statements about the arguments of facts in the case and what the evidence would show the jury. ""If you just wanted to go out and look at two different people at the same accident scene and get 180-degree different views,"" Hardin said as he left the courtroom, ""today was the day."" Holley gave a 52-minute opening statement in which she put the blame of Skaggs' death clearly on the Angels. Theodora, the lead attorney for the Angels, gave a 58-minute opening statement focused on the argument the Angels were not aware of Skaggs' illicit drug usage, they were unaware Kay had provided pills to Skaggs and that Skaggs made a ""reckless decision"" leading to his death. Holley listed multiple times the Angels were made aware of Kay's drug issues dating to 2013. That included stints in rehabilitation and showing up ""high, very high"" to work. Holley said jurors would hear testimony about an Angels clubhouse employee witnessing Kay snorting lines in the clubhouse kitchen in 2016 and a 2017 intervention when Angels public relations head Tim Mead showed up to Kay's home, seeing pills in individual baggies. ""That sort of packaging was indicative of selling drugs,"" Holley said. ""...The Angels now knew."" Holley said testimony would show Kay's addiction being ""on full display"" in 2018, including at work for the Angels, and how in 2019 the Angels' human resources department asked Kay to see an addiction specialist. Less than two months after returning to work, Kay was on the trip to Texas with Skaggs and the Angels when Kay provided the fentanyl-laced pill to Skaggs. ""It was a tragedy,"" Holley said, ""... that could have been prevented by the Angels."" Angels players placed their jerseys with No. 45 in honor of pitcher Tyler Skaggs on the mound after a combined no-hitter two weeks after his death in 2019. AP Photo/Marcio Jose Sanchez Holley argued the Angels ignored the team's drug policies when it came to Kay while also pointing out other employees who were suspended or dismissed when drug or alcohol usage was discovered. Theodora said the franchise was aware of Kay's bipolar diagnosis and a family history with mental illness. Theodora said the Angels offered him help to manage the diagnosis and any medication issues that arose from it. Theodora said Kay ""was the best we've ever seen him"" following his outpatient treatment and that there was no reason to terminate him because Kay's treatment was tied to prescription medication. As part of his opening, Theodora showed photos of the desk in Skaggs' hotel room the night he died, including a magenta room key with drug remnants on it and a snorting straw used for the oxycodone and fentanyl. Theodora also presented the autopsy report showing the levels of oxycodone, fentanyl and alcohol in Skaggs' system. ""Really, this is a simple case,"" Theodora said. ""Tyler, and Tyler alone, decided to obtain the illicit pills and take the illicit drugs along with the alcohol the night he died."" Theodora said multiple times the Angels wished Skaggs had told them about any drug issues because ""we could have helped him."" He also said the Angels suspended and ultimately fired Kay after learning he had been in Skaggs' hotel room on the night of his death. Theodora said their evidence would prove Skaggs used illicit drugs when he was with the Arizona Diamondbacks before joining the Angels and that multiple former Angels players (including Matt Harvey) and current players (including star outfielder Mike Trout ) would either testify or have testimony read about Kay or Skaggs. The oxycodone was not prescribed to Skaggs, Theodora said, and the fentanyl was a ""counterfeit"" pill, which was provided by Kay. Theodora said the amounts of oxycodone and fentanyl were in therapeutic ranges but that the addition of alcohol -- 11 to 13 drinks -- created a lethal combination. ""It was the mixture,"" Theodora said, ""of this much alcohol with this much oxycodone with this much fentanyl that caused Tyler's death."" The case, which is expected to take six weeks, will continue Wednesday morning with the anticipated testimony of Mead, the first of the trial.

768d59528820,2026 NFL draft Big Board rankings: Mel Kiper's top prospects,,"We're now seven weeks into the 2025 college football season , and the top names in the 2026 NFL draft class are starting to emerge from the pack. I've spent the past few months watching tape on the best players eligible to get drafted, and I'm ready to roll out my debut top-25 Big Board ranking. Of course, the class will change a ton between now and April 23, when Round 1 begins in Pittsburgh. But for now, this is how I see the top of the class, starting with a talented QB prospect. I will keep this list updated throughout the rest of the season and into predraft events. I have scouting reports for the top 25 overall, and I have stacked the best of the best at every position at the bottom. A key note to please remember: This is not a mock draft or a prediction of where players will be drafted. These are my personal rankings based on talent -- the best players based on what I'm seeing and my own evaluations. Let's get started. (Underclassmen are marked with an asterisk.) Jump to Kiper's positional rankings Height: 6-foot-3 | Weight: 206 2025 stats over six games: 72.0% completion rate, 1,396 passing yards, 15 TD passes, 3 INTs Moore is a third-year sophomore with some impressive traits. His accuracy has been solid all season, and he shows good touch on his deep ball. Moore can throw from different arm angles with precision and delivers strikes while rolling either left or right out of the pocket. He can scramble a bit too. Moore started five games at UCLA in 2023 before sitting behind Dillon Gabriel in 2024, so he has only 11 career starts to date. Moore is still developing and will be only 20 years old at draft time. But the toolbox is loaded, and he plays with true command of the Ducks' offense. I see a lot of confidence in Moore's game; nothing ever seems to faze him. Height: 6-0 | Weight: 214 2025 stats over six games: 100 carries, 530 rushing yards, 8 rushing TDs, 14 catches, 160 receiving yards, 3 receiving TDs Love reminds me a lot of Reggie Bush. The 20-year-old has vision and burst between the tackles and to the outside, and he can break tackles with ease (29 forced missed tackles on the season). Once he gets into space, he can take it to the house with his breakaway speed too. But Love isn't only an outstanding runner. He also is a high-impact pass catcher. An NFL team will be able to flank him out wide and create a whole other dimension of the offense. Height: 6-5 | Weight: 225 2025 stats over six games: 71.2% completion rate, 1,423 passing yards, 17 TD passes, 2 INTs, 2 rushing TDs Mendoza transferred to Indiana after playing two seasons at Cal, and his game has taken off. The key? He has cut down on sacks, with only six so far this season after taking 41 in 2024. Mendoza is getting the ball out quicker. And while he doesn't have a huge arm, he can make all the necessary NFL-level throws. His ball placement is fantastic. I wouldn't consider him a dual threat, but Mendoza also has enough mobility to pick up first downs as a scrambler. Height: 6-4 | Weight: 243 2025 stats over six games: 38 tackles, 4 tackles for loss, 4.5 sacks, 3 run stops, 2 pass breakups This is a complete football player. Reese jumps off the Ohio State tape, playing the game like a veteran. I see natural instincts at the linebacker position that allow him to make plays most guys just can't make, and he has the burst to get home when turned loose as a pass rusher. Reese has been a big riser in this class. Height: 6-3 | Weight: 315 2025 stats over six games: 18 tackles, 1.5 tackles for loss, 0.5 sacks, 3 pressures, 4 run stops, 2 pass breakups Woods hasn't been elite in 2025, but the skill set is exactly what NFL teams covet. He just needs to finish strong over the second half of the season. In the pros, Woods would fit nicely at 3-technique, though he has the versatility to move around on a defensive front. He plays on the inside the majority of the time, but he also can be disruptive off the edge. His strength will intrigue a lot of NFL teams no matter where he lines up. Height: 5-11 | Weight: 195 2025 stats over six games: 44 catches, 682 receiving yards, 6 receiving TDs This kid is a warrior who plays with passion. I'd want Lemon on my roster. He snatches the ball away from his body in an attacking manner then runs with a fierce approach after the catch. He is one of my favorite players in the class, and he currently ranks second in the nation in receiving yards. Height: 6-0 | Weight: 205 2025 stats over five games: 22 tackles, 2 tackles for loss, 1 INT Downs -- the brother of NFL wide receiver Josh Downs and the son of former NFL running back Gary Downs -- is basically an extension of the defensive coordinator. His football knowledge shows in his play; it's obvious when you watch him in the Ohio State defense. But what really impressed me is how well he picked up Nick Saban's system as a 2023 freshman at Alabama before transferring. He diagnoses quickly thanks to excellent pre-snap instincts, and that allows him to play faster than his straight-line speed might suggest. Plus, Downs is solid in coverage, and he is a very reliable open-field tackler. play 3:31 How Caleb Downs developed his football IQ at a young age Ohio State safety Caleb Downs discusses how he took his game to the next level by honing his football IQ in both conventional and unconventional means. Height: 6-2 | Weight: 200 2025 stats over six games: 47 catches, 523 receiving yards, 7 receiving TDs The Colorado transfer has teamed up with quarterback Sam Leavitt to light up defenses for two seasons now. Tyson's superpower is being open even when it looks like he's completely blanketed. It makes him essentially uncoverable in the red zone. He wins on 50-50 balls and outmuscles defensive backs. His 116 receiving yards after first contact rank inside the top 20 nationwide. Height: 6-3 | Weight: 275 2025 stats over five games: 31 tackles, 4 tackles for loss, 2 sacks, 24 pressures, 3 run stops, 1 forced fumble, 1 INT Bain is powerful and has really strong hands. He routinely gets the best of some very good offensive tackles, often with his dominant rip move, and he knows every trick in the book in getting home to the QB. Bain also shows speed and bend off the edge, and he takes good angles. Plus, he can hold the edge against the run and get off blocks to chase down ball carriers. His tape is just filled with disruption. But even with all those A-level traits, it's actually Bain's hustle that really stands out to me. He never takes a play off and fires at the ball on every play. His arms are shorter than most scouts prefer, but there's so much to like with his game. Opponents have to account for him in their game plans, and he can keep them guessing even then with his inside-outside flexibility. Height: 6-6 | Weight: 302 2025 stats over five games: 5 starts, 0 sacks allowed Fano started 12 games at left tackle in 2023 before moving to the right side in 2024, and he has started 17 games there over two seasons. Working opposite another highly regarded bookend in Caleb Lomu , Fano does a great job of keeping his big frame between the pass rusher and his QB. He is technically sound and shows good punch to compensate for his lack of ideal arm length. Height: 6-6 | Weight: 285 2025 stats over five games: 16 tackles, 3.5 tackles for loss, 2 sacks, 14 pressures, 5 run stops If you could draw up the perfect NFL 4-3 defensive end, it would be Faulk. He's what I call an ""LTPer"" -- someone who looks the part. He can win with outside and inside moves, and he moves blockers with his super powerful hands. I see good overall instincts on tape too. Faulk makes his presence felt against the run and the pass, and he is scheme versatile. Height: 6-3 | Weight: 195 2025 stats over six games: 28 catches, 476 receiving yards, 4 receiving TDs Ohio State has turned into Wide Receiver U, with Emeka Egbuka being the most recent star wideout to come out of Columbus. And while most of the college football world focuses on Jeremiah Smith (who isn't eligible for the 2026 draft), Tate is putting up some serious numbers and showing why he is a top prospect for this class. Tate has produced big plays on a regular basis, averaging 17 yards per catch this season. He is a precise route runner, has great hands and displays outstanding body control. And he'll also happily block for ball carriers, which NFL coaches love to see. Height: 6-0 | Weight: 193 McCoy hasn't played yet in 2025 after suffering a torn ACL in January, but he still has the chance to be the first cornerback off the board in April. He began his college career at Oregon State, picking off two passes there in 2023. McCoy's ball-hawking traits really emerged once transferring to Tennessee, as he picked off four passes and broke up nine last season. Even if he doesn't make it back onto the field this season, his on-the-ball production will get Day 1 interest. Height: 6-3 | Weight: 245 2025 stats over six games: 17 catches, 225 receiving yards, 3 receiving TDs Sadiq is loaded with physical traits. He has the explosion to hurdle defenders in the open field. He has the vision and speed to cause conflict after the catch, with more than half his 2025 yardage coming after the ball is in his hands. And he's nearly impossible to match against because of his quickness and size. Sadiq has been consistent this season, and he could be the first tight end off the board. Height: 6-3 | Weight: 265 2025 stats over six games: 22 tackles, 5.5 tackles for loss, 2 sacks, 14 pressures, 6 run stops Like teammate Peter Woods , Parker hasn't been as productive in 2025 as he was in 2024 (11 sacks, 16.5 tackles for loss). But there's still a lot to like in Parker's profile, and at his best, he's a sack artist. He can play staying up or with his hand in the dirt, and he beats blockers with outstanding speed-to-power and active hands. I love Parker's ability to make plays in pursuit; when his initial charge is thwarted, he redirects and quickly finds another way to pressure the QB. Height: 6-2 | Weight: 208 2025 stats over six games: 70.9% completion rate, 1,678 passing yards, 16 TD passes, 1 INT, 2 rushing TDs His lack of experience might be a concern, as Simpson didn't start a game until this season, but the production is hard to ignore. Simpson knows the game and competes on every down. He's a battler who is always trying to make a play -- sometimes to his detriment. And Simpson maneuvers well in the pocket and can beat defenses with his legs when the passing play isn't there. play 0:31 Horton's 16-yard TD catch puts Alabama on top Ty Simpson connects with Isaiah Horton for a 16-yard touchdown pass to give Alabama the lead. Height: 5-11 | Weight: 180 2025 stats over five games: 19 tackles, 2.5 tackles for loss, 6 pass breakups, 3 forced fumbles Terrell is a proven cover man, much like his brother, A.J. Terrell Jr. of the Atlanta Falcons . Avieon is consistent and reliable in man coverage. He can flip his hips, turn and run with the fastest wideouts, and still be able to locate the ball in the air to make the play at the right moment. He had 12 pass breakups last season, and he is limiting opponents to 3.6 yards per attempt in his direction this season (top 40 in the nation). Height: 6-6 | Weight: 315 2025 stats over five games: 5 starts, 1 sack allowed Here's a true mauler. Mauigoa is fun to watch for the way he just destroys pass rushers at the point of attack. He has more than 2,000 snaps at right tackle and has the pass protection skill to stick there, but he could absolutely slide inside and become a Pro Bowl-caliber guard at the next level. Mauigoa has allowed one sack and blown only five run blocks since the start of last season. Height: 6-3 | Weight: 330 2025 stats over six games: 17 tackles, 2.5 tackles for loss, 1 sack, 4 run stops Washington is putting it all together. He is powerful. He's quick and explosive. He's tough as nails. Teams are going to be interested in that combination, even if his game is still a little raw, with no career starts before this season. Washington can clog up the middle against the run, and he can power through with his bull rush to get interior pressure. We saw such a sack in Oregon's Week 7 game against Indiana . He is very difficult to contain at the point of attack. Washington is still developing, and he could continue to rise up boards before April. Height: 6-3 | Weight: 250 2025 stats over six games: 29 tackles, 9 tackles for loss, 8.5 sacks, 25 pressures, 2 run stops, 2 forced fumbles A transfer from Stanford, Bailey gets after the quarterback. He had 14.5 sacks over three seasons for the Cardinal, and he has notably become more of a finisher this season. His 23.4% pressure rate leads the nation, and he is up to 8.5 sacks in just six games with the Red Raiders, unlocking another level of his game. Height: 6-3 | Weight: 240 2025 stats over six games: 64.0% completion rate, 1,010 passing yards, 4 TD passes, 2 INTs, 1 rushing TD Sellers has all the talent in the world when it comes to physical traits. The redshirt sophomore has great size for the QB position, a live arm and the mobility to pick up chunks of yardage on the ground (284 rushing yards in 2025). I've heard comps to Josh Allen and Cam Newton . But Sellers hasn't translated all those traits into consistent production. His ball location has been erratic, and his decision-making still isn't there. On top of that, he has taken 19 sacks, seventh-most in the FBS. Sellers is still developing as a prospect, but you can't teach his skill set. There will be teams that get excited about his potential. play 0:20 LaNorris Sellers barrels in for South Carolina's first TD of season LaNorris Sellers plows his way in for a touchdown on South Carolina's opening drive against Virginia Tech. Height: 5-10 | Weight: 180 2025 stats over six games: 27 catches, 291 receiving yards, 2 receiving TDs Branch doesn't have ideal size, but he has a track background and is lightning quick. He reminds me a little of Zay Flowers . Branch plays the game at a different speed than everyone else, and it is why he's so effective in space. A transfer from USC, he can take a short completion for a big gain with his explosive skill set, averaging 10.6 yards after the catch per reception (22nd in the country). And Branch also is a dynamic returner, which will help his draft stock. 23. CJ Allen , LB, Georgia* Height: 6-1 | Weight: 235 2025 stats over six games: 48 tackles, 4.5 tackles for loss, 3 sacks, 6 run stops, 2 forced fumbles, 3 pass breakups Allen is a three-down linebacker at the next level because his read-and-react skills are excellent and he can make plays in all three aspects of the defense. He has the physicality to take on blocks in the run game and the speed to chase down ball carriers once he disengages. He has the burst to blitz and get to the QB. And he can drop and defend in coverage, with nine pass breakups and an interception over the past two campaigns. Height: 6-4 | Weight: 200 2025 stats over five games: 18 catches, 313 receiving yards, 2 receiving TDs Despite missing time with an injury and topping 40 receiving yards just twice in five games this season, Lane should stick in the first-round mix. He is a silky smooth mover with the length, explosion and strong hands to high-point the football and come down with it. Smaller cornerbacks won't be able to handle him on the outside. Seven of his 12 touchdown grabs from 2024 came in the red zone, where he is able to use his big frame to his advantage.

d2317fd9db81,NHL,,"It takes more than one elite player to win the Stanley Cup. The repeat champion Florida Panthers continue to prove that is true -- and the results of the NHL Rank poll for the 2025-26 season bear that out. We asked a panel of ESPN broadcasters, analysts, reporters and editors to rate players based on how good they will be this season compared with their peers. Emphasis was placed on their value for this coming season, which explains why players who are out injured (but expected to return) might be lower than if they were healthy now. In the case of the Panthers, this put Matthew Tkachuk a bit lower than usual, while Aleksander Barkov (who is expected to miss the regular season, if not longer) did not make the cut in the top 100. Nevertheless, the defending champs put six players in the top 100, which was behind only the Dallas Stars ' seven for most players to make the list. As for individuals, Connor McDavid continued his reign as the top vote-getter, holding down the No. 1 spot again, as he did for 2024-25 and 2023-24 and 2022-22 and 2021-22 and ... you get the idea. Here's the 1-100 list for 2025-26, featuring write-ups courtesy of ESPN reporters Ryan S. Clark, Kristen Shilton, Greg Wyshynski and editorial staff. 2024-25 rank: 1 Age: 28 Simply put, McDavid is the best player on the planet, the best player of his generation, and could finish his career as one of the best to ever touch a puck. An eight-time 100-point scorer, McDavid has captained the Oilers to consecutive Stanley Cup Finals; this season, the objective is having Edmonton win its first title since 1990. -- Clark 2024-25 rank: 4 Age: 26 Many types of players are needed to win in the NHL. Among them, a puck-moving defenseman who can also be trusted to play heavy minutes in every scenario. Makar is just that, as the two-time Norris Trophy winner (given to the NHL's best defenseman) is trusted to drive play in every scenario. -- Clark 2024-25 rank: 3 Age: 30 The Avalanche? Team Canada? It doesn't matter. Any team that has MacKinnon is going to pose a serious threat to win on a nightly basis. His combination of control, power, speed and unpredictability has made him one of the best in the world. Like McDavid, he has a chance to win a gold medal and a Stanley Cup in the same season. Unlike McDavid, the Cup would be his second after the Avs' win in 2022. -- Clark 2024-25 rank: 9 Age: 30 Since 2022-23, Draisaitl is second in goals scored (146) and goals per game (0.63). He is a dominating offensive star who long ago put to bed the notion that he was simply a product of his teammate, Connor McDavid. -- Wyshynski 2024-25 rank: 2 Age: 32 Kucherov led the NHL in points for a second consecutive season and for the third time since 2019. He can either score goals or create them for his teammates, which has been integral to the Lightning winning two titles during his time with the only club he has ever known. -- Clark 2024-25 rank: 31 Age: 32 Only four goalies in the NHL's expansion era (since 1967) have won the Hart Trophy as league MVP; Hellebuyck joined the fraternity in 2025, taking his spot with Carey Price , Jose Theodore and Dominik Hasek . Can Hellebuyck join Hasek as the only goaltenders to pull off the feat two years in a row? -- ESPN staff 2024-25 rank: 12 Age: 26 Suggesting that Hughes can do everything asked of a contemporary defenseman isn't an overstatement. The consistency he has shown in every scenario has made him one of the game's best players, and someone who could be instrumental in the United States' chase for a gold medal at the Olympics. -- Clark 2024-25 rank: 6 Age: 28 There aren't many goal scorers who are as pure as Matthews, who possess the sort of shot every player covets. He has tallied 30-plus goals in every season of his career -- despite injuries -- and does it all for the Leafs as a standout 200-foot center. -- Shilton 2024-25 rank: 16 Age: 29 Talent has never been the question with Eichel. But last season, he unlocked aspects of his game that have made him one of the most complete centers in hockey. He'll help push his team to capture its second title since 2023, while also helping the U.S. in its push for Olympic gold. -- Clark All of ESPN. All in one place. Watch your favorite events in the newly enhanced ESPN App. Learn more about what plan is right for you. Sign Up Now 2024-25 rank: 8 Age: 29 Could his first full season in Dallas be the one that sees the Stars win the Stanley Cup that has eluded them over the past few years? Rantanen left Colorado in the NHL's biggest trade last season and then made his way back to the Central Division in a subsequent deal. But with a long-term pact in hand, he'll be a key player for the Stars for the foreseeable future. -- Clark 2024-25 rank: 11 Age: 29 Pastrnak has scored over 40 goals in four consecutive seasons. Given his career total with the Bruins (391 entering this season), he could move all the way to third in franchise history if he notches another 40 goals in 2025-26. -- Wyshynski 2024-25 rank: 27 Age: 31 Some might have surmised that Vasilevskiy was heading into a decline based on 2023-24, when his save percentage dipped to .900 after seven straight seasons at .915 or higher. The 2024-25 campaign ended that talk, as he registered a .921 mark along with a 2.18 GAA and 38 wins. The ""Big Cat"" can still roar. -- ESPN staff 2024-25 rank: 30 Age: 29 The Panthers pulled off a unique feat last season, placing two players in the top two spots in Selke Trophy voting. Florida captain Aleksander Barkov -- who won the award -- is likely out until April (if not longer), meaning Reinhart and others will have to pick up the slack on both ends of the ice. The scoring part won't be a problem, as Reinhart has 127 goals in the past three seasons combined. -- ESPN staff 2024-25 rank: 26 Age: 29 A one-time Vezina Trophy winner (for now), Shesterkin is easily the best player drafted at No. 118 in NHL history. If the Rangers fail to make the postseason again, it won't be because of their superstar goaltender. -- ESPN staff 2024-25 rank: 17 Age: 28 All anyone needs to know about Kaprizov and his value could be seen last season. Before he got hurt, he was among the front-runners for the Hart Trophy, and the Wild looked as if they could win the Central. But an injury meant that Kaprizov played in just 41 regular-season games. The Wild struggled to score goals in his absence before his eventual return helped them capture a wild-card spot. -- Clark 2024-25 rank: 25 Age: 26 Brady Tkachuk captained the Senators to their first Stanley Cup playoff berth since 2017. His goal scoring and physicality will be vital not only to Ottawa in the NHL, but also to Team USA in the 2026 Olympics. -- Wyshynski 2024-25 rank: 23 Age: 34 The 6-7 blueliner remains a dominant presence in both ends of the ice: 66 points in 79 games last season, while using physicality and his considerable wingspan to disrupt opponents in his own zone. -- Wyshynski 2024-25 rank: 14 Age: 28 Marner is the unique skater who dominates individually while also elevating literally any linemate he is paired with. A force on special teams -- his penalty killing is particularly good -- Marner is more likely to try setting up a goal than attempting to score one himself. And the Golden Knights are counting on his playmaking to carry them for years to come -- Shilton 2024-25 rank: 35 Age: 26 Part of the Stars' legendary 2017 draft class (with Miro Heiskanen and Jake Oettinger ), Robertson has 269 points in 246 games the past three regular seasons. His line with Roope Hintz and Mikko Rantanen will be one of the NHL's most dangerous this season. -- ESPN staff 2024-25 rank: 58 Age: 28 The Michigan native removed any sense of uncertainty for next summer by signing a team-record $96 million contract extension on the eve of the season -- then opened the campaign with a hat trick against the Stars. He'll also be a key player for the U.S. in the Olympic Games. -- ESPN staff 2024-25 rank: 13 Age: 38 Father Time? Crosby has never heard of him, apparently. The Penguins captain is playing as well now as he has throughout a legendary career that kept Pittsburgh as a contender for nearly two decades. And Crosby shows no signs of wanting to slow down. -- Shilton 2024-25 rank: 55 Age: 38 Season No. 20 will be the last one in the NHL for Kopitar, by far the best hockey player ever from Slovenia -- he has outscored second-place Jan Mursak 1,281-4 heading into this season. -- ESPN staff 2024-25 rank: 63 Age: 26 The Devils captain built another strong case for a Selke Trophy in 2024-25 and finished fourth in the voting, garnering 11 first-place votes. Another standout season could see him land in the finalists' circle. -- ESPN staff 2024-25 rank: 49 Age: 29 The heart and soul of the Red Wings, Larkin turned heads with his excellent two-way play during the 4 Nations Face-Off. Can he lead the Red Wings back to the postseason? -- ESPN staff 2024-25 rank: 22 Age: 26 There are sitcoms that have episodes with lesser run time than Heiskanen averages in a game. He's frequently in the discussion for the league's best shutdown defenseman, and he'd receive even more acclaim if he had offensive numbers similar to some of his peers. -- Clark 2024-25 rank: 32 Age: 29 With Mitch Marner now plying his trade for the Golden Knights, the Leafs will need continued production out of the elite scorers who remain -- and Nylander is certainly one of them, with 125 goals in the past three seasons combined. -- ESPN staff 2024-25 rank: 34 Age: 31 Forsberg was not immune to whatever plagued the Predators in 2024-25, as his 76 points was a steep decline from 94 the season prior. Will 2025-26 be a rebound for him personally and for his team? -- ESPN staff 2024-25 rank: 19 Age: 28 The top center on the Hurricanes, Aho is a point-per-game offensive player whose defensive play fits the Carolina tradition of two-way play. -- Wyshynski Breaking News from Emily Kaplan Download the ESPN app and enable Emily Kaplan's news alerts to receive push notifications for the latest updates first.

For more information, click here . 2024-25 rank: 62 Age: 40 The greatest goal scorer in NHL history began the 2025-26 campaign with 897 career tallies. How many will he add to his total this season -- and will it be his last in the NHL? -- ESPN staff 2024-25 rank: 64 Age: 27 One of the snubs left off the United States' 4 Nations Face-Off roster, the 27-year-old Thompson has extra motivation to get off to a fast start to get his name on the list for the Olympics. Getting on a pace for 40-plus goals (as he has done twice in his young career) would be a good start. -- ESPN staff 2024-25 rank: 39 Age: 28 Part of the Stars' ""Finnish Mafia,"" Hintz's 200-foot game means that opponents have to construct their game plan around him. -- ESPN staff 2024-25 rank: 21 Age: 29 Point had always been a dangerous offensive player, but his goal scoring has exploded over the past three seasons (139 goals) while taking passes from former league MVP Nikita Kucherov on his wing. -- Wyshynski 2024-25 rank: 24 Age: 26 Does Elias Pettersson still belong among the top 25 players in the NHL? That's what the Canucks star is trying to prove in 2025-26 after injuries and locker room drama contributed to the worst offensive season of his career. -- Wyshynski 2024-25 rank: 18 Age: 31 Jake Guentzel has earned the chance to skate with the greatest. He was Sidney Crosby's linemate for eight seasons in Pittsburgh. Last season, his first with the Lightning, he scored a career-high 41 goals on a line with Nikita Kucherov. -- Wyshynski 2024-25 rank: 33 Age: 26 The man they call ""Otter"" has been everything the Stars wanted after they selected him 26th in the 2017 draft, including 151 wins in 253 career games and a 2.54 GAA. -- ESPN staff 2024-25 rank: 15 Age: 24 When Jack Hughes is in the lineup, he's one of the most gifted playmakers in the NHL, averaging 1.13 points per game last season. The trick has been staying in the lineup, as Hughes has played over 70 games only once in the past four seasons with the Devils. -- Wyshynski 2024-25 rank: 28 Age: 32 The newest captain of the Rangers was brought in to set a new tone as the Blueshirts hope their playoff absence last season was an aberration. -- ESPN staff The enhanced ESPN App Watch your favorite events in the newly upgraded ESPN App. Learn more about what plan is right for you. Sign Up Now 2024-25 rank: 7 Age: 33 The Rangers have had their ups and downs. Panarin has been a spark plug in their offense through it all. His speed, vision and playmaking skills are top end, and when he's consistently contributing, New York can look unstoppable up front. -- Shilton 2024-25 rank: NR Age: 24 The 5-8 scoring winger has earned social media shoutouts from fellow Wisconsin native J.J. Watt and is looking to breach the 40-goal benchmark after notching 37 last season. -- ESPN staff 2024-25 rank: 50 Age: 27 The Chesterfield, Missouri, native is one of the NHL's underappreciated scorers, with 90 points in 81 games last season. That will change if the Mammoth qualify for the postseason this spring. -- ESPN staff 2024-25 rank: 74 Age: 28 Perhaps no player boosted his stock more during the 4 Nations Face-Off than Werenski, who is arguably Columbus' most important player. -- ESPN staff 2024-25 rank: NR Age: 23 A rising star for the Hurricanes and Team Canada -- and on ""FaceOff: Inside the NHL"" -- Jarvis will be a critical player in Carolina's quest for its first Cup since 2006. -- ESPN staff 2024-25 rank: 57 Age: 32 The first player drafted by the Jets 2.0 franchise after relocating from Atlanta, Scheifele continues to fill the stat sheet as both scorer and playmaker. -- ESPN staff 2024-25 rank: 79 Age: 27 Whether Jack Hughes is in the lineup or not, Bratt continues to drive offense for the Devils, with 171 points in 163 games the past two regular seasons. -- ESPN staff 2024-25 rank: 20 Age: 35 What makes him the greatest hockey player Switzerland has ever seen has been the consistency. A threat to reach double figures in goals, Josi is equally effective in the defensive zone, as he has anchored the Preds' defensive setup for more than a decade. -- Clark 2024-25 rank: 85 Age: 29 Kings fans have known of Kempe's scoring prowess for many seasons -- and the ESPN voting panel has finally caught up. As the Kings move on from the Kopitar era beginning next season, Kempe will continue to be a foundational player. -- ESPN staff 2024-25 rank: 83 Age: 37 The legends of ""Playoff Bob"" are many, as the Russian veteran has backstopped the past two Cup champs. But, he continues to be a reliable regular-season netminder as well, with 69 wins and a sub-2.50 GAA the past two seasons combined. -- ESPN staff 2024-25 rank: 86 Age: 23 The latest elite Scandinavian import plying his trade for the Red Wings, Raymond will look to eclipse his career-best 80 points from 2024-25. -- ESPN staff 2024-25 rank: 53 Age: 23 Faber finished second for the Calder Trophy following the 2023-24 season and has become a blue-line bedrock for his home state Wild. -- ESPN staff 2024-25 rank: 71 Age: 23 A near point-per-game player for the past two regular seasons, the 23-year-old native of Germany added five goals in the Sens' six-game return to the playoffs in 2025. -- ESPN staff 2024-25 rank: NR Age: 19 2024-25 rank: 38 Age: 27 2024-25 rank: NR Age: 24 2024-25 rank: NR Age: 35 2024-25 rank: 44 Age: 25 2024-25 rank: NR Age: 22 2024-25 rank: 45 Age: 20 2024-25 rank: 41 Age: 27 2024-25 rank: 88 Age: 27 2024-25 rank: 37 Age: 25 2024-25 rank: 66 Age: 22 2024-25 rank: 46 Age: 25 2024-25 rank: HM Age: 26 2024-25 rank: 68 Age: 29 2024-25 rank: 48 Age: 37 2024-25 rank: 60 Age: 30 2024-25 rank: 72 Age: 35 2024-25 rank: 96 Age: 31 2024-25 rank: 95 Age: 26 2024-25 rank: NR Age: 26 2024-25 rank: 42 Age: 28 2024-25 rank: 5 Age: 27 2024-25 rank: 82 Age: 31 2024-25 rank: NR Age: 20 2024-25 rank: NR Age: 31 2024-25 rank: 90 Age: 29 2024-25 rank: NR Age: 21 2024-25 rank: NR Age: 27 2024-25 rank: 43 Age: 30 2024-25 rank: 29 Age: 33 2024-25 rank: NR Age: 24 2024-25 rank: HM Age: 26 2024-25 rank: 40 Age: 35 2024-25 rank: 59 Age: 24 2024-25 rank: NR Age: 31 2024-25 rank: NR Age: 23 2024-25 rank: NR Age: 20 2024-25 rank: NR Age: 23 2024-25 rank: NR Age: 23 2024-25 rank: 84 Age: 31 2024-25 rank: 76 Age: 32 2024-25 rank: 36 Age: 30 2024-25 rank: NR Age: 22 2024-25 rank: NR Age: 27 2024-25 rank: 47 Age: 26 2024-25 rank: 93 Age: 27 2024-25 rank: HM Age: 21 2024-25 rank: NR Age: 22 2024-25 rank: 78 Age: 33 2024-25 rank: NR Age: 30 Honorable mentions Note: Players are listed in alphabetical order.

2b6945ca719c,NCAAF,,"Week 7 shook up the College Football Playoff picture. No team earned a more impactful result than Indiana, whose win at Oregon is now the best in the country during the first half of the season. Indiana's playoff chances jumped 21%, climbing to a 93% chance to make the playoff, according to the Allstate Playoff Predictor . Not only are the Hoosiers off the bubble, but Indiana also is chasing a first-round bye as one of the top four seeds, having cemented its place alongside Ohio State and Miami as one of the nation's best teams. Indiana wasn't the only winner, though, as South Florida and Texas Tech both saw their playoff chances jump by at least 15%. Below you'll find one team in the spotlight for each of the Power 4 leagues and another identified as an enigma. We've also tiered schools into three groups. Teams with Would be in status are featured in this week's top 12 projection , a snapshot of what the selection committee's ranking would look like if it were released today. Teams listed as On the cusp are the true bubble teams and the first ones outside the bracket. A team with Work to do is passing the eye test (for the most part) and has a chance at winning its conference, which means a guaranteed spot in the playoff. And a team that Would be out is playing in the shadows of the playoff -- for now. The 13-member selection committee doesn't always agree with the Allstate Playoff Predictor, so the following categories are based on historical knowledge of the group's tendencies plus what each team has done to date. Reminder: This will change from week to week as each team builds -- or busts -- its résumé. Jump to a conference: ACC | Big 12 | Big Ten SEC | Independent | Group of 5 Bracket SEC Jacob Kupferman/Getty Images Spotlight: Tennessee . The Vols have looked like a borderline playoff team against unranked opponents in recent weeks, beating Mississippi State and Arkansas by a combined 10 points with one overtime. Offensively they've been elite, averaging 300 yards passing and 200 rushing per game. Defensively, they need to stop the run to make to challenge in the SEC. They'll have a chance against Alabama on Saturday to further legitimize their hopes. With a win, Tennessee's chances of reaching the playoff would jump to 52%, according to the Allstate Playoff Predictor. Tennessee ranks No. 10 in ESPN's game control metric and No. 19 in strength of record. The Vols are projected in the committee's No. 12 spot this week, which means they would get knocked out of the actual field during the seeding process to make room for the highest-ranked Group of 5 champion. The five highest-ranked conference champions are guaranteed spots in the playoff, so if the fifth team is ranked outside of the committee's top 12, its No. 12 team gets the boot. Enigma: Texas . The Longhorns took a baby step toward a return to CFP relevance with a big win against Oklahoma, but it was their first win against a Power 4 opponent and their first against a ranked team. Texas has the 15th-most-difficult remaining schedule, and with two losses is already in a precarious position. The Longhorns will play three of their next four opponents on the road (at Kentucky, Mississippi State and Georgia). There were encouraging signs from the win against the rival Sooners, from the stingy defense that flustered quarterback John Mateer all game to what looked like an improved offensive line that gave quarterback Arch Manning some time to throw. He completed 16 of 17 passes for 119 yards and a touchdown when under no duress. If Texas can continue to put it all together against the heart of its SEC schedule, it could make a run to be one of the committee's top two-loss teams. If the playoff were today Would be in: Alabama, Georgia, LSU, Oklahoma, Ole Miss, Texas A&M On the cusp: Tennessee Work to do: Missouri, Texas, Vanderbilt Would be out: Arkansas, Auburn, Florida, Kentucky, Mississippi State, South Carolina Big Ten Spotlight: USC . The Trojans have looked like a CFP top 25 team through the first half of the season, with their only loss a close one on the road to a ranked Illinois team. In Week 7, USC's convincing 31-13 win against Michigan pushed it into more serious Big Ten contention. Ohio State and Indiana are the leaders, followed by Oregon, but USC has the fourth-best chance (7.1%) to reach the Big Ten title game, according to ESPN Analytics. That will change when the Trojans go to Oregon on Nov. 22, but they don't play Ohio State or Indiana during the regular season. A win at Notre Dame on Saturday would be a significant boost to USC's playoff résumé, while simultaneously knocking the Irish out of playoff contention. According to the Allstate Playoff Predictor, USC's chances of reaching the playoff would adjust to 58% with a win against Notre Dame. According to ESPN Analytics, USC has less than a 50% chance to win its games against Notre Dame and Oregon. Enigma: Washington . The Huskies have improved significantly and quickly under coach Jedd Fisch, who's in his second season. Their only loss was to Ohio State, 24-6, on Sept. 27, but they lack a statement win that gives them real postseason credibility. Wins at Washington State and Maryland are certainly respectable, but bigger opportunities loom starting on Saturday at Michigan. This game has significant implications, because if the Huskies can win, they stand a strong chance of hosting Oregon as a one-loss team in the regular-season finale. According to ESPN Analytics, Michigan has a 67.6% chance to win on Saturday, and Oregon has a 70% chance to beat Washington on Nov. 29. The Huskies are projected to win every other game, though. A win against Michigan could increase their playoff hopes significantly. If the playoff were today Would be in: Indiana, Ohio State, Oregon On the cusp: USC Work to do: Nebraska, Washington Would be out: Iowa, Illinois, Maryland, Michigan, Michigan State, Minnesota, Northwestern, Penn State, Purdue, Rutgers, UCLA, Wisconsin ACC Spotlight: Georgia Tech . Raise your hand if you had Georgia Tech at Duke on Saturday circled as a game that would impact the College Football Playoff. The Yellow Jackets would have been the next team to crack the latest CFP projection this week, and their chances of reaching the ACC championship game will skyrocket if they can win at Duke. Georgia Tech currently has the fourth-best chance to reach the ACC title game behind Miami, Duke and Virginia. ESPN Analytics gives the Blue Devils a 61.8% chance to win. The only other projected loss on the Jackets' schedule is the regular-season finale against Georgia. Even if Georgia Tech reaches the ACC title game and loses, it could get in as a second ACC team with a win over Georgia. Enigma: Virginia . The Hoos have won back-to-back overtime games against Florida State and Louisville, putting themselves in contention for a spot in the ACC championship. They host a tricky Washington State team on Saturday that just gave Ole Miss a few headaches, though, and need to avoid a second loss to an unranked team. The toughest game left on their schedule is Nov. 15 at Duke. Without an ACC title, Virginia is going to have a tough time impressing the committee with a schedule that includes a loss to unranked NC State and possibly no wins against ranked opponents. It didn't help the Hoos that Florida State lost to an unranked Pitt, as the win against the Noles was the highlight of their season so far. If the playoff were today Would be in: Miami On the cusp: Georgia Tech Work to do: Virginia Would be out: Boston College, Cal, Clemson, Duke, Florida State, Louisville, North Carolina, NC State, Pitt, SMU, Stanford, Syracuse, Virginia Tech, Wake Forest Big 12 Spotlight: BYU . The Cougars needed a late-night double-overtime win at Arizona to stay undefeated and are on the path to face Texas Tech in the Big 12 championship game. The question is if they can stay undefeated until the Nov. 8 regular-season matchup against the Red Raiders. BYU has its second-most difficult remaining game on Saturday against rival Utah, which is also in contention for the Big 12 title. BYU has a slim edge with a 51% chance to win, which would be a critical cushion considering back-to-back road trips to Iowa State and Texas Tech await. The Big 12 has also gotten a boost from Cincinnati, which has a favorable remaining schedule and could be a surprise CFP top 25 team. If BYU stumbles over the next three weeks, a road win at a ranked Cincinnati team would help its résumé. Speaking of the Bearcats ... All of ESPN. All in one place. Watch your favorite events in the newly enhanced ESPN App. Learn more about what plan is right for you. Sign Up Now Enigma: Cincinnati . Is this team for real? The Bearcats have won five straight since their 20-17 season-opening loss to Nebraska, including three straight against Big 12 opponents Kansas, Iowa State and UCF. All three of those teams are .500 or better, and the selection committee will respect that as long as it holds. Cincinnati also has November opportunities against Utah and BYU, which could change the playoff picture in the Big 12. ESPN Analytics gives the Bearcats less than a 50% chance to beat Utah, BYU and TCU. If the playoff were today Would be in: Texas Tech On the cusp: BYU Work to do: Cincinnati, Houston, Utah Would be out: Arizona, Arizona State, Baylor, Colorado, Iowa State, Kansas, Kansas State, Oklahoma State, TCU, UCF, West Virginia Independent Would be out: Notre Dame. The Fighting Irish have the best chance to win out of any team in the FBS, with a 49% chance to finish 10-2. According to the Allstate Playoff Predictor, Notre Dame would have a 50% chance to reach the CFP if it runs the table. That seems accurate, given the selection committee would compare Notre Dame against the other 10-2 contenders, and it's a coin toss as to whether the room would agree that the Irish's résumé and film make them worthy of an at-large bid. How Miami and Texas A&M fare will impact this -- as will the head-to-head results if those teams don't win their respective leagues and are also competing with the Irish for one of those at-large spots. It helps Notre Dame that opponents USC and Navy could finish as CFP top 25 teams if they continue to win. Undefeated Navy could also make a run at the Group of 5 playoff spot. Group of 5 Spotlight: South Florida . South Florida. The Bulls are back on top after their convincing 63-36 win at previously undefeated North Texas, which just a week ago was listed here as a potential Group of 5 contender. Following the win, the Bulls' chances of reaching the CFP increased by 20%, according to ESPN Analytics. South Florida's lone loss was Sept. 13 at Miami, 49-12, which was a significant defeat against what could be the committee's No. 1 team. Although that result showed the gap between the Bulls and one of the nation's top teams, it certainly didn't eliminate South Florida, which has one of the best overall résumés of the other contenders. With wins against Boise State, Florida and now at North Texas, this is a team that earned the edge in this week's latest projection . Still, South Florida has the second-best chance of any Group of 5 school to reach the playoff (30%) behind Memphis (42%), according to ESPN Analytics. Enigma: UNLV . Undefeated UNLV survived a scare from 1-5 Air Force on Saturday to stay undefeated and in contention for a playoff spot. UNLV and Boise State, both of the Mountain West Conference, are the only teams outside of the American Conference with at least a 5% chance to reach the playoff, and they play each other in a critical game on Saturday. UNLV has scored at least 30 points in each of its six games this season and is 6-0 for the first time since 1974, but it hasn't always been pretty. UNLV scored the winning touchdown against Air Force with 36 seconds left and allowed the Falcons 603 total yards. The Rebels have the fourth-best chance to reach the playoff at 9% behind the American's Memphis, South Florida and Tulane. If the playoff were today Would be in: South Florida Work to do: Memphis, Navy, Tulane, UNLV Bracket Based on our weekly projection , the seeding would be: First-round byes No. 1 Ohio State (Big Ten champ) No. 2 Miami (ACC champ) No. 3 Indiana No. 4 Texas A&M (SEC champ) First-round games On campus, Dec. 19 and 20 No. 12 South Florida (American champ) at No. 5 Alabama No. 11 LSU at No. 6 Ole Miss No. 10 Oklahoma at No. 7 Georgia No. 9 Texas Tech (Big 12 champ) at No. 8 Oregon Quarterfinal games At the Goodyear Cotton Bowl, Capital One Orange Bowl, Rose Bowl Presented by Prudential and Allstate Sugar Bowl on Dec. 31 and Jan. 1.

8c06a359b95e,NBA,,"How will the NBA season look if my stats-based projections are an accurate measure of team ability? The purpose of simulating the NBA season ahead of time is generally to see how often various things are likely to happen, from the weakest teams winning the draft lottery to the best ones taking home the Larry O'Brien Trophy. It can also be fun to go through individual runs of the simulation to give an idea of what unlikely events could become reality based on random chance. In the spirit of ESPN's NFL tradition of detailing the events of a single simulation , let's go through the NBA season using simulation No. 620 -- chosen because of its interesting outcomes -- from opening night to the end of the NBA Finals. Note, this is not my prediction (or ESPN's) of how this season will unfold. The outcomes are produced at random via simulation, and everything else, including player stats, takes creative license. Along the way, we'll crown an NBA Cup winner, enjoy the action on Christmas Day, determine the final playoff seeds, set the draft lottery and winner, run through the play-in tournament, playoffs and finally, name the 2025-26 NBA champion. Let's get to it. Oct. 21: Thunder, Warriors dominate Opening Night Oklahoma City Thunder over Houston Rockets Golden State Warriors over Los Angeles Lakers After getting their championship rings and raising the first banner in the rafters at Paycom Arena, the Thunder showed why they were favored to repeat with an impressive win during Kevin Durant 's Houston debut. Durant scored 27 points against his former team, the first day of the regular season, but Shai Gilgeous-Alexander and Jalen Williams both topped 20 points and Chet Holmgren had five blocks. Later, the Warriors spoiled Luka Doncic 's first home opener with the Lakers, handing them a 107-99 defeat. Afterward, an ebullient Draymond Green vowed that the Warriors, not Oklahoma City, should be considered the title favorites. Illustration by ESPN Dec. 16: NBA Cup final features unexpected matchup Quarterfinals: (1) Boston Celtics over (4) Detroit Pistons (2) Miami Heat over (3) Cleveland Cavaliers (4) Minnesota Timberwolves over (1) Oklahoma City Thunder (3) Portland Trail Blazers over (2) Memphis Grizzlies Semifinals: (1) Boston Celtics over (2) Miami Heat (3) Portland Trail Blazers over (4) Minnesota Timberwolves NBA Cup final (Dec. 16): (1) Boston Celtics over (3) Portland Trail Blazers The NBA Cup, running from Oct. 21 to Dec. 16, resulted in an unexpected final in Las Vegas that pitted the Celtics against former guard Jrue Holiday and the Trail Blazers. Boston, off to a 16-10 start without the injured Jayson Tatum , finished as the No. 1 seed in the East play-in and beat the Pistons at home and the Heat in the semifinals in Las Vegas. The upstart Blazers, also 16-10, took advantage of the Thunder getting upset by the Timberwolves at home during the quarterfinals. Portland also won on the road, in Memphis, and then beat Minnesota in the semifinals. Alas, the Blazers' run ended in a 115-103 loss. Portland shot 10-of-36 on 3s, while Derrick White and Payton Pritchard made four apiece for Boston, which immediately shut down talk of referring to the NBA Cup as ""Banner 19."" Still, the Celtics were able to match the rival Lakers' inaugural NBA Cup title. Dec. 25: Knicks, Lakers stumble on Christmas Struggling teams were the storyline on Christmas Day. The Cavaliers and Knicks , who entered the season as East favorites, were 11th and seventh, respectively, going into their matchup at Madison Square Garden. The Cavaliers, buried by early-season injuries to the backcourt, got some measure of satisfaction with a win over the Knicks. There was no such relief for the Lakers, who dropped five games below .500 after losing at home to Houston. The vibes were better for the top two teams in the West, the surprising Warriors and Thunder, who both won at home. So did the Denver Nuggets behind a 30-point triple-double from Nikola Jokic .

Green and Jimmy Butler III joined Steph Curry on the West roster thanks to Golden State's league-best 42-13 record at the break. In the rearview mirror of the experienced Warriors there was plenty of youth with the Thunder 4.5 games back in the West and the ascendant Magic atop the East with the NBA's second-best record. After their slow starts, the Knicks and Cavaliers had righted the ships, moving up to second and fourth in the conference, respectively. The Clippers were tied for fourth in the West, but their crosstown rivals continued to stumble. Now 12 games below .500, the Lakers were all but eliminated from the play-in race at six games back of the Sacramento Kings for 10th. LeBron James mused about taking March off to watch his son Bryce play in the NCAA tournament for the Arizona Wildcats. NBA Standings through All-Star Break Eastern Conf. W L Win% Western Conf.

With less than two weeks left in the regular season, plenty remained at stake, including the top seed in the West. The Thunder had closed within 2.5 games of the still-hot Warriors. The race to avoid the play-in was hard-fought with three teams at 40 wins apiece, albeit with the Blazers two games back in the loss column of Houston and Minnesota. Two games back in the loss column for the play-in, the Mavericks were still looking to make it with Kyrie Irving 's return to the lineup. In the East, the Celtics -- who had gone just 19-30 since winning the NBA Cup -- were trying to hold off the Philadelphia 76ers and disappointing Detroit Pistons to reach the play-in.

In the East, the Magic ran away with the top seed and finished seven games clear of the Knicks. The No. 6 seed in both conferences was decided via a tiebreaker. Cleveland, which fell back off the pace after the All-Star break, ended up in the play-in with the Milwaukee Bucks getting the No. 6 seed. Meanwhile, Houston won a tie out West, sending the Timberwolves to the play-in a year after they narrowly avoided it.

Not only did Chicago win in Miami to claim the No. 8 seed in the East playoffs, but the Bulls also landed a first-round pick when Portland capped its unexpected season by winning at the Target Center to earn the seventh spot in the West. Things went from bad to worse for the Timberwolves in the final game of the play-in tournament as the Sacramento Kings handed them a surprise 103-101 loss on a DeMar DeRozan pull-up jumper in the final five seconds. Sacramento players celebrated by donning ""Kings of the Play-in"" T-shirts, much to the Bulls' dismay. There was less drama in Cleveland, where the Cavaliers salvaged the No. 7 seed with a 31-point win over Miami reminiscent of last year's dominant first-round sweep. Draft lottery 1.

Miami Heat For the second consecutive year, a team eliminated on the eve of the playoffs won the NBA draft lottery. This time, the Timberwolves didn't get to enjoy it like the Mavericks did in 2025. A swap from the Rudy Gobert trade sent the top pick to the Utah Jazz, who unsuccessfully attempted to deny their interest in drafting AJ Dybantsa from nearby BYU. The news wasn't all bad for Minnesota, which swapped down only to No. 5. Meanwhile, the 34-48 Pelicans didn't benefit from jumping up to No. 2, sending that pick to the Hawks to complete their deal on 2025 draft night. The Nets and Wizards claimed the next two picks, having entered with the best odds because of their combined 25 wins. Later on, the playoff-bound Thunder and Grizzlies acquired lottery picks through trades; the Grizzlies had the opportunity to swap for the Suns' pick in the Desmond Bane trade. Speaking to reporters before Game 1 of the NBA Finals, commissioner Adam Silver acknowledged that the league's competition committee will revisit lottery odds to avoid teams preferring the lottery to advancing through the play-in tournament.

Banged up from a difficult regular season and play-in appearance, Cleveland was eliminated at home in Game 6. But there was plenty of drama elsewhere. Two road teams with less experience won their Game 7s. The Toronto Raptors held former star Pascal Siakam to 15 points on 4-of-16 shooting for their first series win since 2020, and the Rockets shocked the Nuggets in Denver thanks to 12 fourth-quarter points from Durant. Houston hadn't advanced in the playoffs since 2019. The Clippers were the other lower seed to advance, beating Memphis, which ESPN BET listed as the underdog before the series.

Meanwhile, in a battle of the NBA's last dynasty against a team aspiring to become one, the Warriors lived up to Green's seasonlong hype. The teams split the first two games of the series before Golden State won the pivotal Game 5 and then closed out Oklahoma City on the road to host the NBA Finals. And the NBA champion is... In simulation No. 620, the Orlando Magic win the NBA title. John Raoux/AP Photo (1) Orlando Magic over (1) Golden State Warriors , 4-3 The Warriors' magical run to their seventh Finals in the past 12 years finally ran out of gas at home in Game 7, similar to Golden State's loss to Cleveland in 2016. With Curry playing through a minor injury by the end of the season, the Warriors' potent offense operated at less than full strength. Orlando took advantage, unexpectedly winning the first championship in franchise history barely a year after upgrading their starting lineup with Bane. Paolo Banchero completed a breakthrough campaign by scoring 32 points in Game 7 and being named Finals MVP. He split votes with Franz Wagner , who averaged 22 points, 8 rebounds and 5 assists in the series while defending Butler.

75d6e41aa04d,NBA,,"Oct 14, 2025, 07:00 AM ET We're a week away from opening tipoff for the 2025-26 NBA season with a few familiar faces and some new ones ready to take the court starting Oct. 21. Victor Wembanyama will be back and healthy to start the season after being shut down last February because of a blood clot in his right shoulder. And Zion Williamson will be back after playing in only 30 games last season for the New Orleans Pelicans because of various injuries. But you'll have to wait to see a few notable superstars debut this season. Los Angeles Lakers front man LeBron James is expected to sit out three to four weeks, according to ESPN's Shams Charania. Plus, Kyrie Irving appears to be working his way back from his season-ending ACL tear last March. Before we get caught up in the whirlwind of the regular season, our NBA insiders provide updates on the injury status of key players and break down who is primed to make a notable return during opening week and who to keep an eye on as the regular season progresses. Zion Williamson, center, has sat out more games (268) than he has played (214) since turning pro in 2019. ESPN Ready for their return Zion Williamson , F, New Orleans Pelicans There was skinny Jokic. Then skinny Doncic dazzled on the cover of Men's Health. Now it's skinny Zion who has many buzzing about the Pelicans this season, as he appears to be in his best shape since looking like a once-in-a-generation prospect at Duke. Williamson credits Daniel Bove, the Pelicans' director of performance and sports science, for helping him transform his body through boxing and working out on a football field while rehabbing from a hamstring injury that plagued him all last season. In six seasons in the league, Williamson has played 60 or more games only twice and was shut down last season in March after dealing with a bone bruise , having played only 30 games. ""I really felt a shift in my body to where I would look at [Bove] and say, 'Dude, it feels good to feel good.' I haven't felt like this since college, high school, where I can walk into a gym, I feel good."" -- Ohm Youngmisuk Anthony Davis , F, Dallas Mavericks Davis was fully cleared weeks before training camp, having recovered from offseason surgery to repair a detached retina in his right eye . He will spend the preseason getting used to the protective glasses he'll have to wear the rest of his career, per doctor's orders, as well as shedding the 15 extra pounds he carried into training camp. The 6-foot-10 Davis, now listed at 268 pounds, downplayed any worries about his weight, saying it's normal for him to report to camp a little heavy. ""I never want to come in at my playing weight, because then I lose weight during the season and then I'm too small,"" Davis said. ""I lose about 10 to 12 pounds very quickly. ... So I'm never concerned about that. I feel great. I'm moving great. I feel good."" -- Tim MacMahon Anthony Davis was traded from the Los Angeles Lakers to the Dallas Mavericks at last season's trade deadline. In the nine games he played for the Mavericks, he averaged 20 points and 4.4 assists. (Photo by Stacy Revere/Getty Images) Kristaps Porzingis , C, Atlanta Hawks Porzingis has a new home in Atlanta and the center, after dealing with a mysterious ailment that allowed him to play over 20 minutes in only one of his final six games with the Boston Celtics , says he's feeling good again. ""Honestly, I still don't have an exact answer,"" Porzingis said at Hawks media day when asked about what was bothering him. ""They had some sort of explanation for it, but it was lingering. That was the toughest part. Some days I was OK, energy was good and some days, boom, I had a crash. I'm glad it's gone now."" Porzingis played for the Latvia national team at EuroBasket this past summer and the center said the tournament helped him get back into shape for the upcoming season. The Hawks will need a healthy Porzingis to stretch the floor and provide a defensive presence at the rim for Trae Young and the Hawks to contend in the East. ""I don't know, maybe it was just my system needed some reset during the summer,"" Porzingis said. ""I was really happy I had this summer, got in shape, played the tournament, I felt confident again like I have the gas tank again."" -- Youngmisuk LaMelo Ball , G, Charlotte Hornets Ball spent time in the weight room this offseason to get stronger. After playing in a total of 105 games over the past three seasons combined because of injuries -- most recently being shut down last season to have surgery on his ankle and wrist -- Ball is determined to stay on the court. So far this preseason, coach Charles Lee and Ball have talked about the star point guard stepping up and leading the Hornets more this season. Lee said he has seen his point guard show some of his leadership in the weight room by adding muscle.

""Melo noticed that he is always drawing the best, most physical defender. At times, they made it difficult on him. ""So this year, adding that weight room piece for him was really important. ... I think he has increased his lean muscle mass, he has increased his weight."" -- Youngmisuk Victor Wembanyama , C, San Antonio Spurs Wembanyama was limited to 46 games last season because of right shoulder deep vein thrombosis. It motivated him to push himself physically and mentally this offseason in ways he has never experienced. He approached the offseason looking to try unconventional training methods , such as a 10-day retreat at a Shaolin temple in China, replete with meditation and kung fu training, and spent time working with Houston Rockets icon Hakeem Olajuwon . Early returns look promising. He has bullied defenders in the preseason and swatted shots from all over the court. Wembanyama is fully healthy and has improved his body control, adding upper- and lower-body strength. And according to the 21-year-old, the chances for a recurrence of DVT are very low. -- Michael C. Wright Tyrese Maxey , G, Philadelphia 76ers After sitting out the final few weeks of last season because of a finger injury -- one of many maladies during a season that, even by 76ers standards, felt particularly cursed -- Maxey is healthy and ready to go for the start of this season. He played in the two exhibition games in Abu Dhabi last week and is on track to begin the season as the starting point guard. Given the number of other injuries Philadelphia is already dealing with, the fact that Maxey is ready to go will be music to the ears of coach Nick Nurse. -- Tim Bontemps Ja Morant , G, Memphis Grizzlies Morant's goal to ""play 82,"" as he stated at media day, is already in jeopardy. He's considered week-to-week after spraining his left ankle during practice the day before the Grizzlies' preseason opener. Morant's acrobatic game makes durability an issue for the star guard. That's why Morant, whose popularity is fueled by his high-flying highlights, declared last season that he is ""not trying to dunk at all,"" prioritizing protecting himself over entertaining fans. Since serving a 25-game suspension to start the 2023-24 season, Morant has played in only 59 games. He has been sidelined during that stretch by a variety of injuries -- shoulder, hip, thigh, knee, back, foot, hamstring and ankle. -- MacMahon Opening night in question Jaren Jackson Jr ., F, Memphis Grizzlies Jackson's availability for the Oct. 22 season opener is in doubt as he works his way back from an early July surgery to repair a turf toe injury in his right foot. The Grizzlies announced entering training camp that Jackson would be able to return to play in four to six weeks, putting the two-time All-Star's timetable in late October or early November. The surgery occurred a couple of days after Jackson officially agreed to a five-year, $240 million contract extension, but the Grizzlies' front office was aware of the severity of the injury when that deal was finalized. -- MacMahon LeBron James , F, Los Angeles Lakers James will make history whenever he appears in his first game this season, becoming the only NBA player to have played 23 seasons. But for the first time in his career, James is injured before the season opener, ending his streak of playing in Game No. 1 for 22 straight years. James is dealing with sciatica down the right side of his body, according to the Lakers, and won't be reevaluated for another two to three weeks and has been limited to light shooting in training camp thus far, sitting out every practice and preseason game. James hinted at the injury -- which was sustained sometime in late July or early August during an on-court workout, sources told ESPN's Shams Charania -- during the team's media day when he told ESPN, ""I'm not where I want to be [physically].""  James also said he would be sure to stay connected to the team while he rehabilitated. ""My presence is going to be important,"" James told ESPN. ""Making sure that even if I'm not on the floor, I'm always in tune to what we're doing -- so I know what's going on at all times."" -- Dave McMenamin Zach Edey , C, Memphis Grizzlies Edey sit out at least the first two weeks of the season while recovering from offseason ankle surgery, according to the timetable the Grizzlies announced entering training camp. At the time, the team said that Edey could return to play in six to nine weeks. The longer end of that timetable would be the final weekend of November. Backup center Brandon Clarke also will sit out time to start the season while recovering from arthroscopic knee surgery, so the Grizzlies will have a glaring lack of depth in the frontcourt. Memphis will have to rely heavily on journeyman Jock Landale , an offseason addition who has averaged 12.8 minutes while playing for three teams in his four-year NBA career. -- MacMahon Jalen Williams , F, Oklahoma City Thunder Williams initially suffered a fairly severe wrist injury -- a torn scapholunate ligament -- late in the regular season while grappling for a loose ball with Devin Booker in Phoenix. He played through it, estimating he needed nearly 30 painkilling shots during the Thunder's run to the title. That delayed surgery until July 1, attached to a 12-week reevaluation clock, which expired right before training camp. The team hasn't officially ruled Williams in or out for the regular-season opener, but he hasn't been in the contact portions of practice and has been spotted working only individually on the side, predominantly using his left hand. ""Still got some ways to go with it,"" Williams said at media day. -- Anthony Slater play 1:30 Shams details what makes OKC special after Jalen Williams' extension Shams Charania explains the significance of the Thunder locking up their core after Jalen Williams' extension. Jared McCain , G, Philadelphia 76ers Last season, McCain was well on his way to winning the league's Rookie of the Year award when he suffered a meniscus injury that cut things short after only 23 games last December -- adding to the injury bug that plagued Philadelphia last season. But while McCain is fully healed from that injury, he tore a tendon in his right (shooting) thumb that required surgery last month, an issue that will cost him time at the start of the regular season. Though the 76ers have plenty of guard depth, they also want to get McCain on the court with both Tyrese Maxey and VJ Edgecombe , the No. 3 pick in the June draft. -- Bontemps De'Aaron Fox , G, San Antonio Spurs Last March, Fox opted to undergo season-ending surgery to repair tendon damage in his left pinkie finger and recovered just fine from that setback, only to suffer a strained right hamstring during a summer workout that leaves in question his availability for San Antonio's Oct. 22 season opener at Dallas. Fox acknowledged he would sit out the preseason while expressing doubt he'd be ready to play in the opener. But internally, the team has been encouraged by Fox's progress. It's worth noting that San Antonio traditionally errs on the side of caution when bringing players back from injuries. It certainly helps that the roster features a glut of guards that includes last season's NBA Rookie of the Year Stephon Castle and No. 2 pick Dylan Harper . -- Wright Dejounte Murray , G, New Orleans Pelicans Murray has spent six days a week in the training room, rehabbing and working his way back from a ruptured right Achilles tendon suffered at the end of January, and could be back this January. The point guard is eager to return after his first season in New Orleans was limited to only 31 games, as he was also hampered by a broken hand. Murray averaged 17.5 points, 7.4 assists, 6.5 rebounds and 2.0 steals after coming in a trade from Atlanta. ""I've been having fun seeing the progression, knowing that day it all happened, I just couldn't walk and couldn't feel my calf. It was a challenge and I accepted it."" -- Youngmisuk Until further notice Joel Embiid , C, Philadelphia 76ers In a familiar feeling for the 76ers and their fans -- most unfortunately -- there is no bigger health question in the league than Embiid, and specifically his troublesome left knee. For more than a calendar year, it has been unclear when, or if, Embiid is going to be right again, and he reiterated that at media day last month. ""I've had so many injuries,"" Embiid said. ""The only thing I've always told myself is you can't give up."" Though both Embiid and the 76ers are not giving up on the superstar center returning to the dominant form that led to winning the league's MVP award for the 2023 season, it remains unclear when he will be back on the court, be it at the start of the season or sometime after that. -- Bontemps play 0:55 How much of Joel Embiid will we see this season? Shams Charania joins ""NBA Today"" to explain why there is no set timeline for Joel Embiid to return from injury. Darius Garland , G, Cleveland Cavaliers After his postseason was affected by a turf toe injury, Garland opted to have surgery in June, one that is likely to sideline him for the first few weeks of the regular season. Garland said at media day last week that his recovery is on schedule and that he's running and doing on-court work. He remains out of participating with the team in practices to start the preseason, and isn't expected to be ready to play in any exhibition games. But Cleveland has made it clear that it isn't going to rush Garland back -- given the Cavaliers are hoping to be playing into June, and need Garland at 100% to do that. -- Bontemps Paul George , F, Philadelphia 76ers George's status for the start of the season remains unclear after it was announced he'd undergone an arthroscopic surgery after suffering an injury in an offseason workout -- an ominous sign after only playing in half the games in his first season in 2024-25. George, who has done some on-court work, said, ""I do think I will be at a good place, hopefully earlier than later. Can't get any worse than last year. That was a rock-bottom type of season."" We'll see if last season was, in fact, as bad as it can get, but the 76ers will be hoping George can be back either by opening night or soon thereafter. -- Bontemps Kyrie Irving , G, Dallas Mavericks Coach Jason Kidd went out of his way to push back against the perception that Irving is ""ahead of schedule"" in his recovery from a torn ACL suffered in early March. But Irving's progress is evident, and he hasn't been shy about putting the proof on display with his post-practice work during media access periods. Irving isn't only taking spot-up jump shots. He's working on his legendary isolation game, making one- and two-dribble moves against the defense of a team staffer. He often takes turns with No. 1  pick Cooper Flagg during these sessions, helping teach the 18-year-old rookie some tricks of the trade. When will Irving join Flagg in game action? Irving, 33, doesn't want to set a specific target date, preferring to pour himself into the daily grind. The Mavs would be happy to have Irving back in the mix around the All-Star break, which would give him about two months to chip off rust and ramp up before the postseason. -- MacMahon play 0:53 Jason Kidd doesn't consider Kyrie 'ahead of schedule' Mavs coach Jason Kidd dismisses reports that Kyrie Irving is ahead of schedule in his recovery. Lauri Markkanen , F, Utah Jazz A variety of injuries, most notably a lower-back issue, limited Markkanen last season to a career-low 47 games. But he bounced back over the summer and looked healthy, leading Finland to the bronze medal game at EuroBasket with a 29-point performance that included 8 rebounds, 4 assists and 3 steals in an upset win over Nikola Jokic and Serbia. Markkanen sustained a left wrist bruise during the tournament, which forced him out of preseason games and has limited him for a good portion of the team's training camp. Markkanen said he's rehabbing daily, feeling better, and making progress, but added he's ""not sure of what the exact date is when I'm gonna start"" playing again. -- Wright",https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/46553585/biggest-injury-returns-2025-26-nba-season-wembanyama-zion-embiid,Sport,BBC,,https://a2.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2025%2F1013%2Fnba_biggest_injury_1296x729.png,,6b5ca69591b7936aa58ca774069e00758627c858
af39c21ed6e1,WNBA,,"When the Las Vegas Aces won their third WNBA title in four seasons, the debate Friday immediately turned to whether they had cemented their status as the league's next dynasty. Now it's time to see where this Aces' title team ranks among the league's 29 champions. It's not easy an easy task. There was a big gap this season between the 2025 Aces at their worst versus at their best. Perhaps no other team in league history reversed its fortunes so dramatically, going from 14-14 after a 53-point loss on Aug. 2 to completing a 4-0 sweep of the WNBA Finals on Oct. 10. The Aces ended the regular season on a 16-game winning streak, but their playoff run had its drama. They were nearly upset in the first round, winning the deciding Game 3 by one point against Seattle. They went to overtime in the deciding Game 5 of the semifinals against Indiana. And Games 1 and 3 of the Finals versus Phoenix were decided by a combined five points. All of that is why the 2025 Aces aren't in the top 10 like their 2022 and 2023 championship predecessors. Speaking of which: Among the biggest challenges for assembling this list is ranking champions who are from the same franchise and were made up of mostly the same players. We've attempted to split those hairs. There is more than one way to assess the teams. ESPN's Michael Voepel ranked the teams based on discussions with coaches and players around the league, plus some old-fashioned subjectivity. ESPN's Kevin Pelton ranked the champions 1 through 29 using a similar statistical model to the one he developed to determine the NBA's top teams. Based on the predictive power of point differential, it starts with that mark in the regular season. Ultimately, being at the bottom in these rankings isn't that much different from being at the top. They're all champions. Regular season and playoff records: 34-6, 8-1 Defeated the New York Liberty 3-1 in Finals Pelton overall rank: 2 RS differential: +12.6 (3rd among champions) PO rating: +20.3 (2nd among champions) Rating: +13.7 (first among champions) As good as they were in winning the 2022 championship, the Aces were even better in 2023. They ranked No. 1 in scoring and defense during the regular season and stumbled just once in the playoffs, in Game 3 of the Finals. A'ja Wilson got her first WNBA Finals MVP honor for her performance in 2023; she won again for the 2025 Finals. In Chelsea Gray , Kelsey Plum and Jackie Young , the Aces also had trio of guards who were among the best backcourts in league history . Candace Parker, a free-agent signee who was expected to be a big part of the Aces' 2023 title run, was sidelined by foot surgery that July. The Aces also lost starters Gray and Kiah Stokes before Game 4 and still won the title, illustrating how good the chemistry was for the team. The Las Vegas bench -- then led by Alysha Clark , Cayla George, Sydney Colson and Kierstan Bell -- came through when they were needed most. -- Voepel play 1:42 How the Aces' resiliency led them to back-to-back championships Rebecca Lobo examines how the Aces won the battle of the superteams vs. the Liberty and became back-to-back champions. 2. 2000 Houston Comets Regular season and playoff records: 27-5, 6-0 Defeated the New York Liberty 2-0 in Finals This was the last of Houston's four consecutive title teams, the end of the Comets' version of ""Camelot."" In 2000, the WNBA was at 16 teams and most of the former ABL players were in their second year in the league. Sheryl Swoopes won her first of three MVP awards and two-time MVP Cynthia Cooper played her last full season at age 37. As was the case with the other Houston championship teams, the stars carried them: Swoopes and Cooper averaged 35 minutes a game, Tina Thompson 34 and Janeth Arcain 30.5. Fifth starter, Tiffani Johnson (22.2), was the only other player who averaged at least 20 minutes a game. With three future Hall of Famers (Cooper, Swoopes, Thompson), Houston didn't need much statistically from its reserves. The Comets' bench players knew their roles, and the team knew how to win. This title ended the dynasty -- the Los Angeles Sparks were ascending -- but what a finish. -- Voepel The Comets weren't the top seed in the playoffs. Despite the best differential in league history, Houston finished one game back of the 28-4 Sparks before sweeping Los Angeles in the best-of-three conference finals. Five of the Comets' six playoff wins came by eight points or fewer, but all three of their opponents went 20-12 or better during a top-heavy year where the league expanded by four teams. -- Pelton Sheryl Swoopes, left, was the 2000 WNBA MVP, and Cynthia Cooper, right, won her fourth straight WNBA Finals MVP award as the Comets won the last of their four titles. Bill Baptist/NBAE via Getty Images Regular season and playoff records: 18-4, 6-0 Defeated the Las Vegas Aces 3-0 in Finals Bringing back the same core that won the 2018 title into a bubble season marked by opt-outs of several stars, the Storm entered 2020 as heavy favorites. Seattle wasn't the No. 1 seed in the playoffs, losing a tiebreaker to Las Vegas, but dominated with veteran point guard Sue Bird back in the lineup. After a COVID-19 scare postponed their opening semifinals game, the Storm never looked back, going 6-0 in the playoffs with five of the six wins by double-digits -- including a 33-point blowout to close out the Aces. -- Pelton Bird, part of all four Storm title teams, has ruminated over which of them was ""best."" Lauren Jackson was the superstar of the 2004 and 2010 Storm title teams; her counterpart in 2018 and 2020 was Breanna Stewart . Bird said an edge goes to the very similarly constructed 2018 and 2020 teams due to the presence of guard Jewell Loyd . Bird then gives a nod to the overall depth and chemistry to the 2020 Storm, who were first in the league in offensive and defensive rating. ""The way we shot 3's, the way we moved the ball -- if you took something away, we'd just keep it moving,"" Bird said. ""We talked before every game that we were going to wear teams out with the pace that we played."" -- Voepel The Seattle Storm's 2020 championship team had incredible overall depth and chemistry, and led the WNBA in offensive and defensive rating. Julio Aguilar/Getty Images Regular season and playoff records: 26-8, 7-0 Defeated the Atlanta Dream 3-0 in Finals This was the second of four Lynx titles in a seven-season span. They didn't have the best regular-season record among Lynx champs; both 2011 and 2017 went 27-7 (and the 2016 runners-up were 28-6). But coach Cheryl Reeve said the ""core four"" of the franchise -- Seimone Augustus, Rebekkah Brunson, Maya Moore and Lindsay Whalen -- were near the peak of their collective powers in 2013. They all averaged double figures in scoring, led by Moore's 18.5 PPG. The fifth starter was Janel McCarville, Whalen's former University of Minnesota teammate, and that pairing again thrilled Gophers fans. In 2012, Minnesota lost 3-1 in the Finals to Indiana, which irked the Lynx because they were five games better than the Fever in the regular-season standings. The 2013 team didn't allow any openings in the playoffs, sweeping Seattle, Phoenix and Atlanta. -- Voepel This Lynx championship team was the league's best from start to finish, sweeping its way to a title with the best playoff point differential ever (+15.4 PPG). We were denied playoff matchups against either of the other two teams to win at least 20 games during the regular season because both Chicago and Los Angeles were upset earlier in the postseason. -- Pelton 5. 1998 Houston Comets Regular season and playoff records: 27-3, 4-1 Defeated the Phoenix Mercury 2-1 in Finals More on Pelton's ranking system The statistical model ESPN's Kevin Pelton developed starts with point differential in the regular season. Pelton then added playoff point differential and adjusted it for the regular-season performance of the opponents each team faced en route to the title to give more credit for beating another powerful opponent than a lesser competitor. There are two key differences from the rating Pelton used for the NBA and the WNBA version. First, instead of giving equal weight to play in the regular season and playoffs, he weighed each of them by games played to acknowledge the greater variability in the shorter WNBA postseason. (That gap has narrowed somewhat by the WNBA going to a best-of-seven format in the Finals this year.) Second, since the WNBA hasn't gone through as many different eras, he did not use an adjustment for quality of play in a given season. After winning the WNBA's inaugural championship with limited contributions from Swoopes, who played just nine games after giving birth to son, Jordan, and did not score in the 1997 playoffs, the Comets teamed a prime Swoopes with reigning MVP Cooper and second-year forward Thompson. The result was a 27-3 record, still the best winning percentage in league history. Houston's playoff rating isn't quite as relatively strong because the Comets were taken the distance in the best-of-three Finals by a 19-11 Phoenix Mercury team. -- Pelton Cooper said if she had to pick just one Comets championship team as her favorite, it would be this one. As Kevin noted, the team's .900 winning percentage remains the best in WNBA history. Swoopes was second on the team in scoring at 15.6 PPG to Cooper's 22.7. Cooper won her second consecutive MVP award; she was Finals MVP for all four championship teams. And there's another reason this team is dear to Cooper's heart. Her close friend, Kim Perrot, the Comets' spark plug point guard, averaged 8.5 points and 4.7 assists in what would be her last season in the WNBA. Perrot had 13 points, five rebounds and four assists in the title-clinching win over the Mercury. Five months later, she was diagnosed with cancer and died in August 1999 at age 32. -- Voepel Regular season and playoff records: 29-5, 7-1 Defeated the Chicago Sky 3-0 in Finals Amid the Lynx dynasty from 2011 to 2017, the Mercury owned this season. Their 29 wins is a WNBA record, and they were first in offensive and defensive rating. All five starters -- Diana Taurasi, Brittney Griner , Candice Dupree, Penny Taylor and DeWanna Bonner -- averaged double digits in scoring. Their only loss in the playoffs came to Minnesota in Game 2 of the Western Conference finals, but they bounced back to win the series with an 18-point Game 3 victory. In the WNBA Finals, Chicago was no match. Taurasi, who averaged 16.2 PPG in the regular season and 21.9 PPG in the playoffs, was WNBA Finals MVP for the second time. -- Voepel The 2014 Phoenix team still holds the best winning percentage for any team outside the expansion era. Relative to that record, the Mercury's +9.5 differential wasn't especially dominating, the reason Phoenix falls outside the top five in my rankings. In the playoffs, Phoenix was outstanding, beating the defending champion Lynx 2-1 in the conference finals and sweeping a 15-19 Chicago team in the Finals by an average of 18.3 PPG. -- Pelton 7. 2017 Minnesota Lynx Regular season and playoff records: 27-7, 6-2 Defeated the Los Angeles Sparks 3-2 in Finals The top-rated one of the Lynx's four title teams in my model fully integrated Sylvia Fowles, who won MVP and Finals MVP, to the core of the team that had already won three championships in the previous six years. After sweeping Washington in the semifinals, Minnesota rallied from a 2-1 deficit to win a Finals rematch against the Sparks in five games. -- Pelton Minnesota was still smarting over a 3-2 Finals loss to Los Angeles in 2016, and the teams were again archrivals in 2017. Minnesota was first in the league in offensive and defensive rating and Los Angeles was second in both. Target Center was being renovated, so the Lynx's home games in the 2017 playoffs were at the University of Minnesota' Williams Arena, where Whalen had played in college. The decisive 85-76 Game 5 win came in a packed and cacophonous Williams, and Fowles was Finals MVP for a second time (she also won in 2015). -- Voepel Maya Moore, Seimone Augustus, Lindsay Whalen and Rebekkah Brunson led Minnesota to the 2013 title. The Lynx core only got stronger when Sylvia Fowles joined the team two years later. Scott Cunningham/NBAE via Getty Images Regular season and playoff records: 26-8, 6-3 Defeated the Connecticut Sun 3-2 in Finals Compared to a regular season that saw the Mystics win a record 13 games by 20-plus points -- four more than any other team in league history -- their playoff run was a slog. Washington outscored Las Vegas by just one point in a hard-fought four-game semifinals win, then needed the full five games to beat Connecticut in a classic Finals. A formula that puts more emphasis on the playoffs would drop the Mystics in the statistical rankings. -- Pelton Elena Delle Donne said this was the best team she has ever played on: ""Not just talent-wise, but the way emotionally and mentally we were so on-point with one another. That's what took us to the next level."" The Mystics also overcame a back injury that hampered Delle Donne during the Finals and has impacted her career since. Delle Donne was the MVP in 2019, but teammate Emma Meesseman was the Finals MVP, averaging 17.8 points in the championship series. -- Voepel 9. 2022 Las Vegas Aces Regular season and playoff records: 26-10, 8-2 Defeated the Connecticut Sun 3-1 in Finals The 2022 Aces ran into more challenges in the regular season than the 2023 version of Las Vegas. But by the playoffs, they were in control as the league's best team. In coach Becky Hammon's first season with the franchise , the Aces changed their playing style -- 3-pointers became a far bigger part of the offense -- and Plum and Young matured into even better players. Wilson won her second regular-season MVP award and was Defensive Player of the Year. Then Gray was on fire throughout the playoffs, winning Finals MVP. It was a big achievement for a franchise that started when the league did in 1997, in Utah, moved to San Antonio, and then found its championship home in Las Vegas under owner Mark Davis. He paid top dollar to bring Hammon from the NBA, where she was a San Antonio Spurs assistant, and it was a great investment. -- Voepel 10. 1999 Houston Comets Regular season and playoff records: 26-6, 4-2 Defeated the New York Liberty 2-1 in Finals Only by contrast to Houston's championship teams before and after would the 26-6 Comets look unspectacular. Houston came within Teresa Weatherspoon's unforgettable buzzer-beating heave of sweeping the playoffs and came back to finish off New York in the winner-take-all Game 3 of the Finals to hoist the trophy a third time. -- Pelton In 1999, almost all the former ABL standouts had transitioned into and strengthened the WNBA. That didn't stop the Comets, who added former ABL player Sonja Henning at point guard. Houston's standouts were the same as in 1998: Cooper, Swoopes and Thompson. Bulgarian center Polina Tzekova, then 31, made the most of her only WNBA season, starting every game for Houston in 1999. Ultimately, there was a melancholy feel to the 1999 championship for the Comets. Their former point guard Perrot died from cancer on Aug. 19. On Sept. 5, Houston secured ""3 for 10"" -- its motto in winning its third title in honor of Perrot, who wore No. 10. -- Voepel Regular season and playoff records: 32-8, 8-3 Defeated the Minnesota Lynx 3-2 in Finals Pelton overall rank: 11 RS differential: +9.2 (10th among champions) PO rating: +9.4 (19th among champions) Rating: +9.2 (11th among champions) It took 27 years since the launch of the Liberty as an original WNBA franchise in 1997, but New York finally broke through for its first championship. After finishing with the best record in the league, the Liberty defeated defending champion Las Vegas in the semifinals and then avenged a Commissioner's Cup final loss to Minnesota in the Finals. The deciding Game 5 vs. the Lynx nearly extended the Liberty's long postseason heartbreak. But a late foul (still disputed by Minnesota) sent Breanna Stewart to the line. She scored the tying points to send the game into overtime, where New York prevailed 67-62. Jonquel Jones won the Finals MVP honor as she got her first title. Sabrina Ionescu also won the championship for the first time. It was the third title for Stewart, who won two championships in Seattle. -- Voepel The New York Liberty won their first WNBA title in 2024. Jonquel Jones was Finals MVP. Elsa/Getty Images Regular season and playoff records: 28-4, 6-1 Defeated the Charlotte Sting 2-0 in Finals After being denied by the Comets a year earlier, the Sparks became the first championship team besides Houston in the league's fifth season. Los Angeles matched the 28-4 record of the previous season with a slightly better point differential. The Sparks followed their lone playoff loss, by one point to the Sacramento Monarchs in the conference finals, with three wins by at least 20 points in their final four postseason games. -- Pelton The Sparks learned a lot going against Houston for four seasons before making their championship breakthrough. Los Angeles star Lisa Leslie has joked, ""Thank God that Coop retired,"" in reference to the Houston's Cooper ending her playing career after the 2000 season (she returned for four games in 2003 at age 40). Leslie, Mwadi Mabika, Tamecka Dixon and DeLisha Milton-Jones all averaged in double figures during this title run. Leslie was MVP for the season and the Finals. -- Voepel 13. 2011 Minnesota Lynx Regular season and playoff records: 27-7, 7-1 Defeated the Atlanta Dream 3-0 in Finals In 2010, Minnesota got a new coach (Reeve) and also added Whalen (trade) and Brunson (Sacramento dispersal draft). The next year brought the opening championship of the Lynx dynasty as No. 1 pick Moore was Rookie of the Year. The 22-year-old Moore started alongside Taj McWilliams-Franklin, who turned 41 two weeks after the Finals ended. This Lynx team really spanned the age/experience gamut. The season also brought a well-deserved spotlight to Augustus, who became the original building block for the dynasty when she was drafted No. 1 in 2006. She led the 2011 Lynx in scoring in the regular season (16.2) and playoffs (22.0) and was the Finals MVP. -- Voepel The first Lynx title winner announced itself as a contender by winning six more games than any other team during the regular season. Following a hard-fought 2-1 win in the opening round over the San Antonio Silver Stars, Minnesota swept the next two rounds en route to a championship. -- Pelton 14. 2016 Los Angeles Sparks Regular season and playoff records: 26-8, 6-3 Defeated the Minnesota Lynx 3-2 in Finals After winning back-to-back titles in 2001-02, the Sparks endured a lot of frustrating ""almost"" in the playoffs. They lost in the WNBA Finals in 2003 and the conference finals in 2006, 2008, 2009 and 2012. The playoff format changed in 2016, seeding the top eight teams regardless of conference, and the Sparks made the Finals again. In an epic five-game series, they beat Minnesota 77-76 on Nneka Ogwumike 's putback with 3.1 seconds remaining. Ogwumike was the season MVP and teammate Candace Parker the Finals MVP. It was the last jewel to complete Parker's crown; she already had won two NCAA titles and two Olympic gold medals. -- Voepel That timely rule change allowed the 26-8 Sparks and 28-6 Lynx -- the league's two best teams by a five-game margin -- to meet in the Finals, setting up perhaps the greatest series in league history. -- Pelton 15. 2025 Las Vegas Aces Regular season and playoff records: 30-14, 9-3 Defeated the Phoenix Mercury 4-0 in Finals Pelton overall rank: 13 RS differential: +2.9 (28th among champions) PO rating: +8.7 (22nd among champions) Rating: +4.0 (28th among champions) The 2025 Aces might be the most difficult champion to rank because the first half of their five-month season (counting playoffs) was so different from the second half. These Aces are next to last using Pelton's model, but some key factors elevate them to the middle of the pack in the overall rankings. The first is the play of Wilson , who won her fourth regular-season MVP and second Finals MVP. During the playoffs, she averaged 26.8 PPG, 10.0 RPG, 3.3 assists and 2.5 blocks. Her postseason performance was even greater than in the regular season. She also hit the most crucial shot of the Finals: the game winner with less than a second left in Game 3 to give the Aces a 90-88 victory. The Aces also got a terrific postseason from guards Jackie Young (20.4 PPG, 5.5 APG) and Chelsea Gray (11.2 PPG, 7.3 APG). The Aces' 17-game winning streak (counting Game 1 of the playoffs) is the second longest in WNBA history. And coach Becky Hammon led the Aces to a third championship in four years despite having to replace a key player (guard Kelsey Plum) from the first two title teams. The Aces are the league's ultimate example that it's not how you start, it's how you finish. -- Voepel play 1:54 Jackie Young: A'ja Wilson will be the GOAT when she retires Jackie Young joins ""SportsCenter"" to discuss the Aces' championship and A'ja Wilson's legacy. 16. 2018 Seattle Storm Regular season and playoff records: 26-8, 6-2 Defeated the Washington Mystics 3-0 in Finals History repeated itself with the Storm. They had back-to-back No. 1 picks in Jackson and Bird in 2001 and 2002, which led to two titles. Seattle again got consecutive No. 1s in 2015 and 2016 with Loyd and Stewart, which also led to two titles. This 2018 championship in a lot of ways was won in the semifinals, when the Storm held off Phoenix in an epic Game 5 in which Bird took over in the fourth quarter. In the finals, Seattle wasn't going to be denied and swept the Mystics. And the Storm looked to be a strong threat to become the first repeat champion since the Sparks in 2001-02. But an Achilles injury kept Stewart out in 2019. When she returned in 2020, the Storm picked up where they had left off in 2018. -- Voepel With Los Angeles and Minnesota both eliminated in advance of the semifinals after back-to-back Finals meetings, the Storm emerged as the league's best team, improving by 11 wins under first-year head coach Dan Hughes with Stewart winning MVP. -- Pelton 17. 2010 Seattle Storm Regular season and playoff records: 28-6, 7-0 Defeated the Atlanta Dream 3-0 in Finals All of ESPN.

Seattle went 28-6 in the regular season and became the first team to go 7-0 in the postseason after the Finals expanded to best-of-five series in 2005. The Storm specialized in close wins, going 9-1 in games decided by five points or fewer in the regular season and winning their last five playoff games by single digits. -- Pelton The 2010 Storm were six games better than any team in the WNBA; no other team in the Western Conference even had a winning record. Jackson won her third MVP award, and she and Bird got to celebrate their second WNBA championship together. Bird, Swin Cash and Svetlana Abrosimova, who had won an NCAA title together at UConn in 2000, all played for this Storm team. Seattle didn't lose at home in 2010, which ended up being Jackson's last full season in the WNBA, as injuries forced her out of the league after 2012. -- Voepel 18. 2005 Sacramento Monarchs Regular season and playoff records: 25-9, 7-1 Defeated the Connecticut Sun 3-1 in Finals After losing in the conference finals three of the previous four years, the Monarchs broke through in 2005, sweeping their way to the Finals and pulling off a mild upset of a 26-8 Connecticut team with home-court advantage in four games. -- Pelton At age 29, Yolanda Griffith entered the WNBA in 1999 from the ABL and was her new league's MVP that year, a perfect target for point guard Ticha Penicheiro. Griffith also won Finals MVP, and it was a career-best year for DeMya Walker, who led the Monarchs in scoring in the regular season and made an All-Star appearance. This was also the first of Rebekkah Brunson's five WNBA titles; her other four came with Minnesota. -- Voepel 19. 2002 Los Angeles Sparks Regular season and playoff records: 25-7, 6-0 Defeated the New York Liberty 2-0 in Finals Coming off back-to-back 28-4 records, the Sparks slipped by three games during a less dominant regular season. They were more impressive during the playoffs, going 7-0 with an average margin of 12.0 PPG. -- Pelton The Sparks' repeat championship seemed more predictable than extraordinary at the time, coming after Houston had won four in a row. But almost two decades later, no franchise has gone back-to-back, so Los Angeles' achievement stands out more now. There isn't much to separate this team from the 2001 Sparks, who had a little better regular-season record. The standout players were the same except for Nikki Teasley, a rookie in 2002 who hit the championship-clinching 3-pointer in Game 2 of the Finals. -- Voepel 20. 2006 Detroit Shock Regular season and playoff records: 23-11, 7-3 Defeated the Sacramento Monarchs 3-2 in Finals After a 23-11 regular season, the Shock upset a 25-9 Connecticut team with a 24-point road win in the deciding Game 3. Detroit got home-court advantage thanks to Sacramento upsetting Los Angeles in the Western Conference finals and used it, rallying from a 2-1 deficit to knock off the defending champs in five games. -- Pelton A big key for this team was the 2005 midseason trade that brought Katie Smith to the Shock. She fit in well with Cash, Cheryl Ford, Deanna Nolan and Ruth Riley, who were all on Detroit's 2003 championship squad. Nolan, a native of nearby Flint, Michigan, was Finals MVP as the Shock prevented Sacramento's attempt at a repeat. In the decisive Game 5, won 80-75 by Detroit, Nolan played all 40 minutes and scored 24 points. -- Voepel Regular season and playoff records: 22-12, 7-3 Defeated the Minnesota Lynx 3-1 in Finals A long-awaited title for Tamika Catchings came as something of a surprise after the Fever finished with the league's fourth-best record during the regular season. Indiana reached a different level in the playoffs, as Mechelle notes below. -- Pelton When Indiana lost its playoff opener 75-66 at home to Atlanta, there was no reason to think anything magical was in the works. Yet two days later, Indiana scored 103 points in beating the Dream, then closed out that series with another victory. The roller coaster wasn't over. The Fever also lost their opener in the East finals to Connecticut and were on the verge of getting swept before pulling Game 2 out of the fire and winning Game 3 on the road. Next up: A Lynx team that had the best record in the league that year. The Fever and Lynx split the first two games of the Finals, but Game 3 was one of the weirdest in WNBA playoff history. The Lynx, who led the league in offensive rating, were held to a season-low 59 points, while Indiana's Shavonte Zellous erupted for 30 points. Indiana had been up 2-1 in the 2009 Finals but couldn't close out that series at home and lost Game 5 at Phoenix. In 2012, franchise legend Catchings and the Fever won Game 4 at home. -- Voepel 22. 2007 Phoenix Mercury Regular season and playoff records: 23-11, 7-2 Defeated the Detroit Shock 3-2 in Finals Three years after winning her third title at UConn, Taurasi won her first WNBA championship. Phoenix's winning formula was coach Paul Westhead's run-and-gun offense, which was first in the league. Defense was not as much a priority; the Mercury were next-to-last in defensive rating. But it worked, with Taurasi, Taylor, Cappie Pondexter and Tangela Smith all averaging double digits in scoring. The Finals matchup with defending champion Detroit got chippy, with Phoenix surviving a physical Game 4 in a 77-76 win. Then the Mercury became the first WNBA team to win a championship on the road, taking Game 5 108-92 at Detroit behind 30 points from Taylor -- who went 18 of 18 from the free throw line -- and 26 points and 10 assists from Finals MVP Pondexter. -- Voepel Despite a 23-11 record, the Mercury had the worst point differential in the regular season of any champion to date. (Whoever wins this year's Finals will surpass them.) Phoenix was much more impressive in the playoffs, sweeping to the Finals and outscoring Detroit by a combined 30 points in a series that went the full five games. -- Pelton 23. 2004 Seattle Storm Regular season and playoff records: 20-14, 6-2 Defeated the Connecticut Sun 2-1 in Finals In a season without a dominant team, the 20-14 Storm had the league's best differential during the regular season, then got home-court advantage throughout the playoffs when the 25-9 Sparks -- who had gone 3-1 against Seattle that season -- were upset in the opening round. Seattle went the distance to beat both Sacramento and Connecticut. -- Pelton This was Seattle's first trip to the WNBA Finals. And this was the last year that the Finals was a best-of-three series. The Storm were on the ropes after a 68-64 opening loss at Connecticut. But they pulled out a 67-65 nail-biter in Game 2 at Seattle, led by Betty Lennox's 27 points. In Game 3, with KeyArena packed with Storm fans wielding thunder sticks, Lennox had 23 points and earned Finals MVP honors as Seattle clinched the title 74-60. -- Voepel 24. 2015 Minnesota Lynx Regular season and playoff records: 22-12, 7-3 Defeated the Indiana Fever 3-2 in Finals Of the Lynx's four title teams, this was the only one with double-digit losses, as Augustus and Whalen both dealt with injuries. But big-time help came via two trades in July: first for guard Renee Montgomery and then for center Fowles, who had sat out the season to that point to force a trade from Chicago. Moore, the 2014 MVP, was again brilliant in 2015, leading the Lynx in scoring in the regular season (20.6 PPG) and the postseason (23.4). She hit a buzzer-beating 3-pointer to win Game 3 of the Finals vs. Indiana 80-77. The Fever won Game 4, but Fowles cemented her Finals MVP award with 20 points and 11 rebounds in a Game 5 victory. -- Voepel It's surprising to see the Lynx in last in my statistical model given the championship teams two years before and after are both among my top seven, and the next year's runner-up is the best-rated non-champion in WNBA history. Minnesota was still integrating Fowles, acquired midseason, and slogged through the postseason. The Lynx's +2.5 differential in playoff games was lowest for any champion. Minnesota had just two playoff wins by more than seven points -- one of them in the deciding Game 5 of the Finals against Indiana. -- Pelton 25. 2009 Phoenix Mercury Regular season and playoff records: 23-11, 7-4 Defeated the Indiana Fever 3-2 in Finals Thus far, the 2009 Mercury are the only champion in league history to go the distance in every series they played, winning three deciding games. (Phoenix could do that one better this year, winning four deciding games with a potential five-game Finals win.) Naturally, Finals MVP Taurasi was at her best in those games, averaging 25.3 PPG in the elimination wins. -- Pelton This was a good team led by a great player in Taurasi, who won her only regular-season MVP award in 2009. Like the 2007 champions, the Mercury focused on outscoring foes: Phoenix was first in offensive rating and last in defensive rating. Five players averaged in double figures, led by Taurasi's 20.4 PPG and Pondexter's 19.1. The first game of the 2009 Finals was amazing: a 120-116 Mercury victory over Indiana. But the Fever took the next two games and had a chance to close out the series at home. Phoenix's defense showed up for Game 4, holding the Fever to a series-low 77 points. In Game 5, Taurasi and Pondexter combined for 50 points to win their last game as Phoenix teammates. Pondexter requested and got a trade to New York the next year. -- Voepel Regular season and playoff records: 16-16, 8-2 Defeated the Phoenix Mercury 3-1 in Finals With longtime Sparks star Candace Parker coming to her hometown of Chicago as a free agent, there were big expectations for the 2021 Sky. Chicago went .500 in the regular season, the worst record of any championship team. But all the pieces were there -- including point guard Courtney Vandersloot and guard/forward Kahleah Copper -- to win a title. The No. 6 seed, the Sky beat Dallas in the first round and Minnesota in the second. Then they went against No. 1 seed Connecticut in the semifinals. A double-overtime win in the first game of the series was pivotal, and Chicago won 3-1. In the Finals, the Sky won 3-1 over Phoenix, with Parker celebrating with family as the franchise won its first title. 27. 1997 Houston Comets Regular season and playoff records: 18-10, 2-0 Defeated the New York Liberty in championship game This is where it all started, with the Comets winning the inaugural championship of the WNBA, which launched with eight teams. Cooper at age 34 was the best player in the new league, averaging 22.2 points and being named MVP. They played just single-game semifinals and finals in the first year, and Cooper scored 31 and 25 points in those victories. Thompson, who had been the top pick in the college draft, averaged 13.2 points and Brazil's Arcain 10.9. Swoopes gave birth to a son on June 25, just after the WNBA season had started. She played her first game on Aug. 7, and appeared in nine regular-season and two playoff games. - Voepel Because Swoopes was a part-time player, the inaugural Comets weren't yet the juggernaut they'd soon become, going just 18-10 in the regular season. Houston was more dominant in the playoffs, winning the two one-and-done games by an average of 15 points. -- Pelton 28. 2008 Detroit Shock Regular season and playoff records: 22-12, 7-2 Defeated the San Antonio Silver Stars 3-0 in Finals As the top seed in the Eastern Conference, the Shock needed the full three games to beat both Indiana and New York before playing their best basketball in the Finals. Against a San Antonio team with home-court advantage, Detroit pulled off a surprising sweep by an average of 10.7 PPG. -- Pelton By the time the Stars met the Shock in the WNBA Finals, Detroit was the better team. Five Shock players averaged in double figures in the regular season, led by Nolan and Smith. A late-season trade brought McWilliams-Franklin to Detroit, and she averaged 12.9 points and 7.8 rebounds in the playoffs. Smith won Finals MVP honors as the Shock won their third WNBA title in six years. Unfortunately, the franchise was nearing its end in Detroit. The Shock played just one more season in the Motor City before moving to Tulsa in 2010. -- Voepel 29. 2003 Detroit Shock Regular season and playoff records: 25-9, 6-2 Defeated the Los Angeles Sparks 2-1 in Finals The Shock went from worst in 2002 (9-23) to first in 2003, ending the Sparks' attempt to three-peat. Former Pistons player Bill Laimbeer took over as Shock coach during the 2002 season and totally changed the team's culture. He drafted Cheryl Ford at No. 3 in 2003; she averaged a double-double (10.8 PPG, 10.4 RPG) and was Rookie of the Year. Cash, who had been the No. 2 pick in 2002, led the Shock with 16.6 points in the regular season and 16.3 in the playoffs. Detroit lost the Finals opener to Los Angeles, but survived Game 2, winning 62-61. In front of a huge crowd at The Palace at Auburn Hills, the Shock took the title in Game 3 in an 83-78 win, led by 27 points from Finals MVP Ruth Riley and Cash's near triple-double (13 points, 12 rebounds, 9 assists). ""I think our team really embodied the city of Detroit,"" Cash said. -- Voepel Detroit was the WNBA's least dominant best team, leading the league with 25 wins. The franchise's first playoff trip under Laimbeer started slowly, with the Shock going the distance to beat a 17-17 Cleveland Rockers team in the opening round, but Detroit found its footing in a conference finals sweep over Connecticut and then beat the two-time defending champion Sparks 2-1 in the Finals.",https://www.espn.com/wnba/story/_/id/46583911/wnba-finals-2025-ranking-every-wnba-champion-las-vegas-aces,Sport,BBC,,https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2025%2F1011%2Fr1558630_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg,,a41fc1d72c7fcd12536ade6b463065dfeb90ae00
47411488c86a,WNBA,,"Oct 13, 2025, 09:11 AM ET The 2025 season is in the books. A new champion has been crowned. But as the offseason starts, the focus shifts squarely back on collective bargaining negotiations. The current collective bargaining agreement expires on Oct. 31. Both commissioner Cathy Engelbert and the WNBA Players Association (WNBPA) have said their goal is a ""transformational"" CBA, but the two sides reportedly remain far apart in negotiations on the biggest issues. What are those priorities? What happens if a new CBA isn't reached by the deadline? How realistic is a lockout? Here's a run through everything to know. What are the players' biggest priorities? Increased player salaries is a key issue, but the most important is revenue sharing: how it's determined and whether the percentage will be allowed to grow during the course of the CBA instead of a fixed number for the duration of the deal. ""The players are still adamant that we get a percentage of revenue that grows with the business, which perhaps includes team revenue, and that's just a part of the conversation,"" WNBPA president Nneka Ogwumike told ESPN in early August. Phoenix Mercury forward Satou Sabally said a recent proposal from the WNBA makes the players feel as if ""we're not part of the growth of the league."" ""If we continued with this CBA, we would, percentage-wise, go down on our [compensation],"" Sabally said last week during the WNBA Finals. In the NBA, fans are used to salary caps for teams being set based on a percentage of what the CBA describes as ""basketball-related income,"" or BRI. By contrast, the WNBA's current CBA defined the cap for each season ahead of time with modest 3% annual raises. A mechanism in the CBA that would increase the cap based on revenue was effectively invalidated by the timing of the deal. Because the current CBA began in 2020 prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, revenue targets were set based on the previous campaign (2019) and made cumulative over the life of the deal. The league made no money off ticket sales during the abbreviated 2020 season, played in a bubble on the IMG Academy campus in Bradenton, Florida, and attendance was also limited in 2021 by local restrictions. That made it unrealistic for the targets to be met despite the league's increased attendance over the past two seasons. In August, Ogwumike said an offer from the WNBA dramatically increased the salary cap and maximum base salaries -- the supermax is $249,244 -- but followed the same model as the current CBA. ""It's basically the same system that we exist in right now,"" Ogwumike said. ""They're proposing a system that includes revenue that would grow with the business. When you approach it from the perspective of their response to our proposal, yes, money is more, but ultimately if you look at the growth of the business, the money relative to the percentage of everything is virtually staying the same."" A report Friday from Front Office Sports cited sources estimating a supermax salary around $850,000, with the veteran minimum around $300,000. ""There's a potential lockout. I promise you we aren't going to play until they give us what we deserve."" Indiana Fever guard Sophie Cunningham The players see the astonishing leap in franchise valuations in the past couple of years and question if they are getting their proper share of that growth. The Las Vegas Aces , for example, were purchased for $2 million in 2021 but are now valued at $310 million, and the New York Liberty were purchased for between $10 million and $14 million after being for sale for more than a year and now have an estimated valuation of around $450 million. On its face, that's a reasonable thing to ask. But what about the NBA's claims for years of subsidizing WNBA losses? Will the NBA say the new money is in part backfilling past deficits? Could it prove that? One of the most difficult parts of following the WNBA's labor negotiations all these years has been getting firm numbers from the league's side of things. The players have said they don't always feel like they get that. By the same token, the side we do hear much more from -- during every CBA -- is the players and their union. There has been dramatic change in the WNBA -- and what that indicates for the future -- in a short period of time after many years that seemed stagnant. The popularity of 2024 No. 1 draft pick Caitlin Clark has been an enormous boost for a league that had clearly started to turn the corner toward real growth over the past five years. If that growth continues as expected, it's understandable the players are concerned about how their part of the pie grows, too. ""We're seeing expansion, and the players are just saying, 'Hey, let us have our fair share of that,'"" Ogwumike said. ""Sometimes that means proposing something new that makes sense for the time. Not really new -- new to us, not to other leagues."" Prioritization is another issue that the players agreed to in the 2020 deal that they are expected to push back on more in these negotiations. Since the WNBA's launch, players have been allowed to play in other leagues -- mostly overseas -- even if that meant missing training camp or a few early-season WNBA games. New rules were put in place in the last CBA that required players to prioritize the WNBA. While there are built-in exceptions for younger players and time spent with players' national teams, prioritization has kept some players out of the WNBA for an entire season. Sabally said that players are in so many different situations based on where they are in their careers, how much money they make and if they are returning from injuries that she doesn't think it is beneficial to put restrictions on them playing in other leagues. But it seems unlikely the WNBA owners will completely back away from prioritization. Sabally also said she has talked with athletes in other basketball leagues, in other sports and in other countries about their own labor negotiations. ""It's interesting to hear about the flow of negotiations,"" she said. ""Sometimes you want results right away, but it does take time for both parties to come to the table and really agree on certain things."" What impact does the WNBA's broadcast rights deal have on negotiations? Last year, the league announced an 11-year deal -- which begins in 2026 -- with Disney, Amazon Prime Video and new rights holder NBCUniversal. The deal is valued at about $2.2 billion, a source told ESPN, but future agreements with additional partners could bring the league's overall media deals closer to $3 billion. According to sources, the agreement can be revisited after three years. The players see that money, along with the greatly increased expansion fees, and want to make sure they are getting what they think is a fair cut of it. Under the deal, Disney (using ABC and the ESPN networks) will telecast eight semifinals series and five Finals, while Prime and NBCU each will show seven semifinals and three Finals. WNBA players seem to have lost faith in Cathy Engelbert, who was booed by fans during the WNBA Finals trophy presentation. The support of Adam Silver and WNBA owners could ultimately determine whether she remains commissioner. AP Photo/John Locher How might the recent criticism of Engelbert impact negotiations? Engelbert was loudly booed by fans Friday in Phoenix when she presented the championship trophy to the Aces and the WNBA Finals MVP award to A'ja Wilson . Commissioners hearing fans' wrath in these situations is not new in pro sports -- the NHL's Gary Bettman and MLB's Rob Manfred have experienced the same treatment as recent examples -- but it has raised the issue of how the fractured relationship between Engelbert and the players will affect CBA negotiations. During a four-minute statement to open her exit interview on Sept. 30, Minnesota Lynx star Napheesa Collier said the WNBA had the ""worst leadership in the world ,"" accusing Engelbert of being ""negligent"" in her governance. Collier said the league has failed to sufficiently address issues with officiating, compensation for players and the state of the overall product. She also alleged that Engelbert told her in a private conversation in February that Clark and other young standouts ""should be on their knees"" in gratitude for the platform the league has given them. Three days later, the commissioner said there were ""a lot of inaccuracies"" in Collier's statement and vehemently denied saying the remarks about Clark. ""I did not make those comments,"" Engelbert said Oct. 3 at her annual news conference ahead of Game 1 of the WNBA Finals on Friday. Collier then canceled a meeting she and Engelbert had tentatively planned for the following week, sources told ESPN. Engelbert's assertion that Collier's depiction of the private conversation between them was filled with inaccuracies has ""pretty much pushed the relationship beyond repair,"" a source said. ""Sometimes you want results right away, but it does take time for both parties to come to the table and really agree on certain things."" Phoenix Mercury forward Satou Sabally On Oct. 6, as the Las Vegas Aces had taken a 2-0 lead over the Phoenix Mercury in the WNBA Finals, NBA commissioner Adam Silver said a new collective bargaining agreement with WNBA players will be reached but acknowledged relationship issues must be repaired following. ""There's no question that the WNBA is going through growing pains, and it's unfortunate that it's coming just as their most important games and their Finals are on right now,"" Silver said Monday. ""We've had two fantastic games so far, and we want to celebrate the game at the moment, and then we've got to sit down with the players and negotiate a new collective bargaining agreement."" Many WNBA players, including Ogwumike, have said they support Collier, but she didn't inform Ogwumike or the union about her statement before making it. It came at a difficult time for Collier, after she had suffered a season-ending injury in Game 3 of the semifinals, followed by the top-seeded Lynx being upset in the series by Phoenix. Whether the relationship between Engelbert and the players can be repaired would take a good faith effort from both sides, which might be even harder to make happen during CBA negotiations when tensions are always high. Ultimately, the support of Silver and the owners that Engelbert is representing in CBA talks is of utmost importance for her to stay in her position. play 4:24 WNBA commissioner on Collier's comments and officiating WNBA commissioner Cathy Engelbert discusses Napheesa Collier's comments and protocols surrounding officiating. What happens if a new deal isn't reached by Oct. 31? How realistic is a lockout? Failing to reach agreement by Halloween wouldn't necessarily translate into a lockout. Prior to the 2020 collective bargaining agreement, for example, the two sides extended the term of the previous CBA until they completed negotiations in mid-January on the eve of free agency. A work stoppage would be unprecedented in WNBA history. During exit interviews following the Indiana Fever's playoff elimination earlier this month, guard Sophie Cunningham said it is a possibility.

I promise you we aren't going to play until they give us what we deserve,"" she said. ""That's kind of where it's headed, unfortunately, which would be the dumbest basketball decision, business-wise, ever, considering the momentum the W has."" The WNBA might have more urgency this year because of everything that must be accomplished this offseason. With the Portland Fire and Toronto Tempo set to begin play in 2026 (and expansion to 18 teams by 2030), the league will need to hold an expansion draft and the draft lottery. Last year's Golden State Valkyries expansion draft was held Dec. 7, which gave the team time to prepare for free agency and players to promote their inaugural season. Although an offseason lockout would be disruptive, most notably by preventing players from utilizing team facilities to work out -- something that's more of an issue now than in 2020 with multiple teams building dedicated practice facilities that are available to players year-round -- the real concern is missing games. That's not in anyone's best interest. Specifically, owners have more at stake now that franchise valuations have escalated. Most explicitly in 2003, when negotiations on the WNBA's second CBA took until April to complete, players have always had to deal with the possibility that owners could withdraw their support for the league. With fierce competition for expansion teams, the WNBA is no longer at risk of going anywhere. That's increased player resolve to make a deal on their terms -- however long that means. ""I don't think anyone wants to see a lockout,"" Ogwumike told ESPN shortly after the All-Star Game. ""That's not something that we're advocating for. We just want to make sure that this is a deal that's done the right way and using whatever time it takes for us to be able to have both sides agree on something."" Key dates to know Something to watch is how the WNBA adjusts its timeline of key offseason events if the two sides mutually agree to an extension for CBA negotiations. A look at when events were held last offseason leading into the 2025 season: November and December: Expansion draft and draft lottery Last year's draft lottery was held Nov. 17. With Toronto and Portland joining the WNBA for 2026, the league will need to hold an expansion draft for a second consecutive year. In 2024, the WNBA held the Valkyries' expansion draft on Dec. 6. January to March: Unrivaled's second season Unrivaled doesn't have a direct impact on the WNBA, and its stakeholders have said they don't view it as competition for the WNBA. But Unrivaled -- the 3-on-3 league co-founded by Collier and Breanna Stewart -- will be a focal point for women's basketball this offseason. The amenities, quality of play and continued interest level in the league -- which will tip off its second season on Jan. 5, again based in Miami -- will be under a microscope. It will be a hub for free agents, general managers and agents during the offseason. January and February: WNBA free agency A mammoth free agency is expected this offseason as almost every player not currently on a rookie contract will be a free agent for the 2026 season. Earlier this year, WNBA free agency ran from Jan. 11 to Feb. 1: Jan. 11-20: Teams sent qualifying offers to designated players, making them either restricted free agents or core players. Jan. 21: The negotiation period for unrestricted free agents began. During this window, restricted free agents also negotiated with other teams during this time, with the original team having the right to match any offer. Feb. 1: Players officially signed contracts and free agent signings were announced. April: WNBA draft and training camps open The 2025 WNBA draft was held on April 14. WNBA training camps opened on April 27. May: WNBA season opens The 2025 season opened May 16.",https://www.espn.com/wnba/story/_/id/46578464/wnba-2025-collective-bargaining-agreement-cba-negotiations-salaries-rev-shares-lockout-engelbert,Sport,BBC,,https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2025%2F1013%2Fr1559484_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg,,f189f622fe9f5bbc719a4c438d04ecd77cd13865
412cf557f4cb,NFL Week 7 Power Rankings 2025: How all 32 teams stack up,,"Welcome to Week 7 of the 2025 NFL season . The Jets are still winless after losing to the Broncos in London. The Chiefs bounced back with a win over the Lions. And the Buccaneers are shockingly at the top of the NFC race. How do all of these teams fit in our updated Power Rankings? We restacked the NFL heading into Week 7, which includes byes for Buffalo and Baltimore. In addition to the 1-32 rankings, our NFL Nation reporters picked one lesson that we've learned from each team this season. Which teams and players are underperforming? What has surprisingly worked out for teams through six weeks? Let's get into it with our No. 1 team, which saw a change from last week . Our power panel of more than 80 writers, editors and TV personalities evaluated how NFL teams stack up against one another, ranking them from 1 to 32. Jump to a team: ARI | ATL | BAL | BUF | CAR | CHI | CIN CLE | DAL | DEN | DET | GB | HOU | IND JAX | KC | LAC | LAR | LV | MIA | MIN NE | NO | NYG | NYJ | PHI | PIT | SF SEA | TB | TEN | WSH Week 6 result: Beat the 49ers 30-19 Week 6 ranking: 4 Lesson learned: The Bucs are far better equipped to weather injuries. The Bucs lost three games last season without Mike Evans and Chris Godwin Jr ., and yet the past two weeks, Baker Mayfield and this defense have pulled off back-to-back victories without both receivers . In fact, Mayfield delivered this past Sunday's win with just one healthy starting skill player by the game's end in tight end Cade Otton . The Bucs were down to the fifth, sixth, seventh and eighth wide receivers -- two of whom scored their first NFL touchdowns. And the defense might be short at corner again, but its depth and its ability to get takeaways have catapulted Tampa Bay to the top of the NFC. -- Jenna Laine Week 6 result: Lost to the Chiefs 30-17 Week 6 ranking: 1 Lesson learned: Aidan Hutchinson has returned to elite form after severe leg injury . A broken leg ended Hutchinson's 2024 season early, but he picked up where he left off as one of the league's elite pass rushers. He set a single-season team record by producing at least 1.0 sacks in five consecutive games, in addition to another franchise mark of four straight games with a forced fumble. His 24 pressures is also the most in the NFL, as he's moving fluidly after a tough rehabilitation process. -- Eric Woodyard Week 6 result: Lost to the Falcons 24-14 Week 6 ranking: 2 Lesson learned: This Bills team still has a lot to learn about itself. Coming into the season, the hype for the Bills was high, with reigning MVP Josh Allen set for another big year. But if anything has been clear for this team through six games, it's that there are some major questions still to be answered to truly have a run at a Super Bowl title. Is the defense talented enough to put together a complete game? Is there enough talent at wide receiver to give Allen targets downfield? The limitations of this team have been clear, even in the wins, and there is work to be done. -- Alaina Getzenberg Week 6 result: Beat the Cardinals 31-27 Week 6 ranking: 5 Lesson learned: They were right about quarterback Daniel Jones . The Colts have a long way to go after playing a relatively soft schedule, but it's impossible to ignore what Jones has done since being handed the starting job in his first season in Indianapolis. Jones, who beat out incumbent starter Anthony Richardson Sr . in a preseason battle, leads the NFL in QBR (79.9) and is third in completion percentage (71.7%). Jones has also shown his versatility and toughness, as only the Eagles' Jalen Hurts (five) has more than Jones' four rushing touchdowns. -- Stephen Holder Week 6 result: Lost to the Giants 34-17 Week 6 ranking: 3 Lesson learned: Repeating as Super Bowl champions is hard. The offensive line is banged up and not performing to its usual dominant standard. Running back Saquon Barkley has less room to run, sending ripple effects across an offense that relied heavily on his production a year ago. The defense lost several key players and looks more vulnerable. The Eagles are playing a first-place schedule and have one of the most difficult slates in the NFL. Add all of that up and add the fact that every team they play is extra motivated to knock off the champs and you have one long road back toward a potential repeat. -- Tim McManus play 1:36 Schefter: NFL trades will happen this week Adam Schefter details to Pat McAfee the buyers and sellers in the NFL trade market. Week 6 result: Beat the Bengals 27-18 Week 6 ranking: 8 Lesson learned: Green Bay is playing with fire. The Packers are the only team in the NFL that has held a double-digit lead in every game this season. But in the past three games, those leads were not safe. They blew a 10-0 advantage in a 13-10 loss to the Browns. They were up 13-0 against the Cowboys but came away with a 40-40 tie . And in the latest game, they saw a 14-point second-half lead cut to six points against the Bengals. They've established a dangerous way to live. -- Rob Demovsky Week 6 result: Beat the Ravens 17-3 Week 6 ranking: 9 Lesson learned: The Rams need to figure out their kicking issues if they want to be Super Bowl contenders. The Rams' protection issues on special teams have led to four blocked kicks, and they again dealt with kicking woes in Week 6 when Joshua Karty missed a 26-yard field goal in the first quarter. ""I thought the protection was good,"" head coach Sean McVay said. ""We've got to make the kick. We ended up missing the kick. Ended up hitting the second one not very clean right there. The snap felt like it was a little bit high."" The Rams have had two extra points blocked this season, which is as many as the rest of the league combined, according to ESPN Research. -- Sarah Barshop Week 6 result: Beat the Jaguars 20-12 Week 6 ranking: 11 Lesson learned: Don't count out a first-round pick after one underwhelming season. Defensive tackle Byron Murphy II is showing why. The No. 16 selection in 2024 was plenty disruptive as a rookie but not productive, finishing with half a sack and two tackles for loss in 14 games. But he's making a massive second-year jump. Along with seven pressures, Murphy had two sacks Sunday to give him a team-high 4.5 through six games. Defensive end DeMarcus Lawrence also said Murphy is ""hands down"" the team's best run defender. -- Brady Henderson Week 6 result: Beat the Lions 30-17 Week 6 ranking: 7 Lesson learned: The offensive line is no longer an issue. Much of the Chiefs' offseason was about general manager Brett Veach and coach Andy Reid fixing the offensive line , especially at left tackle. The Chiefs signed left tackle Jaylon Moore in free agency and selected rookie left tackle Josh Simmons in the draft. They also moved Kingsley Suamataia to left guard to replace Joe Thuney , who was traded to the Bears. Each player in the trio has performed well, making the offensive line a strength once again for quarterback Patrick Mahomes . -- Nate Taylor play 1:35 Does the road to the Super Bowl go through the Chiefs? Adam Schefter, Damien Woody and Tedy Bruschi discuss the Chiefs' chances of returning to another Super Bowl. Week 6 result: Beat the Jets 13-11 Week 6 ranking: 10 Lesson learned: Don't look now, but coach Sean Payton has a team powered by defense. Payton's offensive résumé was a big part of why he was hired in 2023 , but the Broncos are 4-2 because of a defense that leads the league in sacks (30), defensive expected points added (31.43) and opposing QBR (43.5). Cornerback Pat Surtain II continues to vex the league's top receivers, and outside linebacker Nik Bonitto is tied for the NFL lead in sacks (seven). Denver pressures across the defensive front and has the secondary depth to play any nickel or dime variations. The Broncos' aggression has surrendered a big play or two -- see Weeks 2 and 3 -- but they have overcome their bobbles on offense and special teams with a playoff-worthy defense. -- Jeff Legwold Week 6 result: Lost to the Buccaneers 30-19 Week 6 ranking: 6 Lesson learned: The 49ers are tough, but that might not be enough to offset their injuries. The Niners looked destined to lose at some point in all six of their games, yet they found a way to win four of them. That's a credit to coach Kyle Shanahan and his staff, as well as the veteran leaders charged with setting a standard. But the 49ers have again been ravaged by injury, losing star defensive end Nick Bosa ( knee ) and linebacker Fred Warner ( ankle ) for the season in addition to other injuries to key players. Resilience is an important trait for any NFL team, but eventually talent trumps intangibles. That means things are only going to get more difficult for San Francisco. -- Nick Wagoner Week 6 result: Beat the Browns 23-9 Week 6 ranking: 13 Lesson learned: Aaron Rodgers doesn't have to do it all alone. The Steelers lead the league in average yards after catch per reception (7.3) but are last in air yards per target (5.3). That means they're not relying on their 41-year-old quarterback to heave it down the field for splash plays. Instead, the recipe of getting the ball out of his hands quickly and into the arms of his playmakers is working for a Steelers offense averaging a respectable 23.8 points. Aaron Rodgers ' 49.0 total QBR ranks 22nd in the league, but he's completing 68.8% of his attempts (12th best). -- Brooke Pryor play 1:09 McAfee: This is the best Aaron Rodgers has looked in years Pat McAfee is very impressed by what he has seen from Aaron Rodgers and the Steelers offense this season. Week 6 result: Beat the Dolphins 29-27 Week 6 ranking: 14 Lesson learned: Offensive coordinator Greg Roman has evolved. Roman resigned as Baltimore's offensive coordinator after the 2022 season amid criticism from players and fans about the team's unimaginative passing offense. Three seasons later, he leads one of the league's best passing offenses. The Chargers' run game has fluctuated, with injuries to the offensive line and backfield. Their strongest position on offense is at receiver, so Roman has leaned on his pass catchers and quarterback Justin Herbert to make plays. Herbert is eighth in the NFL in passing yards (1,493) this season. -- Kris Rhim Week 6 result: Beat the Saints 25-19 Week 6 ranking: 17 Lesson learned: QB Drake Maye has taken the second-year leap. Maye passed for 261 yards and three touchdowns against the Saints, with a 140.1 passer rating. He became the fourth player in NFL history under 24 years old to record at least 200 passing yards and a passing rating of 100 or higher in five straight games, joining Patrick Mahomes (seven straight in 2018 and five in 2018-19), Dan Marino (six in 1984) and Dak Prescott (five in 2016). -- Mike Reiss All of ESPN. All in one place. Watch your favorite events in the newly enhanced ESPN App. Learn more about what plan is right for you. Sign Up Now Week 6 result: Lost to the Seahawks 20-12 Week 6 ranking: 15 Lesson learned: The pass rush is their No. 1 weakness. The Jaguars are 13th in the NFL in quarterback pressures (73) but have managed just eight sacks -- the third-lowest total in the league. Josh Hines-Allen has managed just half a sack; Travon Walker has two; and Dawuane Smoot has one. That's the production of the team's top three edge rushers six games into the season, which equals defensive tackle Arik Armstead 's season total on his own. -- Mike DiRocco Week 6 result: Beat the Bills 24-14 Week 6 ranking: 19 Lesson learned: Running back Bijan Robinson is the offense's focal point. In his third season, Robinson has emerged as one of the league's elite offensive weapons. On Monday night, he might have made himself an MVP candidate with 238 yards from scrimmage, including an 81-yard touchdown against the Bills. Robinson leads the NFL with 164.4 yards from scrimmage per game. He's only the second player ever to have 450 rushing yards and 300 receiving yards through five games. The other was Thurman Thomas in 1991. -- Marc Raimondi Week 6 result: Lost to the Bears 25-24 Week 6 ranking: 14 Lesson learned: Javon Kinlaw 's deal has been a bargain. When Washington signed the veteran defensive tackle to a contract that averaged $15 million per year, many scratched their heads. But Kinlaw ranks 13th among defensive tackles with a 40.2% run stop win rate (his previous career best was 35%). He has been credited with seven run stops, already a career high. Washington wanted Kinlaw because it believed he was still ascending after multiple injuries hampered his growth. He has now been healthy for two straight seasons and is really producing. Washington's run defense still needs some work -- it ranks 20th after finishing 30th last season -- even with Kinlaw doing his part. -- John Keim Week 6 result: Bye Week 6 ranking: 16 Lesson learned: QB decisions are open to scrutiny. The team decided against using the franchise tag on Sam Darnold , couldn't re-sign Daniel Jones, passed on Aaron Rodgers and then traded for Sam Howell . Those moves were all in service of elevating J.J. McCarthy , the No. 10 pick in 2024. It was a defensible position, considering the value of McCarthy's rookie contract, but McCarthy produced the NFL's second-worst QBR in the first two weeks and has since been sidelined by a high right ankle sprain . Meanwhile, Jones and Darnold rank first and third, respectively, in QBR. Rodgers beat them with the Steelers in Week 4 , and Carson Wentz has started three games after replacing Howell just before the start of the season. -- Kevin Seifert Week 6 result: Beat the Commanders 25-24 Week 6 ranking: 20 Lesson learned: Chicago is learning how to win close games. A year ago, the Bears weren't equipped to pull off consecutive come-from-behind wins the way they did to beat the Raiders and Commanders. Chicago's identical 25-24 victories in Week 4 and Week 6 came down to special teams plays in the game's final moments, with Josh Blackwell blocking a field goal against the Raiders and Jake Moody booting a 38-yard game winner against the Commanders -- the day he was elevated from the practice squad. Entering Week 6, the Bears had lost 28 straight games when trailing by eight or more points in the fourth quarter. On Monday night, Chicago flipped the script on the idea that it couldn't end up on the winning end of tight games. ""I feel like we're trending up,"" safety Jaquan Brisker said. ""In the past, we might have gave up, but guys stayed true. Guys never gave up."" -- Courtney Cronin Week 6 result: Bye Week 6 ranking: 18 Lesson learned: The Texans have a premier defense. They have the No. 1 scoring defense -- allowing 12.2 points per game -- and it's not as if they've played offensive bottom-feeders. Houston earned that ranking after playing the Buccaneers (sixth in points per game), Rams (16th) and Jaguars (17th). Those teams are a combined 13-5 on the season, so the Texans have faced respectable competition en route to their No. 1 status. They are also third best in the league in pass rush win rate (47.1%), behind the Steelers and Browns. -- DJ Bien-Aime Week 6 result: Beat the Cowboys 3 0-27 Week 6 ranking: 24 Lesson learned: The Panthers can win by dominating the ground game A big reason the Panthers put up historically bad numbers against the run last season was because they lost Derrick Brown to a season-ending knee injury in Week 1. His presence, along with free agent additions to the front seven, has been a big reason Carolina allowed only 50 rushing yards in the past two games combined. As Coach Dave Canales has said repeatedly, everyone up front thrives off Brown. Meanwhile, Carolina's rushing offense has thrived since moving Rico Dowdle into the lead role. He's the second player with at least 200 scrimmage yards in each of his first two starts with a franchise since the 1970 merger, joining Billy Sims in 1980 with the Lions, per ESPN Research. -- David Newton play 1:17 Orlovsky impressed by Panthers' win over Cowboys Dan Orlovsky talks to Pat McAfee about the Panthers' dominant O-line performance against the Cowboys. Week 6 result: Lost to the Panthers 30-27 Week 6 ranking: 21 Lesson learned: There are no answers on defense. The Cowboys have given up 21 pass plays of 20-plus yards and 24 runs of 10-plus yards this season. They have been lit up by quarterbacks Russell Wilson , Caleb Williams and Bryce Young . They don't affect the quarterback (11 sacks). They can't take the ball away enough (four turnovers). They can't stop teams on third down with teams converting 53% of the time. The Cowboys are last in yards (411.7) and passing yards (269.5); they are 31st in points per game (30.7). -- Todd Archer Week 6 result: Lost to the Colts 31-27 Week 6 ranking: 23 Lesson learned: The Cardinals can't close out games. Arizona lost its first three games on walk-off field goals, becoming the first team since the 1970 merger to do so, per ESPN Research. The Cardinals' efforts to come back Sunday in Indianapolis stalled at the 9-yard line with under a minute left in the fourth quarter. Arizona can't close out games when it's ahead or when it's trailing. And while it has been a costly pain point this season, it has also been a point of emphasis as something to improve. -- Josh Weinfuss Week 6 result: Lost to the Rams 17-3 Week 6 ranking: 22 Lesson learned: The Ravens can't win without Lamar Jackson . Baltimore signed Cooper Rush to a two-year, $6.2 million deal (including $4 million guaranteed) with the hope he could keep the Ravens in contention if Jackson suffered a short-term injury. But Baltimore is 0-2 and has produced a total of 13 points without Jackson ( hamstring injury ) this season. Rush, who went 9-5 as a fill-in quarterback in Dallas, has thrown four interceptions and no touchdowns with Baltimore. The good news for the Ravens is that coach John Harbaugh expects Jackson to return after this week's bye. -- Jamison Hensley Week 6 result: Beat the Eagles 34-17 Week 6 ranking: 30 Lesson learned: Jaxson Dart might actually be the guy. It has been only three starts , but Dart has shown signs of being a franchise quarterback. That was especially apparent as he led the Giants to upset wins over the Chargers and Eagles. Three quarterbacks have rushed for at least 50 yards in their first three starts -- Lamar Jackson, Jalen Hurts and now Dart. Perhaps more importantly, Dart and rookie running back Cam Skattebo have injected life into the Giants. ""Their energy is contagious,"" cornerback Cor'Dale Flott said. -- Jordan Raanan Your League, Your Rules Create a league and customize league size, scoring and rules to play in the league you want to play in. Create a league today! Week 6 result: Beat the Titans 20-10 Week 6 ranking: 29 Lesson learned: Patience will be the key to Pete Carroll's tenure in Las Vegas. When Carroll took the job , he was determined to turn the Raiders into immediate playoff contenders. However, that process might take longer than expected. The Raiders have a new quarterback ( Geno Smith ) and offensive coordinator (Chip Kelly) and are reliant on young players at key positions. And with general manager John Spytek a believer in building through the draft, Las Vegas will not turn things around overnight. -- Ryan McFadden Week 6 result: Lost to the Packers 27-18 Week 6 ranking: 25 Lesson learned: The future of the defense is murky. Coming into the season, Cincinnati hoped new defensive coordinator Al Golden could transform a unit that really struggled last season. While there have been positive moments, some of the key players aren't playing as well as needed. The Bengals have already made a major switch at middle linebacker, with rookie Barrett Carter taking over for veteran Logan Wilson , a team captain. But other players, such as cornerback Cam Taylor-Britt , have not performed well enough either. A team that spent heavily on offense needs its young defenders to provide adequate play, which could be an issue beyond this season. -- Ben Baby Week 6 result: Lost to the Patriots 25-19 Week 6 ranking: 27 Lesson learned: Scoring touchdowns will be a seasonlong problem. Tight end Taysom Hill gave the Saints a boost by scoring from the 1-yard line against the Patriots, but the past two weeks have been a collection of field goals by New Orleans, which attempted 10 (making eight) versus just two touchdowns. Failing to get in the end zone will continue to lose the Saints games, and drives have stalled for a variety of reasons: turnovers, penalties and sacks being some of them. -- Katherine Terrell Week 6 result: Lost to the Steelers 23-9 Week 6 ranking: 26 Lesson learned: The Browns' "" strategic pivot "" is coming with all the expected growing pains. Cleveland is fielding one of the NFL's youngest rosters with 14 rookies in an attempt to rebuild its foundation, a move that general manager Andrew Berry called a ""strategic pivot"" during the offseason. Between their youth and no clear answer at quarterback, the Browns have had a frustrating start that has been highlighted by the league's lowest-scoring offense (13.67 points per game) and the third-worst point differential (minus-.64). -- Daniel Oyefusi Week 6 result: Lost to the Chargers 29-27 Week 6 ranking: 28 Lesson learned: The Dolphins' defense has taken a dramatic step back from a season ago. There were plenty of reasonable concerns this offseason after Miami parted ways with four members of its 2024 starting secondary. General manager Chris Grier rebounded nicely, adding experienced starters Minkah Fitzpatrick , Jack Jones and Rasul Douglas , but the Dolphins believed a talented front seven would hold down the fort while the secondary jelled. Instead, Miami is tied for the 18th-most sacks (12) and allows a league-worst 168.5 rushing yards per game. After two consecutive top-10 finishes in yards allowed per game, the Dolphins rank 30th in the same category this season. It might not change much if the team decides to trade away players at the deadline. -- Marcel Louis-Jacques play 1:22 Why Stephen A. puts Dolphins' woes on McDaniel, not Tua Stephen A. Smith explains why Dolphins coach Mike McDaniel needs to be fired after Tua Tagovailoa expressed his frustrations. Week 6 result: Lost to the Raiders 20-10 Week 6 ranking: 31 Lesson learned: This team is actually worse than we thought it was. It's hard to imagine the Titans being worse than last season after selecting QB Cam Ward with the No. 1 pick. But here we are. The Titans' offense has scored only 83 points, which is the least by a Titans/Oilers team through six games since 1985, per ESPN Research. The Titans' loss to the Raiders was their fourth by 10-plus points this season, the most in the NFL. No one expected Tennessee to compete for a division title. But there were supposed to be signs of growth in Year 2 under Brian Callahan, who was fired Monday . Ward is the fourth consecutive quarterback drafted No. 1 to see his coach dismissed during his rookie season. -- Turron Davenport Week 6 result: Lost to the Broncos 13-11 Week 6 ranking: 32 Lesson learned: Aaron Glenn isn't a quick-fix coach. No one expected the Jets to be a playoff team in Glenn's first season, but they weren't expected to be 0-6. Compared with last season (5-12), the Jets have regressed on both sides of the ball, finding new ways to lose every week. Glenn talked tough at the outset, promising to exorcise past demons, but his lack of head coaching experience is apparent at times. He walked into a herculean challenge. If he doesn't find some wins soon, his locker room could start to fracture. Welcome to the Jets. -- Rich Cimini",https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/46521411/nfl-week-7-power-rankings-poll-32-teams-2025-biggest-lessons,Sport,BBC,,https://a1.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2025%2F1013%2Fnfl_power6_cr_16x9.jpg,,eae2714618fdf760de0b0751850f2983920bb237
e01210693e76,MLB,,"What an incredible first two weeks of the 2025 MLB playoffs we've had. There was the instant classic 15-inning Game 5 of the American League Division Series between the Detroit Tigers and Seattle Mariners , sending Seattle to its first American League Championship Series since 2001. We saw the Philadelphia Phillies be eliminated by the Los Angeles Dodgers on a bases-loaded error in the 11th inning. We watched the Toronto Blue Jays stomp past the New York Yankees with a barrage of scoring. Now, we're in the early stages of the league championship series and down to the final four teams: one team that is trying to make history with back-to-back titles, two teams trying to win their first title and one team trying to bring back its glory days of the early 1990s. The Mariners surprised everyone by going into Toronto and winning the first two games. The Dodgers held on to a slim lead to take Game 1 in Milwaukee. Let's take stock of October so far with an edition of Real or Not, looking at storylines on the teams still alive and those that have been eliminated. Teams that are still in it The Dodgers are the team to beat ... again Verdict: Real Look. They're the defending champs. They have a rotation of All-Stars. They have Shohei Ohtani . They seem to have found a closer in Roki Sasaki . They are the favorite to win it all. Just listen to a few statements Milwaukee Brewers manager Pat Murphy made Sunday: ""The Dodgers are a powerhouse, what can you say?"" ""I happen to think that Mookie Betts is one of the most underrated stars -- I say 'underrated,' that's kind of crazy, right? But I don't think Mookie Betts gets the credit."" ""Freddie Freeman is like my favorite person, player in the game. He's ruined Brewers history many times, but I still love him."" ""My impressions as a pitcher is that [Ohtani is] unbelievable. The game I saw him pitch the other day was, like, uh, a split-finger from the top of the zone all the way to the bottom. Amazing."" ""The other kid is pretty good, the lefty. What's his name? Shell? [Blake] Snell. I'm joking, of course. I've been very disappointed when he's pitched and I'm in the stadium. He's really good."" ""And [Tyler] Glasnow is really good. And [Yoshinobu] Yamamoto is really good. The guy at the end -- who is the guy at the end throwing 100 with a split? That shouldn't be fair. We're going to try to petition the league and see if we can get him suspended for something."" So, yes, the Dodgers are the favorite. But no team has repeated since the Yankees in 2000. It won't be easy. The Blue Jays' ability to put the ball in play makes them the biggest threat to L.A.'s throne Verdict: Not Real The Blue Jays did have the lowest strikeout rate in the majors this season at 17.3% and are coming off a dominant offensive division series against the Yankees. The Brewers, however, had the fifth-lowest strikeout rate and actually scored a few more runs than the Blue Jays this season. Keep in mind that Bo Bichette , one of Toronto's best offensive players in the regular season, will sit out the ALCS because of a knee injury , and even if the Blue Jays advance without him and he can hit in the World Series, he last played a game on Sept. 6. As the first game against the Mariners showed, it seems everyone was overreacting just a bit to the Yankees' series, when the Blue Jays hit .338. I mean, utility infielder Ernie Clement hit .643! That's not going to continue all October. That said, team contact rate is a strong October indicator. Look at the leaguewide regular-season strikeout rates (and rankings) of recent World Series winners: 2024 Dodgers: 11th (21.4%) 2023 Texas Rangers : 15th (22.5%) 2022 Houston Astros : second (19.5%) 2021 Atlanta Braves : 16th (22.7%, position players only) 2020 Dodgers: second (20.3%) 2019 Washington Nationals : third (19.8%, position players only) 2018 Boston Red Sox : fifth (19.8%) Of course, pitching matters, and we'll see how Toronto's depth plays out, especially in the bullpen. Milwaukee's pitching -- with the creative and nontraditional ways Murphy deploys it, including in the bullpen -- is better than Toronto's. Let's call the Blue Jays and Brewers co-upset favorites. Strikeout rate does project as a problem for the Mariners, who ranked 24th in the majors at 23.3%. The Dodgers? They were 12th at 21.9%, so about the same as last season. Verdict: Real? Through the division series, it certainly looked as if it was Vladimir Guerrero Jr ., who hit .529/.550/1.059 with three home runs and nine RBIs in four games against the Yankees. Guerrero is exactly what you want for an October lineup anchor: a hitter who hits for a high average with power, an excellent contact rate (he finished 19th in highest contact rate among qualified hitters) and a low chase rate (90th percentile). But after the Mariners won the first two games in Toronto, a new potential star is brewing thanks to the clutch hitting of Polanco. Check out his big moments so far: • Hit two home runs off Tarik Skubal in Game 2 of the ALDS, the only runs off Skubal, in a game the Mariners eventually won 3-2. • Walked and scored the tying run in the seventh inning of Game 5 of the ALDS -- and delivered the series-winning walk-off hit in the 15th. • Delivered the go-ahead, two-out single in the sixth inning of Game 1 of the ALCS and then another RBI single in the eighth in Seattle's 3-1 victory. • Went 2-for-5 with two runs and the go-ahead three-run home run in Seattle's Game 2 win. Polanco is the first player in MLB history to have a go-ahead hit in the fifth inning or later of three consecutive playoff games. His overall line doesn't scream domination -- .258/.303/.548, three home runs, eight RBIs -- but he has been in the middle of the key moments for the Mariners so far as they sit two wins away from their first World Series appearance. Others off to hot starts: Guerrero: .375/.429/.750, 3 HR, 9 RBIs Cal Raleigh : .357/.471/.607, 2 HR, 5 RBIs Clement: .476/.478/.667, 1 HR, 5 RBIs Jackson Chourio : .333/.348/.571, 1 HR, 7 RBIs Teoscar Hernandez : .276/.323/.621, 3 HR, 9 RBIs How the Dodgers fixed Roki Sasaki After a disastrous MLB debut, L.A.'s new ninth-inning man has unleashed jaw-dropping stuff in October. Jeff Passan » And if you want an October MVP sleeper: Roki Sasaki , who's doing his best Mariano Rivera impersonation (at least until his shaky performance in Game 1 against the Brewers, in which Blake Treinen had to rescue him to get the final out after Sasaki gave up two walks and one run). The Dodgers entered the postseason with no idea who their closer would be -- and Sasaki has stepped up. Check out his first four appearances: Oct. 1 vs. Cincinnati Reds : Closed out an 8-4 win with a two-strikeout ninth. Oct. 4 at Phillies: Closed out a 5-3 win. Oct. 6 at Phillies: After the rest of the pen nearly blew it, he got the final out in a 4-3 win. Oct. 9 vs. Phillies: Pitched three perfect innings in the Dodgers' 11-inning, 2-1 win to eliminate Philly. We're about to witness Shohei Ohtani 's October breakout Verdict: Not Real I could be wrong -- you should never bet against Ohtani. Of course, he already has made his pitching breakout, beating the Phillies with six solid innings (three runs, nine strikeouts). He did homer twice in the wild-card opener against the Reds but then went 1-for-18 against the Phillies with nine strikeouts. Granted, he faced three of the toughest lefties in the game in that series -- but remember, he was only so-so last postseason (by his own impossible standards), hitting .230/.373/.393. As hard as he pushes himself all season, and now that he's also pitching again, it's a lot to ask of him to keep crushing baseball at this regular-season rate. Consider this nugget of information as well: Ohtani ranked second overall in the majors in OPS in the regular season (1.014); but against pitches of 97 mph or faster, he drops to 21st in OPS (.889). That's still awesome. Just not quite as awesome. The Brewers have four pitchers who average 97-plus with their fastballs in Jacob Misiorowski , Trevor Megill , Abner Uribe and Aaron Ashby , plus Jared Koenig (averages 96, touches 99), Nick Mears (averages 95.4, touches 98) and Freddy Peralta (averages 94.8, touches 97-98). Two of those are lefty relievers -- Ashby and Koenig -- and they're going to face Ohtani a lot in this series. Ohtani knows what he's going to get. Let 'er rip (on both sides). The Mariners' vibes are enough to power them through October Verdict: Real Well, vibes don't necessarily win games, but home runs, good starting pitching and strong bullpens do. Sunday's game was unbelievably huge for Seattle, as the Mariners were coming off that exhausting 15-inning game to beat Detroit, flying from Seattle to Toronto, having to use their No. 5 starter Bryce Miller , who had a 5.68 ERA in the regular season, against Blue Jays ace Kevin Gausman -- and winning. It was interesting that Toronto manager John Schneider pulled Gausman after a two-out walk to Julio Rodriguez (which came after the Cal Raleigh home run that tied the score), despite Gausman having thrown only 76 pitches. Rodriguez then scored on a wild pitch and Jorge Polanco 's go-ahead single. Miller, meanwhile, also issued a two-out walk in the bottom of the sixth, but Seattle manager Dan Wilson left him in and he got the final out of the inning. The bullpen then finished it off with three hitless innings over only 24 pitches. Game 2 hinged on another critical Schneider decision when he elected to intentionally walk Raleigh with no outs after Randy Arozarena led off the fifth by reaching second base on an infield single and throwing error. A no-out intentional walk increases the potential for a big inning and that's exactly what happened. Schneider pulled Trey Yesavage and brought in Louis Varland , who struck out  Rodriguez but then got taken deep by Polanco, who blasted that three-run home run to make it 6-3. The Big Dumper ... and some magic? Seattle has never won a World Series. Or even an American League pennant. Could a little bit of alchemy change that? Alden Gonzalez » That's certainly one way to create good vibes. Look, the Mariners strike out a lot. Even in the Game 1 victory against the Blue Jays, they fanned 11 times compared to only four for Toronto. They struck out 20 times in the 15-inning win against the Tigers. Eugenio Suarez is 4-for-29 in the postseason with 12 strikeouts. Rodriguez is 6-for-29 with 13 strikeouts. Maybe the strikeouts will eventually end up as the Mariners' fatal flaw. So far, their pitching and power has carried them. But keep in mind that they scored only 32 fewer runs than the Blue Jays in the regular season, despite playing at pitcher-friendly T-Mobile Park. If they stay hot at the plate the way they were in Game 2, they can power their way into the World Series. Blake Snell looks like The Man on the mound this postseason Verdict: Real Some years, the postseason is all about the bullpens. And some years, we get a red-hot starter who delivers all October, like these pitchers from past World Series-winning teams: 2023: Nathan Eovaldi , Rangers (5-0, 2.95 ERA) 2022: Framber Valdez , Astros (3-0, 1.44 ERA) 2019: Stephen Strasburg, Nationals (5-0, 1.98 ERA) 2017: Justin Verlander , Astros (4-1, 2.21 ERA) 2014: Madison Bumgarner, San Francisco Giants (4-1, 1.03 ERA, one big save) This might be Snell's October to remember. Against the Reds in the wild-card round, he gave up two runs in seven innings, taking a shutout into the seventh. Against the Phillies he picked up another win with six scoreless innings in a duel against Cristopher Sanchez . Then, Snell delivered maybe the best starting pitcher performance this decade with his brilliant one-hit, 10-strikeout game over eight innings to beat the Brewers and run his record to 3-0 with a 0.86 ERA in the postseason. Snell made only 11 starts in the regular season, sitting out four months, and L.A. manager Dave Roberts said before Game 1 that the Dodgers probably did slow-play Snell's return to have him ready for October. ""Could he have probably pitched earlier? Possibly,"" Roberts said. ""But when you're talking about that kind of arm, the term of the contract, the shorter term, the season, making sure that he is raring to go for the postseason, through the postseason. So that was certainly part of the math."" For Snell, he's determined to keep pitching deeper into games. Before this year, he had made 10 career postseason starts and never completed six innings. ""I think it's just mindset,"" said Snell, who was notoriously unhappy with Tampa Bay Rays manager Kevin Cash pulling him in Game 6 of the 2020 World Series after 73 pitches with a 1-0 lead, only to see the Rays lose the game. ""As you get older, you learn a lot more, you understand pitching, you understand how important belief is. And you just get better just with age and understanding the game and situations and what pressure really is and how awesome these moments are."" Teams that have been eliminated The Phillies will look vastly different when we see them next Verdict: Not Real Offseason questions for eliminated teams Here's how the winter looks in Philly -- and in all the towns whose teams made an early exit from the 2025 MLB playoffs. Story » After the tough four-game loss to the Dodgers, the discussion was how this might be the end of an era for the Phillies . Kyle Schwarber , J.T. Realmuto and Ranger Suarez -- all key members of the core group that has made four consecutive playoff appearances and remained remarkably intact -- are all free agents after this season, as is Max Kepler and perhaps Harrison Bader (he has a $10 million mutual option). Six of the regular position players are older than 30. And, quite simply, this group hasn't gotten it done in the postseason the past three years, especially at the plate. Thus: Blow it all up! Or at least some of it. But I just don't see it. This was a 96-win team, and it's certainly not in the DNA of owner John Middleton and top executive Dave Dombrowski to do anything except keep pushing for a World Series title. Most people in baseball can't see the Phillies letting Schwarber leave, although there will obviously be interest in him coming off a 56-home run season (the New York Mets , no doubt, are a potentially interested party). Realmuto is a risky signing as he turns 35, but the Phillies don't have a good alternative at catcher. Suarez is probably the one most likely to leave, just because of the demand for pitchers in free agency. If there are changes, it might be with Bryson Stott and Alec Bohm . Stott has hit .179 with four RBIs in his past 17 postseason games. In his 38-game postseason career, Bohm has hit .225 with only two home runs and 14 RBIs -- often hitting third or fourth in the lineup. The Phillies would probably like to move on from Nick Castellanos , who will make $20 million in the final year of his contract, but there won't be any trade interest in a player coming off a minus-1.0 WAR season. So, different? Maybe a bit. Vastly different? Probably not. Having a true ace no longer guarantees October success Verdict: Real Tarik Skubal? Gone. Garrett Crochet ? Gone. Cristopher Sanchez? Gone. Those three ranked first (Sanchez), third (Skubal) and fourth (Crochet) in Baseball-Reference WAR among pitchers ( Paul Skenes , whose Pittsburgh Pirates didn't make the playoffs, was second). Look, all three pitched great in October. Skubal gave up four runs in three starts and struck out 36 batters in 20⅔ innings; the Tigers lost two of those games anyway. Crochet won his start in the wild-card series, but the Boston Red Sox lost the other two games to the Yankees. Sanchez gave up three runs over two starts against the Dodgers, but the Phillies lost both after he departed. Though the aces weren't to blame -- you still need your offense to score runs -- their inability to pitch deeper into games played a role here as managers are increasingly likely to pull their starter before 100 pitches, even if he's one of the best starters in baseball. In his Game 5 start against Seattle, Skubal was pulled after six innings and 99 pitches. The Mariners tied the score in the seventh. In his first start against the Dodgers, Sanchez couldn't quite make it through the sixth inning, giving up two runs and leaving after 94 pitches with a lead, but the Dodgers beat the Phillies' bullpen. Perhaps it's instructive that the Red Sox won Crochet's start 3-1, in part because he threw 117 pitches and left only four outs to the bullpen. Aces are still enormously valuable. But they're less valuable than they used to be if they're only throwing six innings and 90-something pitches. Aaron Judge finally silenced his October critics -- for good Verdict: Not Real Judge had a terrific postseason, hitting .500/.581/.692 with seven RBIs in seven games. His .500 average was the third highest in a single postseason (minimum 30 plate appearances) and his 253 wRC+ is in the top 15. Another wasted year of Aaron Judge Will the captain end up the greatest Yankee never to win a World Series -- or can the Bombers build a championship team around him? Jorge Castillo » But silence his critics? Nope. This is New York and -- fair or not -- until Judge helps lift the Yankees to a World Series championship, he'll face the pressure of expectations every October in which he plays. Consider Ted Williams. He played in one World Series, hit .200 with one RBI and spent the rest of his career with the reputation that he wasn't clutch. Consider Barry Bonds. He was terrible in three NLCS with the Pirates early in his career, and even after one of the greatest postseasons of all time in 2002 (.356, eight home runs, 1.556 OPS), critics will point out that he wasn't clutch in the playoffs and never won a ring. That's the burden Judge has to carry as one of the greatest hitters of all time. This was the San Diego Padres ' last best shot at a deep postseason run Verdict: Real Never say never, but the future path to continued success for the Padres is littered with mega-contract-sized potholes. First, in the immediate future, they'll have to address their starting rotation with Michael King , Dylan Cease and Nestor Cortes heading to free agency. The problem: The farm system is weak and the payroll more bloated than two servings of the ""Cardiff crack"" nachos at Petco Park. Next up, the contracts: Manny Machado made $17.1 million this season but his salary jumps up to $39 million in 2027 -- and his contract runs through 2033; Xander Bogaerts , at $25 million a year and coming off an 11-homer season, is signed through 2033; Fernando Tatis Jr .'s salary eventually jumps from $20.7 million in 2025 to $35.7 million in 2029. Joe Musgrove (two more seasons) and Yu Darvish (three more) are still under contract. The Padres are getting older and more expensive. Maybe they'll try to stretch it one more year behind their bullpen, but the bottom here -- when it arrives -- might not be pretty. The state of Ohio had two playoff teams -- two more than it'll have in 2026 Verdict: Not Real The Cleveland Guardians are coming off their shocking 88-win division title and the Reds won 83 and made the playoffs in a full season for the first time since 2013. It's easy to dismiss both team's chances in 2026: Cleveland had trouble scoring runs all season and Cincinnati didn't exactly roll out the Big Red Machine on offense. The Guardians have the advantage of playing in the AL Central, where no team except Cleveland in the past four seasons has won more than 87 games (the Guardians have done it three times). Both teams will enter 2026 relying again on run prevention while lacking the committed owners needed to invest in some upgrades on offense. I would still put the odds of at least one of them making the playoffs next season at better than 50% and I especially like where the Reds sit with their rotation. With Hunter Greene , Nick Lodolo , Andrew Abbott and Brady Singer , they finished third in FanGraphs WAR among starting rotations. But then they have two big arms to add in 2026: Chase Burns , the No. 2 pick in the 2024 draft who debuted with the Reds this season and struck out 67 batters in 43 innings; and Rhett Lowder , the seventh pick in 2023 who debuted with the Reds in 2024 but sat out much of 2025 because of a forearm strain and then an oblique strain. Best possible World Series matchups Never-before-seen history? A battle of villains?! Here are the best remaining showdowns for every type of fan. David Schoenfield » With Nick Martinez headed to free agency after making $21 million in 2025, the Reds can invest that money in some offense. Sal Stewart , who looked good in 18 late-season games with the Reds, has a chance to be an impact rookie, either at third base or first. Noelvi Marte 's midseason transition to right field was pretty seamless, although his bat went away in September (.191, 32 strikeouts, three walks) after he hit well in July and August. They'll certainly need more power production from Elly De La Cruz , who finished with 22 home runs after somehow hitting only one in a 74-game stretch over the summer. Playing in the same division as the Brewers and Chicago Cubs isn't an easy assignment, but if the young hitters can improve -- of course, we've been saying that about Cincinnati for the past decade -- to back up this rotation, the Reds can return to the postseason.",https://www.espn.com/mlb/story/_/id/46577513/mlb-2025-playoffs-real-not-mariners-ohtani-dodgers-blue-jays-phillies-judge,Sport,BBC,,https://a3.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2025%2F1014%2Fr1559878_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg,,e409261c4ed0d6657dd8d91e0fe584d4acd9c515
84e0efed4b1c,MLB,,"TORONTO -- Every so often in the Seattle Mariners clubhouse, the ""Top Gun Anthem,"" full of soaring guitar notes and pick-me-up vibes, will randomly blast from inside a locker. Everyone knows the culprit. Jorge Polanco , the Mariners' veteran second baseman, is not a fan of silencing his phone. ""But he loves Maverick and Iceman,"" Mariners star Cal Raleigh said. Nobody really minds. When a player is doing what Polanco has done this postseason -- rescuing the Mariners from the danger zone seemingly daily, with his latest trick a go-ahead three-run home run that paved the way for Monday's 10-3 victory -- his ringtone could be Limp Bizkit and nobody would utter a peep. Instead, it's the perfect soundtrack for this Mariners run, which currently sees them up two games to none against the Toronto Blue Jays in the American League Championship Series. The ""Top Gun Anthem"" is an epic ballad filled with the sorts of ups and downs that personify an organization that has spent 49 years alternating among the desolation of mediocrity and the heartbreak of underachievement. The only team in Major League Baseball to never to play in a World Series, Seattle is two wins away from capturing its first American League pennant and is heading home to T-Mobile Park for Game 3. The Mariners' dominant position is in large part thanks to a 32-year-old infielder whose feats have earned him the right to be called Iceman himself -- and yet that's not the nickname Polanco wears these days. ""He's George Bonds,"" M's catcher Mitch Garver said. Yes, Polanco's alter ego is the anglicized version of his first name and the surname of Major League Baseball's all-time home run leader. He earned it earlier this season, Garver said, when ""everything he hit was 110 [mph] in a gap or over the fence. It was unbelievable."" The Big Dumper ... and some magic? Seattle has never won a World Series. Or even an American League pennant. Could a little bit of alchemy change that? Alden Gonzalez » Particularly when considering that last winter, Polanco didn't know whether he would be healthy enough to keep hitting major league pitching. Polanco, who had struggled for years with left knee issues, underwent surgery in October 2024 to repair his patellar tendon. A free agent, Polanco drew limited interest on the market and wound up re-signing with the Mariners for one year and $7.75 million. ""It's been a journey, man,"" Polanco said. ""That's the way I can put it. I wouldn't say it's been bad. I wouldn't say it's been easy. I think God just prepared me for this year. I've been hurt a little bit, so yeah; but now we here, and I'm glad to be back. ""You just have to have faith. You overcome. Come back stronger."" Polanco's strength has been on display all October. It first appeared in the second game of Seattle's division series against the Detroit Tigers when he hit two home runs off ace Tarik Skubal , who is about to win his second consecutive Cy Young Award. It continued three games later in a winner-takes-all Game 5 when he lashed a single into right field in the 15th inning that advanced the Mariners to their first ALCS since 2001. It didn't stop there, with Polanco's go-ahead single in the sixth inning of Game 1 against the Blue Jays on Sunday. MLB playoff tracker: Who can clinch next? From current playoff matchups to league races to the postseason schedule, we've got you covered. Everything to know » Then came Monday's fifth-inning blast off Toronto reliever Louis Varland , who fed a 98 mph fastball over the plate and watched it leave the bat at 105.2 mph, flying 400 feet to turn a 3-3 tie into a 6-3 Seattle lead. ""He's always been a great hitter,"" Mariners manager Dan Wilson said. ""His swing right now is very short. That ball tonight, I wasn't sure it was going to go out of the ballpark, but I think he's just getting that kind of spin on it right now where it stays up."" That is no accident. Polanco arrived in the major leagues with the Minnesota Twins in 2014 at age 20, a bat-to-ball savant whose ability to hit from both sides of the plate carved him out a regular role with the team. ""He wasn't George Bonds before,"" Garver said. ""He was Harry Potter. Because he was a wizard. He'd just make hits appear."" Polanco found power five years into his career, and he maxed out with 33 home runs for the Twins in 2021. But the degradation of his knee sapped the juice in his bat and left him flailing too often at pitches he'd have previously spit on. Last year, in his first season with the Mariners, his numbers cratered, but the organization appreciated Polanco's even-keeled demeanor and believed fixing his knee would fix his swing too. The Mariners were right. George Bonds was born during a ridiculous first month of the 2025 season when he whacked nine homers in 80 plate appearances. Polanco had embraced the M's ethos of pulling the ball in the air. Raleigh led MLB with a 1.594 OPS on balls pulled. Third baseman Eugenio Suarez was second at 1.497. Polanco hit 23 of his 26 home runs this season to the pull side, and both of his homers off Skubal (hit from the right side) and the one against Varland (left) were met in front of the plate and yanked over the fence.

Sign Up Now ""Throughout the years, I hated going to Minnesota just solely because of him,"" said shortstop J.P. Crawford , the longest-tenured Mariner. ""The guy single-handedly beat us so many times. We all know the type of player he is when he is healthy, and it's clearly showing right now."" Never in the game's 150-year history had a player logged three consecutive game-winning hits in the fifth inning or later during the postseason. It's the sort of performance teams need to win pennants -- and championships. As brilliant as Raleigh has been in a could-be-MVP campaign and as conflagrant as Julio Rodriguez was in the second half and as dominant as Seattle's pitching has been en route to this point, winning playoff baseball takes more. Like, say, a guy who over the winter was an afterthought now hitting cleanup and never wavering, even in the highest-leverage situations. ""What's most impressive is bouncing back after a rough year last year,"" said Seattle pitcher Bryan Woo , who is lined up to start a potential Game 5 on Friday. ""Especially for a guy on his second team, back half of his career. To do what he's doing -- get healthy, come back, help the team like he has -- is even more impressive than just playing good baseball."" Playing good baseball helps too. Polanco has helped get Seattle in a place that barely a month ago looked impossible to conceive. From mid-August to early September, the Mariners lost 13 of 18, trailed the Houston Astros by 3½ games in the AL West and held a half-game lead on the Texas Rangers for the final wild-card spot. From there, the M's went 17-4, won the West, earned a first-round bye and charted a course for history. They're not there. And yet even Polanco admitted that Seattle players can't ignore the team's history and recognize what it would mean to get to the World Series. ""Yeah, we think about it,"" he said. ""We've heard it a lot. We know."" The knowledge hasn't deterred them. Raleigh is raking. Rodriguez is slugging. Josh Naylor , who grew up in nearby Mississauga, Ontario, blasted a two-run home run in Game 2 of the ALCS. And George Bonds has shown up in style, cold as Iceman, cool as Maverick, perfectly happy to eschew silent mode in favor of loud contact.",https://www.espn.com/mlb/story/_/id/46587262/mlb-2025-playoffs-jorge-polanco-seattle-mariners-alcs-game-2,Sport,BBC,,https://a2.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2025%2F1014%2Fr1559813_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg,,dcf4e1b81c827343d6750a737d86ccdbffcf2478

The New Caledonia forward has just scored the second goal in his country's 2-0 friendly win against Gibraltar, though he knows he has a long night ahead of him. A bus will collect him and his domestic teammates at 2.30 a.m. to begin a 30-hour, 12,000-mile journey home -- just 72 hours after making it in the opposite direction to play their Oct. 8 friendly. Haewegene is standing outside the visitors locker room in Gibraltar's Europa Point Stadium, holding an apple in his hand -- no protein shakes or rehydration gels for this group of players -- but he wants to talk about his goal, the pride of playing for the South Pacific nation and why even a grueling trip back to the French-controlled archipelago is absolutely nothing to complain about. ""It is a joy to play football and a big joy to score a goal, which I dedicate to my son and my wife,"" Haewegene told ESPN. ""I feel pride for my country and also for my teammates, who did a big job to win this game. ""Yes, we don't have a lot of time before we fly home, but we will prepare our suitcases and go to the airport early. It's no problem. It's the first time New Caledonia has played in Europe and we won, so we are really happy. We don't worry about the journey."" The players of New Caledonia celebrate on one of the team buses after their win in Gibraltar. Said goal scorer Germain Haewegene of their mission, 'Every young boy wants to play in a World Cup, it is a dream. It is our dream, and we know we have a chance.' Ben Roberts for ESPN New Caledonia's biggest journey has only just started and the final destination, as incredulous as it seems, could be the 2026 FIFA Men's World Cup in the United States, Mexico and Canada. Nicknamed "" Les Cagous "" after the indigenous flightless bird that inhabits the dozens of islands that form the country, New Caledonia secured their place in next March's FIFA interconfederation playoffs by reaching the final of the Oceania qualification campaign, where they lost 3-0 to New Zealand earlier this year. However, their semifinal win against Tahiti had already sealed the prize of a ticket to the playoffs. ""It is always special to beat Tahiti,"" midfielder Jekob Jeno said. ""They are our big rivals."" - Why this is (kinda) the last October international break ever - How Estêvão, 'Little Messi,' burst onto scene at Chelsea - Premier League issues: What to watch after break Tahiti and New Caledonia are separated by 2,900 miles of ocean, making it perhaps the longest-distance ""local"" rivalry in sport. But while New Zealand booked Oceania's solitary direct World Cup spot, New Caledonia will travel to Mexico for the interconfederation playoffs in Guadalajara and Monterrey knowing they're just two victories from the World Cup. They are a team consisting of part-timers playing in New Caledonia's 10-team Super Ligue and several who play no higher than the fifth-tier of French football. Only Jeno, who joined Romania 's Unirea Slobozia this summer, represents a top-level team beyond Oceania. Bolivia have also qualified for the Play-Offs and will be joined by two Concacaf nations and one each from Asia and Africa; New Caledonia, ranked 150 by FIFA, know they have a mountain to climb to become the smallest nation ever, eclipsing Iceland, to qualify for the World Cup by clinching one of the two final qualification spots. ""The step is big,"" coach Johann Sidaner told ESPN. ""Maybe we have a 1% chance of qualifying for the World Cup. But we will play 100% to do it."" (Top left) The New Caledonia team take part in a practice session at the Europa Point Stadium.

Ben Roberts for ESPN Their dream may be years in the making, but New Caledonia is a relative newcomer to international football, only becoming a member of FIFA in 2004 after being given permission by the French Football Federation four years earlier to apply for membership. As one of France 's Overseas Territories, its citizens have French nationality and are eligible to vote in French presidential elections. Despite being over 10,000 miles apart, the close ties to France explain why almost half of Sidaner's squad play in the country and why the 48-year-old left a position at his hometown club Nantes to become New Caledonia coach in 2022. ""It was an easy decision for me,"" Sidaner said. ""The culture of the people is welcoming, friendly and they love football. It is easy to manage this football team."" AS Magenta, the reigning champions of the New Caledonia Super Ligue, will play in this season's Coupe de France and have already been assigned a home draw in the seventh round in November -- the same stage that teams from Ligue 2 enter the competition -- so the fans of Saint-Etienne, Nancy or Montpellier could face an epic road trip. However, the French connection can be problematic. When Gibraltar confirmed the friendly against New Caledonia last month, the announcement was done with flags from Gibraltar and New Caledonia alongside each other on the Gibraltar FA website, causing little short of a diplomatic incident. ""We were asked by UEFA within 20 minutes of the story going up to change the flag [and add France] because of a complaint by New Caledonia,"" a Gibraltar source told ESPN.

Watch your favorite events in the newly enhanced ESPN App. Learn more about what plan is right for you. Sign Up Now The flag sensitivity also led to Gibraltar having to buy a new flagpole for the game due to both French and New Caledonian flags needing to be flown, with strict instructions that the French flag took prominence over the island nation's. It was only in 2008 that France granted the football team permission to have its own anthem rather than La Marseillaise , which remains New Caledonia's official national anthem, so it is against this backdrop of French control that New Caledonia's footballers are literally putting their country on the map. ""Maybe we can show ourselves as New Caledonia through our football,"" midfielder Jeno said. ""Our football is not professional, but it's football and each year, we are developing. ""We know how important the team is to people in New Caledonia. We are their passion and our progress is good for everybody. I am fortunate: I have a career in Europe and a good contract in Romania, but the guys back home, they work in their jobs, they go to work in the morning and they train at night. ""They have had to take time away from their families, their jobs -- normal jobs, like working in a supermarket -- to come to Gibraltar, but we all do it for New Caledonia."" Haewegene, the charismatic goal scorer, laughs when asked whether he could be a full-time professional in New Caledonia with AS Magenta, before revealing his incredible ""real"" job. ""Professional? Ha ha, no!"" Haewegene said. ""I play for the biggest team in New Caledonia, but we are not professional. My job is a Paralympic coach -- I am a guide for blind or visually impaired sprinters. I went to the Paralympics last year to help the French athletes. I can run 100 meters in 11.3 seconds: I'm fast. Very fast!"" (Top left) New Caledonia men's football captain, César Zeoula.

(Bottom left) On the night before their friendly match with Gibraltar, members of the New Caledonia team try to unwind after a long journey, playing video games at their hotel. (Bottom right) The team arrive at the Europa Point Stadium. Ben Roberts for ESPN So how does a national team from the South Pacific, a country 1,200 miles east of Sydney, Australia, end up playing one of Europe's smallest nations in a friendly game anyway? It's a game that pitches the 200th best team in the world (Gibraltar) against one ranked just 50 places higher. Gibraltar's stadium is half-football ground and half-cricket pitch, tightly framed by the imposing Rock of Gibraltar, a substantial red-and-white lighthouse and the Straits of Gibraltar, the 9-mile-wide stretch of water that separates Europe from Africa. But having not played a game since the defeat against New Zealand in Auckland in March, New Caledonia simply needed to play. ""My job is to arrange games for national teams and the New Caledonia coach asked me to find an opponent in Europe in October,"" Gaël Mahé, a FIFA match agent told ESPN. ""But it's not easy. There aren't many possibilities, especially because there are World Cup qualifiers right now and the big national teams can find opponents much easier. ""For the New Caledonia players, half of whom play in their own country, they are travelling halfway around the world for 30 hours, but Gibraltar were happy to play the game, so it was a good solution."" It's 4 a.m. in Noumea, the capital of New Caledonia, when Sidaner's team kick off against Gibraltar at 7 p.m. local time. Having only arrived on Sunday evening, the jet lag is likely to be at its most punishing for the home-based players. A team room with table tennis and video games has been set up at the squad's hotel; some players spend their time shopping, while coach Sidaner relaxes on the terrace outside the hotel with a beer. There is a relaxed atmosphere around the team, but once the game starts, there is also a tenacity and energy that takes Gibraltar by surprise. New Caledonia are quick and lively and they deserve their victory with second-half goals from Jean-Jacques Katrawa and Haewegene. At top, New Caledonia footballer Jean-Jacques Katrawa (#9, center) attacks the Gibraltar goal in the second half. At bottom, New Caledonia players prepare to defend a Gibraltar corner. Ben Roberts for ESPN ""It was an important victory for us because we have beaten a European team for the first time,"" coach Sidaner said. ""We haven't played together for a long time, so this will be a very big step for our plans for the Play-Offs. ""We are raising the level of demand with these World Cup 2026 qualifying play-offs and we are only 150 days away from a historic date for New Caledonian football. But for this kind of result, this kind of performance, this is why I chose to coach New Caledonia. For these special moments."" A training camp in France is planned for January, with hopes of at least one competitive game before the trip to Mexico in March, but after beating Gibraltar, the players just want to celebrate the moment. Sidaner's squad sit on the steps outside the stadium post-game; some are on their phones, a couple of them sneak a vape and others pose for selfies and photographs. Then they get on the bus, pack their bags and prepare for that arduous journey home. The itinerary takes them from Malaga, Spain, to Paris, a connecting flight to Singapore and then finally to Noumea -- all in coach class -- but there is only joy among the players as they danced on the bus. ""Every young boy wants to play in a World Cup -- it is a dream,"" Haewegene said. ""That is our dream, and we know we have a chance.""",https://www.espn.com/soccer/story/_/id/46581658/fifa-world-cup-new-caledonia-qualification-gibraltar-mark-ogden,Sport,BBC,,https://a2.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2025%2F1010%2Fr1558435_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg,,5b5d401033fb5d250b85a0052dec2b62f0fa5271
11f50607a0c1,"2026 World Cup: Who has qualified, and how the rest can make it",,"Qualifying for the 2026 FIFA World Cup began on Oct. 12, 2023, when countries from the Asian confederation played their first round of matches. Myanmar's Lwin Moe Aung scored the very first goal in a 5-1 win over Macau. All confederations are drawing to a close, but we're still a long way from discovering the full list of 45 nations that will join hosts United States , Mexico and Canada to make up the field of 48. Japan were the very first country to qualify on March 20. QUALIFIED (25/45): Japan, New Zealand, Iran, Argentina, Uzbekistan, South Korea, Jordan, Australia, Brazil, Ecuador, Uruguay, Colombia, Paraguay, Morocco, Tunisia, Egypt, Algeria, Ghana, Cape Verde, South Africa, Qatar, England, Saudi Arabia, Ivory Coast, Senegal What was decided in October? Europe and Concacaf: Qualifying doesn't end until November, but we did see England become the first European country to book their place. Africa: The final two rounds of the group stage were played, when we discovered the seven nations that joined Morocco and Tunisia, plus the interconfederation playoff contenders. Asia: The fourth round was played, when we will found out the final two automatic qualifiers, along with the two interconfederation playoff contenders. South America and Oceania: Qualification complete. There were 54 FIFA-affiliated nations in the draw. However, Eritrea subsequently withdrew. Round 1: The teams were in eight groups of six nations, and one group of five (with Eritrea removed). The nine group winners qualified for the World Cup. This stage began in November 2023 and was completed in October 2025. QUALIFIED (9/9): Morocco, Tunisia, Egypt, Algeria, Ghana, Cape Verde, South Africa, Ivory Coast, Senegal World Cup groups - Africa Group A Egypt Burkina Faso Guinea-Bissau Sierra Leone Ethiopia Djibouti Group B Senegal DR Congo Mauritania Togo Sudan South Sudan Group C Nigeria South Africa Benin Zimbabwe Rwanda Lesotho Group D Cameroon Cape Verde Angola Libya Eswatini Mauritius Group E Morocco Zambia Congo Tanzania Niger Eritrea Group F Ivory Coast Gabon Kenya Gambia Burundi Seychelles Group G Algeria Guinea Uganda Mozambique Botswana Somalia Group H Tunisia Equatorial Guinea Namibia Malawi Liberia São Tomé Group I Mali Ghana Madagascar Cent African Rep Comoros Chad How teams qualified as the group stage ended TUESDAY Group B: SENEGAL (24) beat Mauritania (7) 4-0 to qualify. Second-placed DR Congo (22) beat Sudan (13) 1-0 and take a playoff place. Group C: Benin (17, +1) had qualification in their own hands, but lost 4-0 in Nigeria (17, +7). That enabled SOUTH AFRICA (18) to qualify for the World Cup with a 3-0 win at home to Rwanda (11). Nigeria finished second and scored their fourth in the final minute, a goal which guaranteed a place in the playoffs. South Africa celebrate during their win over Rwanda. AP Photo/Themba Hadebe Group F: IVORY COAST (26) beat Kenya (12) 3-0 to confirm their place at the World Cup. Gabon (25) have to settle for a playoff route. Group G: ALGERIA (25) qualified with a 3-0 win over Somalia (1) on Thursday. Uganda (18) took second place despite a late 2-1 defeat in Algeria on Tuesday, but it's not good enough for a playoff. MONDAY Group D: CAPE VERDE (23) eased to a debut World Cup appearance by winning 3-0 at home to Eswatini (3) on Monday. Cameroon could only draw 0-0 at home to Angola, but they are through to round two in November.

Cristiano Barbosa/Sportsfile via Getty Images Group H: TUNISIA (28) have qualified. Namibia (15) took second place but they have the worst record of all the runners-up and will not be in the playoffs. SUNDAY Group A: EGYPT (23) qualified with a 3-0 win over rock-bottom Djibouti (1) on Wednesday, on the back of two goals from Mohamed Salah. On Sunday, Burkina Faso (21) put themselves in with a strong chance of one of the playoff spots with a 3-1 win over Ethiopia but, due to Nigeria's 4-0 win, they will be out if DR Congo beat Sudan and Senegal win or draw. Egypt became the third African nation to qualify for the 2026 World Cup on Wednesday. ABDEL MAJID BZIOUAT/AFP via Getty Images Group E: MOROCCO (21) have qualified. Niger (15) confirmed second place by winning in Zambia on Sunday, but they won't get a playoff. Group I: GHANA (25) won 1-0 at home to Comoros (15) to become the 18th team to qualify. Madagascar (19) suffered a damaging 4-1 defeat to Mali (15), and they are now out of contention for a best runners-up spot.

This stage will be played on neutral ground in Morocco in November 2025. The fixtures will be created using the FIFA World Ranking released at the end of October, but the order will not change so we know the fixtures now. The highest rank will play the lowest rank, and second faced third. The winners of those two ties will then meet to move on to the March playoffs. Nigeria (current World Ranking 45) vs. Gabon (79) Cameroon (52) vs. DR Congo (60) There are 55 European nations, although 54 will compete as Russia remain suspended due to the invasion of Ukraine. There are 12 groups of four or five teams, playing home and away matches. The group stage qualifying process ends with a double-header in November. World Cup groups - UEFA Group A Germany Slovakia N Ireland Luxembourg - Group B Switzerland Sweden Slovenia Kosovo - Group C Denmark Greece Scotland Belarus - Group D France Ukraine Iceland Azerbaijan - Group E Spain Turkey Georgia Bulgaria - Group F Portugal Hungary Rep of Ireland Armenia - Group G Netherlands Poland Finland Lithuania Malta Group H Austria Romania Bosnia Cyrpus San Marino Group I Italy Norway Israel Estonia Moldova Group J Belgium Wales N Macedonia Kazakhstan Liechtenstein Group K England Serbia Albania Latvia Andorra Group L Croatia Czechia Montenegro Faroes Gibraltar The 12 group winners will qualify directly for the World Cup, with the 12 runners-up entering the playoff system. Qualifying began in March 2025 when most of the European teams who were not in UEFA Nations League (UNL) action played their first matches. QUALIFIED (1/12): England What happened in October? The teams that were in the UNL finals only played their first games in September so we're still a way off from discovering all the qualifiers. TUESDAY Group E: Spain (12) are top with a 100% record with Turkey (9) the nearest challengers. Spain have a goal difference advantage of 12 over Turkey, so they will qualify in all but name with a win in Georgia (3) on Nov. 15 (and it will be certain if Turkey do not win at home to Bulgaria). Turkey look set for the playoffs, while Bulgaria (0) are out. Group F: Portugal (10) are close to qualification but a late Hungary (5) equaliser in Lisbon on Tuesday means they must wait until November to seal it. A win in Republic of Ireland (4) on Nov. 13 seals it for Portugal, but the Irish need results in the race for second place. On the same day it's Armenia (3) vs. Hungary, with the away team able to seal second place with a win if Ireland lose to Portugal. On the final day on Nov. 16, it's Hungary vs. Ireland and Portugal vs. Armenia. Cristiano Ronaldo and Portugal could qualify for the World Cup this week. Hrach Khachatryan/ MB Media/Getty Images Group I: Norway (18) are in control ahead of Italy (15) but it's Norway's vastly superior goal difference (+26 vs. +10) which means a win at home to Estonia (4) on Nov. 13 should effectively do the job for Norway, even if Italy win away to Moldova (1) that day. On the final day, it's Italy vs. Norway; if Norway go into it three points ahead Italy would need a huge win to avoid the playoffs. Group K: ENGLAND (18) have dominated the group, qualifying with a 100% record without conceding a goal. It was sealed with a 5-0 win in Latvia on Tuesday. Albania (11) hold the playoff place over Serbia (10), and both play England in November. As Albania's other game is vs. Andorra (1) they are favourites to finish second. MONDAY Group A: Germany (9, +5) and Slovakia (9, +3) are in the box seat, and Northern Ireland (6, +1) will surely have to win in Slovakia on Nov. 14 to stay in contention. The final group game between Germany and Slovakia in Leipzig on Nov. 17 looks like being the decider, though. If Northern Ireland miss out on the top two, they are almost certain to get a playoff through the Nations League route. Luxembourg (0) are out. Group B: Switzerland (10, +9) hold a lead over Kosovo (7, -1) and their goal difference is worth an extra point. In effect, it means the Swiss will have qualified in all but name if they win at home to Sweden (1) on Nov. 15. If they don't, it could open the door to Kosovo, who are away to Slovenia (3) before hosting Switzerland on Nov. 18. Slovenia must beat Kosovo to keep alive their hopes of a playoff. Sweden are all but out of it but are set to get a playoff route through the Nations League. Group D: France (10, +6) still have work to do to hold off Ukraine (7, +1) in second. On Nov. 13, it's France vs. Ukraine and Les Bleus will qualify with a victory. Even if France lose, goal difference means they are in strong position with a home game against Azerbaijan (1, -9) to finish up on Nov. 16. Iceland (4, +2) will hope that France get the win, as if they beat Azerbaijan they will move into the playoff place on goal difference. And that sets up a huge final day-game between Ukraine and Iceland in Warsaw. Azerbaijan have only a mathematical chance of a playoff. Group J: Belgium (14, +15), who moved back to the top of the table with a 4-2 win in Wales on Monday, finish up against two eliminated teams -- away to Kazakhstan (7) on Nov. 15 and at home to Liechtenstein (0). As North Macedonia have only one fixture to play, Belgium need three points to qualify, so they will do it by beating Kazakhstan -- though the game against Liechtenstein means it's effectively a formality. North Macedonia (13, +9) will look to hold off Wales (10, +3) for second. Wales go to Liechtenstein first up, before a huge game against North Macedonia in Cardiff. Wales need to win by six goals in the first game to go into the head to head in second on goal difference, which would mean a draw would be enough in the last game. While both North Macedonia and Wales are guaranteed a playoff route through the Nations League, finishing in second gives a better seeding -- and for Wales a home semifinal. SUNDAY Group C: Denmark (10, +11) and Scotland (10, +5) are the only two teams left in contention. On Nov. 15, it's Denmark vs. Belarus so Scotland will surely have to win in Greece to stay in the hunt for automatic qualification. If that does happen, the group is set up for a decider between Scotland and Denmark in Glasgow on Nov. 18; that looks like being must-win for Scotland as their goal difference is not as good. Greece and Belarus are eliminated. Group G: Netherlands (16, +19) sit top ahead of Poland (13, +4), who do still have to host Netherlands on Nov. 14 but their goal difference is 13 worse right now -- so the Dutch know they can afford to lose that and as long as they win at home to Lithuania (3) on Nov. 17 they'll still top the group. With a game in hand on Finland (10, -5) and far superior goal difference, it looks like Poland will be in the playoffs. Lithuania and Malta are out. Group H: A surprise win for Romania (10) at home to Austria (15) has reignited the group, but Austria remain favourites to top it. Nov. 15: Austria will qualify with a win in Cyprus (8) if Bosnia and Herzegovina (13) lose at home to Romania, who must at least avoid defeat to stay in contention for a playoff spot (though they will get a route as a UEFA Nations League group winner regardless). Romania finish up at home to San Marino, so if they can beat Bosnia they will be odds-on to finish at least second, and that would benefit San Marino through the Nations League route. Nov. 18: If Bosnia and Austria both win (or results to keep the two teams in touch), then they meet each other in Vienna to decide who qualifies automatically. Cyprus are out and San Marino have only slim hope of a playoff through the Nations League route. Group L: Croatia (16, +19) now look locked for the World Cup and need just one point from games in November at home to Faroe Islands (12) and away to Montenegro (6). Even if they lost both matches, their goal difference is far better than that of Czechia (13, +4). A shock win for the Faroes at home to Czechia on Sunday is unlikely to mean they can gatecrash the playoff place, because Czechia's last remaining game is at home to Gibraltar on Nov. 17. Faroe Islands are away to Croatia on Nov. 14, and Czechia will be assured of second if the Faroes lose. Montenegro and Gibraltar are eliminated. - Check out the latest fixtures and results here | Tables PLAYOFFS The final four places at the World Cup will be determined via the UEFA playoffs, to be played in March 2026. There is no path to the World Cup through FIFA's interconfederation playoffs. The UEFA playoffs involve 16 teams: the 12 group stage runners-up plus the four best-ranked group winners from the UNL, who did not finish in the top two in World Cup qualifying. This creates four routes, each with four teams featuring a one-legged semifinal and a final for a place at the World Cup. The priority order for the four World Cup playoff places through the UNL is: Spain, Germany, Portugal, France, England, Norway, Wales, Czechia, Romania, Sweden, North Macedonia, Northern Ireland, Moldova, San Marino. Of the 14 teams to win their UNL groups, 10 of those were in Pot 1 or 2 for the World Cup qualifying draw -- so on ranking would finish in the top two of their group. If that comes to pass, North Macedonia, Northern Ireland, Moldova and San Marino would get a playoff place. However, that now appears unlikely with Romania and Sweden struggling to finish in the top two. Seeding: Pot 1: Four World Cup qualifying group runners-up with the best FIFA World Ranking Pot 2: As above, teams fifth to eighth in the FIFA World Ranking list order Pot 3: As above, teams ninth to 12th in the FIFA World Ranking list order Pot 4: UEFA Nations League teams Semifinals: Pot 1 vs. Pot 4 Pot 2 vs. Pot 3 The World Cup Trophy on display in New York during the official Trophy Tour around host cities. Mike Stobe - FIFA/FIFA via Getty Images The Socceroos qualified for the World Cup with a 2-1 win over Saudi Arabia on Tuesday. Photo by Robert Cianflone/Getty Images This is by some distance the most complicated route to the World Cup, with a layered qualifying process featuring a dual group stage to find the eight automatic qualifiers. But the main part is now done and dusted. Round 1: The 20 lowest-ranked nations played two-legged ties in October 2023. Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Chinese Taipei, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Myanmar, Nepal, Pakistan, Singapore and Yemen advanced. Round 2: Those 10 winners joined the 26 best-ranked nations. The 36 teams were drawn into nine groups of four teams, with the top two nations going through to Round 3. This stage began in November 2023 and was completed in June 2024. - Final tables Advanced: Australia, Bahrain, China, Indonesia, Iran, Iraq, Japan, Jordan, Kuwait, Kyrgyz Republic, North Korea, Oman, Palestine, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, South Korea, United Arab Emirates, Uzbekistan Round 3: We were left with 18 nations, drawn into three groups of six teams. Matches began in September 2024 and the round is completed on Tuesday. The group winners and runners-up took the first six places at the 2026 World Cup and their campaign is complete. Japan became the first team to qualify for the World Cup on March 20, followed by Iran , Jordan , South Korea , Uzbekistan and Australia . - Check out the results | Final tables Round 4: The six teams in this stage were drawn into two groups of three. They will play each other once, so two matches in total per team, in one host country in October. QUALIFIED (8/8): Japan, Iran, Uzbekistan, South Korea, Jordan, Australia, Qatar, Saudi Arabia What was decided in October? We found out the final two automatic qualifiers, plus the teams that will battle it out for a playoff in round five. Group A: Qatar (hosts), United Arab Emirates, Oman Wednesday: Oman 0-0 Qatar Saturday: United Arab Emirates 2-1 Oman Tuesday: Qatar 2-1 United Arab Emirates Qatar won the final group game 2-1 and qualified for the World Cup, while UAE are in the playoff. Group B: Saudi Arabia (hosts), Iraq, Indonesia Wednesday: Indonesia 2-3 Saudi Arabia Saturday: Iraq 1-0 Indonesia Tuesday: Saudi Arabia 0-0 Iraq A goalless draw meant the two hosts of the playoffs both qualified, Iraq move into the playoffs. Round 5: A two-legged tie in November 2025 to earn the place in the interconfederation playoffs. UAE will play Saudi Arabia. Usually, Concacaf would have six automatic places in qualifying -- but for the 2026 finals three of the six are taken up by the hosts. That leaves three places to be won, plus two spots in the interconfederation playoff path. Concacaf saw 32 nations enter the race to make the finals. Round 1: The four lowest-ranked Concacaf nations battled it out in two-legged ties. Anguilla and British Virgin Islands eliminated Turks and Caicos Islands and U.S. Virgin Islands respectively, both on penalties. Round 2: The top 28-ranked nations, plus the two winners from Round 1, were drawn into six groups of five teams. Teams played each other only once, rather than home and away. This stage was played in two blocks, in June 2024 and June 2025. The six group winners and six group runners-up moved on to Round 3. Advanced: Bermuda, Costa Rica, Curaçao, El Salvador, Guatemala, Haiti, Honduras, Jamaica, Nicaragua, Panama, Suriname, Trinidad and Tobago Round 3: The 12 remaining teams were drawn into three groups of four teams. This phase started in September and will be completed in October and November. The group winners will qualify for the World Cup, with the two runners-up with the best record going on to take part in the interconfederation playoffs. - Check out the fixtures and results | Latest tables QUALIFIED (0/3): What can be decided in October? Group A: Suriname (5) sit in first place, but a 1-1 draw at home to Guatemala (2) on Friday could be damaging. Panama (5) moved level at the top by beating El Salvador (3) 1-0. On Tuesday, it's Panama vs. Suriname as the top two meet, and El Salvador vs Guatemala. Group B: Curaçao's (7) 2-0 win over Jamaica (6) on Friday put them in the box seat for a first-ever World Cup appearance. On Tuesday, Curaçao are to home to Trinidad and Tobago (4), who can't afford to lose if they are to stay in contention for an automatic place. The other game sees Jamaica host Bermuda (0). Group C: Honduras (8) are in a good position after they beat Haiti (5) on Monday. The nearest challengers are Costa Rica (6), who thrashed Nicaragua (1). Nov. 13 sees Honduras go to Nicaragua, and a win will send them to the World Cup if Haiti vs. Costa Rica is a draw. On the final day on Nov. 18 it's Costa Rica vs. Honduras, which could yet be a decider for the automatic qualification place. As in recent qualifying competitions, all 10 nations played each other home and away. The top six nations qualified directly to the finals. The seventh-placed team goes into the interconfederation playoffs in March. The first qualifiers took place in September 2023, with the league phase completed in September 2025.

6309b74a56fe,NBA,,"EXACTLY ONE HOUR before the tipoff of the gold medal game last summer in Paris, when Olympic rules dictated players could come onto the court for warmups, an unlikely duo was the first to hit the floor. Erik Spoelstra and LeBron James , all business, worked through their pregame routine, Team USA's assistant coach putting the player through the paces. It was a common sight all summer, Spoelstra and James working together individually, their past history of joy, pain and drama with the Miami Heat pushed out of consciousness. ""Moments like those are a testament to what USA Basketball is all about,"" Spoelstra told ESPN. ""No matter what friction or misunderstandings you may have had in the NBA, it all gets moved aside because you have the same goal."" Spoelstra is known for his obsessive nature, but especially so when it comes to what he refers to as the ""purity"" of competition. Whether he's talking about a bench player filling his role, a superstar delivering in the clutch or his own responsibilities, it's one of the guiding principles in Spoelstra's 17 years as head coach of the Heat. And it's why Spoelstra has been destined to lead Team USA, which was formalized Tuesday when he was announced as the next head coach of the national team. Spoelstra will guide the Americans through the 2027 FIBA World Cup in Qatar and the 2028 Olympics in Los Angeles. ""Everyone in this business wants to be a part of Team USA, the legacy and history of the program is the ultimate in the sport and I'm both humbled and grateful,"" Spoelstra said. ""Competing on the world stage is so stimulating."" SPOELSTRA HAS QUICKLY moved up the USA Basketball ranks, coaching the Select Team in 2021 during a COVID-limited training camp in Las Vegas that helped prepare the national team for the Tokyo games that summer. Then he was former coach Steve Kerr's assistant for the 2023 World Cup and 2024 Olympics, impressing USA Basketball executive director Grant Hill so much with his investment in the role that he instantly became the leading candidate to be Kerr's successor. ""Just watching him the last two summers and getting to know him up close rather than just from afar, where I've admired him for so long, I got a firsthand glimpse at what a great coach he is,"" Kerr said last week. ""I think the assistant coaching [on Team USA] is almost a prerequisite for coaching USA ... he's a perfect choice. He's going to be great."" Hill, who took over USA Basketball in 2021, didn't run an expansive search, sources said. After seeing Spoelstra's performance, Hill and other members of the USA Basketball leadership team, including CEO Jim Tooley and Chairman Gen. (Ret.) Martin Dempsey, were convinced. ""I have known Erik Spoelstra for the better part of two decades and have gotten to know him better throughout our time with USA Basketball,"" Hill said. ""Spo is not only an outstanding coach, but a great colleague, friend and father, all of which make him the perfect choice to continue the USA Basketball Men's National Team coaching legacy through 2028."" Spoelstra has a significant task ahead of him -- both in selecting and preparing the team to defend its home turf and its gold medal. The superstars who powered the 2024 team in Paris -- Olympics MVP LeBron James, gold-medal-game hero Stephen Curry and four-time gold medalist Kevin Durant -- are obviously no guarantee to participate in LA28. In addition to turning over the roster, getting players to sign up for the World Cup in '27 might be a challenge. The World Cup is the primary way teams qualify for the Olympics and it's a grueling three-year process. It includes six qualification game windows over a 15-month span -- most of them played during the NBA season when top players aren't available and many game are in far-flung places such as Santa Cruz do Sul, Brazil -- that must be navigated to qualify for the World Cup. Then only the top two finishers from North and South America at the World Cup itself get into the Olympics. The U.S. has squeaked into Olympic berths over the past two cycles, not medaling in the previous two World Cups. But because the U.S. is the host nation, the Americans are given an automatic berth into 2028. With the summer heat in Doha (the World Cup starts Aug. 27, 2027), getting participation from top stars -- with an Olympic berth already guaranteed -- could be a harder sell. Other countries, such as the reigning World Cup and European champion Germany, have required players to make multiyear commitments to ensure they make the Olympic roster. Team USA created this standard in 2005 after losing the 2004 Olympic gold but has moved away from it over the past 15 years. Hill and Spoelstra do not currently have plans for such a requirement, but the coach made it clear there will be a standard. ""This is a time where players are going to understand the importance of putting your hand up and saying you want the opportunity to be a part of the USA program,"" Spoelstra said. ""It's more than just about having to qualify [for the Olympics], it's about the shared life experience that being on Team USA means."" Managing high-profile stars, their egos and their needs is one of the demanding parts of the job. In 2024, for example, Kerr faced scrutiny when he elected to take Celtics star Jayson Tatum out of the rotation for two games. Team USA won them both, but Kerr was still heartily booed when he brought the Warriors to Boston last season, and probably will continue to be into the future. MIKE KRZYZEWSKI, GREGG POPOVICH and Kerr, the past three men in the job who have led Team USA to five straight Olympic golds, have all discussed the demanding nature of the decisions the job requires and the stress it induces. ""There's only one outcome that you are allowed to have -- it's did you win?"" Krzyzewski said last year looking back at his time as USA head coach from 2006-2018. ""To win the Olympic gold, you have to win what is essentially three straight Game 7s against NBA talent playing the biggest games of their lives, and you're expected to win them all."" And never more so than now. The U.S. is expected to win in 2028, but it no longer enjoys the large margin for error against international competition that it used to. The team has had to pull off double-digit comebacks in the medal round of the past two Olympics, the Game 7-style situations Krzyzewski referred to, to keep the gold streak alive. Spoelstra, who won two NBA championships as head coach and has led teams to the Finals six times, is well aware of the strings that come along with the promotion. ""When you're an assistant coach, it's easier for the players to see you as more of a friend, so the relationship changes [when you're head coach],"" Spoelstra said. ""But that is what you understand when you are a part of Team USA, you're the 'Man in the Arena,' and it really makes you feel alive.""",https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/46593132/erik-spoelstra-team-usa-coaching-nod-makes-feel-alive,Sport,BBC,,https://a4.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2025%2F1014%2Fr1560016_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg,,ab9a0f65f5f95052d06eca5d56c400911f15ee6b
8a2103da1352,ESPN,,"RULES ESPN's Bracketology efforts are focused on projecting the NCAA tournament field just as we expect the NCAA Division I basketball committee to select the field in March. ESPN bracketologist Joe Lunardi uses the same data points favored by the committee, including strength of schedule and other season-long indicators, including the NET and team-sheet data similar to what is available to the NCAA, in his projections of the field. Visit the NCAA's website for a fuller understanding of NCAA selection criteria . 68-Team Bracket The 68-team bracket is the standard version of the NCAA tournament field that has been in place since 2011. If the 2021 field is comprised of 68 teams, there will be some key differences to past years, however. The primary adjustment from a normal year is, of course, the playing of the entire NCAA tournament at a single site. This eliminates the need for geographical considerations in seeding. Additionally, there will be at least one fewer automatic qualifier this season, as the Ivy League's decision to forgo the 2020-21 season reduces the number of AQ entries to 31 for this season. 48-Team Bracket In this projection, a condensed selection process would reduce the field by 10 at-large teams and 10 automatic qualifiers (the latter of which still receive a revenue unit). The top four seeds in each region would receive a bye into the second round, with four first-round games per region - 5 vs. 12, 6 vs. 11, 7 vs. 10 and 8 vs. 9 - being played without fans on the higher seed's home court. To minimize travel, first-round pairings will be guided by geography to the greatest extent possible. And the reduced field results in only 32 teams competing at the central site. All participants must post a minimum .500 conference record - the ""Lunardi Rule"" - for at-large consideration. 16-Team Bracket In this projection, the committee selects and seeds the 16 best available teams. There are no automatic qualifiers, although all non-competing conference champions receive the designated revenue unit. To maintain some sense of national balance, conference participation is capped at four teams. And no region shall have more than one team from the same conference.",https://www.espn.com/espn/feature/story/_/page/bracketology/ncaa-bracketology-2026-march-madness-men-field-predictions,Sport,BBC,,https://a.espncdn.com/photo/2025/1014/r1559874_1296x729_16-9.jpg,,2fd04a16c4e682fea364970d1ce6124329a7c55c
d61f5296038c,NCAAM,,"​​ It's a new era of sorts in examining the nonconference portion of the men's college basketball season. A diminished slate of traditional MTEs -- exempt multiteam events -- along with ever-expanding league schedules have combined to change the cadence of marquee matchups, with games between high-majors and the top of the mid-major ranks becoming especially rare. Power conference challenges, outside the ACC/SEC event in December, have also faded away. The Players Era Festival and other one-off neutral court pairings have picked up some of the slack, but the Big East in recent years has done away with both the Gavitt Games (vs. Big Ten) as well as a mini-challenge against the Big 12. So, it is necessary to dig a little deeper for the most impactful and attractive nonconference games. That said, here's a full slate of ""can't miss"" encounters for the first month of the 2025-26 campaign. Nov. 3 | 7 p.m. ET | Hall of Fame Series | Las Vegas | TNT Defending national champion Florida has a solid chance at back-to-back titles -- on the heels of UConn's three-peat attempt last season. The Gators get a stiff test on opening night against an Arizona team coming off back-to-back Sweet 16 appearances. On our board, this is a battle between preseason No. 1 and No. 4 seeds. Until proven otherwise, Florida is the pick. play 0:16 Bryce James cashes a 3-pointer at Arizona showcase Bryce James knocks down a 3-pointer during a scrimmage at Arizona's showcase. Nov. 8 | Noon ET | New York | FS1 Why watch? Because it's Rick Pitino. Because it's Madison Square Garden. Because Alabama has recently been, and St. John's could be, a Final Four team. Because, because, because. We like the Red Storm holding serve in the Big Apple. Nov. 11 | 8 p.m. ET | Louisville | ESPN A true rivalry game in a true home court environment. Throw in a pair of top-11 teams and this should be a crackling affair. Both second-year coaches -- Mark Pope at Kentucky and Pat Kelsey at Louisville -- have engineered quick and sustainable success with their storied programs, winning 51 games in their combined debut with these programs. This looks like a true toss-up, with the winner staying in the hunt for an NCAA 1-seed. Nov. 13 | 7 p.m. ET | Tuscaloosa | ESPN2 Purdue, a legitimate preseason favorite to end the Big Ten's national title drought, has beaten Alabama both on neutral ground and at home the past two seasons. The Boilermakers figure to be a slight favorite in round three at Coleman Coliseum. But take the Tide in the upset and watch the Boilers fall off the top line of the bracket. Nov. 15 | 7 p.m. ET | Hall of Fame Series | Boston | FOX UConn's last national championship went through TD Garden in the East Region. BYU, with top freshman and Boston native AJ Dybantsa , might be too young for this spot. But the Cougars aren't at a talent deficit. Still, it's hard to go against Dan Hurley and the Huskies in Boston. play 2:10 AJ Dybantsa: Sweet 16 is the bare minimum goal for BYU AJ Dybantsa joins Skubie Mageza to discuss BYU, his favorite thing about Utah and his NBA comps. Nov. 17 | 7 p.m. ET | Raleigh | ACC Network This is my kind of game. Two likely NCAA tournament teams trying to build a nonleague résumé. Phil Martelli Jr. has quickly built a loaded Rams squad, and we know new Wolfpack coach Will Wade isn't messing around. We like VCU for the upset win, and the Atlantic 10 to return to multibid status in March. Nov. 18 | 9 p.m. ET | Champions Classic | New York | ESPN The Champions Classic returns to Madison Square Garden with two teams that have combined for an outrageous 27 No. 1 seeds in the past quarter century. The Jayhawks might be reloading a bit, but there is no such thing in Durham. Duke never ""unloads,"" and the Blue Devils should prevail in a colossal second game (Kentucky meets Michigan State in the opener). All of ESPN. All in one place.

Mike White got Georgia to the 2025 tournament in just his third year in Athens; Richard Pitino hopes for an even faster timeline as he takes over the Musketeers. I like Georgia in this one, even with last season's star freshman Asa Newell in the NBA. Nov. 24 | 5 p.m. ET | Maui Invitational | Lahaina | ESPN2 Opening in Maui are two more potential bubble teams. The Trojans went a disappointing 17-18 in Eric Musselman's first season, while the Broncos missed the dance last season after three straight appearances. Winning is important, obviously -- but so is advancing in the winner's bracket and drawing better opponents in rounds two and three. We like USC in this one. Nov. 25 | 6 p.m. ET | Players Era Festival | Las Vegas | TNT The preseason No. 2 Cougars get their biggest nonconference test at the Players Era event. The Vols, meanwhile, are looking to get past back-to-back Elite Eight appearances and reach the school's first Final Four. On this night, though, Houston will look much more like a national championship contender. Nov. 27 | 2 p.m. ET | Holiday Classic | Palm Springs | CBS Sports Network It says here that one of these teams will surprise and make the NCAA tournament. We like San Francisco to win this one in the desert, and challenge Gonzaga and Saint Mary's atop the West Coast Conference.

If the Buckeyes can return the favor in Pittsburgh -- which they should -- it would go a long way toward returning Ohio State to the tournament for the first time since 2022. Nov. 29 | 4:30 p.m. ET | Cathedral Classic | Philadelphia | ESPN+ These are two Philadelphia Big 5 teams picked near the bottom of their respective leagues. Doesn't matter. It's Year 99 of the fabled Palestra and this game is part of the Cathedral Classic, which also includes Hofstra and Merrimack. Beats Christmas shopping by a mile. Nov. 30 | 2 p.m. ET | Burlington, VT One of New England's underrated rivalries continues with both teams heavy favorites for NCAA tourney invites for their respective conferences. Yale might have a higher upside, but Vermont should be able to defend its home court to close Thanksgiving weekend.",https://www.espn.com/mens-college-basketball/story/_/id/46585305/mens-college-basketball-early-season-nonconference-games-watch-2025-26,Sport,BBC,,https://a4.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2025%2F1013%2Fr1559767_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg,,7b9c99e6365e60bb09ff09403a36f7ce7cb7fc2e

847335851d4c,NCAAF,,"OXFORD, Miss. -- The day the spring transfer portal opened for Division II football players in April, Ole Miss co-offensive coordinator Charlie Weis Jr. was glued to the computer screen in his office, watching highlights of then-Ferris State quarterback Trinidad Chambliss . When Weis wanted to confirm that he was really seeing what he thought he was seeing, he called in quarterbacks coach Joe Judge. Then, just to make sure they were both right about Chambliss' ability, they brought in co-offensive coordinator/tight ends coach Joe Cox for further confirmation. ""We better get Coach Kiffin,"" one of them said. As Ole Miss coach Lane Kiffin watched Chambliss scrambling and throwing deep balls, he saw the traits of someone familiar: former Miami quarterback Cam Ward , the No. 1 pick in April's NFL draft. The Rebels had recruited Ward when he left FCS program Incarnate Word after the 2021 season and believed he was coming to Ole Miss. But Ward signed with Washington State after it hired Incarnate Word coach Eric Morris as its offensive coordinator. Ward spent two seasons with the Cougars before playing his final one at Miami, where he was an All-American. ""By the time we were done watching the whole thing, there's about 12 people in there, like at a watch party,"" Kiffin said. Chambliss, who led Ferris State to a 14-1 record and its third Division II national championship in four seasons in 2024, was scheduled to visit Temple that week. ""Get him on the phone,"" Kiffin told his assistants. ""He's flying here tonight."" Chambliss arrived at Ole Miss soon thereafter, and Kiffin and the others sold him on a chance to compete with Austin Simmons for the starting quarterback job and playing against the best teams in the SEC. After receiving interest from about a dozen schools after entering the portal, Chambliss committed to play for the Rebels on April 15. Six months later, Chambliss is one of the hottest quarterbacks in the FBS, leading the No. 5 Rebels to four straight victories since taking over for Simmons, who injured his ankle in a 30-23 victory at Kentucky on Sept. 6. After stepping into the starting role in a 41-35 win against Arkansas on Sept. 13, Chambliss became the first SEC player with 300 passing yards and 50 rushing yards in three consecutive games over the past 30 years. He threw for 253 yards with two touchdowns and ran for another score in last week's 24-21 win against Washington State. Petre Thomas-Imagn Images Kiffin hasn't yet announced which quarterback will start in Saturday's showdown at No. 9 Georgia ( 3:30 p.m. ET, ABC ), but it would be a surprise if he didn't stick with Chambliss. Last week, Kiffin said Simmons wasn't fully recovered (he aggravated the injury in a brief appearance against the Razorbacks) and would have a chance to win the job back once he's healthy. ""He's quick, he's fast, he's tough, he's got great lower body, great instincts,"" Georgia coach Kirby Smart said of Chambliss. ""There's a difference [between] being a fast guy and being a runner. He's patient behind blocks, quick when he needs to be. [Ole Miss] should get the greatest award there is for finding this guy. I don't know who scouted him, who found him, but he is a really good football player that they went out and got and did a tremendous job."" Chambliss' unlikely underdog story has captured the imagination of Ole Miss fans, who are flying Trinidad and Tobago flags during games and around campus. ""It's been amazing,"" Chambliss said. ""It has been a dream come true. I prayed for this. I've dreamed of this. You can ask my friends from back home; this was a goal of mine ever since I was little. And my dad and my mom and my brother, we've been working for this moment my entire life, really."" NO, CHAMBLISS WASN'T named after the Caribbean dual-island nation of about 1.4 million people located off the Venezuelan coast. When Cheryl Chambliss was pregnant with her second child, she and her husband, Trent, came to an agreement: She would name the baby if it was a girl, and he would for a boy. Trent Chambliss, an assistant principal at Wyoming High School in Michigan, wanted a name that would stand out and was strong. He was at a friend's house watching a Félix Trinidad fight, and thought the Puerto Rican boxer's last name was perfect. Cheryl Chambliss, whose late father, Donald Griffioen, was a longtime pastor and helped open churches around the country, agreed to her husband's idea with one condition: She would name a baby girl Trinity, after the Christian doctrine that says God exists as three separate persons -- the Father, Son and Holy Spirit. ""We are a faith-based family,"" Cheryl Chambliss said. ""Trinidad was just fine with me because it translates to Trinity, and so that's very important. When people ask me, he is named after the Trinity."" Trinidad Chambliss had a stuffed football in his hands before he could walk, according to his father, Trent, who was a big Notre Dame fan. The Chambliss family Trinidad Jay Chambliss was born Aug. 24, 2002, about 11 years after his older brother, Tyler. Almost immediately, Trent put a ball in Trinidad's hands. Trent was an offensive lineman at Grand Rapids Junior College in Michigan and Central State University in Ohio for two seasons before he joined the Navy. Trent Chambliss grew up in South Bend, Indiana, and was an avid Notre Dame fan. A longtime high school football, basketball and bowling coach, he tossed a stuffed Fighting Irish football to his new son when he was only a few months old. Trinidad Chambliss went to a handful of football camps at Notre Dame and several Fighting Irish games. ""He was catching a ball before he could walk,"" Trent Chambliss said. ""I just threw everything at him -- socks, keys, whatever. The kid caught everything."" Trinidad Chambliss grew up playing baseball, basketball and football. In high school, he concentrated on the latter two sports, and believed he'd most likely play basketball in college. As a senior at Forest Hills Northern High in Grand Rapids, Michigan, he threw for 1,610 yards and 17 touchdowns in seven games at quarterback. He was named all-state in basketball after averaging 14.5 points and 4.5 assists. CHAMBLISS' SENIOR YEAR of high school in 2020-21 occurred during the COVID-19 pandemic, limiting his ability to attend camps and get exposure in front of college coaches. When it came time to pick a college, his options were limited to mostly junior colleges and Division III programs. ""No coach ever got to see him in person,"" said Eddie Ostipow, who coached Chambliss in football in his final two seasons of high school. ""And he was playing a lot of AAU basketball in the spring and summer. He loves football, but he really was focused on basketball. I think you put those two factors together and that's really the explanation of why he didn't get a ton of interest."" Among the teams recruiting him in basketball: Calvin University, Aquinas College, University of Olivet and Kalamazoo Valley Community College, all of which are located in Michigan. There were some familiar names involved in his football recruitment, but not the actual ones most college football fans know well: Notre Dame (the college in Ohio, not the university in Indiana), Michigan (Tech, not the powerhouse in Ann Arbor), Butler University (in football, not hoops), North Dakota (not FCS power North Dakota State) and Northwestern (the university in Lima, Ohio, not the one in Chicago that competes in the Big Ten). ""Honestly, I feel like I was just a late bloomer,"" Chambliss said. ""Growing up, I wasn't the biggest guy. I wasn't the strongest kid. Coming out of high school, going into my freshman year of college, I was probably 6 feet, like 175 pounds, so a little scrawny kid. I'm not the biggest guy. When coaches look at you out of high school, they say the eye test, and I didn't fit the eye test."" Tony Annese, a longtime high school coach in Michigan who took over the Ferris State program in 2012, was willing to give Chambliss a chance. He was given the equivalent of a 25% scholarship as a freshman in 2022, about $6,000 per year. ""He knew my family growing up, and he actually didn't recruit me because of my football abilities,"" Chambliss said. ""He went to a basketball game and saw that I was a point guard and could facilitate the ball and get people open and find a way to score. I think he took a shot on me, and he knew that I was athletic. I'm grateful that he gave me a chance."" Chambliss barely played as a freshman at Ferris State in 2022, as Kent State transfer Mylik Mitchell led the Bulldogs to their second straight Division II national championship. Annese prefers to play multiple quarterbacks, and Chambliss saw action in eight games the next season after gaining about 25 pounds. Last season, Chambliss won the starting job and was set to share snaps with junior Carson Gulker. In the opener at Pittsburg State in Kansas, Chambliss threw two interceptions in a 19-3 loss. ""I'd be lying to you if I said that there were no doubts that I could be the quarterback at Ferris State because there were definitely doubts,"" Chambliss said. ""I prayed after that game. I actually thanked God that happened because I feel like it was a lesson and an experience that I needed to go through. I feel like that helped our team and helped me as a player to persevere through adversity."" Chambliss became the first SEC player with at least 300 passing yards and 50 rushing yards in three consecutive games over the past 30 years. AP Photo/Rogelio V. Solis Gulker broke his right leg in a 56-3 win against Lake Erie the next week. Chambliss took the majority of snaps from there, and the Bulldogs won their last 14 games. He threw for three touchdowns and ran for two more in a 49-14 victory over top-seed Valdosta State in the Division II national championship game in McKinney, Texas. Chambliss passed for 2,925 yards and ran for 1,019 more with 51 total touchdowns in 2024. He was named an All-American and was a finalist for the Harlon Hill Trophy, the Division II Heisman Trophy. Mike Taylor co-founded AgDiago, an analytics firm that specializes in streamlining the evaluation of prospects and identifying behavioral traits. His company has worked with Ferris State the past five years, and AgDiago evaluated Chambliss when he was playing there. AgDiago also works with Notre Dame, LSU, Michigan and Kansas State, among other programs. ""With Trinidad, the things that were quickly unveiled were that he was highly persistent and overcame adversity very quickly,"" Taylor said. ""He's somebody that can flush a mistake quickly. It reminds me a lot when we looked at Jayden Daniels . There's a lot of similarities under the hood, so to speak, between him and Jayden Daniels. He's athletic, obviously, but he's a team-first guy. He's also very coachable, all while having a nice, strong work ethic."" After Chambliss' performance in the national title game, a few FBS schools, including UCF and Georgia State , reached out to Steve Calhoun, his private quarterbacks coach in California. They told Calhoun they'd be interested in signing him if he entered the transfer portal. ""I wasn't ready to leave Ferris State at that time,"" Chambliss said. ""It didn't feel right, honestly. I talked to my parents, and it just wasn't the right time."" That changed this past spring when more and more programs called. Chambliss and his father met with Annese in March and broke the news that he was leaving. They thanked Annese for giving him the chance that other coaches didn't. WHEN CHAMBLISS ARRIVED in Oxford, Mississippi, this summer, Kiffin and his coaches still weren't sure what kind of quarterback they had. They only knew they had a player with a great work ethic who was truly grateful for a chance to play big-time football. Kiffin joked that he sometimes has to remind Chambliss that the Gatorades in the football facility are free. ""I call it three-star syndrome versus five stars,"" Kiffin said. ""This is zero-star syndrome. This is the best of all times, you know? This is like buying a Christmas present for a rich kid versus a kid that has nothing, how they react and how they appreciate things. He never even went on an official visit in high school."" It didn't take long for Chambliss to win over Ole Miss fans or his Rebels teammates. Petre Thomas-Imagn Images Chambliss said his new teammates welcomed him with open arms, even if some of them might have Googled where he came from. ""A lot of guys are four-stars and five-stars that come to SEC schools,"" Chambliss said. ""They don't really know what Ferris State is or anything about Division II programs. I bet they were like, 'Ferris State? What is that?'"" It didn't take Kiffin and his assistants long to realize they might have landed a special quarterback once the Rebels started scrimmaging at Vaught-Hemingway Stadium during preseason camp. Ole Miss linebackers coach Chris Kiffin, the head coach's brother, dropped another big comparison earlier this season. Chris Kiffin was the Cleveland Browns' defensive line coach when Heisman Trophy winner Baker Mayfield was the team's quarterback in 2020 and 2021. Chris Kiffin said Chambliss walked like Mayfield, carried the same demeanor on the field, played loose with quick feet like Mayfield and wore the same jersey number (No. 6).

He just would make something happen. It was like, 'Oh, boy, what's he doing now?' He'd spin out, run all the way over there and make a play. I remember saying, 'I think this guy's one of those guys, one of those gamers.'"" At the very least, Lane Kiffin believed he had a capable backup if Simmons suffered an injury. Kiffin saw how losing a starting quarterback and not having another one to step in could affect a team​​ last season when the Rebels lost 24-17 at Florida. The Gators had been beaten badly by Georgia and Texas when starter DJ Lagway went down because of a hamstring injury. Florida won four straight games once Lagway returned. ""When we talk about salaries and [roster management], because obviously that's part of it, the investment in the quarterback position besides just the one who's supposed to be the starter is worth a lot of money,"" Kiffin said. ""All of that went into it -- seeing how great [Chambliss] was and seeing what happened with other teams. It had nothing to do with not having confidence in Austin."" Halfway through his first season at Ole Miss, Chambliss has won over his teammates and the school's rabid fan base. He's being mentioned as a sleeper Heisman candidate, especially if the Rebels keep winning. ""Heisman Trophy, the best player in college football, you dream of that,"" Chambliss said. ""It's crazy to hear my name. You play the video games, NCAA Football 14, and that's what you want to do. It's been amazing, but I can't really think about that right now."" If nothing else, Kiffin says Chambliss' story as a player who fell through the recruiting cracks to become an SEC starter might inspire kids at smaller schools around the country. ""This is such a good story for all the D-II and D-III players and all the high school kids not getting offers in small high schools,"" Kiffin said. ""This is such a good story for hope. Like, 'Hey, man, someone might find you.' Keep pushing, you know?""",https://www.espn.com/college-football/story/_/id/46583636/trinidad-chambliss-division-ii-ferris-state-breakout-star-quarterback-ole-miss,Sport,BBC,,https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2025%2F1014%2Fr1559636_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg,,a9fe74043f61768a9044289b70331d99af65d986
edcc79fab003,"NFL hot seats: Mike McDaniel, Justin Fields, John Harbaugh",,"The NFL typically overshadows most other sports stories on Sunday afternoons during the fall, but Penn State's decision to fire coach James Franklin was an exception to that rule. Fifteen days ago, Franklin's Nittany Lions were the No. 3-ranked team in college football. But after three straight losses, the university decided that it was better off paying Franklin a buyout of about $50 million and hiring someone else to run the football program. With UAB coach Trent Dilfer also getting fired on Sunday, the college football hot seat has officially been turned on. The same is true for the NFL, where the vast majority of the league's teams are now six games into the season. It's tougher for a coach, player or executive to treat a slow start or a rough patch of form like it's a temporary concern this far into the season. Subscribe: 'The Bill Barnwell Show' Let's talk today about the NFL hot seat. Should time be up for embattled coaches or overwhelmed quarterbacks? What needs to change for them to turn things around? I'll run through some of the most tenuous positions around the league, starting in Miami, where the players are even arguing in public that they need more leadership. (Update: Brian Callahan was fired by the Titans following their Week 6 loss. The section on him was written before Tennessee's move.) Jump to: McDaniel | Fields | Karty | Ringo Harbaugh | Hubbard Week 6: Lost 29-27 to the Chargers, dropping the Dolphins to 1-5. For a moment there, it looked like the Dolphins might get out alive. Reeling after a 17-point third quarter opened the game up for the Chargers, the Dolphins fought back. De'Von Achane 's second touchdown of the game made it 26-20 with eight minutes to go, and after the Chargers went four-and-out, the Dolphins drove downfield and scored another touchdown with 52 seconds left, taking a 27-26 lead. All McDaniel needed was one stop from his defense to seal up a home victory over a team leading the AFC West. That stop didn't come. On the second play of the ensuing drive, Jaelan Phillips and Chop Robinson immediately beat the right side of the Chargers' line, but Justin Herbert simply refused to go down and found Ladd McConkey on a shallow route. The only Dolphins player in the area was rookie safety Dante Trader Jr ., who couldn't even get close enough to miss a tackle attempt on McConkey. While the Chargers wideout inexplicably finished the play out of bounds, the 44 yards McConkey picked up put the Chargers in field goal range, from which they sealed a 29-27 victory. If the loss felt crushing, what happened after the game might have been even more painful. Tua Tagovailoa criticized the team's leadership for not clearly articulating expectations and added that members of the team have been late or have not shown up at all for players-only meetings. McDaniel noted that those meetings are outside his purview and felt like players were accountable to him, but that seems to be up for debate. ESPN's Marcel Louis-Jacques reported , per one former Dolphins player, that players were regularly late to meetings and practices throughout McDaniel's tenure with the team, only for those concerns to be ignored as the Dolphins won football games. Of course, when it comes to leadership and accountability, it's difficult to ignore what happened in Week 18 a little less than a year ago, when Tyreek Hill refused to enter a game against the Jets and hinted he was open to leaving the team afterward. The Dolphins essentially memory-holed that afternoon, not punishing Hill for what would be regarded as a potential career-ending act for a lesser player. (Note that nobody signed linebacker De'Vondre Campbell this offseason after he refused to enter a game for the 49ers last season.) It's not uncommon for teams to have different rules for star players, but if that situation wasn't going to have any repercussions, why would any of this team's notable players feel any concern about being late to a meeting? Hill's tenure with the team is likely done after the wide receiver sustained a severe knee injury while also facing allegations of domestic abuse , but the problems remain. And while the Dolphins were able to overcome whatever discipline or defensive problems they had in the past by thriving on offense, they haven't been able to put together a complete performance all season. Ironically, this was comfortably the best performance of the season for the much-maligned run game, with Achane running for 128 yards and two touchdowns on 16 carries, including a 49-yard scamper in the first quarter. Tagovailoa and the passing game weren't consistent. He threw three picks, though one was bobbled by Jaylen Waddle and another was picked at the beginning of what would likely be an attempted gadget or trick play with five seconds to go. Waddle made a spectacular juggling catch along the sideline for 45 yards, but he seemed to expect a pass over one shoulder and got it over the other. When pressured, Tagovailoa was 1-of-6 for 10 yards and an interception. Herbert was 7-of-13 for 105 yards in those spots, including the game-sealing throw to McConkey. That was the difference in the game. It's difficult to separate McDaniel's imprint on the offense from his players. The Miami offense has actually been a little better than you might think this season, with the Dolphins currently 12th in EPA per play on that side of the ball, just behind the Rams. That's with Hill sidelined for the year and the Dolphins getting one game from right tackle Austin Jackson , who serves as the team's blindside protector for its lefty quarterback. But an offense that used to look like it was ahead of the curve and perennially inventing new concepts for the rest of the league might have grown a bit stale. McDaniel is revered around the league for his run game and play design, but the Dolphins ran for just 19 yards against the Panthers in Week 5. The fury of run-pass options and in-breakers that created so many quick, safe completions for Tagovailoa haven't been as easy to find, and he is averaging 2.7 seconds before his pass attempts, which is the 11th-fastest rate in the league. Tagovailoa got rid of the ball at the fastest rate in the NFL in 2023 (2.36 seconds) and 2024 (2.42 seconds), but those windows aren't open as rapidly anymore. Tagovailoa is having to work harder for worse results. While I put this side of the problem more on general manager Chris Grier than McDaniel, there has been a general mismanagement of the draft picks the Dolphins had to work with after the Laremy Tunsil and Trey Lance deals. The Dolphins traded picks to acquire guys such as Hill, Bradley Chubb and Jalen Ramsey , with only the Hill deal standing out as a success. Miami guaranteed two years of Ramsey's contract as part of his trade , gave him a new deal the following season, and then traded him before that extension even kicked in. Meanwhile, the Dolphins let young cornerstone players such as Robert Hunt , Christian Wilkins and Jevon Holland leave in free agency. They brought in Vic Fangio and then fired the lauded defensive coordinator after one season. While Anthony Weaver has done a solid job since joining Miami, Fangio went to the Eagles and won a Super Bowl, completely turning around Philly's defense along the way. This version of the Dolphins doesn't look great on paper and hasn't played great in reality. The McDaniel case does remind me a little bit of what Baker Mayfield said last week. Asked about how perceptions have changed as he has grown in the league, Mayfield noted that he has always been the same person, but that the narratives surrounding him changed as his play improved and declined. When Mayfield was struggling, he was called cocky and immature, but when he is playing well, those character traits are reframed as positives. He's not wrong. It seems the same thing is happening with McDaniel. He was always an offensive-first coach who was hired because of his ability to get Tagovailoa going after the quarterback's slow start under former coach Brian Flores. That worked. McDaniel is the same guy, but it seems like Dolphins fans have either realized or decided, depending on who you ask, that he's not capable of doing anything more than getting their beloved team to the wild-card round. play 1:13 Why Justin Fields and the Jets should stay on fantasy sidelines Tristan Cockcroft explains why Justin Fields remains a matchup-driven option after his lowest fantasy output of the season. Per ESPN's Football Power Index, Miami's playoff odds fell to 2.0% after the loss, and history would tell us that Dolphins owner Stephen Ross wouldn't look kindly on anything short of a stunning turnaround. Since Ross bought the team in 2008, no Dolphins head coach has made it through four full seasons in the job. Tony Sparano was fired after starting 4-9 in Year 4, while Joe Philbin went down after a 1-3 opening to his fourth season. Adam Gase and Flores were each fired after three seasons in charge. With the reports of a lack of player discipline and visible sections of empty seats at home in Miami, the clock has to be ticking on McDaniel's tenure. The good news? The Dolphins are about to leave town for a two-game road trip with winnable games against the Browns and Falcons . Then again, winnable games against the Jets and Panthers were supposed to get the Dolphins back on track. But after beating the Jets , the Dolphins lost to the Panthers and fell at home to a banged-up Chargers team. It doesn't feel like things are safe for the 42-year-old coach. Week 6: Went 9-of-17 for 45 yards with nine sacks in a 13-11 loss to the Broncos. Minus-10 net passing yards . While Fields threw for 45 yards in London on Sunday, the nine sacks he took at the hands of a brutally efficient Broncos defense set the Jets backward. Leaving his scrambles aside, Fields generated minus-0.4 yards per dropback as a passer. It's the first time any quarterback has generated negative net yards on a day with 20 dropbacks or more since Jay Cutler did it against the Giants in 2010 . The Jets would have been better off spiking the ball 26 times, a move that would have offered more entertainment value than what they actually did on offense. The Jets won't be handed many better opportunities to win a game than what they saw Sunday. Facing a Broncos team that might have been lulled to sleep by Sean Payton telling them stories about his time at quarterback for the Leicester Panthers , the Jets were handed two short fields to start the game thanks to a Denver fumble and a 72-yard kick return. Those drives produced a total of 4 net yards and two field goals. The Jets' defense, which had been the league's worst in a 17-game sample since firing Robert Saleh by both EPA per play and points per drive, held the Broncos to 13 points on 11 meaningful drives. The unit even contributed two points by drawing a safety on a holding call in the end zone. play 1:33 What is the biggest issue with the Eagles' offense? Harry Douglas explains the biggest issues with the Eagles' offense after Philadelphia lost its second straight game. Yet Fields and the offense could do absolutely nothing to take advantage of those opportunities. Seven of their 12 possessions failed to produce first downs, and the Jets had just two drives produce 20 or more net yards. Most of that came on the ground, where Breece Hall gritted through 22 carries for 59 yards. Fields added seven carries for 31 yards. I normally wouldn't treat a backfield averaging 3.0 yards per carry as a mark of success, but the running game looked like prime Adrian Peterson and LaDainian Tomlinson compared to what the dropback passing game did for the Jets. It's fair to note that this posed a particularly tough matchup for the Jets. The Broncos are one of the league's best defenses, full stop. They have a superstar CB1 in Pat Surtain II . But teams do find plenty of success throwing against Riley Moss and Denver's other defensive backs. Vance Joseph's linebackers can also struggle in coverage, and the Eagles were able to exploit them last week , most notably on a 47-yard touchdown catch by Saquon Barkley . Well, the Jets didn't have those solutions. Garrett Wilson went up against Surtain on 62% of his routes, catching one pass for 4 yards. The only running back to catch a pass was Isaiah Davis , who turned his one target into minus-1 yard. Hall was so promising as a receiver that this offseason Aaron Glenn called him the kind of guy who ""you can split out wide and let him run the route tree, because he can run it like a receiver."" He had zero targets on 14 routes. (Hall has run a total of three routes split out wide in six games. When a coach tells you over the summer that his running back is going to split out wide and run a full route tree, just know that that coach is likely either lying to you or himself, and you'll find out which soon enough.) With his one star receiver blanketed by the opposing team's star cornerback, Fields wasn't able to find answers. Doing the broadcast, Kurt Warner repeatedly noted that Fields was late throwing out-breaking routes, even when Surtain was in coverage. Whether that's on Fields (for being nervous about throwing to the sideline or throwing with anticipation) or on Jets offensive coordinator Tanner Engstrand (for dialing up speed outs that Fields wouldn't be willing to throw) is hard to say, but the Jets weren't in position to turn down anything in the passing game Sunday. While nine sacks sound like the work of a dominant pass rush, I would say that only one or two of those sacks really erased the play before Fields had a chance to do anything. Every one of Fields' sacks came five seconds or more after the snap. And the two sacks on the final drive were both problematic. Fields actually had two receivers coming open on a first-and-10 sack in Denver territory with 1:56 to go, but he turned down an out to the sideline and then didn't have time to get to the backside of the play. Then, facing fourth-and-8 with the game on the line, Tyler Johnson had a step on Ja'Quan McMillian and an angle to the sideline, but Fields didn't throw the ball with anticipation. And when he held the ball, Jonathon Cooper 's rush through Mason Taylor blew up the play. Fields was excellent in Week 1 against the Steelers , but his only effective passing work since then has come while trailing against the Cowboys . Since Week 2, if we just look at plays that took place with a win expectancy of 20% or more, Fields' 10.7 QBR is the worst mark in the league. The average Fields dropback in those situations has generated 2.1 yards, a figure that includes both sacks and scrambles. It's clear that Glenn doesn't trust his quarterback. The Jets coach bungled a pair of fourth-down situations out of fear that he might have to rely on his offense, including a brutal process on a fourth-and-1 while the Jets were clinging on to a one-point lead in the fourth quarter. I was optimistic about Fields after the Steelers game in the opener, but he looked completely lost in this game against the Broncos. The problem for the winless Jets in potentially benching their starter, unfortunately, is there's not much to gain. Fields is already owed $10 million in guarantees next year as part of the $30 million he locked down in his deal with the Jets, so there are economic reasons to hope that he can turn things around. The backup here is Tyrod Taylor , who is 36 years old. I'm as big of a Taylor fan as anyone, but in 16 starts over the past seven years since leaving the Bills, Taylor has posted a 43.3 QBR, which ranks 63rd out of the 72 quarterbacks with 500 dropbacks or more over that span. (Fields' 47.4 mark is 47th.) Taylor would likely do a better job running the offense and making some of the throws that are available, but that would come at the expense of the explosiveness and big-play ability that Fields offers with his legs. The Jets would be trading a low-floor, high-ceiling quarterback for one a decade older with a moderate floor and virtually no ceiling. I wouldn't like that swap, but the Jets also probably win this game if Taylor is at quarterback. And after starting 0-6, the idea of being in position to win anything might appeal to Glenn and the Jets. Week 6: Went 1-for-2 on field goals (missing a 26-yarder) in a 17-3 win over the Ravens. It's rare to have a kicker make it into back-to-back Monday columns, but this is quickly becoming a topic of concern for the Rams. In what might be Matthew Stafford 's final NFL season, it's clear that Sean McVay's team has championship aspirations. While Sunday wasn't Stafford's best game, the 37-year-old has been up to that level for most of the 2025 season. The Rams have a pair of great receivers and a young, imposing defensive line. It's becoming clear, though, that their kicking operation is not up to the same standard. This has been a topsy-turvy year for Karty, who has played a key role in each of Los Angeles' losses this season. The second-year kicker had two field goals blocked in what ended up being a fateful loss to the Eagles . While I wouldn't necessarily pin that on Karty, he then missed a 53-yarder against the 49ers last week before having an extra point blocked and placing his overtime kickoff short of the end zone, handing San Francisco a short field on its drive for the game-winning field goal. In what were admittedly rainy, windy conditions in Baltimore on Sunday, Karty appeared to wear out his welcome. After Stafford missed Davante Adams twice in a row for potential touchdowns on the opening drive of the game, Karty lined up for a chip shot from 26 yards out, only for the wind to push his kick into the right upright. Kickers just don't miss in that range anymore, and unlike the Eagles game, there was no pressure or penetration from the Ravens' defense to hurry the kick. The Rams seemed to lean away from the kicking game after that point. Karty did kick a 36-yard field goal on the next drive, but it was on a fourth-and-11 in the red zone. McVay was more aggressive than usual as the game went along. The Rams attempted a fourth-and-2 on the Baltimore 33-yard line on their opening drive of the third quarter and a fourth-and-3 from the Baltimore 6-yard line early in the fourth. As is often the case when coaches are forced to be more aggressive than they would like, the results were actually slightly positive! The fourth-and-2 in the third quarter produced a 30-yard completion to Kyren Williams , who then punched in the first touchdown of the game on the next snap. The fourth-and-3 failed when Stafford was sacked, but the touchdown more than offset what the Rams would've gotten had they kicked field goals in both spots. Could McVay have been concerned about the weather in making his kicking game decisions? Potentially. After the game, though, it was telling that he offered a comment without even being asked a question by the assembled media. ""Obviously, you guys are going to ask me about about the field goal,"" McVay said . ""I thought the protection was good, [but] we have to make the kick."" McVay then went on to criticize the operation on the subsequent made field goal, which implies that he places the blame for the initial miss solely on his kicker. The Rams were 20th in the league in performance on field goal and extra point tries last season, per the FTN Football Almanac . They're unsurprisingly last in EPA per attempt and win probability on those kicks in 2025. Some of that doesn't fall on Karty's shoulders given the blocks, but nothing about his performance so far as a pro suggests that the Rams are dealing with a championship-caliber kicker. I also wonder whether McVay is looking over at his friends and rivals in San Francisco. Kyle Shanahan and the 49ers were keeping the faith in a kicker they drafted in the third round in 2023, sticking with Jake Moody into the start of the 2025 season even after a disappointing 2024 campaign. Once Moody went 1-of-3 on field goal attempts in the opener, though, the 49ers cut him and replaced him with Eddy Pineiro . The journeyman has proceeded to go 15-of-15 on field goal tries since, including four kicks from 50-plus yards -- most notably the 59-yarder that gave the 49ers a lead late in the fourth quarter over the Rams last week. Week 6: Allowed three catches for 69 yards as the nearest defender in coverage in a 34-17 loss to the Giants, per NFL Next Gen Stats. Howie Roseman's draft philosophy over the past few years has been brutally effective: Find a Georgia Bulldogs defender, draft him and profit . The Eagles' general manager has cleaned up on Georgia players, adding Jalen Carter , Jordan Davis , Nakobe Dean and Nolan Smith Jr . to one of the league's best young defensive front sevens. He even signed Azeez Ojulari away from the Giants in free agency, adding a fifth former Bulldog to the defense. All of ESPN. All in one place.

Roseman traded a 2024 third-round pick to acquire Ringo in the fourth round of the 2023 draft, the sort of impatient move the veteran GM usually prefers to be on the other side of making. Ringo wasn't involved on defense in 2023 until the late-season collapse, and with Quinyon Mitchell and Cooper DeJean emerging as stars in 2024, he averaged about four defensive snaps per game outside of a rest day for the starters in Week 18. After trading Darius Slay away during the offseason, the Eagles have flirted with different options on the outside at cornerback. Ringo was torched by Ja'Marr Chase in the preseason , which might have steered Vic Fangio to start Adoree' Jackson in the opener . After three games, Jackson was pulled for Ringo, who started each of the next two weeks. (Jackson was brought back into the fold when Mitchell went down injured Thursday against the Giants .) Ringo didn't have the best performance against the Giants. Early in the game, with New York facing a third-and-12, Ringo was outjumped on a 50-50 ball by Lil'Jordan Humphrey , who picked up 34 yards on the play. Wan'Dale Robinson ran away from Ringo on a crosser for 26 yards. An illegal contact penalty handed the Giants a free first down on a drive that eventually ended in a touchdown. And a 20-yard pass interference call against Ringo set the Giants up with a first-and-goal on the 1-yard line, which Cam Skattebo pounded in for another touchdown. After the pass interference call, the Eagles kept Ringo off the field for most of the fourth quarter, with the third-year pro coming back onto the field for only the final four snaps of the game, three of which were kneel-downs. Ringo himself admitted after the game that he didn't perform well enough, saying that he ""didn't play to my standard entirely."" The Eagles can keep the faith with Ringo. They can turn back to Jackson, who was run through on a touchdown by Skattebo and has already essentially been benched once this season. They could eventually look toward Jakorian Bennett , though the summer trade acquisition played just 24 defensive snaps in three games before being placed on injured reserve with a pectoral injury and doesn't have a clear timeframe for returning. To bring it full circle, though, this is Roseman's team. If there's one thing he's known for besides drafting Georgia defenders, it's making plenty of trades. With the deadline just weeks away and that outside cornerback role across from Mitchell and DeJean continuing to be a liability, would anyone be surprised if the Eagles made a move for a veteran cornerback who could step into the lineup at midseason? I'd expect Roseman to be hitting the phones in search of CB help between now and Nov. 4, which would squeeze Ringo out of a starting role. play 1:35 Is Rico Dowdle's fantasy production sustainable? Tristan H. Cockcroft breaks down whether Rico Dowdle can maintain his current fantasy output. Week 6: Lost 17-3 to the Rams, dropping the Ravens to 1-5. Even the league's best coaches have seen many of their legendary tenures come to ignominious ends. Andy Reid was run out of town in Philadelphia by Eagles fans who were convinced their veteran coach would never get them over the Super Bowl hump. Bill Belichick was fired after winning six Super Bowls in New England. Any coach who doesn't win a Super Bowl over a 12-year span in the same job is going to inspire some grumbling here and there, and every fan base fires its coach on social media after every loss. But Sunday was really the point where frustrations about Harbaugh came to the surface in Baltimore. After a Zay Flowers fumble and a quick touchdown drive by the Rams put the visitors up 17-3 in the third quarter, a notable portion of the crowd launched into a chant that hasn't been heard very often over the past two decades: ""Fire Harbaugh."" Of course, I recognize that Ravens fans didn't suddenly decide that they're frustrated with Harbaugh after five losses before the end of October. This is partly about the frustrations of the Lamar Jackson era, where the Ravens have been the best team in football during the regular season and made it past the divisional round only once in seven tries. It is about trying to find something to change about a team that felt as if it was inevitably going to come up short when things mattered most, even before their previously lofty floor collapsed amid a brutal run of injuries. It is also somewhat about the fact that Harbaugh is one of the league's CEO coaches, which means it's more difficult to tie his performance to one particular side of the ball. If Harbaugh had a background as an offensive or defensive assistant and called plays, it would be easy to marry his job performance to the performance of that unit. With Todd Monken in charge of the offense and Zach Orr running the defense, Harbaugh's most visible when it comes to making fourth-down decisions. And while I agreed with his decisions Sunday, the Ravens failed on four of their six fourth-down attempts against the Rams, including a goal-to-go sequence that ended with Derrick Henry getting stuffed for a loss. That's not going to thrill fans. Having said all that: I believe Harbaugh is a really good coach. The Ravens are 1-5 out of some combination of tough close-game luck against very good competition and a horrific run of injuries. If a pass doesn't deflect into Keon Coleman 's hands or Henry doesn't fumble down the stretch in Week 1 , is Harbaugh a better coach? Baltimore's rookie class isn't off to a great start, but the Ravens have brought through young talent for many years under Harbaugh with a lot of success. That has to mean something. Is there something innately lacking in Harbaugh that prevents the Ravens from winning a Super Bowl? I'm not sure I loved that argument with Reid in Philadelphia or with any other consistent playoff-visiting coach who came up short of the Super Bowl without Tom Brady or Patrick Mahomes at quarterback. Regardless, it certainly shouldn't apply to Harbaugh, who actually did win a Super Bowl. And unlike Reid, who started winning them after he landed a future Hall of Famer at quarterback, Harbaugh won his title with something less than the best version of those Ravens teams. His 10-6 squad ran through the AFC as the fourth seed, winning road games in Denver and New England along the way. I would argue the Ravens and Harbaugh can be a little slow to recognize the need for some changes. Remember the last time Harbaugh's job security was in question? It was 2018, when the Ravens had missed the playoffs in three consecutive seasons and were seemingly about to do so for a fourth consecutive year. Harbaugh had stuck by struggling starter Joe Flacco all season and refused to even publicly consider inserting Jackson, but when Flacco suffered a hip injury , Harbaugh was left with no choice. The 4-5 Ravens went 6-1 the rest of the way with Jackson under center and haven't looked back. The Ravens should get Jackson back from his hamstring injury after the bye, which should help the offense dramatically. The team has turned the ball over six times in two games after turning it over just 11 times all season in 2024. Monken's offense was operating at a high level before the injury. While the run game needs to get more consistent and Jackson needs to stop taking sacks at triple the rate he did a year ago, I'm not concerned about the offense. Can the defense get back on track? Harbaugh has already said that he doesn't plan on firing Orr, which means the change will have to come from within. With Kyle Hamilton and Marlon Humphrey returning to the lineup, this Baltimore defense was much improved on what we saw last week against Houston , albeit with the help of some missed passes, difficult weather and a midgame injury to Puka Nacua . If anything, we could see minor changes. The Ravens swapped Odafe Oweh for Alohi Gilman last week, a reflection on the reality that they just needed responsible adults in the secondary. Gilman played 82% of the snaps in his Ravens debut, which meant much less T.J. Tampa and Keyon Martin . Roquan Smith will be back after the bye and take over for Trenton Simpson . I wouldn't be shocked if the Ravens looked to add a veteran or two off the waiver wire or on the bottom of another team's roster to upgrade their thin defensive line. The biggest reason things should get better, though, is that the schedule is about to get much easier. After the bye, the Ravens play their next six games against teams that are a combined 9-24. They'll face at least one backup quarterback in Flacco of the Bengals, and it would hardly be a surprise if they faced a couple more along the way owing to likely benchings. There will be a lot of winnable contests ahead. But if the Ravens lose a bunch of these games to the likes of the Browns, Jets and Dolphins over the next two months? That's a different story. Until then, though, I don't think that Harbaugh's job should be in question. And frankly, as the crowd chanted ""Fire Harbaugh"" on Sunday, I suspect that there were a few owners and executives around the league who were quietly joining in, hoping that one of the best coaches in football might come available for them to hire. Week 6: Did not play in a 30-27 win over the Cowboys. I'm finishing up by including a player who is on this list by no fault of his own. Everyone else on the hot seat had a rough Week 6. Hubbard didn't even play, as he sat out his second consecutive game with a calf injury . Hubbard was averaging 4.1 yards per carry before the injury and had a pair of touchdowns in the passing game earlier this season. Hubbard's four-year, $33 million extension in November 2024 -- along with the ACL injury suffered by Jonathon Brooks -- suggested he would be the starter in Carolina for the 2025 campaign. Instead, that's now up in the air, and it has nothing to do with Hubbard. Rico Dowdle has simply taken over this backfield. One week after running for 206 yards in a win over the Dolphins , Dowdle went back to work in a self-described revenge game against his former employer, the Cowboys. Dowdle ran 30 times for 183 yards and added a team-high 56 receiving yards. Dowdle became the first player since Dalvin Cook in 2020 to rack up 200 yards from scrimmage in consecutive games, a feat that has happened only 31 times in NFL history. And while the massive game against the Dolphins was fueled by a handful of huge gains, Dowdle's longest run on Sunday went for 15 yards. He simply gashed the Cowboys for meaningful yardage drive after drive, with 20 of Dowdle's 30 rush attempts being deemed successful by the NFL Next Gen Stats model. Over the past five years, just three other backs have posted a higher success rate in a game where they carried the ball at least 25 times. What's even more impressive is that Dowdle is doing this without the sort of help other great runners have around the league. The Panthers are down to bare bones up front. The entire right side of their line was missing Sunday. Center Austin Corbett and right guard Robert Hunt are on injured reserve , while right tackle Taylor Moton was inactive with an elbow injury. The Cowboys aren't a great defense by any stretch of the imagination, but they were 18th in the league in EPA per play against designed runs before Sunday. The Panthers did a great job of creating running lanes for Dowdle, but he also did a great job of making decisive cuts and getting the most out of what was blocked. He also added three first downs as a receiver, including a 36-yard touchdown on a blown coverage from Dallas' oft-frustrating linebackers. Dowdle ran by struggling Cowboys linebacker Kenneth Murray Jr . for a 13-yard catch and a first down earlier in the game. He is not Christian McCaffrey or Alvin Kamara , but Dowdle has made a meaningful impact in the receiving game over the past two weeks. While Hubbard is expected to return from his injury shortly, I'm not sure how the Panthers can go back to the prior status quo, when Hubbard was the lead back and Dowdle the backup. Dowdle was already getting about 10 carries per game before his sudden star turn, but he has earned the lion's share of the work at running back now, even if that's through no fault of Hubbard's own. Week 6: Lost 20-10 to the Raiders, dropping the Titans to 1-5. UPDATE: Callahan was fired Monday . Last Sunday's win was supposed to be the light at the end of the tunnel. Yes, the Cardinals essentially regurgitated their fourth-quarter lead and handed a victory to the previously winless Titans in Week 5. No, it would be foolish to assume that every team was going to be as indifferent to the football as Arizona was near the end zone. On a day where the Titans' defense slowed down the Cardinals for three quarters and Cam Ward hit a number of big-time throws to Calvin Ridley in key moments, though, Callahan could credibly go to his locker room and say that Titans at least had something to build upon, even if it was built on something resembling a house of cards. It's still very dark in Nashville. After their dramatic victory, how did the Titans respond? Jeffery Simmons admitted to ESPN's Turron Davenport after the game that the team had one of its worst weeks of practice . They came to Las Vegas to face a reeling Raiders team and went down 17-0 before responding. With Ridley sidelined early on by a hamstring injury , the Titans racked up just 22 net yards on their first five drives before a sixth drive at the end of the second quarter ended with a brutal interception from Ward, who held the ball too long and had his pass tipped.

The offensive line was supposed to be the strength of this team, both by virtue of coaching (legendary coach Bill Callahan, Brian's father, arrived along with his son in 2024) and investment. The Titans used consecutive first-round picks on Peter Skoronski and JC Latham and spent big to sign Lloyd Cushenberry III , Kevin Zeitler and Dan Moore Jr . in free agency. Latham has been out since the opener, and replacement John Ojukwu was arguably playing like the worst player in the league before being benched himself. Still, Latham's return to the lineup was supposed to solidify things Sunday. Instead, Latham allowed two sacks and six pressures. He appeared to be at fault on a brutal strip sack of Ward in the second quarter, when nobody blocked Devin White as the linebacker rushed through the B-gap, handing the Raiders a short field that led to a touchdown. Playing against Maxx Crosby is tough, but the Titans took Latham with the seventh pick in the draft. They rely on him. He struggled badly in pass protection at left tackle a year ago and has now allowed three sacks in two games on the right side this season. And Moore leads the NFL with six sacks allowed, per NFL Next Gen Stats. Some of that is on Ward, but the Titans can't be too shocked, given that Moore also led the league in sacks allowed last season. The tough part for Brian Callahan is that he has already ceded responsibilities. His father presumably plays a big role in designing the run game, which ranks 28th in the league in EPA per play on designed runs. He also handed over playcalling duties to Bo Hardegree at 0-3. The offense didn't move much; it was 32nd in EPA per play with Callahan calling the plays and jumped all the way to 30th after the shift, though that's mostly been a product of the Browns and Ravens changing quarterbacks below them. In terms of game management, it's hard to argue that Callahan has been up to the task. He was involved in a bizarre controversy in Week 1 , where he neglected to challenge an incomplete pass call on Titans receiver Elic Ayomanor because he had only an elbow inbounds. (One elbow, as you probably know, equals two feet.) In Week 2 , the Titans were lined up for a 57-yard field goal, only for Callahan's indecisiveness to lead to a delay of game penalty, with the ensuing 62-yarder getting blocked. In Week 4 , while trailing 26-0 to the Texans and inside his own 5-yard line with 1:50 to go, Callahan handed the ball to Tony Pollard three consecutive times, putting unnecessary hits on the 28-year-old's body. Callahan's role is likely dependent on how he does developing Ward. Six games isn't an entire picture, but so far, Ward's 25.0 QBR ranks last in the league by a comfortable margin. The guys directly ahead of him have either been benched ( Jake Browning , Russell Wilson or Joe Flacco) or seem to be in real danger of losing their job ( Geno Smith , Justin Fields ). Ward has a talented arm, and he has made some excellent throws this season, but the Titans haven't done enough to insist that their young QB get the ball out quickly. That has led to pick-sixes, strip sacks and unnecessary hits. Some of Ward's most successful plays have been wildly dangerous passes across his body. Those are fun, but there's no consistency to the Titans' offense. Ward is taking sacks on nearly 11% of his dropbacks, which was supposed to be an area where the Titans would improve after Will Levis was taken down on 12% of his dropbacks in 2024. All of the easy buttons the Titans should be able to hit for their young quarterback aren't working. They're last in the league in EPA per play on screens at an almost-unbelieveable minus-0.42 mark. On Sunday, their five screens picked up a total of 8 yards. On four of those five screens, there was at least one blown block or major blocking mistake that led to the play not succeeding. Those plays all look good on paper, and the Titans had blocking advantages on a number of them. If the players repeatedly can't or don't execute, is that on them or the coaching staff? I can see the argument for not forcing a change. Bad organizations get caught in a cycle of swapping out coaches at the first sign of struggles from their young quarterbacks, resulting in a steady stream of new voices, new concepts and unfamiliar rules. Callahan came from Cincinnati, where Zac Taylor was 10-29-1 at the bye of his third season with the team. The Bengals went 5-3 down the stretch, got hot in the postseason and made it to the Super Bowl. They made it to the AFC Championship Game the following season. What has happened since suggests that Taylor probably isn't as good as he looked in 2021 and 2022, but he also wasn't as overmatched as he seemed in 2019 and 2020, either. Without arguing that the Titans should fire Callahan, though, there needs to be some consistent signs of improvement. The offensive line needs to look as if they can reliably pass-block. There needs to be some semblance of a run game. Ward needs to look as if he is improving. The game management can't be a major drag on operations. Since hiring Callahan, the Titans have changed the quarterback, the running back, their top two wide receivers and four of the five starters along the offensive line. They're the worst offense in the NFL. If Callahan is part of the solution moving forward, that has to change.",https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/46573291/2025-nfl-week-6-hot-seat-watch-coaches-players-mcdaniel-fields-harbaugh-callahan,Sport,BBC,,https://a4.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2025%2F1013%2Fr1559424_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg,,13e85c98a94890117c4dd92995b2dd94654d900a
2f2e5db2af9d,Titans fire coach Brian Callahan: What's next for Tennessee?,,"Oct 13, 2025, 03:58 PM ET NASHVILLE, Tenn. -- When the Tennessee Titans hired Brian Callahan to be their coach last year, there was a belief that he would help modernize the offense and turn the franchise around, but that didn't happen, and on Monday, Tennessee fired Callahan six games into the season. The Titans hired the former Cincinnati Bengals offensive coordinator in January 2024 in hopes of history repeating itself with his track record with quarterbacks. Callahan worked with the likes of Hall of Famer Peyton Manning, Matthew Stafford , Derek Carr and, most recently, Joe Burrow . Stafford, Manning and Burrow all led their teams to Super Bowls, with Manning and Stafford taking home Vince Lombardi Trophies. Callahan finished with a 3-14 record in his first season with second-year quarterback Will Levis -- who passed for 2,091 yards to go along with 13 touchdowns and 12 interceptions in an injury-plagued first year as the Day 1 starter. The coach was brought in before the 2024 season to help develop Levis, but that fell short. As a result, the Titans were awarded the No. 1 pick and drafted current starter Cam Ward , but even that got off to a rocky start. After going 0-4, the Titans got their first win this season -- an improbable 22-21 victory over the Arizona Cardinals . But that seemed to have bought Callahan only an extra week. After a 4-19 record with Tennessee, that hope has fizzled. Now the Titans are once again in search of their next coach with their previous one, Mike Vrabel, coming to town leading the 4-2 New England Patriots . The Tennessee Titans fired second-year coach Brian Callahan after starting the season with a 1-5 record. David J. Phillip/AP Our experts weighed in on what could be up next for the Titans and what to make of the move: What does this mean for the Titans? The Titans have parted ways with two head coaches and two general managers in four straight seasons. Entering this season, the future looked bright with Ward leading the way after setting the NCAA career touchdown passing record with 156 at Miami. But Ward has gotten off to a slow start, having only completed 55% of his passes for 1,101 passing yards, three touchdowns and four interceptions. Now the organization has to pick up the pieces. General manager Mike Borgonzi and president of football operations Chad Brinker have to find someone who can get things back on track as the franchise is starving for positive momentum leading up to February 2027, when the new stadium is set to open. -- Turron Davenport Why now? The Titans' front office needed to see improvement in Callahan's second season, not necessarily with a wins-and-losses goal in mind but with overall style of play, toughness, discipline and efficiency -- the factors that contribute to winning. The Titans were declining in those areas. That expedited the process. As one team source put it, the ""writing was on the wall"" when Callahan relinquished playcalling duties three weeks into the season. That was considered a troubling sign for some of the coaches, putting them on high alert for potential change as early as Week 5. Defensive tackle Jeffery Simmons , the team's best player, told reporters after Sunday's 20-10 loss to the Las Vegas Raiders that the past week was ""probably one of our worst weeks of practice."" Such words from a star player carry weight. -- Jeremy Fowler How does this affect Ward? Ward has lobbied for stability since training camp. ""You see it with the best quarterbacks out there,"" Ward, 23, said in August. ""I think a lot of guys who have stability in the NFL can succeed long term. That's what we need in Tennessee. We haven't had that in a very long time."" Having a new coach one year into Ward's career is the opposite of stability. Ward will now have to learn a new scheme and establish a connection with the new coach. Ward's development could be stunted if the next coach doesn't find ways to get him in a position to make an impact. Callahan was hired to develop the Titans' next franchise quarterback, and Ward has certainly shown he's capable of being that player. Now, another coach will get a crack at making the development process successful. -- Davenport play 1:03 Who Dan Orlovsky would like to see as next Titans coach Dan Orlovsky lists five coaches who could develop Cam Ward and the Titans following the firing of Brian Callahan. Will the Titans look to move players at the trade deadline? They're obviously in rebuild mode now around a rookie quarterback and could always use more draft picks. So if the offers are right, the Titans could absolutely consider moving on from guys who aren't part of their future. Players who could interest teams include 35-year-old guard Kevin Zeitler and 33-year-old wide receiver Tyler Lockett , who are both on one-year contracts. Edge rusher Dre'Mont Jones isn't signed beyond this season, and neither is cornerback Roger McCreary , who was a second-round pick in 2022 -- which now feels like three or four Titans administrations ago. Keep an eye on all those guys as we near the Nov. 4 trade deadline. -- Dan Graziano How attractive will this job be in the winter? The Titans job has selling points. Many evaluators are high on Ward despite his sluggish start. Brinker and Borgonzi want to build through the draft, which requires patience. They likely will show more of that with the next coach, since both will have a heavy influence on the hiring. Tennessee plays in a thriving city (Nashville), and the AFC South has been among the league's weaker divisions in past years. But the rampant turnover under owner Amy Adams Strunk since December 2022 could dissuade some candidates. The next coach would be prudent to ask hard questions about how Tennessee plans to shed the dysfunction label. -- Fowler What could the Titans do in the draft with another top pick? The Titans are projected to pick No. 2 by ESPN's Football Power Index , and they have to look at building an offense around Ward. The scheme needs to change, and that will come with a new coach, but what Ward really needs is dependable playmakers and much better protection. The wide receiver class doesn't have an elite top-5 type, but it has a good mix of players that I call ""professional route runners"" -- guys like Jordyn Tyson (Arizona State), Germie Bernard (Alabama) and even Carnell Tate (Ohio State). Protecting Ward is going to be just as important, and despite spending heavy draft capital along the offensive line in recent drafts, the Titans still struggle to protect the passer. That's why I like Miami's Francis Mauigoa as an option. He has right tackle experience, but some scouts think he could be an elite guard if he kicks inside. But regardless of whether he plays inside or outside, he would boost a bad offensive line. -- Matt Miller",https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/46583914/tennessee-titans-fire-brian-callahan-mean-cam-ward,Sport,BBC,,https://a4.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2025%2F1013%2Fr1559663_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg,,e7240c144470a35b46056cc3bd1c65f090add40c
97e4a658839a,Fantasy Football,,"Oct 14, 2025, 09:17 AM ET Everything that happens in the NFL has some additional context when viewed from a fantasy football perspective. From position battles to injuries and so much more, the news cycle will constantly affect player values in fantasy football. Our Fantasy Football Buzz file, with contributions from our ESPN fantasy writers and our NFL Nation reporters, aims to provide fantasy managers with the intel they need as news breaks around the NFL. Key links: Fantasy depth charts | Weekly rankings Scoring leaders | Projections | The Playbook London, Robinson shine on eventful Monday night in fantasy Drake London and Bijan Robinson combined for 67.6 fantasy points against the Bills, swinging the result of fantasy matchups in the process. AP Photo/Mike Stewart By Eric Moody Drake London posted season highs in targets (16), receptions (10), receiving yards (158) and fantasy points (31.8). He's the first Falcons player with 100-plus receiving yards and a receiving touchdown in consecutive games since Calvin Ridley in 2020. After a slow start, London is finally delivering the type of performance fantasy managers expected heading into the season. Bijan Robinson delivered the kind of performance that reminded fantasy managers why he was the No. 1 pick in drafts this summer. He posted a season-high 25 touches and 35.8 fantasy points, racking up 238 scrimmage yards, the fourth most in a game in Falcons history, trailing only Julio Jones . Robinson also finished with a career-high 100 rushing yards after contact. Another notable development was that Robinson lined up at wide receiver more in this game than in any other this season or last. Kyle Pitts Sr . finished with a season-high 18.0 fantasy points back in Week 4 against the Commanders, but coming out of the bye, he followed it up with just 4.8 on Monday night. However, even though Pitts is splitting snaps with Charlie Woerner , he still led the tight end room in routes run by a significant margin against the Bills. Josh Allen finished with just 15.4 fantasy points, his second-worst performance of the season. He was pressured on 47.1% of his dropbacks, his highest rate since the 2020 AFC Championship Game. Allen had mixed results under duress, going 4-of-9 with a touchdown and two interceptions, while also taking four sacks and scrambling three times for 34 yards. It's something fantasy managers should keep in mind heading into the bye, with Buffalo facing a tougher schedule the rest of the way, according to Mike Clay's strength of schedule cheat sheet. Jacory Croskey-Merritt led the Commanders' backfield in snaps, routes run and touches (18). He finished with just 5.8 fantasy points against the Bears, but the usage was very encouraging. Croskey-Merritt next faces a Cowboys defense in Week 7 that has allowed the third-most fantasy points per game to running backs. D'Andre Swift finished with 16 touches and 25.5 fantasy points against the Commanders. He became the first Bears player with at least 100 rushing yards and 50 receiving yards in a game since Matt Forte in 2014. While Swift led the backfield in snaps, routes run and touches, this was the first game this season Kyle Monangai was more involved early on. Swift is also running behind a Bears offensive line that ranks third in run block win rate and faces one of the most favorable running back schedules for the rest of the season. Caleb Williams finished with 19.8 fantasy points and has scored at least 19 points in three of five games this season. He's the first QB in Bears franchise history to record at least 200 passing yards and one passing touchdown in each of the team's first five games. From a film perspective, Williams is performing much better against the blitz this season, as the stats reflect. His success against the blitz continues an encouraging trend, with six touchdowns and zero interceptions against opposing blitzes. Injuries to monitor coming out of Week 6 Puka Nacua had to be helped off the field after injuring his lower left leg in the second quarter on Sunday. Patrick Smith/Getty Images By Stephania Bell Puka Nacua , WR, Rams (ankle): Nacua appeared to injure his left leg on an attempted leaping catch in the end zone early in the second quarter. He landed awkwardly on his left forefoot with the majority of his weight coming down on the left side along with the weight of a defender. In obvious discomfort afterward, Nacua reached for his lower shin just above the ankle. He was eventually assisted off the field and into the tunnel by the medical staff, with his arms around them for support. After the half, Nacua returned to the sideline and eventually reentered the game but didn't touch the ball again. After the game, coach Sean McVay told reporters Nacua would undergo further testing when the team returned to the facility, adding that Nacua's status for Week 7 (in London) was uncertain. With Nacua reentering the game, it might seem unusual that he would then be held out a week later. It's not unusual, however, for injuries to declare themselves to a greater degree within 24-48 hours postgame, whether it be symptomatic (pain/stiffness), swelling/bruising or additional information that emerges via imaging or other testing. Marvin Harrison Jr ., WR, Cardinals (concussion): In the second quarter of Sunday's game against the Colts, Harrison's head took a hard hit to the ground as he was tackled following a 21-yard reception. He was taken inside the blue tent for evaluation, as is common for an initial concussion screen; the results indicated further testing was warranted and Harrison was taken to the locker room. The Cardinals eventually announced he would not return because of a concussion. Harrison is now in the concussion protocol and must not only pass the progressive phases to return to action, but also must be cleared by the team physician and an independent neurological consultant. While it is often the case that athletes miss at least one game following a concussion, it is not a time-based protocol but rather criterion-based. Emeka Egbuka , WR, Buccaneers (hamstring): Egbuka, in his first game serving as the No. 1 wide receiver with Mike Evans (hamstring) and Chris Godwin Jr . (fibula) out, exited the game against San Francisco in the second quarter with a hamstring strain. It didn't take long for the team to rule out his return. After the game, coach Todd Bowles told reporters Egbuka was still being evaluated. An MRI is often used to better evaluate the specific size, location and depth of the injury, which helps shape rehab timeframes and treatment. There is no prognosis yet on the timeline for Egbuka, but if the injury is truly not serious, it could range from no missed time to 1-3 weeks. Calvin Ridley , WR, Titans (hamstring): Just when Ridley seemed to have found his groove with a strong Week 5 performance, he suffered a hamstring injury Sunday after just one catch for 18 yards. According to coach Brian Callahan, Ridley had ""a hamstring that popped up early and [he] couldn't get through, couldn't open up and run."" It is unclear what the severity of Ridley's injury is, but more details will hopefully be forthcoming after he undergoes additional evaluation at the start of the week. Who got the ball on Sunday? play 1:10 Where does Kimani Vidal stand among fantasy RBs in Week 7? Eric Moody weighs in on Kimani Vidal's impactful Week 6, and says fantasy managers should look to utilize him as an RB2 in Week 7. By Eric Moody A peek at a fantasy analyst's Sunday game notes. Running backs Breece Hall has played a high percentage of the snaps in the Jets' backfield this season and is averaging 17.5 touches per game. The good news is that the volume is there and the Jets' offensive line ranks eighth in run block win rate. The bad news is that Justin Fields ' inconsistent play can lead to down weeks such as this one, with only 5.9 fantasy points against Denver. The Jets' rest-of-season schedule for running backs gets tougher, and the Panthers in Week 7 won't be a breeze. New York then faces the Bengals in Week 8 before heading into a Week 8 bye, and Cincinnati's defense allows the most fantasy points per game to running backs. This sets up a strong opportunity for managers to trade Hall while his value is still high. Zach Charbonnet led the Seahawks' backfield in snaps, routes and touches (13) against the Jaguars. Charbonnet and Kenneth Walker III have both been heavily involved all season, which makes either one difficult to trust in fantasy lineups. Michael Carter started at running back for the Arizona Cardinals against the Colts, finishing with 11 touches and 8.4 fantasy points. Bam Knight had 12 touches and 12.4 fantasy points thanks to a rushing touchdown. Both players saw a similar number of snaps, but Carter ran more routes, giving him added involvement in the passing game. Tyjae Spears led the Titans' backfield in snaps and routes run, but Tony Pollard still saw more touches, finishing with 12 to Spears' nine. Rhamondre Stevenson led the Patriots' backfield in snaps, routes and rushing attempts (13) but managed just 1.8 fantasy points, marking his fourth straight game of fewer than 40 rushing yards. TreVeyon Henderson had 10 touches for 4.6 fantasy points, proving more effective. It remains to be seen whether that performance will lead to increased usage for the rookie. Both backs are low-end flex plays for now. Isiah Pacheco led the Chiefs' backfield in snaps, routes run, touches (13) and fantasy points (6.1), while also seeing a high percentage of short-yardage and goal-line opportunities thanks to a positive game script for the Chiefs, who were ahead the entire second half. Wire receivers play 0:59 Can Kayshon Boutte build on a successful Week 6 in fantasy? Eric Karabell explains why he expects Kayshon Boutte to continue his recent fantasy success in Week 7 vs. the Titans. Chris Olave led the Saints' WR/TE room in snaps, routes and targets (10) and finished with a season-high 98 receiving yards against the Patriots. It was his fifth game with at least six receptions and 50 yards, and he has scored 11 or more fantasy points in five of six games. Olave has only one touchdown but elite volume, seeing 10 or more targets in five games. With an easier schedule ahead, he's a strong hold or candidate to trade for. Travis Hunter set a career high in offensive snaps against the Seahawks, all in three-receiver sets. The Jaguars ran more 11 personnel than usual, influenced by the game script and Brenton Strange 's absence. Stefon Diggs disappointed against the Saints, catching just three passes for 28 yards as the Patriots leaned on the run and spread targets. While he'll have big games, Diggs is a volatile bench asset, often lining up in the slot and sharing snaps with DeMario Douglas , making him hard to trust as a weekly starter. Jerry Jeudy led the Browns with 13 targets and scored 9.3 fantasy points in a game in which rookie QB Dillon Gabriel attempted 52 passes. The bigger story is Isaiah Bond , who played almost as many snaps and ran nearly as many routes as Jeudy. If David Njoku misses time with his thigh injury, Bond stands to be an even bigger part of the offense. Hollywood Brown scored 20.5 fantasy points on two touchdowns, but Xavier Worthy led the Chiefs' wide receiver room in snaps and routes run, though he had just four targets and finished with 10.2 fantasy points. Rashee Rice is set to return from his six-game suspension next week, which hurts the fantasy value of both Brown and JuJu Smith-Schuster . In three full games last season, Rice commanded a massive 36% target share and averaged 21.6 fantasy points per game. After Calvin Ridley 's hamstring injury, Van Jefferson moved to the Titans' X receiver spot, with Elic Ayomanor shifting to Z. Jefferson caught four of six targets for 11.5 fantasy points, continuing the trend of X receivers thriving against the Raiders. Monitor Ridley's health, but with a tough rest-of-season schedule for Tennessee's wideouts, it's hard to trust any Titans receiver consistently in fantasy lineups. Tight ends play 0:39 Why Harold Fannin Jr. shouldn't be overlooked in fantasy Liz Loza breaks down Harold Fannin Jr.'s upward trend in fantasy ahead of the Browns matchup against the Dolphins in Week 7. Evan Engram was more involved in the Broncos' offense against the Jets than he had been in previous weeks, finishing with 9.9 fantasy points in a game in which Denver's receivers weren't much of a factor. However, it was Nate Adkins , not Engram, who scored the receiving touchdown, and despite the uptick in usage (at least six targets in three straight games), Engram is still splitting snaps and routes with Adam Trautman and Adkins, making him hard to trust in fantasy lineups. Mason Taylor finished with just one reception for 1.2 fantasy points in a game in which the Jets managed only 82 total yards of offense, which was the third-lowest single-game total in franchise history. One silver lining is that Taylor played over 90 percent of the snaps for the first time in his career. According to Mike Clay's strength of schedule, the Jets have the fourth-easiest rest-of-season schedule for tight ends. Isaiah Likely led all Ravens tight ends in snaps and routes run against the Rams, making now a great time to add him. Considering Baltimore's record and that Mark Andrews is in the final year of his contract, there's a real chance the veteran could be traded before the deadline. Darren Waller finished with just three targets and 9.2 fantasy points (thanks to a touchdown) but the key stat is that his snaps played continue to rise. That increased involvement will pay off as he has scored 17 fantasy points in two of his three games this season despite being brought slowly into the offense. More from Sunday: Week 6 winners and losers: Dowdle, Mahomes and Smith-Njigba deliver; time to sack Fields? Early Week 6 takeaways: Is red-hot Dowdle in line to leapfrog Hubbard in Panthers' backfield? play 1:35 Is Rico Dowdle's fantasy production sustainable? Tristan H. Cockcroft breaks down whether Rico Dowdle can maintain his current fantasy output. By Liz Loza Rico Dowdle stays hot in Week 6 Dowdle found the end zone and rumbled his way to triple-digit yardage serving as the replacement for Chuba Hubbard for the second consecutive week. The former Dallas Cowboy touched the ball 34 times, logging 239 scrimmage yards and a receiving touchdown while facing his old team. Dowdle has now cleared 22 rushing attempts and collected at least three balls in back-to-back outings. Carolina will travel to the Meadowlands in Week 7, taking on a Jets defense that gave up 78 rushing yards on 26 attempts versus the Broncos in London. Assuming Hubbard remains sidelined, Dowdle projects as a top-15 fantasy play at the position. He might have very well gained control of the backfield's top spot even if Hubbard is healthy enough to suit up. Kimani Vidal leads the Chargers backfield Omarion Hampton 's absence created a flurry of speculation as to which backup would take charge of the Bolts' rushing opportunities. Vidal came away the clear winner, registering 18 carries for 124 rushing yards while converting three of four targets for 14 receiving yards. With volume on his side, the second-year RB took advantage of a plus matchup against Miami's bottom-ranked run defense, posting 22.8 fantasy points in Week 6. He'll take on an above-average Indianapolis Colts squad in Week 7. Derrick Henry regains his crown Despite being stuffed at the goal line in the game's first half, Henry rebounded Sunday. The Ravens fed the vet early and often, helping him reach 90 rushing yards before halftime. Despite the Ravens falling to the Rams 17-3, Henry averaged 5.1 YPC, clearing 100 rushing yards for the first time since Week 1. Baltimore goes on bye in Week 7, but Henry's production should continue to pick up from there, especially if Lamar Jackson returns in Week 8. Marvin Harrison Jr . exits early Harrison suffered what was being reported as concussion-like symptoms in the first half of Arizona's game at Indianapolis. Jacoby Brissett (who was starting in the stead of Kyler Murray ) focused the bulk of his efforts on Trey McBride (8-72-1), Zay Jones (5-79) and Michael Wilson (4-44). Fantasy managers should brace for both Harrison and Murray sitting out next Sunday's tilt versus Green Bay. Drake Maye continues to produce Maye posted more than 20 fantasy points for the third time in five weeks this past Sunday. The second-year signal-caller led his team to a third straight victory, throwing for 261 yards, 3 TDs and 0 INTs while the Patriots beat the Saints 25-19. Maye also buoyed his fantasy stock on the ground, taking off nine times for 28 rushing yards. He has now managed at least 25 rushing yards and/or found the end zone in four of his past five outings. He'll offer virtual investors top-10 positional appeal in another solid matchup at Tennessee (70.2 COMP% allowed) in Week 7.",https://www.espn.com/fantasy/football/story/_/id/40699880/fantasy-football-injuries-position-battles-nfl-news-analysis,Sport,BBC,,https://a4.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2025%2F1014%2Fr1559982_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg,,48e6313763a3c5c949107a657f3aaf66686dd545
db0c7fbe1af2,Fantasy Football,,"The sixth Sunday of the NFL season featured another fantastic performance from Carolina Panthers RB Rico Dowdle , another touchdown from Dallas Cowboys WR George Pickens , and continued development from precocious New England Patriots QB Drake Maye as a top-10 fantasy option. Oh, there were injuries, too, with excellent wide receivers Puka Nacua (ankle), Emeka Egbuka (hamstring) and Marvin Harrison Jr . (concussion) leaving games prematurely. Fantasy managers must monitor their status for the upcoming week. Each Monday, before the current NFL week ends, we will identify players available in at least 50% of ESPN standard leagues worthy of your attention, from standard formats to deeper options. The NFL is a weekly league, and player valuation and roles seldom remain stagnant. It does not matter how you acquire players for your fantasy rosters, just that you get them. Quarterback Jaxson Dart , New York Giants (34.4% rostered): This is not the first time we have discussed Dart in this space, though fantasy managers remained rather tepid with interest. Dart was active in fewer than 10% of ESPN standard leagues in Week 6. That must change after Dart scored 23.6 points in a stunning win over the beleaguered Philadelphia Eagles . Although Dart remains an unfinished product as a passer, he has notably rushed for more than 50 yards in each of his three starts, scoring touchdowns in two of them. That is enough to make him relevant in fantasy. A road game in Denver this week might not be as much fun as facing Philly, but Dart boasts undeniable QB1 potential in fantasy this season and should be rostered in many more leagues. Sam Darnold , Seattle Seahawks (23.1%): Some fantasy managers just refuse to believe in Darnold despite his solid numbers. Darnold scored 20.0 points on Sunday against the Jacksonville Jaguars , and after a rough Week 1 outing, he is averaging nearly 20 PPG over his past five games. He and the Seahawks face the Houston Texans in Week 7. Given his numbers, it is hard to suggest anything but Darnold being underrated in fantasy. He showed us his ability last season with the Minnesota Vikings , and he is performing similarly this season. Deep-league options/streamers/random thoughts Although there is no shortage of veteran quarterbacks available for streaming in Week 7, the Jaguars' Trevor Lawrence (vs. LAR) and the Panthers' Bryce Young (at NYJ) do not have great matchups. So it is that we must recommend Pittsburgh Steelers starter Aaron Rodgers (13.7%) for a road game against the Cincinnati Bengals . The Bengals have not played great defense this season. Rodgers scored 17.5 points in Sunday's win over the Cleveland Browns , his best game since Week 1. The Arizona Cardinals ruled out Kyler Murray (foot) and started longtime backup Jacoby Brissett versus the Colts. Brissett (0.5%) scored 20.7 points, more than Murray has in any of his five games this season. We've seen Brissett fill in before with occasional success, but if Murray is out this week, there are surely better options since the Cardinals face the Green Bay Packers this week. If one is that desperate, note that new Bengals starter Joe Flacco scored 18.76 points in his debut. He faces the Steelers this week. Running back Kimani Vidal ended up being the replacement of choice with Omarion Hampton out in Week 6. Carmen Mandato/Getty Images Kimani Vidal , Los Angeles Chargers (27.1%): Someone had to pick up the running back duties with starter Omarion Hampton (ankle) shelved, and we had a good idea it would be some combination of Vidal and Hassan Haskins . Most sided with Haskins (49.7%), since he played at Michigan for Chargers coach Jim Harbaugh. Wrong choice! These coaches just keep everyone guessing! Vidal enjoyed a far greater performance, turning 21 touches into 138 yards and 22.8 points. Haskins had seven touches. Add Vidal for Week 7 against the Indianapolis Colts , while noting Hampton might miss more time than originally expected. Tyjae Spears , Tennessee Titans (23.6%): Spears (ankle) made his season debut in Week 5 with little statistical consequence. In Week 6, he turned nine touches into 50 yards and 9.0 points, outpacing starter Tony Pollard , who scored 6.7 points on 12 touches. The elusive Spears does his best work catching passes, and perhaps the Titans will use him even more in Week 7 against the Patriots. For now, Pollard investors have little to worry about. Bam Knight , Cardinals (5.6%): We featured Michael Carter in this space last week, as he appeared to be the Arizona running back of choice with James Conner and Trey Benson sidelined. On Saturday, a day before facing the Colts, rather surprising word came that the Cardinals intended to give Knight, with his third NFL organization before his 25th birthday, a chance at first-team volume. Knight scored a touchdown and notched 12.4 points on his 12 touches Sunday, but he didn't differentiate himself much from Carter, who scored 8.4 points on 11 touches. Knight is likely to be a bit overrated this week for the game against a tough Packers team. Deep-league options/streamers/random thoughts Steelers starter Jaylen Warren (knee) returned from a few weeks off and scored 8.3 points against the Browns. Meanwhile, Kenneth Gainwell (56.8%) caught six passes (though for only 14 yards), but his overall output was 9.6 points. This remains a timeshare, with Warren clearly the preferred choice. Although Gainwell has reached double-digit points in only one game, he continues to matter at a weak position in fantasy. The Vikings and Texans enjoyed the bye in Week 6, and all four of the running backs for these teams relevant to fantasy remain rostered in more than 50% of leagues. Still, check your league for Texans Nick Chubb (68.2%) and Woody Marks (59.7%), as they face the Seahawks this week. They still come preferred to Browns backups Jerome Ford (24.9%) and Dylan Sampson (14.3%), who combined for 12.4 points in Sunday's loss. Wide receiver play 1:26 What to make of the Patriots WR performance in Week 6 of fantasy Field Yates breaks down the surprising performance from Kayshon Boutte and DeMario Douglas in the Patriots' win over the Saints. Kayshon Boutte , Patriots (7.0%): Boutte was featured in this space after his solid Week 1 outing, in which he caught six passes for 103 yards against the Las Vegas Raiders . Then Boutte caught a measly seven passes for 105 yards over the next four games , making his opening-week output look mighty aberrant. Well, the rather inconsistent Boutte returned to relevance Sunday against the New Orleans Saints , catching all five of his targets for 93 yards and a pair of touchdowns. Does any of this mean Boutte will have a big Week 7 game against the Titans? Nope, but QB Drake Maye is terrific, and the Titans, well, are not. Pats teammate DeMario Douglas (6.7%) scored 16.1 points Sunday, and he also gets to face the Titans! Josh Downs , Colts (41.5%): Downs has reached double-digit points in three of six games so far. Those are the ones in which he has seven or more targets from resurgent QB Daniel Jones . In the other three games, Downs has not been targeted much, so he has not done much. We can't be sure Jones will target Downs this week against the Chargers, but at this point, fantasy managers need to trust Jones, and Downs feels a bit too available. In addition, the Colts face the Titans in Week 8. Deep-league options/streamers/random thoughts Harrison might not play in Week 7 against the Packers, which means more attention for Michael Wilson (3.9%), Zay Jones (0.1%) and Greg Dortch (0.2%). Yeah, it's not exactly a Hall of Fame crew for a Cardinals QB (to be named later) to throw to without Harrison (though TE Trey McBride might see 20 targets in Week 7). Jones scored 12.9 points in Sunday's loss, but Wilson has been involved in the offense all season, and he feels more likely to matter. Similarly, we do not know if Buccaneers rookie star Egbuka will be available to play on ""Monday Night Football"" against the Lions. Tez Johnson (0.0%), a rookie selected in the seventh round from Oregon, made the highlight reels with his 45-yard, fingertip touchdown, but it was his only catch Sunday. Kameron Johnson (0.0%) played more snaps and saw four targets, converting one into a touchdown. We recommend veteran Sterling Shepard (14.8%) first, then Kameron Johnson, but while Bucs head coach Todd Bowles already ruled out Chris Godwin Jr . and RB Bucky Irving out for Week 7, for all we know Egbuka, and Mike Evans (hamstring) could still play. It is early in the week, but make plans in case neither can go. San Francisco 49ers reserve Kendrick Bourne caught 10 passes for 142 yards while filling in for Ricky Pearsall and Jauan Jennings in Week 5, scoring a cool 24.2 points. He followed that up on Sunday with five catches for another 142 yards and a still-cool 19.2 points. Bourne, 29, has been around for a while and never surpassed 800 receiving yards in a season. At this rate of 142 yards per game, he would get there well before Thanksgiving. It is possible the 49ers QB (to be named later) will ignore Bourne when everyone else becomes healthy (including TE George Kittle ), but take a chance for Week 7 against the Falcons. Texans rookie Jayden Higgins (22.9%) caught five passes on six targets over the first four games of the season prior to the bye week, and then in Week 5 against the Ravens he caught four passes on as many targets. Perhaps star Nico Collins is the lone Texans WR worth relying on, but Higgins was a fantastic college player at Iowa State and a second-round draft pick. He should matter soon. Tight end Harold Fannin Jr ., Browns (29.1%): This isn't really an emerging passing game to invest in (yet), but Fannin caught 7 of 10 targets from fellow rookie Dillon Gabriel against the Steelers, and some of them came after starting TE David Njoku (knee) left early. Perhaps Njoku will miss some time. Fannin has scored double-digit points in three of six games, and the Browns face the Miami Dolphins in Week 7. Deep-league options/streamers/random thoughts Raiders star Brock Bowers (knee) has missed consecutive games, much to the chagrin of fantasy managers who expected another monster season. Backup Michael Mayer (3.1%) caught 5 of 7 targets for 50 yards and a touchdown on Sunday, his 16.0 points eclipsing any performance from Bowers this season. There will not be controversy for the Raiders, for Bowers is the starter when healthy, but Mayer is the only healthy one for this week. Seahawks starter AJ Barner (10.1%) continues to produce fantasy-relevant numbers, but managers continue to rely on underachievers such as Njoku and the Ravens' Mark Andrews . Barner scored 10.1 points against the Jaguars, the fourth time in five weeks he reached double digits. His is not major volume, and his touchdown rate is a bit high, but you can trust him in Week 7 and drop him for his bye in Week 8. Bye weeks: Keep these players rostered Bye weeks continue in Week 7 with the Buffalo Bills and Baltimore Ravens taking off. For the Bills, fantasy managers might wish to part with WRs Keon Coleman (75.5%) and Khalil Shakir (76.8%), along with TE Dalton Kincaid (78.7%). In each case, it would be more prudent to keep these players on your bench rather than dumping them for one-week fixes, if you can help it. This remains one of the top offenses in the league. Move on from the Bills D/ST (62.1%), though. The bye week comes at a good time for the struggling Ravens, who might get QB Lamar Jackson (hamstring) back for Week 8 against the Bears. Fantasy managers must keep RB Derrick Henry and WR Zay Flowers through the bye as well. That is not the case with veteran TE Mark Andrews (84.3%), who scored 6.6 points on Sunday and boasts more than half of his season total from one Week 3 game. Meanwhile, why is the Ravens D/ST (41.0%) still so popular? Only the Cowboys D/ST has been worse for fantasy! Defense/special teams Deep-league options/streamers/random thoughts The Browns continue to struggle to score points, so although the Dolphins don't exactly play awesome defense, the Miami D/ST (2.5%) unit appears to be a useful streamer for Week 7. The Giants D/ST (18.3%) scored 8.0 points in the victory over the Eagles, and it will face a Denver Broncos offense that scored only one touchdown in Week 6. The Giants have registered three or more sacks in half their games, and they create turnovers. Go with the Giants over the scuffling New York Jets (9.1%), who face the seemingly easier opponent in the Panthers. The Panthers have scored 57 points over the past two games and feature Dowdle and star rookie WR Tetairoa McMillan .",https://www.espn.com/fantasy/football/story/_/id/46584020/fantasy-football-free-agent-pickups-waiver-wire-nfl-week-7,Sport,BBC,,https://a4.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2025%2F1013%2Fr1559686_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg,,b46aca02b03b7691ec7e31ed1b303f5ed7da5725
a2db51e28983,Boxing divisional rankings: Jaron 'Boots' Ennis makes junior middleweight debut,,"A quiet weekend of boxing offered little movement in the divisional rankings. Jaron ""Boots"" Ennis made his formal debut at 154 pounds with a one-sided beatdown of Uisma Lima on Saturday in Philadelphia, delivering a warning shot to the rest of the division. Ennis dropped Lima twice in the first round before getting the stoppage at the 1:58 mark of the round. Although Lima wasn't much of a test for Ennis, the former unified welterweight champion's impressive performance was good enough for him to debut at No. 3 in ESPN's junior middleweight rankings. Yoenli Hernandez, ESPN's No. 8-ranked middleweight, picked up a first-round victory as he ran roughshod over journeyman Ramon De La Cruz Sena on Sunday in Florida in what was nothing more than a fight to stay busy. Hernandez sent Sena to the canvas with a body shot in the first minute of the fight, and Sena never had much of a chance. He made it to the end of the first round, but the fight was waved off before the start of Round 2. Hernandez stays at No. 8 and awaits a real challenge in his next fight. ESPN's divisional boxing rankings highlight the best in the sport in every weight class. Rankings will change based on recent results and performances. Fighters who have announced they are moving to a different weight class will be ranked in that new division, if warranted, only once they fight in that weight class. Fighters who currently own titles in two divisions can be ranked in both. Fighters who haven't competed in the past 12 months -- and don't have a fight scheduled -- will be dropped from the rankings until they fight again. Any fighter who tests positive for a performance-enhancing substance will also be removed. That boxer will be eligible to reenter the rankings after his next bout.

9b4275935f86,"Falcons' Robinson talks LeBron James X shoutout, connection after big night",,"ATLANTA -- Atlanta Falcons running back Bijan Robinson broke off an 81-yard touchdown run on ""Monday Night Football"" during his team's eventual 24-14 win over the Buffalo Bills at Mercedes-Benz Stadium. It was the longest rushing play anyone has had this season in the NFL. And it prompted a reaction from NBA great LeBron James of the Los Angeles Lakers . James posted a compliment on X, stating that Robinson is ""so cold."" Robinson said in his postgame news conference that his connection with James goes beyond just the social media shoutout. Robinson is represented by Nicole Lynn of Klutch Sports Group, an agency founded by James' longtime friend and agent Rich Paul, who is also Klutch's CEO. ""That's my dude,"" Robinson said of James after the victory. ""He gives me so much advice and just me being in the Klutch agency and seeing him and getting to talk to him and just enjoy the moments with him, man, it's always a blessing."" Robinson said the interactions he's had with James have been extra special, because the Lakers star is his ""favorite athlete."" James' last piece of advice to Robinson: ""To try [to] be the best in the league."" He's working on it. Robinson currently leads the NFL with 822 yards from scrimmage, despite him having played one fewer game than most other players due to the Falcons' early, Week 5 bye. On Monday, Robinson had a career-high 238 yards from scrimmage, including 170 yards rushing in a performance that made him an MVP candidate. ""I was like, 'Man, I'm going to keep trying every single time,'"" Robinson said of how he responded to James. ""And he was just saying, 'When you run the football like that, you make it enjoyable for me as a fan, as a spectator to watch.'"" Hoops was definitely on Robinson's mind Monday, as it normally is. Robinson takes inspiration from basketball players known for their ballhandling skills, like Allen Iverson and Dallas Mavericks guard Kyrie Irving . After the Bills game, Robinson compared his offensive line to when Stephen Curry gets hot -- the basket looks wide and the Golden State Warriors guard ""can't miss."" ""And when I find those creases, you got to take advantage of it and you got to make those guys miss tackles and make them not want to be there anymore,"" Robinson said . ""So that's what we did tonight."" The last time Robinson and James saw each other, Robinson said, was at the college football national championship game earlier this year when the two were playfully ""bickering."" Robinson played at Texas, and James is an Ohio State fan. The Buckeyes beat the Longhorns to make it to the title game. ""When I do get to see him and get to communicate with him, I am obviously like, 'Dang, that's LeBron James,'"" Robinson said. ""But it's all love at the end of the day.""",https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/46594875/bijan-robinson-lebron-james-atlanta-falcons-big-monday-night,Sport,BBC,,https://a1.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2025%2F1013%2Fr1559557_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg,,d65b08c6f169e15939918d462ff8b92b89f2db92
98d143250019,"Joe Mazzulla, Celtics coaches beat Celtics media 57-4 in pickup game",,"Media covering the Boston Celtics were supposed to play a pickup game among themselves at Boston's practice facility on Tuesday. Celtics coach Joe Mazzulla had other plans. The Celtics told reporters that they could use the Auerbach Center courts for a media game after practice. When asked about the game, Mazzulla shared news of a change. ""Don't want to break it to you, but you're not playing against each other. You're playing against the coaches,"" he told reporters. The game went exactly how one would anticipate it to go. Mazzulla and his staff dominated the 12-minute game, winning 57-4. Mazzulla's staff includes multiple former NBA players such as 6-foot-9 forward Amile Jefferson, guard Phil Pressey, 6-7 forward Da'Sean Butler, who is Mazulla's former college teammate, and God Shammgod. Mazzulla -- a four-year player at West Virginia -- suited up, too. Celtics stars Jaylen Brown and Jayson Tatum watched from above the practice court. ""It's hard to even describe what went down in the game. To describe it as a disaster for us reporters would be an understatement. The sheer gap in athleticism -- speed, size, instincts, you name it -- felt so insurmountable that I can hardly pinpoint what even went down,"" Celtics on CNLS reporter Noa Dalzell wrote .

14e95cc6e93e,"First bets for Week 7: The Bucs' run stops here, Giants cover in Denver",,"Oct 13, 2025, 02:05 PM ET Week 7 gets underway with a matchup of AFC North rivals, as the Pittsburgh Steelers visit the Cincinnati Bengals on ""Thursday Night Football."" Sunday's slate begins with the Los Angeles Rams and Jacksonville Jaguars meeting at Wembley Stadium in London, and the Indianapolis Colts visiting the Los Angeles Chargers highlights the late afternoon window of games. The Tampa Bay Buccaneers and Detroit Lions get together in a battle of offensive juggernauts to kick off a ""Monday Night Football"" doubleheader, and the night wraps up with the Houston Texans visiting the Seattle Seahawks . Eric Karabell, Pamela Maldonado, Matt Bowen, Eric Moody, Joe Fortenbaugh and Seth Walder looked at the early Week 7 odds and identified which ones are worth jumping on now before potential shifts later in the week. Note: Odds at time of publication, courtesy of ESPN BET Sportsbook Bowen: Cleveland is averaging only 13.7 PPG this season, the second fewest in the league. And when you watch the Browns on tape, with Dillon Gabriel at quarterback, they aren't built to create explosive plays at a high rate. This feels like a game (based on the matchup) where rookie running back Quinshon Judkins is featured. Control tempo while leaning on your defense to limit Tua Tagovailoa and the Miami pass game. The game is in Cleveland, too. Take the under. Last week: Buccaneers -2.5 vs. 49ers (Buccaneers won, 30-19) Fortenbaugh: This luckbox Buccaneers run is coming to a screeching halt at some point in the near future, so we might as well lean into the projected regression with a Lions team playing at home off a loss. Tampa Bay is now 5-1 on the season with a point differential of +14. To put that into perspective, the Seahawks are 4-2 with a point differential of +49 and the Texans are 2-3 with a point differential of +47. Throw in the myriad injuries to the Tampa receiving unit and you've got Detroit covering the 4.5 and restoring order to the NFC. Last week: Steelers -4.5 vs. Browns (Steelers won, 23-9) Karabell: Let's stop a bit short of expecting Joe Flacco and the Bengals to win the game, but it is a home game against a heated rival on a short week, and the addition of Flacco does change things. It's not like Pittsburgh's QB is some young fellow. Flacco should keep this game close in the fourth quarter, at the least. I would not take the Steelers in pools. This is a field goal game at the end. Last week: Ravens-Rams over 45.5 (Rams won, 17-3) Maldonado: The Giants are quietly figuring it out with Jaxson Dart . You can feel the shift. They finally have an identity. Run the ball, control the clock, make the other team uncomfortable. Dart isn't putting up video game numbers, but he's doing exactly what this offense needs: extending plays. The defense is starting to look nasty too, especially up front with Brian Burns and Kayvon Thibodeaux collapsing pockets. It's not flashy, but it's effective. Going into Denver, this feels like another one of those ugly, grind-it-out games. The Giants are now built for that. Last week: Eagles-Giants under 42 (Giants won, 34-17) All of ESPN. All in one place. Watch your favorite events in the newly enhanced ESPN App. Learn more about what plan is right for you. Sign Up Now Moody: The Panthers have won two straight and scored 27 or more points in three of their last four games. Rico Dowdle erupted for 234 total yards two weeks ago and piled on 239 more in a Week 6 win over Dallas, and Carolina's defense shut down Javonte Williams and Cowboys' running game. The Jets, meanwhile, managed just 82 total yards against the Broncos in London, the third-lowest single-game total in franchise history. With momentum on their side and New York reeling, this is a great spot to back Carolina. The Panthers are 4-1 against the spread in their last five games. Last week: 49ers +2.5 at Buccaneers (Buccaneers won, 30-19) Walder: I'll be the first one to say throw out any historical stats about how often 1-5 teams make the playoffs when it comes to the 2025 Ravens. Most 1-5 teams are simply bad, and despite whatever we have seen from Baltimore thus far, I don't think anyone expects that this is a bad team going forward. And almost none of those teams have a perennial MVP candidate like Lamar Jackson , either. And rarely have those teams faced the hardest schedule in the NFL (as the Ravens have) and will face the 27th-hardest schedule going forward (as the Ravens will). It's because all of that that I was perfectly prepared to argue for Baltimore's chances to make the playoffs -- and then I saw the odds. The 1-5 Ravens are even money to miss the playoffs? They certainly could come back, but 50/50? That surprised me, and it certainly would shock FPI. The model, which assumes Jackson returns after the team's Week 7 bye, gives the Ravens only a 25% chance to make the playoffs. The Ravens will need a lot to go their way to play playoff football again. Last week: Steelers -4.5 vs. Browns (Steelers won, 23-9)",https://www.espn.com/espn/betting/story/_/id/46509824/2025-nfl-week-7-games-betting-odds-props-early-pick-predictions-first-bet,Sport,BBC,,https://a3.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2025%2F1014%2Fr1559648_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg,,38da513cd5f92f9b52d8a18c69bf158e6c05c20a
90906403a20a,Fantasy,,"Oct 14, 2025, 08:27 AM ET The ESPN fantasy basketball experts got together for another mock draft, using a 10-team head-to-head points format, with only a week to go before the NBA season tips off on Oct. 21. If you're new to fantasy hoops and looking to try it out for the first time, here is a tutorial of all the basics . From there, it's easy to grab a handful of people, set up a draft and have some fun! Before that, though, it's always smart to spend a little time preparing with a mock draft of your own. For this expert mock draft, pay close attention to how everything unfolded, as your draft could take on a very similar look.

a0a6eb90abbd,"Transfer rumors, news: Neymar eyeing shock return to Europe",,"Oct 14, 2025, 10:00 AM ET Neymar could be set for a return to Europe in Serie A , while Arsenal , Manchester City and Real Madrid are among the clubs eyeing Eintracht Frankfurt left back Nathaniel Brown . Join us for the latest transfer news and rumors from around the globe. Transfers homepage | Done deals | Men's grades | Women's grades TOP STORIES - Sources: Utd may extend Casemiro but salary key - De Jong signs new Barcelona contract until 2029 - Sources: Barça, Madrid tracking Mexican teen Mora Neymar became the world's most expensive player when he moved from Barcelona and Paris Saint-Germain. Could he now return to Europe on a free transfer? Alexandre Schneider/Getty Images TRENDING RUMORS - Santos forward Neymar is open to a move to Serie A amid links to Inter Milan and Napoli , according to Fabrizio Romano . The 33-year-old is set to become a free agent at the end of the year, and could return to Europe where he spent a decade at Barcelona and Paris Saint-Germain . Amid hopes of impressing Brazil senior national team manager Carlo Ancelotti and gaining a recall to the national team ahead of next year's FIFA World Cup , it is reported that Neymar would be keen to a move to either of the two clubs in Italy. Neymar, who has also recently been linked with MLS club Inter Miami , was previously offered to the Nerazzurri in the summer. - Multiple clubs in Europe are interested in Eintracht Frankfurt left back Nathaniel Brown , Bild reports. Real Madrid, Arsenal, and Manchester City are all keen on the 22-year-old following a number of impressive performances this season, while he has also been linked with AC Milan . According to Florian Plettenberg , the Bundesliga club are aware of interest in Brown's signature, and they are expected to demand an offer worth at least €60 million before agreeing to part ways with him. - AS Roma are in the race for Manchester United striker Joshua Zirkzee , reports The Sun . The Serie A club are said to be lining up a move in January for the 24-year-old, who they see as a potential loan option to reinforce their forward line. Zirkzee, who is yet to start a match for the Red Devils this season, has been linked with several clubs in Italy, where he spent two seasons at Bologna before moving to Old Trafford. Sources told ESPN last week that United are set to hold talks with the Netherlands international ahead of the January transfer window. - Liverpool are ready to make a U-turn regarding their stance on winger Federico Chiesa , according to Football Insider . Chiesa, 27, was previously linked with a potential exit from Anfield during the summer amid interest from Serie A, but the latest indicates that the Reds now see him as an important part of manager Arne Slot's side, and they have no interest in listening to offers for him during the January transfer window. He has been one of the standouts for his side this season, having directly contributed to four goals in 153 minutes across six appearances. - A move for Fenerbahce and Slovakia international defender Milan Skriniar is being weighed up by Juventus , according to Gazzetta dello Sport . The 30-year-old is reportedly one of the top names on the Bianconeri's shortlist as they look to sign cover for starter Gleison Bremer , who is expected to be out for a considerable amount of time after suffering a torn meniscus in the Serie A match with Atalanta . It is said that they could also consider a deal for Bayern Munich 's Kim Min-Jae , 28, but his non-EU status would be a potential obstacle.

3f75ac6ba44d,This Small Town Protected a Predator. Now His Survivors Are Fighting Back,,"I t seemed like any city council meeting: a beige, cinderblock room, metal chairs, a U-shaped table with a maroon tablecloth reading “Leonia Board of Education.” But for the men — some sporting matching T-shirts, claiming that they were survivors of sexual abuse at the hands of a once-beloved teacher — it signified a release, a silence broken. Paul King, 59, choked back sobs as he took the mic, his family thronged behind him on a school lunch table bench. “I hope that none of you have ever experienced sexual assault ,” he said in measured tones, despite the emotion. “So what do I want? That’s a good question. I don’t know. But I do know that I want what’s fair. I want the people that are victims to be free to come out. To heal. … There’s a saying that a crisis is a terrible thing to waste. This crisis has been going on for over 50 years.” “That was like the most I’ve ever seen him cry in my life,” King’s 24-year-old son, also named Paul, later tells me. He sat behind his father during his speech, nodding emphatically. “He was reaching really deep down into his memories, into his darkest, repressed stuff, to figure out what happened to him and convey it in a way that was more digestible for these guys sitting on the council.” Nearly half a century ago, King and his fellow survivors saw their idyllic enclave of Leonia, New Jersey , turn into a hostile place. A leafy, close-knit community less than 10 miles from New York City, Leonia isn’t that kind place where tragedy often happens — in fact, it was the model for the suburban utopia depicted in Disney’s WandaVision . But, much like in that show, there was unease beneath the surface: back in the Eighties, King and the rest watched as their beloved hometown rallied around elementary school teacher John Anagnosti, a.k.a. Mr. A — despite the fact that Mr. A was convicted of abusing one of their fellow students. It was a stunning state of affairs: a young boy’s pain dismissed, his abuser given a slap on the wrist and thousands of dollars of legal support from local parents. Now, though, due to expanding statutes of limitations on child sexual abuse cases, more and more of those who say they are Mr. A’s victims are coming forward, including two brothers who sued the school board, settling for a combined $6 million. As one of the plaintiff’s attorneys claims, more than a dozen survivors could be coming forward in the coming weeks — alleged victims of abuse that reportedly spanned nearly 15 years. And his supporters? Some have apologized to survivors; others are now silent. AT 66, MICHAEL GONZALES RESEMBLES a svelte Santa Claus, wiry and strong. But back in the 1970s, he was an eight-year-old with a high and tight haircut and a mischievous smile — a Dennis the Menace incarnate. He also believes he was likely Mr. A’s first victim. Joe and Mike Gonzales both say they were victims of Mr. A. Courtesy of the Gonzalez Family At the time, unconventional teaching was all the rage: field trips, dinners at teachers’ houses, ballgames — anything to get fidgety, bored students engaged. Mr. A embraced that educational style, even earning him a glowing piece in the local paper in 1971 about a class trip to dig fossils with a Columbia University professor. ”I spend so many hours with the kids outside the classroom because that’s when I truly get to see them as human beings,” he later told The New York Times . ”They’re more open then. I feel that if I get to know them, I can help them.” Unfortunately, it seems, those outings also allowed Mr. A unfettered access to his alleged victims, like Gonzales. “The bell rings for lunch, and he would put his arm out to prevent me from going out the classroom door, and that’s when the molestation started,” Gonzales says. He says Mr. A molested him until seventh grade, roughly 500 times, a claim also included in his lawsuit against the school board. “All the kids are out in the school yard playing, and I’m here being molested. That same scenario over and over again, but not just in the classroom…. That all started with me; that was his plan on how he gathered the kids. That was his master plan.” Gonzales’ brother, Joe, also says he became one of Mr. A’s victims at age six, when Michael went by the teacher’s house to rake leaves with his brother in tow. Michael didn’t find out until years later, but the experience nearly ruined both of the brothers’ lives. “I became a bully. I ruined friendships,” Michael says. “I came out of high school and I didn’t know how to read, because I couldn’t concentrate.” Joe, 60, turned to drinking at age 12; he was 35 days sober when we spoke. “I wasn’t born an alcoholic,” he says. “I was born a normal kid that was abused at five, six years old, and alcohol, it was a savior, and it is the love of my life.” The brothers’ pain only intensified in January of 1981, when an elementary school student publicly accused Mr. A of molestation. “I carried around that burden,” Michael says, his voice breaking. “Why didn’t I say something? It’s not what he did to me. These kids [that he may have abused], who knows if they’re even alive…. It’s just a total failure of humanity.” It didn’t help that the people of Leonia seemed firmly on Mr. A’s side back in 1981. When the child’s father paraded through the town center with a sign proclaiming the teacher’s guilt — then took the pulpit at the Presbyterian Church to do the same — he was charged with harassment, and endangering his child by keeping him out of school, and ordered to undergo a psychiatric evaluation, according to The New York Times . Mr. A wasn’t completely able to escape consequences. In spring of that year , following an investigation he was charged with molesting the student, pleaded guilty, and resigned. Still, by June, he’d changed his tune — especially after local parents had raised $7,500 for his defense. Mr. A then opted to retract his plea, claiming that he’d only fessed up to the crime to spare the child “emotional trauma.” The case then moved to state Superior Court, and in 1982, he was convicted of sexual assault. It may seem strange in 2025 that Leonia would stand by an alleged child abuser, but even the headlines of the day reflect a different time: “Leonia Parents Support Teacher in Morals Case,” trumpets one, while another article, titled “Supporting a Neighbor,” casts a benefit dinner at All Saints Episcopal Church as a heartwarming communion in support of a beloved educator. ”When Mr. A resigned,” one child said, according to the paper, “we got a teacher who just told us what to do and sat there. Mr. A said it was better to learn by experiencing things. We went to New York to the planetarium, to the World Trade Center, to the Statue of Liberty and other places. The class would go to his house for dinner and talk about what we’d seen.” According to the the Times, the local TV shop even put up an open letter from Mr. A thanking the town for its support — a sore point for Joe, who worked at the store. Paul King had to walk by that poster every day on his walk to school, silently seething. “Joe told me, ‘Every time I walked into that TV [store], I look at that effing poster,” he says. “I’m thinking, ‘I’ve been abused for over two years by this guy, like big time.’…It wasn’t, ‘You show me your weenie and I’ll show you mine,’ it was full-on physical touching and beyond.’ But nobody believed the kid.” King has not filed a suit. Michael was similarly enraged by the support. He was on leave from the Army when he heard the news of Mr. A’s conviction, and wracked with guilt and shame (and alcohol), he went to the man’s house with the intention of killing him. Mr. A let him into his condo, and after calling his lawyer or psychiatrist — Michael isn’t sure which — Michael changed his mind. “You know, it tortures me,” he says. “I could have went to jail. I could have ruined my whole life.” Even after Mr. A was convicted of sexual assault, the judgment was muted. He received only three years of probation and a $25 fine. “I don’t know what other punishment this man deserves,” the judge opined at the time, while Mr. A took the stand to tell the court: “I would rather cut off my right hand than harm a hair on a child. My love for children is genuine.” It’s not all that surprising, then, that Leonia received a glowing write-up in the infamous pedophile magazine, Pan, an underground publication about “boy love.” “He was indicted by a grand jury in October. But instead of running him out of town, as, sadly, often happens in such cases, the community rallied to his support,” the magazine said. “It must have occurred to more than one of the good parents at the All Saints Episcopal Church: John Anagnosti is a paedophile in the true sense of the word; he loves children, and whether or not there is a sexual expression of this love would not seem to be very important.” MR. A DIED IN 2020, BUT THE MEN never forgot him — or what he did. And, at the time, they suffered in silence, since neither King nor the Gonzaleses knew that they shared the same abuser. “I had lost my hope,” Michael says. “I’m going to the grave with the secret. …I’m laying in bed, and I see this commercial on TV, and it says if you were molested by a teacher in New Jersey or something or another, to call this number. I called the number.” The law firm from the commercial then connected Michael with Baldante & Rubenstein, which has seen a massive uptick in such cases since New Jersey, along with several other states, changed its statute of limitations for child sexual abuse survivors in 2019. Now, Michael and his brother could fight back. “When you sit down with these victims and they start to tell their story, oftentimes we’re the first person they’ve ever spoken to about it,” lawyer John Baldante says. He adds that 80 to 90 percent of their cases deal with sexual abuse cases. “They start crying like the eight- and 10-year old-children that they were when they were abused. … One of my clients once said, ‘It’s the first time I’ve ever spoken out on behalf of that 10-year-old version of myself.’” With Baldante’s help, Joe and Michael each sued the Leonia Township Board of Education, alleging that the school and board knew about Mr. A’s reported actions, but did nothing to stop them. “Despite such knowledge,” Michael’s suit reads, “[the school] failed to adequately respond to stop harassment…against the plaintiff.” The brothers garnered a combined $6 million in separate settlements in 2024. Still, according to Michael’s daughter, Keegan, “this lawsuit wasn’t a payday. It was acknowledgement that something horrific happened, and the school system failed these kids. The story does not end here. We’re going to continue speaking about this, because this goes beyond compensation. We want people’s stories to be heard.” To date, Baldante says several other men have come forward with similar stories about Mr. A, and he expects there will be many more. The firm is in the process of working up further litigation. “There’s no question that there’s undoubtedly hundreds [of victims],” he claims. “Mr. A was the Pied Piper.” Although stressing that there are only three cases of litigation currently pending against the teacher and school board, Baldante says “in the context of cases against a single perpetrator within a public school Board of Education, the claims against Mr. A are evolving into one of the largest clusters of claims.” AND THAT BRINGS US BACK TO THAT city council meeting. Through a series of happenstances, Keegan met the younger Paul King, and they figured out that both their fathers claim to have been victims of Mr. A — right before the Gonzaleses and another alleged survivor, Daniel Schlademan, were due to speak at the meeting on June 17. In light of more and more alleged victims coming forward, the men planned to address the Board of Education, calling on them to take steps to bring closure and comfort to the victims, as well as concrete moves to ensure the safety of the town’s children in the future. Daniel Schlademan created a website so Mr. A’s victims could come forward. Courtesy of Dan Schlademan King joined them, and, one by one, they emptied their hearts in that ugly municipal board room. The men acknowledged that the school board is populated by far different people than it was 50 years ago, but they still want justice — and recognition of systemic failure. “The Leonia school district dismissed the reports of sexual abuse made by students and tried to sweep Anagnosti’s predatory conduct under the carpet,” says the lawyer, Baldante. “Unfortunately, these efforts by Leonia only compounded the problem.” “The Leonia School District is currently involved in active litigation related to these matters, and therefore we cannot provide specific comments,” said Daniel Lee, President of Leonia Board of Education. “That said, our lack of direct response to the public comments on this matter must not be mistaken for indifference to the pleas of those who have come forward. We recognize how painful these issues may be for victims, their families, and the wider community. We take this concern very seriously. The Board’s goal is always to foster a safe, supportive environment, and we are mindful of the role we can play in the healing process. At this moment, however, our legal and ethical responsibilities require restraint to avoid jeopardizing the district or those it serves now and in the future.” In a 2022 filing, the BOE denied “any wrongdoing or negligence,” adding: “The Board did not have actual or constructive knowledge of the allegations of sexual misconduct of Defendant John Anagnosti. The Board did not enable any alleged sexual abuse and the Board did not fail to take action with regards to any alleged sexual abuse.” Now, all the men can do is wait. Wait for the school board to listen to them. Wait for more people to come forward. Schlademan created a website in May outlining the town’s history with Mr. A called Voices of Leonia ; he’s currently fighting his own legal battle against the school board and declined to be interviewed for this article. Meanwhile, Baldante is interviewing more survivors of Mr. A in preparation for future lawsuits. And the Gonzaleses? They’re just continuing to heal. “It’s so important to me that this story is told,” Michael says. “Everybody’s at fault here — full circle. I’ve been disappointed so many times. This guy is a monster and nobody paid attention.”",https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-features/teacher-sexual-assault-new-jersey-lawsuit-1235446051,Entertainment,BBC,Brenna Ehrlich,https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Leonia-NJ-Pedophile-teacher_FINAL.jpg?w=1600&h=900&crop=1,2025-10-15T00:00:00+00:00,349292459e8ca46004b7f6c039015cbbe299bbd5
22f146345c0c,‘Pokémon Legends: Z-A’ Is a Middling Evolution for a Franchise in Need of Saving,,"The world’s biggest media franchise has been evolving. Since transitioning to 3D graphics with Pokémon X and Y (2013), the mainline series had stumbled through a period of stagnation — their eight gyms, each tackled in a specific order ending up in a showdown with the elite four, has become stale to fans. Pokémon Legends: Z-A (out Oct. 16), a sequel to X and Y , is the third of a few attempts to shake things up, following Pokémon Scarlet and Violet (2022) and Pokémon Legends: Arceus (2022). The Nintendo Switch era has been turbulent for the franchise, to put it mildly. Fan frustration finds a new target with each new release, whether it was the bland and forgettable nature of Sword and Shield (2019), the poor technical performance of Legends: Arceus or the unforgivable buggy mess that Scarlet and Violet were upon release. For the developers at Game Freak, their greatest achievement would be not providing fans with a comically large stick to beat the latest entry with. Boasting a brand new battle system and a compelling alternative to the gym challenge, Legends: Z-A succeeds at making a Pokémon game with its own flavor, but frustratingly stumbles over some familiar hurdles. The dream of a modern Pokémon experience we can call great without heavy qualification remains elusive. Throwing Chaos into the Pokémon Battle Much like its predecessor in the Legends sub-series, Z-A looks to redefine the Pokémon battle. Arceus took the route of allowing the player to manipulate the order of the turn-based combat, something that had operated on a strict “their turn, my turn” basis in the mainline games. This allowed for more dynamic clashes, aided by compelling, unique animations. Z-A takes the dynamism of its battles to the extreme, discarding the turn-based nature of it entirely and opting for fast and chaotic action, a shift that longtime fans will take a bit of time to adapt to. There are no turns, it’s about getting as many attacks off as possible and draining the opponent’s health points (HP) before they can land a fatal blow. The first few battles are a disorienting experience. Before the player can figure out how to even select their attacks, the opponent has removed a chunk of their HP through a move that could burst flames, water or psychic energy across the screen. It’s impossible to know where to look. Pokémon muscle memory will have experienced gamers take some time to pick a move and watch their partner execute it. Real-time battles can be chaotic and require recalibrating how the player approaches combat. Nintendo; The Pokémon Company In Z-A , by the time that process is complete, the Pokémon’s HP could be halved and attack power weakened. Keeping track of what both Pokémon are doing, each of their health bars, the animations for each attack and the battle log (which shows whether or not attacks have landed) takes a long time to get used to. It may take a few hours of playtime but when this action-based battle system clicks, it feels amazing to play out. Not only does the player start to understand where to look and when, but they’ll start to see the depth of strategy in the game. Z-A splits moves into short range and long range attacks. To execute the move Tackle, the Pokémon will have to go right up to its opponent to deliver the blow, leaving it at risk of being countered immediately. On the other hand, Hyper Beam can deliver its might from far enough that the opponent will have to reposition themselves before attacking. Balancing things are cooldown times, meaning Tackle can be used every four seconds, but Hyper Beam will take 12 seconds before it can be used again. The player is forced to make risk-reward judgments on the fly, which is especially stressful in battles with Rogue Mega Evolved Pokémon as well as Alpha Pokémon. The latter is a concept taken from Legends: Arceus describing huge Pokémon that have gone wild and aim their attacks at the trainer instead of their Pokémon. The same goes for Rogue Megas, except they take on an enhanced form, specialized to each Pokémon species, as introduced as the main gimmick in Pokémon X and Y . Having these giant beasts run straight past the Pokémon they should be fighting and directly at the player character (whose outfit they spent a lot of in-game money on) can be used to their advantage. Because of how much enemy Pokémon move around in Z-A , it’s very common for long range attacks to miss, almost like setting up a cannon to fire at a moving target. But by drawing the enemy Pokémon to the trainer, it gives the partner Pokémon a steady target to unleash its Flamethrower or Ice Beam at. Z-A Royale takes over the city each night with new trainers to face. Nintendo; The Pokémon Company Mastery over battles will see trainers speed up the ranks of the Z-A Royale, a tournament unique to Lumiose City (where the entire game is played). The Z-A Royale stands in for the gym challenge and offers a fun, refreshing alternative. Every night the city is bathed in neon red as a purge-like event begins. Trainers will spot the main character in the street and begin battles on the fly, desperate to achieve A Rank and shape Lumiose in whichever sick and twisted way they want. Players skilled at raising strong Pokémon (or farming Rare Candies) should hardly have trouble clearing every battle they come across in Lumiose, which is why the Z-A Royale includes Bonus Cards. Tasks like “Sneak up on an opponent using only Flying-type moves,” or “Only defeat opponents with a higher rank than you,” offer bonus points that can help the protagonist get to the next rank more quickly. It remains engaging and exciting almost every time dusk falls over the city, whether the player is participating in the Royale or just trying to get on with whichever side quest they’re preoccupied with. A Walkable Open World Z-A follows the tradition set by Arceus and continued by Scarlet and Violet by being another open world game, but its approach to the genre differs from the industry standard in one significant way — traversal. In many open world games, Pokémon included, the protagonist gains different modes of traversal as they go along. In The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild , Link can paraglide and ride a horse. In Marvel’s Spider-Man 2 , Peter Parker and Miles Morales can run, swing, or wind-glide through New York. In Legends: Z-A , the only way to get around (other than fast travel) is to walk. Lumiose City is self-contained but doesn’t provide much reason to explore on foot. Nintendo; The Pokémon Company Being set in a single city means that the world isn’t so expansive that it would be a massive chore to walk everywhere, and Game Freak’s intention is for the player to get distracted on their way by a side quest or an item or a Pokémon to catch. As underwhelming Lumiose ends up being when measured against the expectation of a bustling metropolis like that of Pokémon Black and White’ s Castelia City, there is never a shortage of things to do in between main missions. However, with the load times being as short as they are on Switch 2 , it always feels more convenient to fast-travel past them, which is a failure of open world design. Fast travel is an option in Marvel’s Spider-Man , but nobody wants to miss out on how good it feels to swing through New York, even if their destination is on the other side of the map. The visceral feeling of it is what puts gamers in the shoes of the main character, clicking a button and appearing in a different region can break the immersion. The greatest asset of Z-A ’s open world are the Wild Zones, areas where the untamed Pokémon of Lumiose are cornered off in an attempt to craft a city where both species can co-exist. Wild Zones are time sinks, places where hours can be drained away, their greatness owed to a mechanic ripped straight from Arceus where catching Pokémon feels like landing consecutive headshots in Call of Duty . The same trigger the player would use to shoot a gun is used to throw Poké Balls at unsuspecting monsters, and there’s never been a mechanic in a Pokémon game that feels as immersive. It’s not unique to Z-A , but the game is stronger for including it. Wild Zones are the only areas where Pokémon can be caught naturally (by pelting them in the head). Nintendo; The Pokémon Company Many of Z-A ’s weaker moments have to do with its visuals, something the series has never gotten right since going 3D. While Arceus was a cool interpretation of an ancient world, shooting for a grainy, chalky style, Z-A has no real visual flare to speak of. It’s a game that looks to present information rather than do anything truly inspiring. Z-A never drifts into the realm of unbearable bugs as Scarlet and Violet did (on Switch 2 anyway), the worst offenders being the odd jittery animation in the distance and some noticeable pop-in. The lack of voice acting is another old problem that rears its head here, cut scenes depict characters awkwardly flapping their mouths to complete silence, robbing the plot of whatever drama it has. Nintendo fans have gotten used to the company’s other flagship franchises like Mario , Zelda , and Donkey Kong reaching euphoric heights during the Switch era and are looking to Game Freak to deliver the same. There’s an expectation that a cash magnet as large as Pokémon could invest more in making bolder and more exciting games, but that popularity is its prison. Pokémon ’s power comes from constantly being in the zeitgeist with a new product out regularly, conditions anathema to innovation. Evolution is incremental and Legends: Z-A is as significant as those increments can be within the confines of Game Freak’s condensed release schedule. It builds an exciting new battle system, maintains a dynamic gameplay loop and expands the lore around a beloved part of the universe. This will be enough to top the eshop charts, sell out stores and recover some of the reputation damage from Scarlet and Violet’ s botched launch. However, it remains to be seen whether or not Game Freak is capable of delivering a complete package. At this point, the Pokémon franchise remains one still desperately in need of saving.

c3a13f598a96,Barack Obama Offers Marc Maron Political and Professional Advice on ‘WTF’ Finale,,"Marc Maron has dropped the 1,686th and final episode of his long-running WTF podcast, with former President Barack Obama returning for Maron’s last interview. Maron managed to keep the identity of his last guest a secret until the episode dropped Monday morning, Oct. 13. In introducing Obama — who famously appeared on the show 10 years ago — Maron described him as the perfect person to help him bring WTF to a close. As Maron said in his intro: “I do a lot of talking about how I feel about the world , both interior and exterior; micro, macro; what’s going on in me, how am I reacting to what’s going on in the world. And it became clear that the guest we needed to have was singular. In that he could address the importance of this being our final episode, but also address how we move through the world we’re living in, as frightening as it is, with what’s happening. And how do we do it with some grace, and perhaps some hope and some focus, and really call what’s going on what it is. And that guest is President Barack Obama.” While Obama came to Maron’s house for their 2015 chat, this time Maron visited the former president at his office in Washington, D.C. During the conversation, the pair spoke at length about Trump, the state of the Democratic Party, the weaponization of the justice system, and prominent institutions like universities and law firms kowtowing to the current administration. “We have blown through, just in the last six months, a whole range of not simply assumptions, but rules and laws and practices that were put in place to ensure that nobody is above the law, and that we don’t use the federal government to simply reward our friends and punish our enemies,” Obama said. He added that “people are right to be concerned,” but said that just like during the McCarthy era and at other contentious points in American history, “What’s required in these situations is a few folks standing up and giving courage to other folks. And then more people stand up and go like, ‘Yeah, no, that’s not who we are. That’s not our idea of America.’” Maron also took the opportunity to ask Obama for some advice — not just on how to navigate this moment politically, but also personally. He asked the former president how he contended with the weight of leaving his biggest job ever, with Obama recalling some advice he got at the time: “Don’t rush into what the next thing is.” He continued, “Take a beat and take some satisfaction. Looking back and saying, ‘You know what, didn’t get everything done that I wanted; it wasn’t always exactly how I planned it, but there’s a body of work there that I’m proud of.’” Following the interview, Maron said he hoped the interview was “helpful,” while also calling it an “honor” to interview Obama again. He then signed off for the last time, thanking fans for all their support, the numerous people who’d helped him put on the show, and, lastly, his beloved cats, especially all those who’d passed away. “Cat angels everywhere,” Maron said as the show drew to a close.",https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-news/barack-obama-wtf-last-episode-barack-obama-interview-1235445889,Entertainment,BBC,Jon Blistein,https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/GettyImages-2188444363.jpg?w=1600&h=900&crop=1,2025-10-13T14:15:45+00:00,c18ffbcd0bbf7d5f60474b90f79e74c001c7ba40
b48bea4c9b21,7 Podcasts to Listen to After Watching ‘Monster: The Ed Gein Story’,,"7 Podcasts to Listen to After Watching ‘Monster: The Ed Gein Story’ From deep dives into the notorious killer to explorations of Psycho and the Holocaust, learn the real history behind Ryan Murphy’s Netflix hit Producer Ryan Murphy loves to blur the line between fact and fiction , and there’s no shortage of that in his most recent entry, Monster: The Ed Gein Story . Ostensibly, the eight-part Netflix show is about Gein (played by Charlie Hunnam), a small-town Wisconsin farmer who was discovered in 1957 to have killed at least two women, grave-robbed several others, and used their remains to make grotesque clothing and decor for his home. His story became national news, and even after he was sent to an institution for the criminally insane for the rest of his life, it inspired young writers and filmmakers to create the archetype for modern horror: the monster hidden among us. In Monster , Murphy explores this idea by including dramatized scenes of the making of some of these films, including Psycho, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, and Silence of the Lambs . He also includes the fantasies Gein might have had about Ilse Koch, a Nazi who was accused of using the skin of her death camp victims to make lampshades and bind books. And like any good true crime series, the show leaves viewers wanting to know more. So, instead of spending hours scrolling and searching the web, we’ve curated seven podcasts that delve into the stories explored in Monster: The Ed Gein Story. The Compendium Podcast: Ed Gein: Monster, Murderer, and the Real Story Behind Hollywood’s Nightmares For a story like that of Ed Gein, whose crimes have become so deeply ingrained in American culture that they can sometimes be hard to see, it’s beneficial to have an outsider’s perspective. The Compendium Podcast is a little newer than a lot of the podcasts on this list — it launched in 2023 — but it’s done a good job establishing itself among a growing number of nerdy British buddy podcasts (check out The Rest Is History if you want the OG) by publishing well researched deep dives on everything from Ocean Gate and Heavens Gate to Princess Diana and Roald Dahl. In this episode, co-host Adam Cox walks the listener through the story, while co-host Kyle Risi offers reactions on Gein, his crimes, and the films he inspired. Last Podcast on the Left: Ed Gein Last Podcast on the Left is one of the longest-running comedy-true crime shows out there (quite possibly the only one). The hosts’ casual rapport can sometimes feel at odds with the seriousness of the crimes that they’re discussing, but the schtick of the show — one friend explaining a crime to a group of friends, a now-common premise they helped establish back in 2011 — works well with a crime like Gein’s, where there’s so much myth and rumor to discuss. Some points in this three-part series can feel a little dated (it was made in 2015, after all), but overall, it’s a detailed, deep dive into a complicated subject made by a group of podcasters at the top of their game. You’re Wrong About: Ed Gein and Slasher Movies For this episode of the excellent series You’re Wrong About , co-hosts Sarah Marshall and Michael Hobbes not only give a nice dive into Gein’s story, but use it as a jumping-off point to discuss horror cinema. Going down the rabbit hole on topics like America’s mid-century obsession with Freud, how 1970s horror films reflected changing opinions of the Vietnam War, and the transphobic message at the heart of Silence of the Lambs , it opens up new lines of thought in Monster ’s other story: that of Gein’s affect on American art. (If you’re curious about the themes explored in Monster ’s final episode, you might also check out Y ou’re Wrong About: Mindhunting where Marshall dives into the world of criminal profiling.) Unspooled: Psycho Unspooled , hosted by actor Paul Scheer ( The League, Black Monday ) and L.A. Times film critic Amy Nicholson, launched in 2018, initially working its way through the American Film Institute’s 100 best films of all time. Though they’ve long since branched out, on that original list was Psycho , clocking in at number 14. In this episode, Scheer and Nicholson only briefly touch on Gein himself, instead focusing more on a critical exploration of the film. But their discussions of the film — along with an interview with Alexandre O. Philippe, director of 78/52: Hitchcock’s Shower Scene , a documentary entirely about that cinematic murder — reveal how important this work was in the history of film. Inside Psycho Wonder’s eight-part series Inside Psycho, which came out in 2017, follows the formula of a lot of that podcast production company’s early shows: Told chronologically, with a cinematic, omnipotent perspective, it goes through the production of the film, from inspiration through its effect on Psycho director Alfred Hitchcock’s life and career. Although only the first episode focuses on Gein himself, the podcast delves into the nitty-gritty of how writer Robert Bloch used his knowledge of the case to write his novel, Psycho , and the adaptation took on Hitchcock and the film’s star, Anthony Perkins. Murphy took a lot of liberties in his dramatization of this in Monster , but this podcast gets closer to the truth. The Holocaust History Podcast: The Trials of Ilse Koch with Tomaz Jardim Hosted by historian Dr. Waitman Wade Beorn, The Holocaust History Podcast is a serious and sobering look at the Nazi regime during World War II. In this episode, he sits down with fellow historian Dr. Tomaz Jardim, author of Ilse Koch on Trial: Making the ‘Bitch of Buchenwald,’ to separate truth from fiction around this larger-than-life Nazi villain. While they take care to remind the listener that Koch was a full-blown Nazi who was morally complicit in the atrocities, they get past the layers of the caricature she became after the war, particularly the allegations that she used the skin of Jewish victims to make lampshades and bind books. That cartoonish figure is what Gein would have read about — and what Murphy shows in Monster — but they show that hers was a more mundane evil, and one shared by many wives of the Nazis in power. Morbid: Ed Gein What’s a podcast list without a couple of women who call their beloved fans “Weirdos” and chat about true crime? Sisters Alaina Urquhart and Ash Kelley host this long-running podcast, breaking Gein’s story into three parts: His life and upbringing (they have particularly harsh words for his mom); his crimes and capture; and his life after conviction and legacy. Unlike some other chatty podcast series, Urquhart and Kelley go through the story with empathy and care, and often cite their sources. Like many of the podcasts on this list, they rely heavily on Harold Schechter’s 1989 book Deviant: The Shocking and True Story of Ed Gein, the Original Psycho .",https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-lists/monster-ed-gein-podcast-1235444428,Entertainment,BBC,Elisabeth Garber-Paul,https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Monster__The_Ed_Gein_Story.jpg?w=1600&h=900&crop=1,2025-10-12T15:00:00+00:00,3fdddc23f3e0caacb92bcea4c8dbb8e43dab054a
38a180547215,The 20 Best NES Games of All Time,,"The 20 Best NES Games of All Time From duck and vampire hunts to boxing and football sims, these are the titles that made the Nintendo Entertainment System legendary It was in October of 1985 when the Nintendo Entertainment System first hit North America, with an initial test run of 100,000 units being sold exclusively in New York City. Following the post-Atari video game market crash of 1983, no one was sure if there’d even be an appetite for yet another new digital toy to connect to the TV. But after the massive reception to the device and launch titles like Baseball and Duck Hunt , the potential was clear. It was a new era of gaming, and the Japanese company Nintendo was leading the charge. Within that first month, Super Mario Bros. also arrived, later becoming a pack-in title for the nationwide release of the NES the following year. With its killer app firmly established, the NES would begin its pop culture takeover that lasted well into the Nineties, amounting to a nearly 62 million units sold across all regions — a success so big, it’s credited with saving the home console market altogether. And although it was powerful enough for its time and introduced several hardware gimmicks (the NES Zapper is a stroke of genius), the NES’ legacy will always be defined by its downright ludicrous library of software. On top of its own first-party games like Mario , Metroid , and The Legend of Zelda , the OG Nintendo console was home to fledgling franchises from external partners like Konami, Capcom, and Tecmo — all of whom worked symbiotically (and at times antagonistically) with the Big N. Dragon Quest , Final Fantasy , Ninja Gaiden ; so many of today’s gaming dynasties began on the NES. It can be tough to narrow down which of the console’s games are its best. While nostalgia plays a factor, it’s just a fact that much of its lineup feels dated to play today. But looking back, there’s an astonishing number of NES releases that hold up to modern standards, and even the ones that may feel rough around the edges retain an undeniable impact. A bona fide classic can always be measured by how much you love it, even when it’s a pain in the ass to play. So, from groundbreaking platformers to slick shooters, these are the best NES games of all time. ‘Tecmo Super Bowl’ Image Credit: Tecmo Although most folks love RPGs or action-packed shooters, it’s impossible to understate the impact of sport games as a cultural juggernaut. There’s just something spectacular about bridging the gap between the cult of IRL sports with playable fantasy. The NES arrived with a handful of big ones like the bluntly named Baseball and Tennis , but 1989’s Tecmo Bowl brought it to another level. The first console game to officially strike a licensing agreement with the NFL Players Association, Tecmo’s sports sim let players control real athletes like Jerry Rice and Joe Montana to compete in the living room. Its sequel, Tecmo Super Bowl, upped the ante by also licensing the official team names, making for the most authentic football experience on the NES. Tecmo Super Bowl may feel rudimentary now, but the progenitor to franchises like Madden continued to be popular for decades thanks to an obsessive modding community that updated the game’s roster each season to give it an exponential afterlife. ‘Bionic Commando’ Image Credit: Capcom A key part of platforming games is the ability to jump, but Capcom’s Bionic Commando offers an alternative by letting players swing like Spider-Man using the protagonist’s robot arm. The game is challenging — especially during the learning curve of mastering the mechanics of grabbing, swinging, and climbing — but once it clicks, there’s few titles quite like it. Due to the angles required by the swinging system, Bionic Commando was one of the first games to emphasize eight-way aiming, although it’s limited to the grapple feature. Later entries would include the ability to shoot more directions and (thankfully) extend the arm mid-air, but the original remains a feat of ingenuity at a time when action-platformers were cementing their foundations. In a crowded field, Bionic Commando stands apart. ‘Blaster Master’ Image Credit: Sunsoft One of gaming’s greatest blessings is just how stupid a story can be as justification for the action. Sunsoft’s Blaster Master opens with a cinematic sequence that depicts a young man named Jason, whose pet frog breaks free and dives into a hole in the ground. Obviously, Jason follows and discovers a giant battle tank — which he immediately commandeers to slay a race of subterranean mutants. After its bizarre setup, Blaster Master quickly sets into one of the most kinetic experiences ever developed for the NES. Jason’s tank is extremely agile, allowing players to move quickly, jump nimbly, and aim freely in multiple directions. Each of its eight labyrinthine levels are dense with areas to explore, and the action remains constant. The mobile mech controls of Blaster Master feel so smooth, you’d almost be convinced they’re from a later era, feeling like the natural predecessor to contemporary mech-suit series like Armored Core . ‘Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles III: The Manhattan Project’ Image Credit: Konami Although arcades were the true home of early beat ‘em ups, early consoles like the NES had their fair share too. One such gem was the NES-exclusive Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles III: The Manhattan Project , which arrived in 1991 just when turtle mania was at its apex. With controls based on the previous entry, which itself was built off the coin-up arcade version of TMNT , The Manhattan Project is a mechanically streamlined gauntlet of ass-kicking. The game can be played solo or as a pair and features the ability to toggle on and off friendly fire (depending on how much you want to agitate your siblings). Like other TMNT games, each level is filled with an array of baddies from the animated series like Bebop and Rocksteady, as well as many iterations of Foot Clan soldiers, all of which have unique abilities based on their colors. While its SNES sequel, Turtles in Time may be heralded as the best in the series, The Manhattan Project is a high point for NES-era beat ‘em ups. ‘Excitebike’ Image Credit: Nintendo One of the best-selling games for the NES, Excitebike has one hell of a legacy. Developed by Shigeru Miyamoto for its 1984 Japanese release, the motocross racing game wasn’t just extremely well-designed in its own right, but its systems would influence other titles across genres for generations. Most directly, its 2D side-scrolling controls were adapted for Super Mario Bros ., giving the lead character his trademark inertia-building energy while running and jumping. Later on, its DNA could be felt in everything from Wave Race 64 to Flappy Bird , where strategically holding a button to gain altitude and angling the correct pitch for landing is key. But even if it hadn’t been so influential, Excitebike would still just be a damned fun game that holds up exceptionally well today. Dodging between lanes and correcting timing a jump boost is exhilarating, and the desire to best your own time always warrants another lap. ‘Super Dodge Ball’ Image Credit: CSG Imagesoft Long before the Ben Stiller movie introduced the idea of dodging a wrench as training for dodgeball, this spin-off of the River City game series made the gym class sport into a brutal proposition. Players control a six-man squad of ballers, with three populating the infield and another three surrounding the opposing team on the fringes of the court. Balls can be thrown plainly, but by initiating a sprint and properly timing the pitch, a superpowered special beans the opponent hard enough to propel them into the invisible walls. Like many games of the era, the visuals are janky. There’s almost never a moment when one or more characters are fully visible, constantly flickering and clipping in and out of frame. Yet the gameplay is smooth, precise, and surprisingly deep in its complexity. Traveling the world to conquer the dodgeball league is fun, but the real treat is the “bean ball” mode that boils the action down to a six-man free-for-all in a schoolyard where there are no rules or borders — only the ball and your killer instinct. ‘StarTropics’ Image Credit: Nintendo One of the few titles developed for the NES to never be released in Japan, StarTropics is a strange mash-up of RPG exploration and dungeon-crawling that feels like multiple games blended into one. The story follows a 15-year-old named Mike Jones who is visiting his archaeologist uncle on a tropical island. After his uncle goes missing, Mike must follow the clues gleaned from conversations with various townspeople that lead into different multi-level dungeons filled with puzzles to solve and creatures to beat with his trusty yo-yo and baseball-inspired kit. At times, it feels like Zelda , with shades of Final Fantasy , but the game oddly shares much of its DNA with the Japanese-only release, Mother (1989), which also followed a boy armed with a yo-yo and baseball bat for a fantasy adventure. StarTropics ultimately spawned just one sequel, but its genre-mixing premise and lush environments would make for a great modern revival, should Nintendo be so inclined. ‘R.C. Pro-Am’ Image Credit: Rare You’d think that the best racing game on the NES would involve high-power motorcycles or spaceships, but in truth, all that’s needed is a set of remote-controlled cars. Developed by Rare well before they reinvented Donkey Kong on the SNES , R.C. Pro-Am is an inventive take on top-down racing that wringed every ounce of power out of its console for finely tuned controls and solid physics. The game is played from a three-quarter perspective rather than from the rear of the cars, making it possible to turn in a full 360 degrees — often by mistake. The POV is distinct, forcing you to focus on the track’s many curves and anticipate the positioning needed, but it’s generous in how easily one can course correct a miscalculation. Instead of leaning into speed or hazards on the horizon, the rally vibe of Pro-Am offer a different way to race that’s surprisingly enthralling despite its quaintness. ‘Duck Hunt’ Image Credit: Nintendo Duck Hunt needs little introduction. One of the key launch titles for the NES’ North American market, its appeal is obvious. Utilizing the Zapper peripheral, it brought shooting gallery games from arcades and bars to people’s homes, and became a sensation so big, it was paired with Super Mario Bros. in a single cartridge as the must-have Nintendo games for many years. Its concept is simple: players aim the handheld gun at their CRT screen (it unfortunately doesn’t work with modern flatscreens) and shoot either flying ducks or play pigeons round after round in carnival game fashion. It’s a lizard-brained kind of pleasure, and is enjoyable at any skill level — although children of the Eighties likely have memories of being scolded for sitting too close to the TV. (Not cheating!) ‘Life Force’ Image Credit: Konami A spin-off of the Gradius series, Life Force (called Salamander in Japan) is a classic side-scrolling spaceship shooter where players must battle waves of flying baddies and constant environmental hazards, powering themselves up with pick-ups along the way. While Gradius itself is the bigger name and would be worthy of inclusion on any list, Life Force is the superior choice for numerous reasons. Firstly, the game is more forgiving, allowing players to bounce back from death right where they fell rather than being sent back to an arbitrary checkpoint. Secondly, its power-up system is streamlined, and allows multiple items to be combined to create an insane arsenal. Fully playable in co-op, Life Force is one of the best two-person games available for the NES. ‘Punch-Out!!’ Image Credit: Nintendo One of the most instantly recognizable names from the NES era, Punch-Out!! has seen multiple re-releases that will quickly pinpoint when someone picked up the game. The 1987 version featured then-World Heavyweight boxing champion Mike Tyson as its final boss, with a later 1990 release swapping out the at-times problematic (and pricey to license) real-life figure for the fictional creation, Mr. Dream. Adapted from Nintendo’s own arcade series, Punch-Out!! is arguably the best boxing game ever made. While it lacks the realism and depth of more contemporary franchises, its emphasis on rhythm and learning an opponent’s weakness was brilliant for the time. Aside from the entry-level fighter Glass Joe, bouts demand a deft balance of stamina management and reading each person’s tells, with specific behavior and character animations indicating when it’s time to dodge or strike, and in which direction. Endlessly playable, it’s a franchise that’s come and gone throughout Nintendo’s history, and there’s never a bad time to bring it back. ‘Dragon Quest III: The Seeds of Salvation’ Image Credit: Square Enix The NES as a platform was ground zero for numerous iconic roleplaying games like Final Fantasy and Fire Emblem , but the best of the bunch was Dragon Warrior ( Dragon Quest in Japan). The Americanized title has fallen by the wayside in recent years as Dragon Quest became more popular globally, and the third entry is considered by many to be the essential starting point. Featuring artwork from Dragon Ball creator Akira Toriyama , and RPG mechanics that will be familiar to fans of tabletop and video games of all eras, Dragon Quest III may look visually modest, but it plays extremely well. With a sprawling open world that allows for non-linear exploration, a heavily detailed class system that lets new recruits choose their abilities, and an epic fantasy narrative, Dragon Quest III is the definitive NES RPG. ‘Contra’ Image Credit: Konami One look at Contra ’s box art will tell you that it’s going for peak late-Eighties machismo. Equal parts Rambo , Predator , and Aliens , the run and gun side-scrolling shooter pits players as meathead commandos Bill Rizer or Lance Bean (or both in co-op) on a jungle mission to wipe out an alien army. Some stages scroll left-to-right while others move vertically, but the game’s greatest strength is its kinetic set pieces where big enemies arrive at scripted intervals to fuck things up. While many shooters of the era can feel clunky, Contra remains slick, with players easily able to drop between different layers of each level and drop prone to dodge incoming projectiles. Its weapons upgrade system is straightforward, requiring just simple item pickups to suddenly give the commandos spinning flamethrowers and big-balled shotgun blasts. Even though it’s been iterated on countless times, the original Contra is the ultimate form of dumb fun. ‘Metroid’ Image Credit: Nintendo Although Nintendo’s early work was mostly rooted in cheery cartoon aesthetics, one game stood out as something decidedly darker. Heavily influenced by Ridley Scott’s Alien , Metroid dropped players into a desolate world with little direction and even less hope. Players take on the role of Samus Aran, a lethal bounty hunter on the trail of a faction of space pirates who are harboring a mysterious biological weapon (spoiler: it’s a metroid!). Although it might feel like a chore to play for many today, the original Metroid popularized a dizzying amount of video game mechanics and tropes that’re currently employed in games like Hollow Knight and even 3D series like Elden Ring . Samus starts extremely weak, with minimal abilities to traverse the mazelike terrain. Inching along chamber-by-chamber (and hopefully drawing a map), players must find new tools that will open up blocked paths in older areas. While its SNES sequel would perfect these ideas, the first game is no slouch, and is every bit worth revisiting, if only to see an early vision of gaming’s present. ‘Castlevania III: Dracula’s Curse’ Image Credit: Konami It’s an odd trend in the NES era where the third entry of certain franchises ends up being chronologically a prequel, as is the case with Castlevania III: Dracula’s Curse . While the second game in the series leaned more heavily into RPG elements, Dracula’s Curse reverted to a more straightforward action-heavy approach, letting players explore multiple branching paths but always solving problems with a simple crack of the whip. A first for the series, the game stars multiple protagonists that can be swapped on the fly: vampire hunter Trevor Belmont, sorceress Sypha Belnades, pirate Grant Danasty, and Alucard — the dhampir son of Dracula himself. With a rich gothic atmosphere and moody soundtrack, Castlevania III is among the most aesthetically pleasing titles for the NES, and one of the most rewarding to play. Its story was recently adapted into Netflix’s Castlevania anime series, driving many to go back to explore its 8-bit origins. ‘Ninja Gaiden’ Image Credit: Koei Tecmo During the Seventies and Eighties, ninjas were all the rage. Obviously, the shadowy warriors would inspire waves of video games, among the best of which was the Ninja Gaiden series. Tecmo’s side-scrolling action series was acclaimed at the time for its then-cutting edge cinematic cutscenes, which told the narrative in animated sequences preceding each stage. In action, the game’s action is razor-sharp and its platforming is innovative, letting players cling to walls and bounce between tiers with the agility of a shinobi. Compared to its contemporaries, Ninja Gaiden ’s combat is surgical, allowing the hero Ryu to strike down foes with a single slice, although they continually regenerate and can become quickly overwhelming. It can be extremely tough to best all 20 levels, but for those up to the challenge, Ninja Gaiden is a perfect slice of retro action gaming. ‘The Legend of Zelda’ Image Credit: Nintendo One of Nintendo’s most prolific franchises, The Legend of Zelda has a long history of delivering some of the greatest games of all time . But it all began with the NES original, which presented many players with their first experience with a truly open world to explore. Starring the elf-eared hero Link, the game is all about discovery as users trek through the various biomes of Hyrule, stumbling across dungeons and secret chambers that house crucial items to reach new areas and combat enemies. The game’s open-ended environment is miraculous given the limitations of the NES, but it begins to make sense once players figure out the world’s grid-like regions. For many, the only way to solve its mysteries was to use a physical map, scribbling solutions, theories, and X’s to mark each critical spot. The NES was home to a multitude of grandiose fantasy adventures, but none were as legendary as Zelda . ‘Super Mario Bros.’ Image Credit: Nintendo There will never be another game like the first Super Mario Bros . While the NES debuted with a full lineup of bangers, the 1985 platformer blew the lid off the industry when it arrived, quickly being retrofitted as the pack-in title that warranted the purchase of the console itself. It was the Nintendo game, and in many ways, it still is. Designed by the maestro behind most of the company’s early classics, Shigeru Miyamoto, Super Mario Bros. plucked the playable hero from 1981’s Donkey Kong arcade game and gave him a complete overhaul. Firstly, he got a name (Mario!), as well as a brother (Luigi!), but most importantly, he gained the distinct ability to run and jump with extreme precision. Over the years, most players have completely memorized the various stages of the game to the point where you can see it with eyes closed, but it’s to the game’s credit that even if you (somehow) never tried it, it’s insanely easy to learn. Forty years after its release, Super Mario Bros . plays like a dream, with an incredible sense of momentum and tight control. And on top of inspiring thousands of games throughout decades, it almost singlehandedly saved gaming as the crown jewel of a console whose phenomenal popularity reinvigorated the industry. ‘Mega Man 2’ Image Credit: Capcom There’s something to be said for the value of player choice, and Capcom’s Mega Man series is built on the simple conceit of letting people pick how they want to tackle its challenges. At the start of each attempt, you’re presented with a list of eight levels to choose from, each with their own environmental theme and a special boss at the end. The hitch is that each of the bad guys can be more easily thwarted by another one’s abilities (which Mega Man himself gains after killing them). Which way do you start? What’s the ideal flowchart for beating them all? Sometimes, it just boils down to which ones you’re able to defeat. Mega Man 2 is the series’ best installment, famously perfecting the run and gun gameplay introduced by its predecessor while improving the level design. If Mario lets players rely on twitchy response time and frequently forgiving physics, Mega Man is all about methodical progression. Each level introduces entirely new elements, like conveyer belts of conflicting speeds and opposite trajectories that demand measured timing to traverse while being assailed by robots. The arc of the game is deeply memorable, a Jacob’s Ladder-like ascension through all levels into the endgame, which consists of a sequence of linear stages plus a second round with every one of the previous bosses. It’s a grueling gauntlet, but Mega Man 2 lives at the nexus of stellar action and platforming perfection. ‘Super Mario Bros. 3’ Image Credit: Nintendo How Nintendo managed to one-up its flagship title remains a marvel. The first attempt to create direct sequel to Super Mario Bros. was famously a bust. While the Japanese attempt mostly amounted to a more difficult expansion ( The Lost Levels ), the American one was literally a reskin of an entirely different game with the newly popular characters swapped in. Neither hit the mark, and for the third installment, Nintendo needed to think bigger. Super Mario Bros. 3 took everything the original did so well and exponentially upped the ante. Its levels are compact, dense with increasingly complex physical puzzles of dexterity whose solutions are taught organically in motion. Its visuals are lively; the many regions of the Mushroom Kingdom all feel distinct and packed to the brim with personality. The power-ups, from the Fire Flower to the Tanooki Suit, all give players an edge without making them helpless by losing them. While the 1985 game introduced the characters and world, it was Super Mario Bros 3. that cemented countless staples of the franchise that continue today. The world map lets players choose which routes to take between levels and provided bonus stages to hoarding items. The addition of new powerups let Mario take to the sky with the Super Leaf or throw projectiles in the Hammer Suit. Each of Bowser’s children, the Koopalings, provided a different threat as regional bosses rather than being different flavors of the same old thing. Generations later, gaming doesn’t get much better than Super Mario Bros. 3 . Despite its vintage, it’s a guaranteed joy to pick up and play, no matter how many times you’ve beat it. Although the NES would continue getting new releases well into the early Nineties, it ultimately peaked here. Super Mario Bros. 3 is the embodiment of everything that makes a Nintendo game great, and is easily the best of what the era had to offer.",https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/rs-gaming-lists/best-nes-games-of-all-time-1235442260,Entertainment,BBC,Christopher Cruz,https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/NES_2-1.jpg?w=1600&h=900&crop=1,2025-10-12T14:00:00+00:00,2452de7d2b8ba8741343c656008e604d6fd0529c
cd22c222aff4,"There’s Now a Casino in Everyone’s Pocket. For Some Young Men, It’s a Near-Fatal Gamble",,"F or Andrew Douglas, bottom was seven cops banging on the door of his apartment. He’d sharpened the knife “good,” filled the bathtub with water, and downed a vial of Coumadin to bleed out faster. Had his dad not sensed something and dialed 911, Andrew, a star baseball player turned gambling addict in college, would have quietly checked out at age 33, leaving his twin infant sons, his guilt-crippled parents, and many thousands of dollars in gambling debts behind. For Jonah, bottom wasn’t failing out of college and mulling suicide. Nor was it the month in a Florida rehab, where, for some fool reason, they let him have his cellphone and he bet money he’d stolen from family on four-legged parlay bets. (More on parlays later.) No, for Jonah, a lacrosse player at a powerhouse program, bottom was crossing the last bridge of honor: trading inside info with players at other schools to cover the over/under on games they bet. For the seven mostly young men sitting around this table, bottom was a grave of their own digging — a hole so deep that their cries for help went unheard. “My thoughts were too crazy, I thought that no one would get them,” says Marcus, a mid-twentysomething dressed like a gamer: black glasses, high-top Chucks, and a Playskool-colored sweatshirt. At his bottom, he was staring out the window of his apartment, weighing whether a fall from five flights up would kill or merely maim him. “I got to where suicide sounded sane.” (Excepting Andrew, above, the gamblers in this story spoke in exchange for anonymity.) We’re lunching at a sports bar in a Philadelphia suburb, picking at taste-free wings and waffle fries. It’s a curious place to bring a group of recovering gamblers, but the man at the head of the table has his reasons. Harry Levant has always been a rower against the river: a former criminal-defense attorney who lost his license, and nearly lost his life, to his own gambling jones a decade back; a second-chance crusader and addictions counselor who mainly treats folks gutted by gambling disorders; and a peripatetic opponent of the online gambling behemoths DraftKings and FanDuel , and the other sports-betting operators (hereafter, SBOs). Forty weeks a year, Levant’s somewhere in the air, lecturing state legislators and groups of physicians about the betting apps’ ploys and snares, as well as the harms he says they’ve levied on Gen Z males. That grail of Levant’s reads lonely and self-devouring: the mania of the gambler repurposed for public service. “Every addictive product has regulations,” says Levant. “Why is this the only one without them?” As his clients tell their stories, a loose narrative hangs together. With an exception here and there, most of these guys started gambling as teens, playing lunchroom hold-em and NFL parlays for a buck or two a throw. Then they got to college, rooming and running with older kids. Here, suddenly, everyone seemed to be in action, be it betting stupid sums on esports soccer or throwing 15 bucks at a five-legged parlay that paid out 20 to one but rarely cashed. (A parlay is a combo bet on two or more outcomes; to collect, you must win each outcome, or “leg.” Should you hit on four legs but miss the fifth, you lose whatever money you put down. Oh, and the odds of winning that five-legged parlay? Less than five percent.) Hospitalized after a suicide attempt due to gambling debts, Andrew Douglas says nurses turned on the NBA Finals and handed him his phone: “I gambled away my last $100.” The portals and drivers for much of this action were the giant sports-bet apps. On the party-colored killing floor of online gambling, FanDuel and DraftKings own most of the take, cornering 80 percent of the mobile bet market in this country. Eight years ago, Americans placed around $5 billion in sports bets. Last year, that number zoomed to nearly $150 billion; by 2028, we’ll have bet — and lost — a trillion dollars since 2018. That was the year the Supreme Court reversed a federal ban on legalized gambling, freeing each state to partner with Big Sports Bet and feed their residents, especially the young ones, to the wolves. FanDuel and DraftKings wasted no time. They’d spent hundreds of millions of dollars, and the better part of a decade, carpet-bombing the airwaves with ads. Now, they paid kings’ ransoms to each of the major sports leagues in exchange for their data and branding, and partnered with, or bought up, AI firms to help target their users’ browsing habits, favorite teams, and sports. “DraftKings, for one, bought SimpleBet, the biggest AI firm in this space, to turn data into in-game microbets,” says Levant. “Then they tracked and used their customers’ data to determine which of them preferred making constant, nonstop bets — and pushed those bets their way.” Bombarded by promos for FanDuel and DraftKings — “Get a $1,000 deposit bonus!” reads one DraftKings blast — underage boys pressed their parents to open accounts, often linked to dad’s ID and banking info, critics claim. Or they surreptitiously opened accounts without their parents’ knowledge, as teens have done with verboten vices since the dawn of time. “Young guys have always bonded around sports; it’s wired into their pack behavior,” says Levant. “What the apps do is monetize that pack behavior: Guys bond over sports bets, not sports, now.” Reached for comment on the matter, DraftKings and FanDuel pushed back on the contention that underage gambling is rampant on their apps, pointing to the safeguards they have in place. “DraftKings is committed to providing a legal, regulated, and responsible gaming environment for adults,” wrote a spokesperson for the company. “We employ advanced Know Your Customer (KYC) technology, relied on by the financial industry and law enforcement, to verify the age of our customers. Any use of our platform by minors violates both our Terms of Use and the law, and we actively monitor to detect and report this prohibited activity.” It bears noting that neither SBO agreed to on-the-record interviews for this piece. Instead, they responded with written statements, like the one from FanDuel, as follows: “As a legal, licensed and regulated operator, we ​have focused on the importance of educating college students on the risks associated with gambling. Notably, recovered problem gambler and national TV host Craig Carton brings lived experience and well-documented struggles with gambling to campuses through the FanDuel Responsible Gaming College Tour. Additionally, we have extended our education efforts to reach families by creating the Trusted Voices parent portal which provides tools and resources to talk to young people about gambling, associated risks, how to recognize warning signs and where to go for support.” To be clear, most adults who gamble on sports do so as a harmless time suck, a way to zest their weekend football viewing. And  countless teens put 10 spots on ballgames without getting dragged into addiction . “There are kids with a healthy relationship to money who can gamble casually on sports,” says Jody Bechtold, the CEO and founder of the Better Institute in Pittsburgh and a distinguished lecturer on gambling addiction. “But there are lots of other kids wired differently these days — high anxiety, ADHD, over-immersion in video games — who’re at much higher risk of addiction.” That’s especially so for kids “from affluent families who never learned the value of a dollar. Money’s supposed to hurt when you lose it,” but they were raised on “all things cashless: Venmo, PayPal, you name it.” Two years ago, the NCAA published a study on the steep surge of gambling on college campuses. It found that 67 percent of students living on campus were betting on sports — though simple math tells us that the large majority of those bettors likely wouldn’t have been of legal age to do so. Worse, many engaged in a particularly rash form of gaming, making high-speed wagers on in-game action — a pernicious new product called microbetting. Last year, a study by the National Council on Problem Gambling found that betting on campus had surged to 75 percent — and that six percent of students were addicted to gambling, or nearly double the national average. And who on campus is qualified to treat this gusher of gambling addictions? Essentially no one, per the experts I talked to. “Colleges aren’t set up to treat [six percent] of their students,” says Jim Lange, the executive director of the Higher Education Center for Alcohol and Drug Misuse Prevention and Recovery at Ohio State University. “That isn’t our business model, and never will be.” He added that most schools don’t even know they have a problem: Gambling is scarcely mentioned in the National Collegiate Health Assessment, the standard tool used by schools to track drug and alcohol misuse by students. None of those stats is news to the young men sitting at this table. “When I owed money to every kid I knew and was betting on Chinese ping-pong at 4 a.m., I tried going for counseling on campus,” says Marcus, the gamer kid. “As I’m talking to the counselor, she’s pulling a manual off the shelf, looking up [the definition of] ‘problem gambling.’” FanDuel and DraftKings have paid king’s ransoms to each of the major sports leagues in exchange for their data and partnered with AI firms to help target users’ habits. Ron Vesely/Getty Images “In the hospital, where I was hooked up to a bunch of IVs [after his failed suicide bid], they turned the NBA Finals on and gave me my phone; I gambled away my last $100,” says Andrew, the ex-baseball player. Things were no better during his 30-day stay at an addiction clinic in Florida. “They didn’t touch on gambling at all.” So, too, for Jonah, the former lacrosse player, sent to an out-of-state facility at 21. “This place knew nothing about gambling addiction. They gave us two hours of phone time a day, and I set up a VPN to bet in Philly.” I hear a collective intake of breath as Jonah wraps his story. For all the suffering at this table, there’s a redemptive kinship as well, and a recognition that feels like rescue. The six percent of college kids who lose $500 or more in a day? “We used to be those kids,” says Marcus, to grunts and knowing head nods. “This is what it looks like, five years later.” Thousands of dollars stolen from a doting grandma. A bride empaupered months after her wedding. Betrayals so base they can’t be spoken to other people — but with this group, there are no secrets or judgments; only gratitude for the chance to come clean. Eight years ago, Americans placed around $5 billion in sports bets. Last year, that number zoomed to nearly $150 billion “After all those months and years in the cold, here you’re among friends who know exactly what you’ve gone through,” says Levant. “And all I ask in return from these guys: Don’t make a bet today.” Andrew cuts in here to show me his phone. “Look at that top email, from Caesars,” he says. It reads, Your mystery bonus is here . “Four years since I shut down that app, they’re still tryna get their hooks in me.” “And that,” says Levant, “is why I chose this place.” He points to the flat-panels mounted above the tables, 50 or 60 sets tuned to Fox Sports 1 or the umpteenth rerun of “First Take.” Every last one of them posts a ticker at the bottom: Odds brought to you by either FanDuel or DraftKings. “This is what these guys have to live with,” says Levant. “They can’t run from sports or those fucking apps. All they can do is change their response.” A Caesars Sportsbook logo looms large over the scoreboard at Rate Field in Chicago. Patrick Gorski/Icon Sportswire/Getty Images MALIK BEASLEY, A SIZZLING SCORER and prime free agent, may never see the floor in another game. After nearly $60 million made in the NBA, he’s awash in debt and unwanted by teams after a federal DA poked through his gambling tabs. ( Recently cleared in that probe , he remains unsigned as basketball season approaches.) Emmanuel Clase is one of the best closers in baseball, but he won’t get to throw another pitch until the sport gets done scouring his prop-bet plays. Clase faces a lifetime ban if MLB can prove he engaged in spot-fixing, the practice of shading his own stat lines by intentionally sailing a slider over his catcher’s head. Jontay Porter could be headed to prison shortly: The NBA center copped to conspiracy to commit wire fraud recently for his part in a prop-bet ring. And Ippei Mizuhara is doing fed time already for stealing millions from his famous boss, Shohei Ohtani, to pay off gambling debts. If men who have everything can’t stop betting long enough to save their prized careers, how will we keep a generation of teens from taking a match to their futures? We find ourselves on the cusp of this disaster thanks in part to a petition brought in 2018 by Gov. Phil Murphy of New Jersey. Murphy and his predecessor, Gov. Chris Christie, filed a brief with the U.S. Supreme Court, seeking to decriminalize wagers on sports in their state. They were suing to unleash a product so destructive that in 2013 the doctors and clinicians of the American Psychiatric Association added “gambling disorder” to the list of substance disorders in their revised standard text, the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Volume 5. It was an extraordinary upgrade, says Levant, the first of its kind: warning readers of a “substance” they couldn’t smoke, shoot, or snort, but which was nonetheless “highly addictive” and “similar in nature to heroin, opioids, tobacco, alcohol, and cocaine.” “We reclassified gambling because it shared the symptomology of classic narcotic addiction, “ says Dr. Petros Levounis, past president of the APA. “We’re greatly concerned now because of the rise in sports betting. There’s a striking likeness to the tobacco and opioid industries — and there’s consensus among us that those industries committed crimes that resulted in suffering and death.” (Approached for comment, Murphy sent this boilerplate: “The Murphy Administration is concerned by the growing national epidemic of online sports-betting addiction, particularly among young men. What begins as occasional recreational betting too often spirals into financial instability, anxiety and depression, and high-risk habits. Our Administration is committed to mitigating the risks associated with problem gambling, including expanding treatment options and holding bad operators accountable.”) FanDuel and DraftKings have cornered 80 percent of the mobile sports-bet market in America. Rob Carr/Getty Images Harmful substances, such as alcohol and narcotics, are typically regulated and controlled. But when presented with what some experts call “the biggest public health threat since Big Tobacco,” SCOTUS killed the only law shielding Americans from the corporate bet sharks. That law, called PASPA (Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act), did precisely what its title proposed. It protected pro and college sports leagues from point-shave rings; kept the Mob (and enraged bettors) off the backs of the players; and put so much physical distance between gamblers and casinos that they couldn’t lose their shirts on a passing hunch. To be sure, problem gamblers found their way around it, opening accounts with offshore sportsbooks or a local guy-who-knew-a-guy. But the damage was contained to the vulnerable few, which is about the best you can hope for from a law. What followed, post-PASPA, was so predictable, you couldn’t have gotten odds for it at Vegas. A sanctimonious foe of sportsbooks for decades, the NFL immediately entered talks with FanDuel and DraftKings. For billions in betting revenue, the league leased those firms the rights to its stat packs, metrics, and branding. That proprietary data enabled the apps to launch a brand-new product: live, in-game wagers on practically anything that happened on field. No longer were kids forced to wait hours on an outcome; now, they could bet on every play and every player through AI-brokered props in real time. That phenomenon, called microbetting, forever changed gambling by turbo-boosting the speed of betting behaviors. The effect of microbetting, if not its intent, is to induce a fugue state that keeps users in action. “You lose track of time and space, and next thing you know, you’re betting Indian cricket at 4 a.m.,” says Marcus. “I don’t even know the rules of cricket. Those fuckin’ matches go on for three days!” Every major pro sports league followed football’s lead, selling their data for a slice of the sports-bet pie. The effect on problem gamblers was catastrophic. “I went from betting money lines on baseball games to betting the number of runs scored in every inning,” says Frankie, a client of Levant’s in his late twenties with a South Philly brogue and a shiny widow’s peak. “Any money left at the end of the night, I’m flipping to FanDuel’s casino. Then it’s slots and blackjack till I bust, and now I’m betting Chinese ping-pong at 3 a.m.” A year ago May, Frankie married his sweetheart in a grand Italian wedding. The guests sent them off with a pillowcase full of cash. Behind his wife’s back, Frankie lost all the cash, then defaulted on the mortgage for their house. “I didn’t know where to turn,” he says. “Suicide was my only option till I found Harry.” Two years ago, the NCAA published a study on the steep surge of gambling on college campuses. It found that 67 percent of students living on campus were betting on sports Those microbets and parlay packs that hooked Levant’s clients are the SBOs’ profit centers. How do we know this? Because the apps themselves say so: They’re the bets featured in their ads. Kevin Hart, Rob Gronkowski, Tom Brady, LeBron James: You can’t shut them up and make them go away when they’re touting props and parlays in every promo. Nor can you squelch their motormouthed peers on the pods and sports-bet shows: the Bill Simmonses and Charles Barkleys and Scott Van Pelts, who’ve merrily boarded the gravy train as “ambassadors” for the SBOs. (Approached for comment, Simmons, Barkley and Van Pelt declined to speak.) “Among the dangers of celebrity endorsements is the normalization of an addictive product,” says Levant. “They’re accepting enormous sums to push [that] addictive product on an increasingly younger audience.” AFTER THE FALL OF PASPA, states raced one another to the betting window, smelling 10-figure windfalls in new taxes. Thirty-nine states plus D.C. and Puerto Rico passed bills that legalized the sports-bet racket. The ensuing carnage was swift and savage. New callers flooded the toll-free hotlines at 1-800-GAMBLER, and frantically searched the web for help, googling “gambling addiction” online. The state of New Jersey saw a nearly 300 percent spike in hotline calls in the first five years of legal betting. (Around six percent of its residents now suffer from gambling disorders — or three times the national average, per a Rutgers survey .) In Connecticut, the number of hotline calls increased 200 percent in the first two years — and the crisis was most acute among young men. “Forty percent of those calls are coming from twentysomething males,” says Diana Goode, the executive director of the Connecticut Council on Problem Gambling, who likens the legalization of gambling to the opioid crisis. “It’s literally the same thing they did with pain pills. These companies hand out free samples [i.e., welcome bonuses] to get [young men] addicted to betting.” Gambling-addiction expert Jody Bechtold says young men are especially susceptible to the dangers of this culture because they’ve grown up immersed “in a stew of ads” from the Big Two betting apps. Brett Carlsen/Getty Images I put the obvious question to clinician after clinician: Why are young people, males in particular, so susceptible to sports-bet apps? Bechtold, the founder and director of the Better Institute in Pittsburgh, began with the mile-high view. “This generation was basically bred for addiction, [having been] raised on cellphones inches from their faces.” The feeds on those devices “disrupted their neural wiring,” leaving them anxious, impulsive, and susceptible to “stims that are quick and constant onscreen.” Their online childhoods also robbed them of life skills best learned by leaving the house. Fiscal savvy gained by working part-time jobs. Risk awareness from running the streets, and an acquired sense of consequences from actions. “When these kids go bust, time after time it’s the parents who bail them out,” says Bechtold. “Every family I deal with, I say, ‘Quit giving the kid money!’ And Mom says, ‘Oh, I’m not ready to do that yet.’” Bechtold says these things not to shame her clients, but to name the preconditions that make them targets. They’ve grown up immersed “in a stew of ads” from the Big Two betting apps; been chased across the web by their pings and promotions; and been told by the celebrities they trust most to think that betting’s how winners have fun. It normalizes gambling as “something cool to do with your friends,” she says. Now layer on the male-skewing lubricant of sports, and you’ve built “a mass addiction machine,” says Matt Gaskell, the clinical lead for the NHS Northern Gambling Service in England. “These companies engineered a product that exploits the reward pathways” of young brains. “The constant crackle of dopamine keeps them playing” — and then a big bump, equivalent to a “spike of heroin,” is triggered by “a win on their team.” Eventually, though, the wins and losses cease to matter. What keeps these kids in action is “that neurochemical feed that fires the desire centers in the brain.” Gaskell’s had a decade-plus jump on his peers: Britain legalized mobile sports bets in 2005. The fallout has been tragic. “We have an estimated one to two suicides a day in England, and many of the ones I know of are of young men from middle-class families with university training” he says. Rather than confront the SBOs by slapping limits on their ads and promos — “our kids see 1,600 gambling logos in a 90-minute [soccer] match onscreen,” says Gaskell — the British government lamely lists “gambling disorder” as an official cause of death. “This industry has captured our policymakers with its billions, as I expect it’s done with yours. So the warning from over here is, expect disaster.” EVER WONDER WHAT LIFE’S LIKE with a serpent on your shoulder, whispering in your ear to bet the Braves? For Andrew, the ex-third baseman in college, that forked-tongue enticer gave him no quarter, hissing Check the bonus! at 6 a.m. “Between the voice in my head and the texts from the sportsbooks, I wasn’t really sleeping a whole lot,” he says in his honey-maple drawl from the Carolinas. “Every night, I’d tell myself, ‘That’s your last bet.’ Then every morning, I’d get up, see the bonus on my phone, and bet double what I did the day before.” He’s calling from his flat in eastern Pennsylvania, a bachelor pad he’s put through the wringer. There are gashes in the walls he’s just getting around to fixing: holes he made throwing weights and plates after losing thousands of dollars in three hours. “I’ve never hit anyone in my life,” he says. “But I’ve got a hell of an arm.” Between September of 2020, when he moved up from Atlanta to join the mother of his unborn twins in Pennsylvania, and May of 2024, when he placed his last wager, he bet more than a million dollars, he says, on live, long-shot parlays and props. He’s not sure how much of that was lost on the apps, but concedes it was “a lot.” A study by the National Council on Problem Gambling found that betting on campus had surged to 75 percent — and that six percent of students were addicted to gambling, or nearly double the national average He says he stole cash from his parents on visits home to Greenville, and guilted them into stopgap loans he knew he’d never repay. On blue-sky weeks when he won more than he lost, he’d go out and buy himself something he cherished — a new titanium driver; a pricey pair of Jordans — then sell them on for half when he went bust. “I’d walk around my place whenever I hit zero, seeing everything I owned as dollar signs.” His beloved baseball glove; the cashmere quarter-zips his grandma bought him for Christmas — anything to raise a hundred bucks and feed the addiction. Andrew got addicted to betting in college, playing — and hitting — his first-ever backdoor cover. “I had Duke in March Madness, and was just about to lose,” he recalls. But then a ref blew the whistle as the buzzer sounded, giving Duke two meaningless free throws while up by four. With a make on the second, Duke won by five, miraculously beating the spread of 4 1/2, per Andrew’s telling. His brain went kablooey on dopamine. “I can’t even describe it — it was the best feeling ever. I thought it was gonna work like that all the time.” Gambling experts talk about the “first-win trap” — a neurochemical surge that swamps the pleasure center, sparking delirium only matched by high-test heroin. “The reward’s beyond anything in our day-to-day lives,” says Gaskell. “It’s literally off the scale we see in” brain scans. “There’s a reason we call gambling a substance disorder,” says Levant. “But the substance isn’t the dough — it’s the dopa.” Andrew gave up baseball, got a degree in health fitness, and earned a good living as a trainer in Atlanta. He was constantly in the hole, though, laying a dozen bets a day with the bookies or the offshore apps. Then he met a girl and moved her into his place. Months later, she was pregnant with their twins. “She’d no idea I gambled; no one did, till finally my parents caught on.” That’s the core difference between gamblers and other addicts. There’s nothing physical that gives them away: no unexplained weight loss; no cocktail-hour slurring. That secrecy, born of shame, can destroy a spouse and family. They don’t find out that their loved one’s stolen from them till the marshals are at the door with eviction papers. In 2023, the Public Health Advocacy Institute filed a class-action consumer-fraud lawsuit against DraftKings. A judge rejected the company’s motion to dismiss. Mark Cunningham/MLB Photos/Getty Images For every person hiding a gambling disorder, six people in their orbit are impacted financially, according to the World Health Organization. The collateral impacts of new gambling addictions are just now being charted by clinicians. Among states that have legalized sports-bet apps, bankruptcies are up by 30,000 a year, per a USC-UCLA study still in progress. A second study, from Northwestern, found that eight percent of the households in legal-gambling states were wagering on SBOs — and that every dollar spent on those apps cost households double in net-worth losses. And so states that took the bait of new-tax windfalls find themselves in a hole. Who’s going to cover the living expenses of families ruined by problem bettors? And who’s going to pay for those bettors’ treatment when, or if, they seek help? (Less than 10 percent of gambling addicts ever come in for counseling, per the National Council on Problem Gambling.) Of all the grim ephemera linked to legal gambling, this fact might be the starkest: For every dollar paid in taxes by SBOs, the states spend, on average, .0009 cents providing therapy for the addicts they’ve helped create, according to theNCPG . WHAT’S A YOUNG MAN TO DO when all the outlets he watches — ESPN, Paramount+, Peacock, Fox Sports — either own or have partnered with a sportsbook? When FanDuel and DraftKings push him their bet boosts while he’s scrolling reels? When SportsCenter plates him up a side of “Bad Beats” to pair with its “Top Ten Plays”? The effect of all that noise is to sell a tautology: that gambling is harmless fun when done in measure. It’s both the message and the method of the SBOs, who affix their buzzwords — “responsible gaming,” or RG — to the toe plate in all their ads. I called their collective trade rep, the American Gaming Association, to get a sense of RG in practice. Joe Maloney, a senior vice president, explained it to me — after expressing shock that kids use the apps. “The prevailing legal age for wagering is 21,” he told me. “We verify identities, we verify ages — and if a parent is opening [an account] for the use of a minor, that’s a violation of our terms of service. And if it’s found to have been done, then those individuals are banned from having accounts at these sites.” “If there’s college kids jumping out of windows now, we need to see those accounts to figure out why. We have a moral obligation to those kids and their families. Otherwise, we’ll lose a generation.” I granted the point, and pressed him about RG. Maloney was just getting warm, however. “We have a code of conduct that includes not casting anyone under 21 in our ads, and ensuring that the known audience of paid advertising is believed to be above 73 percent 21 [or older],” he told me. “We ban all university partnerships. We ban all agreements with NIL [Name, Image and Likeness] athletes. There’s no leafletting and pamphlet dropping on college campuses. None of those things are permitted.” He went on like this for 15 minutes, laying out the Four Pillars of RG. “Stick to a budget. Bet legally [i.e., on their apps, not offshore sites]. Know the odds. And keep it fun. Do it in the company of others,” said Maloney. “This is not a wealth-creation exercise [or] an investment vehicle. This is entertainment.” Since grade school, we’ve been trained to blame the addict for addiction: a failure of will and want-to in the weak. Even when the truth emerges, we still default to that warhorse, character, as the root of personal ruin. It’s only when the operators are forced to pay out fortunes that we finally fault the poisoner, not the poisoned. Hundreds of billions recovered from the tobacco companies, not counting the giant verdicts they keep losing. More than 6.5 billion from the Sackler family. In America, the facts must defer to the funds. Our justice is a giant cardboard check. No one knows that lesson better than Dick Daynard, the godfather of tobacco litigation. A Harvard-trained lawyer, he founded a pivotal nonprofit, the Tobacco Products Liability Project, as a young attorney in the Eighties. TPLP became the tip line and database for the lawyers, reporters, and confidential sources who finally beat Big Tobacco in the mid- to late-Nineties. We’re sitting at a table in his offices in Boston, a quarter or so mile from Fenway Park. Joining us is Mark Gottlieb, Daynard’s voluble chief of staff, and the jet-lagged Harry Levant, just back from two symposia in Colorado. It was Levant who approached Daynard with his next crusade: suing the SBOs for the harms done to their users. Daynard, a laconic sort who wouldn’t order a hot dog without due process, tasked his staff to study the matter closely. “The doom loop of addiction?” says Gottlieb. “The losses that last till the customer drops? It wasn’t a tough decision to go forward.” Harry Levant is a longtime foe of the SBOs: “Among the dangers of celebrity endorsements is the normalization of an addictive product.” Thato Dadson/Courtesy of Harry Levant Through TPLP’s successor, the Public Health Advocacy Institute, Daynard’s team brought the first sports-bet lawsuit in Massachusetts in 2023. They picked DraftKings as their opening-round opponent. The complaint they filed was a strategic one: a tautly focused claim of consumer fraud. “Plaintiffs allege that the offer of the $1,000 bonus … was and is unfair and deceptive because, among other things, a new customer would, in order to get a $1,000 bonus, actually need to deposit five times that amount and then, within 90 days, place $25,000 in bets with only certain odds of return,” the suit reads. “In other words, the ‘$1,000 Bonus’ is structured so that it is inordinately expensive to obtain $1,000, and the new user is, instead, statistically likely to lose money by chasing the bonus.” “In what world would anyone call that ‘responsible gaming’?”  Daynard says. He filed the case, a class action, in Massachusetts, a state with stringent consumer-protection laws. DraftKings, for its part, filed a motion to dismiss. Its argument? “No reasonable consumer would have understood the Promotion in the terms that Plaintiffs allege.” That pleading was roundly denied by the judge; last summer, the case proceeded to discovery. Barring a settlement, the case heads to trial in two years. Meantime, Daynard’s colleagues are scouring DraftKings’ files, combing through tranches of court-compelled data to see if they can prove that DraftKings’ allegedly fraudulent ads are “deceptive to its target customers,” per the suit. To be clear: Gottlieb et al. aren’t bucking for prohibition. Legal gambling is here to stay, and they’re … OK with that. “Abolishing it at this point is DOA; there’s too much critical mass to take it down,” says Levant, who recently moved to Boston as the gambling-policy director of PHAI. “All we ask for are common-sense changes to the way these outfits do business.” For a list of those changes, I spoke to John Keenan, a reformer in the Massachusetts Senate. Keenan’s seen this rodeo before: He chaired the Senate’s Joint Committee on Mental Health and Substance Abuse through the last two waves of the opioids crisis. “When you look at Purdue Pharma, what did they have? A new product they hawked relentlessly — and often falsely,” says Keenan. Same difference with Big Sports Bet, except “their marketing’s an onslaught: They’ve rewritten the book on selling addictive products.” So Keenan’s sponsored a bill called the Bettor Health Act. Besides raising the state-tax rate on SBOs from 20 to 51 percent, it would instantly ban all sports-bet ads during live, in-game broadcasts. Further, it would outlaw player props, i.e., a parlay on Steph Curry to hit more than four threes and exceed eight assists against the Lakers. (Keenan calls those bets “the crack cocaine” of gambling.) The bill would also slap affordability checks on the SBOs: “If [someone] bets more than $1,000 a day, the industry has to check [his] bank account” to be sure he can support that action, says Keenan. But maybe the best thing Keenan’s bill would do is force the apps to share their data with the state. “If there’s college kids jumping out of windows now, we need to see those accounts to figure out why. We have a moral obligation to those kids and their families. Otherwise, we’ll lose a generation.” IT’S BEEN MORE THAN A YEAR now since Andrew placed a bet — but he’ll be the first to admit he’s been here before. “I quit cold turkey in 2020,” he says, “when my girlfriend found out she was pregnant.” Months of sobriety later, he rented a U-Haul and trucked their joint possessions to Pennsylvania. But driving across the line into Delaware — the first state, by a nose, to approve the apps — Andrew was beset by FanDuel radio ads and billboards. That night, he opened an account, grabbed the welcome bonus, and promptly lost his mind for four years. “The guy I became — I don’t know who that was,” he says. Depressed and withdrawn, “always snapping at my girl; all I wanted to do was go and hide.” He holed up in the spare room of the place they’d rented, betting like he’d never bet in Georgia. “Those offshore apps — yeah, I liked my parlays, but they just had the basics,” meaning money line, point spread, over/under. But FanDuel? “FanDuel was fuckin’ Disneyland, man. You could build your own parlay off a thousand different props — and the crazier the props, the bigger the payout.” That, he hastens to add, is how to tell you’re an addict: “We only play the long shots. Longer, the better.” Seven months after the couple moved north, Andrew’s girlfriend left him and took their three-month-olds with her. Andrew hasn’t seen his kids, now four, since; he relinquished his parental rights during that four-year spiral, failing to appear at visitations. Though he’s stable enough now to send her child support, he hasn’t pushed his ex for visitation. “I have no moral ground to be in their lives,” he says. “I burned every bridge and ruined every trust with everyone I ever knew. At this point, it’s just about living my life and trying to prove I can do better.” Though we’re speaking by phone, I sense his mood straying, drawn to the shadows of the past. There’s a species of forgetting when you’ve lived apart, a gap that can’t be filled by stepping back into the world. Of all the sunk assets, faith is the dearest: faith that you still matter out there, and still share a language with other people. To reclaim that faith, Andrew’s gone public with his story, telling it to anyone who’ll listen. He’s appeared, under his own name, on CNN and CBS; spent hours on the phone with me to be sure I get it all; and made himself available to the people he hurt, giving a ruthless accounting of his sins. He has no expectation that the truth will set him free, or serve as recompense for the past. “I’m just putting this out there [in hopes] that someone hears it and does something before a bunch of people die. The way these companies play you, chase and harass you till you’re worse than broke and get to thinking, ‘Maybe it would be better if I was gone.’”",https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-features/mobile-sports-betting-gambling-addiction-fanduel-draftkings-1235444172,Entertainment,BBC,"Paul Solotaroff,Eli Senor",https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/bet-the-devil-LEAD.jpg?crop=0px%2C1697px%2C1800px%2C1014px&resize=1600%2C900,2025-10-12T13:00:00+00:00,2eec81bda5622269601c6dcb02515557adfd2b80
4aec03e0ed9c,What You Tell an AI Chatbot Could One Day Be Evidence in a Criminal Trial,,"On Wednesday, the Department of Justice announced the arrest of Jonathan Rinderknecht, who was federally charged for setting the blaze that eventually became the massive and deadly Palisades Fire, which ravaged coastal communities of Los Angeles County throughout the month of January. Authorities mentioned various pieces of evidence that they said supported the case against Rinderknecht, but they spotlighted a particularly novel one : records of his exchanges with ChatGPT . The 29-year-old Florida man allegedly prompted OpenAI ‘s chatbot to create images of cities and forests engulfed in flames, told it about feeling “liberated” after burning a Bible, and, shortly after igniting a brush fire just after midnight on New Year’s Day, asked it, “Are you at fault if a fire is lift [sic] because of your cigarettes?” Rinderknecht has yet to enter a plea, but if he goes to trial, the case could offer a meaningful glimpse into how the proliferation of AI technology will affect criminal investigations and prosecutions in the future. Users have proven overly trustful of chatbots, treating them as therapists, confidants, and even romantic partners onto which they can unburden intimate secrets. The reality is that they are divulging sensitive information on platforms that offer no legal confidentiality, developed by companies that will readily turn their data over to law enforcement if served with a subpoena, warrant, or court order. A New Frontier All this makes chatbot records a potential bonanza for law enforcement, tech and legal experts tell Rolling Stone , perhaps more valuable than the text messages and social media footprints that currently serve as important areas of focus when authorities scrutinize individuals linked to a crime . Generative AI correspondence, too, is soon to be a regular part of criminal investigations and trials. “There is no doubt that AI chatbot logs are going to take center stage in evidentiary disputes across the nation,” says Kyle A. Valente, an attorney with the law firm Bressler Amery & Ross PC who published a paper on the topic last month. “Civil practitioners will want to obtain chat histories to show intent or motive in cases dealing with fraud, misrepresentation, breach of contract, and the like,” he says, while prosecutors are seeking to introduce these files to establish elements of a case such as mens rea , or a suspect’s knowledge of wrongdoing. Though a number of civil lawsuits related to user harm are currently pending against AI firms, criminal prosecutors have hardly begun to explore how they can leverage defendants’ chatbot usage to secure convictions. Valente cites one remarkable early precedent: a man from Roanoke, Virginia, was sentenced in September to 25 years in prison for first-degree murder after prosecutors argued that his messages with Snapchat ‘s My AI bot demonstrated premeditation in a 2023 slaying. Before fatally shooting another man in a petty dispute, the now convicted defendant, 18 years old at the time, told the bot he was going to “fight” and asked it, “What if I shot them if they step on my property with hostile intent?” (The chatbot replied that it could not “condone or encourage any violent or illegal behavior.”) ‘It’s Like Your Diary Times 10’ “DNA residue, fingerprints, everything you watch in all these crime shows pales in comparison to the private data that you have on your phone,” says Rob T. Lee, a digital forensics and AI expert at SANS Institute, a cybersecurity training cooperative. “What happens now with AI, you’re having a full conversation with these chatbots. It is no longer just a search for a topic.” Whereas criminal suspects in this past may have been incriminated by a Google query on, say, how to clean up bloodstains, a more comprehensive, detailed back-and-forth with a tool like ChatGPT gives investigators far more opportunities to prove intent and mindset, Lee explains. “All of that is logged, and it’s all sitting on servers,” he says. “It’s like your diary times 10.” “We saw this with social media, where all of a sudden, law enforcement started to understand that a lot of important, relevant evidence could be gleaned from social media posts and profiles,” says Meetali Jain, a tech and human rights lawyer who serves as director of the Tech Justice Law Project and is representing multiple parents in lawsuits alleging that AI products encouraged their children to commit suicide. “That became a standard part of a criminal investigation. I think we’re going to start to see that in this context too.” The difference, she says, is that this next development concerns “machine-generated outputs,” and there aren’t established rules around how this kind of material can or should be admitted as exhibits in court. “It’s very much a live issue,” Jain says. Valente concurs: “At this early juncture, the bounds are limitless until such a time as courts issue opinions that establish some framework for dealing with this type of evidence,” he says. A Fundamental Difference Vincent Conitzer, director of the Foundations of Cooperative AI Lab at Carnegie Mellon University and head of technical AI engagement at the University of Oxford’s Institute for Ethics in AI, also says that chatbot exchanges fundamentally differ from text messages with another person, who we would expect to take action to prevent a crime if told about it in advance. “Will we have similar expectations of a chatbot?” Conitzer asks. “Already the companies try to have guardrails so that their chatbots do not help someone commit a crime, though those guardrails are still very brittle.” Indeed, an NBC News report this week revealed that ChatGPT can be manipulated into giving directions on the assembly of chemical and biological weapons. And Matthew Livelsberger, the veteran who on New Year’s Day fatally shot himself in a Tesla Cybertruck parked in front of the Trump hotel in Las Vegas right before an incendiary device blew up the vehicle, used generative AI to help plan his attack. Lee notes that several AI companies have already indicated their ability to flag user activity that appears to foreshadow a crime. “They’re getting much better at detecting foreign adversaries using these systems for malicious ends, and I can only imagine that they’re doing similar for people [in the U.S.] that may be looking to kill or commit acts of terror,” he says. Human Review OpenAI has said it employs a human review team that is authorized to electively inform law enforcement when they come across content that “involves an imminent threat of serious physical harm to others.” How often they escalate to this level of alarm is unclear. “They’re not doing press releases on it,” Lee says, speculating that they prefer to spotlight efforts to disrupt state-affiliated threat actors in Russia, Iran, and China, “which is much easier to get a pat on the back for.” The major American AI players are much more tight-lipped, Lee says, on their ability to detect a possible school shooter, to take one example. And, as Jain points out, if they are picking up these warning signs, reporting them isn’t mandatory. “I think [the companies] are going to say, ‘Look, we can’t be responsible for what kinds of queries users pose to us through our chatbot, we can’t possibly know what he was going to do,’” Jain predicts. She is struck by the fact that when the Justice Department put forward its claims about how Rinderknecht had used ChatGPT before and during the Palisades Fire, they didn’t mention OpenAI or whether the program could have appeared to encourage “harm to others.” Chatbots are known to validate users’ obsessions and delusions , and most of the litigation around this phenomenon has so far pertained to self-harm, as in the suits Jain has brought against OpenAI and Character Technologies. The question of the role a chatbot might come to play in an episode of outward violence or destructive behavior is murkier still. “​​The focus is going to be on further substantiating the culpability of the individual, at the expense of really looking at how the companies designed their chatbots,” Jain says, likening the issue to entrapment, a scenario in which law enforcement induces someone to commit a crime. She envisions prosecutors homing in on a “gotcha moment” in a defendant’s chatbot logs, “without any sort of understanding of how the machine got to that output.” “I feel like it’s going to be a very one-sided story,” Jain adds. “I can’t imagine that a company is going to stick up for the rights of users.” Nevertheless, it seems there’s little the major AI players can do to avoid being drawn into criminal proceedings in the months and years ahead. Valente, for one, expects that their legal and compliance departments will take a “proactive” approach to the problem. What would that entail? “Revisiting privacy policies and updating terms and conditions,” he says. As always, the devil is in the fine print.",https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-features/chatbot-history-evidence-criminal-case-1235444944,Entertainment,BBC,Miles Klee,https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/ai-chatbot-logs-in-court.jpg?w=1600&h=900&crop=1,2025-10-11T14:54:26+00:00,4f82ed3df8908158028a9105a09b133a9ce160f8
a4ae316a5b1b,"Her Father Was a Notorious Serial Killer. Years After His Arrest, She’s Still Searching for Answers",,"For almost 30 years, the city of Wichita, Kansas was terrorized by a serial killer. He called himself BTK , a nickname patterned after the phrase “bind, torture, kill” — the signature way he would leave bodies for police to find. His victims varied, first a young family, then women of varying ages and economic backgrounds — sometimes going years between murders. Investigators were assigned and reassigned to the case, poring over clues and evidence. These included letters from BTK himself, taunting police on being unable to catch him. By 2005, BTK was considered one of the biggest cold cases in the entire state. Kerri Rawson — who had grown up in Wichita — was living in Michigan but hadn’t forgotten the moniker of the wanted murder. But when FBI agents showed up to her door on a snowy morning that February she couldn’t reconcile her knowledge of the serial killer with what the people in front of her were saying. BTK wasn’t a cold case anymore. A suspect had just been arrested, and it was her father, Dennis Rader. In June 2005, Rader pleaded guilty to 10 counts of first degree murder. He is incarcerated in the El Dorado Correctional Facility in El Dorado, Kansas , serving 10 consecutive life sentences. But for Rawson, her father’s secret double life — a religious family man in public and a sadistic serial killer in private — has haunted her since the police’s discovery. Now, she’s trying to reckon the man she knew with the murderer she despises. In the new Netflix documentary My Father, the BTK Killer, the investigators, media, neighbors walk through their memories of the search for BTK — all while Rawson tries to plan out what her future looks like without him. Here are four things we learned from the new Netflix documentary My Father, the BTK Killer . Stephen King’s interview about his book A Good Marriage inspired Kerri Rawson to break her family’s year long silence . Even after the FBI informed Rawson of her father’s arrest and history as a serial killer, there was a part of the Kansas native that didn’t believe her father could have done it. While reckoning with the news, neither Rawson nor her mother believed that police had the right person. Following the media storm, Rawson says in the documentary that she turned down major interviews with people like Diane Sawyer and Oprah. “I spent almost 10 years rotting inside after he was arrested. Not being able to speak, not thinking I was allowed to speak,” she says in the documentary. “In the Midwest code, you don’t ever air your dirty laundry publicly. You just keep it inside and you look appropriate on the outside.” But one night, while she was watching television, Rawson caught a 2014 interview with thriller author Stephen King . King was promoting his novella A Good Marriage , about a happy wife whose life is thrown into disarray when she discovers her husband is secretly a serial killer. King said he was inspired in part by Rader’s arrest, more specifically, by his ability to keep his murderous tendencies completely unknown to the rest of his family. Rawson felt like the book was exploitative of her father’s victims, and decided that it was finally time for her to share her own perspective. “I had been silent for so long,” she says. “And there was so much stuff that needed to come out.” Rader was known in his community as a kind and quiet man, but his family said he had a vicious temper. One of the biggest shocks after Rader’s arrest was how long the convicted killer was able to plan and execute serial killings in his own community without being arrested or even suspected. People in his community of Park City, Kansas — a small town outside Wichita — remembered Rader as a quiet, kind, and rule-following man. He worked as a compliance officer for the city, and was known by many people as the official dogcatcher. In addition to being a stickler for city ordinances, Rader was known to participate heavily in outside activities like leading his son’s Cub Scout group and doing administrative tasks at the Christ Lutheran Church. “He didn’t just fool his family,” family friend and neighbor Andrea Rogers says in the documentary. “He fooled a church. He fooled an entire city. He literally fooled everybody.” But even before his family was told about his extracurriculars, Rawson says that she, her mother, and brother were all aware that her father had an angry personality that the rest of the world couldn’t see. In the documentary, Rawson says that the family often left Rader choose everything from their activities to the movies they watched to where the children went in their free time, for fear of upsetting him. And they also knew that even the smallest of mistakes, like leaving their shoes out or someone taking his assigned seat at the kitchen table, could result in massive outbursts. “My father, on the outside, looked like a very well-behaved, mild-mannered man. But there’s these moments of Dad, [where] something will trigger him and he can flip on a dime,” Rawson says in the documentary. “And it can be dangerous.” Rader often used his family life as a cover for his murders . When police interviewed him following his arrest, Rader admitted that he used his family events as helpful cover for his murders, but noted that his busy schedule most likely kept him from killing more people. Though none of his family say they had any idea he was a serial killer, the clues were hidden in plain sight. When police first searched Rader’s house, they found his kill bag — a bag complete with a gun, ropes, and other break-in items — stored prominently in the entryway’s coat closet. In Rader’s office, evidence of his kills including personal items belonging to the victims, were kept accessible in an unlocked filing cabinet. Rader and his family were active and often took vacations and trips in popular tourist destinations like the Grand Canyon and the National Parks . They were also avid fishers, campers, and hikers, with Rawson noting she and her father both loved the outdoors. “He said later on that having kids slowed down his murders,” Rawson says in the documentary. “Dad said he got busy raising kids. I think he got busy chasing me.” One of the last letters of clues Rader sent police before his longest hiatus was mailed on the night of Rawson’s first birthday party. But many of those activities also helped Rader avoid initial suspicion in the murders. On Jan. 18, 1991, Rader went to a  Cub Scout event before sneaking away to kill 62-year-old Dolores Davis. After using his station wagon to store bodies and murder gear, he later gave it to Rawson in high school for her own personal use. “That was not okay,” Rawson says. Rawson helped police name Rader as the suspect for at least one additional murder . After Rawson learned that her father was the BTK killer, she says in the documentary that she went through a very long period of emotional upheaval. Days after Rader’s arrest, she and a large group of her extended family gathered in the same house, eating food and telling stories about their treasured memories while the media circus continued to swarm outside. Rawson says it was like a funeral but she still loved her father. Instead, she focused her anger on the media attention and people who were hounding her family. “Our lives were just gone,” she says in the documentary. “It was upheaval, totally insane. I was just mad at everybody.” After her father was convicted, Rawson reached out to him in prison and tried to continue some aspect of their relationship, letting him know she was always available to talk but that she desperately wanted answers. He didn’t answer her questions, but he did say he loved her and thought of her. Since Rawson and Rader had an open line of communication, police asked Rawson to aid them in finding if there were any more victims then the 10 he had claimed.  Rawson not only went through Rader’s personal notes and diaries, but met with him and asked him point blank about the possibility of other victims. Rader denied being involved. After going through his notes and personal belongings, police named Rader as the prime suspect in the 1976 disappearance of one other woman: 16-year-old Cynthia Kinney from Pawhuska, Oklahoma. Kinney was working at a laundromat when she went missing, a fantasy detailed extensively in one of Rader’s journals. Police have never found Kinney’s body, so any conviction would require stronger evidence linking Rader with Kinney. Rader still denies it. Rawson says she can’t reconcile her father with BTK — and she’s done trying to . According to Rawson, the Kansas native has spent much of her adult life trying to cope with the trauma of learning her father’s real nature. For a while, this was alleviated by trying to help police with their investigations, corresponding with her father, and working with organizations meant to help victims of violent and high profile crimes. In 2019, she wrote A Serial Killer’s Daughter: My Story of Faith, Love, and Overcoming , her first memoir. Her second, Breaking Free: Overcoming the Trauma of My Serial Killer Father , was published in 2023. Both of the books were national best sellers. But even after helping the police and victims advocacy groups, Rawson says she still struggled with her own repressed memories from her childhood. In the documentary, she describes having a period of night terrors and fearful periods where she was constantly paranoid of a home invasion. These lasted for months, often resulting in her wetting the bed and crying out for help. Now, Rawson thinks part of that may have been her somehow understanding her father’s actions. “I think my subconscious [has been] trying to get it out of me since I was a little girl,” she says. “Saying, ‘Hey, there’s a bad man in my house.’” Rader kept detailed notes about his victims and killings, but many of them were interspersed among writings about daydreams and fantasies. In one of his notebooks, Rawson found her own name next to a date and his codes for bondage and sex. Rawson confronted her father during a visit to his prison. He denied ever sexually assaulting her or any member of her family — saying he only fantasized about it — but Rawson says she exploded. She berated him about how intertwined his serial killing life and her life were. And when she was done, she left. She says the person sitting across from her at that table wasn’t a father she recognized. So she’s done spending so much time trying to make sense of why her father committed his crimes. Rawson says that she will always continue her work with victim advocacy groups, but for now, she’s exploring what her life, memories, and career look like without her father or his impact. At 80 years old, Rader is still serving consecutive life sentences and will never be released. Rawson doubts she will ever visit him again. “I’ll grieve those memories and that girl and that family. I lost all of it,” she says. “But I just didn’t really want to give him any of me anymore.”",https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-news/kerri-rawson-my-father-btk-serial-killer-kansas-documentary-1235443801,Entertainment,BBC,CT Jones,https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/My_Father_The_BTK_Killer.jpg?w=1600&h=900&crop=1,2025-10-11T14:30:00+00:00,223000a1e29f13b60d46c7cb7b230bded6837439
829c9f4048a8,Allen Iverson on Chilling With Biggie and Getting Way Too High,,"In the following excerpt from Misunderstood : A Memoir , NBA Hall of Famer Allen Iverson recounts how he wrestled with success, fame, and lofty expectations during his rookie season with the Philadelphia 76ers — while also enjoying the hell out of his rising celebrity. I was back in Cleveland for our first game after the All-Star Break. I had vowed I would show that crowd what’s up after they booed me. But I had a terrible game, and they booed me again. I hated the Cleveland fans at that point. That’s how it went for a little while — losses, negativity. For the first time in my life, it almost felt like I had lost my legs. I shot the ball terribly. I tried to distribute, but my teammates weren’t making anything either. It was like we had reentered that period where we lost 23 out of 24. The Sixers fans were getting pissed off at the losing too. The negative stories about me continued. I held a little press gathering a few days later, at a Reebok event, trying to turn the narrative around. I told these guys the same story, that I respected the legends who came before me. But then they switched it up and started asking me about rumors that I owned a gun in my name. I told them that I did, and that I had to protect myself. With that as the new focal point, it became more of Allen Iverson is a bad guy but add guns to the mix. Feeling like talking just made it worse, I told the media I was done with that shit. No more press availability. I remember a couple days later, after we won one against the Clippers, Pat Croce came up to me in the arena, and he was like, Chuck, you got to talk to these guys. So I agreed to do it, but I took one from the Coach Thompson playbook and said I would only answer questions about basketball. And that’s how I handled it for the rest of the season. It wasn’t just me feeling the heat. Johnny Davis’s job was rumored to be in trouble, and as the trade deadline approached, I think some dudes were actually hoping to get traded. All this shit hurt, but my life kept on being this dream. Reebok officially released The Question. The authentic me was front and center in the marketing campaign. Of course all my family and friends were wearing them. I wore them on the court for the rookie game, the red, white, and blue matching my Sixers uniform. Seeing them like that — on my feet, family and friends wearing them — was one thing, but I will never forget witnessing them out in the world for the first time. I was in my car, and a kid had the joints on. Just walking down the city streets. After I passed him in my car, I stopped and put the motherfucker in park. I just kept it there as I looked at the kid in my rearview. Kept my eyes on him until he walked out of sight. It might as well have been me I was looking at. Here I was, exactly a year removed from driving that first Mercedes off the lot. Three years removed from jail. Not even seven years removed from walking up to Bethel High, just hoping my name was on the list. Seven years removed from hustling. Eight, maybe nine years removed from swiping worms from the corner store and lifting loose change from cars in the mall parking lot. Here I was, in my Benz or my Rolls or whatever it was that day, watching my shoes accompanying this anonymous kid down the city streets. In spite of all the losing that season, I was loving my life. Makes me think of a conversation I had with my mom — years later, but I think about it a lot. I said to her, “I’m getting scared.” And she was like, “About what?” I said, “Everything is perfect right now. As good as it could be.” “What do you mean?” So I tried to explain it. “You know, I been with Tawanna, shit, my whole fucking life. If her day ain’t good, my day ain’t good. Everything is great with us, my kids are doing fine, my family is fine. All the money we have coming in. Everything is cool. But I’m scared.” “That don’t make no sense.” “Everything just seems too goddamn perfect. I feel like something bad is going to happen.” She just said, “Don’t you ever live your life like that. That’s a blessing, man, God is blessing you, that’s a part of being blessed: things going well in your life. Don’t get scared of that, don’t fucking jinx yourself to where something bad gotta be happening or feel like you got used to bad shit happening in life. You know, life is supposed to be fucking great. I know life is hard at times. But when it’s going good, that’s a blessing. It don’t always have to be bad.” So I always tried to enjoy the good times. But I admit, I was never confident they would continue. That’s one reason I think I played like I did, and maybe why I partied that way too. Like you never know how long it’s going to last. It seemed like it wasn’t supposed to happen in the first place. The Reebok Questions got released as planned, but they were hard to get your hands on at first. Everybody wanted them. I will never forget when I was in LA, and after a game, I heard I had a visitor. Came out the locker room, and there he was. Biggie. I was just like, “What the fuck you doing here?” He went, “I came to see you. I need to get me the Questions.” I had to act cool, having this idol waiting for me, to ask me for something. I was like, “I got you.” Then we chilled that night. And I made sure we sent them kicks, obviously. Man, when I got to the league, it was like a world opened up to me. When I tell you that I was going out with my friends to clubs, out late into the night, many times it wasn’t just us. I was chilling with the dudes I idolized, who, like I said, provided the soundtrack of my life. It started before the draft even. I had gone to hoop at Rucker Park, in Harlem, because you had to play there back then. You weren’t the real shit unless you did. When I showed up, all kinds of people came to see the show. That’s when I first met Biggie and Lil’ Cease from Junior M.A.F.I.A., dudes who’d already done exactly what we were dreaming of doing, conquering, getting rich, and bringing everyone with them. They’d made records. I was playing basketball. So after that with Biggie, we’d chill when I was in New York, or when he was in the same city I happened to be in. One night earlier that year, when I was in New York, me and some of my friends were invited to his recording studio. It’s one of those times it felt like I was dreaming. Everyone was smoking, chilling. At that particular point, I only smoked here and there, and even then, I only started from when I was at Georgetown. So I smoked a little that night, but then I started tripping. I remember I went to the bathroom, and I was wearing this Janet Jackson shirt, and the reflection just started freaking me out. Then I couldn’t find my way back down the hallway to the recording studio. Turned out what I smoked was some fucking hash. I really didn’t know what I was doing. So eventually I made it back after some worker found my ass and took me. Me and Ra and E were just sitting there, tripping, as we watched Biggie work on a couple tracks from Life After Death . At that point, it had been a minute since his last release, so this was going to be his next big one. That night, Biggie recorded parts of “You’re Nobody (Til Somebody Kills You)” and “My Downfall.” Ra and E were imagining making it in that world. I was just a fan watching this genius work, man. Flash forward to March 9, about a month after the All-Star Game, and we had a game in Washington. My mom came to DC to watch my homecoming. Remember, I had missed our first game in DC earlier that year, so now I got to play in front of everyone — the USAir Arena was as close as any NBA basketball arena was to Newport News and Hampton. My mom stayed in my hotel. I went out that night until late. After I had gotten to bed, my mom came and woke my ass up. “They killed your man!” I didn’t know what she was talking about. “Biggie dead.” I got up, shook. I had watched him record, gotten him my shoes. He’d been a model for us as we’d plotted getting out the shit. It was crushing. If anyone had been prepared for death, it was me. From all the dudes I’d seen get killed, Tony Clark and too many others to count, it’s fucked-up to say I was used to it. But I was used to it. Still, when you get the fuck out, like I did, and like Biggie had done before me, and it still goes that way? I thought about that shit all the time after that. And I always remembered when I was a kid, in Glen Gardens, with a barrel pressed to my head. Right before he died, they released “Hypnotize,” the first single off Ready to Die . Then at the end of that month, after his death, the “Hypnotize” video came out. It was so fucking epic, filmed with speedboats and helicopters in Miami Bay. The man had made it, was doing it over the top, just crushing it. Before it all got snatched away. They said he never got to watch the whole video. He definitely never got to see the whole album released. But if you watch that video close, you can see it. He’s wearing the motherfucking Questions.

d5dd7f80877b,‘Battlefield 6’ Is a Throwback Military Fantasy That’s Smart Enough to Play Dumb,,"Brooklyn’s on fire . The intermittent pops of muzzle fire are drowned out as tank treads grind the asphalt down Washington Street toward the East River waterfront, where a 100-year-old carousel lays in ruin. As U.S. forces lay waste to the tourist spots and halal trucks in a deadly skirmish with a fictional paramilitary cell, you can’t help but wince in horror. Thankfully, the scene isn’t something pulled from the daily news, even if it’s nightmarishly close to a future many Americans fear. Instead, the violent upheaval of New York City is just one of the backdrops for EA’s Battlefield 6 (out Oct. 10), where 64 players are competing to be king of the hill in a shockingly realistic first-person shooter. The phrase “realistic” is a little loaded; the sequences depicted aren’t exactly what anyone’s really expecting to see anytime soon. But they still hit close to home, and the heavy plodding of infantry and the high-tech physics of crumbling buildings make everything feel about as real as can be. While other games are trading in cartoonish action and power fantasy, Battlefield 6 ’s harrowing gameplay feels like a back-to-the-basics approach, even if it’s still this over the top. After taking a backseat to the juggernaut success of competitor Call of Duty for the last decade or so, Battlefield is back as arguably the most-anticipated military shooter of 2025. And with a pretty solid single-player campaign and best-in-class multiplayer mode that makes the horrors of war into a digestibly addictive romp, Battlefield 6 is a welcome sight, even if it frequently makes you want to close your eyes. Obama-era military machismo Although it’s tried many times over the years with sub-series like Bad Company , single-player story campaigns have never really been Battlefield ’s forte. The newest one isn’t revolutionary by any means; it’s mostly an excuse to show off high-fidelity, on-rails versions of locations used in multiplayer maps for some neat action set pieces. The paper-thin plot follows a group of U.S. Marines as they bounce around the world aiming to thwart the terrorism of a fictional private army called Pax Armata. The story is wall-to-wall clichés, with the playable bits serving as flashbacks to catch audiences up to the present, where the Marines are interrogating a shady government official about how the world went FUBAR. The core cast are forgettable, but the game pulls tricks from older-era Call of Duty titles like Modern Warfare and Black Ops by saddling players with alternating POVs of the events just long enough to learn someone’s name before you’re forced to live out their demise. Battlefield 6 ‘s character are one-dimensional stands-ins that get the job done. Electronic Arts Mechanically, most encounters are just a series of shooting galleries, which doesn’t really play to Battlefield ’s strengths. While some of the areas are relatively open, the forward momentum of the plot means there’s always a right and wrong way to go — although you’ll only find out which when an on-screen countdown yells to return to the combat zone. The level design occasionally takes inspiration from the multiplayer, where the solution to smoking out a sniper is usually to bring an entire building down. But often, it’s confusing in the main campaign. Players are told to clear out a three-story apartment, but basic rifle bullets are bringing the walls down around you, with unknown enemies appearing like a jump scare. The developers admirably tried to include the class system in the story, where each squad member serves a specific role like medic or engineer, but it mostly means that being shot will leave players laying around waiting for a somewhat dim AI partner to come revive them even while enemies are swarming the body. The speculative fiction plot remains politically neutral — there’s just good guys and bad ones. Electronic Arts The campaign is at its best when it’s showing off gorgeous destruction in scripted sequences. An early game HALO jump sees smoke and condensation caking on the player’s visor as they plummet in freefall toward a warzone in Gibraltar. Another has the squad sneaking through the alleyways of Cairo using night vision goggles while avoiding a protest that’s boiling over into a full-blown riot in the streets. The big selling point from the marketing materials is the Brooklyn-based mayhem that takes up a big chunk of the plot in the game’s first act. Bringing the battle home for players to storm brownstones in Brooklyn Heights or desperately traverse a crumbling Manhattan Bridge is effectively scary — for most people. Despite its very clearly apolitical speculative fiction slant, it’s hard not to see parallels between U.S. Armed Forces occupying a liberal city in a video game and what’s happening daily on CNN. The cognitive dissonance is handwaved by sticking the blame on a made-up, morally compromised private army, but it’s obvious that the experience works both ways regardless of your real-life political leaning. For a certain type of MAGA-minded American, tearing through Grand Army Plaza with a 50-cal is bound to be virtual Viagra. For others, it’s a too-close-to-home horror show, although with a healthy dose of NIMBYism — it’s a relief to jump back to Egypt or Iran to engage in the same level of wanton carnage on foreign soil that pop culture has desensitized. The deft trick is convincing you that, no matter why you like it, it’s okay because you’re the good guy. Domestic warfare leans into shock value, but is effective nonetheless. Electronic Arts At its peak, Battlefield 6 ’s story mode operates on the same wavelength as late-2000s military shooters, where morally gray acts of war are a dime a dozen, punctuated by the shock value of domestic threats played out with an immersive POV. Multi-level multiplayer mayhem Despite its surprisingly competent story campaign, the real draw of Battlefield is the multiplayer — and it’s rarely been better than in this new game. Stripping all the fat and gimmicks from recent entries like Battlefield 2024 (2021) and Battlefield 1 (2016), the gameplay style has gone back to emulate the design of the series’ best installments like Battlefield 3 and 4 (2011 and 2013). Since its earliest entries, the defining factor of Battlefield ’s competitive multiplayer has been its sheer scope. Originally 24, then 32, and now a 64-player assault on the senses, there’s really nothing else like what EA’s military shooter series offers. It’s an experience where users can start a match on foot, racing headfirst into a hailstorm of bullets, only to end up in a jeep, tank, or attack chopper raining fire on the roof of an apartment complex moments later. The single-player set pieces go big, but the multiplayer can match it. Electronic Arts The class-based system encourages teamwork; the only way to successfully take control of a designated zone is to throw bodies at it, but it’s easy to get cut down by sniper and artillery fire. The smartest way forward is to coordinate and play your role — whether that’s Assault, Engineer, Support, or Recon. Each class has its own unique abilities: Assault lets players run point with heavy firepower and improved mobility; Engineers can fix friendly vehicles or do extreme damage to the opposition’s; Support can resupply ammunition and revive fallen allies instantly; Recon allows players to spot and mark enemies for higher field visibility. Unlike Call of Duty , where everyone is essentially their own one-man Rambo, there’s more to Battlefield than just sprinting around endlessly killing foes. There is, of course, basic deathmatch, which is playable in both a classic two team setup or in smaller squads of four where the groups are all racing to rack up 50 kills for the win. But the real Battlefield experience is the tug-of-war around capturing locations in prolonged battles of attrition. Modes like Conquest, Breakthrough, and Domination are all different variations on this concept with minor tweaks to the ruleset that defines each one. Conquest is a large-scale skirmish where two teams fight to control different flagged points around the map (labeled A to F) where holding each point for an extended period dwindles the opposition’s score until it reaches zero. Domination is the same, except with less points to capture and smaller arenas for more hectic action. The modes aren’t that varied, but the core experience remains unparalleled. Electronic Arts Breakthrough is similar, but rather than having everyone on equal footing bouncing around points on loop, it’s a more direct attacker and defender scenario where one team pushes forward, and the other must hold the line. Rush mode is the same, but smaller, and focuses the push on destroying objectives rather than just flooding the areas to control them. While most of the multiplayer modes are different flavors of the same idea, there’s a perpetually improvisational element that makes Battlefield 6 shine where other shooters falter. If a team is failing to take a point because their infantry is being bottlenecked into doorway that becomes a kill box, you can always just remove the entire wall with an RPG. Suddenly, the levy’s broken and everyone can rush. While the slower speed and emphasis on physics, from the long-distance drop of bullet trajectories to the breakable foundations of structures, are a huge part of Battlefield ’s DNA, there’s also just an inherent silliness to some of the tactics that stir joy. Playing to your class strengths is the key to victory. Electronic Arts Playing as a Support medic means you can gain tons of experience and turn the tide of battle by just sprinting around a crash site defibrillating a dozen downed soldiers with a slap in the face, screaming, “On your feet, soldier!” As an engineer, it’s a thrill to ride shotgun in a helicopter just holding down the repair button as a simple blowtorch keeps the bird alive despite heavy fire turning its walls to Swiss cheese. It’s the balance of realism and gaminess that just neatly threads the needle. Nowadays, everyone’s got a gimmick. In the arms race for audience’s undivided attention, both single-player and competitive games have become their own self-perpetuating ecosystems. Everything is bigger, louder, and packed to the brim with pop culture IP skins just to get people to bite. By comparison, Battlefield 6 practically feels quaint. It’s an all-meat and potatoes action shooter that sticks to a 20-year-old playbook, both in how it plays and how it blindly sidesteps any real point of view on its amoral militaristic jingoism. With how overwhelming the noise in both gaming and reality has become, it’s a frankly welcome distraction.

968f250d53f5,The Radical Empathy of a Low-Key Chat Show,,"“On some levels, I understand that this is like a breakup.” So said Marc Maron on his podcast last week, monologuing in his garage for a final time. WTF With Marc Maron wrapped its 16-year run yesterday; the comedian interviewed Barack Obama, a conversation recorded in Obama’s office. The chat was something of a victory lap for Maron, who made headlines for interviewing the then-president 10 years prior . (Back then, the pair met on the host’s home turf.) But, always conscious of WTF ’s defining emotional intimacy, he also made sure to give his listeners one more unfiltered stream of consciousness. “I live for connection,” he said during the penultimate episode. “I live for it because I need it to know that I exist.” Maron chased this desire for nearly two decades, his podcast charting his path: from a semi-floundering, twice-divorced, 40-something comedian trying his hand in a nascent medium, to the multi-talented performer he is now. He has developed into a well-regarded character actor; his stand-up is more popular than ever; and WTF became the preeminent chat show of a generation. Since 2009, Maron has evolved the interview format—and his approach has been much copied, if never quite equaled. Not one to stay comfortable, Maron ended WTF on his own terms. After almost 1,700 episodes, he explained in an interview yesterday, he and his longtime producer, Brendan McDonald, were ready to be done. The host expounded upon that point in his last monologue. “I earned a living, I saved some money, but I think I missed a lot of life while I was in it,” Maron told listeners. His self-reflection was ultimately triumphant, but kept the tone that endeared him to his fans over the years: a familiar mix of wry self-awareness and gallows humor. Read: Marc Maron has some thoughts on that I started listening to WTF shortly after it began, as podcasting was finding a wider audience. I was barely aware of Maron, though he’d been performing for almost 20 years by then. He was likely best known to most for his HBO special or as a regular guest on Late Night With Conan O’Brien ; his brand of comedy was caustic and personal, blending confessions about love and relationships with impassioned political awareness. A career built on vulnerability was likely key to his unwitting success as an interviewer. Maron found his big break after a turbulent run in radio anchoring a slew of programs on the progressive station Air America. After yet another of his shows was canceled, he retained his keycard and started recording his own show in the station’s studios. Thus, he created WTF , despite barely knowing what a podcast was. Maron moved to Los Angeles shortly thereafter and established a more recognizable milieu—recording out of his garage in Highland Park, surrounded by his pet cats and artwork sent to him by fans. The majority of his early guests were comedians, most of them his peers on the stand-up circuit, such as Janeane Garofalo or Todd Barry. Maron interspersed this lineup with younger faces on the scene that he might regard skeptically. (He memorably didn’t jibe with Nick Kroll’s stories of a happy childhood.) Within a year, the names started to get bigger. His 67th episode was with Robin Williams, an interview that to this day demonstrates everything WTF could bring to the table. Williams was introspective about his own mental-health battles and his history with lifting jokes from other comedians in the ’80s; the electricity between host and guest crackled the entire time. The DIY style, down to the unvarnished location and simple recording equipment, would lull guests into a sense of security. The newness of the medium, too, was beneficial. With Maron, artists of all levels of celebrity felt able to speak more candidly than they ever would with a journalist or on a talk show. “What helps him,” the filmmaker Judd Apatow told The New York Times in 2011, “is the fact that people mistakenly think that no one is going to listen to it, when in fact a ton of people listen to it, and it will last forever.” Apatow was one of WTF ’s most devoted fans; he appeared during the show’s final weeks to play clips from the host’s most famous interviews, spurring further musings. The clearest takeaway from that greatest-hits episode was that, even as Maron has grown in fame and expanded his rolodex, his conversational approach has never really changed. Maron always went for a brash, chatty kind of familiarity, picking at the issues that fascinate him most—family trauma, addiction, romantic tsuris, and a pursuit of authenticity in art. Read: Marc Maron’s brilliant mistakes As Maron tackled chats with almost all of his comedy idols over the years (and sometimes grilled his peers, such as the stand-ups Carlos Mencia and Gallagher), the program survived by broadening its remit. Maron disarmed musicians, actors, and filmmakers too—some of them plugging projects, others simply finding themselves in Maron’s garage out of intrigue or respect. When Obama first entered the “cat ranch” in 2015, it felt like a true watershed for podcasting as a whole. It was a sign that this was a world important people wanted to engage with, one that went beyond niche comedy fans. Since then, the platform Maron helped create—the low-key chat show—has exploded into an industry worth billions. Comedians of all stripes now host back-and-forth chats, though few display the compassion Maron is known for. WTF has remained independent through it all, but Maron has (as is his wont) taken to decrying podcast trends he considers frightening. None has seemed to worry him more than the emergence of the “manosphere,” whose most popular figureheads have found a home in podcasting. “We helped unleash an exciting type of delivery system for pure self-expression,” Maron wrote in a newsletter this summer , reflecting on the growth in his field. “Sadly, on some level, we also unleashed a format that can be used for dubious means.” His critique of the medium, even as he winds down his show, is reflective of Maron’s tenacity. He cannot help but charge at the topics that incense him the most. Maron’s interest in the ways political winds have shifted since he first started podcasting is what made his final choice of guest interesting to me. Some fans might have been disappointed that he didn’t wrap it up with a personal hero he’d never spoken to, such as Bob Dylan or Tom Waits. Inviting Obama back was a recognition of a groundbreaking moment for WTF , yes, but it also helped underline the host’s own anxieties. Maron, in recent years, frequently groused about the state of the country and the erosion of democracy. His conversation with the former president was professional and focused on one of Maron’s favorite subjects, the importance of human connection. It wasn’t the best episode of WTF . It was, however, WTF and Maron at their purest: concerned, empathetic, and punctuated with grouchy chuckles—not to mention just a little bit laced with doom.",https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/2025/10/marc-maron-wtf-podcast-ending-final-episode/684562,Culture,BBC,David Sims,https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/HX-m-SeH4j46Q_JlSWgi1Q-nfOw=/0x61:2876x1559/1200x625/media/img/mt/2025/10/2025_10_14_maron_1/original.jpg,2025-10-14T23:11:39+00:00,63cccfc826f7b0e161bf46c661c404ba829c5207
3e56bee86ed4,A Warning for the Modern Striver,,"Restlessness is deeply rooted in American mythology. We are a country of pilgrims, engaged in a lifelong search for what Ralph Waldo Emerson called an “original relation to the universe”—a unique understanding of the world that doesn’t rely on the traditions or teachings of past generations. Those who internalize this expectation will walk, trek, and seek—anything to shed an inherited skin and find an undiscovered self they can inhabit. If only skin, inherited or not, were so easy to shed. As Emerson wrote, “My giant goes with me wherever I go.” Few have embodied this supposedly American quality with more complexity than the writer Peter Matthiessen. And few have captured it with more clarity than Lance Richardson in his new biography of Matthiessen, True Nature . Richardson portrays the peripatetic life of Matthiessen—a celebrated author, magazine editor, and undercover agent who died in 2014—not as an eclectic series of adventures but as a single, 86-year spiritual quest. As he writes, Matthiessen’s “inner journey determined the choices he made throughout his long life; it is the string on which the various beads of his career were strung.” Matthiessen fled his monied upbringing in a flawed yet fascinating attempt to escape the person the world expected him to be. The central project of Matthiessen’s existence was a relentless, often painful attempt to locate what, quoting Zen Buddhists, he called a “true nature”—an authentic core beneath the layers of identity that he had received or constructed. His life story provides a warning for today’s perpetually dissatisfied strivers: mainly members of the tech or business elite who have made a name for themselves, only to still feel empty and insecure. Many use their considerable resources to set out for other territories in search of something they’re unlikely to find. Read: You don’t know yourself as well as you think you do Like many pilgrimages, Matthiessen’s journey began with a foundational trauma. Born in 1927, he had a storybook childhood on New York’s Fishers Island that was ruptured one summer by an incident on his father’s boat. The young Matthiessen had been learning to swim, so his father took him out to the harbor and threw him overboard to see if the lessons had stuck. As Richardson writes, Matthiessen made the mistake of clinging to his father’s shirt as he was thrown and nearly broke his arm on the side of the boat. He would later call this humiliation “the opening skirmish in an absolutely pointless lifelong war” with his family, and his adulthood was a series of escapes from that original wound. He fled to Paris, the classic expatriate move, but did so under bizarre circumstances—co-founding The Paris Review while serving as an agent for the CIA. Thoreau went to Walden Pond to flee a society he saw as corrupt; Matthiessen, for his part, went to the center of the establishment’s undercover operations to fund and facilitate his own existential escape. Jill Krementz The only writer to ever win National Book Awards for both fiction and nonfiction, Matthiessen was an architect of the postwar intellectual world, a contemporary of giants such as Norman Mailer, James Baldwin, and William Styron. His peers often waged their philosophical battles in the public squares of New York and Washington, but Matthiessen grew wary of the ego and performance required of the literary lion. Instead he traveled to the mountains of Nepal in search of snow leopards, and deep into China and Mongolia to catch a glimpse of the rarest cranes on Earth. But what he was really searching for was far more personal. Matthiessen’s pursuits weren’t solely internal; his work was also a very public counterpoint to the materialism and social conformity that he believed defined the second half of 20th-century America. His seminal book, Wildlife in America , published in 1959, was a meticulously researched history of the natural world and the devastating effects of human activity. Richardson rightly calls it “a landmark in nature writing,” which predated Rachel Carson’s Silent Spring . Matthiessen’s search for a preindustrial Eden also drives The Snow Leopard , his best-known work. On its surface, the book is the account of his two-month trek into Nepal’s Himalayas with the naturalist George Schaller, in 1973. But it is also a record of what Matthiessen called “a true pilgrimage, a journey of the heart” as he grieved the recent death of his wife. The hunt for the elusive, almost mythical snow leopard becomes a metaphor for the search for spiritual enlightenment, a release from the travails and humiliations of everyday human life. I first read The Snow Leopard when I was 20. It filled me with the misguided but tantalizing belief that a life of meaning was to be found elsewhere . It inspired my own pilgrimage to the Alps, retracing the trails that Friedrich Nietzsche hiked while writing his greatest work, Thus Spoke Zarathustra ; I sought the kind of authenticity that seemed impossible to find in a comfortable American suburb. The journey was enabled by a scholarship to a good school—a form of privilege that was almost entirely lost on me. Matthiessen’s profound and lonely meditations at 17,000 feet were, similarly, made possible by National Geographic funding, a name that opened doors, the very worldly security he was trying to transcend. Read: A reality check for tech oligarchs Perhaps he understood, on some level, the irony. Richardson writes that in the Amazon, many years before his subject traveled to Nepal, Matthiessen had encountered a genuine wanderer, a French Canadian drifter named Johnny Gauvin, and felt a sudden, uncomfortable self-awareness. Displacement and its attendant poverty were Gauvin’s way of life. Matthiessen realized that he was no authentic man of the wilderness, but an affluent visitor. “It’s a disturbing quality, and one that induces a certain self-consciousness about one’s eyeglasses, say, or the gleam of one’s new khaki pants,” he wrote in The New Yorker in 1961. Pilgrimages sometimes cause collateral damage too. In later life, he admitted that it may have been a mistake to leave his 8-year-old son so soon after the death of his wife to embark on the Himalayan expedition. Matthiessen’s example provides a powerful archetype for the modern day. The tech billionaire who flies to space seeking the “overview effect” is in search of something beyond the ken of the material world, which he has already conquered. The annual ritual of Burning Man sees wealthy people enact a temporary shedding of their consumerist skin, even if getting there requires enlarging one’s carbon footprint. The Silicon Valley executive who flies to Peru for an ayahuasca retreat is on a journey Matthiessen would have recognized intimately. Long before embarking on his formal Zen training, Matthiessen was an early psychonaut, experimenting with LSD in the 1960s. In search of mind-altering effects, he sought a chemical shortcut to the dissolution of the ego, a forced glimpse of the “true nature” that his privilege and ambition otherwise obscured. Matthiessen’s path from psychedelics to the rigorous discipline of Zen meditation shows what a genuine spiritual journey looks like: It is extremely difficult, deeply private, and never-ending. There is no shortcut. Jill Krementz Did Matthiessen ever find what he was looking for? Richardson’s elegant and rigorous biography wisely leaves the question open. But what it does make clear is that “true nature” is not a stable or permanent destination. It is a process, an experience, a temporary vision, an opening caused by a sudden confrontation with the world beyond us. Later in life, as Richardson writes, Matthiessen compared it to a tiger jumping into a quiet room. Reflecting on his tiger moment—a vision of his dying wife experienced in a sesshin , an intense form of Buddhist meditation—Matthiessen noted that “for the first time since unremembered childhood, I was not alone, there was no separate ‘I.’ Wounds, anger, ragged edges, hollow places were all gone, all had been healed; my heart was the heart of all creation.” But this beautiful instant is, by definition, temporary. Matthiessen, ultimately, refused to fit into any tidy box. He was an environmental activist who hobnobbed with the jet set, a devoted Buddhist who wrestled with a titanic ego, a man who knew that all things ultimately return to nature but fought against death to the very end. Matthiessen embodied many ironies, but one might feel particularly evergreen: The conditions that make possible a search for existential fulfillment are often what make it so very difficult to find. ​When you buy a book using a link on this page, we receive a commission.

Sign up to get “Dear James” in your inbox. Dear James, Every Thursday for the past decade, I’ve sat with the same group of guys for a beer after work. I don’t think any of them has changed a bit in 10 years. Nothing. They’ve done nothing to grow themselves or their talents. Each one of them, if they were to die today, would get nearly the same eulogy: Nice man. Worked hard. Loved his children. Nothing wrong with any of that. Or is there? I love them—and also admit that I’m judging them. I can’t help wondering if they feel any compulsion to better themselves, to help their neighbors, to serve others. What do you think is our obligation to think of people beyond ourselves? Dear Reader, Here’s a question for you. Do you really love these guys? Do you appreciate each one in his radiant singularity, while knowing in your heart that behind and beyond this singularity you share the same immortal, compassionate essence? Can you look at any one of your buddies holding a beer and getting louder (or quieter) as the evening progresses, and recognize his struggle as a child of God in a fallen world? Probably not, right? Because if you loved them like that, you’d know that plenty has happened in their lives in 10 years, and that they have most certainly changed or been changed. Nature is a Heraclitean fire, as the poet said: Everything’s moving, burning, rushing, altering its state. And we drink beer with our buddies—or I do—partly to slow it all down. To anchor myself woozily in space with dudes I love. Heraclitus told us that you can never step in the same river twice; you can definitely step in the same bar twice. You don’t have to love everybody, of course. There’ll be people for whom you have only one beer’s worth of love in you, and that’s fine. But these guys, you’ve been with them for a while: You have, as Bodhi says in Point Break , “shared time.” So, go deeper with your drinking buddies. Drink more, if necessary. Shift gears, drop down, ask the questions, make the confessions. Find out how everyone’s really doing. Crack open Thursday night like a cosmic egg. After that, you can address your own feeling of frustration: your sense that, day to day, the richer and wilder part of life is going unattended. This is very important. What is your neglected talent? Do you want to grow and serve? This country is full of holes—places where the need is so great that, for a willing and courageous person, it is literally impossible to be superfluous. There’s one in your neighborhood, for sure.

4001217d268b,The Drink That Americans Won’t Give Up Without a Fight,,"Coffee is in trouble. Even before the United States imposed tariffs of 50 percent on Brazil and 20 percent on Vietnam—which together produce more than half of the world’s coffee beans—other challenges, including climate-change-related fires, flooding, and droughts, had already forced up coffee prices globally. Today, all told, coffee in the U.S. is nearly 40 percent more expensive than it was a year ago. Futures for arabica coffee—the beans most people in the world drink—have increased by almost a dollar since July . And prices may well go up further: Tariffs have “destabilized an already volatile market,” Sara Morrocchi, the CEO of the coffee consultancy Vuna, told me. This is a problem for the millions of people who grow and sell coffee around the world. It is also a problem for the people who rely on coffee for their base executive functioning—such a problem that Congress recently introduced a bipartisan bill to specifically protect coffee from Trump’s tariffs. Coffee is a bit of a funny place from which to start trying to legislate against import taxes. Many , many foods and drinks are currently being tariffed to outer space, but coffee has basically no nutritional value and plenty of functional substitutes—walk into any gas station and you will see a wall full of energy drinks in every flavor, color, and chemical composition. We do not need coffee. But of course we need it. This is precisely why Ro Khanna—the Northern California Democrat who is sponsoring the bill along with Don Bacon, a Republican from Nebraska—introduced the No Coffee Tax Act, he told me. He had been talking a lot on cable news about the dangers posed by tariffs, but the message wasn’t getting through. Coffee is a vivid and concrete way into a broader conversation about what import taxes actually do . “This is something that a lot of people have in their house,” he said. “They’ve noticed that it’s more expensive. The cost of coffee really matters to people.” He pointed out that Americans have historically proved themselves willing to go to war over high taxes on what’s in their mug in the morning, and that President Richard Nixon, when he imposed wide-ranging tariffs in 1971, exempted coffee . Read: The quest to make the best worst cup of coffee Coffee is fixed in our culture, our economy, our rituals, and our brain chemistry. It is the country’s most consumed beverage aside from water, and its psychoactive ingredient, caffeine, is by far the most popular drug on Earth. On any given day, an American is likelier to drink coffee than they are to exercise, pray, or read for pleasure. The U.S. has more Starbucks locations than public libraries. Coffee gave us the Enlightenment , and insurance , and the most puissant bop of summer 2024 . It is so crucial to the machinery of capitalism that many employers give it away , like pens or any other essential office supply. It is the only consumable I can think of that people regularly joke about dying without (which is funny because, again, it provides nothing our bodies actually need to live). It is the thing in a big carafe at every meeting, and on the menu at nearly every restaurant, and built into our language as a widely understood shorthand for “having a conversation with another person.” It is also a fascinating symbol of the interdependence, and the limitations, of an internationalized food system and the free-trading global order. “Coffee is a good way to think about how the world works,” the author and food historian Augustine Sedgewick told me when I called him to chat about it. Aside from on a few comparatively tiny farms in Hawaii, California, and Puerto Rico, coffee doesn’t grow in the United States: We cannot make the drink that we cannot live without. And though we expect coffee to be cheaply and abundantly available, its production is tremendously costly and difficult, even before tariffs. Read: Capitalism’s favorite drug If human beings weren’t so addicted to it, coffee would make no sense as a mass-produced crop. It prefers rocky soil and high altitudes, where “mechanization becomes very difficult,” as Morrocchi put it; for that reason, coffee is typically picked by hand. After that, it is dried, hulled, cleaned, sorted, graded, and roasted—often by people making poverty wages , some of whom are children —before it is shipped around the world, and even then it is not yet ready to drink. Coffee is the driver of a great deal of work , but also the product of it. Eleven dollars is an awful lot to pay for a latte, but also not very much at all when you consider what goes into one. “We really have a really strange disjuncture,” Sedgewick told me, “where coffee is both too cheap and way too expensive.” Sedgewick’s excellent book Coffeeland traces coffee’s centuries-long role in the exploitation of millions of workers in Central and South America and beyond; he knows more than anyone I’ve ever talked to about the historical problems with the beverage and the industry that produces it. But he’s still human: He cherishes a well-made quad cappuccino—though, “at some point relatively recently,” he told me, “that became a $10 drink.” He has cut back, begrudgingly. He loves the caffeine, obviously (“I hate to work as much as anyone else”), but he also loves the ritual of it, the way it thrusts him out into the world in the morning. Sedgewick stopped short of saying something such as Coffee brings us together , probably because that is a cliché, even if it is true. Everything he or you or I have ever eaten, we have eaten because someone—probably someone we will never meet—picked or processed or nurtured it, and then someone else prepared it. All food is the product of a colossal global apparatus designed to make pleasure and sustenance accessible; coffee, because it requires so much hands-on labor, is even more a product of it. Needing it makes us need other people. “Our lives depend on the lives of others,” Sedgewick told me, whether they live a hemisphere away or work at the Starbucks down the block.

8b88d06f9cd7,Eight Romance Novels for Romance Skeptics,,"Friends become lovers. Enemies become lovers. Former lovers get a second chance together. Arranged marriages generate real feelings. A human falls in love with a high lord of the fae. These are just a few of the plots readers can find in modern romance novels, which vary in tone, setting, and characters but are united by one key characteristic: a central love story that culminates in the all-important HEA (happily ever after, for the uninitiated). Everything leading up to that—the meet-cute, the first kiss, the third-act breakup—is left to the author. In recent years, the expansion of the format, and the plot freedom that followed, have led to a wider diversity of stories for readers who might want something other than the typical supermarket paperback offerings . As Adriana Herrera, a best-selling author of more than a dozen romances, told me, “The great thing about romance is that there is literally a writer or a book for every single reading taste in the moment.” There are historical romances, as well as romances set in futuristic dystopias. There are cozy romances and dark romances. There are holiday romances, cowboy romances, hockey romances. In other words, anyone open-minded enough to set aside popular preconceptions about the genre really can find their perfect match. The eight books below are all absorbing enough to draw in longtime romance fans and newbies alike. Although their protagonists must walk their own tangled paths to get to their HEA, each book offers the same reassuring guarantee: Everything will work out in the end. We Could Be So Good , by Cat Sebastian Nick is a newspaper beat reporter and a gay man in the 1950s who’s determined to keep his personal and professional lives separate. Andy, the son of the paper’s owner, has just been dumped, leaving him in need of somewhere to stay while he learns the ins and outs of his father’s business. Naturally, he ends up crashing at Nick’s apartment. As any romance reader could guess, their forced proximity leads to sexual tension, along with confusion—are they friends? Might they be more than friends? The two present a classic example of what’s known in the genre as a “grumpy-sunshine” pairing, in which Andy’s relentless optimism becomes so irresistible that it brightens Nick’s serious nature. In a refreshing turn, even though Sebastian’s protagonists are queer men living in a homophobic era, the book is more sweet than angsty, spending less time on whether two men can build a life together than on whether these particular two men want to. Bringing Down the Duke , by Evie Dunmore Dunmore’s A League of Extraordinary Women series begins in 1879, at the opening of Oxford’s first women’s college (though no degrees would be awarded to women for several decades). Annabelle is selected to attend with a scholarship from a suffragist society. Her advocacy work, aiming to pass the Married Women’s Property Act, puts her in the path of Sebastian, a powerful duke who is working, at Her Majesty’s request, to defeat the progressives in Parliament. Their run-ins quickly set off sparks, and as they spend more time in each other’s company, a mutual respect develops. Although Dunmore’s fictionalization of their conflict elides some of the very real historical stakes for British women, the couple’s genuine tenderness, in between and even during their arguments, makes the story—and their eventual relationship—truly come alive. Read: The publishing industry’s most swoon-worthy genre Book Lovers , by Emily Henry City slicker visits a small town, falls in love with a local shop owner, and learns to appreciate the simple life: Most of us have heard the story before, and Nora, a literary agent in New York, wants no part of it. (In a hilarious twist, she’s been dumped no fewer than three times by boyfriends whose small-town sojourns became permanent.) Her happily married sister, Libby, is determined to change Nora’s mind, and books them a girls’ trip to the town of Sunshine Falls, the setting of a recent best seller by one of Nora’s clients. As the pair work through a to-do list of Hallmark-movie moments (get a makeover, try to save a small business), Libby’s scheming is both successful and not: Nora falls in love, but not with their storybook location or a local eligible bachelor. Instead, she finds herself drawn to a surly book editor she knows from back home, who also happens to be visiting. Ultimately, Henry layers the traditional romance with a love story between the sisters. Credit The Duke Heist , by Erica Ridley Yes, another duke. Historical-romance authors love the British peerage system so much that bookstore shelves groan with many, many more dukedoms than the two dozen or so that actually existed in the United Kingdom of the 19th century. But if readers can suspend their disbelief about that, then surely the premise of Ridley’s charming Bridgerton –meets– Boxcar Children series is not too far a stretch: The late, eccentric Baron Vanderbean has left his sizable estate to the half dozen previously unrelated orphans he adopted. Now grown, the siblings use their fortune, along with their own peculiar talents—disguises, forgery, weapons handling—to lead Robin Hood–esque missions throughout London. In the course of one such quest, Chloe takes off in the getaway carriage—accidentally trapping a duke named Lawrence inside. Lawrence is entranced by Chloe, and she by him. There’s just one problem: He needs to marry an heiress to revitalize his destitute estate, and she’s masquerading as a poor orphan until she can safely recover a lost family heirloom. Thankfully, the misunderstandings get sorted out, and everyone gets what they want in the end. Party of Two , by Jasmine Guillory Picking a favorite book by Guillory is like picking a favorite cookie. They’re all sweetly satisfying; it just depends on what flavor you’re in the mood for. Perhaps you’re interested in a fake-dating ruse that turns into real love. Maybe you want two rivals to realize how thin the line is between hate and love . In Party of Two —the fifth novel in a series featuring the same group of friends—the protagonist, Olivia, has to navigate the spotlight that comes with dating a senator without dulling her own ambitions. What makes Guillory’s characters shine is their passion: for their work (some, including Olivia, are lawyers, as the author herself once was), for improving their communities, and for the simpler pleasures in life, which here mostly take the form of good food. Olivia and Max meet at a hotel bar, where she’s enjoying an ice-cold martini with her Caesar salad and fries. They strike up a conversation about dessert. Later, he sends a cake to ask her on a date. The whole book offers a feast for both the heart and the stomach. Read: How to write consent in romance novels The Very Secret Society of Irregular Witches , by Sangu Mandanna If you take out the witches, the world Mandanna has created is remarkably similar to our own. Even among those with magical abilities, familiar emotions and conflicts tend to surface. Mika is a lonely young woman: Her parents died when she was little, and the aunt who raised her taught her to conceal her powers for safety. The only place she lets them loose is online, where Mika, like so many people, can be whoever she wants. Eventually, her internet fame brings her to a remote spot on the British seaside to guide three young witches, all orphans like her. There she meets Jamie, a librarian who is determined to keep the girls safe in his own, non-magical way. Set in a world where extraordinary abilities mostly bring fear and loneliness, Mandanna’s tale is a cozy meditation on trust and chosen family. One Last Stop , by Casey McQuiston Most romance novels have two main characters. One Last Stop arguably has three: August, Jane, and the New York City subway system. All August wants when she moves to Brooklyn is a fresh start; she doesn’t expect the city to make her dreams come true, as some other transplants might. And yet it keeps forcing its magic on her: She lucks out in meeting roommates and co-workers who become real friends, and she keeps running into the same gorgeous girl, Jane, on the train. They fall for each other, and August begins to look forward to the otherwise-tedious task of commuting—until she realizes that their encounters aren’t merely the product of chance. The rest of the story is best uncovered without too much foreknowledge, but it’s safe to say that McQuiston’s tale is part love story and part love letter to the quirks and wonders of public transportation. Read: A political rom-com that feels ripped from a bygone era Small Town Girl , by LaVyrle Spencer While researching the country-music career of her main character, Spencer interviewed Reba McEntire to understand the life of an industry star, and the parts of this 1997 novel set in Nashville feel like a behind-the-curtain peek at Music Row. But when Tess—known as “Mac” to colleagues and fans, if not to her family—is forced to take time off from recording her latest album to care for her mother after surgery, she struggles to fit into the role of the novel’s title. At home, she falls back into childhood dynamics with her mother and sisters. Adding to her disorientation is Kenny, the nerdy boy next door who’s now a single father and beloved member of the community. When Tess takes on the role of mentoring Kenny’s daughter, a talented country singer in her own right, the two get reacquainted. As in any good romance novel, their talking turns to flirting, which turns to kissing, which leads to tense conversations about how to merge their very different lives, which ends in—well, you know the rest. ​When you buy a book using a link on this page, we receive a commission.

34f988f1e970,The Romantic,,"When Diane Keaton was a girl in Santa Ana, she began to collect photographs of Cary Grant, placing them in a cherished scrapbook. She had just seen The Philadelphia Story , starring Grant and Katharine Hepburn, for the first time. Grant was dazzlingly handsome, of course, but something else about him had leapt off the screen and captured her imagination. Where Hepburn was gorgeous in a high-society way—all those gowns accentuating her trim waist, the dramatic shoulder-padded jackets, her fabulous mid-Atlantic accent—Keaton couldn’t take her eyes off Grant, who seemed to be having a better time than anyone else. “He wore things like white cardigan sweaters thrown ever so casually over his shoulders after a game of tennis, or a tuxedo with a white bow tie for afternoon tea, just for the fun of it,” Keaton recalled in one of her memoirs, Let’s Just Say It Wasn’t Pretty . “He wasn’t afraid of a polka-dot tie or handkerchief. He wore gray worsted wool suits with wide lapels, a waist button, a white shirt, and his collar up.” As she collated images of Grant, she also carefully recorded his fashion tips—the importance of a taut knot when tying a tie, the maxim that “Clothes make the man,” and so on. To Keaton, Grant represented a formative encounter with the elusive quality that she would spend the rest of her life chasing: beauty. Keaton, who died yesterday at age 79, was drawn to the stage, and then the screen, in an industry that remains obsessed with a shallower definition of beautiful . But from a young age, Keaton seemed to understand that actual beauty, the timeless kind, required a degree of depth, even darkness. It demanded originality and unconventionality, as well as fierce independence. These were the qualities that captivated her most. And they are the ones that describe her best. Read: Diane Keaton’s very different kind of memoir Keaton was born in Los Angeles in 1946 as Diane Hall, and she grew up in a one-story tract house in a neighborhood that was eventually partly razed for the construction of Interstate 5. Her childhood was happy, filled with Barbie dolls, little notes from her mother with advice like “Find a reason to love yourself every day,” and social gatherings with laughing neighbors. She remembered her parents inviting everyone over to watch the swallows return to Capistrano, and the couple across the street who doted on her, piling bright red cherries into a tall glass of 7Up, a drink she loved so much she swore she’d someday drink it in heaven. Insecurities dogged Keaton throughout her life. She worried about the shape of her eyes, the shape of her body, and about being pretty but plain. She wanted to look like Doris Day, but the only person people told her she had a striking resemblance to was Amelia Earhart—perhaps on account of her adventurous spirit. She was, as she put it, “a wild child on the cliffs of Laguna Beach, a pioneer rolling down the sand-duned banks of Death Valley.” But Keaton always saw herself as “an ordinary girl who became an ordinary woman.” The only extraordinary thing about her, she once said, was the strong will she inherited from her mother. On screen, Keaton’s characters tend to betray vulnerability: It comes through in the crinkle of a worried brow, the gee-whiz uneasiness, the absent-minded twirling of hair. The audience might wonder how much of this was performance, and how much of it was just her. Consider Keaton as Erica Barry in Something’s Gotta Give , fumbling apologetically through her first kiss with Jack Nicholson as Harry; as Carol Lipton in Manhattan Murder Mystery , charmingly oblivious to Alan Alda’s character’s advances; as Nina Banks trying to discreetly wave over her reluctant husband, played by Steve Martin, to meet their future son-in-law in Father of the Bride ; as Annie Hall wallowing in self-deprecation when she first meets Alvy Singer (“Oh God, Annie. Well, oh well. La di da, la di da, la la”); as Kay Corleone staring at her husband as the door closes in the last shot of The Godfather . All of it was acting, but all of it was unmistakably Keaton too. In her memoir Then Again , Keaton tells the story of that kiss with Nicholson, and how she lost track of whether she was herself or the character she was playing. “I forgot I was in a movie,” she wrote. She kept forgetting her lines. “The only thing I remembered was not to forget to kiss Jack.” Diane Keaton photographed in her Manhattan apartment, in April 1977 (Jill Krementz) Growing up, “there was always something interfering with getting things right,” Keaton recalled in Let’s Just Say It Wasn’t Pretty. “A question (the wrong kind), a hesitancy, and always, always the mangling of my sentences, the stammers, the ums, the you-knows, the oh-wells, the I-don’t-knows. I was inept, inexact, imprecise.” That these same mannerisms would end up helping her professionally always surprised her. (She dedicated that book to “all the women who can’t get to right without being wrong.”) Even when she achieved superstardom, she downplayed her talent, if unconvincingly, calling it second nature for her to play “birdbrains and spoiled brats.” Although she was a gifted actor, Keaton also cast a photographer’s eye on everything she encountered. In the 1970s, she converted a bedroom in her Upper East Side apartment into a darkroom. (This was the same apartment where she adorned one wall with a series of self-portraits she’d taken in a subway photo booth.) More recently, she told The New York Times that she was on a quest to find and purchase every book of photography ever published. “I know, I know—ridiculous. But so what?” she said. She described wanting to buy an old warehouse and turn it into a massive library of “image-driven books.” When remembering her father, the question that preoccupied her most was whether, when she gazed out at the ocean, she was seeing it the way that he once did. She once described talking to him after his death: “Dad, can I ask you something from the other side of the great mystery? How much of what you saw is what I see? It might sound crazy, but sometimes I believe I’m seeing things from inside your eyes.” Keaton was, in other words, a romantic above all. She fell in love easily with the world around her, and with men. She remembered vividly what it felt like the first time she laid eyes on Al Pacino, at a bar in New York, before they both auditioned for the parts they would get in The Godfather : “His face, his nose, and what about those eyes? I kept trying to figure out what I could do to make them mine. They never were. That was the lure of Al. He was never mine. For the next twenty years I kept losing a man I never had.” Keaton and Pacino had an on-again-off-again romance for years. After a failed attempt to get him to marry her—which involved her giving him an ultimatum in Rome while they filmed The Godfather III —she vowed never to marry anyone, and she didn’t, although she adopted two children and raised them on her own. And while she envied those who married and stayed together their whole lives, she wrote that, for her, “my love of the impossible far overshadowed the rewards of longevity.” Diane Keaton, in her Manhattan apartment in 1977, sits beneath a series of self-portraits she took in a subway photo booth. (Jill Krementz) Keaton also famously dated Woody Allen and Warren Beatty. And she had a forever crush on Jack Nicholson, whom she met in her 30s. “I didn’t want to be his friend. I wanted him to kiss me. It didn’t happen,” she remembered. (Later, after they starred together in Something’s Gotta Give , they became close friends. She wrote him love letters anyway, one of which she quoted in one of her memoirs: “Looking at you for as long as I have has made it easy for me to come to the conclusion that your face is the best face I’ve ever seen.”) But there was never anyone like Pacino. (Decades after they’d broken up for the last time, she saw him in an appearance on CNN and got so distraught that she threw up, she wrote in a memoir.) “After Al, I began building a wall around my vulnerability. More hats. Long-sleeved everything. Coats in the summer. Boots with knee socks and wool suits with scarves at the beach.” When Keaton was in her 60s, trying to come to grips with some of the indignities of aging, she occasionally tried—and failed—to challenge herself not to wear a hat out in public for once. She knew her trademark style had become a security blanket. This was Keaton in a nutshell: ferociously herself, yet never fully comfortable in her own skin. “Most of us over sixty have come to the point where we recognize that our accomplishments are diddly-squat in the grand scheme of things,” she once wrote. But she’d still wake up in the morning, look in the mirror, and sigh. And she had to work to remind herself that life itself was a gift—or, in her words, “Be grateful for what you have, you big jerk.” Beauty was everywhere to Keaton, and she learned that you sometimes had to push yourself to see it, sometimes even when it was right in front of you. “If we’re lucky,” she wrote, “we have a long time to consider what beauty means.” Beauty, to her, was the sound of Woody Allen teasingly calling her a “half-wit.” It was the unexpected thrill of running into an old friend on the street. It was Grand Central Station, a monument to humanity, both because it was built in the first place and because it survived almost being torn down. Beauty was in the misspelled, handwritten notes from her children. It was See’s Candies peanut brittle, her favorite dessert. It was the birds she could hear chirping on the telephone wire outside of her window when she was feeling down. It was Abraham Lincoln’s long face, a portrait of which she hung on her wall among photographs of her favorite men—48 all together—in a floor-to-ceiling tribute. It was her own bare feet in the mulch of a redwood forest, running toward her son. It was, she wrote, paraphrasing the Vogue editor Diana Vreeland, a lifetime spent looking for something she’d never seen before. And it was in the things she couldn’t stop seeing, even if she tried: Pacino’s dark eyes, the sound of his voice reading Macbeth to her at midnight, the way he called her “Di,” and the memory of him describing to her the autumn light on the street in the Bronx where he grew up. She saved scraps of their romance—including eight pink slips from the Shangri-La Hotel in 1987, that say, “Call from Al”—until the very end. But most of all, it was the Pacific Ocean, the same ancient body of water that she and her father could stare at for hours, “the first wonder of the world” as she once put it. Sparkling and irresistible but also deep, dark, and, above all, beautiful.",https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/2025/10/diane-keaton-romantic-quest-beauty/684541,Culture,BBC,Adrienne LaFrance,https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/RIiaUNFx7v_yOjshPmeqGiH8CDs=/0x43:2000x1085/1200x625/media/img/mt/2025/10/2025_10_12_Diane_Keaton_16x9/original.jpg,2025-10-12T20:32:35+00:00,b8b93f8d79501606e908e77200b1b8a344e457d3
3ee0cf5c98be,Amy Poehler Understood the Assignment,,"Though 2025 has already seen retrospective documentaries , a prime-time special , and a Lorne Michaels biography marking the 50th anniversary of Saturday Night Live , the show itself actually premiered on October 11, 1975—and last night’s episode, in a neat coincidence, happened exactly 50 years later. Such a special occasion called for just the right host—an alumnus found on any list of greatest cast members, but one who’s also easily recognizable to the younger audiences that the show is always chasing. It would also help if they’re still really, really funny. Fortunately, Amy Poehler understood the assignment. While Poehler can snark with the best of them, she always radiates a palpable compassion. Much of her comedic persona comes from exploring and satirizing the ways that idealistic people react to a changing and sometimes unfair world—an idea she returned to in her opening monologue . After mentioning that she didn’t have anything to promote other than her interview podcast, Good Hang , she joked, “That’s right, I am a podcaster now, and if that’s not a recession indicator, I don’t know what is.” Later, she riffed on her fears that one day she’ll be replaced by an AI actress who’s funnier than her and more willing to do nudity. (“I am willing to do full frontal, but nobody’s asked me, okay?”) When she joined SNL in the early 2000s, Poehler came to represent an outspoken feminism that, for a while, seemed to be culturally ascendant. She was part of the first and only all-female “Weekend Update” duo, with Tina Fey, and often participated in sketches that pushed sexist stereotypes past the point of parody, such as “Annuale,” a bit about a birth-control pill that limited periods to one havoc-filled day. Later, on the sitcom Parks and Recreation , her signature character, Leslie Knope, possessed a deep well of empathy that sometimes let her down as she pursued a better world. Accordingly, one of last night’s best sketches found Poehler playing a middle-aged mom dealing with perimenopause by acting like a teenage emo fan. Although the jokes about a middle-aged woman getting her areolas pierced at Claire’s were funny, the sketch acknowledged the oft-ignored anxiety felt by mothers in the sandwich generation , and kindly suggested that it might be healthy for them to occasionally vent their feelings via angsty rock. But Poehler is shrewd enough to cut against her persona, and she came in hot during the cold open , portraying United States Attorney General Pam Bondi as the sort of fussy woman who really wants to speak to the manager. As she sneered, squinted, and wagged her finger, Poehler’s Bondi rudely responded to members of the Senate Judiciary Committee: “Before I don’t answer, I’d like to insult you personally.” In a welcome surprise, Fey cameoed as a glazed-over, machine-gun-toting Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem , and dismissed a senator’s question as something that “makes me laugh more than the end of Old Yeller .” SNL has never been above the crowd-pleasing nostalgia of returning cast members, but the punchy reunion of Fey and Poehler—and, later that night, their appearance alongside Seth Meyers on “Weekend Update”—recalled the show’s creative high point in the late ’00s and the pair’s skill at turning impersonations into actual characters. Read: SNL is reading the room SNL is in a transitional moment , as it has been in the past. Key players such as Heidi Gardner and Ego Nwodim made unexpected departures over the summer, and the new cast members are just getting started (though the former Please Don’t Destroy member Ben Marshall came off as an old pro, and the newbie Veronika Slowikowska has already gotten an impressive amount of screen time). Poehler’s performance last night was a reminder that the show has always managed to reboot itself after a major shake-up. But it was also a timely showcase of certain, resonant values that recur in Poehler’s work—a disdain for corruption , an understanding of humanity’s unavoidable foibles, and an eye toward the everyday indignities that women face. Or, as Poehler put it in her monologue: “I know it can feel like times are really tough right now, and in some ways, they always have been, and they always will be. So I’ll just say this: If there’s a place that feels like home that you can go back to and laugh with your friends, consider yourself lucky. And I do.” SNL tends to avoid this level of naked sincerity, but coming from someone like Poehler, it landed as wisdom from an old friend, a reminder of why she’s one of the best hangs in the business.",https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/2025/10/amy-poehler-snl-host-50th-anniversary/684540,Culture,BBC,Michael Tedder,https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/as_OOq_ObxVaQc-woCF25SFrraE=/0x43:2000x1085/1200x625/media/img/mt/2025/10/25_10_12_SNL/original.jpg,2025-10-12T17:08:27+00:00,26114d41a1f426f60b457bab8d7aa69b5bdbeb4e
2cb3834436d2,The MAGA-fication of Sports Continues,,"Some people steal valor. President Donald Trump steals machismo. Notice how he constantly positions himself alongside athletes, most especially mixed-martial-arts combatants and professional wrestlers. Like those purveyors of the “hammer fist” and the “rear naked choke,” Trump styles himself as an “Ultimate Fighter,” a crotch-kicker in chief who will stop at little to force his opponents to submit. Ten months into Trump’s second term, he’s made 10 appearances at major sporting events, such as the Super Bowl and the NCAA-wrestling championships, and he’s carried his brawling culture war into all of them. At the Daytona 500, he did a ceremonial lap in his armored limo; told the drivers, “This is your favorite president”; and declared that he loves fender-bumping stock-car racers because they have “guts.” Last month, he scolded the NFL for its new kickoff rule, which is calculated to limit concussions, complaining on his social-media site: “‘Sissy’ football is bad for America, and bad for the NFL!” And recently, Trump announced that on June 14, as part of the buildup to festivities celebrating America’s 250th anniversary of independence, he will host a blood-speckling Ultimate Fighting Championship cage fight on the White House grounds. There will reportedly be weigh-ins at the Lincoln Memorial and stalls with punching bags for tourists. More is going on here than bread and circuses , distractions to blot out tariff pain or the attempted prosecutions of political opponents. Trump’s pervasive presence in stadiums is rooted in his understanding of the basic power of sports-audience psychology: Fans feel the wins and losses of their favorite teams and athletes as personal successes and failures. Their allegiances come with an emotional sense of direct participation—even “smugness,” one study suggests—as anyone who has seen a municipal trophy parade can attest. Trump and his UFC partnership take this neurotic desire to identify with winners to snarling new heights, given the organization’s kill-or-die ethos. The only sport that Trump actually plays well is golf—and he cheats at it, according to a 2015 Washington Post investigation , various playing partners, and a viral video from last summer that showed a caddy surreptitiously dropping a ball in a playable lie for him. (Trump denies it: “I don’t need to,” he told the Post .) But the sport that has mattered most to Trump politically is MMA, the leg-chopping, carotid-artery-squeezing combat spectacle that combines jiu-jitsu, boxing, Muay Thai, wrestling, and grappling, and commands the attention of millions of young men, and which he used in the 2024 election to register and win their votes . His administration is full of people with direct connections to the UFC, the most popular of the MMA organizations. The White House communications director Steven Cheung at one point worked for the UFC. Education Secretary Linda McMahon and her estranged husband, Vince, were UFC business partners through their ownership of World Wrestling Entertainment, and she remains a shareholder. Trump’s FBI director, Kash Patel, has said that he wants to partner with the UFC to develop training programs for federal agents. Trump’s taste for combat sports dates to the 1980s, after his reported failed bid to buy the Baltimore Colts. In 1988, he turned to boxing promotion to support his Atlantic City casino venture, paying a then-record $11 million to host a Mike Tyson–Michael Spinks heavyweight bout, a terrible mismatch and an event I covered . Before the fight, Trump’s then-wife, Ivana, told me with satisfaction, “There is a smell of blood in the air.” Trump sent a flock of helicopters to bring in celebrities for the night, including Paul Simon, Warren Beatty, Billy Crystal, Rob Reiner, and Jack Nicholson, and corralled them at a VIP cocktail party that turned into a chaotic klieg-lit media crush with Trump forcing his way through the crowd to their table. Simon retreated behind a pair of sunglasses, and Nicholson snapped resentfully, “Shut off the damn lights!” The fight, an utter farce, lasted 91 seconds, but Trump formed a lasting relationship with the ferocious Tyson. That same year, Trump hosted his first WrestleMania event, eventually entering the WWE Hall of Fame . The UFC made boxing and pro wrestling seem like straw throwing. One of its initial marketing slogans was “ No Rules ,” and the contestants on the inaugural 1993 event card promised to fight until “knockout, submission, doctor’s intervention, or death.” The only tactics barred were eye gouging, groin strikes, and biting, none of which was especially policed. The first UFC champion, Royce Gracie, recalled that, indeed, “There were no rules. ‘Do I need boxing gloves?’ Nope. ‘Do I need shin pads?’ Nope. ‘Everything goes?’ Yep. ‘But what if I kick him in the nuts?’ It’s okay.” Republican Senator John McCain called it “human cockfighting” and tried to have it banned altogether , but Trump hosted events at his New Jersey casino when it was still illegal in many states. As the UFC president Dana White said of Trump in 2016 in a speech on his behalf at the Republican National Convention, “Donald was the first guy that recognized the potential that we saw in the UFC and encouraged us to build our business.” White added, “He got in the trenches with us.” By 2011, the UFC was such a booming enterprise that an estimated 30 million Americans considered themselves avid fans. Read: ‘Warrior culture’ offers a lot, but not everything It’s hard to overstate the visceral shock of this “sport” the first time you encounter it, no matter how its proponents try to philosophize it, or loan it form , or impose ethics upon it. Groin kicks have been barred, but it’s still perfectly legal to choke an opponent to the point of blackout, or to beat their face into sirloin while they’re already on the ground. In fact, the UFC’s rules , which were not unified until 2001, suggest just how much savagery has been practiced over its brief history: No kicking a floored opponent in the head; no “spiking” them to the ground on their head or neck; no fingers may be clawed into orifices or open wounds. Then there is this: No “timidity.” More and more, Trump has borrowed his political style from the UFC. As his wife, Melania Trump, said when campaigning for him in 2016, “As you may know by now, when you attack him, he will punch back 10 times harder.” In 2024, just two days after Trump’s criminal conviction for paying hush money, he chose to attend a UFC event in Newark, and the crowd serenaded him rhythmically with “Fuck Joe Biden, Fuck Joe Biden!” That guttural, braying sensibility seems to be seeping into every sports forum he visits. This year’s Ryder Cup golf galleries at the Bethpage Black course, already rowdy, were whipped up by an Air Force One flyover and Trump’s appearance on the first tee; they hurled constant obscenities at the Northern Irish golfer Rory McIlroy and a beer at his wife. An emcee led the crowd in a synchronized “Fuck you, Ror-eeee,” chants pulled straight from a UFC cage match. There is plenty of coarseness in American arenas totally unrelated to MAGA or Trumpism, of course. But the MAGA-fication of sports is a noticeable step up in brutishness, and it’s not just about influencing voters. It’s aimed at weakening our collective, across-the-board sense of boundaries, the mutual adherence to limits that sports are supposed to teach. President George H. W. Bush used the South Lawn to play horseshoes. Trump wants to stage a blood sport on the same ground. Cage fighters don’t just paralyze opponents with mistrust and anxiety as to what bare-fistedness they’re capable of next. They present opponents and audiences alike with a dilemma. Do you abandon your old practices and enter the fray on their terms? Or adhere to your own values, at peril of being mauled? How do you parry, without losing yourself, your honor, your conception of who you want to be in the contest? Trump understands better than perhaps any competitor in recent history how to turn a bout into a brawl, and he knows that no one cares to listen to the bloodied losers when they complain about broken rules. The UFC’s source of primal power is that it’s essentially a rule-breaking experience for the exultant audience, a vicarious chance to deliver a chin kick. Trump has recognized that and played hard to it, and to the American audience’s dread of the losing side, persuading them to accept ever more vicious deployments of force, if that’s what it takes to win.",https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/2025/10/white-house-ufc-mma/684538,Culture,BBC,Sally Jenkins,https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/VbOAx8XJ5VuGAcB6JnNvpRd-Clk=/0x43:2000x1085/1200x625/media/img/mt/2025/10/2025_10_10_magafication_mpg/original.jpg,2025-10-11T13:02:59+00:00,ae5d3dfc89d9373d6dead28d270871d911fc6099
c2369267360d,The Movie That Doesn’t Belong in the Real World,,"No franchise in Disney’s deep corporate Rolodex is more odd and misshapen than Tron . The original 1982 film was for years a pop-culture bookend: The tale of a video-game developer who gets zapped into his own software, it was the first movie to significantly use CGI in its production. As visually groundbreaking as it was, Tron is also narratively puzzling—built on an internal logic of digital life that required lots of exposition. It was a box-office disappointment, seemingly destined to be a footnote in cinematic history. Somehow, two sequels have materialized to update the swooshing neon visuals and cartoony renditions of a virtual world. The latest attempt is Tron: Ares , which, as dazzling as it often is, features one of the more rock-brained screenplays I’ve ever encountered. It’s another superficial, techno-futuristic tale that emphasizes its glossy look over its heady concept. Each Tron movie (the other is 2010’s gorgeously convoluted Tron: Legacy ) shares this epic mismatch of enchanting imagery and muddled storytelling. Ares does make a heroic effort to refer back to the two prior films: 15 years after Legacy , sentient computer programs now run amok on metropolitan streets, unleashed from their digital compound. In some ways, Ares feels responsive to real-life headlines that are consumed with whatever staggering technological leap that machine intelligence might make next—though the movie doesn’t have much of a take on AI beyond “It would be nice if it were good, and not bad.” Still, at least there are a lot of oversize-glow-stick fights along the way. Compared with its predecessors, Ares can seem grounded. The first Tron focuses on Kevin Flynn (played by Jeff Bridges), who gets teleported inside his own arcade games; he meets his programs, who are anthropomorphized and wearing colorful armor (blue for good, red for bad). In Legacy , Flynn gets lost within a version of cyberspace called The Grid; his son logs on to chase after him. Ares is much more concerned with tangible matters. Flynn’s company is now in the hands of a new CEO, Eve Kim (Greta Lee), who has become obsessed with an invention of Flynn’s called the “permanence code.” The file, now missing, would somehow make it possible to turn lines of code into a concrete substance, be it a fruit tree, a life-saving medicine, or a flesh-and-blood personification of a program. Read: Our AI fears run long and deep Worried about the essential laws of physics ? Questioning how any computer can just beam some lasers onto the ground and 3-D-print an entire human being? Well, then you’re watching the wrong movie. This is a series that has always operated as absurd speculation, where broad metaphors about life and science get posited amid techno beats and car chases. Ares plays with the notion of software developing a sense of self—but it largely still treats AI’s potential as sci-fi nonsense, rather than as a topic that has prompted congressional debate . In the film, the worrisome program is called Ares (Jared Leto); it’s an advanced creation that Julian Dillinger (Evan Peters, appearing as the grandson of Tron ’s original villain) uses to wage war on Eve, his business rival. Julian dispatches Ares and his deputy, Athena (an imperious Jodie Turner-Smith), to the physical world, ordering them to shake down Eve for information about Flynn’s code. The pair have to work against the clock: After 29 minutes, their code degrades, and they return to the mainframe. (Again: Please dispense with any actual scientific thought on how this might work.) There’s a lot of flitting between the material and cyber realms, undercutting one of Tron ’s primary appeals: basking in the strangeness of what life looks like inside of a computer. Ares instead collapses the two, transporting technology from the other universe—like the light cycle, a futuristic motorcycle that’s become a franchise icon—onto real-world streets. These crossovers can be thrilling, but they also reinforce how much more visually inspired the world of code is than its earthly counterpart. As such, I felt a little shortchanged every time I had to see human beings arguing in a conference room instead. Still, I can’t deny that the film’s director, Joachim Rønning (a Disney mainstay who has made sequels to Pirates of the Caribbean and Maleficent ), does provide plenty of primary-colored glowing rings and vehicles to look at, and a thrumming, head-crunching score from Nine Inch Nails keeps the vibes relatively immaculate. Perhaps the film’s biggest issue, however, is its protagonist. Leto is a total charisma vacuum as Ares—forgivable when the character is portrayed as a brutal, unthinking machine, but less so when he starts to develop morality and self-awareness. As its titular figure, Ares should be the movie’s focus. Yet Leto never shakes the role’s robotic nature, even as his character strives to become more human, and his acting partners struggle to play off that in a meaningful way. The goofy charm that Bridges brings to the prior films is greatly lacking here, replaced with mordant self-seriousness. The audience is left with a wheel-spinning story about an anthropomorphized AI finding itself—and a slew of unanswered questions about the radical science on display.",https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/2025/10/tron-ares-movie-review/684531,Culture,BBC,David Sims,https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/HKqV50XZ5st2SZMBpvlKVMAIy48=/0x45:2100x1139/1200x625/media/img/mt/2025/10/2025_10_10_Tron_Ares_Review/original.jpg,2025-10-10T22:13:52+00:00,7018daf799fcb93683e51ad1e454233eff2ad5af
e82af4e02169,Buy This Album. Now Buy It in Green.,,"The news that Taylor Swift’s The Life of a Showgirl has recorded the biggest sales week for any album ever is an astonishing milestone in the annals of e-commerce. Swift’s fame ensured that the album would be a hit no matter what, but moving more than 3.5 million units in seven days required high-pressure sales techniques more common to mattress retailers than musicians. The feat testifies to one of the strangest aspects of modern music: the way that popularity has become part of the performance. To understand what Swift achieved, it’s helpful to understand how Adele set the record Swift just broke. When her album 25 sold 3.38 million copies in 2015, the music industry was a different place than it is today. Spotify had come to America just four years earlier, and it was only beginning to qualitatively and quantitatively erode the value of music. As streaming slowly became the public’s preferred way of listening to records, the medium complicated the traditional definition of success. An album having 100 plays could mean one person played it 100 times, or 100 people played it once. In either case, the artist is making a lot less money than they would from 100 album sales. In late 2014, the music industry started counting album equivalent units , a composite metric that accounts for streaming and sales. The term weights sales—physical and digital—far more heavily than it does streams. Understanding that their business model was under threat, pop music’s titans initially balked at streaming. Swift withheld her catalog from Spotify from 2014 to 2017; Adele released 25 without making it available to stream at all for months. Unlike a lot of young pop stars, Adele had a multigenerational audience that included people who were still in the habit of buying albums. She followed up an inescapable breakout album (2011’s 21 ) with a monumental single, “Hello,” that sent a typhoon of hype through social media. The strategy worked. She smashed a sales record that ’NSync had set in 2000—which, hauntingly, was the height of the CD-sales era, right before file sharing brought the industry to a low. As streaming then supplanted sales and stars such as Swift hammered out their issues with Spotify, a new playbook was written. Streaming encourages a volume game—the more songs on an album, the more streams it’s likely to notch. Streaming also makes repeat listening more important. Pop was always premised on replay value—but no matter how many times someone spun their CD of Bedtime Stories , Madonna received money only from the initial sale. In monetizing each listen, Spotify gave artists distinct incentives to cultivate fervent fan loyalty. The streaming era coincides with the rise of “stans” for good reason. Listeners can now contribute to their favorite artist’s success by hitting “Play” and never “Pause.” The Billboard charts have accordingly leapt from being an insider-y topic to a subject of mainstream conversation akin to player stats in professional sports. K-pop fandoms circulate guides on how Billboard counts streams. When Cardi B and Nicki Minaj were recently feuding, they and their supporters waged war in part by comparing sales totals. Ed Sheeran has talked openly about thinking of his career in arithmetic terms. To be a fan of pop music already required appreciating a market-minded approach to art, but now it also means participating —simply by listening. Read: How did Taylor Swift convince the world that she’s relatable? Swift is the prime predator in this ecosystem. On the same day in 2024 that she released her 16-track album The Tortured Poets Department , she also released a 15-track bonus anthology. The payload of content was embraced by a sprawling fan base that was supercharged with excitement from the Eras Tour (the highest-grossing tour ever), and the album handily broke the record for the most streams in a debut week. But because its consumption skewed so heavily toward on-demand digital listening, it couldn’t beat Adele’s total-units sales record. For The Life of a Showgirl , Swift and her team have taken advantage of an unexpected by-product of streaming: the elevated importance of traditional album sales. Vinyl has boomed in the past decade not because people necessarily want to listen to that format but because it gives listeners a tangible way to display their appreciation. Cassette and CD sales have bounced back a bit for similar reasons. Relatedly, music merchandise—tees and totes—has become a hot status symbol. Showgirl turns an album release into something closer to the McDonald’s Monopoly contest, encouraging repeat purchases. The album exists in more than 30 “variants” so far: different combinations of listening formats, album art, merch, and bonus music. At Target—only at Target—you can buy The Life of a Showgirl: The Crowd Is Your King Edition (Summertime Spritz Pink Shimmer Vinyl) , for $34.99. Online, you can order the So Glamorous Cabaret Edition CD featuring a show tunes-y take on the song “Elizabeth Taylor.” Different versions have different hand-signed photos; one edition comes with a cardigan; another has voice notes and a cover that tints the turquoise bathwater of the regular album image into a brownish orange. Variants aren’t a new idea, but the sheer volume in this case appears to be unprecedented, and Swift has marketed them in a brazenly manipulative fashion. In the nearly two months between when the album was announced and when it was released, her website featured a number of mysterious countdown clocks. Invariably, they counted down to the announcement of an album variant—many of which were then available for a limited time only. Countdown clocks and flash sales are common features of online retailers that try to panic consumers into buying things they don’t need, and here Swift was acting in the spirit of Temu . Listeners can, of course, resist these offers. But for many of Swift’s fans, ponying up must feel simultaneously pleasurable and obligatory—just like paying to attend Life of a Showgirl movie screenings that mostly consisted of lyric videos. On social media, some Swifties have been sharing photos of their hauls . It’s not yet clear how many variant editions have been sold, but if even a small percentage of Swift’s enormous fan base picked up more than one copy, she would have added a significant multiplier to her sales total. What does this new record signify? Swift may well be more important today than Adele was a decade ago—but the comparison is apples to oranges because the cultural mainstream has fractured so dramatically since then. Swift is unlike her pop predecessors in the shape of her success : Rather than conquer the world with easy listening for a broad audience of casual listeners, she has inspired an intense, tribal devotion. The release of Showgirl —like those of Swift’s previous four original albums—was preceded by no singles, and you can stream the album for free. The people who are buying it are, plainly, making an investment based on extramusical reasons. Which is not to say the music doesn’t matter; now that the album is out, it’s also breaking streaming records in ways that testify to her talent for making addictive pop. Showgirl is far less dazzling than advertised , but it remains a tight, 12-track album infused with the bubblegum witchcraft of the producers Max Martin and Shellback. A week after I reviewed it, I still feel that it’s her weakest effort to date—she’s previously rendered many of its ideas more cleverly, profoundly, ambitiously. Listening invites far too many thoughts about commerce winning over art. Swift herself certainly seems to be thinking about money more than ever. Perhaps reflecting a cultural vibe shift back toward “ greed is good ,” Showgirl sees America’s favorite girl next-door flaunt her wealth lyrically, really for the first time. She mentions Gucci clothes, Cartier diamonds, and Parisian hotel stays. At first, “Wi$h Li$t” reads as an anti-materialist love song: Swift doesn’t crave “Balenci shades”; she just wants kids, love, and peace. But the joke implied by its title punctuation is that every dollar she earns is underwriting her own personal quest for happiness. This is Showgirl ’s boldest achievement: disguising new bragging rights for a billionaire as a fairy-tale ending, and giving her fans a noble reason to spend.",https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/2025/10/taylor-swift-the-life-of-a-showgirl-sales-records-adele/684522,Culture,BBC,Spencer Kornhaber,https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/NB2tJgxgTmLsEWK0ZKp_Cqp9mHU=/0x116:5455x2957/1200x625/media/img/mt/2025/10/promo_c/original.jpg,2025-10-10T19:17:58+00:00,e2b6516e4793a1ff93ba1d512b1e2b5ddbe04a9c
957f9e8a7ccd,"Wake Up, Rip Van Winkle",,"W ashington Irving was born just as the news reached New York City: The war with England was over. To celebrate, his mother named him after the victorious American general. When he was a boy of 6, Irving was out for a walk with a Scottish maidservant, who spotted George Washington, now the nation’s first president, on a Manhattan street. The enterprising maidservant followed him into a shop. (Apparently, presidents once ran their own errands.) “Please, Your Honor,” she said. “Here’s a bairn was named after you.” Putting his hand on the young man’s head, Washington bestowed his blessing. Explore the November 2025 Issue Check out more from this issue and find your next story to read. View More Thus anointed, Irving went on to become America’s original literary celebrity. During the first half of the 19th century, Charles Dudley Warner wrote in The Atlantic in 1880 , “probably no citizen of the republic, except the Father of his Country, had so wide a reputation as his namesake, Washington Irving.” Irving wrote one of the first, and still one of the best, American ghost stories: “ The Legend of Sleepy Hollow ,” about a Hessian soldier who lost his head to a Patriot cannonball. He wrote satirical sketches, romantic tales, travelogues, and, near the end of his life, a five-volume biography of George Washington. Yet the story that established Irving’s literary reputation is, at first glance, not a likely one to build a new national literature around. Irving wrote it during a sojourn in Britain. He took its bones from a German folktale. And although set in the Revolutionary era, the story doesn’t dramatize America’s fight for independence. Rather, the protagonist dozes right through it. “Rip Van Winkle” is one of those stories that is at once familiar and obscure. Its contours remain well known: Man takes long nap, grows very long beard, returns to changed world. Its hero has become shorthand, to the point of cliché, to describe any long slumber. Yet Irving’s short story is not as widely anthologized or read as it once was. Its complexities and peculiarities are only dimly recalled, if at all, by many readers. That is a shame, because unlike a lot of antique American writing, “Rip Van Winkle” has retained much of its original appeal. Mark Twain famously accused Irving’s contemporary James Fenimore Cooper of committing 114 of a possible 115 literary offenses on a single page of The Deerslayer . That may not have been entirely fair to Cooper, but his violations of Twain’s rules (“Employ a simple and straightforward style”; “Use the right word, not its second cousin”) can make reading the Leatherstocking Tales an arduous walk in the wilderness. Irving’s stories, like Twain’s, are as funny now as the day they were written. Washington Irving, the first American author to win international acclaim (Universal Images Group Editorial / Getty) “Rip Van Winkle” isn’t merely comic, however. More than just an account of a very long nap, it is a story about the role of memory in the young republic; it’s about how to create something new while retaining a connection to what came before. America’s first folktale, in other words, is a folktale about the making of America. “R ip Van Winkle ” appeared in The Sketch Book of Geoffrey Crayon, Gent. , a collection of stories and essays published serially beginning in 1819. The title character is “a simple, good-natured fellow” who lives in a village at the foot of New York’s Catskill Mountains. Ostensibly a farmer, he abhors the drudgery of tending his land, which has dwindled under his management to little more than a sorry patch of potatoes and Indian corn. Rip, we’re told, is “one of those happy mortals, of foolish, well-oiled dispositions, who take the world easy, eat white bread or brown, whichever can be got with least thought or trouble, and would rather starve on a penny than work for a pound.” Rip is a beloved figure in his village, quick to help a neighbor build a fence or teach a child to fly a kite. His laziness seems to set in only when he is called to attend to his own affairs, and it is only in his own home that he finds an adversary—his wife, Dame Van Winkle, who deplores his loafing. Years of marriage have done nothing to diminish her disdain. On the contrary, Irving writes, “a tart temper never mellows with age, and a sharp tongue is the only edged tool that grows keener with constant use.” It is to escape Dame Van Winkle’s “petticoat government” that Rip, together with his equally put-upon dog, Wolf, repairs to the woods to do some squirrel hunting. Here, a bit of magic enters the story. Venturing into the wild, Rip encounters a strange group of men, done up in traditional Dutch dress and playing ninepins—bowling—in a mountain hollow. These, we later learn, are the ghosts of Hendrick Hudson’s crew, the first Europeans to explore the Hudson River, aboard the Half Moon. After helping one of the Dutchmen lug a keg of liquor to the game, Rip drinks several flagons, passes out, and wakes up two decades later. He returns to his village, fearing the wrath of Dame Van Winkle, only to find most of the people he knew, his wife among them, dead or gone. Writing at a time when there was little American literature to speak of, Irving borrowed liberally from European sources. The nap, the beard, and even the mysterious bowlers are lifted directly from “Peter Klaus,” a German folktale about a goatherd. In terms of style, the story is something of a mock-epic, a form that would have been familiar to readers of the time. The Irving biographer Andrew Burstein has described Rip as “a lazy Odysseus,” and the story can be read as a series of clever inversions of Homer’s poem. Whereas the Greek hero knew to avoid the Lotus-Eaters’ soporific drug, Rip drinks deeply of the enchanted Dutch liquor. Rather than returning to a patient Penelope, Rip has fled the termagant Dame Van Winkle. Arriving back in Ithaca after a 20-year absence, Odysseus is recognized by his loyal dog, Argos. Rip, gone for the same duration, is greeted with a snarl by a dog he takes for Wolf. No less an authority than James Joyce noted the similarities, weaving allusions to “Rip Van Winkle” into the story of his own wayward Ulysses, Leopold Bloom. Yet “Rip Van Winkle” isn’t just a pastiche of Old World mythologies. By sending Rip off to sleep precisely at the moment America declares its independence, Irving underlines how radically life would be altered by the ensuing Revolution. The village Rip returns to is strange to him: “The very character of the people seemed changed. There was a busy, bustling, disputatious tone about it, instead of the accustomed phlegm and drowsy tranquillity.” So abrupt was the shift that the portrait of King George III that had hung above the village inn seems not to have been replaced but rather hastily updated: “The red coat was changed for one of blue and buff, a sword was held in the hand instead of a sceptre, the head was decorated with a cocked hat, and underneath was painted in large characters, GENERAL WASHINGTON. ” Irving was writing before the Americanized spelling of words like scepter , pioneered by Noah Webster, had fully taken hold, a reminder that the transformations the story describes were still very much ongoing. Rip wakes from his torpor not just on any day, but on an election day, which allows Irving to magnify his hero’s disorientation. The men with whom he used to gossip at the inn are nowhere to be found. “In place of these, a lean, bilious-looking fellow, with his pockets full of handbills, was haranguing vehemently about rights of citizens—elections—members of congress—liberty—Bunker’s Hill—heroes of seventy-six—and other words, which were a perfect Babylonish jargon to the bewildered Van Winkle.” When the townspeople encounter Rip, wizened and unrecognizable, they buffet him with questions he can’t comprehend: For which side did he vote? Is he “Federal or Democrat?” Rip tries to quiet them by pledging his allegiance to King George—only to be denounced as a Tory. Irving was clearly fascinated—and perhaps not a little frightened—by the question of what it means for a nation to spring into existence. What could unite this bustling, disputatious new country? It was founded on noble ideas (rights of citizens, representative government), and the Revolution had produced its own mythology (Bunker’s Hill, heroes of seventy-six). But could ideas hold a country together? In the early decades of American history, these were open questions. They still are. As a storyteller, Irving was particularly concerned with how America would fare without a common culture. He worried, the scholar Howard Horwitz has written, “that the legendary transmission of tales and thus of cultural memory was fragile in the new republic.” In “The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,” also published in The Sketch Book , Irving wryly explains that the village of the title was rife with ghost stories because it was an old Dutch village; elsewhere in the country, such stories were uncommon: “There is no encouragement for ghosts in most of our villages, for they have scarcely had time to finish their first nap and turn themselves in their graves, before their surviving friends have travelled away from the neighborhood; so that when they turn out at night to walk their rounds, they have no acquaintance left to call upon.” Americans were too rootless and restless, too eager to seek their fortune—they didn’t stay in one place long enough to be haunted by ghosts. “Rip Van Winkle” is a story about the young nation making room for a figure from the past. In an unpublished fragment written while Irving was serving as minister to Spain under President John Tyler—this was a time when literary achievement could lead to a choice diplomatic appointment—­ he described what he was up to: “When I first wrote the Legend of Rip van Winkle my thought had been for some time turned towards giving a colour of romance and tradition to interesting points of our national scenery which is so deficient generally in our country.” The American painter Albertis del Orient Browere’s 1833 depiction of the moment Rip returns home after his 20-year nap (Courtesy of the Met) While the events of the story’s first half (the nap, the return) remain familiar, the less famous denouement is crucial to understanding Irving’s purpose. The village is initially skeptical of Rip, but eventually his identity is established and his fantastical account confirmed. Peter Vanderdonk, “the most ancient inhabitant of the village, and well versed in all the wonderful events and traditions of the neighbourhood,” explains that it is widely known that Hendrick Hudson returns at regular intervals to the Catskills “to revisit the scenes of his enterprise, and keep a guardian eye upon the river”—and to bowl a few frames. His strange story thus corroborated, Rip is welcomed back to the village. He seems more relieved to be free of his wife’s tyranny than that of the English—to have “got his neck out of the yoke of matrimony.” (Irving’s portrait of Dame Van Winkle, who is never granted so much as a first name, has made the story a ready target for feminist critique.) Irving was an inventive stylist, with tricks up his ruffled sleeve. The tale of Rip Van Winkle is nested within various layers of storytelling, to a degree that can be confounding even for contemporary readers accustomed to such authorial gamesmanship. The Sketch Book was published under the name Geoffrey Crayon, one of Irving’s literary alter egos. “Rip Van Winkle,” though, opens with a prefatory note explaining that this story was discovered among the papers of the late historian Diedrich Knickerbocker— another of Irving’s alter egos . In a note appended to the story, Knickerbocker reveals that he has talked to Rip himself and is certain his account is true. Knickerbocker allows, however, that it took some time for Rip to arrive at the version we’ve just read. “He was observed, at first, to vary on some points every time he told it, which was, doubtless, owing to his having so recently awaked. It at last settled down precisely to the tale I have related, and not a man, woman, or child in the neighbourhood but knew it by heart.” That didn’t mean they all believed it. “Some always pretended to doubt the reality of it, and insisted that Rip had been out of his head,” Knickerbocker writes, before assuring the reader that the old Dutch inhabitants of the village “almost universally gave it full credit.” Almost universally—lurking over Knickerbocker’s shoulder, Irving raises an eyebrow: This historian is credulous, and not entirely reliable. What is the purpose of this layering and undermining of the story’s authenticity? In the end, what matters isn’t whether the story is true, but rather that everyone in the village knew it by heart. Rip returns to his favorite old haunt, the inn, where he tells his story to all who will listen: “He took his place once more on the bench at the inn-door, and was reverenced as one of the patriarchs of the village, and a chronicle of the old times ‘before the war.’ ” He’s become a link to the past, a living connection to the history that predates the Revolution. The remarkable achievement of Irving’s fiction is that it solved the very problem it identified: “Rip Van Winkle” itself became a story that the nation knew by heart. It propelled The Sketch Book to blockbuster sales and Irving to international acclaim, a first for an American author. The story was widely anthologized, including in McGuffey Readers , making it a staple of American childhood. It was also adapted into a popular stage play, with the same actor, Joseph Jefferson , in the title role for an astonishing four-decade run . The production, which toured the country, made its debut just after the Civil War, when its pastoral setting and evocation of the Founding may have soothed audiences still scarred by sectional conflict. What was it about Rip? As the critic Donald R. Anderson has written, he embodies few traditional American values: “He has an aversion to hard work; he is an apparently inadequate family man; he is, from what we are told, without those Leatherstocking virtues of courage and inventiveness; he is lacking in Yankee shrewdness; he is not a ‘winner.’ ” Perhaps this is what made him so beloved. Irving may have intuited, at the dawn of American history, that the nation would need a foil for flintier heroes like Cooper’s Natty Bumppo, self-improvers like the Benjamin Franklin of the Autobiography , and secular saints such as Parson Weems’s George Washington. Herman Melville, one of Rip’s admirers, called him a “good-natured good-for-nothing.” That’s an American archetype, too. He presides over Hart Crane’s modernist masterpiece The Bridge , published in 1930, at another moment when the nation’s past and present seemed to be sundering: “And Rip forgot the office hours, / and he forgot the pay; / Van Winkle sweeps a tenement / way down on Avenue A.” In his influential study Love and Death in the American Novel , Leslie Fiedler saw Rip’s “old scapegrace charm” in Jiggs, the hero of the long-running comic strip Bringing Up Father , and in Dagwood Bumstead, of Blondie . This past spring, when the actor George Wendt died, it occurred to me that Norm Peterson of Cheers was a descendant of Rip, too: the man at the corner stool, adored by all but his long-suffering wife, avoiding the responsibilities of work and home in favor of one more flagon. The Cheers finale, which aired in 1993, was watched by an estimated 93 million Americans . It’s impossible to imagine a television series, let alone a short story, uniting that share of the country today. Irving’s animating concern in “Rip Van Winkle” is also a problem for the present: Can a nation with no common stories, and a fleeting sense of its own history, hope to hang together?

73aa7b155e48,The Many Lives of Eliza Schuyler,,"M onticello was Thomas Jefferson’s home in retirement, after decades of public service, including as the nation’s third president. It was also, on any given day, crowded with women and young people—Jefferson’s daughters by his wife, Martha; their 12 surviving children (six of them girls); his sister. Female visitors, including First Lady Dolley Madison, often popped by. Among the plantation’s large enslaved workforce, women and children outnumbered men by roughly two to one. Some of those enslaved children were Jefferson’s own, by Sally Hemings, who was also the half sister of his dead wife. Throughout the Age of Revolution, families made Monticello run.

View More And so the site , where I serve as president, debuted a tour called “Women at Monticello” in 2024. Our guides prepared with customary rigor, reading widely in the ever-growing scholarship on women in the early republic. They devised a premise as sound as it was simple: The extraordinary stories of ordinary women, free and enslaved, would take center stage. And areas where women mostly spent their time, which guests are moved through quickly on regular tours, would claim pride of place. Reviews were glowing. “I have been coming to Monticello for fifty years. This was in the top three best experiences ever,” one visitor wrote. Yet only a third of the tickets sold. At year-end, we made the difficult decision to concentrate the tour in the ghetto that is March: Women’s History Month. The fate of “Women at Monticello” hinged, in large part, on men. We built it; they didn’t come. Barely one in five people who took the tour was male, though roughly 40 percent of our visitors are, which illustrates a long-standing problem: The general public doesn’t much care about women’s history. In the world of nonfiction best sellers—those wide-spined histories and biographies sold at airports—the wielding of public power remains the big story. The kitchen, the marriage bed, and the cradle are sideshows at best, and women’s thoughts rarely make it onto the page. Once upon a time, Abigail Adams hoped that America’s Revolution might shift perspectives and priorities. “In the new Code of Laws which I suppose it will be necessary for you to make I desire you would Remember the Ladies,” she famously urged her husband in March 1776. “I cannot but laugh,” John Adams replied . In the quarter millennium since, scholars and activists have in different ways done their damnedest to wipe the smirk off his face. From the Revolution to the suffrage movement to the campaign for an Equal Rights Amendment and beyond, advocates have worked to wedge women’s lives into the laws of the land. For decades, academic historians have painstakingly documented those efforts and their mingled successes and shortcomings. Field-altering books have deepened scholars’ understanding of the domestic turmoil of Revolutionary America, among other moments. Yet there has been no women’s-history equivalent of Ron Chernow’s Alexander Hamilton (2004), which has sold more than 2 million copies, much less of David McCullough’s John Adams (2001), reprinted 19 times during its first three months, reaching 1 million copies well before the acclaimed HBO miniseries. In 2006, Publishers Weekly wondered whether a “Distaff David McCullough,” as a headline put it, might appear on the horizon. First ladies and other women close to male power seemed likeliest to break through. Yet PW ’s candidate, A Perfect Union: Dolley Madison and the Creation of the American Nation , by the historian Catherine Allgor, fell short of high sales expectations. Women read novels, men read about influential men, and the world goes round. Now, nearly two decades later, Amanda Vaill’s Pride and Pleasure: The Schuyler Sisters in an Age of Revolution has a chance to inspire some welcome crossover. Vaill has an impressive track record as a biographer (character!) and a screenwriter (plot!). She need not plead, “Remember the ladies”; her trio of luminous sisters is lodged in public memory already. Thanks to Lin-Manuel Miranda’s Hamilton , Eliza Schuyler (the middle sister who married the musical’s eponymous hero), fiery Angelica Schuyler Church (the eldest), and clear-eyed Peggy Schuyler Van Rensselaer (the youngest) come with their own playlist. America’s 250th anniversary makes securing their position on the country’s patriotic bookshelf an especially worthy challenge. But for Vaill to take her place as the “Distaff David McCullough” demands more than familiar protagonists and narrative brilliance. The core premise of women’s history has long been that when we reorient the inquiry, we not only introduce new characters but change the story itself, upending ideas about what lies at the margins and what at the center. One mustn’t, as the saying goes, simply add women and stir. Half the human race aren’t mere chips in the batter; their inclusion calls for a whole new cake. The colonial struggle against the British Crown began in the household, over taxes on home goods. One of the earliest artifacts of what would become the independence movement is a teapot , produced in London circa 1766, emblazoned with the motto No Stamp Act. Tea was consumed chiefly in private; Mother poured out. Newspapers were filled with columns urging women to boycott imported items. “Love your country much better than fine things,” exhorted an “Address to the Ladies ” in The Boston Post-Boy . Many women did so, forswearing British wares, spinning flax on town greens, and swapping handwritten patriotic verse while drinking herbal-tea substitutes. Up and down the Eastern Seaboard, women spoke the language of American liberty. The poet Phillis Wheatley, whose literary renown had helped secure her freedom from slavery, addressed George Washington, praising America’s struggle on the battlefield as “freedom’s cause,” which any reader would have recognized as her own. “And be it known unto Britain, even American daughters are Politicians & Patriots,” Boston’s Hannah Winthrop told her friend Mercy Otis Warren, who would become, in 1805, the author of one of the first comprehensive accounts of American independence. In a preface to her three-volume History of the Rise, Progress and Termination of the American Revolution , Warren said she had written it because “every manly arm was occupied,” a convenient fiction. Abigail Adams was hardly alone in raising what soon came to be called “the woman question.” Her husband’s laughter was the nervous sort. “We have been told that our Struggle has loosened the bands of Government every where,” he explained: “Children and Apprentices were disobedient—that schools and Colledges were grown turbulent—that Indians slighted their Guardians and Negroes grew insolent to their Masters.” But women, he continued, were a “Tribe more numerous and powerfull than all the rest.” He feared “the Despotism of the Petticoat.” Thomas Jefferson was likewise discomfited by the revolutionary possibility of female citizenship. He understood Warren as a political ally, and helped fund the publication of her trilogy, which he placed on a list of recommended titles by authors including Herodotus, Voltaire, and Benjamin Franklin. Yet he counseled Angelica Schuyler Church, with whom he had grown quite chummy in Paris, that the “tender breasts of ladies were not formed for political convulsion.” Angelica had been reading up on the struggles of the Federalists, especially her brother-in-law Alexander Hamilton’s, to ratify their blueprint for the nation. The “question on the new Constitution,” so consuming for men, “need not agitate you,” Jefferson wrote. She mustn’t imitate Parisian salonistes : “French ladies miscalculate much their own happiness when they wander from the true field of their influence into that of politicks.” At home as in society at large, the Revolution really did threaten to turn the world upside down. Still, what John Adams called “our Masculine systems” mostly held fast. The American Revolution clearly meant something to North American women. Some of them waged it, encamping with the armies, cooking, cleaning, and nursing, and, in a few exceptional cases, grabbing muskets themselves. Many reckoned with its ideals; pervasive talk of liberty held particular portent for women’s lives. And virtually all women east of the Appalachians experienced the violence, sickness, and scarcity of a civil war in which front lines and home fronts were never far apart. But what did women mean to the American Revolution? Modern scholarship on its formative role in women’s lives, and vice versa, took an important turn in 1980, when two young historians published landmark books on the subject—second books, because each had been told that a dissertation on a topic quite so pots-and-pans wouldn’t do. Mary Beth Norton offered a social historian’s answer in Liberty’s Daughters: The Revolutionary Experience of American Women, 1750–1800 . She focused on “the constant patterns of women’s lives”—bleeding, marrying, birthing, tending—and the ways the Revolutionary War altered them. The shifts she analyzed were more personal than political: subtle changes in duties, in self-conception, and occasionally in willingness to advocate. Judith Sargent Murray, who in 1790 published the pseudonymous essay “ On the Equality of the Sexes ,” offered one case in point. In 1798, Murray “confidently predicted the dawn of ‘a new era of female history.’ ” Norton’s own assessment of the Revolution’s “ambiguous” legacy for women was far more sober. John Trumbull’s portrait of Angelica Schuyler Church, her son Philip, and a servant, circa 1785 (The Picture Art Collection / Alamy) In Women of the Republic: Intellect and Ideology in Revolutionary America , Linda K. Kerber addressed the ideas that remade the political family. Instead of a royal patriarch ruling over voiceless subjects, America would be a fraternity of virtuous (male) citizens, created equal in their potential for self-government. Even those who thought women shouldn’t meddle in government acknowledged that they “could—and should—play a political role through the raising of a patriotic child,” and needed education to do so. The figure Kerber called the “Republican Mother” forged the polity at one step’s remove, “a citizen but not really a constituent.” Kerber underlined the “inherent paradox” of republican motherhood: It thickened the boundary between male and female realms. Yet her book is sunnier than Norton’s, more confident that the Revolution set American women on a road toward equality, however steep and circuitous. Two years after Norton and Kerber launched their revolutionary books, the Equal Rights Amendment went down in defeat. In the ensuing decades, feminism stalled, regrouped, and fizzled again. One major party put forth its first female candidates for president, both of whom lost, consequentially. Women’s rights rolled back, and a new pronatalism—republican motherhood for the 21st century—marched forward. All the while, historians remembered the ladies, broadening the cast of Revolutionary-era female figures to include enslaved and self-liberated Black women, Loyalist women, poor women, Native women, and “female husbands,” who rejected the gender binary altogether. Across their differences, shared status bound most women in the early republic. Their paths to property blocked by law and custom, and their literacy limited by education and expectation, their lives left fewer traces. In other words, they resisted the McCullough treatment. Washington, Adams, Hamilton, Jefferson, Franklin; rinse and repeat: A new life of one of the Revolution’s male heroes appears in bookstores most years around Father’s Day. In the 1990s, a time of crisis for the publishing industry, Founders’ biographies revived an old tradition. At least since 1800, when Parson Weems published his Life of Washington , biography has been the medium through which most Americans have understood the birth of their country. That is not a bad thing: The genre admits nuance, with every human life as patterned yet unique as a fingerprint. And it insists that everyone, past and present, lives in both epochal and personal time, making and made by history. So, too, Amanda Vaill’s Schuyler sisters. Staking a claim not just to the significance of her protagonists but also to her own stature as a portraitist in the grand manner, Vaill builds on some of the most compelling writing about women in early America, which has peered into the households of famous men, drawing on ample records to cast light in otherwise shadowy corners. Annette Gordon-Reed’s The Hemingses of Monticello (2008) made Sally Hemings, from whom not a word survives, a figure crucial to understanding the workings of power in the early American republic. Jill Lepore deftly explored the chiaroscuro nature of famous-man/hidden-woman histories in Book of Ages: The Life and Opinions of Jane Franklin (2013), her biography of Benjamin Franklin’s sister. The Schuyler sisters’ proximity to male power similarly helps them assert main-character status. Eliza, Angelica, and Peggy may not have been “in the room where it happened,” as Lin-Manuel Miranda puts it. But a lot of things did happen in the elegant rooms where they lived and loved. Born into a wealthy Dutch landowning clan in upstate New York, they led a cosmopolitan and politically connected existence, surrounded from childhood by political ferment. The combination of their privilege and their family’s mobility—scattered by war, public service, and personal ambition—created a rich trove of correspondence, more of which has surfaced since Chernow published Hamilton . The short life of Alexander Hamilton both feeds and fetters Vaill’s project. The book opens with his violent death, in 1804, before he turned 50. By then Peggy was dead, her health having declined after a string of miscarriages. Angelica had barely a decade left, but Eliza lived another half century. Tragic though Hamilton’s early death was, it offers Vaill a rare opportunity: less time to worry about the capital- F Founder dominating the foreground, and more space in which to figure out what flavor and texture that whole new cake might have. It also creates a rare burden: Can Eliza make history on her own? Vaill’s bold choice to narrate the family’s experience in the present tense, as they lived it, while rendering the broader course of human events in the simple past, keeps us close to the action. Indeed, it redefines what counts as action. The sidelining of women’s lives, Vaill argues, leaves readers with the illusion of “two histories”: a vivid chronicle of events without women, and quieter female annals without events. To encompass both, she swaps foreground and background. She muses: What if the painter John Trumbull—a side character in the Schuylers’ lives—had portrayed an exchange of marriage vows with the stylistic gravitas of history painting? Vaill creates that canvas, dismantling the false binary of public and private that Linda Kerber’s work analyzed long ago. Philip Schuyler, the father of Angelica, Eliza, and Peggy, was, like so many others of his day, a marriage-made man. In wedding Catherine Van Rensselaer in 1755, as the Seven Years’ War began, he increased his wealth, acreage, and political standing. He represented his Albany district in the provincial assembly in Manhattan, regularly shuttling between the two cities. As the imperial crisis deepened, he joined the second of the colonies’ Congresses in Philadelphia, in 1775; before the delegates debated independence, he departed to serve as a major general in the new Continental Army. “My heart bleeds as I view the horrors of civil war,” he wrote that spring. Meanwhile, Catherine continued to bear child after child, 15 in all. As fighting began, the three eldest Schuylers—now marriageable young ladies—attended dancing assemblies, on the lookout for mates. For a time, “the war—if it is a war yet—makes little difference in their lives,” Vaill writes. The girls’ second cousin and sometime ﻿guardian hoped to keep it that way, noting: “Our Sex are doomed to be obedient in every stage of life so that we shant be great gainers by this contest.” About this, she was both right and wrong. The Schuyler sisters and their friends, not unlike European heads of state, knew that intimate alliances cemented political ones. But Angelica, Eliza, and Peggy participated in a marriage market where young people’s preferences had begun to trump parental wishes. The sisters received gentleman callers, including, in Eliza’s case, the dashing young officer and future British spy John André. In a startling number of instances, women eloped, making their choices before parents could intervene—or even, in Angelica’s case, flying in the face of paternal disapproval. At 21, she ran off with an English émigré calling himself John Carter, a match that set the course of a wild and roaming life. A combination of lusty letters and Vaill’s writerly gifts gives Eliza’s courtship with Hamilton dramatic momentum. How quickly he pivots from assuring his bosom friend John Laurens, in 1779, that he had no use for a wife—“I have plagues enough without desiring to add to the number that greatest of all”—to telling Eliza, the following year, that his love for her has induced “a sort of insanity.” As their wedding nears, Hamilton reminds Eliza, “You are going to do a very serious thing,” because husbands “retain the power of happiness and misery.” As Abigail Adams said, all men would be tyrants if they could. Hamilton was no tyrant, but he wasn’t a very good husband, either. Low-born and yearning, he was in many ways insatiable. He told Eliza she was “a woman I love to weakness,” and he meant it. But to say that he loved women to weakness may have been more accurate. John Adams later attributed Hamilton’s passionate nature to a humoral imbalance: “a superabundance of secretions which he could not find Whores enough to draw off.” The Freudian in me senses an attachment disorder. Deprived of a father, mortified by his mother, he craved the reflection he saw in women’s eyes. Marrying Eliza was, as a friend told him, an epic “conquest” that delivered him riches and family station. His life would have been longer, and happier, had he stopped there. From the start, Hamilton ingratiated himself with Eliza’s sisters, especially Angelica. By 1781, as he fought alongside Washington to win the new country, Hamilton had begun to tuck saucy private notes for his sister-in-law into letters to his wife. In 1783, Carter, soon to be revealed as the absconded and bankrupt John Barker Church, spirited Angelica to Europe. Over the years they spent in London and Paris, Angelica adopted ever more continental manners, playing the coquette with Jefferson, the Marquis de Lafayette, and Franklin, and communicating regularly, and secretly, with her brother-in-law. Meanwhile, Hamilton drew Eliza into his public world after the war, moving their growing family to Lower Manhattan, where he practiced law and entered government. Vaill places the writing of The Federalist Papers in a busy household context, with Hamilton testing out arguments on Eliza, his “sounding board” and sometime amanuensis. When the essays were published in book form, Eliza dispatched an early copy across the Atlantic to Angelica, but not before she inked her own name on the title page, “giving herself a position of ownership, if not authorship,” Vaill writes. “ See? she all but says to her sister, I do important things, too .” In London, Angelica used her private connections to elevate her husband’s public power, scheming to ensure Church’s election to Parliament in 1790. She pitied Eliza, whom Hamilton had by then dragged to Philadelphia, the new seat of the federal government. “Are you obliged to bear the formalities of female circles, and their trifling chit chat?” she asked. But Eliza knew that the role of hostess was political. Angelica, too, helped shape Hamilton’s thinking, sending him Adam Smith’s The Wealth of Nations from a London bookshop. Men at the time acknowledged such contributions: Noting Eliza’s facility with the household accounts, Secretary of War James McHenry told Hamilton that she “has as much merit as your treasurer, as you have as treasurer of the wealth of the United States.” Would that Hamilton had had a republican mother to teach him the straight and narrow path of self-government! He might have been warier when, in the summer of 1791, a 23-year-old stranger named Maria appeared on his doorstep with a terrible tale. Seduced at 15, she’d been married, abused, and abandoned by a man named James Reynolds. Maria said she needed money, which Hamilton agreed to supply. But no sooner had he repaired to her boardinghouse with a check than he felt moved to offer softer solace. “Some conversation ensued,” he later wrote, “from which it was quickly apparent that other than pecuniary consolation would be acceptable.” As any reader of novels should have realized, the ardent Cabinet secretary with a savior complex had wandered into a trap, which James Reynolds soon sprang: He had pimped his wife in a blackmail scheme. Eliza, who had taken the children to Albany for several months, returned and was soon pregnant with the Hamiltons’ fifth child. A block away, the affair and the extortion continued. So far, so wretchedly private. Then, in late 1792, James Reynolds was arrested for fraud. When Hamilton refused him legal help, Reynolds told all who would listen that the Treasury secretary had masterminded his financial chicanery. Maria, doubtless at her husband’s direction, supplied Hamilton’s political opponents with revealing letters that she and Hamilton had exchanged. A delegation confronted Hamilton, who confessed to being an adulterer, but no thief. They took him at his word of honor, and gave him theirs. But five years later, copies of the incriminating letters found their way to the scurrilous newsman James Callender, the same columnist who would soon break the story of Jefferson’s sexual relationship with Sally Hemings. Hamilton, convinced that salvaging his fiscal reputation required him to air his personal failings, published a lengthy tract, baring all. The Reynolds affair has long been well documented. Chernow lavished pages on it, as Vaill does. His chief concern was the impact on the great man’s career; she cares more about what Eliza experienced. Nothing has surfaced to document her anguish. And so Vaill leaves the disgraced politician and his wife where the evidence does, “alone with their thoughts in the dark.” “A disappointed politician is very apt to take refuge in a Garden,” Hamilton wrote to a friend in 1802 from his new home, the Grange, in Upper Manhattan. Relegated to private life, he was in his mid-40s, father to seven living children. (The eldest, Philip, had died the year before, in a duel.) But his last two years proved anything but an idyll. They swirled with rumors and reckless dares, and, finally, public insults directed at his longtime rival Aaron Burr, whose bullet killed him in 1804. Philip, Eliza’s father, died just months later. Chernow’s Hamilton ends there; widowed Eliza gets a scant nine pages. “For Eliza Hamilton, the collapse of her world was total, overwhelming, and remorseless,” Chernow writes. Vaill has a different project, which demands different proportions. Eliza lived to the astonishing age of 97, having spent just 24 years with Hamilton. Vaill devotes about a quarter of Pride and Pleasure to Eliza’s widowhood, in a section called, fittingly, “Nameless Satisfactions.” An 1851 charcoal sketch of Eliza Schuyler Hamilton at age 94 (Historic Collection / Alamy) Vaill reads Eliza’s widowed years as a kind of breakout: Nora’s life after A Doll’s House . “Until now, she’s been—while not passive—a person to whom things happened,” she writes. “Now she begins to be, as much as her circumstances allow, a person who makes them happen.” Eliza had been enmeshed in world-historical events through the careers of her father and her husband. After their deaths, the headlines receded. And after Angelica’s, so did the family letters. Yet the second half of Eliza’s life remained quietly consequential. She joined the kinds of organizations that American women pioneered in the early 19th century—activism that made claims on the public purse and prefigured demands for formal political rights. Even as she coped with her husband’s debts and her father’s incomplete will, she focused on others less fortunate, becoming a director of New York’s Orphan Asylum Society, which tried to fill with charity the holes in a legal system that had yet to address the lives of women and children. The society had a constitution, written by women, and public meetings gaveled and attended by them. The directors petitioned New York State for an official charter, which they received, like a woman-run bank. They bought land and put up a building, housing numerous poor children. Eliza also lobbied Congress to safeguard the historical records of the Founders. She arranged and preserved Hamilton’s archive, painful though the work could be. Vaill paints a wonderful scene in which Eliza discovers, among her husband’s personal effects, “sheets and sheets of paper covered with Angelica’s distinctive slanting handwriting,” some sent directly to his office. “Suddenly all the hints and whispers and sideways glances Eliza has spent years trying to ignore make sense.” She sets them aside but does not destroy them. Her advocacy shaped Hamilton’s official papers, too. Eliza sued the politician Rufus King to repossess the documents establishing Hamilton’s authorship of George Washington’s farewell address , which she knew about because she had been in the room where it happened. Every book that has been written about Washington’s administration since—whether scholarly or popular, whether great-man or women’s history, or Vaill’s marvelous fusion of both—owes a debt to Eliza Schuyler Hamilton. In 1848, Congress invited Mrs. Alexander Hamilton, venerable relic, to the ceremony laying the cornerstone for the Washington Monument. She attended, sweltering in widow’s weeds, on July 4, weeks shy of her 91st birthday. She had lived to see the flesh-and-blood brotherhood that waged Revolution turned to marble memorials. She can’t have remembered them that way, and Vaill won’t let her readers do so, either. Her book is an act not only of recovery, but of world building, restoring the connections between home and history that made the American Revolution. Vaill’s historical and literary achievement is to convey what it felt like to be a woman who, as she writes of Angelica, longed “to put her fingertips to history,” even if she touched it only softly. Just as important, she restores the era’s male headliners to the households that nurtured and sustained them. Her Founders were fathers, and mothers, too. But for Pride and Pleasure to escape the fate of “Women at Monticello,” male readers will need to find Vaill’s truths self-evident: that women mattered to the political life of the early republic. And that household life mattered, and still matters, to history.

4ac46fbb2a35,What Is Colonial Williamsburg For?,,"Thirty-one years ago , there was a slave auction at Colonial Williamsburg. On October 10, 1994, two Black men and two Black women were led up the steps and onto the porch of an 18th-century tavern. They were made to stand in front of thousands of people as their bodies were examined by prospective buyers. An auctioneer informed the crowd that only gentlemen with appropriate letters of credit would be permitted to bid. Some in the crowd looked on in astonishment; some turned away and began to cry. That the people onstage were actors did not make the spectacle easy to watch. Explore the November 2025 Issue Check out more from this issue and find your next story to read. View More “It was done realistically, with all the horror and pain that you’d expect,” Ron Hurst told me recently. Hurst, who has worked at Colonial Williamsburg for more than 40 years, was a curator at the time. He now oversees preservation and education efforts at the site. Reactions to the event were mixed, he recalled. Some people thought it was a powerful indictment of the 18th-century injustice. Others were deeply upset; members of the local Black community had tried to stop the auction from happening. Two protesters sat on the steps of the tavern and challenged officials to call the police. How, they wondered, could the event’s organizers not have understood the pain and humiliation it would cause? The slave auction was the first and last of its kind. But it was hardly unique for Colonial Williamsburg in its blurring of the lines between performance and reality. In the ’90s, visitors might encounter the sounds of human beings being whipped, or the sight of fugitive slaves trying to escape. Black actors would portray enslaved people while white actors portrayed men on slave patrol. A few visitors attacked the white actors, attempting to wrestle away their muskets. Another visitor tried to lead a revolt against the enslavers. “There are only three of them and a hundred of us!” he shouted. The site no longer depicts slave patrols, but it does not shy away from the realities of slavery. In June, I went there to find out how the nation’s largest living-history museum is telling America’s origin story at a time when questions of how best to convey the truth about the past have become highly politicized. Since January, the Trump administration has put pressure on schools, universities, and museums to provide students with a so-called patriotic education. In March, an executive order outlined a policy to “restore” federal historical sites “to solemn and uplifting public monuments that remind Americans of our extraordinary heritage” and “unmatched record of advancing liberty, prosperity, and human flourishing.” In this environment, even private historical sites that rely on federal funding have been forced to lay off staff and halt the opening of long-planned exhibits. Colonial Williamsburg, which is run by a private foundation and receives no federal funding, has largely been spared these painful choices. Clint Smith: What it means to tell the truth about America Still, the site, which welcomes hundreds of thousands of visitors a year, has long had to consider questions of whose history it is telling, how, and to whom. The land on which it sits was purchased during the 1920s by John D. Rockefeller Jr., who used his wealth to re-create Virginia’s colonial capital with an eye toward nostalgic patriotism. Colonial Williamsburg’s founders, Hurst told me, holding his thumb and index finger about an inch apart, were seeing “a picture that was this big.” World War I had just ended, and Rockefeller wanted the site to look back fondly on the nation’s founding. This sensibility persisted through World War II and well into the Cold War. The site made extensive efforts in the 1980s and ’90s to incorporate more stories of Black life—hence the slave auction and the whippings. But critics argued that these efforts did little to change the overall narrative put forward by Colonial Williamsburg, in which, they said, slavery was not so much part of a greater set of American contradictions as a speed bump on the otherwise straight road of progress. In 1997, the scholars Richard Handler and Eric Gable referred to the site as a “Republican Disneyland.” Black people visiting and working in Colonial Williamsburg have felt these tensions keenly. Parts of Colonial Williamsburg, notably its facilities for employees, remained segregated throughout the 1950s and ’60s. In more recent decades, up through the present, Black “interpreters”—Colonial Williamsburg’s word for its employees who dress in period costume—have shared stories of being subjected to harassment and abuse from visitors: Are you going on the auction block today? How much do you sell for? On other occasions, Black interpreters have had “boy” shouted at them jeeringly or had the old Dixie anthem whistled in their direction. As we sat in front of the Governor’s Palace, where Thomas Jefferson and Patrick Henry once lived, Hurst said that Williamsburg has tried to become more thoughtful about the way it depicts the history of Black life, both free and enslaved. Today, for example, one can go on the Freedom’s Paradox walking tour, which examines how America’s revolutionary ideals of liberty and freedom could exist at the same time as the savagery of chattel slavery. “I think our founders in the 1920s and ’30s would be shocked at the stories we tell today,” Hurst said. So are many contemporary Americans. In 2023, Hurst said, Colonial Williamsburg was criticized by both “The 1619 Project” docuseries and the Heritage Foundation: “ ‘1619’ saying we weren’t doing enough history of the enslavement. Heritage Foundation saying we were doing too much. So we figure we must be in the right place.” To Hurst, talking about things like slavery is a matter not of politics, but of empirical truth. He cited the fact that more than half of Williamsburg’s population was Black at the time of the Revolution. Colonial Williamsburg, he said, has a duty to tell the stories of the people who were, in fact, the majority, most of whom were enslaved. If that makes some visitors uncomfortable, so be it. From the December 2023 issue: Lonnie G. Bunch III asks why America is afraid of Black history According to Hurst, the foundation’s board deliberately reflects a mix of political views and professional backgrounds; Carly Fiorina, who ran for president in 2016 as a Republican, serves as chair. Interpreters are careful not to give contemporary political opinions when interacting with the public, and to ground their commentary in the historical record. “We’re not trying to convince them of anything,” Hurst said. “We’re teaching them American history.” Mostly, visitors are grateful. “What we hear most often, and we hear it again and again, is ‘I had no idea. Thank you for doing this.’ ” The goal, Hurst said, is “to tell you everything that happened—the good and the bad.” But of course that isn’t as simple as it sounds. “So my nephews were shocked to hear that you owned slaves,” a woman behind me said to the man playing Thomas Jefferson. How, she asked, could this Founding Father have held people in bondage—more than 600 over the course of his lifetime, including four of his own children—while proclaiming that all men were created equal? Beneath a canopy of white oaks and red maples, “Jefferson” stood onstage in a knee-length navy-blue coat and a black tricorn hat. He leaned forward with both hands on his cane to make eye contact with the woman’s 5-year-old nephew, Nathan. “Is that the question, young friend?” Nathan nodded. The actor, Kurt Smith, straightened up. “The truth is, I grew up in one world,” he said as Jefferson, extending his left arm, “and I’m hoping to create another”—here he extended his right arm. He explained that when his father died, he, as the eldest male, had inherited everything, including his father’s enslaved property. “This is a strange thing,” he said, “to be 14 years of age and own people.” His voice became softer. “I grew up with them. I grew up in that society. And yet, in ’76 we had the opportunity to convert what we grew up with, what we literally inherited, and ask ourselves, Can we do something else? Can we do something better? Can we create a society that is different from the one that we inherited? ” Jefferson and the other Founding Fathers, of course, failed to rid the nation of its original sin; in many ways, they actively codified it. Earlier, during Jefferson’s monologue, Smith had posed another rhetorical question. “We have asked ourselves an audacious question in 1776—is mankind ready to self-govern?” “Doesn’t seem like it,” a woman said from the back row. Some in the audience laughed nervously. Others shook their head. A few hours later, I met Smith, who was still in costume, under the shade of an oak tree behind Wetherburn’s Tavern, a popular gathering place in Williamsburg in the 1750s. It was swelteringly hot and humid, and sweat rolled down both of our faces. “Can I take this thing off?” Smith asked, pointing to his wig. He fanned himself with his tricorn hat. Even when he was out of character, his voice carried the melodic cadence of theatrical performance, as if he was always within a moment of transitioning into song or soliloquy. Smith started playing Jefferson nearly 10 years ago, and is one of two people in the world who play the role full-time. (The other, Bill Barker—who plays an older Jefferson—worked at Colonial Williamsburg for 26 years before moving to Monticello in 2019.) His job involves research as well as acting: Smith told me he’s read tens of thousands of documents written by Jefferson. The day we met, he had just come back from the Huntington’s library in San Marino, California, which has an extensive collection of the third president’s letters. Smith often does a presentation on the contentious election of 1800, in which Federalists in the House of Representatives, faced with a choice between Jefferson and Aaron Burr, two Democratic Republicans, began plotting how they might steal the election , preventing either candidate from being elected by appointing someone of their choice. After January 6, 2021, Smith said, people would ask, Are you trying to say something? “And the truth is, no. This is just what’s in Jefferson’s life.” During his tenure, which has included two Trump presidencies, COVID‑19, and the murder of George Floyd, Smith has encountered visitors from all across the political spectrum. Most audiences, he said, ask about Jefferson’s slave ownership. Some people think that Jefferson has been unjustly castigated by the woke mob, while others see him as an indefensible monster. “I had someone right down the street put his finger in my chest,” Smith told me. “He said, ‘You are America’s original sin.’ ” Another time, a man stood up in the middle of Smith’s performance and yelled, “Why do you hate white people?” “I think in many ways, our job here is just to provide a place where we can talk about ourselves,” Smith said. As visitors learn America’s founding story, he believes, they inevitably make connections to the present, and think about the ways America is moving closer to, or away from, what is laid out in its aspirational documents. “It’s safer to talk about them”—colonial Americans—“even though we’re actually talking about us.” Stephen Seals grabbed his wide-brimmed straw hat to stop it from blowing away. He adjusted his glasses and straightened his brown waistcoat. Seals, who has worked at Colonial Williamsburg for 17 years, portrays James Armistead Lafayette, an enslaved man who served in the Continental Army. He estimates that he has performed as James Lafayette more than 1,000 times. Many Black people would find the idea of playing an enslaved person at a public historical site emotionally taxing or simply humiliating, and Colonial Williamsburg has always had a difficult time finding actors to fill those roles. I myself was uneasy when I realized that Seals would be doing a first-person interpretation of an enslaved man. I worried, in part, that he would try to use an exaggerated 18th-century Black vernacular in a way that can render enslaved people as caricatures and obscure their humanity and intellect. But Seals doesn’t use dialect; he wants the audience to focus less on how he’s speaking and more on James Lafayette’s story. Born on a Virginia plantation, James was enslaved by William Armistead, an ardent Patriot who allowed him to enlist in the Continental Army. James may have done this hoping his service would be rewarded with freedom. He soon began working for the Marquis de Lafayette as a spy: Pretending to be a runaway slave, he crossed British lines, pledged his allegiance to the redcoats, and became a courier on their behalf. During the remainder of the Revolutionary War, James operated as a double agent, sharing important tactical and operational information with the Americans and feeding British officials false information about American military plans. Many historians credit his espionage with helping American and French forces defeat the British during the siege of Yorktown, which effectively ended the war. In 1787, James was granted his freedom by the Virginia Assembly, in part thanks to Lafayette’s personal advocacy. After he was emancipated, he chose to adopt Lafayette as his last name. Seals is constantly reading new documents that historians have discovered and refining his presentation, and he keeps in touch with James Lafayette’s descendants. He finds it particularly gratifying when people tell him that he’s helped them understand enslavement, and the revolution itself, in new ways. Growing up in Charleston, West Virginia, and later Richmond, Virginia, Seals attended predominantly white schools that he said mostly overlooked the role of Black Americans in their curriculum, except during February. “I don’t want any Black kids coming to a historic site and not seeing themselves reflected in their history like I did,” he told me. “Because it made me worry that maybe there was no place for me in this country.” We stood together outside the Williamsburg Bray School, one of the first schools in America created to educate Black students. Ann Wager, the founding teacher, opened the school in 1760 with the aim of using it to convince hundreds of Black children between the ages of 3 and 10 that their position at the bottom of the social hierarchy was a natural one, ordained by God, and that, as such, they should be “obedient to their masters.” The school closed in 1774, after Wager died, and is the oldest remaining 18th-century structure in which Black children were educated. After undergoing an extensive renovation and relocation, it was reopened to the public this summer as a new exhibit in Colonial Williamsburg. To Seals, the site is a moving testament to the creativity, ingenuity, and resilience of Black people in 18th-century Williamsburg. Even though the school’s intent was to use education to indoctrinate Black students about their own inferiority, he said, many of them used the education they received, specifically the ability to read, to more fully imagine a future where freedom was possible, and to advocate for it. (This was before white Virginians made it illegal, in 1831, to teach an enslaved person how to read.) Seals never planned to remain at Colonial Williamsburg for this long, but he hadn’t anticipated how fulfilling he would find it to talk about slavery every day. Discussing it made him emotional. “I’m realizing just how powerful what I’ve been able to do over the last 17 years has been, and how much of an honor it is to give a voice to the ancestors after all this time.” Not every Black person working at Colonial Williamsburg has had such a straightforwardly positive experience. For Janice Canaday, who has worked at the site in various capacities for 22 years, it’s been far more complicated. Canaday attends and serves on the board of the same nearby church to which her relatives belonged generations ago. It traces its origins to the American Revolution, when a small group of free and enslaved Black worshippers began gathering on plantations near Williamsburg. They were led by an enslaved tavern worker and minister, Gowan Pamphlet, and in the early 19th century, they built the First Baptist Church on land that a local businessman had offered them. The project came with enormous risks: Virginia law prevented Black people from assembling freely, out of fear that such a gathering could lead to revolt. After the church was destroyed by a tornado, congregants built another, larger structure in 1856. They would continue to worship there for a century, until they relocated again; Colonial Williamsburg bought the second church building in 1956 and subsequently demolished it. This was consistent with how Colonial Williamsburg had approached its relationship to the Black community throughout the early-to-mid-20th century. As Colonial Williamsburg expanded, Black people were bought out, pushed out, and left out. In September 2020, a few months after nationwide protests erupted following George Floyd’s murder, Colonial Williamsburg’s archaeology department began to excavate the original church site, in consultation with the local Black community. Below what had become a parking lot, they discovered pieces of the original church building, as well as a cemetery that held the remains of more than 60 of the congregation’s members. I met Canaday, who is 68, at the excavation site this summer. “The history’s bubbling up out of the ground,” she said. Colonial Williamsburg is one of the largest employers in the area, and Canaday told me it had been a part of her life for as long as she can remember: “Everybody in my family worked at Colonial Williamsburg.” Her 91-year-old sister worked there for nearly 50 years. Her grandfather worked at Colonial Williamsburg in the 1940s. Each of her six children has worked there; one son started as a junior interpreter when he was 5. Today he drives a carriage bringing visitors around the grounds. Canaday is the first person to serve as Colonial Williamsburg’s engagement manager for the African American community. But as a young person, Canaday did not feel a connection to the site. “I never saw myself in the story,” she said. “I can’t tell you how depressing that was.” When she first applied to work there as a teenager, she told me, she was offered a job as a maid. She refused the job, seeing it as a symptom of what many in the local Black community perceived to be a flattening of their historical contributions. A local Black minister once suggested that Colonial Williamsburg was trying to bring back “slavery times.” Canaday told me that some Black people in Williamsburg still feel this way, and tell her she shouldn’t be working there. But Canaday believes that, today, Colonial Williamsburg does a better job of telling the truth about its whole history, even if some visitors aren’t always receptive to what they hear. “It depends on where they come from and how they grew up—what their grandma and granddaddy told them. Because when you tell our story”—she brought her index finger to her chest—“you’re really shaking the foundation of other people’s stories.” From the August 2019 issue: Drew Gilpin Faust on race and history in Virginia The way people react to this foundation-shaking has contributed to the difficulty Colonial Williamsburg has had in hiring and retaining Black interpreters . “You can ask any of the Black interpreters here—every week, somebody is going to remind you of who you are,” she told me. Not long ago, Canaday was taunted by a group of teenage boys wearing MAGA hats. In what seemed like an attempt to goad her, they asked her how she felt about the hats. “It’s on your head; it’s not on mine,” she responded. When they realized they could not provoke her, the boys lost interest and moved on. For Canaday, the provocations and insults she’s heard from visitors are reminiscent of her experiences being called the N-word while she was growing up in Williamsburg. Her mother would try to comfort her by telling her that eventually these people would all die off and things would get better. But Canaday doesn’t see it that way. “People die, but the idea doesn’t ,” she said. This notion, of history continuing to reverberate across generations, is central to understanding the fight taking place at historical sites across the country: The Trump administration’s attempt to reshape what is taught in museums and classrooms is fundamentally an attempt to obscure the relationship between the past and the present. It is not so much that proponents of “patriotic education” want to end any discussion of slavery because they don’t believe it happened, but more that they don’t want people to see how slavery continues to shape social inequality in America today. Clint Smith: The meaning of Trump’s attack on the Smithsonian Colonial Williamsburg’s commitment to evidence-based public history helps visitors see the relationship between the past and the present, and discover that the story of America is perhaps more complex than their textbooks had them believe. America’s founding history, the site shows, is the story of both the Marquis de Lafayette’s fight for American liberty and James Lafayette’s petition for his freedom. It is the story of Patrick Henry’s Governor’s Palace and of Gowan Pamphlet’s demolished church. It is the story of enslaved children being taught to read the Bible to make them more subservient, but instead using what they learned to forge a deeper connection to freedom. It is what Jefferson said, and it is what Jefferson did. Canaday told me about a teacher who brought her students to Williamsburg on a field trip a few years earlier. After Canaday told the group about the experiences of Black people in Colonial Williamsburg, both historically and in the present, the teacher became upset, Canaday said, and began yelling at her, saying she disagreed with Canaday’s interpretation. To Canaday, she seemed like an example of someone whose ideas would never change. But two years later, the teacher wrote to Canaday and apologized, admitting that she had been wrong. This is why Canaday believes that it is important to continue pushing Williamsburg to embrace the contradictions of American history. “We don’t always get to see what we plant,” Canaday said, nodding to a large oak to our right. “But that doesn’t mean that something doesn’t bloom.” This article appears in the November 2025 print edition with the headline “Just How Real Should Colonial Williamsburg Be?”",https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2025/11/colonial-williamsburg-historical-accuracy/684330,Culture,BBC,Clint Smith,https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/lCX2ROB-NSJ4T5whsW4KjFsiCb8=/76x196:8516x4592/1200x625/media/img/2025/09/smith_DOIcolonialwburg2Web/original.jpg,2025-10-10T09:50:00+00:00,893939f7dc8d32bbe7803ffad980c6d1c07c89eb
30af507a3e58,The Director Who Fell in Love With Losers,,"The Upper West Side deli where I meet Benny Safdie is filled with a particular kind of grumpy old-school Manhattanite. They’re the type of figure who has tended to populate the filmmaker’s movies: many of them neurotic, and more concerned with finding a means to their own ends than placating the people around them. With his brother, Josh, Benny has built a career on his fascination with these occasionally surly characters, often men on the downswing. For his first solo directing effort, The Smashing Machine , Safdie focuses on a somewhat unexpected figure: a sports champion, albeit one who is learning what it’s like to fail. “I want to know what it feels like to go through that,” he told me, over a plate of eggs, discussing the film. It’s an uncomfortable portrait—of who the winner becomes when he starts to lose. Safdie has zeroed in on one athlete in particular: the mixed-martial artist Mark Kerr, played here by Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson. Kerr—an absolute wall of a man, and thus a role befitting of Johnson—became renowned for his unassailable winning streak throughout the late ’90s and early aughts. The film’s basic plot resembles that of many traditional sports biopics. It follows the height of Kerr’s career, as well as his eventual battle with a painkiller addiction and his rocky relationship with his girlfriend, Dawn (played by Emily Blunt). But the emotional core was built upon Safdie’s animating question: “If you take somebody in a position like that, that’s really unrelatable, that’s the best in the world, but then they start faltering?” It’s a sly, sad turn in the other direction; observing Kerr’s descent, Safdie said, “allows you to learn something about yourself and the rest of the world.” For a film of this size, it’s an unusual angle to take. The movie certainly has the biggest budget of any Safdie has directed, featuring two blockbuster stars angling for awards attention. And although Kerr is a well-known name in UFC history, his notoriety came years before the sport had gone mainstream; the film illustrates its early days of semi-lawlessness, when it was dodging a perception of being both seedy and violent. Safdie’s approach is warts-and-all, delving into Kerr’s personal setbacks and the small-scale, late-’90s griminess that defined his profession. Rocky this is not, and viewers will not exit theaters punching the air. Read: ‘Warrior culture’ offers a lot, but not everything In fact, when I asked Safdie about his influences, he pointed to Rocky III as the clearest comparison for his film. “In Rocky III , he starts as the best,” Safdie said of the titular boxer’s journey. “Then what happens?” Rocky, in that movie, has to shed the trappings of fame to recapture his magic; in The Smashing Machine , Kerr has to shed his entire macho ego. Safdie’s unabashed desire to plumb a seemingly invincible figure’s decline made Kerr a wise choice for a subject, but also a somewhat bold one. Whatever desire the audience might have to root for Kerr is undermined by his mounting failures in the ring and his growing friction with Dawn. And whereas with Rocky III audiences had two movies’ worth of time already invested in the protagonist, to most theatergoers, Kerr will be practically a stranger. Johnson’s familiarity is key to bringing audiences close to Kerr and helps the film overcome its potentially alienating storyline. Unlike Kerr, Johnson might be the most famous professional wrestler who ever lived: a man who made his name in the WWE, a business that blended brute-strength athleticism with performance. He’s since evolved into a family entertainer with a sparkling smile—a larger-than-life hero that little kids can look up to, no cape and spandex necessary. Kerr’s story attracted Johnson in part because he was interested in challenging his own broad popularity. He initially approached Benny and Josh—who, together, had become known for directing high-stress crime dramedies—with the idea of a Kerr biopic in 2019. It’s easy to see what drew Johnson to them; the Safdies had given Adam Sandler, the star of the gorgeous, stomach-ache-inducing Uncut Gems , one of his meatiest and most-acclaimed dramatic roles. But COVID disrupted any planning, and when the dust settled, the Safdie brothers publicly (and, according to Benny, amicably) split . Through it all, Safdie kept thinking about the Kerr project, eventually buying a copy of a yellow Nautica sweatshirt Kerr wears in an HBO documentary about his career and sending it to Johnson. “What really affected him about that was he was like, ‘Nobody’s ever asked me to do this. They all look to me for that other stuff,’” Safdie recalled of Johnson. The project offered a rare opening for the actor to take a risk. Read: You’ve never seen Adam Sandler act this well That risk includes the fact that the role required a dramatic physical transformation—involving facial prosthetics to better resemble Kerr, which could’ve diminished his usual appeal. Yet the director resisted making Johnson totally unrecognizable. “You can still see Dwayne underneath it,” he said. “There’s a vulnerability that he allows,” which makes “you feel even closer to him.” That blend of actor and character works best when Kerr tries to get what he wants, be it a better contract or, in one of the film’s more wrenching scenes, better painkillers from an MMA-affiliated pharmacist. Seeing Johnson turn off his pro-wrestler, movie-star charm beneath Kerr’s heavy brow is somehow heartbreaking, and a little unsettling. “That was what Mark said when he saw it,” Safdie said, referring to Kerr. “He was like, ‘Wow, I know how hard it is to be that vulnerable.’” The beginning of The Smashing Machine shows us what a force Kerr could be, while demonstrating his limits as a star. His approach of pinning and pummeling rarely made for good TV; as mixed martial arts fought for airtime, it began changing its rules to keep Kerr’s overpowering style from dominating. The game starts to slip away from him and Safdie gets his camera closer and closer, trying to home in on the human beings in the ring. The darkest stuff comes not with Kerr’s addiction (which is painful, yet sad and recognizable), but in how he pushes Dawn away and belittles her at home while he contends with his losing streak. At moments during the film, I was reminded of the Safdie brothers’ 2013 documentary, Lenny Cooke , which told the story of a top-ranked high-school basketball player who went toe-to-toe with a young LeBron James, only to go undrafted by the NBA and end up struggling to support himself. That endeavor to find one’s humanity after a slump is threaded through The Smashing Machine , too. The intimate focus extends to the characters around Kerr, many of whom are played by real-life MMA fighters such as Ryan Bader and Satoshi Ishii, and the boxer Oleksandr Usyk. The film highlights mundane details of camaraderie behind the scenes of every fight, emphasizing the bonds between the fighters, who would often root for one another after their bouts were over. “They’re all friends. They all know each other. They feel bad because he gets hurt,” Safdie said. As the plot develops, we watch as Kerr goes from someone needing to stabilize his career, make money, and afford drugs to someone going into his final fight more engaged with the community around him. Sure, he still wants to win, but the pressures have changed. Perhaps above all, the film demonstrates that Kerr, in spite of his brute force in the ring, is a vulnerable guy looking for love and attention. Despite the intensity of the fights we see, we’re meant to understand that this isn’t a sport in which the competitors hate each other. Safdie recalled watching a boxing match that captures this element. “This corner man is yelling at the fighter, yelling at him, yelling at him, yelling at him. And then at the end of his speech, the fighter just grabs the guy and kisses him on the lips,” he said. “That’s the greatest thing I’ve ever seen in my life. He’s basically saying, No, I'm okay. Don’t worry about me. I’ve got this . And I just want to show stuff like that, where it’s just genuine care for each other.” The Smashing Machine can hardly be called warm—it’s standoffish in a way that is, if not unfamiliar to Safdie’s fans, perhaps a more difficult sell to the average moviegoer. But Safdie has tended to seek out complicated characters, who strive for something better amid their harsh environments; I’ve left many of his films feeling shaken to the core yet undeniably moved. Some of that earnest earthiness comes through in how Safdie interacts with the moviegoing public. When his first film, 2009’s low-budget Daddy Longlegs , was playing at a single theater in New York, Safdie stood by the entrance wearing a sandwich board , one that loudly proclaimed THIS MOVIE EXISTS! and bade passers-by to check it out. The Smashing Machine is in many more theaters than that, but Safdie is still donning the sandwich board and hanging out in lobbies. His advertising is just like his approach to storytelling: unselfconsciousness.",https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/2025/10/the-smashing-machine-movie-benny-safdie-interview/684495,Culture,BBC,David Sims,https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/S32TVB-Ys7i6OdLb3zl0Z1hQ8Dw=/1x396:1500x1177/1200x625/media/img/mt/2025/10/AH4A2321_Edit-2/original.jpg,2025-10-09T19:58:49+00:00,07af9f1753a55120cae87ea70c5d73f13d4af6bd
58d2a598fe14,So Much Madeira,,"W hen John Adams arrived in Philadelphia for the First Continental Congress, he immediately went out to eat. “Dirty, dusty, and fatigued as we were,” he wrote in his diary that night —August 29, 1774—“we could not resist the Importunity, to go to the Tavern, the most genteel one in America.” A few days later, when George Washington rode into Philadelphia, he made straight for the same establishment. Explore the November 2025 Issue Check out more from this issue and find your next story to read. View More City Tavern had opened the previous year , backed by a group of wealthy Philadelphians who’d decided there was no place in town that met their standards for decent food and drink. Although the tavern’s sophisticated culinary style was influenced by Europe, it was also uniquely American, and a reflection of the colonies’ global ties. There was likely shad from the Delaware River, fresh corn and lettuces from nearby farms, sugar and pineapples from the Caribbean, spices from Asia. But the multistory building at the corner of Walnut and Second Streets was more than just a place to eat. In addition to dining rooms, it had a bar, lodgings for travelers, and a room for coffee. It also had a subscription room, where newspapers and magazines from across the colonies and Europe were delivered regularly. The tavern quickly became a favorite meeting spot for the Founding Fathers. Thomas Jefferson took almost all of his meals there as he wrote the Declaration of Independence . Many of his compatriots routinely ate and drank in its rooms as they worked to construct a new nation. And on July 4, 1777, with the war unfolding not far away, the Congress gathered there for a meal to celebrate the United States’ first birthday. Peter Moore: The inspiration for Jefferson’s ‘pursuit of happiness’ As naval vessels filled the Delaware River that day, crowds amassed along the shorelines to cheer. When the sun began to set, fireworks, bonfires, and candles were lit throughout the city. Philadelphia glowed with fresh patriotic spirit. That afternoon at City Tavern, the delegates “were very agreeably entertained with excellent company, good cheer,” and music from a band of Hessians, Adams wrote to his daughter Abigail . Throughout the meal, they listened to toasts “in honour of our country, and the heroes who have fallen in their pious efforts to defend her.” They sat in the Long Room, a private dining room on the second floor with generous windows that allowed light to pour in. Though we don’t know for sure what they ate on July 4, 1777, we can make an educated guess based on bills of fare and descriptions of other dishes served in the period, as well as the diary entries and letters of the Founding Fathers documenting their day-to-day lives. The meal would have been served family style, with many dishes laid out on the table all at once, next to their accompanying sauces and jellies. The delegates would have started with tureens of soup set at both ends of the table. Turtle soup, a delicacy of Colonial American cuisine, used green sea turtles, typically immersing the sweet meat in a delicate veal broth with a final splash of acidity from imported sherry or Madeira wine. West Indies pepper-pot soup was a favorite of Philadelphians (it also figures in a myth about how George Washington’s troops survived at Valley Forge ). The dish came to the city by way of the Caribbean, where enslaved people working on the brutal sugar plantations had re-created a leafy-green West African stew called callaloo. One of the variations that became popular in Philadelphia utilized ingredients native to the Americas, such as chili peppers. It also used Asian spices such as cloves and mace, alongside meat like beef and pork, which had not been available on the American continent until Europeans introduced them. Large platters of fish would have dotted the table too. Sturgeon from the Delaware River were likely fastened to a spit and basted with butter, then sprinkled with flour, nutmeg, mace, salt, sweet herbs, and breadcrumbs before being dressed in a tangy sauce that usually included anchovy, lobster, lemon, horseradish, and white wine. Other fresh fish were lightly dredged in flour, fried, baked, and then garnished with parsley and black walnuts. The dense woods of 18th-century North America were teeming with wildlife, and deer, turkey, rabbit, pigeon, and game birds all likely made regular appearances on City Tavern’s tables; they would typically have been roasted over the fire in a style reminiscent of medieval cooking (it’s worth remembering that the Founding Fathers were closer in time to the Tudors than they were to us, their culture and cuisine on the cusp of a yet-to-be-defined modernity). The French gastronome Jean Anthelme Brillat-Savarin once referred to turkey as a culinary gift from the New World. At City Tavern, it was probably prepared using Old World techniques—slowly braised with onions, garlic, and bacon and then garnished with fresh herbs and gravy. Smaller plates of vegetables would have surrounded the platters of roasted meats. Potatoes, native to Peru, were a staple in the colonies—and were quickly becoming one in other parts of the world as they made their way along colonial trade routes. Cucumbers, peas, and summer squash likely gave seasonal color to the July 4 table. The quantity of alcohol served at such a meal would be astounding by today’s standards (in part because people at the time rarely drank water ). One bill from a dinner at City Tavern in 1778 for 270 people included 522 bottles of Madeira, 24 bottles of port wine, 116 big bowls of punch, nine of toddy, six of sangaree, two tubs of grog for artillery soldiers, one gallon of spirits for bell ringers—and an extra fee for the dozens of glasses and plates that, perhaps unsurprisingly, broke during the course of the evening. Read: Colonial Americans drank roughly three times as much as Americans do now The celebratory July 4 meal would certainly have kept the innkeeper, Daniel Smith, busy replenishing the finest bottles of Madeira from behind the locked bar—perhaps overhearing snippets of chatter among the delegates. But Smith, a Loyalist, may not have been in as jubilant a mood as his guests. When the British withdrew from Philadelphia in 1778, he, too, got on a ship and sailed to England . As platters emptied, they would have been removed from the table to make way for nuts, fruits, and sweet biscuits that were variously spiced with nutmeg from the Maluku Islands, in Indonesia; cinnamon from Sri Lanka; or ginger grown in the Caribbean. Perhaps there was also an apple pie. With the exception of the bitter crab apple, which is native to North America, the apple’s origins lay far away; initially from Central Asia, the sweet fruit wasn’t introduced to the continent until at least the 1500s. But by the 1800s, some sources estimate that thousands of varieties were growing in the colonies, making the apple a frequently used ingredient in America’s emerging cuisine. In time, the apple’s proliferation on American soil and the ubiquity of apple pie on American menus would help turn the dessert into a patriotic symbol. In ways large and small, the meal that took place at City Tavern on July 4, 1777, was the result of a thousand unlikely events put into motion by untold numbers of people across time and space. The foods on the table in Philadelphia that day, like the men who ate them and the country they were building, had traveled by way of the mercantile seas and through the American colonies to create the basis of a new culture, a new cuisine, and a new, revolutionary identity.

For our cover image, the artist Joe McKendry painted a tableau of figures drawn from the stories in the issue. Some of the figures will be instantly recognizable—­Benjamin Franklin, Thomas Jefferson—and some of the depictions are based on historical portraiture. The image of Paul Revere, for instance, is an homage to John Singleton Copley’s painting of the silversmith and Patriot, which hangs in Boston’s Museum of Fine Arts. The Atlantic Other figures will be less familiar. Standing beside George Washington is a man he enslaved. Like thousands of enslaved people, Harry Washington abandoned the plantation when the war began and fought for Great Britain. No image of this Washington survives. For such figures, McKendry imagined their visages, taking cues from written descriptions when possible. No occasion would have brought all of these people together in the same room (certainly, it is difficult to imagine King George in the same room as the other George). They represent different sides of the war, of the period’s political ferment, and of early American society itself. One figure existed only in a work of fiction. But together they convey the ambition of this special issue: to capture the Revolutionary era in all of its complexity, contradictions, and ingenuity. The Atlantic 1. James Madison  2.

B enedict Arnold had been growing hunkier all afternoon. Incarnated, at the moment, by Cameron Green, the director of interpretation at historic Fort Ticonderoga, Arnold had spent much of this May Friday on horseback. Sixty rain-numbed Revolutionary War reenactors had sloshed in his wake, marching up forest trails and past a Texaco station, in period-correct leather buckle shoes (not engineered to withstand repeated impact with modern Vermont’s asphalt highways) and period-correct wool coats (now ponderously wet, stinking of sheep). “Give ’em hell, boys!” a local resident had hollered from his farmhouse.

View More Saturday morning would mark the 250th anniversary of the fort’s seizure in 1775 by the Green Mountain Boys—a rumbustious militia of proto-Vermonters who spent years violently defending their bite-size territory—but so far the rain was at best blighting and at worst obliterating every enriching activity the Fort Ticonderoga staff had dreamed up. A plan for the reenactors to sleep under starlight when we’d arrived on Thursday had been downgraded to a plan to shiver in a barn all night. A plan to shoot muskets had been canceled. A plan to teach elementary-age children how to cook a meal over an open fire in a town green had devolved into a horde of famished, filthy adults flooding into a schoolroom; propping their dripping muskets against shelves of picture books; and scavenging pencil-shaped cookies leftover from Teacher Appreciation Week. Everything was going less smoothly than it had in 1775. If the partially defrosted reenactors under Cam Green’s supervision—individuals who had come from as far away as North Carolina; who had had to submit color photos of themselves in 1770s-era clothing and proof of insurance to be granted the privilege of portraying 18th-century guerrillas—​camped out again tonight, there was likely to be a mass hypothermia event. And so the majority of the group—approximately 40 men in 18th-century clothes, one 16-year-old boy in 18th-century clothes, and one reporter who had been explicitly forbidden from attempting to wear 18th-century clothes (because, a senior member of Fort Ticonderoga’s staff had insisted, she did not possess the fortitude to dress in leather breeches and buckle shoes for the first time while hiking 18 miles while conducting interviews, and he was right, he was right; thank God she had dressed in tactical hiking togs woven of such state-of-the-art ultralight moisture-wicking plastic that she herself could be said to be reenacting the life of a Poland Spring bottle )—had crammed into a one-bathroom family lake house for the night. Its living room rapidly reached the swelter and volume of a blacksmith’s forge operating as a front for an unlicensed tavern. Upon entry, about half of the company sloughed off their soaking breeches to stand around in voluminous shirts, pantsless, like giant toddlers; within minutes the place reeked of sodden natural fibers, sweaty armpits, and, intermittently, a tropical kiss of summer, owing to a decision by some of the men to repurpose some scrounged-up kids’ sunblock as cologne. “Okay, so this is not—this is not coke,” a man told me as he sprinkled a pinch of the brown powder he had just snorted off a sword onto the web of skin between my thumb and forefinger. (It wasn’t coke! It was snuff—“battle crank,” they called it—dispensed from a porcelain canister with HONOUR TO THE KING hand-painted in spidery letters on its lid.) Yet as the tide of fiascoes rose around him, Benedict Arnold (still, in 1775, a charismatic Patriot; it would take five years of grievances to whet him into the traitor of 1780 ) was becoming—I will say this as clinically and dispassionately as possible—ravishing. Cam had appeared in the barn that morning looking neat as a nutcracker. His regimental coat was festooned with epaulets (fringed) and silver buttons (dazzling). His Tresemmé waves were bound tidily back. His calves were encased in trim black riding boots with cognac cuffs. Scott Rossi for The Atlantic Benedict Arnold on the shore of Lake Champlain But as the day sploshed on, Cam came to resemble more and more a windswept pirate on the cover of a romance novel. By dusk, the men in the lake house—men with wives and girlfriends wisely absent—were cracking jokes about his comely dishevelment. One observed that Cam, a 34-year-old father in buff breeches and a billowing white shirt, had metamorphosed into the group’s “zaddy.” Cam’s hair escaped its binding. He shed his scarlet coat. His swaggering boots remained powerfully on. His swaggering boots would not come off, actually. Cam couldn’t get— huff —he couldn’t— gasp —he couldn’t get the— goddamn —boots off. Now Cam was levitating horizontally. Men dressed as sailors and farmers and fopdoodles were yanking his arms and left leg toward opposite ends of the lake house, as if attempting to pull apart a stupidly huge party cracker. Cam had to be wrenched free because the alternative—having one’s feet totally and permanently encased in period-correct leather riding boots—would be a suffocating fate, and also because he ran a real risk of developing trench foot if he slept in the boots. “How you doing over there, Cam?” In reply, a voice, muffle-crushed beneath three men who were using their body weight to pin Cam to the floor while other men pulled on his right boot, or on the shoulders of the men in front of them who were pulling on his right boot, or on the shoulders of the men in front of them who were pulling on the shoulders of the men in front of them, etc.—in a chain that extended out the door to the stairs—a voice so tiny, it sounded like it was coming from the bottom of a well: “I’m good!” Baby powder was sifted into Cam’s boot. PAM cooking spray was chhhh ’ed around the cuff’s rim. Half a bottle of olive oil was glugged down into it. Cam lay on the floor with his eyes shut in concentration as a man wearing a floral neckerchief tied around his forehead, Rambo-style, attempted to rip Cam’s foot off his body. “I’ve seen this happen before,” said a lanky apprentice leather-breeches maker from Colonial Williamsburg. “The long heel measurement wasn’t taken correctly!” Fresh hands kept appearing—at one point I counted 20 people in the bedroom—eager for a chance to pull the sword from the stone. Cam’s leg, by the way, was now fantastically slippery, because it was drenched in olive oil. A man in a red knit cap yanked as hard as he could. “That’s just—my ankle—breaking!” Cam yelped. No one suggested slicing the boots open with kitchen shears. Custom leather footwear cannot be destroyed lightly—especially if you have to wear it tomorrow because you are starring in a 250th-anniversary commemorative reenactment of the capture of Fort Ticonderoga. Scott Rossi for The Atlantic The Green Mountain Boys cross the lake in a hand-built boat. Americans have been reenacting the Revolution since before the war was even over: In 1778, a lieutenant colonel in the Continental Army wrote in his journal that his men had marked the anniversary of a “Glorious victory Obtaind over the british” at Saratoga with “a Grand sham fight.” Flurries of Revolutionary War battle reenactments were also recorded around the centennial, in 1876; participants then included many Civil War veterans, separated from real battlefield carnage by only a few summers. Reenactors have no official governing body, though many belong to associations that coordinate events among local groups, whose members share tips and gear. Estimating how many Americans participate in reenactments is a bit like trying to figure out how many people carve jack-o’-lanterns. Counting buckle-shoe sales won’t help you any more than counting harvested pumpkins would; some reenactors make their own shoes. But I can tell you that, as the United States barrels toward the commemoration of the 250th anniversary of its proclaimed independence, they are legion. Beverly Gage: America is suffering an identity crisis The reenactor community generally discourages members from claiming to be dressed as specific historical figures—though a few key roles may be assigned in highly choreographed public-facing reenactments. A reenactment of Washington crossing the Delaware, for instance, needs to have a Washington. With the exception of Arnold and a pugnacious Ethan Allen (the leader of the Green Mountain Boys, famous for yelling, as interpreted that weekend by a man named Tommy Tringale), plus a coterie of commanders at a reenactment of the attack on Bunker Hill, few reenactors I met purported to be dead people. They portrayed, instead, historically plausible types (a scraggly farmer; a wealthy townsman), which reenactors call “impressions.” Who would you be if you traveled to America’s colonial past in 2025? If you have a large disposable income, an obsessive personality, an idolatrous affection for protocol, or ideally all three, then you possess the trappings for a fine portrayal of a member of the King’s army. Top-notch redcoat impressions are renowned among “RevWar” reenactors for requiring an exceptional degree of precision, and also for their eye-bursting expense. The stiff bands of contrasting fabric, or “lace,” sewn around each button on the front of a British regimental coat can cost several hundred dollars. Again, just the part around the buttons. An entire “kit”—reenactors’ term for all the clothing, weapons, and associated paraphernalia—can easily cost thousands. (Reenactors reject the assumption that they wear “costumes,” which they do not consider functional clothing.) Scott Rossi for The Atlantic The Green Mountain Boys on their way to Fort Ticonderoga A man named Sean, who works as a military contractor—one of several Green Mountain Boys who normally “do British” but were slumming it as rebels for the weekend—told me that he likes to portray a British officer because of how hard it is. British Army reenactors, he said, possess “a desire to do things to a level of research perfection.” Unlike the tailors, sailors, and shopkeepers who took up arms against them, the British forces were professional soldiers. “We can’t look like a quote-unquote ragtag band of militia,” Sean said. “We have to look like people who, this is their job.” Emily, a college student studying music—one of three women dressed up as a Green Mountain Boy—told me she delights in “the degree of organization” and “very standardized drilling” inherent in redcoat portrayals. (Note: People who spend thousands of dollars outfitting themselves as 18th-century British soldiers reacted so strongly when I asked if they considered themselves Anglophiles—they do not—that I felt embarrassed to have even suggested they might.) If you want to be a reenactor but are laid-back, messy, or broke, you might be better suited to portraying an American. Or rather, a “Patriot”; technically, there were no “Americans” at Fort Ticonderoga or Lexington and Concord. The American Revolution began as a British civil war; before the Declaration of Independence in the summer of 1776, indignant colonial citizens considered themselves as “British” as the crimson-coated soldiers sent to patrol them. Scott Rossi for The Atlantic British soldiers and residents of Fort Ticonderoga If you have a contrarian streak, you could portray a Loyalist—a colonial civilian who supported the British Army. This is a less popular impression. On Friday morning at the Green Mountain Boys’ first campsite, standing over the simmering pot containing “breakfast” (rice mush and meat hunks, with sprinklings of rainwater), I asked Brian, a public-school teacher from Connecticut, why he’d chosen this role. “Because we’re the good guys,” he told me, with the grin of a man who has tricked his fourth-period social-studies class into engaging with today’s lesson. Loyalists “were law-abiding citizens who didn’t want a war,” Brian said. “They’re not for rebellion. They’re not for insurrection.” In lieu of breeches—too tight, he said—Brian’s kit included goldenrod-yellow plaid trousers and a coat of pine-needle green. “I’m a dirt farmer,” he replied, when I asked what sort of person might have worn such attire. “The American war for independence was started by the 1 percent, and the 99 percent fought it,” Brian told me. “It wasn’t a change for the better. Slavery increased. We were in debt.” The new government even broke its promise to pay the soldiers who had fought to create it. “Hence Shays’s Rebellion in 1786,” he said. “ Hey, man, I fought for this country and I can’t afford my farm now. It’s very sad.” (If you enjoy having sex with multiple partners, that could make you a British soldier, too— allegedly . At an event weeks later, one bubbly young reenactor portraying a Patriot civilian murmured to me out of the corner of her mouth that “a lot of the Brits are swingers.” The Americans, she said, tend to keep things more family-oriented. I was unable to confirm any of this.) Who exactly does this kind of thing? (Revolutionary War reenacting, I mean!) I met a former punk rocker who now works in marketing, a Delta pilot, a nurse, a priest, an attorney, every kind of teacher, an admin guy from MIT, a park ranger, someone who works on historical sailing vessels, a woman who retired from a software company, a guy who had a gun pulled on him during sex by his then-girlfriend, and a man who’d driven from Arizona with his wife. Many of the reenactors I met were from Massachusetts, with accents so vehement, they can be transcribed only with symbols that evolved in the lacunae of standard English orthography (“BunkÃ Hill”). Men far outnumbered women, and a bright ribbon of divorce wove through the older males, girding some and racing toward others. Most were white; the current crop of Revolutionary War reenactors might be whiter than the original Continental Army, of which Black and Native American soldiers are believed to have constituted as much as 15 percent by 1780. Many of the reenactors were far younger than I’d expected, in their 20s and 30s, though a significant portion were considerably older; nearly everyone was older than the average Continental soldier, who was 22. Reenactors can be roughly divided into two sects: “progressive,” whose members’ fervid commitment to historical accuracy typically leads to them hand-sewing every layer of their 18th-century ensembles; and “mainstream,” whose practitioners are fine buying machine-stitched garments off the rack. I met more progressives than mainstreamers but, regardless of faction, age, or gender, participants’ politics skewed markedly left. Revolutionary War reenactors, an anthropologist noted in a 1999 report for the National Park Service , tend to be politically more liberal than their Civil War peers . (This is perhaps because a person is most likely to reenact a conflict that occurred within driving distance of his or her home, and deep-blue New England was not a combat zone in the Civil War.) Three different white men emphasized to me the necessity of incorporating the perspectives of “those who only appear in legal documents, but were real human beings,” as one put it. Patriot reenactors insisted that their aim is not to lionize the Americans. “It’s not ‘The British were bad and the Americans were good,’ ” one told me. American colonists indiscriminately killed the men, women, and children they encountered already living on the continent, and imported new ones solely to enslave them. “Like, we are not this noble country here.” Multiple reenactors mentioned that they found the fiddly work of sewing historical garments relaxing. Others cited the pleasure of socializing without cellphones. A nurse named Alicia, wearing a beautifully hand-stitched gown the color of dark sea glass splattered with blood-red flowers, told me she doesn’t like the 18th-century aesthetic “at all” but enjoys reenacting this era, because many of its associated activities (solving problems without modern implements, cooking over open fires) are physically grueling and require getting dirty. One trait common to every reenactor with whom I spoke was a scorching, irrepressible desire to share factual information with strangers. Among the things I learned: It was fashionably expensive for a man to order his coat, waistcoat, and breeches “ditto”—meaning made of the same fabric and color—in which case the resulting suit of clothes would be referred to as “ a ditto suit .” An herbal analogue to aspirin can be made from decocting the bark of a willow tree into tea. Many redcoats’ coats were, in fact, slightly orange (enlisted men’s coats were colored with inexpensive dye made from the root of the madder plant; the darker carmine dye of crushed cochineal bugs was reserved for the coats of officers). The amount of forest covering Massachusetts has increased more than 100 percent since the 1830s. No one who wore one called it a “tricorner hat.” Muskets with an external safety catch, called “doglocks,” were considered obsolete by the 1770s— “Sorry,” said the 19-year-old who had just spent four minutes describing certain particulars of 18th-century French firearm mechanisms to me. “That was a lot of autism.” My foremost anxieties about pretending to live in the 18th century: 1. I would have to camp, which I hate. 2. I wouldn’t be able to wear my glasses, which I need (because, although one Pilgrim came over with a pair of spectacles in 1620, eyeglasses were still relatively uncommon in colonial America). 3. I would have to be a woman. This last one stings to admit. Because—actually—I am a girl’s girl! You can ask any girl (from a list of girls I have preapproved for questioning). My initial research into the roles of women during the Revolutionary War produced a list of horrible jobs. I could: 1. Do laundry. 2. Have sex in exchange for rice. 3. Get murdered, my death inspiring troops to battlefield glory. This last item was the job(?) of Hannah Caldwell, a mother of nine from New Jersey who was shot in 1780 while looking out her bedroom window, apparently by a British soldier. Fury over Caldwell’s killing is often credited with reinvigorating American troops; as such, she is frequently included in lists of women important to the war effort. (North Caldwell, New Jersey, Tony Soprano’s hometown, is named for her … husband.) My list was not exhaustive, of course. I could also be a nurse or cook food—okay, now it’s exhaustive. Historians estimate that some 2,000 female “ camp followers ” marched with American troops. Many of them were the wives of enlisted men; some were widows, runaway servants, or otherwise impoverished; some brought children. These women performed vital tasks in exchange for food, and George Washington complained about them repeatedly. He issued orders that “expressly forbid” the women “to ride in the waggons”—for any reason “at all.” “A clog upon every movement,” he called them. (It was as if he knew me personally.) I do not intend to denigrate the contributions of, for instance, Continental Army laundresses, who stripped the skin from their hands boiling, wringing, and scrubbing a modicum of sanitation into Washington’s fetid forces, far more of whom died of disease than in combat. This labor was strenuous, challenging, and shamefully undervalued—and that is why it was impossible to feel excited about the prospect of performing or even pretending to perform it. I wanted to shoot a gun. Scott Rossi for The Atlantic Women at Bunker Hill, played here by Gloucester, Massachusetts Irritatingly, it seemed that reenactors’ fetishistic commitment to gun safety meant that I would be stuck (with the peerless honor of) being a woman. The only thing the average reenactor loves more than accurately portraying life in the 18th century is: safety precautions. “Safety—No. 1,” I overheard one Revolutionary War veteran remind a newcomer. “Authenticity—No. 2. Have fun—No. 3.” For me to portray an armed man with an established unit, a reenactor named Dakota warned me in a phone call, would likely entail completing a “labor intensive” six-month training process that included memorizing the exercises of a 1764 drill manual until I could perform them perfectly while maneuvering a 12-pound musket (which itself would run me more than $1,000). I had stumbled into the only cranny of American culture in which firearms are tightly controlled. At times, reenactors’ twin fascinations—authenticity and preventive safety measures—​are irreconcilable. A stitch-perfect reproduction of a fisherman turned militiaman’s indigo-dyed knit Monmouth cap can lend only so much veritas to a deadly battle re-created with prescheduled water breaks. Did you know that it is against the rules of America’s national parks to pretend to die in them? If you are reenacting a real battle, that is. Reenactments that imitate exchanges of fire, hand-to-hand combat, “or any other form of simulated warfare” are prohibited in all 433 prelapsarian sites under the stewardship of the National Park Service. “Even the best-researched and most well-intentioned representation of combat cannot replicate the tragic complexity of real warfare,” the park-management guide beseeches . It is hard to argue with this, particularly if one has ever read, for instance, the memoir of Private Joseph Plumb Martin , who was 19 when he wintered in New Jersey under Washington’s command. “We were absolutely, literally starved,” he wrote. “I saw several of the men roast their old shoes and eat them, and I was afterwards informed by one of the officers’ waiters, that some of the officers killed and ate a favorite little dog.” And yet. If one’s goal is to captivate the public with wonders of the past, so much so that they might care about a former age enough to actually learn something, explosive combat reenactments are probably the most efficient way to accomplish this. Things that are shocking and terrible provoke our curiosity; if nothing ever went wrong, there would be no newspapers. Also: If you’ve spent six months learning how to properly fire a musket that set you back more than $1,000, you don’t want to just walk around holding it. It is fortunate, then, that some areas of this country (most of it, in fact) are considerably more lax about who is allowed to carry a weapon. While trying to find some work-around by which I would be able to fire an 18th-century musket without sacrificing months of my life learning how to do it safely, I heard of a ginormous reenactment of the Battle of Bunker Hill, the war’s first major contest, taking place in June. The original battle site is preserved today by the National Park Service as a darling little plot penned in on all sides by urban Boston. This precludes it from accommodating thousands of visitors eager to witness simulated slaughter. The reenactment, therefore, would be held 35 miles up the coast, in Gloucester, Massachusetts. “And because it’s not happening on National Park property,” my tipster informed me, “we have a little more flexibility.” Scott Rossi for The Atlantic An American militiaman fires his musket—­containing black powder but no projectiles—­at the Battle of Bunker Hill. But first, I would have to be a woman. After several weeks harassing various kind reenactors by phone call and email, I was dumped into the aproned lap of Stacy Booth, a member of Colonel Bailey’s 2nd Massachusetts Regiment, which provides impressions of individuals who might have lived between 1770 and 1783. Stacy was coordinating civilian activities (that is: activities relating to 18th-century civilian reenactors) for the Bunker Hill event. She agreed to help me fulfill my dream of enacting reenacting, and we decided that I would spend one day as a civilian woman and one as an enlisted man. I do not know how to sew anything, including a suite of 18th-century clothing. I got my husband to help me take a dozen persnickety measurements of my physique so that I could order custom garments from some of the foremost retailers of 18th-century-clothing reproductions—companies whose product quality, frequently mocked by hard-core reenactors, is, at the same time, generally deemed passable. Stacy introduced me to Susan Stewart, another stalwart of the 2nd Massachusetts, who agreed to help me learn to dress myself, and to provide additional clothing for me to borrow, if I flew to Boston a couple of weeks before the event. This was fortunate, because neither my custom-made “Green Linen Gown” ($385 plus shipping) nor my “Linen Frock Coat—Short Collar” ($425 plus shipping) remotely fit. (How far off were my measurements? I am an adult woman of above-average height, and the nonreturnable gown, which I donated to the 2nd Massachusetts, is set to be repurposed for a 6-year-old girl.) Within an hour of meeting Susan, I was nearly naked in her home. She laced me into my stays, instructing me in how to “fluff” my breasts upward as part of the process, and kindly yet firmly correcting my assumption that I would not be allowed to wear underwear during the reenactment. (“They did not. We all do.”) The nearly $2,000 this magazine had splashed out for my clothing, much of which did not fit, appeared to cause her bodily pain. She seriously considered spending hours altering my child-size dress, but in the end settled for loaning me virtually everything I needed, and she also made me lunch. I remind the reader that this is merely Susan’s hobby—a hobby in which she pays to participate. I felt uglier as a middle-class woman in 1775 than I ever have in my life. From the inside out, I wore: low-rise hip-hugger underwear (not period-correct); white thigh-high cotton stockings fastened with cotton ribbon garters; a white linen shift with commodious sleeves; the buff-colored linen stays, which blockaded my torso yet neglected to bestow the fetching hourglass silhouette imposed by modern corsets; a green linen petticoat (essentially a skirt split into two panels of fabric hung on cotton string); mushroom-brown hanging linen pockets (tied around my waist); a brown linen petticoat; a green linen bedgown (functionally, the ensemble’s shirt); a linen apron of bitsy blue and white checks; an enormous neckerchief hand-dyed with soft-red and dark-pink flora on a field of olive brown, folded in half diagonally and stretched over the shoulders; leather mules; and a white ruffled cap fastened around my skull with a burgundy ribbon tied in a bow (and further secured via a hidden plastic comb—not period-correct). I had removed my makeup, nail polish, wedding ring, and earrings, and inserted contact lenses. When I studied myself in the mirror of the public restroom at the park where the Bunker Hill reenactment was taking place, what looked back at me was a shapeless mound of fabrics crowned by my plain stupid face—devoid of the natural glow I daily simulate with cosmetics—and the mortifying bonnet. I probed my reflection for some trace of my own Revolution-era ancestor, whose features are a mystery to me. Priscilla Timbers was 18 in 1775 and resided in Virginia, about 16 miles (via I-95) from the farm where George Washington spent his childhood. Like me, she was the daughter of a white woman and a Black man; her mother was most likely a free servant working in the same household as her father, an enslaved man. I tried to picture myself as I imagine Priscilla: a tastefully sexy teen. Would she have looked better than I did under so many yards of fabric? How big was the bow on her cap? Did she have any inkling, in March 1775, that, as her fellow Virginian Patrick Henry thundered in a speech in Richmond, “The war is inevitable, and let it come!” Might a second- or thirdhand account of Henry’s cataclysmic conclusion—“Give me liberty or give me death!”—have reached her by June? How, if at all, would such news make its way to a really quite striking teen? Meandering through these thoughts, I was assaulted by a traumatizing realization: I am 36. I therefore, in all likelihood, more closely resemble a faintly suntanned version of Priscilla’s white mother, who was about 40 years old in 1775. In fact, Sarah’s whiteness is the only reason I am aware that her daughter existed; it created a vine of legal paperwork that curlicued across generations, hundreds of years later spiraling through free online genealogy forums, where I tripped across it one day after Googling my grandfather’s name. Under Virginia law, Sarah’s free status, impoverished as it was, conferred upon her daughter, and her daughter’s sons and daughters, the same freedom. The traces of Priscilla in written records mostly take the form of attestations in which various Caucasians state under oath that they have long been acquainted with Priscilla’s family, and know her mother to have been a free white woman; or know that certain people are Priscilla’s children and grandchildren and, thus, descended from free, white Sarah. If Sarah had been enslaved, there would be no documents to give me even this brumous view into her and her daughter’s existences. I have no idea how these members of my family, only a few generations removed from me, experienced the Revolution. This is one of the reenactors’ central points: Sarah and Priscilla were part of the reality that formed my country and my self, and I don’t know anything about their lives. The Bunker Hill reenactment coincided with the first sunny Saturday to enlighten the Boston area in 15 weeks, which may explain why some 20,000 people turned out to Gloucester’s Stage Fort Park that weekend to witness it. The organizers were hell-bent on doing it right, which meant huge, which meant six British tall ships in the harbor, which meant they needed a harbor. They also needed sufficient space (and porta-johns) for 1,000 camping reenactors, a hill for soldiers to run up, and room for members of the public to watch it all unfold. The seaside site in Gloucester satisfied all these criteria. And because the interpretation would take place in a random municipal park, people were free to die there, as long as they were only pretending to. Scott Rossi for The Atlantic The British arrive at Bunker Hill. I emerged from my tent that Saturday morning half dressed, in my bedgown and just one petticoat—Susan had promised to help lace me into my stays—and picked my way through alleys of spectral white tents to the 2nd Massachusetts’ commissary. For $20 and a volunteer shift, group members would receive five meals, plus snacks. A cast-iron pan the size of an extra-large pizza box sat atop flaming logs; inside it were more scrambled eggs than I’d ever seen in my life (“23 dozen”). Hot water for coffee dangled in a metal pail. By 7 o’clock, I was shoveling down expertly charred bacon like one who has overwintered with General Washington in New Jersey. Stacy’s husband, Mark, the captain of the 2nd Massachusetts, sipped a gleaming Capri Sun. Visible anachronisms were permitted until eight, when the event would officially open to the public. The June 17, 1775, Battle of Bunker Hill was fought between forces roughly quadruple the size of those in our reenactment. But, like the 2025 event, it did not occur on Bunker Hill. Patriot militia forces, encircling British-occupied Boston, had been instructed to work through the night to fortify a strategic position atop one of two hills—Bunker Hill—overlooking the city. When the sun rose on the 17th, it was revealed that the colonists—possibly out of a last-minute change of plans, possibly out of moonlit confusion—had built a rough defensive fort on the other hill, Breed’s Hill. That’s the one the British charged. Even at one-quarter scale, the re-created battle really was something. Weapons were loaded with black powder. Real cannons boomed every few seconds, and the rackety-crack of real muskets was constant. The smoke was thick enough to cast its own shadows upon the hill. The sulfurous scent of hell wafted on the sea breeze. The British reenactors could not help but lure the audience’s attention away from the Patriots. They moved, in their smart red coats, with ordinate intention, firing in sequence, attacking, falling back, and redoubling their fake efforts. The colonists, at first, simply picked off oncoming redcoats from behind the safety of their redoubt, until, excited and discombobulated by the macabre spectacle of the slope disappearing beneath the bodies of the enemy, they began firing randomly—all of this playing out as it had on the day, when the undisciplined Patriot forces quickly ran out of ammunition. Scott Rossi for The Atlantic Shooting and resting For someone like me, who has trouble picturing things that are not immediately in front of her, watching people run up the hill was illuminating. A historian with a mic provided play-by-play narration for the crowd, explaining actions that were inscrutable to the casual viewer. “You can see Americans are pounding stakes in the field in front of the redoubt,” he said. Why did the audience think they were doing that? “Trip wire,” a spectator in a beach chair in front of me confidently told a child. In fact, the stakes were distance markers. Smooth-bore muskets, the emcee explained, fire inaccurately beyond about 50 yards; markers like these helped the colonists hold their fire until it would be most deadly. (The possibly apocryphal imperative to delay shooting “ ’til you see the whites of their eyes” infiltrated the American lexicon from Bunker Hill.) The most difficult job any reenactor performed that day was not scattering white mice with painted red eyes around the food area (the task I was assigned at lunchtime). It was not shouting historically attested quotations during the simulated battle. It wasn’t even manning the smoldering cannons—a job that has, for centuries, put both soldiers and reenactors in a position to possibly have their arms blown off. (One cannoneer reenactor told me that her mom’s cousin “lost his hands” operating a cannon during the bicentennial.) It was being a British soldier who was killed in the redcoats’ first failed charge up the hill. These reenactors were forced to lie face down in the sun-scorched grass for nigh on an hour, baking in their red wool uniforms (and, in the cases of those outfitted as grenadiers, towering fur hats). Hours after the battle, when the spectators had gone home for the day and the undead soldiers had dusted themselves off, hundreds of reenactors, including several I had known back when they were Green Mountain Boys, gathered in the dark for a “jollification”—a chance to drink free cider, ale, lager, wine, and molasses rum that various participants had managed to procure in great quantities. An 18th-century-dressed stranger materialized out of the black night—there was no electricity at the jollification—and offered me psychedelic mushrooms. (I declined her offer.) The reenactors were still scream-singing 18th-century prison ballads when I descended the hill back to my tent, clawed myself out of my stays, and fell asleep on the ground. So many reenactors explained to me so many times the mechanics by which a marble-size lead musket ball is ejected through the (smooth, not rifled) barrel of a musket that I am tempted to recite them here, just to prove that I can. But I can’t spare 5,000 words. By the time I got to the Bunker Hill reenactment, I had heard enough musket horror stories—about a gun kicking back and breaking a man’s nose because he didn’t realize he had loaded it with three charges of gunpowder; about how, if a paper-wadded musket ball is not nestled in powder at the very bottom of your gun’s breech, “you have yourself a pipe bomb”—that I had grown afraid to shoot one. But I had begged to do it, and so I would have to. On Sunday morning, I dressed as a man in birch-colored linen breeches that fastened in front with two quarter-size buttons; a linen “work shirt” worn over a chest binder from Amazon (the latter neither period-correct nor—we’re all friends here; we can say it—greatly needed); a pale waistcoat with 12 silver buttons; a cumbersome brown frock coat; a black cocked hat; a raspberry kerchief knotted jauntily around my neck; the most discreet black sneakers I could find; and gigantic, flappy gaiters to hide them. Though the men’s kit was even more stifling, I was less bothered by my appearance in it, because I looked so completely foreign to myself. (Also, no member of the public reached out to rub the fabric of the men’s garments between their fingertips—“Nice linen!”—as one had when I was a woman in skirts.) Thus attired, I stood on the Atlantic shore, clutching the musket to what my instructor referred to as “the meaty part” of my shoulder. The gun was so heavy, I had to cantilever my upper body backward to keep it aloft. I pulled the trigger, producing a tiny fireball and a loud crack. “ Baaaaaaaah! ” I said. To my relief and delight, the firearm had not exploded in my face, maiming me for life. I couldn’t wait to put it down. In the afternoon, the reenactors staged the Battle of Bunker Hill all over again, for the Sunday crowd. On both days, nuance was pulverized in the heat of war. “These are the good guys,” a father told his son, pointing at the Patriot forces. He probably did not know that, actually, many soldiers serving the Crown held ideas about liberty that were at least as, if not more, radical than those held by many Patriots, as had been explained to me at the lake house, right before our emergency pizzas (thank you, Cam) arrived. Scott Rossi for The Atlantic The careful observer might spy signs of modernity. Watching a dozen redcoat reenactors face-plant in the grass probably did not help the assembled spectators better comprehend the horrors of war. But many did learn something. A significant portion of the crowd seemed surprised and disappointed to discover—as they watched the King’s soldiers surge over the redoubt on their third charge attempt, taunting retreating colonial militiamen—that the Americans lost the Battle of Bunker Hill. Back in Vermont, it took Cam’s men an hour to prize him out of his leather boots, which popped off in choking puffs of oiled baby powder. I was the only woman in the lake house of 41 people, and so was offered one of its three beds. (“A clog upon every movement!” Commander Washington snarled across the centuries.) The luckier Green Mountain Boys used couch parts for pillows; most lay on the bare floor. Ian, a 26-year-old preschool teacher, who had slept Thursday night on a pile of straw, spent Friday night in a closet, on a mattress of pizza boxes. When morning came, Cam was back in his wet boots. We resumed the march in winterish May drizzle and by mid-afternoon reached the spot whence, in 1775, the Green Mountain Boys launched their assault against the fort, silently sneaking across Lake Champlain. To ferry reenactors across, the astonishing Fort Ticonderoga staff had hand-built two flat-bottomed bateaux. The sun emerged while we rowed across the lake. On the New York shore, it shone through the fuzzy caterpillar heads of giant foxtail grass. The effect was enchanting, but not period-correct. Giant foxtail was introduced to North America by accident in the 1920s, mixed in with grain imported from Asia. Because I was not wearing period clothing , I could not participate in the climax of the reenactment, when the Green Mountain Boys, led by Ethan Allen and Benedict Arnold, would rush in and seize the fort. I wished them luck with the mission, and split off to claim a bleacher seat. The original Green Mountain Boys had stormed the gates at 3:30 a.m. When the commemorative reenactment—“REAL TIME REVOLUTION™ 3-Day Reenactment: No Quarter!”— began 250 years later , the first evening stars were tiptoeing out. A fort historian set the scene: The British garrison was small, he explained, occupied by only 66 people—not just soldiers, but their families as well. In real life, the Green Mountain Boys had been guided the final stretch to the fort by a local lad who knew it better than any militiaman; he had spent all that day “playing with the boys” who lived there, he later recalled. He saw the soldiers’ sons “most every day.” They were his closest friends. Scott Rossi for The Atlantic The careful observer might spy signs of modernity. A few minutes later, cries of “Halt!” and “Alarm! Alarm!” echoed off the fort’s stone entryway. Reenactors portraying British sentries were bum-rushed by a swarm of whooping Green Mountain Boys. At a word from Arnold—“Get them out of their beds!”—a horde rushed into the garrison, emerging seconds later, dragging and pushing bewildered men, women, and children dressed in flimsy nightclothes into the hollow heart of the fort. The night had grown cold, and the families were ordered to kneel on the packed dirt. Some were in bare feet. “Be careful!” a woman called out. “There’s an infant right here!” There was an infant right there—a two-month-old boy, swaddled in period-correct cloth against a reenactor’s chest. The Green Mountain Boys encircled the hostages, muskets aloft. Allen thundered a command for the British to hand over the fort. “If you do not comply, or a single gun from this fort is fired, neither man, woman, or child will be left alive!” he yelled. “What?” gasped a cowering woman. A few Green Mountain Boys flipped their muskets around and menaced the kneelers with the butt ends. “For the sake of your men and their families,” Arnold said to a British officer, “surrender this post.” All of this was surprisingly upsetting to witness. These were my sweet Green Mountain Boys? The ones who had spent two days drawing my attention to interesting birds’ nests we marched past, sharing with me the orange peels they had candied themselves, and teaching me about buttons? When I’d first been introduced to them, they had been interchangeable old-timey people. Now I could easily distinguish between the beech-nut and ash browns of their wool coats. I knew exactly how damp those coats were, how overpoweringly they reeked of wet sheep. That was Emily, the fifer, dragging a man out of bed. That was Wilson, the genial leather-breeches maker, shoving a soldier to his knees. These were my friends? Holding a baby hostage at gunpoint? When the fort commander surrendered his sword, shrieks of glee ripped from the throats of the Green Mountain Boys. I spent the night in a Super 8 and, when I returned to the fort the next morning, was jarred to realize that the reenactment had resumed. Oxen were taking part in it now; they were being used to tow the imprisoned soldiers’ belongings, as the British-garrison reenactors—now prisoners of war—were marched toward the parking lot. When, I wondered, would the past end? I spotted a Green Mountain Boy I knew, Avi, and confessed to him that I’d found the reenactment unsettling. “It was a big tragedy,” he said. “These people”—he cast his eyes over the parade ground—“were as American as us in a lot of ways.” This, perhaps, is the chief merit of reenacting: not that it glorifies past accomplishments or condemns past failures, but that it emphasizes how any action humans have ever performed, whether for good or for ill, has been carried out by ordinary women and men. The Green Mountain Boys were not hellhounds. They were farmers. Kind and generous fellows were no doubt among the British soldiers killed at Bunker Hill. George Washington turned out in clean military dress because women did his laundry. This is an emboldening and disquieting way to apprehend history: not as a logical march toward an inevitable destination, but as a free-for-all dash subjected to the whims of regular people. It could end up anywhere. And if people in the present fawn over history, it is no less true that many in the past were preoccupied with how the future would regard them. Take, for instance, these lines of poetry commemorating the 99th anniversary of American independence, in 1875: They pierced the veil Of distant years, lov’d us, although unborn, And purchased, with their arms, and purest blood, The bright inheritance we now enjoy. The sentiment strikes 21st-century ears as unremarkable; we are accustomed to adulating the revolutionaries. But, in fact, the words sweat on the page. The poem, titled “The Anticipation for the 99th Year of American Independence,” was published in 1780, in the middle of the war. Independence was a fantasy, not yet secured. The writer dreamed of someday being remembered kindly—hopefully by Americans.

9f241e65068e,Why Did Benjamin Franklin’s Son Remain Loyal to the British?,,"O n the whole , the Founding Fathers, those towering patriarchs, fared poorly when it came to sons. George Washington and James Madison had none. Thomas Jefferson’s only legitimate one died in infancy. Samuel Adams also outlived his. With the exception of John Quincy Adams, no other son of a Founder rose to his father’s stature. The unluckiest of all may have been Benjamin Franklin, who, in the course of a deeply familial contest, lost a cherished son the hardheaded way: to politics. Explore the November 2025 Issue Check out more from this issue and find your next story to read. View More The two were for years each other’s closest confidant. As one associate noted, William Franklin had, by his late 20s, become his father’s “friend, his brother, his intimate and easy companion.” Franklin raised his son with all the advantages he had not enjoyed. Where he had only briefly attended school, William studied with a private tutor. He kept a pony. He signed no indenture papers. Similarities surfaced early. Around the time he turned 15, William ran off to join the crew of a ship docked in Philadelphia, from which his father retrieved him. Franklin could hardly argue with the dash for freedom, having made his own at 17. He too had longed, as a youth, for the sea. Shortly after his escapade, William was allowed to enlist in the British army. The concession seemed to affirm that he in no way suffered from the brand of “harsh and tyrannical treatment” that Franklin had known as a boy, treatment he thought might explain his later aversion to arbitrary power. He was, and knew he was, an indulgent parent. He once counseled a friend to give a child all he wanted, so that the child would develop a pleasant countenance. William was exceedingly handsome. William’s military career ended in 1748, with the conclusion of King George’s War. While studying law, he over the next few years stepped into a string of political posts as his father vacated them. Father and son joined the same clubs and supported the same charities. They performed electrical experiments together and campaigned for office together. They were nearly shipwrecked together when, in 1757, they sailed to London, where together they visited the British Museum and watched David Garrick play Hamlet. (A fiancée of whom Franklin disapproved was left behind, soon forgotten by William.) William made business calls on his father’s behalf when Franklin found himself confined, by a months-long illness, to bed. He took his dictation. Oxford conferred an honorary doctorate on Franklin in 1762 for his electrical discoveries. Farther back in the same procession marched William, then in his early 30s, who received a master’s degree. Read: Ben Franklin’s radical theory of happiness Deeply grateful for his father’s “numberless indulgencies,” William in 1758 professed himself willing to follow him to America, or to go to “any other part of the world, whenever you think it necessary,” and he did. The two traveled around the British Isles and to the continent, from which they returned in time for the 1761 coronation of George III. (William alone obtained a special ticket that allowed him to join the procession, all the way into Westminster Abbey.) They visited Northamptonshire, where Franklin filled in some blanks in the family history. He returned to that visit later when he began his Autobiography , which masquerades as a letter to William. Illustration by Maggie O’Keefe Friends commented on how much the two men resembled each other in manner and bearing. There could be no tributes to the other side of the family; it was common knowledge in Philadelphia that Franklin’s wife was not William’s mother. If William knew her name, he was among the few who did. For all intents and purposes, he seemed to have been the love child of Ben Franklin and Poor Richard. His mother’s identity frustrates us as much today as it did the 18th-century gossips, who turned her—especially in the thick of an election season—into an abused handmaid or oysterwoman, left by Franklin to beg in the streets. She was likely a household servant for whom Franklin provided, having arranged to raise their son himself. The stain of William’s birth reared its head in London only when—at a surprisingly early age—he was named a royal governor. He was too young to have made enemies of his own, but his father’s weighed in loudly. For years William would face down cracks about his “exalted birth.” As a rule, royal governors were gentlemen, if not always gentlemen with experience. Franklin was not on hand when William married that fall in London, but he was very much on hand for William’s 1763 New Jersey inauguration. He had reason to feel proud: The son who had grown up above a Philadelphia print shop, the keeper of his secrets and his political alter ego, was now “His Excellency William Franklin, Esq., Captain-General, Governor and Commander in Chief in and over the province of New-Jersey , and territories thereon depending in America, Chancellor and Vice-Admiral in the same.” William looked forward to “an easy agreeable administration.” In an office that did not count among his father’s hand-me-downs, he came into his own, proving an especially able governor, if one who continued to submit reports to his superiors first to his father, for editing. From the February 1871 issue: The story of Dr. Franklin’s famous book In 1764, Franklin returned to London as a colonial agent. An ocean away, William remained expert at guessing which essays in the press were his father’s at a time when “An Admirer of Truth and Goodness,” “Timoleon,” and “Undeniable Facts” counted as bylines. If The London Chronicle reminded the arbiters of colonial affairs of “the lasting power of resentment on the human mind,” William was quick to recognize the hand behind it. When rumors flew in the colonies that Franklin had personally designed the Stamp Act, William refuted the charges. When his half sister fell in love, William stepped in, on his father’s behalf, to attempt to head off what seemed a disadvantageous marriage. (He was unsuccessful. The purported fortune hunter became his brother-in-law.) Franklin’s most intimate letters—the reports on the compliments that puffed him up, the hints that he might expect an appointment in the British administration, the violent longings for home—went to William. With no other man was Ben Franklin ever so naked on the page. A spark of discord flared in 1773, after Franklin mailed a packet of confidential Crown correspondence to Boston, to sensational effect. Not for a minute did the royal governor of New Jersey believe his father capable of retailing stolen letters of his fellow Crown officers; he was appalled to discover him behind such a morally dubious transaction. As Franklin explained once his secret was revealed, he had hoped the documents might temper colonial animosity toward London. He did not mind throwing a royal governor—at least a Massachusetts royal governor—under the bus. He had come around to the belief that Parliament “has no right to make any law whatever” for the colonies. He knew William disagreed but would not attempt to convert him. He hoped only that William would act with integrity, leaving his constituents happier than he had found them. That was before Franklin was hauled before the Privy Council to answer for the stolen letters and—in a quirk of timing—take the blame for the destruction of the tea in Boston Harbor, in which he had played no role. He had believed himself impervious to censure. A brutal, public evisceration proved him wrong. His first instinct, days later, was to suggest that William resign in solidarity. Given Franklin’s disfavor in London, William could expect no promotion. (William had been angling for a more lucrative post in Barbados. For years, Franklin had subsidized New Jersey’s royal governor, his salary insufficient to meet his needs.) Two weeks later, Franklin changed his mind. Surely the Crown would expect a resignation. He preferred to deprive it of that satisfaction. The advice hardly mattered, as William had not the slightest intention of resigning. He did assure his father of one rule of colonial physics; with the London drubbing, Franklin’s American popularity soared to new heights. William permitted himself to vent a little about the absurd entity that called itself the Continental Congress. The split screen opens around this time: William was shocked that Boston had no interest in reimbursing the East India Company for the 342 chests of tea the town had launched into its harbor. By September 1774, Franklin was arguing that Parliament should reimburse the company’s loss, with the monies it had extorted from the colonies. Then, as if out of the blue, came a poisoned dart. “But you,” Franklin wrote to his son, “who are a thorough courtier, see every thing with government eyes.” By the time he replied, in late December 1774, William had cause for anger. He was fresh from having buried his stepmother. Her disappointment in not having seen her husband in a decade, William reported, lips pursed, “had preyed a good deal on her spirits.” He could not understand why his father remained abroad. Franklin would change no minds in London, where he was regarded with “an evil eye” and where he risked arrest. Would he not be more useful quieting the turbulent spirits in America? William assumed the paternalistic role, reminding his father of his responsibilities; it was the older generation that had been radicalized. However lunatic Franklin might think the London administration, surely he had to admit that there was equal lunacy in America. This was, William ultimately acknowledged, “a disagreeable subject, and I’ll drop it.” As he finally sailed for Philadelphia in 1775, Franklin composed the longest letter we know him to have written , a 196-page behemoth that catalogs the raised and dashed hopes of his final London months, during which he labored—in a tour of drawing rooms and a round of covert discussions, with sweet words and in “cool sullen silence”—to work out an Anglo-American compromise. He reported on the searing insults and abject flattery; the hints of bribes; the contempt for a people understood to be “the lowest of mankind, and almost of a different species from the English of Britain”; and his conviction, in the end, that the House of Lords appeared “to have scarce discretion enough to govern a herd of swine.” This account he addressed to the son whom he had not seen in a decade. As Dr. Franklin wrote on the high seas, Governor Franklin was secretly passing every scrap of intelligence he could gather on the activities of the Continental Congress to London. Franklin disembarked to the news that shots had been fired at Lexington and Concord. There was an additional wrinkle. Illegitimate children seemed to run in the family. With Franklin sailed William’s 15-year-old son, Temple, born in London. Neither William’s wife nor the rest of the family knew of his existence. Initially William hoped he might introduce Temple as the son of an unfortunate relative whom he had agreed to raise as his own. Franklin preferred the direct approach. “I brought over a grandson with me,” he baldly informed his sister. There is no record of how William’s wife greeted the news of the instant stepson with the polished manners, who impressed even his hard-driving grandfather. Franklin had taken charge of Temple’s education, a statement that spoke volumes, as did the fact that Franklin billed William for the expenses. Along with much of America, William waited to see on which political side his father would land. Franklin remained so tight-lipped that some wrote him off as a British spy. The reserve persisted for some time, though William had his suspicions, as would any close reader of that 196-page letter. More than anything, he wished that his father would retire from all public affairs. He warned him that if Franklin intended “to set the colonies in a flame, he would take care to run away by the light of it,” a friend later recalled. When finally it came, the confrontation was loud. At William’s stately New Jersey home that summer, the two men quarreled so violently that they roused the neighbors. Franklin warned William that his position would soon prove uncomfortable, as William well knew. As early as June 1775, he anticipated arrest. His legal authority seemed at an end. His militia no longer reported to him. He begged London to observe strict secrecy with his correspondence, every shred of which could prove his undoing. Despite the dangers, he assured London that nothing would induce him “to swerve in the least from that loyalty and duty, which I owe His Majesty which has been the pride of my life to demonstrate upon all occasions.” Not for the first time, a tussle broke out over the word patriotism . In America after 1775 an honest patriot subscribed to American independence. In the mind of the New Jersey royal governor, those individuals were “pretended patriots,” “desperate gamesters,” “banditti,” and delusional dupes. “A real patriot,” William informed his disgruntled legislature, “can seldom or ever speak popular language. A false one will never suffer himself to speak anything else.” Those lines figured in his last address as governor. As his father read drafts of the Declaration of Independence, William was carted off, to jeers and insults. He refused to answer questions, railed that the Continental Congress had usurped the King’s authority, and attempted escape. Under heavy guard, he reached Connecticut on July 4, 1776. He left behind a wife nearly out of her wits with fright. As the son of a leading Loyalist and the grandson of a leading Revolutionary, Temple turned overnight into a sort of walking embodiment of civil war. To deliver word from his stepmother, he requested Franklin’s permission to visit his father in prison. It was denied, but not, as Temple parried, because Franklin feared that his grandson might share dangerous intelligence. At his address, William could make little use of such information even if Temple happened to impart it, Franklin dryly observed. Temple might retire any political suspicions; Franklin was acting solely from “tender concern” for his welfare. He belonged, Franklin chided, at school rather than rambling about Connecticut. Or so Franklin wrote on September 22. He was soon to have a better idea. William meanwhile remained recalcitrant. For collaborating with British officers while on parole, he was transferred to solitary confinement in a filthy cell. He felt buried alive, in the company of rats. He preferred to be taken out and shot. After three months he appealed, in moving terms, to George Washington. William could hardly eat or sleep. He was “one of the most miserable wretches breathing.” His wife’s failing health was paramount in his mind. Might he be granted permission to visit her? He assured Washington that his father, too, would be grateful were he to grant William’s request. The two men differed in their political convictions, “yet it has not lessened his natural affection for me, any more than it has mine for him, which I can truly say is as great as ever.” If Franklin knew of the appeal, he made no effort to intervene. By the time William emerged from prison, he looked his father’s age. He was also a widower. William did not share Franklin’s gift for “cool sullen silence.” When the time came to discuss a prisoner exchange, he made for a poor candidate, as he seemed unlikely to desist from launching counter-Revolutionary raids. His stubborn loyalty is easier to explain than is Franklin’s stubborn anger. A royal governor for 13 years, William had finally clambered out from under Franklin’s shadow. His father’s politics had spoiled the earlier love affair, from which the London trip had removed him. William may have been unwilling to submit to a second sacrifice. It could not always have been easy to be Ben Franklin’s son; a little rebellion may have brought relief. William had moreover swallowed an early, heady dose of Anglophilia. Only one Franklin had processed into Westminster Abbey with George III. Before the war divided father and son, the two joined the same clubs, supported the same charities, and conducted electrical experiments together. (Universal History Archive / Getty) The royal governor of New Jersey had moreover heard enough about base-born bastards. Respectability mattered to him in a way it did not to his iconoclastic father, whose rags-to-riches story appeals more to us than it did to the Philadelphia elite. William initially resisted arrest because he refused to answer to an illegal assembly but also because his inquisitors had failed to treat him as a gentleman. The assault on his authority was an attempt to “filch from me my good name,” he howled in 1776. That name was “of more value than all other considerations,” as he later explained. For it he maintained always an outsize regard; his father tended to let the insults fall where they might. Having arrived at last at an exalted status, nothing would pry William from it. He had risen above dishonor. Where Franklin well knew he had difficulty submitting to his superiors, William prided himself on his devotion to the King. While Parliament drafted the 1774 Intolerable Acts, he insisted—as he alone among Crown officials needed to do—that “no attachments or connections shall ever make me swerve from the duty of my station.” From the earliest days of his governorship, William professed himself willing to risk his life in His Majesty’s service. And by 1775, he had begun to feel more validation from the British administration than from his father. The tragedy was that for all his eloquent tributes to the Crown, he remained Ben Franklin’s son, suspect, for different reasons, in both camps. Or as Lord Howe’s secretary put it while William languished in prison, “His father is and has been every way his misfortune.” Both men availed themselves of substitutes. When Franklin sailed to France in late 1776 to secure aid for the Revolution, he did so with Temple in tow. He needed a trusted secretary. Temple was excellent, bilingual company. A European education was at the time superior to an American one. The exchange also constituted a bit of underhanded score-settling, as Franklin acknowledged. He had, he wrote several years later, rescued a valuable young man from the clutches of the Tories, instilling in him honest republican principles. “It is enough that I have lost my son ,” Franklin cried, in a rare nod to the emotional toll, for which he enlisted an equally rare exclamation point. “Would they add my grandson! ” William was long in learning of Temple’s departure and flabbergasted when he did. Christmas Eve 1776 found Temple at Versailles, the ideal messenger for a sensitive, exploratory overture to the French minister of foreign affairs. Having raised an Englishman, Franklin over the next years inadvertently raised a Frenchman, which is what happens when you send an impressionable adolescent with a carriage and servants on an overnight mission to Versailles. No word passed between father and son over the next nine years. Friends evidently intuited that it was best not to mention William to Franklin, though occasionally someone blundered ahead. Family members tiptoed around the awkwardness by referring to William, when necessary, as “Temple’s father.” Franklin’s Parisian friends universally spoke of Temple as Franklin’s son, erasing the intermediate generation. So as not to muddy either the political or familial waters, Franklin discouraged Temple from any contact with his father. Comfortable at Versailles, devoted to his grandfather, Temple ably acquitted himself of his duties. Franklin had great ambitions for the teenager, on whom he doted. He seemed to understand that he had been granted a do-over. He did not intend to get this one wrong. “The doctor,” the Marquis de Lafayette would note, introducing Temple to General Washington, “loves him better than any thing in the world.” Franklin had his work cut out for him in Paris, where Congress expected him to appeal to a monarchy for assistance in establishing a republic. Surrounded by spies, at odds with his colleagues, forced to proceed by stealth in a second language and an unfamiliar culture, Franklin had difficulties enough without having to hear of his son’s Loyalist activities. Those reports came his way all the same, especially when William made a noisy 1782 return to London. Given the prison time, he was no longer simply a Loyalist. He was a Loyalist hero. Franklin claimed that he made it a fixed rule never to confuse private and public resentments and the evidence is largely on his side. When the time came to negotiate a peace in 1783, however, no one argued so vehemently against compensating the Loyalists for their lost American properties as the sole commissioner with a Loyalist son. If the people whom Franklin preferred to call royalists—he believed the true Loyalists to have been those who had fought for American liberty—were to be compensated for their losses, surely the Americans should be too? Coolly conflating the personal and the political, he cited the destruction of his library, carried off by the British officer who had occupied and looted his home. He happened, as Franklin surely knew, to be an associate of William’s. Franklin relented a little in 1784, hinting that he would welcome renewed contact with William now that the countries had settled their differences. William was surprised, having concluded from his father’s “total neglect and inattention” during his prison years that the relationship was over. Leaping at the overture, he offered to come to Paris. He himself had buried all his American hatchets at the signing of the peace. He hoped “to revive that affectionate intercourse and connection which till the commencement of the late troubles had been the pride and happiness of my life.” (The line rhymes with the 1776 “pride of my life” tribute to George III.) William believed he had acted purely out of duty to his sovereign. Given the same circumstances, he would comport himself no differently. He was forthright: “If I have been mistaken, I cannot help it. It is an error of judgment that the maturest reflection I am capable of cannot rectify.” He hoped they might each forget the past. He refrained from any mention of his father having spirited off his son. From the November 2005 issue: Free and easy Franklin agreed to the mutual amnesia, though not before hurling a few thunderbolts. Nothing had ever hurt him so much as the abandonment in his old age of his only son, who had gone so far as to take up arms against him “in a cause wherein my good fame, fortune and life were all at stake.” He could have understood had William remained neutral. But “there are natural duties which precede political ones,” stressed the man who had defied his parents and missed his wife’s funeral and both children’s weddings. Consciously or not, he echoed William’s 1774 words: It was a disagreeable subject. He would drop it. He preferred William not come to Paris, but—bowing to Temple’s ardent wishes—Franklin would send Temple to London. He submitted operating instructions. Franklin intended Temple to study law. William was to supply him with his old law books. He should introduce him to no improper company. He could confide any and all family matters in Temple. They had no secrets. Temple appears to have had at least one: Franklin seemed unaware that the 24-year-old left behind in Paris a (married) mistress, pregnant with his child. Franklin often could not remember to be angry. He shied from open confrontation. He found disputes as useless as they were unpleasant. Most of all, he reminded feuding relatives, he disliked family feuds. He insisted that he preferred immortal friendships to immortal enmities. Both he and Poor Richard advocated always for forgiveness. But he could not, or would not, fold William back into his affections. The embarrassment and dishonor, the sense of betrayal—all words he avoided, preferring to detour around what was for him the greatest casualty of the war, which had cost him his best friend—ran too deep. He continued to believe there was not a man on Earth who could justly say that Ben Franklin had wronged him, wholly overlooking the one in London. He could brook dissent—he corresponded with any number of friends who saw the Revolution differently—but not by someone who shared his name. Long after he had signed the Treaty of Paris, establishing America’s existence, Franklin remained implacable on the subject of Loyalist compensation. A hired assassin, Franklin conceded , “has a right to his pay.” But surely his employers should compensate him rather than his victims. He loaded his anger into an unpublished fable , writing off the royalists as a fratricidal “mongrel race,” lines he could not have written without realizing that his own son belonged to that genus. To the end of his life, the resentment burned bright. “We are commanded to forgive our enemies,” he reminded one correspondent, “but we are nowhere commanded to forgive our friends.” There was a brief 1785 reunion in Southampton, as Franklin prepared to sail to America. It was probably not much helped that he could have read, days earlier, that William continued to petition the Crown on behalf of the Loyalists. Franklin was affectionate in person but also adamant that William assign his American properties to Temple, to settle his debt to him for the years of subsidies. William balked. The properties were worth twice as much. He assumed he was being penalized for his politics, as he indisputably was. He was wounded; the transaction drove home that his father “preferred my son’s interest to mine, and that I held not an equal place in his affections.” For the sake of family harmony, he agreed all the same to his father’s terms. Franklin afterward went silent, refusing to answer his letters. Temple explained that he was offended still by William’s bristling at his terms. On the rare occasion when he referred to William, Franklin explained that they were estranged and that William kept aloof, which was untrue. Father and son never saw each other again. When Franklin’s will was read in 1790, William discovered that he had essentially been disinherited all over again. The first item was a rebuke for the wartime part he had played against his father, a part, Franklin added revealingly, of “public notoriety.” William was struck by Franklin’s “shameful injustice” but also furious for practical reasons, having made little progress with the British administration in securing reparations. To prove his loyalty to the King and to put an end to a rumor that he and his father had hedged their bets, he had submitted Franklin’s pitiless letters to him, now lost. Not only had there been no collusion, but he had placed his duty to his sovereign over “the wishes of a revered parent.” In the process he had forfeited every shred of his father’s affection. Having claimed damages of £48,000, William received £1,800, along with a pension that barely covered his London expenses. (When his sister came to visit, he regretted that he did not have room to put her up. There had been multiple guest rooms in the New Jersey mansion, far more lavish than Franklin’s Philadelphia home.) Temple returned to London after Franklin’s death but preferred Paris, where he settled after siring a second illegitimate child. (The first had died in infancy.) Franklin’s son and grandson quarreled. William wrote Temple out of his will, substituting his granddaughter. William was more hurt, he claimed, than he had ever been. He did not relish the idea of “dying at enmity with one so nearly connected.” He and Temple never reconciled. Aside from his supersize 1775 letter, Franklin left only one other piece of sustained writing. Though he added to his Autobiography nearly until his death, he never carried the story of his life beyond the late 1750s, when he was still a loyal British subject. William, too, endures as a devoted subject, if one who fades from view in the book’s later sections. The “lasting power of resentment on the human mind” figures nowhere in Franklin’s pages, the most popular autobiography in America and a clear-eyed ode to tolerance and reason. Franklin had ample opportunity to revise the work, and he did. He never touched the first words, which remain “Dear Son.” This article appears in the November 2025 print edition with the headline “Dear Son.” When you buy a book using a link on this page, we receive a commission.

a84a3d39e177,What We Learned FilmingThe American Revolution,,"On June 24, 1778 , a total solar eclipse covered a wide swath of North America—from the Pacific Coast of Mexico to Virginia’s Eastern Shore. The eclipse occurred just a few days before the Battle of Monmouth, when George Washington’s Continental Army engaged General Sir Henry Clinton’s British Army—a standoff that nevertheless allowed the Patriots to claim a much-needed victory. The British, meanwhile, continued their retreat from Philadelphia to New York City. We wanted to depict this eclipse for our series The American Revolution , and in this we had a stroke of luck: There would be a total solar eclipse across much of North America on April 8, 2024. Explore the November 2025 Issue Check out more from this issue and find your next story to read. View More Filming the eclipse would be technically complicated, and if we were hampered by clouds or anything else—if we failed to get the shot—there could be no second take. (The next such eclipse in the United States will occur in 2044.) Our crew headed north from New York City, armed with four cameras. Three would be pointed at the sky and the fourth at the sun’s reflection on water. The exposure was going to change wildly in the course of the eclipse, and totality would last only a few minutes. We had intended to film in western New York, in what had been Seneca Country in 1778. But changing weather forecasts pushed us to consider other locations, and we ended up far to the east, in the Adirondacks. Somehow, everything worked out, and the footage we got is some of the most stunning camerawork in the series. Challenging though it was, filming the eclipse was in one sense easy: We knew when and where it was going to happen, and we knew the effect would be powerful. Endeavoring to make a 12-hour documentary on a subject that predates the invention of photography, and whose sources are written in an 18th-century vernacular, was in other respects a daunting mission. For our series on World War II and the Vietnam War, we could talk with living witnesses and access archival footage. We had tens of thousands of photographs from the Civil War. The American Revolution had none of those elements. Read: Ken Burns tells America’s history through six photographs Our subject was also complicated by the myths that enveloped it. Generations of Americans have wrestled with the meaning and reality of the American Revolution, our national origin story. Even in 1783, John Adams knew how hard it would be to tell that story. “It would require the whole of the longest Life,” he warned a French historian , “to assemble from all the Nations and Parts of the Globe” all of the documentary materials needed “to form a compleat History of the American War, because it is nearly the History of Mankind for the whole Epocha of it.” The French historian never wrote the book. As the historian Maya Jasanoff points out in the film, coming to terms with the Revolutionary War is an almost impossible task. The stakes are so high, the events so complex, the mythology so entrenched, “that it has made the way that Americans think about this period very unreal and detached.” The challenges of making the documentary, by contrast, were quite concrete. We tried to capture the lives of the millions of people the Revolution affected—to make the uncertainties of their time palpable and vivid, even though we all know the outcome, and to represent faithfully the circumstances in which so many people chose to fight for and against the Revolution. This work led us to new perspectives on the fundamental questions about the founding: What is the role of government? What responsibilities come with the privilege of citizenship? What would I be willing to risk in the service of my country and my principles? What am I willing to die for? By January 2024, Philadelphia had gone almost two years without an inch of snow on a single day. For many people, this was a welcome relief. For our team, it was a big problem. The Pennsylvania State House (now Independence Hall) was the Patriot seat of government for much of the war, and Congress stayed in session there through several winters. We had already filmed winter scenes in Deerfield, Massachusetts; Valley Forge, Pennsylvania; and Ticonderoga, New York, among other locales. But the winters of the Revolution were notoriously harsh, and the film wouldn’t be complete without more snow. With a major winter storm expected to hit the East Coast from the Chesapeake Bay to the Canadian border on Martin Luther King Jr. Day and the following Tuesday, we quickly mobilized. There was an obstacle: Historic sites would be closed for the long weekend, and their staff hard to reach. We had to plan everything overnight, get permits ironed out, and send four camera crews in four different directions: to Providence, Rhode Island; Charlestown, New Hampshire; Tivoli, New York; and Philadelphia. We came back with beautiful footage—and a realization. The East Coast’s ever-changing, unpredictable climate was at times our most unanticipated and vexing adversary in bringing the story of the Revolution to life. Even with all the benefits of modern weather forecasting, along with plowed roads and airport deicing, we were still at its mercy. That constant challenge made what Washington and the American soldiers faced during their war all the more remarkable to consider. Weather guided the course of the Revolution far more than it guided our production. Eliot A. Cohen: The secret of George Washington’s revolutionary success “Turns of weather that we know are coming for weeks on end hit the people of the 18th century completely by surprise,” the writer Nathaniel Philbrick explains. “They’re not just fighting each other. In a profound way, they are fighting the American climate and geography and topography.” Weather became an unexpected and unheralded character in deciding battle after battle: What an American private called an “outrageous” storm contributed to the Continental Army’s doomed assault on Quebec City in 1775; what the historian Rick Atkinson describes as a “providential fog” saved Washington’s army by allowing it to escape to Manhattan after the disastrous Battle of Long Island in 1776. Weather was not the only unpredictable natural force at play. From 1775 to 1783, far more people succumbed to disease than died in combat. Typhus, typhoid, dysentery, and, worst of all, smallpox—that “dread disease of humanity,” as the historian Colin G. Calloway calls it—incubated in fetid army camps before spreading across the continent. Even people far from the battlefield —on the Pacific Coast, in Spanish Mexico, and in the Caribbean—suffered from the war through famine or epidemic. Few in North America were untouched by the Revolution. The process of filmmaking brought an intimate understanding of geography as well as weather. Archival maps are works of art, and we use many in the film. They told us where troops were positioned and what commanders were thinking as they drew up their plans; they also staggered us with their beauty. Those maps marked how battles played out and where campaigns went wrong. They recorded patterns of settlement and made wildly speculative claims to western lands. But we had to be careful about how we used them, because those maps reflected their makers’ point of view. Sometimes cartographers were working with bad information, and sometimes they intentionally misrepresented reality. “Maps at the time show the colonies extending well into the interior,” the scholar Maggie Blackhawk points out. “They’re aspirational, in many ways. They’re an argument rather than a conclusion.” To account for discrepancies in the cartographic record, we created more than 100 new maps for the series and spent years ensuring their accuracy. The challenges were many; far more than borders have been altered since 1775. Dams have redirected waterways, and rivers have changed course all on their own. Kaskaskia, Illinois, for instance, today lies on the western side of the Mississippi River, the opposite bank from where it stood when George Rogers Clark claimed it for the United States, in 1778. Coastal cities have spent the centuries reclaiming land by filling in marshes. A bird’s-eye view of 21st-century Boston does not much resemble one from the Revolutionary period , when the Back Bay was still a bay. Major arteries on the modern map, such as the Erie Canal, hadn’t yet been dug, so we had to erase them. Though we expected to have little to go on when recharting 18th-century eastern North America, old maps and other documentation gave us hundreds of places where people lived in 1775. But amassing those data from various sources and plotting them accurately on our new maps was a much bigger undertaking than we had imagined. North America changed rapidly in the second half of the 18th century as more people arrived from Europe or were taken forcibly from Africa and the settler population pushed farther into Indian Country. We hired the geographer Charles E. Frye, who scanned data from hundreds of archival maps and placed them over modern maps based on satellite imagery, correcting for changes in topography and hydrography, as well as the imprecision of the original mapmakers. Our resulting maps show North America as it was. The 13 colonies have no drawn western borders, reflecting ongoing boundary disputes and a moving line of settlement. Native nations across the continent, and especially those that shared a frontier with the early United States, are prominently marked, while Cherokee, Shawnee, Delaware, and Haudenosaunee towns have as visible a place as many settler towns in Pennsylvania, South Carolina, and Quebec. Lindsay Chervinsky: The ‘dirty and nasty people’ who became Americans At the time of the Revolution, “70–80 percent of the continent is still controlled by Indigenous people—politically, economically, and militarily,” the historian Michael Witgen notes. “It’s not a separate place. It’s not this timeless space where Native people are sort of existing in harmony with nature and that they have no interest in the outside world. Native people want the good stuff that Europeans are bringing. Europeans want the wealth that they can get from Native people. Native powers are as important to the global market economy as a place like Virginia or a place like New York.” “The small scale of our maps deceived us,” a Londoner wrote as the war entered its third year, “and, as the word ‘America’ takes up no more room than the word ‘Yorkshire,’ we seem to think the territories they represent are much of the same bigness, though Charleston is as far from Boston as London from Venice.” The Londoner drew an unwelcome conclusion: “We have undertaken a war against farmers and farmhouses, scattered through a wild waste of continent.” Armies carried their destruction across the former colonies, over the mountains to Cherokee and Haudenosaunee lands, onto the Great Lakes and the Ohio and Mississippi Rivers, south along the Gulf Coast, into Florida, and north to Canada. After France and later Spain and the Netherlands entered the war with Great Britain, navies brought it to the West Indies, Western Europe, the Mediterranean, even India. The American Revolution was a world war fought in the age of sail. Thousands of miles separated its theaters of action, and coordinating campaigns at that distance proved a nightmare. The post roads and sea lanes, typical avenues of communication in peacetime, were under constant threat during the war. Many letters were intercepted or lost. Even unimpeded transmissions could carry orders only as fast as the fastest horse or the quickest ship. It took weeks at best for the British high command in London to get news from North America, and their orders heading west, unaided by the Gulf Stream, took even longer. In 1775, people in England didn’t even know there was a war until 40 days after “the shot heard round the world.” In 1781, American and French armies had to walk hundreds of miles in the heat of summer to get from Westchester County, New York, to Yorktown, Virginia. “It’s hot and humid, and, as the French write, ‘infested by mosquitos,’ ” the historian Iris de Rode observes. “They have to create bridges. They have to get obstacles out of the way. And we’re not talking just about men marching. We have a lot of animals behind them. In order to not walk in the middle of the day, they start in the middle of the night. So it’s pitch-dark. You’re walking on little paths, probably quite muddy. And you just walk.” The North American landscape itself became a star of the series. We filmed for 165 days at more than 150 locations in and outside the original 13 colonies, in every season, at every time of day, and from every vantage. We often reduce the East Coast to the I-95 corridor and easily dismiss its natural beauty—particularly within the megalopolis of asphalt, concrete, and steel between the Potomac and Merrimack Rivers. It’s undeniable that we have paved over much of our past, but there’s still grandeur to see, and we tried to capture as much of it as we could with our cameras. Filming pine trees on Maine’s seacoast and palmettos off Charleston left us with stark reminders of North America’s botanical diversity as well as its vastness. The true protagonists of our series are, of course, the people who experienced the war, and we devoted much of our research to understanding the texture of their lives. There are oil-on-canvas portraits from the period, but they depict only a very small subset of society, people who had the time to sit for a painting and the means to pay for one. Because so few portraits were made, we can’t know what most people looked like. But there’s no shortage of first-person testimony from the Revolution. Even if someone’s likeness died with them, their writing may have survived. Several times throughout the series, we put handwriting on the screen as evidence that these lesser-known characters had been alive too. We pored over papers at historical societies, combed through old newspapers, exhausted museum catalogs. We got involved with online ancestry forums, stalked auction houses, cold-called collectors. Some of the portraits in our film are in private hands and haven’t been on public display in decades, including understandably rare portraits of Benedict Arnold, a figure shunned by postwar American artists. The central question was this: How could we understand the experiences of people who lived through our founding—not from our own perspective, but from theirs? “War in itself, however distant, is indeed terrible,” 16-year-old Betsy Ambler, of Yorktown, wrote when the British army invaded Virginia in 1781. “But when brought to our very doors—when those we most love are personally engaged in it, when our friends and neighbors are exposed to its ravages, when we know assuredly that without sacrificing many dear to us as our own lives, our country must remain subject to British tyrany—the reflection is indeed overwhelming.” We wanted the film to bring the audience closer to the reality of how North America felt and looked and sounded to the men, women, and children who waged and witnessed this war. These were real people, with real hopes and fears not so different from our own. Read: A view of American history that leads to one conclusion The commitment of reenactors and historical interpreters to this project was crucial. Their period-perfect, handsewn clothes are just the start. They have spent countless hours researching the lives of the people they give over their weekends to portraying. We were with reenactors on the battlefield, with blacksmiths at their forge, with weavers at their loom—anywhere our cameras could capture the scale of the war effort required to win independence. We worked with several reenactor groups throughout production, but the Jersey Greys most of all. They agreed to drill for us at night in a snowstorm, to march through deep mud, and to build what they believe to be the largest redoubt in North America, which gave us insight into how much work went into being a soldier. Thousands of civilians followed armies during the Revolution. The soldiers were willing to cook food or mend clothes, but laundry, we learned, was mostly women’s work. And clean clothes were a necessity, given the ever-present threat of disease. We filmed reenactors washing bloody garments, which is one of the very first shots in the first episode, and we return to that imagery at a key point in the series. “Imagine what a battlefield looks like after a battle,” the historian Kathleen DuVal says. “It has a lot of bodies. It has a lot of blood and gore. And it was the job of women to go in and take care of those bodies, to clean them up, to identify them, if they could, to see over the burial of bodies. Part of the work of war is dealing with death.” The bloody civil war at the heart of the Revolutionary story was far beyond what we had previously appreciated. “The United States came out of violence,” Maya Jasanoff observes. Those seven words ought to be self-evident; a war is a war, after all. And yet, welcoming that idea can shock the system because our popular conception of the American Revolution is so often encased in bloodless, gallant myth. The real Revolution was a savage civil war: eight years of uncertainty, brutality, and terror that tore communities apart and left tremendous loss in their aftermath. That doesn’t in any way diminish its inspiring outcome; it only underscores how much people were willing to sacrifice to create the United States. One of the most astonishing aspects of the Revolutionary War, the historian Christopher L. Brown says, “is that you had such different places come together as one nation. I’m not sure there is a state, anywhere in the world, in the late 18th century, that has as wide variety of people who inhabit it.” And so, the nation “ends up cohering, not around culture, not around religion, not around ancient history. It was coming together around a set of purposes and ideals for one common cause.” When the Revolution began, many American rebels had no intention of breaking with the British empire. They still wanted Parliament to leave them alone, to treat them with the same “salutary neglect” that had allowed previous generations of American colonists to flourish. Most of them still wanted to remain subjects of the British King. War would change that. To win, the Patriots would have to unite the colonies, declare American independence, promise more political participation to grow their coalition, secure French support, and ultimately create a government strong enough to function without jeopardizing individual rights and liberties. None of that was on the table from the start. The United States that emerged from the war was a nation no one could have imagined before the shooting began in April 1775. The war changed how Americans thought about themselves, their connections with one another, and their relationship to their government. Understanding that—understanding the circumstances under which the Declaration of Independence, the Constitution, and the Bill of Rights were created—only reinforces the vitality of those founding documents. By the end of the American Revolution, Betsy Ambler had lived for years as a refugee and lost her hometown forever. “The War,” she later remembered, “tho’ it was to involve my immediate family in poverty and perplexity of every kind was in the end to lay the foundation of independence and prosperity for my Country, and what sacrifice would not an American, a Virginian, at the earliest age have made for so desirable an end?” The American Revolution will air on PBS beginning November 16, 2025.

a88175ba5eae,The Myth of Mad King George,,"T hree miles south of Windsor Castle, in the western exurbs of London, stands a 25-ton equestrian statue of King George III, cast from old cannons in the decade after his death in 1820. Dressed as Marcus Aurelius, in toga and laurel crown, he sits astride his charger, regal and oversize, honored if not revered for a reign that lasted almost 60 years, from the creation of the first British empire in the Seven Years’ War through the final defeat of Napoleon. Explore the November 2025 Issue Check out more from this issue and find your next story to read. View More A similar statue of George as a mounted Roman emperor once stood in New York City atop a marble plinth on Bowling Green, at the lower tip of Manhattan. Commissioned by grateful American colonists following the 1766 repeal of the detested Stamp Act—intended by Parliament to raise money from the lightly taxed colonials—the august figure lasted less than a decade. In July 1776, inflamed by a public reading of the newly adopted Declaration of Independence, Continental Army soldiers and other vandals broke through the iron fence surrounding the statue, lassoed George with ropes, and tugged him to the ground—“levelled with ye dust,” as a witness reported. The mob decapitated the King and whacked off his nose. Musket balls punctured his torso, and looters scraped away the 10 ounces of gold leaf that coated rider and horse. The severed head, initially impaled on a spike outside a tavern, would be recovered by a British Army officer and shipped to England to illustrate the “Disposition of the Ungrateful people.” Rebels carted the headless rider and mount in fragments to Connecticut, where Patriot women melted the lead, ladled it into molds, and soon sent George Washington’s army 42,088 bullets. “It is hoped,” an American surgeon wrote in his journal, “that the Emanations of the Leaden George will make … deep impressions in the Bodies of some of his red Coated and Torie subjects.” George was that kind of king, inspiring both admiration and regicidal contempt. As the British monarch during the American Revolution, he has, for two and a half centuries, symbolized haughty intransigence and been portrayed as a reactionary dolt incapable of grasping the fervor for liberty that animated his American subjects. On Broadway, he minces through Hamilton as a foppish, sinister clown, singing to the estranged rebels, “You’ll be back” and adding, “I will kill your friends and family to remind you of my love.” In truth, the public opening by the British Crown of George III’s papers in the past decade reveals him to be a far more complex, accomplished, and even estimable figure than the prevailing caricature. He could also be ruthless, self-righteous, and so mulish that he threatened abdication unless his government maintained a hard line against American independence. The struggle with America, which he considered “the most serious in which any country was ever engaged,” was lost on his watch, at an estimated cost to his kingdom of £128 million, plus tens of thousands of British casualties and a reduction of the empire on which the sun supposedly never set by half a million square miles. Not long after the British defeat at Yorktown, Virginia, in October 1781 all but ended the war, George asked “that Posterity may not lay the downfall of this once respectable Empire at my door.” Yet posterity has indeed blamed him for what his biographer Andrew Roberts called “the colossal disaster, the worst in British history until the loss of India in 1947.” As bloodshed in America intensified following the initial gunplay at Lexington and Concord in 1775, George chose as his country seat Windsor, “a place I love best in the world.” In this redoubt, with its stout stone walls overlooking the Thames, away from the nattering courtiers and importunate government ministers in London, he could play the country squire with his growing family. A military band tootled martial airs every evening when the King was in residence, and in 1777 he personally designed the so-called Windsor uniform, a tunic of dark blue with red cuffs that George—his nation’s captain-general—wore as a costume of discipline and duty. He would spend the final 14 years of his life at Windsor. Here he would be buried, and here his papers were deposited in the Royal Archives. In the 10 years since they were made widely accessible through an initiative, approved by the late Queen Elizabeth II, to catalog and digitize this trove, historians and biographers have climbed the 102 stone steps and 21 wooden stairs to the garret of the Round Tower, begun by William the Conqueror in the 11th century. Here are the papers, several hundred thousand pages in gorgeous red binders. Many are written in George’s tidy, looping hand—he served as his own secretary, personally drafting most of his correspondence until late in life, when he began to go blind. Anyone thumbing through these pages gets not only a tactile feeling of being in his presence but also a vivid sense of who he was and why he chose to wage war against his own people for eight years across 3,000 miles of open ocean in the age of sail. George had ascended the throne in 1760, at the age of 22, England’s youngest king in more than two centuries. Unlike the two German-born Georges who preceded him—the House of Hanover had been offered the crown in 1714, when Britain was desperate for a Protestant monarch—this George was thoroughly English. “Born and Educated in this country,” he proclaimed, “I glory in the name of Britain.” A lonely, diffident prince—“silent, modest, and easily abashed,” as one courtier recorded—he had grown into a robust, confident king, with a regal bearing, ruddy cheeks, a high forehead balanced by a dimpled chin, and what were described as “extremely fine” teeth. One writer reported that he considered it effeminate to have a carpet in his bedroom, and he often took to his horse for a gallop early in the morning regardless of the weather. George was habitually moderate; a biographer describes him as a “good-mutton man” who preferred a jug of barley water to wine. Shrewd rather than brilliant, he was not easily duped, and he possessed what one duchess called “a wonderful way of knowing what is going forward.” His “unforgiving piety,” in the phrase of a contemporary, caused him to resist political concession and to impute moral deficiencies to his opponents. He disliked disorder and loathed disobedience. “My opinion is formed on principle, not on events,” he acknowledged, “and therefore is not open to change.” He saw himself as John Bull, the commonsensical embodiment of Great Britain, for which he should remain a moral exemplar—a thankless task, given his conviction that he lived in “the wickedest age that ever was seen.” A few guiding precepts shaped his reign. The monarch must shun Roman Catholicism and preserve the British constitution, enshrined in documents such as the Magna Carta and the Bill of Rights of 1689. His powers were far broader than those wielded by a British monarch today. But he could not rule by royal caprice; rather, he needed cooperation from his ministers and majorities in both houses of Parliament, restrictions that he embraced as a proper restraint on despotism. Not once would he exercise his right to veto a parliamentary bill, even those he opposed. He believed that maritime power and colonial policy should promote commerce, the bedrock of national prosperity. “I am born for the happiness or misery of a great nation,” he declared, “and consequently must often act contrary to my passions.” Good kingship also required that he produce an heir, and toward that end he recruited a spouse in Charlotte, a 17-year-old princess from a small German duchy. It was said, unkindly, that George winced the first time he saw his homely bride, but they married six hours after meeting, and the happy union proved fertile: She produced children with regularity, eventually to number 15, in sharp contrast to George’s French rival, Louis XVI, who consummated his marriage to the Austrian archduchess Marie-Antoinette seven years after they wed. Charlotte—“the Queen of my heart,” George called her—shared his religious zeal as well as his affection for Handel, country dances, and the theater. (For his part, he indulged her enthusiasm for dogs, jewelry, and snuff.) As an Enlightenment monarch, he promoted both arts and sciences, sponsoring the Royal Academy’s founding, in 1768, and building an observatory at Richmond Palace, where he personally took measurements of the transit of Venus across the sun, in 1769, to help gauge the size of the solar system. He played the flute, piano, harpsichord, and organ; wrote a treatise on crop rotation for Annals of Agriculture under the pseudonym “Ralph Robinson”; and copied out a recipe for cough syrup —rosemary, rue, vinegar, and brown sugar, all “boiled in silver.” Always intrigued by how things were made, from buttons and pins to canals and warships, George also collected 2,000 clocks, watches, chronometers, barometers, and other devices, some of which he disassembled. In his lifetime he amassed the 65,000 books that would form the core of the British Library. Today the so-called King’s Library is housed in a six-story glass tower that rises through the lobby of the British Library. The shelves hint at the breadth of George’s interests: a 1476 edition of Chaucer’s Canterbury Tales —reputedly one of the first books printed in England—as well as a dozen editions of Don Quixote in various languages, a 1759 treatise by Thomas Barnes titled A New Method of Propagating Fruit-Trees, and Flowering-Shrubs , and 200 versions of the Bible, including a 1455 Gutenberg. “He was an Enlightenment-type collector, in that he wanted to collect everything,” Karen Limper-Herz, the head of Printed Heritage Collections, told me. “Effectively, he was trying to collect his kingdom.” The 65,000 books amassed by King George III are today housed in a six-story glass tower at the British Library.

The collection includes An Account of the European Settlements in America , by Edmund Burke; The History of the British Dominions in North America , which started with their first discovery, by Sebastian Cabot, in 1497, and ended with the conclusion of the Seven Years’ War, in 1763; and 14,461 pamphlets, among them a 1776 edition of Common Sense , in which the polemicist Thomas Paine, who had recently emigrated from England to Philadelphia, denounced George as “the Royal Brute of Great Britain.” If habitually curious , George remained a homebody, never once visiting his dominions in Scotland, Wales, Ireland, or even northern England, much less Europe or America. Nonetheless, the wide world seemed to lie at his feet. Early in his reign, spoils won from France and Spain during the Seven Years’ War included Canada, Florida, several West Indian sugar islands, and an immense tract between the Appalachian Mountains and the Mississippi River. “Our bells are worn threadbare with ringing for victories,” one happy Briton reported. London became the center of the Western world, and Britain now possessed both the most powerful navy in history and a merchant fleet of some 8,000 vessels. The creation of this first British empire brought its own vexations. Weighted with war debts, the treasury spent half of the government’s annual tax revenue on interest payments. It seemed only fair to the King and his government that colonists should help shoulder the burden; a typical American, by Treasury Board calculations, paid no more than sixpence a year in Crown taxes—one-50th of the average Englishman’s payment—even as Americans benefited from the eradication of the French and Spanish threats and from the navy’s protection of North American trade. Yet Americans bridled at all attempts by Parliament to extract further revenue from them without the approval of their own provincial assemblies. For generations, a British policy of “salutary neglect” had left colonists accustomed to self-sufficient autonomy. They also resented British prohibitions against making hats, woolens, and other goods that might compete with manufacturers in the mother country. The deployment of British army regiments in America to keep white colonists from encroaching on Native lands to the west further aggrieved men such as George Washington and Benjamin Franklin, who saw opportunity and wealth just over the horizon. Almost imperceptibly, a quarrel over taxes and filial duty metastasized into a struggle over sovereignty. While rescinding earlier tax measures, including the Stamp Act, Parliament, with the King’s agreement, asserted its own fiscal authority by keeping a small residual tax on tea. Whooping insurrectionists, said to be “dressed in the Indian manner,” responded by dumping 45 tons of British tea into Boston Harbor in December 1773. The King’s heart hardened. Spurning pleas for moderation, he denounced “a dangerous spirit of resistance” among “my deluded subjects” in America, whom he likened to froward children. This resistance to Crown authority, with its sulfurous whiff of republicanism, threatened not only to undermine Parliament’s authority but also to bring moral disorder and the collapse of European hegemony in the New World. “Blows must decide,” George wrote of the colonists in November 1774, “whether they are to be subject to this country or independent.” He advocated “the most coercive measures.” From the February 1874 issue: Oliver Wendell Holmes’s poem ‘A Ballad of the Boston Tea-Party’ The blows began to fall, first at Lexington and Concord in April 1775, then at Bunker Hill in June. By August, George had declared the colonies —“misled by dangerous and ill-designing men”—to be in “open and avowed Rebellion.” Anyone abetting the rebel cause was deemed a traitor. To his prime minister, Frederick Lord North, he wrote in October 1775 , “Every means of distressing America must meet with my concurrence.” Some Britons opposed the eventual deployment to America of almost two-thirds of the British army and much of the Royal Navy. William Pitt, the Earl of Chatham, who had orchestrated Britain’s victory in the Seven Years’ War, was incensed. “You cannot conquer America,” he told the House of Lords. “If I were an American, as I am an Englishman, while a foreign troop was landed in my country, I would never lay down my arms, never — never — never!” But Parliament year after year supported the King’s hard line. Certain strategic misconceptions, however, had seeped into British war policy. The presumption that military firepower would deter the other 12 colonies from following Massachusetts into armed rebellion proved wrong; bloodshed at Lexington and on other battlefields inflamed rebels from Georgia to New Hampshire. The King and his ministers, encouraged by senior British generals and self-serving Loyalist functionaries, also insisted that a majority of the 2 million white Americans remained at least tacitly loyal to the Crown. Yet that, too, was delusional. Modern scholarship suggests that Loyalists constituted perhaps 20 percent of the colonial population, never sufficient to control the levers of power—the Second Continental Congress and state governments—or to prove decisive in combat, despite the thousands of armed Loyalists who transformed the Revolution into a civil war. Perhaps most wrongheaded was the conviction, embraced as an article of faith by the King throughout the war, that failure to reassert London’s authority would eventually unstitch the empire by encouraging insurrections in Ireland, Canada, the Caribbean, and India. Dominoes would topple. Conceding independence to America would plunge Britain into “a state of inferiority,” as George wrote to Lord North, and “into a very low class among the European states.” He added, “I hope never to live to see that day.” Unlike most of the English monarchs who preceded him, George lacked military experience, although he had long considered the army “to be his own department,” one adviser reported. He threw himself into the details of expeditionary warfare: the choice of field commanders, the use of secret codes, the decision about whether seagoing colliers should be converted into men-of-war. As the fighting intensified in America, he reviewed not only government correspondence to and from his generals but also intelligence reports, paymaster instructions, and commissary dispatches. He was consulted about the shipment of salt and candles across the Atlantic and about whether an amphibious expedition should strike North Carolina. He weighed in on which widows and orphans of redcoats killed in Boston should receive pensions, and whether American prisoners ought to be transported to India, where British territories were short of white settlers. He visited his troops in military camps and drafted detailed lists: of “Ships Building and Repairing” and “Oak Timber in Store” at various dockyards; of the commanders of his cavalry units; and of royal ships “in Ordinary”—the reserve fleet—including the number of guns each mounted. George’s extensive library of military texts and books about America included Establishments of His Majesty’s Land Forces and Garrisons (1778), a volume bound in red morocco, with every British regiment recorded in wispy threads of black ink, along with its size, per diem allotments for officers, and other statistics. A List of Your Majesty’s Royal Navy , also in red morocco, informed the King across more than 100 pages that he commanded 125 ships of the line—each carrying 60 guns or more—plus 270 frigates and lesser craft, down to sloops, cutters, and hoys. Those vessels would collectively be manned by 45,000 sailors in 1777. In addition to a first edition of Paradise Lost and a two-volume 1775 treatise titled American Husbandry , the King amassed tens of thousands of maps, allowing him to study his realm from an armchair. Those included exquisite battle maps of various British clashes against the American rebels, in Boston, Brandywine, Germantown, Charleston, and, ultimately, Yorktown. A particularly poignant map, annotated in 1783, depicts “the boundary of the new republic of the United States.” The King’s Library, one scholar wrote, provided “a retreat and even a solace for a monarch of retiring disposition whose long life was punctuated by bitter political acrimony.” A Hessian mercenary’s watercolor depiction of a fellow German soldier (EMU History / Alamy) George also took the lead in hiring auxiliary troops in Germany, which he insisted could be had “at a much cheaper rate, besides more expeditiously than if raised at home.” In seeking such mercenaries to bolster his British legions, he dictated the deal points for pay rates, transportation arrangements from Europe to America, and the war materiel to be provided. On his orders, the British colonel negotiating with various German princelings was told, “Get as many men as you can,” because “the King is extremely anxious.” Eventually some 30,000 “Hessians”—as all German troops were called, regardless of their specific origins—would battle the rebels. At first those rebels had avoided accusing the King of complicity in prosecuting the war, preferring the fiction that only his hard-line ministers and other bellicose Britons were at fault. That discretion ended with the publication of Paine’s scathing Common Sense , which excoriated George and repudiated monarchy in general. Soon enough, his portrait was burned throughout the colonies; the royal arms vanished from American street signs and buildings; and he was subject to mock trials, executions, and funerals, a contempt that wounded him personally. The Declaration of Independence listed what Samuel Adams called George’s “Catalogue of Crimes,” a hyperbolic, 16-sentence indictment that charged him with tyranny, turpitude, and bad faith. Down came that gilded statue on Bowling Green in New York. So much about this war baffled George, including how his reign had become entangled in a squalid brawl in the empire’s most distant marchlands. Crushing the insurgency proved far more vexatious than the King and his men had anticipated. Paine pressed the point in an open letter to the British published in 1777 . “In all the wars which you have formerly been concerned in, you had only armies to contend with,” he wrote. “In this case, you have both an army and a country to combat.” British officers deftly adapted European combat tactics to American terrain by stressing mobility, extended battle lines, and uniforms better suited to woodland fighting. But frictions beset the King’s cause. Senior commanders feuded with one another and with their political masters at home. Penny-pinching prevented a timely expansion of the Royal Navy and full mobilization of the army early in the war. An inept British supply system splintered responsibility for transporting troops and supplies across the Atlantic among the Ordnance Board, the Navy Board, the Victualling Board, and the Treasury, depending on whether the cargo to be shipped was a gun, a man, a horse, camp equipage, food, or other war necessities. The King and his men continued to misjudge the American temperament, both in the broad, visionary commitment to a republican future and in the seething resentments that fueled the insurrection—not least from Britain’s incineration of more than half a dozen American towns. After General Washington’s successful surprise attack on the Hessian garrison at Trenton on Christmas night 1776, Lord George Germain, who directed the war from London as the American secretary, told his emissaries he hoped “that the unexpected success of the Rebels there will not so far elate them as to prevent them from seeing the real horrors of their situation.” Months later, the last remnants of an Anglo-German army of 8,000 men, who had invaded New York from Canada, surrendered at Saratoga on the Hudson River—a “most fatal event,” in the judgment of Prime Minister North. Unbowed, the King declared the calamity “very serious but not without remedy.” Yet soon the French would come into the war against Britain, to be followed by the Spanish and eventually the Dutch. Britain remained all but friendless, as the kingdom had been since 1763, with only tiny Portugal as a putative ally. Parliament sought a way out by renouncing its authority to tax the Americans and appointing a peace commission empowered to offer other concessions. But granting full independence to the rebels remained nonnegotiable. George refused “to enter into what I look upon as the destruction of the empire.” Lord North, miserable and overmatched as a wartime prime minister, pleaded a dozen times to resign, but the King balked at releasing his most trusted courtier. “Recruit your mind,” he urged North. To the Earl of Sandwich, he declared, “If others will not be active, I must drive.” Drive he did. Always stalwart in the face of peril, George rallied the nation when a huge Franco-Spanish invasion fleet appeared off England’s southern coast in August 1779. Soon enough the armada sailed away, beset by sickness, poor seamanship, and confusion, without a single enemy soldier setting foot on English soil or the opposing fleets exchanging salvos. Yet victory remained out of grasp. Even a British military triumph was unlikely to yield an enduring political solution, given the animosity aroused by years of killing and the prodigious expansion of the American colonies, which were doubling in population every quarter century, an explosive growth unseen in recorded European history and four times England’s rate. With the surrender of another British army at Yorktown in October 1781, the war was all but over, although another two years would be needed to negotiate the peace treaties. The House of Commons had delivered a stunning rebuke to the King by resolving that “the influence of the Crown has increased, is increasing, and ought to be diminished.” George contemplated giving up the throne, and in March 1783 drafted an abdication announcement, “a self-indulgent and characteristically self-pitying private expostulation written to make himself feel better,” Roberts, the biographer, would write. George set aside the speech undelivered, to be discovered in his papers. As the King later admitted to John Adams, the first minister to the Court of St. James’s from the newly independent United States of America, “I was the last to consent to the Seperation.” The American artist William Walcutt’s 1857 painting of the toppling of the King George III statue (Bettmann / Getty) Such obstinacy would define his legacy for centuries to come. Failing to recognize the wide gap that had developed between Britain and the colonies, he could not understand the primal American yen for autonomy or the grievances accumulating across the Atlantic. Perhaps only great wisdom and a knack for compromise could have averted the violent rupture of 1775, but George possessed neither virtue. His life still had almost 40 years to run after the American Revolution, a span replete with glory—including Napoleon’s crushing defeat at Waterloo—but also abject misery. As a young king, George had been briefly afflicted by a mysterious illness once thought to be porphyria, a rare blood disorder that can ravage the nervous system. In October 1788, when he was 50, the malady returned with intensity, perhaps, one physician speculated, as a result of reading King Lear . Over the course of several months, he grew erratic, delirious, and “so ungovernable,” an aide wrote , “that recourse was had to the strait waistcoat: His legs were tied, & he was secured down across his Breast.” A phalanx of doctors also used such dubious treatments as leeches applied to the temples and blistering of the head and feet. The attacks abruptly ended, but returned with redoubled fury for several months in 1804, to again be treated with the straitjacket. From the May 1876 issue: The madness of George III This “madness,” as the behavior would be labeled in a 20th-century stage play and film, is now believed to have been “mania, a severe version of what we now label ‘bipolar disorder,’ ” according to Sir Simon Wessely, a former president of the Royal College of Psychiatrists. Perhaps triggered by the death of George’s youngest child, Princess Amelia, in 1810, the manic agitation recurred, this time lasting the remainder of his years. With the King incapacitated, his eldest son, George, the Prince of Wales, acted in his stead under the Regency Act of 1811. George soon descended into abject dementia and no longer recognized his family. Queen Charlotte saw him briefly at Windsor for the last time in June 1812, then never visited again. Blind and partially deaf, he grew a long white beard and played the harpsichord despite being unable to hear the notes. He died of pneumonia in 1820 at age 81, after 59 years on the throne, but without ever meeting the granddaughter who had been born a few months earlier to Prince Edward, his fourth son. That child, named Victoria, would take the crown in 1837, then rule for more than six decades and preside over the rise of a second British empire. As for that equestrian statue of George on Bowling Green: The whereabouts of the head are unknown—it disappeared shortly after it was shipped to England. All that remains of the rider and horse are a few fragments, including the mount’s tail, displayed by museums in New York and Philadelphia, plus a few unearthed musket balls with the same chemical signature as the original lead statue.

d0a1671eb168,Dear James: I’m Tired of the Religious Platitudes,,"Editor’s Note: Is anything ailing, torturing, or nagging at you? Are you beset by existential worries? Every Tuesday, James Parker tackles readers’ questions. Tell him about your lifelong or in-the-moment problems at [email protected] . Don’t want to miss a single column? Sign up to get “Dear James” in your inbox. Dear James, Am I a bad person for being weary of people talking about God as if everyone else in the conversation believes in their particular deity? I’m thinking of declarations such as “God moves in mysterious ways,” and “God has a plan for all of us,” and the countless other religious platitudes that people trot out. As an atheist, I certainly don’t assume that everyone I’m speaking with shares my nonbelief. When someone asks why something particular happened to them, for instance, I don’t say, “Everything that happens to us is a consequence of a combination of factors and decisions that are sometimes in our control and sometimes not.” And I don’t do it because I know it would probably be considered rude. Why don’t religious people make similar allowances for nonbelievers? It really gets to me, and I feel guilty about it—or maybe not guilty, but as if I’m being ungracious or petty. Dear Reader, I quite agree: Cloudy talk about plans and mysteries and the winding ways of Providence can be rather irritating. Especially right now, when most of whatever happens next would seem to be determined by arbitrary and despotic centers of earthly power. And in Christianity, as far as I can tell, no one has been able to come up with an answer to the problem of suffering that wasn’t at best kind of a cop-out (“God allows evils to happen,” Thomas Aquinas suggested, “in order to bring a greater good therefrom”) and at worst an insult to the intellect. If I sound a bit vinegary, a bit Hitchens-y , I’m really not. Ever since I realized that I wasn’t actually alone in the universe (it happened at a show by a band of Swiss avant-metalheads in London), I’ve believed in God. Believed, that is, in something that precedes me infinitely and also—most bizarrely—loves me. So I go to church, and I’m at home in the God talk. Do I believe in a divine plan, everything for the best, and so on? Not exactly. My nervous system does not seem to subscribe to that theory. But I do believe in divine trickery, active cosmic irony, and humanity’s bottomless capacity for missing the point completely. “Everyone has an anthropology,” wrote Walker Percy, meaning that everyone has at some level their own science of man, and of man’s relationship (or not) to God. “There is no not having one. If a man says he does not, all he is saying is that his anthropology is implicit, a set of assumptions which he has not thought to call into question.” You have questioned the assumptions. You have thought your anthropology through, and now you find it colliding with the perhaps less thought-through and more implicit anthropologies around you. I recommend generosity: These vague phrasings are just the sound of people trying to get through the moment, trying to make sense of things. Endeavor to not be annoyed. Every idea gets tested in the end, just as everyone comes to their own (eventual) reckoning.

ea9f3d28f4f0,SNLIs Reading the Room,,"The moment Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth began berating the military officials assembled at Marine Corps Base Quantico last week, he set Saturday Night Live up for an alley-oop. With his clenched fists, hot temper, and stars-and-stripes pocket square, the former Fox News host—as SNL was eager to point out at the top of its 51st-season premiere—did enough self-parody that Colin Jost didn’t have to add much to nail his take on Hegseth. Jost simply ratcheted up the volume and the attacks on soldiers’ physiques. With its cold open, the sketch series pulled off one of its most consistent tricks : identify an absurdity emanating from the political establishment, make the party responsible say the quiet part out loud, and wait for the headlines and social-media posts to roll in. But if the show’s send-up of Hegseth established that there are still moments in the broader culture that can get everyone talking about the same thing, the rest of the episode argued the opposite. The sketch that earned the most live hooting and hollering was not the politically topical one, but the pop-culturally zeitgeisty one—about a very particular movie that surprised many with its wild success this summer. In an episode featuring a pair of established Top 40 hitmakers—host Bad Bunny and musical guest Doja Cat—the real-life stars of the animated Netflix film KPop Demon Hunters stole the spotlight. And they underscored SNL ’s clear desire to keep up with the shifting center of the pop-culture universe. The women of HUNTR/X, the fictional pop trio that leads the sleeper hit, provided the kicker to a sketch that poked fun at what it’s like to be on the inside (and outside) of a huge cultural phenomenon. Bad Bunny is the lone KPop Demon Hunters –obsessed member of his friend group, played by Mikey Day, Chloe Fineman, and Sarah Sherman. His affection for the children’s movie—in which a pop song is all that stands between humanity and a demonic apocalypse—comes as a surprise to them: He has no kids, so this is something he cued up on Netflix all by himself; he’s so familiar with the soundtrack that when Fineman’s character suggests they shift the conversation to a different topic, he goes right into daydreaming about HUNTR/X singing its Billboard No. 1 hit, “Golden.” In the mind of Bad Bunny’s progressively more frustrated Hunters lover, nothing is as important or relevant as the animated pop stars’ tussle with the soul-sucking minions of Gwi-Ma. It all sounds perfectly silly coming out of a grown man’s mouth, and the film’s taxonomy of magical entities really gives Bad Bunny a run for his cue-card-reading money. But the enthusiastic crowd seemed to find much of the lingo legible, and many of the folks at home could likely follow along too—whether they’re parents or not. According to Netflix’s internal data, KPop Demon Hunters is the most popular English-language original in the company’s history. It is also, in a rarity for a streaming movie , a merchandise-generating, box-office-topping sensation, reminiscent of a time when a handful of popular movies could make for reliable watercooler fodder. Returning from its summer hiatus, SNL had plenty of other blockbusters to base sketches on: reimaginings of Superman and The Fantastic Four , even the idiosyncratic horror-comedy film Weapons . That it tried to make a splash with HUNTR/X shows where the SNL team sees the most cultural heat coming from—and demonstrates that it has a little more savvy than the movie studio that initially handed off KPop Demon Hunters to Netflix in the first place. Read: The one big change SNL is making SNL ’s ability to synthesize a broad spectrum of pop culture into sketch comedy has always been key to its endurance. But it’s notable that the show’s interests have widened to encompass an anime-inspired streaming cartoon about supernaturally powered Korean pop idols. The sketch also emphasized how much of the SNL ’s frame of reference originates in virtual spaces, a tendency also glimpsed in the taboo-testing “Weekend Update” debut of Kam Patterson, who repeatedly prodded Jost to let him use the N-word. A favorite of the button-pushing podcast Kill Tony , Patterson at one point said that “the people on the internet would disagree” that he brings more to the show than provocation. And the first person viewers saw on-screen this week was Patterson’s fellow newcomer Jeremy Culhane—a fresh face to those who have never encountered social-media clips of his impish appearances on the niche comedy streamer Dropout. Monoculture has always been something of a myth, a faint collective memory of a society with fewer avenues to, as Sherman put it in the KPop Demon Hunters sketch, “experience any culture.” Survey a large enough cross section of last night’s SNL viewership, and you might find that the number of viewers who saw their tastes reflected in the episode’s Jeopardy parody is roughly equal to those who recognized the comic stylings of the legendary Mexican comedian known as Chespirito; an homage to his massively popular sitcom, El Chavo , closed the night. The KPop Demon Hunters sketch ultimately argued that for all of the movie’s peculiarities—the weaponized music, the demonic lore—it’s a classic crowd-pleaser at its core. The songs are bangers, the visuals are bright and engaging, and the women of HUNTR/X are every bit the superheroes that Superman and the Fantastic Four are. And for some members of the SNL audience, these pop stars are news makers on par with, if not exceeding, the self-styled “secretary of war.”",https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/2025/10/snl-season-51-premiere-pete-hegseth-kpop-demon-hunters/684461,Culture,BBC,Erik Adams,https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/4q2Wv_hEWjkq70bY-mZusDZs9Yo=/0x147:1999x1188/1200x625/media/img/mt/2025/10/GettyImages_2238978405/original.png,2025-10-05T19:46:52+00:00,f29c83b0c0cda4ad1c5946734f90eb538af45b93
10573b59a602,The Publishing Industry’s Most Swoon-Worthy Genre,,"T he meet-cute took place in a bookstore. Around the middle of 2019, Elizabeth Held was hunting for great vacation reads at her local independent bookseller, East City Bookshop, a small store tucked below street level in Washington, D.C.’s Capitol Hill neighborhood. At checkout, Destinee Hodge, a longtime employee of the shop, told Held, a regular, that she was planning to start a book club where people could get together and swoon over romance novels. Held said she’d definitely be there. She was almost out the door when she spun around and told Hodge what she really wanted: to be a co-host of the new club. Hodge gave an enthusiastic yes, and they’ve been paired up ever since. Some people might balk at a near stranger’s sudden offer to jump on their idea. But it seemed to Held that Hodge didn’t mind; in fact, she was eager to collaborate with someone who valued the genre as much as she did. Her quick agreement is typical of the tight-knit but open-armed community that surrounds romance writing. The pair’s book club, Really Reading Romance, has thrived since it started (even during COVID, when it went remote). The year after their fateful encounter, Held also began writing a weekly romance-recommendation newsletter that now has more than 9,000 subscribers. Held estimates that she reads something like a book a week. Held may seem to be an outlier at a time when, according to an NPR/Ipsos poll from earlier this year, only 51 percent of Americans had read a book in the past month. But there are millions of people who are just like Held; an industry survey found that nearly half of contemporary fans of romance fiction also read at least a book a week. As demonstrated by the piles of spines that crowd the frames of TikToks where readers and influencers show off what they’re working through, plenty of people read even more. Romance readers have been voracious for decades, making the category a long-term profit engine for publishers, with a reputation for being “ recession-proof .” But in recent years, this genre has dominated the industry. Coming out of the pandemic, romance print-book sales more than double d from 2020 to 2023. In 2024, despite declining sales in other publishing categories, romance fans bought so many books that they helped push total print-book sales into the black. The market’s growth owes a great deal to what happens in bookstores like Hodge’s—and far beyond them. Thanks in large part to the internet and social media, this demographic has become loud, unignorable, and—for many booksellers and publishers in other literary niches—enviable. Some of the most devoted members of this fan base call their community “Romancelandia.” They are driving the genre into the mainstream by adapting to new platforms; organizing book clubs, podcasts, and meetups; and devouring novels and series as quickly as they’re released. The rest of the industry wants to emulate this success, but as many editors know, chasing a trend can be a futile endeavor. Romancelandia’s social world, harnessed by its business-minded authors, may make its success exceedingly difficult to replicate. Read: Don’t call them trash Romance’s first advantage is its flexibility. The category is not a monolith but a broad network of interlinked subgenres, which rise and fall in popularity as readers’ tastes shift. Right now “romantasy” is huge, and “sports romances” are in. “Historicals” are on the wane; “dark romance,” potentially on the rise. These changes are often cyclical, and the big subcategories eventually come back around: “About every 10 to 15 years we have a vampire surge,” Christine M. Larson, the author of Love in the Time of Self-Publishin g , a multidecade history of the romance ecosystem, told me. Tying the genre together are its clear and expected plot beats—and, of course, marketing. But because the category is so broad, a romance novel can be any novel that proudly calls itself a romance. Another important strength of the category may look at first like a contradiction. Despite its long-standing economic success, the genre—and the culture around it—retains the status of a defiant outsider. Since modern romance developed in the 1970s, these novels have been thoroughly ignored by highbrow critics and prestigious-award juries. But such exclusion may have helped their readers—and more importantly their writers and publishers—evolve into a cohort that Larson labels an “open-elite network.” In open-elite communities, as defined by Larson, more established members help less experienced ones, resulting in an environment of information sharing and mutual support. Larson said these underestimated groups of experts and newcomers can rapidly adapt to changing conditions, learning from one another’s strategies and growing together. She cites Silicon Valley as an example of an open-elite network—one in which a small group of collaborators operating outside the mainstream transformed their industry. In the case of romance, professional associations such as Romance Writers of America, founded in 1980, brought writers with unsold manuscripts into contact with titans of the genre. The internet allowed writers to riff on one another’s tropes and discuss new ideas for books, and it supercharged the idea that every interaction can be a marketing opportunity. Years before publishers were tracking follower counts, romance writers were watching their platforms grow. And now, in its maturity, Romancelandia retains the features that served it so well as an underdog. Successful romance authors have kept saying yes, for instance, to Hodge and Held’s book club in D.C. At a moment when traditional publications are scuttling book reviews and the economic barriers to entry for emerging writers are harder and harder to overcome, these habits are more useful than ever. In part because of their self-perceived outsider status, romance authors frequently see themselves as businesspeople as well as artists, responsible for their own survival and financial future. In contrast with fans of other genres who expect stars to drop a thick new novel every half decade or so, romance readers expect their favorite authors to publish fast and frequently, and writers are typically happy to oblige. Sarah MacLean, the New York Times best-selling author of romances including Nine Rules to Break When Romancing a Rake , has published 18 books in slightly more than 15 years. “‘We will publish as fast as you can write’ was sort of the sense,” MacLean told me about her first deal, for three books, with HarperCollins. Read: Five books in which romance sneaks up on you With its baked-in entrepreneurial streak, Romancelandia has long been open to new technologies. When Amazon launched Kindle Direct Publishing in 2007, romance writers lined up to get their work straight to readers. Self-publishing especially benefited romance writers. According to Larson’s book, from 2009 to 2014, romance authors’ median income from books increased by 73 percent. And today, editors at traditional publishing houses offer deals for future work to romance novelists who have already found success independently—perhaps on Kindle’s platform or through writing popular fanfiction. The model is analogous to those of tech start-ups: Writers bootstrap their first book or two, then hope a company with more money will call them up to the big leagues—if, that is, they can prove significant author-market fit. The collaborative, open-elite dynamic thrives on social media. Romances were some of the earliest successes to emerge from TikTok’s landscape of book-review videos, known as BookTok. The genre’s intense emotional valence happens to be a perfect match for the video platform, where many videos are filmed as direct, first-person addresses. Although social media has its great share of manufactured viral moments, the enthusiasm that launched authors such as Colleen Hoover onto best-seller lists reflects genuine fan passion. Leigh Stein, an author and book coach who teaches courses on TikTok and online strategy, specifically mentioned Hoover’s Facebook fan club, where she interacts with readers: She “doesn’t act above her audience, even though she’s a very wealthy woman now,” Stein told me. “That’s part of her popularity.” Authors connect with readers through social posts, book clubs like Held’s, and podcasts including one hosted by MacLean. This isn’t entirely unique to romance—science fiction and young-adult fiction have intimate, well-established readerships, for instance. But Romancelandia in particular prides itself on being a community of equals. That’s not to say that all the authors truly are on the same level—or that their social world is always harmonious. In 2019, a controversy sparked by allegations of racism against the Romance Writers of America’s board of directors led to its membership dropping calamitously; the group, previously one of the largest writers’ associations in the country, later filed for bankruptcy. Fans continue to point out that on algorithmic platforms such as TikTok, stories about straight white people falling in love are promoted above all others, and the community is also rife with plagiarism accusations. Traditional publishing is notoriously slow to shift its practices to meet the times. (Consider how long it took to develop ebooks and secure audio rights.) Popular imprints such as Berkley and Dell already publish plenty of romance novels. But less genre-inclined editors are taking notes too. Susan Swinwood, the editorial director at Mira Books, an arm of Harlequin, told me she’s noticed editors in other categories looking to snap up work that comes with a built-in audience, such as cookbooks from Instagram influencers and nonfiction from subject-matter experts with online followers, just as romance editors have been doing for years. Read: Seven books that capture how love really feels Some publishers are eager to emulate not only the marketing techniques of the genre, but also its tropes and its predominant emotional registers: joy and hope. “I’ve come to really value anyone who can make me laugh as much as they can make me cry,” Jesse Shuman, an editor at Ballantine who works with books across literary- and upmarket-fiction categories, told me (he’s also Stein’s editor). Cleyvis Natera, a literary novelist, turns to the genre for craft elements. “Everyone is expected to read literary fiction, because it’s instructive. And I think romance is instructive in that same way,” Natera told me. “How do we keep the attention of our readers, and how do we build loyalty?” Stein said her new book, a literary novel about a TikTok hype house , went into a second printing before it was even published—possibly thanks to the approaches she’s learned from romance. But the alchemy that makes Romancelandia work (and makes its authors a real living) may prove to be unrepeatable outside this particular community, whose members gather for reasons far beyond mutual commercial support. MacLean keeps podcasting, which allows her to connect with fans and other authors even as her books hit best-seller lists. More established authors keep offering a helping hand to newbies. “People are surprisingly open to reading work and blurbing work by an author that they have no connection to,” Maggie Cooper, a literary agent who represents writers across categories, told me. Held keeps running the Really Reading Romance book club because it’s a bright spot of creativity and community in her life and the lives of others. And in a turn that’s quite common for the romance world, she’s making the transition from reader to writer: She is now working on a nonfiction book about romance novels. ​​When you buy a book using a link on this page, we receive a commission.

d15192f3d0dc,Taylor Swift’s Fairy Tale Is Over,,"She doesn’t sound like she’s having fun. She has the team captain , the cushion-cut diamond , the fans who will shell out for yet another branded cardigan—but Taylor Swift’s The Life of a Showgirl , and the life it seems to portray, is a charmless chore. Swift spends her 12th album pondering familiar bummers: rivalries, regrets, the countdown clock of her own mortality. What’s new, narratively , is her football-player fiancé and the happily ever after he represents. But she can’t quite convince herself, or the listener, that she’s getting what she’s always said she wants. She’s become too cynical to sell a fairy tale. Theoretically this is an interesting place for Swift, that ever-striving Sagittarius, to be: at the end of a checklist of goals and still unsatisfied. Her economies-quaking Eras Tour flaunted the power earned by years of hard work; her engagement to Travis Kelce appeared to fulfill the romantic quest she has long sung about . Success certainly puts her under no obligation to fake a smile and hide her anxieties. Unfortunately, Showgirl is the sound of an overworked and overexposed entertainer reaching the mountaintop to find something worse than disappointment: burnout. From the moment it was announced in August, Showgirl was sold as a bedazzled return to pure pop. Swift recorded it on tour, using free days to fly to Sweden to work with the legendary producer Max Martin and his collaborator Shellback. Their methods—ruthless melodic math , brazenly artificial production, and an odd soft spot for reggae rhythms—helped define the world-conquering sound of Britney Spears and Backstreet Boys. When Martin first teamed up with Swift for 2012’s Red , their partnership propelled her from country-music fame into the echelon of megastardom where she still resides. Ever since 2019’s Lover , though, she’s preferred to work with indie-rock dudes (chiefly Jack Antonoff ) who draw out her arty side. Her fascinating but unwieldy 2024 release, The Tortured Poets Department , seemed to push that phase of her career as far as it could go . That album prioritized emotional and narrative complexity over catchy sing-alongs. Showgirl , she said on her fiancé’s podcast, is a return to “melodies that are so infectious that you’re almost angry at it, and lyrics that are just as vivid but crisp and focused and completely intentional.” The album sometimes does fit that description—especially on the relatively strong, if unexpectedly downcast, opening three songs. “The Fate of Ophelia” pairs delicate snares with an indelicate bass line as Swift raids Shakespeare to find a synonym for damsel in distress . Next, “Elizabeth Taylor” layers reverberating refrains for a smoldering, cinematic effect. (It has some solid scene-setting, too: “We hit the best booth at Musso & Frank’s / They say I’m bad news; I just say, ‘Thanks.’”) “Opalite” is an inspirational vocabulary lesson whose chorus is delivered with ’80s-rock pep worthy of Richard Simmons. But the difference between effective and great pop is the ingredients missing here: novelty and passion. Swift and Martin’s previous highlights ambushed the ear with dubstep that crashed into country (“I Knew You Were Trouble”), satirical boom-bap (“Blank Space”), and industrial-R&B chaos ( Reputation ). A molten emotional core—an oh-so-Swedish mixture of glee and gloom—energized the exploration. Showgirl , however, sounds freeze-dried, prepacked, obvious. Though the album’s genres are superficially diverse—you’ll hear flashes of grunge, trap, and, yes, reggae—its arrangements could work fine as royalty-free background music for content creators. The Martin/Swift touchstone that’s most often recalled is the most simplistic one: “Bad Blood,” with its jock-jam drumbeat telling, not showing, the listener that they’re having fun. Read: The tortured poet of love gets engaged Swift’s songwriting isn’t pushing ahead either. Old tricks abound: perspectives switching between verses; high harmonies adding drama to a song’s final chorus. Lyrically, she tends to restate familiar themes in crasser terms than ever before. The ballad “Eldest Daughter” describes internet toxicity in the same way as an anti-bullying PSA: “Every joke’s just trolling and memes / Sad as it seems, apathy is hot.” And yet she’s very much the troll on “Actually Romantic,” which disses another singer with as much sophistication as “I am rubber, you are glue.” “Wood” salutes her man’s anatomy in a similarly third-grade manner. Album after album, she’s inched toward more explicit sex talk, but lines like “His love was the key that opened my thighs” are so uninspired—neither funny nor specific nor even memorably gross—that they feel nihilistic. The most interesting thing about Showgirl is the way Swift cops to the all-too-palpable sense that she’s finding it hard to care about anything. “Honey” is a successful bit of self-therapy about why she’s weary of pet names. The George Michael–quoting “Father Figure” seems to revisit the hoary fable of her publishing rights in order to portray her as a cruel mob boss. On “Opalite” and “Elizabeth Taylor,” she tries to reconcile her excitement over a new relationship with her many, many memories of heartbreak. The cover of the album—Swift glaring in what might be a post-concert ice bath—suits the hardened persona she presents here. And the music’s blend of moodiness and poppiness calls to mind 2022’s Midnights , which had more staying power than it initially appeared to possess. But that album was barbed with intrigue; it captured a journey inward, as Swift tried to figure out the source of her restlessness during a seemingly settled moment in her life. Showgirl , by contrast, doesn’t raise or answer questions. Well, other than: What’s the point of releasing an album whose music seems so exhausted and on guard? Likely answers include money, obligation, and strategy. Charitably, she really needs us to know how enervating her past few years were. On “Wi$h Li$t,” she fantasizes about having kids and being left alone, and Showgirl leaves no mystery as to why she’d want to disappear. She does perform one unvarnished act of creative generosity with the title track, which closes the album. On it, Sabrina Carpenter —Swift’s favored protégé—lends a vocal performance whose warmth and playfulness cut like a beam through fog, offering a reminder of how pop is supposed to make you feel. Swift clearly doesn’t want to play the ever-grinning showgirl anymore. That’s valid, but so is the impulse to listen to anything else.",https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/2025/10/taylor-swift-the-life-of-a-showgirl-album-review/684444,Culture,BBC,Spencer Kornhaber,https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/DU376x2Y-c0HLKYElQ6sSREDcr4=/0x10:4087x2139/1200x625/media/img/mt/2025/10/2025_10_03_Taylor_Swift_Album_Review_/original.jpg,2025-10-03T14:43:49+00:00,e9fadb234c78ab93b4b6afdc639871ca7ffb710b
