3b1226e41fce,Trump says he may send Ukraine long-range Tomahawk missiles if Russia continues conflict,"donald trump news, long-range missiles, russia, tomahawk missiles, ukraine, politics","ABOARD AIR FORCE ONE (AP) — President Donald Trump on Sunday warned Russia that he may send Ukraine long-range Tomahawk missiles if Moscow doesn’t settle its war there soon — suggesting that he could be ready to increase the pressure on Vladimir Putin’s government using a key weapons system. “I might say, ’Look: if this war is not going to get settled, I’m going to send them Tomahawks,” Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One as he flew to Israel. “The Tomahawk is an incredible weapon, very offensive weapon. And honestly, Russia does not need that.” Trump said, “I might tell them that if the war is not settled — that we may very well.” He added, “We may not, but we may do it. I think it’s appropriate to bring up.” READ MORE: Russia targets Ukraine’s power grid as Moscow expresses ‘extreme concern’ over U.S. weapons His comments came after Trump spoke by phone earlier Sunday with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, and Trump said he mentioned possibly sending Tomahawks during that conversation. “Do they want to have Tomahawks going in that direction? I don’t think so,” Trump said of Russia. “I think I might speak to Russia about that.” He added that “Tomahawks are a new step of aggression.” His suggestions followed Russia having attacked Ukraine’s power grid overnight, part of an ongoing campaign to cripple Ukrainian energy infrastructure before winter. Moscow also expressed “extreme concern” over the U.S. potentially providing Tomahawk cruise missiles to Ukraine. Putin himself has previously suggested that the United States supplying long-range missiles to Ukraine will seriously damage relations between Moscow and Washington. For his part, Zelenskyy described his latest call with Trump as “very productive,” and said the pair had discussed strengthening Ukraine’s “air defense, resilience, and long-range capabilities,” along with “details related to the energy sector.” VIDEO Trump in recent weeks has taken a notably tougher tact with Putin, after the Russian leader has declined to engage in direct talks with Zelenskyy about easing fighting. Last month, Trump announced that he now believes Ukraine could win back all the territory lost to Russia — a dramatic shift from the Republican’s repeated calls for Kyiv to make concessions to end Russia’s war in Ukraine. But the U.S. president, at least so far, has resisted Zelenskyy’s calls for Tomahawks. The weapon system would allow Ukraine to strike deeper into Russian territory and put the sort of pressure on Putin that Zelenskyy argues is needed to get the Russians to seriously engage in peace talks. Trump said aboard Air Force One of the war: “I really think Putin would look great if he got this settled” and that “It’s not going to be good for him” if not. ___ Weissert reported from Washington.

194e7dfc8e28,"On 12th day of shutdown, Vance warns new ‘painful’ cuts ahead","federal employees, federal workers, government shudown, j.d. vance, politics","Vice President JD Vance on Sunday said there will be deeper cuts to the federal workforce the longer the government shutdown goes on, adding to the uncertainty facing hundreds of thousands who are already furloughed without pay amid the stubborn stalemate in Congress. Vance warned that as the federal shutdown entered its 12th day, the new cuts would be “painful,” even as he said the Trump administration worked to ensure that the military is paid this week and some services would be preserved for low-income Americans, including food assistance. Still, hundreds of thousands of government workers have been furloughed in recent days and, in a court filing on Friday, the Office of Management and Budget said well over 4,000 federal employees would soon be fired in conjunction with the shutdown. The effects of the shutdown also grew Sunday with the Smithsonian announcing its museums, research centers and the National Zoo are temporarily closed going forward for lack of funding. “The longer this goes on, the deeper the cuts are going to be,” Vance said on Fox News’ “Sunday Morning Futures.” “To be clear, some of these cuts are going to be painful. This is not a situation that we relish. This is not something that we’re looking forward to, but the Democrats have dealt us a pretty difficult set of cards.” READ MORE: Trump directs Pentagon to use ‘all available funds’ to pay troops despite shutdown Labor unions have already filed a lawsuit to stop the aggressive move by President Donald Trump ’s budget office, which goes far beyond what usually happens in a government shutdown, further inflaming tensions between the Republicans who control Congress and the Democratic minority. The shutdown began on Oct. 1 after Democrats rejected a short-term funding fix and demanded that the bill include an extension of federal subsidies for health insurance under the Affordable Care Act. The expiration of those subsidies at the end of the year will result in monthly cost increases for millions. Trump and Republican leaders have said they are open to negotiations on the health subsidies, but insist the government must reopen first. For now, negotiations are virtually nonexistent. Dug in as ever, House leaders from both parties pointed fingers at each other in rival Sunday appearances on “Fox News Sunday.” “We have repeatedly made clear that we will sit down with anyone, anytime, anyplace,” said House Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries of New York. “Republicans control the House, the Senate and the presidency. It’s unfortunate they’ve taken a my-way-or-the-highway approach.” House Speaker Mike Johnson blamed Democrats and said they “seem not to care” about the pain the shutdown is inflicting. “They’re trying their best to distract the American people from the simple fact that they’ve chosen a partisan fight so that they can prove to their Marxist rising base in the Democratic Party that they’re willing to fight Trump and Republicans,” he said. VIDEO Progressive activists, meanwhile, expressed new support for the Democratic Party’s position in the shutdown fight. Ezra Levin, co-founder of the leading progressive protest group Indivisible, said he is “feeling good about the strength of Dem position.” He pointed to fractures in the GOP, noting that Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene publicly warned last week that health care insurance premiums would skyrocket for average Americans — including her own adult children — if nothing is done. “Trump and GOP are rightfully taking the blame for the shutdown and for looming premium increases,” Levin said. “Their chickens are coming home to roost.” And yet the Republican administration and its congressional allies are showing no signs of caving to Democratic demands or backing away from threats to use the opportunity to pursue deeper cuts to the federal workforce. Thousands of employees at the departments of Education, Treasury, Homeland Security and Health and Human Services, as well as the Environmental Protection Agency, are set to receive layoff notices, according to spokespeople for the agencies and union representatives for federal workers. “You hear a lot of Senate Democrats say, well, how can Donald Trump possibly lay off all of these federal workers?” Vance said. “Well, the Democrats have given us a choice between giving low-income women their food benefits and paying our troops on the one hand, and, on the other hand, paying federal bureaucrats.” Democrats say the firings are illegal and unnecessary. “They do not have to do this,” said Democratic Sen. Mark Kelly of Arizona on CNN’s “State of the Union.” “They do not have to punish people that shouldn’t find themselves in this position.” A free press is a cornerstone of a healthy democracy.

b2f2fae92c34,Russia targets Ukraine’s power grid as Moscow expresses ‘extreme concern’ over long-range U.S. weapons,"long-range missiles, power grid, power plant, russia, tomahawk cruise missiles, tomahawk missiles, ukraine, world","Russia attacked Ukraine’s power grid overnight, part of an ongoing campaign to cripple Ukrainian energy infrastructure before winter, and expressed “extreme concern” over the U.S. potentially providing Tomahawk cruise missiles to Ukraine. Kyiv regional Gov. Mykola Kalashnyk said two employees of Ukraine’s largest private energy company DTEK were wounded in Russian strikes on a substation. Ukraine’s Energy Ministry said that infrastructure was also targeted in the regions of Donetsk, Odesa and Chernihiv. “Russia continues its aerial terror against our cities and communities, intensifying strikes on our energy infrastructure,” Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy wrote on X, noting that Russia had launched “more than 3,100 drones, 92 missiles, and around 1,360 glide bombs” over the past week. READ MORE: How Europe can defend itself against Russian drones and electronic warfare Zelenskyy called for tighter secondary sanctions on buyers of Russian oil. “Sanctions, tariffs, and joint actions against the buyers of Russian oil — those who finance this war — must all remain on the table,” he wrote, adding he had a “very productive” phone call with U.S. President Donald Trump, in which they discussed strengthening Ukraine’s “air defense, resilience, and long-range capabilities,” along with “details related to the energy sector.” Their discussion followed an earlier conversation on Saturday, Zelenskyy said, during which the leaders agreed on Sunday’s topics. In an interview with Fox News Channel’s “The Sunday Briefing” after his call with Trump, Zelenskyy was asked whether Trump had approved the Tomahawks. “We work on it,” he said. “And I’m waiting for president to yes. Of course we count on such decisions, but we will see. We will see.” Zelenskyy said Friday that he was in talks with U.S. officials about the possible provision of various long-range precision strike weapons, including Tomahawks and more ATACMS tactical ballistic missiles. Trump, who has been frustrated by Russia in his efforts to end the war, said last week that he has “sort of made a decision” on whether to send Tomahawks to Ukraine, without elaborating. A senior Ukrainian delegation is set to visit the U.S. this week. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said in remarks published Sunday that “the topic of Tomahawks is of extreme concern.” “Now is really a very dramatic moment in terms of the fact that tensions are escalating from all sides,” he told Russian state television reporter Pavel Zarubin. VIDEO Belarus President Alexander Lukashenko, a close ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin, also said in comments released Sunday that he doubts the U.S. will provide Ukraine with Tomahawk cruise missiles. “I think we need to calm down in this regard. Our friend Donald … sometimes he takes a more forceful approach, and then, his tactic is to let go a little and step back. Therefore, we shouldn’t take this literally, as if it’s going to fly tomorrow,” Lukashenko told Zarubin, who posted them on his Telegram channel on Sunday. Ukraine’s energy sector has been a key battleground since Russia launched its all-out invasion more than three years ago. The latest attacks on Ukraine’s energy grid came after Russian drone and missile strikes wounded at least 20 people in Kyiv, damaged residential buildings and caused blackouts across the country Friday, which Prime Minister Yuliia Svyrydenko described as “one of the largest concentrated strikes” against Ukraine’s energy infrastructure. Each year, Russia has tried to cripple the Ukrainian power grid before the bitter winter season, apparently hoping to erode public morale. Winter temperatures run from late October through March, with January and February the coldest months. Ukraine’s air force said Saturday that its air defenses intercepted or jammed 103 of 118 Russian drones launched against Ukraine overnight, while Russia’s Defense Ministry said it had shot down 32 Ukrainian drones over Russian territory.

3f46d2ae00ae,China refuses to give in to Trump’s tariff threat,"china, donald trump news, tariffs, world","BEIJING (AP) — China signaled Sunday that it would not back down in the face of a 100% tariff threat from President Donald Trump, urging the U.S. to resolve differences through negotiations instead of threats. U.S. Vice President JD Vance defended Trump’s position and seemed to warn China not to be aggressive in its response. “China’s stance is consistent,” the Commerce Ministry said in a statement posted online. “We do not want a tariff war but we are not afraid of one.” It was China’s first official comment on Trump’s threat to jack up the tax on imports from China by Nov. 1 in response to new Chinese restrictions on the export of rare earths, which are vital to a wide range of consumer and military products. READ MORE: Wall Street tumbles in its worst day since April after Trump threatens more tariffs on China The back and forth threatens to derail a possible meeting between Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping and end a truce in a trade war in which new tariffs from both sides briefly topped 100% in April. In response, Vance said Sunday that Trump is committed to protecting America’s economic livelihoods while making the United States more self-sufficient. He said the fact that China has “so much control over critical supply in the United States of America” is the definition of a national emergency and therefore justifies Trump’s move to impose tough tariffs. “It’s going to be delicate dance and a lot of it is going to depend on how the Chinese respond. If they respond in a highly aggressive manner, I guarantee you the president of the United States has far more cards than the People’s Republic of China,” Vance said on Fox News Channel’s “Sunday Morning Futures.” “If, however, they’re willing to be reasonable, then Donald Trump is always willing to be a reasonable negotiator. We’re going to find out a lot in the weeks to come about whether China wants to start a trade war with us or whether they actually want to be reasonable,” Vance continued. “I hope they choose the path of reason. The president of the United States is going to defend America regardless.” Trump has raised taxes on imports from many U.S. trading partners since taking office in January, seeking to win concessions. China has been one of the few countries that hasn’t backed down, relying on its economic clout. “Frequently resorting to the threat of high tariffs is not the correct way to get along with China,” the Commerce Ministry said in its post, which was presented as a series of answers from an unnamed spokesperson to four questions from unspecified media outlets. The statement called for addressing any concerns through dialogue. “If the U.S. side obstinately insists on its practice, China will be sure to resolutely take corresponding measures to safeguard its legitimate rights and interests,” the post said. VIDEO In addition to the 100% tariff, Trump threatened to impose export controls on what he called “critical software,” without specifying what that means. Both sides accuse the other of violating the spirit of the truce by imposing new restrictions on trade. Trump said in a social media post that China is “becoming very hostile” and that it is holding the world captive by restricting access to rare earth metals and magnets. The Chinese Commerce Ministry post said the U.S. has introduced several new restrictions in recent weeks, including expanding the number of Chinese companies subject to U.S. export controls. On rare earths, the ministry said that export licenses would be granted for legitimate civilian uses, noting that the minerals also have military applications. The new regulations include a requirement that foreign companies get Chinese government approval to export items that contain rare earths sourced from China, no matter where the products are manufactured. China accounts for nearly 70% of the world’s rare earths mining and controls roughly 90% of their global processing. Access to the material is a key point of contention in trade talks between Washington and Beijing. The critical minerals go into many products, from jet engines, radar systems and electric vehicles to consumer electronics including laptops and phones. China’s export controls have hit European and other manufacturers, as well as American ones. The Commerce Ministry statement said that the U.S. is also ignoring Chinese concerns by going forward with new port fees on Chinese ships that take effect Tuesday. China announced Friday that it would impose port fees on American ships in response. Associated Press writer Darlene Superville in Washington contributed to this report.

b35e53f5b596,WATCH: Trump departs for Middle East as ceasefire agreement holds in Gaza,"donald trump news, egypt, israel, middle east, politics","WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump set off for Israel and Egypt on Sunday to celebrate the U.S.-brokered ceasefire and hostage deal between Israel and Hamas and urge Middle East allies to seize the opportunity to build a durable peace in the volatile region. It’s a fragile moment with Israel and Hamas only in the early stages of implementing the first phase of the Trump agreement designed to bring a permanent end to the war sparked by the Oct. 7, 2023, attack on Israel by Hamas-led militants. Trump thinks there is a narrow window to reshape the Mideast and reset long-fraught relations between Israel and its Arab neighbors. READ MORE: Trump achieved a breakthrough Gaza ceasefire, but a tough road lies ahead It is a moment, the Republican president says, that has been helped along by his administration’s support of Israel’s decimation of Iranian proxies, including Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon. “Very excited about this moment in time,” Trump told reporters before Air Force One took off. He said many people in both Israel and Arab countries were “cheering” the agreement, adding that “everybody’s amazed and their thrilled and we’re going to have an amazing time.” The White House says momentum is also building because Arab and Muslim states are demonstrating a renewed focus on resolving the broader, decades-long Israeli-Palestinian conflict and, in some cases, deepening relations with the United States. Trump’s comments as the trip began followed him saying Friday that, “I think you are going to have tremendous success and Gaza is going to be rebuilt” and that “you have some very wealthy countries, as you know, over there. It would take a small fraction of their wealth to do that. And I think they want to do it.” A tenuous point in the agreement The first phase of the ceasefire agreement calls for the release of the final 48 hostages held by Hamas, including about 20 believed to be alive; the release of hundreds of Palestinian prisoners held by Israel; a surge of humanitarian aid to Gaza; and a partial pullback by Israeli forces from Gaza’s main cities. Israeli troops on Friday finished withdrawing from parts of Gaza, triggering a 72-hour countdown under the deal for Hamas to release the Israeli hostages, potentially while Trump is on the ground there. He said he expected their return to be completed on Monday or Tuesday. Trump said he will first visit Israel, where he has been invited to address Israel’s parliament, the Knesset, an honor last extended to President George W. Bush during a visit in 2008. Trump then will travel to Egypt, where he and Egyptian President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi will lead a summit in Sharm el-Sheikh with leaders from more than 20 countries to discuss peace in Gaza and the broader Middle East. VIDEO It is a tenuous truce and it is unclear whether the sides have reached any agreement on Gaza’s postwar governance, the territory’s reconstruction and Israel’s demand that Hamas disarm. Negotiations over those issues could break down, and Israel has hinted it may resume military operations if its demands are not met. “I think the chances of (Hamas) disarming themselves, you know, are pretty close to zero,” H.R. McMaster, a national security adviser during Trump’s first term, said at an event hosted by the Foundation for the Defense of Democracies on Thursday. He said he thought what probably would happen in the coming months is that the Israeli military “is going to have to destroy them.” Israel continues to rule over millions of Palestinians without basic rights as settlements expand rapidly across the occupied West Bank. Despite growing international recognition, Palestinian statehood appears exceedingly remote because of Israel’s opposition and actions on the ground, The war has left Israel isolated internationally and facing allegations of genocide, which it denies. International arrest warrants against Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his former defense minister are in effect, and the United Nations’ highest court is considering allegations of genocide brought by South Africa. Hamas has been militarily decimated and has given up its only bargaining chip with Israel by releasing the hostages. But the Islamic militant group is still intact and could eventually rebuild if there’s an extended period of calm. Netanyahu reiterated that Israel would continue with its demilitarization of Hamas after the hostages are returned. “Hamas agreed to the deal only when it felt that the sword was on its neck — and it is still on its neck,” Netanyahu said Friday as Israel began to pull back its troops. Trump wants to expand the Abraham Accords Much of Gaza has been reduced to rubble and rebuilding is expected to take years. The territory’s roughly 2 million residents continue to struggle in desperate conditions. Under the deal, Israel agreed to reopen five border crossings, which will help ease the flow of food and other supplies into Gaza, parts of which are experiencing famine. Trump is also standing up a U.S.-led civil-military coordination center in Israel to help facilitate the flow of humanitarian aid as well as logistical and security assistance into Gaza. Roughly 200 U.S. troops will be sent to help support and monitor the ceasefire deal as part of a team that includes partner nations, nongovernmental organizations and private-sector players. The White House has signaled that Trump is looking to quickly return attention to building on a first-term effort known as the Abraham Accords, which forged diplomatic and commercial ties between Israel and the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Morocco. A permanent agreement in Gaza would help pave the path for Trump to begin talks with Saudi Arabia as well Indonesia, the most populous Muslim country, toward normalizing ties with Israel, according to a senior Trump administration official who briefed reporters on the condition of anonymity. Such a deal with Saudi Arabia, the most powerful and wealthy Arab state, has the potential to reshape the region and boost Israel’s standing in historic ways. But brokering such an agreement remains a heavy lift as the kingdom has said it won’t officially recognize Israel before a resolution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.

ab8c7113e5e4,"Appeals court rules U.S. troops Trump sent to Illinois can stay, but can’t be deployed for now","donald trump news, illinois, national guard, politics","CHICAGO (AP) — National Guard troops sent to Illinois by President Donald Trump can stay in the state and under federal control, but can’t be deployed to protect federal property or go on patrol for now, an appeals court ruled Saturday. READ MORE: What to know about Trump’s National Guard deployments in Chicago and Portland The decision comes after federal Judge April Perry on Thursday ruled to temporarily block the National Guard deployment for at least two weeks, finding no substantial evidence that a “danger of rebellion” is brewing in Illinois during Trump’s immigration crackdown. The appeals court on Saturday granted a pause in the case until it can hear further arguments. The on-again, off-again deployments stem from a political and legal battle over Trump’s push to send the Guard to several U.S. cities. His administration claims crime is rampant in those cities, despite statistics not always supporting that. If a president invokes the Insurrection Act, they can dispatch active duty military in states that fail to put down an insurrection or defy federal law. However, Perry said she found no substantial evidence that a “danger of rebellion” is brewing in Illinois during Trump’s immigration crackdown. She followed up Friday with an opinion that cites a mix of law and history, including the Federalist Papers, which were written in 1787-88 to support ratification of the U.S. Constitution. “There has been no showing that the civil power has failed,” Perry said. “The agitators who have violated the law by attacking federal authorities have been arrested. The courts are open, and the marshals are ready to see that any sentences of imprisonment are carried out. Resort to the military to execute the laws is not called for.” The judge said there was significant evidence that federal agents have been able to carry out their work, noting “huge increases in arrests and deportations.” The 500 Guard members from Texas and Illinois were mostly based at a U.S. Army Reserve Center in Elwood, southwest of Chicago.

5aebbb062491,Trump directs Pentagon to use ‘all available funds’ to pay troops despite shutdown,"donald trump news, government shutdown, military pay, u.s. military, politics","WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump said Saturday that he has directed the Defense Department to use “all available funds” to ensure U.S. troops are paid Wednesday despite the government shutdown, a short-term fix that will not apply to the hundreds of thousands of federal workers who have been furloughed. Trump said in a social media post that he was acting because “our Brave Troops will miss the paychecks they are rightfully due on October 15th.” The Republican president’s directive removes one of the pressure points that could have forced Congress into action, likely ensuring that the shutdown — now in its 11th day and counting — extends into a third week and possibly beyond. But no similar action seems forthcoming for federal employees also working without pay while thousands are now being laid off during the lapse in government operations. The White House budget office started the layoffs on Friday. WATCH: Trump White House orders more federal layoffs amid shutdown Trump blamed Democrats and said he was exercising his authority as commander in chief to direct Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth “to use all available funds to get our Troops PAID on October 15th.” The Republican president added, “We have identified funds to do this, and Secretary Hegseth will use them to PAY OUR TROOPS.” U.S service members were in danger of not receiving their next paycheck on Wednesday after the government shut down on Oct. 1, the start of the federal budget cycle. The U.S. has about 1.3 million active-duty service members, and the prospect of troops going without pay has been a focal point when lawmakers on Capitol Hill have discussed the shutdown’s negative impact. Trump did not say where he’s getting the money. One possible source would be the billions of dollars that were pumped into the Defense Department under Trump’s big tax and spending cut bill that he signed into law in July. The Congressional Budget Office said such a move was possible. A spokesperson for the White House Office of Management and Budget said Pentagon research and development funds would be used to pay the salaries. Federal workers typically receive back pay after a shutdown ends, as now required by a law that Trump signed during his first term. He recently floated the idea of not making up the lost salaries. It was unclear if the president’s directive applies to the U.S. Coast Guard, which is a branch of the U.S. Armed Forces but is overseen by the Department of Homeland Security during peacetime. The nation’s third shutdown in 12 years has again raised anxiety levels among service members and their families as those in uniform are working without pay. While they would receive back pay once the impasse ends, many military families live paycheck to paycheck. During previous shutdowns, Congress passed legislation to ensure that troops kept earning their salaries, but discussion of taking a similar step by lawmakers appeared to have fizzled out. Asked earlier this week if he would support a bill to pay the troops, Trump said, “that probably will happen.” “We’ll take care of it,” he said Wednesday. “Our military is always going to be taken care of.” The shutdown began on Oct. 1 after Democrats rejected a short-term funding fix and demanded that the bill include an extension of federal subsidies for health insurance under the Affordable Care Act. The expiration of those subsidies at the end of the year will result in monthly cost increases for millions of people. Trump and Republican leaders have said they are open to negotiations on the health subsidies, but insist the government must reopen first. Both sides appear dug in on their positions, making it unclear when, or how, the shutdown ends. A free press is a cornerstone of a healthy democracy. Support trusted journalism and civil dialogue.

5c25786ceaed,"Biden is receiving radiation and hormone therapy to treat his prostate cancer, aide says","cancer, joe biden, prostate cancer, politics","WASHINGTON (AP) — Former President Joe Biden is receiving radiation and hormone therapy as part of a new phase of treating the aggressive form of prostate cancer he was diagnosed with after leaving office, a spokesperson said Saturday. “As part of a treatment plan for prostate cancer, President Biden is currently undergoing radiation therapy and hormone treatment,” said Biden aide Kelly Scully. WATCH: After Biden’s diagnosis, a look at prostate cancer’s impact on men in the U.S. The 82-year-old Democrat left office in January after he had dropped his bid for reelection six months earlier following a disastrous debate against Republican Donald Trump amid concerns about Biden’s age, health and mental fitness. Trump defeated Democrat Kamala Harris, who was Biden’s vice president. In May, Biden’s postpresidential office announced that he had been diagnosed with prostate cancer and that it had spread to his bone. The discovery came after he reported urinary symptoms. Prostate cancers are graded for aggressiveness using what is known as a Gleason score. The scores range from 6 to 10, with 8, 9 and 10 prostate cancers behaving more aggressively. Biden’s office said his score was 9, suggesting his cancer is among the most aggressive. Last month, Biden had surgery to remove skin cancer lesions from his forehead.

1bab36ee4e74,"Candidates in Virginia governor’s debate clash over government shutdown, violent rhetoric","abigail spanberger, debates, elections, gubernatorial races, virginia, winsome earle-sears, politics","Spanberger, who largely avoided addressing her Republican opponent directly, set a more sterile and bipartisan tone. The personal clashes overshadowed the policy fights at times, which focused on violent rhetoric, the federal shutdown and transgender children. The economy was an afterthought. Here are some takeaways from the debate at Norfolk State University: A contrast in styles Perhaps even more than policy differences, the candidates’ personal styles shaped the debate. Earle-Sears, with her only chance to confront Spanberger before Election Day, was far more aggressive. She repeatedly turned toward Spanberger and interrupted her answers, despite being admonished by the moderators. The approach put the Democrat on the defensive after months of running the race largely on her own terms as the perceived frontrunner. Democratic gubernatorial candidate and former Rep. Abigail Spanberger, D-Va., addresses a small get-out-the-vote rally on the first day of early voting in Henrico, Virginia. Photo by Chip Somodevilla/ Getty Images Spanberger, while she criticized her opponent at times, faced forward throughout, avoided eye contact and only rarely addressed Earle-Sears directly. She did not speak during Earle-Sears’ answers, even when her opponent asked direct questions, resulting in moments of awkward silence. Earle-Sears told Spanberger she was a liar, said she “should have stayed in Congress” and questioned her courage. “Don’t lie like that, Abigail!” she shouted at one point. The interruptions lasted up until the very final moments, when the moderators cut off the microphones. A scandal at the outset A scandal shaped the very beginning of the debate, although it was not a scandal directly involving either candidate onstage. Instead, it was the Democratic nominee for attorney general, Jay Jones. He has been heavily criticized in recent days following last week’s publication of text messages from 2022 in which he suggested that Virginia’s former Republican House speaker get “two bullets in the head.” Earle-Sears, along with President Donald Trump, has demanded that Jones quit his race. Over and over again Thursday night, the Republican pushed Spanberger to do the same. “Abigail, what if he said it about your three children? Is that when you would say it’s time to get out of the race?” Earle-Sears asked. She later added, “She has no courage.” Facing repeated questions from the moderators and her opponent, the Democratic congresswoman declined to say whether Jones should leave the race, saying it’s up to voters to make their own decision. “I have denounced political violence, political rhetoric, no matter who is leading the charge,” Spanberger responded, pointing to violent rhetoric from Trump that Earle-Sears declined to denounce. “You routinely refer to me as your enemy. I’m not your enemy. You are not my enemy. We are political opponents,” Spanberger said. The shutdown The showdown over the shutdown flared Thursday night. Underway for more than a week, the federal shutdown is especially prevalent in Virginia, home to roughly 315,000 federal workers. Even before much of the federal government closed its doors last week, many Virginians were already affected by Trump’s spring push to slash federal jobs and his ongoing threats to impose more mass firings. Earle-Sears, a vocal Trump supporter, declined to criticize Trump or call on him to stop firing federal workers when asked directly by the moderators. Instead, she blamed Democrats for the mess and called on Spanberger to push Virginia Sens. Tim Kaine and Mark Warner, both Democrats, to vote in favor of a spending bill that would end the impasse with the Republican-controlled Congress. Spanberger responded, “I would encourage everyone, our Democratic senators, our Democratic House members, our Republican House members, to work and come back to the table.” Culture wars vs. wallets Many voters say they’re most concerned about the economy, but some of the most pointed moments of the debate were on cultural issues. In particular, Earle-Sears pressed Spanberger on whether she would keep transgender youths out of high school sports and bathrooms. The Republican lieutenant governor has flooded the airwaves with ads focused on the cultural divide that helped Trump win the presidency last fall, casting Spanberger as unwilling to protect Virginia’s children from sexual predators. “My answer is that each local community decision should be made between parents and educators and teachers in each community,” Spanberger said, pointing to her background in law enforcement and role as a mother. “Nothing is more important to me than the safety of all children,” she said. Spanberger declined to say whether she would rescind the measure signed by Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin that would require students to go only to the restrooms of their birth gender. That did not satisfy Earle-Sears, who pressed Spanberger on what she would say if her own children were forced to undress in a bathroom with biological males. The Republican also implied that transgender students are a safety threat when asked. “We know that biological men are larger in strength than women,” she said. “This is biology.” Spanberger then sought to put Earle-Sears on the defensive, noting that the Republican opposes abortion rights and wants to outlaw gay marriage — something Earle-Sears didn’t object to. “My opponent has previously said that she doesn’t think that gay couples have the right to marry,” Spanberger said. “That’s not discrimination,” Earle-Sears interrupted. History in the making Two women stood on the debate stage as the Democratic and Republican nominees for the first time in state history, a reminder that Virginia is poised to elect its first female governor, no matter who wins on Nov. 4. Spanberger, 46, is a mother of three school-age children. She has represented a congressional district in northern Virginia since 2019. She is a former CIA case officer. In one of the few warm exchanges of the night, Earle-Sears pointed to Spanberger’s role as a mother when asked what qualities she likes about her opponent. “I believe she is a devoted mom. I truly believe that,” Earle-Sears said. “And I do believe that she cares.” Earle-Sears, a Marine veteran, may be better known statewide, having served as lieutenant governor for the last four years. A native of Jamaica, the 61-year-old mother of two, is the first Black woman elected to statewide office in Virginia. Spanberger complimented parts of her record. “I admire her faith,” Spanberger said, “and her service to this country.” Peoples reported from New York. Beaumont reported from Des Moines, Iowa.

32ede57693c4,Trump White House orders more federal layoffs amid shutdown,"donald trump news, federal workers, government shutdown, russell vought, politics","As the federal government shutdown heads into its second weekend, the Trump administration has begun what it calls “substantial” layoffs of federal workers. President Trump and his team had suggested this would be coming, but it was Office of Management and Budget Director Russell Vought who made it official. Congressional correspondent Lisa Desjardins reports on the agencies affected. Geoff Bennett: As the federal government shutdown heads into its second weekend, the Trump administration has started what it says are substantial layoffs of federal workers. The president and his team had suggested this would be coming, but it was Office of Management and Budget Director Russell Vought who made it official on social media this afternoon, stating simply: ""The RIFs have begun."" For more on what agencies might be affected by this reduction in force, we turn to our congressional correspondent, Lisa Desjardins. Lisa, you have been working the phones all afternoon. Lisa Desjardins: Yes. Geoff Bennett: What have you learned? Lisa Desjardins: Our whole team has. Well, President Trump actually just spoke to reporters a few minutes ago. And he said the layoffs, there will be a lot of them, but that numbers will still be coming. We don't have the numbers yet. So there is a real question here about how widespread these substantial RIFs, or layoffs, are, as we have been told by the Office of Management and Budget. Are they really large, or is it that the administration wants them to be perceived that way, so that they can leverage and pressure Democrats, among others? One thing we do know a little bit about is where they are happening. From our calls and sourcing today, we can report that these eight agencies will be seeing these mass layoffs. This includes some large agencies like Department of Homeland Security, the Treasury and Education. Many of these did experience large staffing cuts, either from the DOGE retirement plan or from previous layoffs. Now, again, we don't know how large they are. The IRS has confirmed to me that there are in fact mass layoffs happening there, again, don't know how large. There is a union that has said they think perhaps 1,300 People may have been laid off at Treasury, but we need to see the notices. And one reason that's important is, when do these take effect? Thirty days, by law, is the minimum notice that must be given for these reductions in force. Geoff Bennett: And, as we said, there's a lot we don't know. But are there specific examples of agencies or programs that have been targeted for these cuts? Lisa Desjardins: We do know of one where we can get specific. This is a subagency of the Department of Homeland Security. It's known as CISA. That stands for the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency. They watch basically the digital world, the Internet, protect Americans from threats from that area. Now, I know, I have reported — well, first of all, the agency is about 2,500 people, for perspective; 127 of them are going to be laid off or have been laid off. So that's about 5 percent of the agency. But here's the thing. They are all within one subdivision, a subdivision that specializes in dealing with corporations and social media, the same subdivision that Republicans say took down political speech, and it is the one that was blocking disinformation dealing with Facebook. So that's a targeted agency that Republicans don't like; 70 percent of that group is being cut here. I bring this up because President Trump also just told reporters that, again, this will be Democratic-oriented cuts. So we have to watch. What does this mean agency to agency? How much of it is about policy? Geoff Bennett: Lisa Desjardins, our thanks to you, as always.

8062b58dd383,WATCH: Kilmar Abrego Garcia’s attorneys discuss ICE’s continued efforts to deport him to Africa,"africa, deportations, eswatini, ghana, immigration, immigration and customs enforcement, kilmar abrego garcia, politics","GREENBELT, Md. (AP) — The Trump administration is pushing again to deport Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Maryland man who was mistakenly sent to El Salvador, and hasn’t given up on moving him to Eswatini or Ghana even though both have rejected the idea, an immigration official told a judge Friday. Abrego Garcia has challenged efforts to re-deport him to a third country after the government admitted that a previous order prevents his deportation to his home country of El Salvador. U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement said recently that it plans to deport him to the southern African country of Eswatini. WATCH: Kilmar Abrego Garcia’s attorney discusses his case amid new deportation effort The case has come to represent the bitter partisan struggle over the President Donald Trump’s sweeping immigration policy and mass deportation agenda. U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis in Maryland will decide whether Abrego Garcia should remain in custody or be released from immigration detention while his challenge moves forward. She ordered government officials to explain the steps they have taken to remove Abrego Garcia to another country. An ICE official told the judge during a hearing Friday that the government was continuing to talk with officials in Eswatini about sending him there even though the country rejected the idea this week. He said his understanding is that the administration also was still in discussions with Ghana. However, Ghana’s foreign minister, Sam Okudzeto Ablakwa, posted on social media Friday that the nation will not accept Abrego Garcia. Abrego Garcia could be removed within 72 hours if the judge allows it and once the administration receives approval from a third country, said John Schultz, a deputy assistant director who helps oversee removals for ICE. “We could quickly operationalize the removal,” Schultz said. Abrego Garcia’s attorneys have charged that the Republican administration is trying to illegally use the immigration system to punish him after the embarrassment of his mistaken deportation. Meanwhile, attorneys in criminal court in Tennessee have made similar claims about retribution in the human smuggling charges brought against Abrego Garcia in June on the day he was returned to the U.S. from El Salvador. The Tennessee judge has concluded that Abrego Garcia’s prosecution may be an illegal retaliation after he successfully sued the Trump administration over his deportation. The smuggling charges stem from a 2022 traffic stop in Tennessee. Abrego Garcia was not charged at the time, and agents did not begin investigating the stop until earlier this year after his wife sued over his deportation. At a Friday hearing in Nashville, U.S. District Judge Waverly Crenshaw said he will hear evidence on the motion to dismiss the charges on Nov. 3. In addition, defense attorneys said they intend to file a motion asking that statements unrelated to the smuggling charges be removed from the indictment. Attorney Jenna Dabbs cited allegations that her client is a member of the MS-13 gang as an example of the extraneous accusations that are not relevant to the actual charges. Trump administration officials have waged a relentless public relations campaign against Abrego Garcia, repeatedly referring to him as a member of MS-13, among other things, despite the fact he has not been convicted of any crimes.

0b68692ef442,"Trump showing ‘no interest’ in negotiating to end shutdown, Jeffries says","donald trump news, government shutdown, hakeem jeffries, politics","Geoff Bennett: Well, keeping our focus on the shutdown, yesterday, we heard from Republican Senate Majority Leader John Thune. And, today, for a Democratic view, I spoke earlier with House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries. Leader Jeffries, welcome back to the ""News Hour."" Rep. Hakeem Jeffries (D-NY): Thanks for having me on. Geoff Bennett: When you were on this program nine days ago, you said there'd been no communication from either the White House or Republican leaders in the House or the Senate about ending this shutdown. It doesn't appear that that's changed. Has it? Rep. Hakeem Jeffries: It has not changed, unfortunately. This is day 10 of the Trump-Republican shutdown. Clearly, they don't want to reopen the government. As Democrats, we have made clear we will sit down with anyone, any time, any place to have a bipartisan negotiation about enacting a spending bill that makes life better for the American people, reopens the government, and addresses the Republican health care crisis. Unfortunately, House Republicans, who canceled votes last week, canceled votes this week, and have now canceled votes next week, remain on vacation, missing in action. And Donald Trump has shown no interest in actually trying to resolve this situation. Geoff Bennett: What do you make of these Republican proposals to partially reopen the government, funding select agencies, while leaving other ones shuttered? Rep. Hakeem Jeffries: I think it's important for us to make sure that we actually pay our men and women in uniform in a manner consistent with what has been done in prior shutdowns. That should be priority number on, at this moment, more than 1.3 million people who are on active-duty and have been asked to work without pay because of the Republican refusal to address this issue. And so I think we need to take that step forward and then evaluate whatever other proposals come forward relative to reopening the government. But we have to reopen the government in a way that also addresses the Republican health care crisis and the Republicans' continued refusal to extend the Affordable Care Act tax credits, which is going to have a devastating impact on premiums, co-pays, and deductibles for tens of millions of Americans all across the country. Geoff Bennett: As we speak this afternoon, the OMB director, Russ Vought, tweeted moments ago, ""The RIFs have begun,"" making good apparently on the threat of mass layoffs by the Trump administration. An OMB spokesperson says that the layoffs will be significant. Do you have a sense of which agencies would be affected, how many people would be affected? And, beyond that, this is a clear power play by the administration to force the hand of Democrats. Does this play any role in your decision-making? Rep. Hakeem Jeffries: Donald Trump and his corrupt administration have been engaging in mass firings and layoffs of federal employees since January 20. They have been targeting hardworking federal employees, pressuring them, dismissing them without justification and violating the law. So this is just a continuation of the chaos, the crisis, and the confusion that we have seen during the entirety of the Trump administration. We're going to continue to stay the course as Democrats. That's what House and Senate Democrats have done together to address this the situation that Republicans have created, largest cut to Medicaid in American history, hospitals, nursing homes, and community-based health clinics closing all throughout America, particularly in rural parts of this country. The fact that Republicans refuse to extend the Affordable Care Act tax credits, resulting in dramatically increased health care premiums for tens of millions of Americans that will cost double, triple, or quadruple what they are currently paying. Some will face medical bankruptcy. Many others will be unable to get the insurance and the access to the doctors that they need. And on top of all of that, they're targeting the National Institutes of Health, the Centers for Disease Control in ways that are going to undermine the public health infrastructure in the United States of America. This has been an all-out Republican assault on the health care of the American people, which is why it needs to be decisively addressed right now, because it impacts everyone. Geoff Bennett: When you talk about Democrats and Republicans working together on health care, Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene, who, as you well know, no fan of Democrats, not typically aligned with Democrats, says she supports preserving the ACA subsidies, in large part because she says the insurance premiums of her adult children are set to skyrocket. Does that signal any real opening for bipartisan cooperation? Rep. Hakeem Jeffries: I think what it signals is a growing recognition amongst my Republican colleagues that we have a health care crisis. Unfortunately, it's the health care crisis that they have created. And it needs to be decisively addressed. House Republican leaders continue to bury their heads in the sand, unfortunately, and they're joined by Senate Republican leadership that continues to force vote after vote on their partisan Republican spending bill that Democrats aren't supporting because that partisan Republican spending bill continues to gut the health care of everyday Americans. And that's not an acceptable situation in this country, the wealthiest country in the history of the world. Geoff Bennett: I want to ask you about the politics of all this, because, just the other day, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, he said that Democrats have the momentum and he said — quote — ""Every day gets better for us."" Republicans are seizing upon that, including the Senate majority leader, John Thune, who was on this program last night, and they are accusing Democrats of politicizing the shutdown. Do you worry that a moment like that, a statement like that undercuts what you see as Democrats having the moral high ground? Rep. Hakeem Jeffries: Well, House Democrats and Senate Democrats led by Leader Schumer are in this fight to make life better for the American people, to lower health care costs, to address the Republican health care crisis, to cancel the cuts, and to save the health care of the American people. That's the reason why we're in this fight. Geoff Bennett: For federal workers who risk missing a paycheck, for military families facing uncertainty, for everyday Americans who want to visit a national park, they are all wondering, when will this shutdown end? What would you tell them? Rep. Hakeem Jeffries: We need Donald Trump and Republicans to come to the negotiating table. We want to reopen the government. We want to reopen it now. We want to reach a bipartisan agreement in a way that spends taxpayer dollars that actually improve the quality of life of the American people, that addresses the cost of living crisis that we're confronting in this country. Donald Trump and Republicans promised that costs would go down on day one. But costs aren't going down under Republican control of government here in Washington. Costs are going up. Inflation is going up. The Trump tariffs are making life more expensive for millions of Americans who are paying thousands of dollars in additional expense per year. And now we're on the brink of this massive increase in premiums, co-pays, and deductibles because of Republican refusal to sit down and negotiate an extension around the Affordable Care Act tax credits. We stand by our hardworking federal employees. We will continue to support them. We stand by the American people, and we want to bring this to a close, but we need good faith partners on the other side of the aisle to sit down and negotiate a bipartisan path forward. Geoff Bennett: House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries, thanks again for your time. We appreciate it. Rep. Hakeem Jeffries: Thank you.",https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/trump-showing-no-interest-in-negotiating-to-end-shutdown-jeffries-says,Politics,BBC,,https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/static/2025/10/shutdown-3-1024x683.jpg,2025-10-10T18:40:06-04:00,2896766906d292c8950a8987bc940cceb6b5b7e0
c5049f71e260,Unlikely alliance builds cleaner geothermal energy network in Massachusetts community,"basic research, geothermal energy, massachusetts, science, tipping point, science","Geoff Bennett: Now the story of an unlikely partnership between a utility company and climate activists and how they worked together to help one community switch its heating and cooling to a cleaner source. Science correspondent Miles O'Brien has the story, part of our Tipping Point coverage on energy and climate. Miles O’Brien: Retired schoolteacher Carol Canova has lived in this tiny little house in Framingham, Massachusetts for 30 years. From this humble perch, she has experienced firsthand a historic energy transition. She started with an oil-burning furnace, then switched to gas, and now heats and cools with an electric heat pump attached to a geothermal well. Carol Canova, Framingham, Massachusetts, Resident: I was told it would be even heat. I was told it would be efficient and so forth. But seeing is believing. I'd never been in a house that every place in the house was the same temperature. Miles O’Brien: Canova is part of a first-in-the-nation pilot by utility giant Eversource. It's a one-mile network of underground pipes connecting three dozen homes and municipal buildings to a shared geothermal well. It's called networked geothermal, and if it works here, it could be a blueprint for utilities nationwide. Carol Canova: So I thought, oh, electricity is expensive. So I'm expecting it's going to be more expensive. What I find out is, it's overall cheaper. Miles O’Brien: Heat pumps live up to their name. They move heat. In the summer, they pump heat out of your home. In the winter, they bring it in. How hard they have to work and how much electricity they use depends on the temperature difference between inside and outside. The greater the gap, the more energy they need. Shallow geothermal wells tap into the earth's steady underground temperature, about 55 degrees year-round. Water with antifreeze circulates through buried pipes, absorbing or releasing heat at that consistent temperature. A heat pump paired with a geothermal well has less work to do and is far more efficient no matter the weather above. The catch? Drilling a geothermal well is very expensive, but none of the volunteers in this project paid a dime for either the well or the heat pump. Carol Canova: When Eversource offered it, I thought, you know what, this is like winning the lottery. Nikki Bruno, Vice President, Eversource: Everything else is buried in underground, except for the heat pumps. Miles O’Brien: Nikki Bruno is an Eversource V.P. Nikki Bruno: So, right outside this building is what we call the main bore field. Miles O’Brien: She showed me the pump house, which controls the entire system. It's the only visible sign of the geothermal network. Nikki Bruno: Those bores are 600 to 700 pipes that allow the water-based fluid to circulate and exchange energy with the underground. Miles O’Brien: Besides many homes like Carol's, heat pumps attached to the geothermal network are in use at a school administration building, a fire station, and a public housing development. It's an $18.6 million project that comes amid significant changes in regulations. Massachusetts and the other states in the Eversource territory have aggressive climate goals and mandates. Nikki Bruno: How do we start offering something different? How can we produce a decarbonized product for our customers, while keeping safe, reliable and I will say as affordable as possible service to customers? Miles O’Brien: The idea was born of an unlikely partnership between utility executives and climate activists, among them, Zeybeb Magavi, the executive director of the nonprofit HEET, the Home Energy Efficiency Team. It's a grassroots group that started out by banding together to insulate their homes. They were looking for a way to make a bigger dent. Zeybeb Magavi, Executive Director, HEET: We really became aware of kind of a rock-and-a-hard place problem, where we have a gas system that actually we have pipes in the ground from President Lincoln's time. Miles O’Brien: Their focus on creaky, leaky gas pipes led them to a moment of insight and inspiration. Zeybeb Magavi: The ground, the bedrock, the water all around us is thermal energy, which we can tap. And that's kind of an exciting awakening thing to realize. We could potentially build a utility street by street that was pipes filled with water, maintained and managed by the gas utility, who — becomes a thermal utility. This infrastructure would be in a way like the roots of our new energy system, right? Miles O’Brien: Even federal researchers are bullish. A study by the Oak Ridge National Laboratory found that mass adoption of geothermal heat pumps could reduce the demand for electricity by 13 percent in the next 25 years. But the idea isn't new. Let's go down in the boiler room. Here we go. You got people down here shoveling coal, right? Jeff Tester, Engineering Professor, Cornell University: This is our living laboratory. Miles O’Brien: Cornell University engineering professor Jeff Tester built his home in Ithaca, New York, as a living lab of efficiency, solar thermal, photovoltaics, and a heat pump that taps into a geothermal well buried in his backyard. He's been advocating for ways to tap the heat beneath our feet since the 1970s, when he helped pioneer a novel geothermal energy concept at the Los Alamos National Laboratory. Jeff Tester: One method of extracting heat or mining heat from under the surface of the earth is to create a reservoir. Miles O’Brien: He looks back on those days with nostalgia. Jeff Tester: They were very supportive of trying new things in those days. We weren't afraid to try something. Miles O’Brien: For about 25 years, Cornell has harnessed a natural thermal engine to keep its campus cool. A district-chilling system taps 39-degree water from the depths of Cayuga Lake to cool more than 100 buildings. Now the university is looking to go deeper and warmer. Jeff Tester is the principal investigator on a groundbreaking project to introduce geothermal heating to the campus. In 2022, his team drilled a nearly two-mile-deep test borehole to assess the available heat resources here. Jeff Tester: I feel like I have been training all my life for the day when we actually would see this happen on a campus like Cornell. Miles O’Brien: But he's still waiting, looking for money to build a geothermal network of pipes filled with hot water to heat the campus. He says society places great value on fossil fuels and electricity. Jeff Tester: But heat is not viewed that way in the same way, and I think we need a fairer system of what I refer to as an equivalent way to actually look at the benefits from clean heating versus clean electricity versus clean fuels. And we're not doing that right now. So we need a new value system for energy. Miles O’Brien: The Trump administration apparently does value geothermal. Energy Secretary Chris Wright consistently emphasizes it as a priority, making it the only renewable energy source currently in favor. Zeybeb Magavi: It's something we can agree on.

6eead56302a0,Brooks and Capehart on Trump’s focus on reaching the Gaza peace deal,"brooks and capehart, politics","Geoff Bennett: With President Trump celebrating victories abroad and targeting political enemies here at home, there is much to discuss tonight with Brooks and Capehart. That's New York Times columnist David Brooks and Jonathan Capehart of MSNBC. With a hello to you both. Jonathan Capehart: Hey, Geoff. Geoff Bennett: So both Israel and Hamas have agreed to phase one of the peace plan. We see the negotiations there on the screen. And that was followed by today celebrations in Israel and also along the Gaza Strip. I want to start with your reaction to this real breakthrough, Jonathan. Jonathan Capehart: Look, I'm going to say something that I have never said before and that this audience has never heard me say before. Kudos to the president. I think we are at this point because the president was single — he was focused, single-mindedly focused, on getting something, getting a deal done, getting the hostages out. The hard part comes after he leaves the region, after we get past phase one, assuming we get the 20 — that the Israeli hostages released, the 20 who are presumed alive, after the 2,000 Palestinians are released by Israel. Once we get past that, there are so many questions that are still out there that leaves me skeptical that my kudos to the president will maintain. One, will they be able to get Hamas disarmed? Two, will there be a legitimate negotiating partner among the Palestinians for Israel and everyone to negotiate with, an international stabilization force for the area? And also the big thing, sort of Palestinian self-governance, or, in other words, a two-state solution, something that Prime Minister Netanyahu has made clear he's not interested in. And if we're going to get through all these phases of this peace plan, the single-minded focus of the president that got us to this crucial point will be needed for the next 19 phases. And I just don't see how he does that. Geoff Bennett: And given the history of dashed hopes in the region, what gives you hope that this agreement can endure? David Brooks: I got hope when Jonathan praised the president. (Laughter) David Brooks: So I have my fingers crossed he deserves the Nobel Prize. I thought you were going to go there. (Laughter) David Brooks: But it's impressive, what Trump has — did. First, he got together with the Saudis and the Qataris in New York during U.N. week and came up with this 20-point plan. And then he understood how to deal with Netanyahu. And I should say, in fairness, the Trump administration, both the first term and the second term, has been better on the Middle East than the Obama and Biden administration. There's something about that region he sort of gets. And so the way to deal with Biden — the way you deal with Netanyahu is, you show total support for Israel at the same time you're leaning on them. And so I think that the Biden people, when they were always withdrawing and threatening and saying, don't do that, that made Israel feel insecure. And they had to negotiate from a position of security and then they could bend. And so he got Bibi to go against his far right colleagues who wanted to basically annex the Gaza. And there is, like, now a separate Gaza territory, and that's an important achievement. The Qataris are an important role. Why is this little country in the center of all this? Partly because they are part of those Gulf states who wanted to make the Middle East a modern place. And so I think they play just tremendously a constructive role because they seem to talk to everybody. Will it work? I don't know, but there's no choice. There's no solution. Martin Indyk, who died about a year ago, had a piece in ""Foreign Affairs"" called the strange revival, I'm summarizing, of the two-state solution. Everybody wants to give up on the two-state solution. There is no alternative to the two-state solution. And so they're just going to have to stumble their way forward. Are they going to get there? Who knows? We have been covering the Middle East for a long time. They don't get there. But it looks a lot better than I thought it would look six months ago, a year ago, five years ago. Geoff Bennett: Yes. Well, shifting our focus to domestic politics, this past week, we saw former FBI Director James Comey arraigned, we saw New York Attorney General Letitia James indicted, both by the same Trump-appointed prosecutor. The former Trump National Security Adviser turned Trump critic John Bolton could be next, according to reports from MSNBC. And we talked about this last week, when the focus was solely on Comey, but President Trump's campaign of retribution is expanding. Jonathan Capehart: Yes, because this is what he told us he was going to do. The people he — the folks who have been indicted or expected to be indicted soon or on the list, people like Senator Adam Schiff of California, private citizen now Miles Taylor, the president made it clear that he wants something done and he wants his Justice Department to do it. He's on the record as saying they are guilty of something. Pam, go find it, Pam being the attorney general, Pam Bondi. So this is chilling because you now have a Justice Department that is supposed to, at least nominally, be separate and removed from the White House, taking orders from the president of the United States, who famously said, where's my Roy Cohn? Well, his Roy Cohn is named Pam Bondi. Geoff Bennett: David, there are supporters of the president who say that Letitia James ran on a campaign of going after Donald Trump and that this is simply accountability coming full circle, that this is justified reciprocity, to which you would say what? David Brooks: Well, that's how Donald Trump clearly thinks. He thinks they were politically motivated prosecutions. And I somewhat agree with him. I don't think Trump would have been brought up on those charges if he hadn't been Donald Trump. Nonetheless, what matters is the evidence. And Letitia James, she's accused of doing mortgage fraud that would have produced a benefit over the lifetime of the loan of $18,000. Now, you think about the numbers Donald Trump inflated his property values, they were not $18,000. They were times 100 million of that. And so the evidence against Comey is slight. The case against James is — it would have been — no one would have prosecuted. We know that because other prosecutors refused to do it. Jonathan Capehart: Right. David Brooks: And so this is clearly a revenge prosecution. Donald Trump makes it hard on us pundits, because he's so blatant, there's nothing interesting to say. (Laughter) Geoff Bennett: It is kind of all out there in the open. Jonathan Capehart: Right. It's out there. Geoff Bennett: Well, today marks the 10th day of the government shutdown, as we heard from the House Democratic leader. There has still been no substantive talks among the different parties. October 15, I have that day circled on my calendar because that's the day that if they're — if the government is still shut down, members of the military, if things stay the way they are, who have been deemed essential, they have been on the job, they will not get a paycheck. I mean, what do you make of all this at this point? Jonathan Capehart: You know why there aren't talks? Because the Republicans are not in town. The speaker of the House has kept the House out of session now for 20-some — 19 or 20 days and has already said that they're not coming back next week. You would think that the House speaker being on C-SPAN and taking that very emotional call on the Republican line, a woman saying — a military wife talking about the need for, like, the — not only health care, but for the check, for the paycheck, and saying, get — where are you guys? Get back to work. And he pivoted and blamed the Democrats. If they want to change the calculus of this conversation, they being Republicans, they should come back to town, because, if everyone's in town, then there's no excuse. Democrats will be in town in the House, will be in town next week. Why not come back to town and say, you want to talk, let's talk? Geoff Bennett: When even Marjorie Taylor Greene is calling out her own party and saying we need to fix for the Obamacare subsidies, what does that say about the internal dynamics within the GOP? David Brooks: Not much, I don't think. Marjorie Taylor Greene is out there and wherever she is. I think Republicans, like the Democrats, frankly, are pretty unified. And the weird thing about that is usually, when you cover a shutdown, somebody's feeling the heat. Nobody's feeling the heat yet. I don't think… Geoff Bennett: Yes, why is that? David Brooks: I think two things. One, the American people haven't yet felt it. Maybe, if you air travel, you will begin to feel it. When the military doesn't get paid, they feel it. But right now they're not feeling it. I was in Colorado this week, and, believe me, nobody was raising this with me. Nobody talked about it. That may change. Second, the American people have become so jaded and disgusted that they're just like, oh, whatever. And so if you look at the polling, at the beginning, it looked like they were more blaming Trump. But now, if you look at, do you approve of the way Democrats in House and Republicans in Congress, how are they handling it, it's like both get a 28 positive rating, so a low rating on both parties. But it's not really fueling the heat on either of these people. The second thing that I think there's — it's quite easy to cut a deal if the shutdown is really what Hakeem Jeffries said it was, which was about health care premiums. And it is partly about that. And Democrats, of course, are smart to talk that way because it's an issue that polls great for them. But I don't think it's only about that. For a lot of Democrats, it's also about Trump's authoritarianism. It's Trump's willingness to dishonor and disrespect Congress and not spend the money they have appropriated. And that's a much deeper issue that's much harder to resolve, because Donald Trump is not doing that. And then the Trump — the Republicans are also a little divided. Russell Vought did — the RIFs are starting today. There are a lot of congressional Republicans that don't like that. Geoff Bennett: Yes. David Brooks: And so there are these tensions within both parties. But, so far, they — their feet is not to the fire. But that may come in a couple weeks. Geoff Bennett: Well, as the shutdown drags on and more layoff notices keep landing, should Democrats hold the line? Jonathan Capehart: Yes. Yes, because I actually do think that they are pushing on health care because it's something that they care about. And, I mean, I take your point that the American people aren't feeling it writ large. But when you have a Republican calling on the Republican line on C-SPAN to chastise the Republican House speaker — the Republican House speaker, and you have got the poster child for MAGA, who is also saying, you know this premiums thing is an issue, to me, that says that the ground is shifting. And I also agree with David in this. While health care is the overarching, sort of popular issue because it's something that will affect the American people directly, rescissions has been my hobbyhorse, because why would and should Democrats trust any negotiation that they get into with Republicans and that is signed by the president if they know that, once — before the ink is dry, Russell Vought And the president will snatch back the money, snatch back the authority? Geoff Bennett: Jonathan Capehart, David Brooks, our thanks to you both. Jonathan Capehart: Thanks, Geoff.

7086a8421575,WATCH: Trump announces deal with AstraZeneca to lower drug prices for Medicaid,"astrazeneca, donald trump news, drug prices, medicaid, pharmaceutical industry, politics","WASHINGTON (AP) — AstraZeneca on Friday became the second major pharmaceutical manufacturer to announce it had agreed to lower the cost of prescription drugs for Medicaid under a deal struck with the Trump administration that avoided its threats of steep tariffs. Watch the announcement in the video player above. President Donald Trump made the announcement in the Oval Office with AstraZeneca CEO Pascal Soriot, who said that during tough negotiations to reach a deal, Trump and his team of officials had “really kept me up at night.” Under the agreement, AstraZeneca will charge most-favored-nation pricing to Medicaid, while guaranteeing such pricing on newly launched drugs, Trump said. That involves matching the lowest price offered in other developed nations. WATCH: Trump announces Pfizer deal to lower drug prices “For many years, Americans have paid the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs, by far,” Trump said, adding that the new deal may cut prices to “the lowest price anywhere in the world. That’s what we get.” AstraZeneca CEO Pascal Soriot shakes hands with President Donald Trump during an announcement about lowering U.S. drug prices, at the White House in Washington, D.C., Oct. 10, 2025. Photo by Kent Nishimura/Reuters AstraZeneca’s deal follows a similar agreement Pfizer announced late last month. Advocates have generally praised the administration’s efforts to cut drug prices, though some have expressed concerns that too much onus is being placed on the manufacturers to lower costs without implementing U.S. policy safeguards to ensure such outcomes. Both agreements, however, build on an executive order Trump signed in May that set a deadline for drugmakers to electively lower prices or face new limits on what the government will pay. Trump had suggested that a series of deals with drug companies would subsequently be coming. “The tariffs were a big reason he came here,” Trump said of Soriot. Cambridge, United Kingdom-based AstraZeneca makes a range of cancer treatments. Its products include the lung cancer drug Tagrisso; Lynparza, an oral treatment for ovarian cancer, and Calquence, which treats chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Those drugs brought in a total of more than $7.5 billion in U.S. sales last year. AstraZeneca announced Thursday that it would spend $4.5 billion on a new manufacturing plant near Charlottesville, Virginia, and its Republican governor, Glenn Youngkin, spoke during Friday’s Oval Office announcement to cheer groundbreaking on the new facility. The drugmaker said that project was the centerpiece of $50 billion in investments the company plans to make in the U.S. by 2030. AstraZeneca said it plans to reach $80 billion in total revenue by then, half of which will be generated in the United States. Trump predicted the investment’s could lead to 3,600 jobs domestically “just to begin with.” One of the AstraZeneca drugs was already subject to price reductions due to a Medicare negotiating strategy implemented under President Biden. Still, Trump insisted that Democrats shouldn’t “get credit” and suggested the party’s key leaders may try. The announcements came months after AstraZeneca said it was scrapping plans to expand a vaccine manufacturing plant in its home country. The company blamed several factors, including reduced government financial support. The Trump administration has put up a landing page for its new website, TrumpRX.gov, where people will be able to buy drugs directly from manufacturers, according to officials. Both Pfizer and AstraZeneca will offer medications through the site, according to the administration. The website’s landing page features two very large pictures of Trump and a promise that the site is “Coming Soon” in January 2026. It says at the bottom of the page that the site was “Designed in DC by The National Design Studio,” the new government website design hub that Trump created by executive order in August, which is being led by Airbnb co-founder Joe Gebbia.

6261c4327222,Wall Street tumbles in its worst day since April after Trump threatens more tariffs on China,"china, donald trump news, stock markets, tariffs, wall street, economy","NEW YORK (AP) — A monthslong calm on Wall Street shattered Friday, and U.S. stocks tumbled after President Donald Trump threatened to crank tariffs much higher on China. The S&P 500 sank 2.7% in its worst day since April. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 878 points, or 1.9%, and the Nasdaq composite fell 3.6%. Stocks had been heading for a slight gain in the morning, until Trump took to his social media platform and said he’s considering “a massive increase of tariffs” on Chinese imports. He’s upset at restrictions China has placed on exports of its rare earths, which are materials that are critical for the manufacturing of everything from consumer electronics to jet engines. READ MORE: Trump threatens more tariffs after China restricts key exports “We have been contacted by other Countries who are extremely angry at this great Trade hostility, which came out of nowhere,” Trump wrote on Truth Social. He also said “now there seems to be no reason” to meet with China’s leader, Xi Jinping, after earlier agreeing to do so as part of an upcoming trip to South Korea. The ratchet higher in tensions between the world’s largest economies led to widespread drops across Wall Street, with roughly six out of every seven stocks within the S&P 500 falling. Nearly everything weakened, from Big Tech companies like Nvidia and Apple to stocks of smaller companies looking to get past uncertainty about tariffs and trade. The market may have been primed for a slide. U.S. stocks were already facing criticism that their prices had shot too high following the S&P 500’s nearly relentless 35% run from a low in April. The index, which dictates the movements for many 401(k) accounts, is still near its all-time high set earlier in the week. Critics say the market looks too expensive after prices rose much faster than corporate profits. Worries are particularly high about companies in the artificial-intelligence industry, where pessimists see echoes of the 2000 dot-com bubble that imploded. For stocks to look less expensive, either their prices need to fall, or companies’ profits need to rise. Levi Strauss dropped 12.6% for one of the market’s larger losses, even though it reported a stronger profit for the latest quarter than analysts expected. Its forecast for profit over the full year was also within range of Wall Street’s estimates, but the jeans and clothing company could simply be facing the challenge of heightened expectations after a big run. Its stock price came into the day with a surge of nearly 42% for the year so far. All told, the S&P 500 fell 182.60 points to 6,552.51. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 878.82 to 45,479.60, and the Nasdaq composite sank 820.20 to 22,204.43. Some of Friday’s strongest action was in the oil market, where the price of a barrel of benchmark U.S. crude sank 4.2% to $58.90. It fell as a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas came into effect in Gaza. An end to the war could remove worries about disruptions to oil supplies, which had kept crude’s price higher than it otherwise would have been. Losses accelerated following Trump’s tariff threat, which could gum up global trade and lead the economy to burn less fuel. Brent crude, the international standard, dropped 3.8% to $62.73 per barrel. In the bond market, the yield on the 10-year Treasury sank to 4.05% from 4.14% late Thursday. It had already been lower before Trump made his threats, as a report from the University of Michigan suggested that sentiment among U.S. consumers remains in the doldrums. “Pocketbook issues like high prices and weakening job prospects remain at the forefront of consumers’ minds,” according to Joanne Hsu, director of the Surveys of Consumers. “At this time, consumers do not expect meaningful improvement in these factors.” The job market has slowed so much that the Federal Reserve cut its main interest rate last month for the first time this year. Fed officials have penciled in more cuts through next year to give the economy additional breathing room. But Chair Jerome Powell has also said they may change course if inflation stays high. That’s because lower interest rates can push inflation even higher. One potentially encouraging signal from the University of Michigan’s preliminary survey said consumers’ expectations for inflation in the coming year edged down to 4.6% from 4.7% the month before. While that’s still high, the direction of change could help the Fed and limit upward pressure on inflation. In stock markets abroad, indexes fell across much of Europe and Asia. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng fell 1.7%, and France’s CAC 40 dropped 1.5% for two of the bigger moves. But South Korea’s Kospi leaped 1.7% after trading reopened following a holiday.

2560a83cd2ad,MIT president rejects proposal to adopt Trump priorities for funding benefits,"colleges and universities, donald trump news, higher education, massachusetts, massachusetts institute of technology, mit, universities, education","WASHINGTON (AP) — The president of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology said Friday she “cannot support” a White House proposal that asks MIT and eight other universities to adopt President Donald Trump’s political agenda in exchange for favorable access to federal funding. READ MORE: Trump asks 9 colleges to commit to his political agenda for better access to federal money MIT is among the first to express forceful views either in favor of or against an agreement the White House billed as providing “multiple positive benefits,” including “substantial and meaningful federal grants.” Leaders of the University of Texas system said they were honored its flagship university in Austin was invited, but most other campuses have remained silent as they review the document. In a letter to Trump administration officials, MIT President Sally Kornbluth said MIT disagrees with provisions of the proposal, including some that would limit free speech and the university’s independence. She said it’s inconsistent with MIT’s belief that scientific funding should be based on merit alone. “Therefore, with respect, we cannot support the proposed approach to addressing the issues facing higher education,” Kornbluth said in a letter to Education Secretary Linda McMahon and White House officials. The higher education compact circulated last week requires universities to make a wide range of commitments in line with Trump’s political agenda on topics from admissions and women’s sports to free speech and student discipline. The universities were invited to provide “limited, targeted feedback” by Oct. 20 and make a decision no later than Nov. 21. Others that received the 10-page proposal are: Vanderbilt, the University of Pennsylvania, Dartmouth College, the University of Southern California, the University of Arizona, Brown University and the University of Virginia. It was not clear how the schools were selected or why. Colleges have faced mounting pressure to reject the proposal University leaders face immense pressure to reject the compact amid opposition from students, faculty, free speech advocates and higher education groups. Leaders of some other universities have called it extortion. The mayor and city council in Tucson, home of the University of Arizona, formally opposed the compact, calling it an “unacceptable act of federal interference.” Even some conservatives have dismissed the compact as a bad approach. Frederick Hess, director of education policy at the American Enterprise Institute, called it “profoundly problematic” and said the government’s requests are “ungrounded in law.” At the University of Virginia, officials invited campus feedback on the proposal this week. A message from university leaders said it would be “very difficult” to accept certain terms of the arrangement and said the decision will be guided by “principles of academic freedom and free inquiry.” READ MORE: How Trump’s college crackdown is raising concerns about free speech and academic freedom Democrats in the Virginia Senate threatened to cut the university’s funding if it signed the deal. In a letter to the university’s leaders on Tuesday, top Democrats called the compact a trap and said the state would not “subsidize an institution that has ceded its independence to federal political control.” California Gov. Gavin Newsom, a Democrat, issued a similar ultimatum to USC last week. At Brown, which already struck an agreement with the White House in July to resolve a series of investigations, university president Christina H. Paxson said Friday she is seeking campus input to decide how or whether to respond to the new proposal. The compact marks a new tactic to seek reforms In its letter to universities, the administration said the compact would strengthen and renew the “mutually beneficial relationship” between universities and the government. That bond faces unprecedented strain as the White House cuts billions of dollars in research funding from campuses it accuses of antisemitism and liberal bias. The compact is a proactive attempt at reform even as the government continues enforcement through other means, the letter said. The nine universities were invited to become “initial signatories.” Kornbluth’s letter did not explicitly decline the compact but suggested that its terms are unworkable. Still, she said MIT is already aligned with some of the values outlined in the deal, including prioritizing merit in admissions and making college more affordable. RED MORE: Critics say Trump’s push for fairness in college admissions is leaving out legacy preferences Kornbluth said MIT was the first to reinstate requirements for standardized admissions tests after the COVID-19 pandemic and admits students based on their talent, ideas and hard work. Incoming undergraduates whose families earn less than $200,000 a year pay nothing for tuition, she added. “We freely choose these values because they’re right, and we live by them because they support our mission,” Kornbluth wrote. As part of the compact, the White House asked universities to freeze tuition for U.S. students for five years. Those with endowments exceeding $2 million per undergraduate could not charge tuition at all for students pursuing “hard science” programs. It asked colleges to require the SAT or ACT for all undergraduate applicants and to eliminate race, sex and other characteristics from admissions decisions. Schools that sign on would also have to accept the government’s binary definition of gender and apply it to campus bathrooms and sports teams. Much of the compact centers on promoting conservative viewpoints. To make campuses a “vibrant marketplace of ideas” campuses would commit to taking steps including “transforming or abolishing institutional units that purposefully punish, belittle, and even spark violence against conservative ideas.” A free press is a cornerstone of a healthy democracy.

Kennedy, Jr. Thursday reasserted the unproven link between the pain reliever Tylenol and autism , and suggested people who opposed the theory were motivated by hatred for President Donald Trump. During a meeting with Trump and the Cabinet , Kennedy reiterated the connection, even while noting there was no medical proof to substantiate the claim. He also mistakenly described a pregnant woman’s anatomy and linked autism to circumcision. READ MORE: Here’s what we know about the causes of autism “Anybody who takes the stuff during pregnancy unless they have to is, is irresponsible,” Kennedy told Trump and fellow Cabinet members. “It is not proof. We’re doing the studies to make the proof.” Kennedy has long espoused unconventional beliefs about public health, which have prompted concern among medical experts that, as health secretary, he could upend the country’s evidence-based health policies. VIDEO Kennedy noted during the meeting that he had seen a TikTok video on Thursday, which he said featured a pregnant woman “gobbling Tylenol” and cursing Trump. “The level of Trump derangement syndrome has now left the political landscape and now in the realm of pathology,” he said. Kennedy also said the woman was taking Tylenol “with a baby in her placenta.” READ MORE: WHO urges caution on autism and acetaminophen claims, saying several studies ‘found no such relationship’ A fetus develops in the uterus, not the placenta. The placenta is a temporary organ that develops in the uterus during pregnancy and provides oxygen, nutrients, and hormones to the growing fetus. Kennedy’s statement came two weeks after he stood with Trump in the White House as the president used his office to promote unproven and, in some cases, discredited ties between Tylenol, vaccines and autism. Kennedy also said Thursday that infant boys who are circumcised have double the rate of autism because they are given Tylenol after the procedure. READ MORE: 12 ways RFK Jr. has undercut vaccine confidence as health secretary This claim seems to refer to a study in the Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine from 2015, which looked at ritual circumcision and the risk of autism spectrum disorder in boys under the age of 10 in Denmark. It found that those who had undergone the procedure, which involves the removal of the foreskin from the penis, were more likely to develop autism than other boys in the study. Researchers suggested a potential link might be due to the pain of the procedure. Researchers noted that they had no data on painkillers or anesthetics used, and thus couldn’t address whether Tylenol was linked to autism. Other researchers pointed out that the Denmark study looked at correlation, not causation. They also point to other studies that found no evidence to support a link between circumcision and autism.

The Republican president suggested that he was looking at a “massive increase” of import taxes on Chinese products in response to Xi’s moves. It’s possible that could amount to either posturing by the United States for eventual negotiations or a retaliatory step that could foster new fears about the stability of the global economy. WATCH: Trump considers $10 billion bailout for farmers as tariffs disrupt the market “One of the Policies that we are calculating at this moment is a massive increase of Tariffs on Chinese products coming into the United States of America,” Trump posted on his Truth Social platform. “There are many other countermeasures that are, likewise, under serious consideration.” The United States and China have been jostling for advantage in trade talks, after the import taxes announced earlier this year triggered a trade war between the world’s two largest economies. Both nations agreed to ratchet down tariffs after negotiations in Switzerland and the United Kingdom, yet tensions remain as China has sought to restrict America’s access to the difficult-to-mine rare earth’s needed for a wide array of U.S. technologies. Trump did not formally cancel the meeting with Xi, so much as indicate that it might not happen as part of a trip at the end of the month in Asia. The trip was scheduled to include a stop in Malaysia, which is hosting the Association of Southeast Asian Nations summit; a stop in Japan; and a visit to South Korea, where he was slated to meet with Xi ahead of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit.

China’s new restrictions On Thursday, the Chinese government restricted access to the rare earths ahead of the scheduled Trump-Xi meeting. Beijing would require foreign companies to get special approval for shipping the metallic elements aboard. It also announced permitting requirements on exports of technologies used in the mining, smelting and recycling of rare earths, adding that any export requests for products used in military goods would be rejected. Trump said that China is “becoming very hostile” and that it’s holding the world “captive” by restricting access to the metals and magnets used in electronics, computer chips, lasers, jet engines and other technologies.

The U.S. president said the move on rare earths was “especially inappropriate” given the announcement of a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas in Gaza so that the remaining hostages from Hamas’ Oct. 7, 2023, attack can be released. He raised the possibility without evidence that China was trying to steal the moment from him for his role in the ceasefire, saying on social media, “I wonder if that timing was coincidental?” Trump’s trade war The outbreak of a tariff-fueled trade war between the U.S. and China initially caused the world economy to shudder over the possibility of global commerce collapsing. Trump imposed tariffs totaling 145% on Chinese goods, with China responding with import taxes of 125% on American products. The taxes were so high as to effectively be a blockade on trade between the countries. That led to negotiations that reduced the tariff charged by the U.S. government to 30% and the rate imposed by China to 10% so that further talks could take place. But differences continue over America’s access to rare earths from China, U.S. restrictions on China’s ability to import advanced computer chips, sales of American-grown soybeans and a series of tit-for-tat port fees being levied by both countries starting on Tuesday. WATCH: China cuts exports of vital rare earth minerals as trade war with U.S. intensifies There is already a backlog of export license applications from Beijing’s previous round of export controls on rare earth elements, and the latest announcements “add further complexity to the global supply chain of rare earth elements,” the European Union Chamber of Commerce in China said in a statement. Just what Trump’s threat meant was open to interpretation, as it could simply be an attempt to gain some leverage under the belief that China has overplayed its hand or an ominous sign of trade tensions leading to potentially destructive increase in tariff rates. How analysts see moves by U.S. and China Cole McFaul, a research fellow at Georgetown University’s Center for Security and Emerging Technology, said that Trump appeared in his post to be readying for talks on the possibility that China had overplayed its hand. By contrast, China sees itself as having come out ahead when the two countries have engaged in talks. “From Beijing’s point of view, they’re in a moment where they’re feeling a lot of confidence about their ability to handle the Trump administration,” McFaul said. “Their impression is they’ve come to the negotiating table and extracted key concessions.” Craig Singleton, senior director of the China program at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, a think tank, said Trump’s post could “mark the beginning of the end of the tariff truce” that had lowered the tax rates charged by both countries. It’s still unclear how Trump intends to follow through on his threats and how China plans to respond. “But the risk is clear: Mutually assured disruption between the two sides is no longer a metaphor,” Singleton said. “Both sides are reaching for their economic weapons at the same time, and neither seems willing to back down.” A free press is a cornerstone of a healthy democracy.
