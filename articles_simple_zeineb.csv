Published On 15 Oct 2025 15 Oct 2025 Click here to share on social media share2 Share The European Commission and Spain’s government have dismissed US President Donald Trump’s latest threat to impose higher tariffs on Madrid over its refusal to meet his proposed NATO target for defence spending. Trump said on Tuesday that he was “very unhappy” with Spain for being the only NATO member to reject the new spending objective of 5 percent of economic output , adding that he was considering punishing the Mediterranean country. Recommended Stories list of 3 items end of list “I was thinking of giving them trade punishment through tariffs because of what they did, and I think I may do that,” Trump added. He had previously suggested making Spain “pay twice as much” in trade talks. Trade policy falls under the remit of Brussels, and the European Commission would “respond appropriately, as we always do, to any measures taken against one or more of our member states”, commission spokesperson Olof Gill said in a press briefing on Wednesday. The trade deal between the European Union and the United States signed in July was the right platform to address any issues, Gill added. “The defence spending debate is not about increasing spending for the sake of increasing it, but about responding to real threats,” Spain’s Economy and Trade Ministry said in a statement. “We’re doing our part to develop the necessary capabilities and contribute to the collective defence of our allies.” Spain has more than doubled nominal defence spending from 0.98 percent of gross domestic product in 2017 to 2 percent this year, equivalent to about 32.7bn euros ($38bn). Defence Minister Margarita Robles said allies weren’t discussing the 5 percent target for 2035 in Wednesday’s meeting because they were prioritising the present situation in Ukraine, but wouldn’t completely rule out a shift in Spain’s position. Targeted tariffs by the US against individual EU member states are rare, but there are precedents, said Ignacio Garcia Bercero, a senior fellow at the Brussels-based economic think tank Bruegel. In 1999, the US hit the EU with 100 percent punitive tariffs on products such as chocolate, pork, onions and truffles in retaliation for an EU import ban on hormone-treated beef. But those tariffs excluded Britain, which at the time was still a member of the trade bloc. The US could impose anti-dumping penalties on European products that are mostly produced in Spain, said Juan Carlos Martinez Lazaro, professor at Madrid’s IE business school. In 2018, Washington imposed a combination of duties of more than 30 percent on Spanish black table olives at the request of Californian olive growers. Spain’s share of the US market plummeted from 49 percent in 2017 to 19 percent in 2024. Another option would be moving the naval and air bases the US has in southern Spain to Morocco – an idea floated by former Trump official Robert Greenway – which would damage the local economies through the loss of thousands of indirect jobs.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/15/eu-spain-reject-trumps-us-tariff-threats-over-nato-spending,World,aljazeera.com,,https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2025-10-13T173229Z_2000144429_RC25BHAYZC5A_RTRMADP_3_ISRAEL-PALESTINIANS-EGYPT-SUMMIT-1760546340.jpg?resize=1920%2C1440,,56e0659ac6626c03161af1b319d26b501b49abf3
4e11ea9068de,Raila Odinga: The symbol and symptom of Kenya’s political tragedy,"opinions, africa, kenya","By Patrick Gathara Senior Editor for Inclusive Storytelling at The New Humanitarian. Published On 15 Oct 2025 15 Oct 2025 Click here to share on social media share2 Share Kenyans are wont to refer to Raila Odinga , the long-reigning 80-year-old opposition leader who died on Wednesday, as the “Enigma of Kenyan politics,” a reference to the title of a 2006 biography of him penned by the Nigerian author, Babafemi Badejo. His unequalled ability to survive, even thrive, at the top of the country’s political landscape for decades confounded his rivals and inflicted headaches on the regimes he plagued. But I think he would be best remembered as more mirror than mystery: the personification of Kenya’s tragedy. The son of Kenya’s first vice president, he carved out a path as a crusader for freedom and better governance that led him from the country’s prisons and torture chambers to some of the highest political offices in the land. But at the end of his life, the compromises he had made to get there, the handshakes that peppered his career, had taken their toll, with a new generation shunning him, considering him part of the problem. Throughout his long career, he was inseparable from the fight for a better Kenya. From the struggle for the restoration of multiparty democracy in the 1990s to the 25-year battle for a new constitution, he was never far from the limelight. Few could match his ability to mobilise Kenyans or the sway he held over his supporters. Despite believing Kenya needed to ditch its presidential system for a parliamentary one, a position he argued vociferously during the constitutional conference in 2003, he ran for president in every election since 1997 with the exception of the 2002 one, when his proclamation of “Kibaki Tosha” was sufficient to propel Mwai Kibaki to the office. He was a man Kenya seemed content to celebrate but determined to frustrate. He was arguably robbed of the presidency on at least two, perhaps three, of those attempts, in 2007, 2013 and 2017. His refusal to meekly accept the injustice led to his opponents, and even The New York Times, branding him “a perennial loser”. His resort to the street as an avenue to protest not just the electoral controversies, but terrible state policies, also led to accusations of being a dangerous instigator of political violence, though in truth, the violence associated with Kenyan political demonstrations almost always comes from the state. However, it is also important to recall that for all his legendary contributions and deeply held beliefs, he was prone to startling bouts of hypocrisy. It is a potent illustration of how power in Kenya corrupts even its greatest reformers. In 2000, after his handshake with the dictatorship of Daniel arap Moi, which would eventually see him appointed to his cabinet, he called for his erstwhile comrades in the opposition to be charged with treason for holding unauthorised antigovernment rallies. In 2006 he boasted that, as part of the Rainbow Coalition that had ended Moi’s KANU party’s grip on power, he had blocked action by the Kibaki administration to hold the dictator accountable for some of the looting that had happened during his 24 years in power. In early 2008, the standoff between him and Kibaki over the bungled December 2007 presidential election would cost 1,300 Kenyans their lives and see hundreds of thousands displaced. Yet a few months later, following yet another handshake resulting in Raila becoming only the second person in Kenya’s history to be appointed prime minister, his family and close associates were implicated in a maize subsidy scam that left a third of the country starving. For his reputation, the straw that broke the camel’s back was his infamous 2018 handshake with President Uhuru Kenyatta, which again came after the state’s violent repression following the historic annulment of the 2017 presidential election. It was widely seen as a betrayal of his supporters, more than 70 of whom had been murdered by security forces while protesting the hasty repeat election, which Raila boycotted, and its aftermath. Following that, though he still had enough in the tank for a final run at the presidency, he was largely a spent force. His challenge to the William Ruto regime in the latter part of 2022 and into 2023 was a pale shadow of the protests he had commanded in previous years and was eclipsed by the Gen Z uprising a year later. Raila’s life epitomised both the promise and disappointment of Kenya, which was born in struggle, nurtured in hope and ruined by betrayal. The true tragedy, however, lies not in his compromises, but in a system that made, and continues to make, integrity nearly impossible. Despite his tremendous achievements which made him stand out among his contemporaries, not just in Kenya but across the continent and the globe, his trajectory sadly traced a path that too many of Kenya’s – and Africa’s – most promising politicians have walked. His death is a big blow to the country, and he will undoubtedly be remembered fondly by many. But perhaps it should also be with a tinge of sadness and anger for what could have been but for Kenya itself.

7f2603103c19,Denial and amnesia: Is the global community ready to welcome Israel back?,"features, news, benjamin netanyahu, donald trump, european union, israel-palestine conflict, europe, israel, middle east, palestine","In both Israel and among its Western allies, the Gaza ceasefire deal is seen as an opportunity – to move on from the accusations of genocide against it, and to restore close relations weakened as a result of public anger. Over two years of its unrelenting war on Gaza, Israel has killed more than 67,900 Palestinians and injured more than 170,000. It has destroyed or damaged 92 percent of the enclave’s residential housing and its actions in blockading Gaza have led to a famine being declared. Recommended Stories list of 3 items end of list Rights groups, international bodies, and organisations from within Israel, such as B’Tselem and Physicians for Human Rights Israel (PHRI), have concluded that the country’s actions amount to genocide: a view confirmed by a UN commission of inquiry in September. By that month , criticism of Israel’s war had reached near consensus across Europe, and millions attended protests against Israel’s actions in world capitals every weekend. However, marking the ceasefire in the Israeli Knesset on Tuesday, opposition leader Yair Lapid told lawmakers, including United States President Donald Trump: “Those who demonstrated against Israel in London, Rome, Paris … were deceived by propaganda … The truth is, there was no genocide, no intentional starvation.” Denial “There is a relatively strong consensus that outside criticism must be dismissed as unjust,” former Israeli government adviser Daniel Levy told Al Jazeera. “This dismissal has been central to manufacturing societal consent for genocide: relentless media mobilisation around the war, coupled with rejection of criticism.” “This pattern is consistent across almost the entire Zionist political spectrum, save for a small dissident cohort,” he said of the various groups within Israel which opposed the war from the outset. Across Israel, there remains a refusal to accept the scale of the devastation their war has visited on Gaza, the lives destroyed, and the people – including children – pushed into famine as a consequence of government policies. According to observers from within Israel, no public reckoning with the human cost of its war looks likely. Without acceptance of that cost, a resumption of hostilities – whatever the international consensus may be – remains possible. “It’s not as if there’s just no awareness of the genocide in Israel,” Guy Shalev of PHRI told Al Jazeera. “There isn’t even an awareness of the suffering or widespread destruction of Gaza. “A lot of the conversation is still fixed on [false allegations of] faked footage [of starving children or other potential war crimes] and how it’s all Hamas’s fault,” said Shalev. “Many of us aren’t even living in the same reality. My family and I aren’t even living in the same reality. We can’t agree on what truth is and, until that happens, there can never be accountability, and all of this could happen again.” Some in Israel are hoping for just that. Reacting to news of the impending ceasefire over the weekend, Israel’s hardline National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir branded the agreement a “national defeat” and “eternal disgrace”. Others, such as Amit Halevi, a member of the Israeli parliament representing Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s Likud party, went further, saying Israel should have declared “to Hamas and to the whole world that the Jewish people will not forget or forgive until the complete annihilation of the neo-Nazis in Gaza and the restoration of Israeli control over this strip of our homeland”. International amnesia Many in the West already appear to be rushing to accept the ceasefire and US assurances of “everlasting peace” at face value. Earlier this month, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz said he saw no reason for Germans to continue protesting against Israel now that the ceasefire had been reached. On Wednesday, some of the country’s most senior politicians called upon him to resume arms exports to the country, despite the continued death toll in Gaza, and Israel’s illegal occupation of Palestinian territory. On Monday, Israel’s new ambassador to the EU, Avi Nir-Feldklein, suggested that the US might allow the EU to participate in Gaza’s reconstruction if the EU would just “clear the table of what is hanging above our relationship”, he said of the potential sanctions the bloc is considering against Israel. An aerial view shows the extensive destruction in southern Gaza’s Khan Younis following the implementation of a ceasefire and the withdrawal of Israeli forces on October 15, 2025 [Muhammed Eslayeh/Anadolu] In both sport and culture, potential bans on Israel’s participation by the Union of European Football Associations (UEFA) and Eurovision are reported to be in doubt following the US-imposed ceasefire. “Israel is eager to normalise relations with Europe and its other Western allies,” Levy said. “The current narrative [in Israel] emphasises that, with the ceasefire, Israel is no longer isolating itself, that Hamas is contained, and that international opinion has swung in its favour.” “In many respects, Israel and the Western political establishment share this goal of quieting public dissent,” he said, before noting that while Western governments may be eager for rapprochement, their publics may not. “The cultural and public zeitgeist has shifted. Increasingly, people will not accept the narrative that ‘everything is fine’ or that government complicity in structural violence and genocide is acceptable.” Toleration of violence With no drastic reappraisal of Israel’s internal policies towards Palestinians or the occupied West Bank likely, analysts such as Royal United Services Institute’s HA Hellyer suggested that lawmakers in the West and beyond may be preparing for a return to relations similar to the period following the Oslo Accords in the 1990s. The accords were supposed to eventually bring about a Palestinian state, but as Israeli intransigence made that increasingly unlikely in the years that followed, Western rhetoric shifted from claiming outright support for the two-state solution to supporting the process towards it. “I think we can see a similar phase ahead,” Hellyer said, “as long as the violence is below a certain level, it will be acceptable.” Displaced Palestinians, including children, returning to their homes after the ceasefire agreement walk among the destroyed buildings in the Israeli attacks on October 12, 2025, in the Sabra neighbourhood in southern Gaza City, Gaza [Khames Alrefi/Anadolu] “For now, the focus will be moving rubble and rebuilding; not on the fact that half of Gaza remains off-limits to all Palestinians apart from collaborators and the other half remains under occupation,” he told Al Jazeera from Washington. However, while lawmakers – wary of US pressure and, for some, their own country’s potential complicity in Israel’s genocide – may be eager for a return to pre-war detente, among the public, especially the young, two years of carnage in Gaza have produced a seismic shift. “Public attitudes have changed,” Levy said. “More and more people are refusing to accept the story that ‘everything is fine’ or that government complicity in systemic violence and atrocities is acceptable. “The reality on the ground – Israel’s ongoing dehumanisation of Palestinians, its structural violence, and harsh occupation – gives people plenty of reason to speak out.” However, for the remaining population of Gaza, still suffering from hunger and Israeli attacks, the implications of any international rehabilitation of Israel carries far more immediate consequences. “People will move on, not just in Israel, but for the many states who weren’t too concerned about the genocide or want to avoid questions over their complicity in it,” Shalev said. “It’s not only that that’s immoral,” he added, “it just doesn’t work. The victims are not going to just walk away. Organisations such as ours, or anyone who cares about humanity isn’t going to walk away. The victims can’t forget.”",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/15/denial-and-amnesia-is-the-global-community-ready-to-welcome-israel-back,World,aljazeera.com,Simon Speakman Cordall,https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/reuters_68ecdbe3-1760353251.jpg?resize=1920%2C1440,,92cd6dfad369b624d08b4f2d1188f84ddcf18bba

CEO Tim Cook said on Wednesday that the tech giant told China’s industry minister, Li Lecheng, the iPhone maker will keep investing in China, according to an official summary of their meeting in Beijing released by the Chinese government. Recommended Stories list of 4 items end of list The report gave no details of the size of the potential investment. Many US companies have become cautious about relations with China as the world’s two biggest economies clash over tariffs and as United States President Donald Trump seeks to promote manufacturing in the US rather than elsewhere. The California-based company, which has also made investment pledges to Washington, DC, has so far remained relatively unscathed by the trade war between the US and China. Other companies, such as Nvidia and Qualcomm, have found themselves the target of Chinese investigations. Washington has long placed sanctions on Chinese companies, such as Huawei. A Shanghai-based government affairs consultant, who requested anonymity because he was not authorised to speak with the media, said US companies are wary of angering a White House that could hurt them at home in the world’s biggest consumer market for appearing too pro-China, the Reuters news agency reported. At the same time, they are seeking to avoid appearing insincere in Beijing, where they have pledged to be “in China, for China”, he added. In August, Cook presented Trump with a custom US-made plaque mounted on a 24-carat gold stand commemorating Apple’s “American Manufacturing Program”, after saying it would invest an additional $100bn in domestic manufacturing. “This may place Apple in the crosshairs of President Trump and his policies, but given Apple’s operations, it is possible that this move was pre-approved by the administration. These vague announcements may also be purely a public relations tactic rather than anything meaningful, given that tangible investments were never presented to the public,” Babak Hafezi, chief executive officer at Hafezi Capital, an international consulting firm, told Al Jazeera. When Cook visited China in March, Apple made public its plans for a new clean energy fund there worth $101m (720 million yuan). Meanwhile, Apple, which relies on suppliers and factories in China where most of its iPhones are assembled, has been trying to shift some manufacturing capacity to India. “India was a tactic to diversify its supply chain production, increase redundancy, and mitigate geopolitical risk,” Hafezi said. Apple’s COO Sabih Khan on Tuesday visited Lens Technology, a Chinese glass supplier for Apple, the Changsha-based company said in a statement on Wednesday. Lens Technology produces glass covers for Apple products, including the iPhone and Apple Watch, and has been a partner for 19 years, it said. China hopes Apple will continue to explore the Chinese market and grow together with Chinese suppliers, Industry Minister Li Lecheng, who is also in charge of infotech, told Cook, adding that China would continue to foster a good business environment for foreign companies, including Apple. Growth in China Apple’s shipments in China grew 0.6 percent from a year earlier to 10.8 million units in the third quarter against the backdrop of sluggish demand in China’s smartphone market, according to data research firm IDC on Wednesday. Boosted by the iPhone 17 series, it was the only brand among China’s three biggest vendors to achieve growth in shipments during the period. As part of his visit to China this week, Cook visited Apple’s store in Shanghai and met Chinese game developers and the designer of the popular Labubu dolls, he said in posts on China’s X-like Weibo. On Monday, he said the iPhone Air would be available for pre-order in China after the industry ministry cleared the way for major telecom operators to support its eSIM functionality. “The business community has always been a stabiliser of China-US relations and a promoter of pragmatic cooperation,” China’s ambassador to the US, Xie Feng, said during an event in Washington on Tuesday. Many US companies have “chosen China” and are benefiting both countries, Xie added. On Wall Street, Apple’s stock is trending upwards. As of 11:30am in New York (15:30 GMT), it is up by about 1 percent. The latest comments come amid increasing tensions between Washington and Beijing this week. On Wednesday, US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told reporters the US is ready to impose new tariffs over its purchase of Russian oil. Also, US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer weighed in on China’s expansion of rare earth mineral export controls. Greer called it a complete repudiation of US-Chinese trade agreements over the past six months, fueling concerns of a setback in trade talks.",https://www.aljazeera.com/economy/2025/10/15/apple-to-increase-chinese-investments-amid-us-china-trade-tension,World,aljazeera.com,,https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2025-09-19T015217Z_1712157634_RC2OUGAM1SL1_RTRMADP_3_APPLE-CHINA-1760542807.jpg?resize=1920%2C1440,,5a95a0ca27d22689887155d50ed896e0c81220b3

Recommended Stories list of 3 items end of list After weeks of tense antigovernment protests – and a crackdown that turned deadly – fear has become instinct, Ramarimanana said. People ran, tripping over their jerrycans, scattering them across the street. “I picked mine up and ran, too. I was scared.” The 22-year-old student returned home, but she went back “angry”, she said, frustrated by the years of severe power and water supply cuts, sometimes lasting for days at a time, and the government’s failure to deliver improvements to such services. She never made it to church. But later on Sunday she decided to join a bustling protest march in nearby Independence Square. “How can they expect us to stay silent?” she asked from the square, holding a yellow jerrycan and small tin-can lamp – “jiro-kapoaka” – items that have become symbols of resistance among the youth protesters. “We fetch water in the dark, we sleep through power cuts, and they tell us to be patient? For how long?” Since September 25, hundreds of protesters led by the “Gen Z Madagascar” youth movement have been taking to the streets of Antananarivo. What began as anger about the persistent water and power cuts soon led to general discontent and calls for President Andry Rajoelina to step down. For weeks, angry demonstrators blocked roads with burning tyres and rocks, and in response, police fired rubber bullets, stun grenades, and tear gas. At least 22 people have died and dozens of others have been injured, the United Nations says. Faced with mounting unrest, Rajoelina did attempt some changes last month, dissolving his government and promising to appoint a new prime minister. But delays, plus Rajoelina’s choice of a military general, sparked backlash among the youth who saw the appointment as a sign that the same political cycle was simply restarting in a different uniform. This all culminated in the weekend’s protests, which were the largest recorded in the weeks of unrest – and where police once again cracked down. A student in Antananarivo carries water in a jerrycan before participating in a demonstration against frequent power outages and water shortages, in Madagascar, on September 30 [Zo Andrianjafy/Reuters] ‘It’s about survival’ Jose Raharimino is not a regular protester, nor does he see himself as political. But when the power cut out at his apartment on Sunday morning, he decided to make his way to Independence Square. “I just wanted to document what’s happening,” the 31-year-old freelance photographer told Al Jazeera, a camera slung over his shoulder and a jerrycan at his feet. “At first, I thought I’d stay on the sidelines – just watch, maybe take a few photos.” On Saturday, an elite army unit once allied to the president, CAPSAT, defected and declared it would join forces with the protesters against the government. As a result, the atmosphere felt almost hopeful early on Sunday – chants rising, people laughing nervously, the smell of fried “mofo gasy”, Malagasy local donut, from a nearby stall. “We weren’t angry yet. We were desperate, but it felt like we were together in that desperation,” Raharimino said. As the sun climbed higher, he began livestreaming on his phone. “I wanted people abroad to see this – that we’re not violent, just tired.” Around him, the crowd swelled: vendors, students, office clerks, mothers balancing babies and jerrycans. “This isn’t political,” he told someone beside him. “It’s about survival.” But hope turned brittle when the first canister landed. The hiss of tear gas cut through the chants. “At first, people didn’t move,” Raharimino said. “Then another one fell – and another.” He watched as smoke spread through the crowd, stinging his eyes, his camera shaking in his hands. He backed away, coughing, but refused to stop filming. “You could hear people screaming – not from pain, but from anger,” he said. “Someone near me yelled, ‘Why are you shooting at us? We only came for water!’” Moments later, the police line advanced. Protesters scattered through side streets, clutching jerrycans, hiding behind walls. Raharimino ducked behind a kiosk, helping a young man rinse his face with bottled water. “It felt like 2009 all over again,” he said quietly, recalling the weeks of antigovernment protests that eventually led to Rajoelina taking power from democratically elected then-President Marc Ravalomanana through a military coup. Sixteen years later, the military and government were in another standoff – with CAPSAT, which once helped Rajoelina take power, now helping see him out as its members squared off against forces loyal to the president. Among the hundreds of people at the march on Sunday, some had been out in the streets for weeks, while others were newly emboldened by CAPSAT’s announcement. Rajoelina, however, called the army’s move an illegal coup attempt and fled to an unknown location. By Tuesday , parliament voted to impeach him for desertion of duty. Meanwhile, the military has now taken power, forming a transitional committee with the promise to quickly restore civilian rule in Madagascar. Henintsoa Andriniaina documented the protests in Antananarivo [Govina Damy/Al Jazeera] ‘We need a new system’ The rapid changes came with celebrations in the streets, and pictures of soldiers united with ordinary citizens in the hope of building a better country. But just below the surface optimism, many are still worried. “I can’t just watch things stay the same any more. We’ve been stuck with the same problems for too long – corruption, poverty, no jobs, and no real change,” Henintsoa Andriniaina, 24, told Al Jazeera in Independence Square. The entrepreneur from Isotry sells hand-painted tote bags online. His business depends on electricity – something he now calls “a luxury.” “When there’s no power, I can’t print, I can’t sew, I can’t even charge my phone to post new designs. And when there’s no water, I can’t even wash my brushes,” he said. “We’re not lazy youth shouting slogans. We’re people trying to live.” He joined Sunday’s protest with a sign reading “Miala Rajoelina! Mila rafitra vaovao! Tsimbazaza miray!” – which means “Rajoelina out! We need a new system. Tsimbazaza united.” “When I wrote that, I wasn’t just asking one person to step down – I was speaking for everyone who’s tired of this cycle,” he said. “‘Mila rafitra vaovao’ means we need to rebuild from the ground up: new structures, fairer leadership, and a system that truly serves the people. ‘Tsimbazaza miray’ represents unity – the youth, the workers, the vendors – everyone standing together for change. “I’m not here for violence or revenge. I’m here because I believe Madagascar can do better if we dare to change the structure itself, not just the faces in power.” Andriniaina thinks structural reform and accountability are essential. “We need leaders who serve, not steal,” he said. “Change means building systems that outlast people – transparent budgets, fair opportunities, and power that belongs to citizens, not to offices.” A member of the military looks on near a banner featuring a Malagasy version of the logo of the popular Japanese manga One Piece, a symbol adopted by Gen Z protest movements worldwide, as he leaves after joining protesters gathered outside the town hall on Independence Avenue during a nationwide youth-led demonstration against frequent power outages and water shortages, in Antananarivo, Madagascar, October 14, 2025 [Siphiwe Sibeko/Reuters] ‘Uncertain’ future In the middle of Sunday’s police clampdown, Raharimino captured what he could on camera before police seized his phone. The square had turned into a haze of smoke, sirens, and chaos by early afternoon, which reminded him of the 2009 protests. “I was a teenager then. I remember the fear,” he said. Hours later, he made it home with red eyes and shaking hands. “This isn’t about politics,” he repeated. “It’s about the right to live with dignity. The right to wake up and know the lights will turn on.” Raharimino believes that truth and visibility are critical for change. “If we can’t speak, record, or show what’s happening, nothing will change,” he said. “Change begins when truth can flow as freely as water – without fear, without silence.” In the shadow of a closed grocery stall in the capital sat Bako, a 56-year-old street cleaner who only goes by one name. She was not part of the march, but watched from a distance as the smoke from burning tyres drifted across the skyline of Antananarivo. “I’ve seen this before,” she said softly, her voice breaking. “In 2009, we shouted, too. My husband went to the protests. He never came back.” Her eyes filled with tears as she pointed in the direction of the stadium. “Now, it’s the children of those who shouted before. And they’re crying again.” Bako wiped her cheeks with the back of her hand. “I don’t blame them. I cry for them. Because they want what I wanted too – just a little dignity.” As the day faded, the echoes of gunfire mixed with chants and the hum of generators sputtering to life in the distance. By nightfall, dozens had been arrested. Rumours swirled across the capital – of resignations, of tanks near the palace. By Monday morning, it was confirmed: President Rajoelina had resigned. The military had taken over. Some called it liberation. Others, a dangerous replay of history. “What happens next is uncertain,” Luke Freeman, Madagascar expert at University College London, told Al Jazeera. “As far as the Gen Z protesters, who’ve set this ball rolling, it might well be that their egalitarian structure now plays against them because, in order to have political penetration, to get a seat at those discussions for setting out the roadmap for Madagascar’s future, they’re probably going to need to appoint leaders and spokespeople,” he said. “They’re going from social human rights protests into the murky and dirty world of political negotiations. And for that, you need to be part of a coalition, and that’s where they’re going to have to fight for their right to still be part of this process.” For young people in the streets, a better country with functional water and electricity services is “our right, not a plea”, Ramarimanana said. Whether the military’s takeover will bring positive change remains to be seen. But for Ramarimanana, it was neither a full victory nor relief, as it has not yet brought dignity. “We can’t dream of democracy if we can’t drink clean water. Change starts when every home has what it needs – not promises, but pipes that work and lights that stay on,” she said. On the streets of Antananarivo, littered with the symbols of both defiance and despair, Ramarimanana looked down at her scuffed yellow jerrycan, still empty and waiting to be filled. “We didn’t want power. We wanted water. We wanted light,” she said quietly. “Maybe now, they’ll listen. Or maybe … they’ll just forget us again.” A drone view shows protesters gathering outside the town hall on Independence Avenue during a nationwide youth-led demonstration in Antananarivo, October 14, 2025 [Siphiwe Sibeko/Reuters]",https://www.aljazeera.com/features/2025/10/15/we-dont-want-power-we-want-lights-madagascar-awaits-post-rajoelina-era,World,aljazeera.com,,https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/AP25287518287411-1760530078.jpg?resize=1920%2C1440,,198cc4df60ad577d69614bd77c4057006898322a

43321928ee75,Why has the US arrested Indian-American analyst Ashley Tellis?,"news, crime, espionage, explainer, government, politics, asia, asia pacific, china, india, united states, us & canada","Ashley Tellis, a United States government adviser and expert on India-US relations, has been arrested and charged with unlawfully retaining national defence information and allegedly meeting with Chinese officials, US prosecutors said on Tuesday. Tellis made his initial court appearance on Tuesday. A detention hearing is scheduled for October 21, US media reported. “We are fully focused on protecting the American people from all threats, foreign and domestic. The charges as alleged in this case represent a grave risk to the safety and security of our citizens,” said US District Attorney for Eastern Virginia Lindsey Halligan, who was appointed by US President Donald Trump. So who is Tellis, what is he accused of, and what punishment could he face? Who is Ashley Tellis? Tellis, 64, is a naturalised US citizen who was born in India. He is a well-known academic who has written and commented extensively on India-US relations. He specialises in international security, defence and Asian strategic issues. He has worked with and advised the US government on relations with India for more than two decades. The US-based think tank Carnegie Endowment for International Peace lists Tellis as its Tata Chair for Strategic Affairs and a senior fellow. According to its website, Tellis has bachelor’s and master’s degrees in economics from the University of Mumbai in India, as well as a PhD and master’s degree in political science from the University of Chicago in the US. According to an affidavit filed in the Eastern District Court of Virginia, Tellis is currently working as an unpaid senior adviser for the US Department of State. He is also a contractor at the Office of Net Assessment (ONA) within the Department of Defense (DoD). The ONA is an internal think tank within the Pentagon. Because of his appointment to these roles, Tellis has had the security clearances required to access sensitive government information. He served on the National Security Council of former Republican President George W Bush, who was in office between 2001 and 2009. Previously, Tellis worked as a commissioned officer in the US Foreign Service and was the senior adviser to the US ambassador at the embassy in New Delhi, India, according to the website of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. Tellis played a key role in negotiating a landmark civil nuclear deal between the US and India in 2008. What is Tellis accused of? According to a statement from the US Attorney’s Office for the Eastern District of Virginia, Tellis was arrested over the weekend. Prosecutors claim he has violated 18 US Code § 793, which pertains to gathering, transmitting or losing defence information. The affidavit states that he was observed via a surveillance video camera inside a DoD facility on September 12, using a computer and asking a co-worker to print documents for him. On October 10, he was again seen at the same building, taking some classified documents away with him. Around 3pm (19:00 GMT) on September 25, Tellis entered a US Department of State building in Washington, DC and logged onto the department’s classified intranet system, ClassNet, which he used for around an hour. ClassNet holds unclassified information, classified information up to and including “secret”, and information that has distribution restrictions. The affidavit claims that at 8:11pm (00:11 GMT), Tellis returned to the building and accessed a US Air Force document that was more than 1,000 pages long. He renamed the document and then printed sections of it. He placed sensitive documents in his personal briefcase and took them with him to his residence. On October 11, federal authorities searched Tellis’s house in Vienna, Virginia and his vehicle. Classified government documents were found in his house. Did Tellis meet Chinese officials? The affidavit alleges that Tellis has met with Chinese officials multiple times in recent years. It states that Tellis met Chinese officials for dinner at a restaurant in Fairfax, Virginia in September 2022. He is alleged to have entered the restaurant holding a manila envelope, which he did not seem to have with him when he left two hours later. Tellis is alleged to have again met Chinese officials for dinner at a restaurant in Fairfax in April 2023. He and the officials could be “occasionally overheard talking about Iranian-Chinese relations and emerging technologies, including artificial intelligence”, the affidavit states. Tellis is said to have met Chinese officials again in March 2024, when they were heard talking about US-Pakistan relations. The affidavit adds that Tellis also met Chinese officials for dinner in Fairfax in September this year, when the officials gave him a red gift bag. Could Tellis go to prison? If he is convicted, Tellis could face a maximum of 10 years’ imprisonment and a fine of up to $250,000, according to the statement from the US District Attorney for Eastern Virginia. It added that actual sentences for federal crimes are typically less than the maximum punishment. What has Tellis written about US-India-China relations? Tellis has long been a passionate advocate of strong India-US relations and a champion of India’s potential as a major partner for Washington. However, in his latest publication for the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, published last week, he was more circumspect about India’s capabilities. While the US has long viewed New Delhi as a strategic counterweight to Beijing’s rise, India has, in reality, failed to grow as fast economically as China has. “While India has indeed grown in strength over the last two decades and has partnered with the United States in pushing back on Chinese assertiveness, the larger story is more complex,” Tellis wrote in a paper titled Multipolar Dreams, Bipolar Realities: India’s Great Power Future: “For all of its achievements, India is not growing fast enough to balance China effectively.” Despite these shortcomings, Tellis argued, India has been “obsessed” with preserving its strategic autonomy, hedging its bets in terms of geopolitical friendships instead of firmly committing to the US orbit. This is a mistake on the part of India, Tellis said. Instead, he argued, India – because of its relative weakness compared to China – will need an external partner to help it counter Beijing in the long run. “The most obvious choice is the United States,” he wrote. How are relations between the US and India shifting? Despite a warm personal rapport between US President Donald Trump and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi during Trump’s first term in office, US-India relations have faced challenges since Trump’s inauguration into his second term in January this year. Early in the year, Trump hit India with a 25 percent trade tariff as part of his ongoing trade war with many countries around the world. In August, Trump doubled this to a 50 percent tariff, stating that this was partly in protest at India’s ongoing purchases of oil from Russia, which the US and other countries have sanctioned for its three-and-a-half-year war on neighbouring Ukraine. However, if Trump was trying to coerce India into following US diktats, New Delhi appears to have so far resisted those pressures. India is continuing to buy oil from Russia. Its relations with China – especially frigid between 2020 and 2024 – have thawed. And New Delhi has tightened ties with the Taliban, despite the Afghan group’s pariah status in the eyes of Washington. All of this is a marked change from five years ago. In 2020, India warmly hosted Trump. Later that year, India-China tensions reached a peak when a deadly clash broke out between their soldiers in the Galwan Valley in Ladakh, the first deadly clash in four decades. The two countries share a long, disputed border called the Line of Actual Control (LAC), over which both sides clashed. That year, India banned 200 Chinese apps, including TikTok. In December 2020, India’s foreign minister said that the relationship between India and China had reached its “most difficult phase” in decades. However, since late last year, India and China have tried to reset relations. Modi and Chinese President Xi Jinping met in Kazan, Russia, last year, as their troops pulled back from their eyeball-to-eyeball border standoff. Amid Trump’s tariff wars against both China and India, they have drawn closer this year. Earlier this year, Trump imposed a 145 percent tariff on Chinese imports, prompting China to respond with a 125 percent tariff on US goods. Both countries then agreed to two separate 90-day tariff reductions – in May and again in August – to allow for trade negotiations. But last week, Trump threatened the reimposition of an additional 100 percent tariff for Chinese products. Meanwhile, China’s Foreign Minister, Wang Yi, visited India and met Modi and other Indian officials in August. In a statement after their meeting, Modi hailed a “respect for each other’s interests and sensitiveness” and “steady progress” in bilateral relations. In late August, Modi visited China and held a bilateral meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping. It was Modi’s first visit to China in more than seven years. Last week, amid ongoing border clashes with Pakistan, the Afghan Taliban’s Foreign Minister Amir Khan Muttaqi also visited India – the first such visit by a senior Taliban leader to India since the group took over Afghanistan in 2021. India had long viewed the Taliban as a proxy for Pakistan’s intelligence services, but has in recent years slowly ramped up engagement with the group, culminating in Muttaqi’s visit. The Taliban leader’s visit came soon after the group rejected Trump’s demand for it to hand over the Bagram airbase to the US.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/15/why-has-the-us-arrested-indian-american-analyst-ashley-tellis,World,aljazeera.com,Sarah Shamim,https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/GettyImages-495688274-1760524497.jpg?resize=1920%2C1440,,4cc9c711821355842f25866d3b7ee9dc5b07c85d

Published On 15 Oct 2025 15 Oct 2025 Click here to share on social media share2 Share Syria’s President Ahmed al-Sharaa has told Russia’s President Vladimir Putin that he seeks to “restore and redefine ties” with Moscow, a key ally of ousted longtime Kremlin ally Bashar al-Assad . Al-Sharaa made the statement on Wednesday while meeting with Putin in Moscow during his first state visit to the country that has been hosting al-Assad since his exile from Syria 10 months ago. Recommended Stories list of 3 items end of list “We are trying to restore and redefine in a new way the nature of these relations so there is independence for Syria, sovereign Syria, and also its territorial unity and integrity and its security stability,” al-Sharaa told Putin in the Kremlin. The Syrian leader assured that Damascus would honour all past agreements with Moscow. “There are bilateral relations and shared interests that bind us with Russia, and we respect all agreements made with it,” he said. According to Syrian officials cited by the Reuters and AFP news agencies, al-Sharaa, who once headed the Syrian branch of al-Qaeda under the name Abu Mohammed al-Julani, plans to use today’s meeting with Putin to request Moscow hand over al-Assad . But there was no mention of the sensitive diplomatic matter in al-Sharaa’s brief televised remarks at the beginning of the meeting. Putin praises al-Sharaa’s ‘great success’ Welcoming al-Sharaa, Putin hailed decades of “special relations” between the two countries, in which he claimed Moscow was always guided by Syrian people’s interests, and said his government wanted to expand them. He also praised recent parliamentary elections in Syria – the first since al-Assad’s overthrow – saying the process would strengthen ties between all political forces. “I believe that this is a great success for you, because it leads to the consolidation of society, and despite the fact that Syria is currently going through difficult times, it will nevertheless strengthen ties and cooperation between all political forces in Syria,” said Putin. Despite having been on opposite sides of the battle lines of Syria’s 13-year civil war that Moscow intervened in, the new rulers in Damascus have taken a pragmatic approach to relations with Moscow, as they have with other foreign powers . For Damascus, maintaining ties with Russia is important for rebuilding the war-shattered country and shoring up international legitimacy for the government. In a recent interview with US network CBS, al-Sharaa said, “Russia has close and longstanding relations with Syria, which relate to the basic structure of the state and to energy and food, for which Syria depends partly on Russian supplies, as well as some old strategic interests”. Russia, for its part, has retained a presence at its air and naval bases on the Syrian coast, and the Kremlin has voiced hope for negotiating a deal to keep the outposts. Moscow has also reportedly sent oil shipments to Syria.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/15/syria-seeks-to-redefine-russia-ties-al-sharaa-tells-putin-in-moscow,World,aljazeera.com,Stephen Quillen,https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2025-10-15T120534Z_2054977000_RC2CCHAYYK1B_RTRMADP_3_SYRIA-SECURITY-RUSSIA-1760533258.jpg?resize=1920%2C1440,,2dc64bee75c45a17d07a81431dc23a3d14aa6430

The number of confirmed teams has now risen to 28 following the latest round of qualifiers, with another 20 still to be filled by various confederational playoffs, intercontinental playoffs, and – in Europe’s case – the main qualifying stage, which still needs to be completed. Recommended Stories list of 4 items end of list England , South Africa and Qatar were among the headline names to book their place at the tournament on Tuesday. Al Jazeera Sport takes a look at the tournament that the nations around the world are all vying to reach. When and where is the FIFA World Cup 2026? The tournament is being staged across the United States, Canada and Mexico. The first match will be played in Mexico City on June 11, while the final will be staged in New Jersey, US, on July 19. Due to the expansion of the tournament – from 32 teams to 48 – the 39-day event is the longest in its history. When will we know all the teams for the FIFA World Cup 2026? FIFA’s intercontinental playoffs will be the last chance saloon for teams around the world to reach next summer’s event. The finale of that route will be on March 31, 2026, less than three months before the World Cup kicks off. The European qualification process runs until March, but most of the remaining confederations will have finished their continental qualification processes long before then. What are the FIFA intercontinental playoffs? Once the respective confederations finish their qualification process, FIFA offers two final spots to be contested by the best-placed team from each of the six continental routes that have not already qualified. When is the draw for the FIFA World Cup 2026? Although we will not know the full list of teams for the event until the end of March 2026, the draw will take place on December 5, 2025. Where will the draw be held for the FIFA World Cup 2026? The draw will take place in the Kennedy Center in Washington, DC. US President Donald Trump confirmed the location while speaking in the Oval Office at the White House, flanked by Vice President JD Vance and FIFA boss Gianni Infantino. He did not rule out overseeing the draw itself. What will the format be for the FIFA World Cup 2026? With the expansion to 48 teams, the World Cup will now feature 12 four-team groups. That in turn will lead to a round of 32, an extra knockout round to previous editions. Indeed, the tournament has doubled in size since it was staged in the US in 1994, when only 24 teams competed. Can Trump move games at the FIFA World Cup 2026? Trump has been quite clear and consistent on the staging of games within the US, saying he will move the games from any cities that he deems to be unsafe. On September 26, when Trump was asked about games being moved, he warned: “Well, that’s an interesting question … but we’re going to make sure they’re safe. [Seattle and San Francisco are] run by radical left lunatics who don’t know what they’re doing.” How will the FIFA World Cup 2026 game staging be split between the hosts? The US will stage games in 11 cities: Atlanta, Boston, Dallas, Houston, Kansas City, Los Angeles, Miami, New Jersey/New York (joint host region), Philadelphia, San Francisco Bay Area and Seattle. Canada will host 13 games in total, split between Toronto and Vancouver. Mexico will also get 13 games, which will be played in Mexico City, Guadalajara and Monterrey. Where will the FIFA World Cup 2026 final be staged? The US will stage the final, which will be played at MetLife Stadium in New Jersey . Who are the defending FIFA World Cup champions? Argentina won the last edition of the FIFA World Cup, beating France in the final of Qatar 2022. With the game level at 3-3 after extra time, Argentina won the penalty shootout 4-2. Will the weather affect games at the FIFA World Cup 2026? The 2025 FIFA Club World Cup was staged in the US, and the heat and resulting thunderstorms proved to be a huge problem for the tournament. Three stadiums – in Arlington, Atlanta and Houston – have retractable roofs that are expected to be closed due to the summer heat, while Inglewood and Vancouver have fixed roofs. Which teams have already qualified for the FIFA World Cup 2026? After the latest round of qualifying matches, here is a breakdown of the confirmed contenders from each of the six regions: Hosts: Canada, Mexico, USA Asia: Australia, Iran, Japan, Jordan, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, South Korea, Uzbekistan Africa: Algeria, Cape Verde, Egypt, Ghana, Ivory Coast, Morocco, Senegal, South Africa, Tunisia Europe: England Oceania: New Zealand South America: Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, Paraguay, Uruguay Which teams can still qualify for the FIFA World Cup 2026?

24eb07b7336f,Is your beef linked to Amazon deforestation? A report highlights loopholes,"news, climate, climate crisis, environment, brazil, latin america","The world’s largest meat company, JBS, has allegedly fuelled illegal deforestation, land grabs and human rights abuses in the Brazilian Amazon by sourcing cattle from ranches operating inside protected areas, according to a new Human Rights Watch investigation. On Wednesday, the nonprofit issued an 86-page report focusing on the state of Pará, where the United Nations will hold its annual climate change summit, COP30, next month. Recommended Stories list of 3 items end of list The report highlights a gap in JBS’s supply chain: Human Rights Watch claims the meat company does not track its indirect cattle suppliers. Investigators found that cattle raised on illegally deforested land were moved through a “laundering” system that concealed their origins before they reached JBS. That, in turn, means JBS cannot guarantee that its beef or leather products are not contributing to deforestation and related abuses. Without a better system for tracing livestock, JBS will continue to be “unable to root out illegal cattle ranches”, according to Luciana Téllez, a senior environment researcher at Human Rights Watch. And what JBS does not know could make it responsible for bankrolling illegal ranches that clear-cut the Amazon, she explained. “We cannot say with 100-percent certainty that the cattle that JBS purchased from its direct suppliers are the same ones that are coming from illegal cattle ranches, but neither can JBS,” Téllez told Al Jazeera. “That’s a problem, because they are responsible for what they are procuring.” Cattle walk through an illegally burned forest in the northern Brazilian state of Para on September 15, 2009 [Andre Penner/AP Photo] A deforestation hotspot Wednesday’s report is part of an ever-growing body of literature delving into the impact agriculture has had on the Amazon rainforest. The construction of ranches and farmland is considered the single biggest direct cause of deforestation in the world’s tropical regions. The Amazon rainforest is no exception. In recent years, cattle ranching has emerged as a primary culprit in the levelling of its tangled, biodiverse jungles. The northern state of Pará is key to the fight against further loss. It has consistently recorded the highest levels of deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon since 2016. In 2024 alone, 17,195 square kilometres (6,639 sq miles) of forest in the state were degraded, a 421-percent increase over the previous year, according to Human Rights Watch. The state also reports the second-largest number of land conflicts in Brazil, with illegal ranchers, farmers and criminal groups seeking to invade protected land. For Indigenous and traditional communities that consider the Amazon home, these invasions have been devastating. Residents have seen their crops destroyed, the forest burned, and their lives displaced. In some cases, community members have even been threatened, attacked or killed after denouncing the land grabs. Though federal law prohibits such activity, some land-grabbers have succeeded in fraudulently registering protected rainforest as private properties. Wednesday’s report documented encroachments in two protected areas: the Cachoeira Seca Indigenous territory and the Terra Nossa sustainable development area. “The level of violence and intimidation by land grabbers in Terra Nossa is truly frightening, and the absolute impunity they’ve enjoyed for years is astonishing,” Tellez told Al Jazeera. Human Rights Watch said that Pará’s state animal health agency, Adepará, had registered ranches in both tracts of land. It also authorised the transportation of cattle in and out of the two areas. According to the report, Adepará claimed that it has not historically been tasked with observing environmental criteria when authorising livestock movements. But with the state agency’s approval, Human Rights Watch said cattle were raised illegally inside the protected rainforest zones and then transferred out to other ranches. From there, they could reach major slaughterhouses, including JBS facilities. Each transfer helped obscure the cattle’s illegal origin, effectively laundering the animals into the meat trade.

Brazil does not keep full histories of individual animals. Instead, their movements are documented with “animal transit permits”, known as Guias de Trânsito Animal or GTAs. Those permits collect information about overall shipments of animals: the number of cattle involved, plus data about the sex and the age of those in the group. But without an individual record for every cow, calf and bull, it is difficult, if not impossible, to trace their origins. In an April filing to the United States Securities and Exchange Commission, JBS acknowledged the loopholes in how the GTA system traces cattle. “As a result, there can be no assurance that available monitoring procedures can ensure that the origin of any head of cattle was in full compliance with applicable laws,” JBS wrote. The company has promised to require its suppliers to declare their suppliers by 2026. Yet, Human Rights Watch says it remains unclear how such information would be verified or enforced. “The best solution is for the federal government itself to institute a traceability mechanism for cattle across Brazil,” Tellez said. “The Brazilian government is moving towards that, but it’s moving extremely slowly.” JBS also made a similar commitment more than a decade and a half ago. In 2009, the company signed the G4 Cattle Agreement with environmental group Greenpeace, pledging to identify all its indirect suppliers by 2011. It failed to meet that deadline. “It’s unacceptable that companies such as JBS have not fulfilled the promises that they made in the past,” Cristiane Mazzetti, a forest campaign coordinator at Greenpeace Brazil, told Al Jazeera. “It’s something that now governments need to reflect upon and regulate in a more stringent way, because only believing in voluntary corporate commitments is not going to deliver.” JBS did not respond to Al Jazeera’s request for comment by publication.

In 2023, Pará’s governor introduced a decree requiring all animal movements in the state to be fully traceable by the end of 2026. At the federal level, the Ministry of Agriculture announced a similar plan in December 2024, mandating that all states implement tracking systems by 2032. However, Human Rights Watch warns that this timeline is too slow and could allow illegal ranching to persist for years. Experts and advocacy groups say that Brazil should take immediate steps, including by making GTA data publicly accessible. Such measures would help law enforcement agencies identify fraudulent movements and trace cattle back to illegal ranches. “Companies struggle with traceability, firstly because they have minimal access to public data on the production chain,” said Lisandro Inakake, an agronomist with the Brazilian environmental nonprofit Imaflora. He added that the struggle is compounded “because there are no universal market requirements covering all of the companies’ operations”. While Human Rights Watch has called on JBS to voluntarily start tracing the lifespan of its cattle, Mazzetti, the Greenpeace campaigner, believes more decisive action is necessary if deforestation is to be stopped. “It’s not time for new promises,” she said. “It’s time to be held accountable for all the impacts that their supply chain generated in the Amazon, in other ecosystems, and also on the climate.”",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/15/is-your-beef-linked-to-amazon-deforestation-a-report-highlights-loopholes,World,aljazeera.com,Inigo Alexander,https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/AP25148675569192-1760492660.jpg?resize=1920%2C1440,,a6107915820d7ea55aff4ac821499fd6b8635de5

The port fees from both sides went into force on Tuesday and have caused fear among analysts, who say maritime trade has become a key battlefront between the two nations. Recommended Stories list of 4 items end of list The new trade tensions erupted despite a pause in the tariff war, and come as Trump is expected to meet his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit in South Korea at the end of this month. China has accused the US of “double standards” after it threatened to impose a 100 percent tariff on Chinese goods following last week’s rare earth curbs by Beijing. Here’s what to know about the new port tariffs as the two countries are engaged in ongoing trade negotiations: FILE- In this May 21, 2018, file photo, container ships are unloaded at the Port of Oakland in Oakland, California [Ben Margot/AFP] What are the port fees imposed by the two sides? A White House executive order named “Restoring America’s Maritime Dominance” directed the US Trade Representative (USTR) to impose charges on owners and operators of Chinese-built, owned, or operated vessels entering the US by October 14  as follows: Vessel operators must pay $50 per net ton for Chinese-owned or operated vessels arriving at a US port, to be increased to $140 by April 2028 Vessel operators of Chinese-built vessels arriving at a US port must pay $18 per net ton or $120 per container, which will be increased to $33 and $250, respectively, by 2028 Fees are to be charged for a maximum of five times per year for individual vessels Long-term users of China-operated vessels carrying US ethane and liquified petroleum gas (LPG) are exempt till December 10 China, on October 10, retaliated and said it would also charge US-owned, operated, built, or flagged vessels additional levies starting from October 14 as follows: Vessels owned or operated by American companies or individuals will pay a 400 yuan ($56) per net ton fee for every voyage Ships or vessels built in the US or flying an American flag will pay the same amount The fees will be charged for a maximum of five trips per year, and will rise to reach 1,120 yuan ($157) per net ton Empty vessels entering Chinese shipyards for repair are exempt. Chinese-built ships are also exempt. China’s Ministry of Transport said in a statement on October 10 that the tariffs were “countermeasures” meant to respond to the US’s “wrongful and discriminatory” practices. In a separate but related move, China on Tuesday imposed sanctions on five subsidiaries of South Korean shipbuilder Hanwha Ocean, which it said “assisted and supported” US investigations into Chinese trade. The US was the first to levy additional fees on Chinese-owned ships back in April in a bid to loosen Beijing’s hold on the global maritime industry and bolster US ship manufacturers. That decision followed an investigation under the Joe Biden administration that revealed China dominates global maritime, logistics, and shipbuilding using “unfair policies and practices” such as funnelling state funds into shipbuilding. China hit back at the US and said it would also charge similar fees on the same day US tariffs were set to go into effect. In a statement on Tuesday, China’s Ministry of Commerce said: “If the US chooses confrontation, China will see it through to the end; if it chooses dialogue, China’s door remains open.” (Al Jazeera) Who are the main players in the global maritime trade? China dominates the global commercial shipbuilding industry, followed by South Korea and Japan, according to data from the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS). Beijing built 53 percent of commercial ships in 2024, while the US produced only 0.1 percent of such vessels. Chinese state-owned China State Shipbuilding Corporation (CSSC) is the most significant player in the industry, and built more commercial vessels by tonnage in 2024 than all of the US shipbuilders have done since 1945, according to CSIS. The state-owned CSSC also notably manufactures naval warships, and contributes to China’s status as having the largest naval fleet by ship numbers -at 355 vessels by 2020, according to a US Department of Defense report, compared with the US’s 293 naval vessels at the time. While analysts point out that the US maintains the strongest navy based on firepower, China’s shipbuilding dominance has raised security concerns in Washington for several years. Why did the US impose curbs on Chinese-built ships? The US is attempting to loosen China’s grip on maritime dominance. Washington first began mulling taking action against China’s shipbuilding capabilities in May 2024, after five US trade unions petitioned the USTR for “relief” against what they called China’s “unreasonable” practices in the maritime and shipbuilding sector, citing extensive state-led support for the Chinese shipbuilding and maritime sectors, which the US argues gives Beijing an unfair edge over competitors. The USTR thereafter launched investigations into Chinese shipping trade practices. In January 2025, after President Trump was sworn into office, the department determined that Chinese actions “burdened and restricted” US commerce, and that action would be taken. Over several weeks, US trade unions and lobbyists testified at public hearings regarding the action to be taken, before Trump’s Executive Order “14269 – Restoring America’s Maritime Dominance” was published in April. In March, President Trump, in an address to Congress, promised that his administration would “resurrect” the US shipping industry and added that he would create an “office of shipbuilding”. “We are also going to resurrect the American shipbuilding industry, including commercial shipbuilding and military shipbuilding,” Trump told lawmakers, prompting applause from House Republicans. “We used to make so many ships. We don’t make them any more very much, but we’re going to make them very fast, very soon. It will have a huge impact to further enhance our national security.” In a statement following Trump’s speech, Matthew Paxton, president of the Shipbuilders Council of America, praised the president’s move. “By fully utilising the existing domestic shipyard capacity, the shipyard industrial base can meet the growing demands of national defence, restore American competitiveness, and create thousands of skilled jobs in communities across the nation,” he said. How will the tariffs affect global trade? Analysts say the move on both sides is disrupting global trade operations already. Chinese container carrier COSCO could bear the most burden from the US fees, expected to cost the industry $3.2bn, while shipping intelligence firm Clarksons Research said in a report that China’s new port fees could significantly affect oil tankers, which account for 15 percent of global capacity, the Reuters news agency reported. Major shipping links, including Danish-owned Maersk, German Hapag-Lloyd, and French CMA CGM, have reportedly swapped China-linked ships from their US shipping lanes, according to Reuters. “We are in the hectic stage of the disruption where everyone is quietly trying to improvise workarounds, with varying degrees of success,” Ed Finley-Richardson, an independent dry bulk shipping analyst, told Reuters. The analyst added that there are reports of US ship owners operating non-Chinese vessels trying to sell their cargoes to other countries while en route to China, so the vessels can divert. Reuters reported that it was not immediately able to confirm the claim. Meanwhile, South Korean shipbuilder Hanwha Ocean is already facing Chinese sanctions on five of its US-linked subsidiaries. Hanwha is one of the world’s largest ship manufacturers, and owns the commercial Philly Shipyard in the US state of Philadelphia. Hanwha Ocean’s shares dropped nearly 6 percent following the announcement, Reuters noted. What are the other trade curbs announced, and will this lead to an all-out trade war? China, which has a monopoly on critical rare-earth metals used to manufacture electronics, tightened export controls on five of them on October 9 under its “announcement number 61 of 2025”, including holmium, erbium, thulium, europium, and ytterbium. That’s in addition to curbs on seven metals announced earlier in April. President Trump, in retaliation, has threatened to raise tariffs on Chinese goods to 100 percent from November 1. The US imposed heavy tariffs on Chinese goods earlier in Trump’s presidency, in an attempt to address what Washington views as imbalanced trade relations. Those tariffs were eventually eased after the two countries came to an agreement in September for a 90-day pause that is set to expire on about November 9. However, tensions are again high following the new rare earth tariffs by China, and the port levies announced by both countries. Analysts have previously warned that a full-scale trade war between the US and China could hit global markets badly and prompt a recession.",https://www.aljazeera.com/economy/2025/10/15/us-china-impose-port-fees-is-a-return-to-all-out-trade-war-imminent,World,aljazeera.com,,https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2025-05-12T163923Z_241304327_RC2FGEAHM0QA_RTRMADP_3_USA-TRUMP-TARIFFS-1760366950.jpg?resize=1920%2C1440,,4095901a6276f61b58ecd07342676abd259a5f67

5c62bebe0111,"What is nihilistic violent extremism, blamed for most mass shootings in US?","news, crime, explainer, united states, us & canada","The killing of far-right influencer Charlie Kirk last month by a 22-year-old suspect has brought into focus the epidemic of gun violence in the United States. While Kirk was a victim of political violence, investigators are now pointing to a growing trend where shooters are not necessarily inspired by a clear-cut political ideology. Federal law enforcement officials have started using “nihilistic violent extremists” to describe perpetrators who do not easily subscribe to one ideology but appear to be motivated by a desire to, as one expert put it, “gamify” real-life violence. Recommended Stories list of 4 items end of list The description appeared in a March search warrant application involving a Wisconsin teenager who was active on a Telegram network dubbed Terrorgram. Nikita Casap, now 18, is accused of killing his mother and stepfather in part of a larger plot to assassinate President Donald Trump, foment a political revolution and “save the white race” from “Jewish-controlled” politicians, investigators said, quoting from a document on Casap’s phone. This “extremism” is not new, but the label seems to be. “Nihilistic violent extremists”, a federal law enforcement officer wrote in the court filing, act “primarily from a hatred of society at large and a desire to bring about its collapse by sowing indiscriminate chaos, destruction, and social instability”. In such instances, perpetrators often take what they learn in online communities as fuel for real-world horror. They may not singularly ascribe to the political left or right, to white supremacist thought or antigovernment “extremism”, as they glorify violence or seek destruction. The National Counterterrorism Innovation, Technology, and Education Center (NCITE) at the University of Nebraska preliminarily identified more than two dozen federal cases in which suspects fit this emerging “nihilistic violent extremism” classification, including the mass shooter at the Annunciation Catholic Church in Minneapolis. What are these cases, and how might they shape future domestic “terrorism” investigations? How ‘nihilism’ fits with domestic violence and ‘terrorism’ “Nihilism” is a philosophical term associated with German philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche. It is the belief that all values are baseless. “Violent extremists” are often trying to change specific government policy, University of South Florida associate professor Zacharias Pieri said. “Nihilistic extremists”, by contrast, don’t necessarily have any clear, stated objective, he said; they are “gamifying violence in real life”. Independent journalist Ken Klippenstein and extremism researcher Jacob Ware began covering the term’s emergence in federal cases in April and May. In September, FBI Director Kash Patel told a US Senate committee that “nihilistic violent extremism” plays a significant role in domestic “terror” investigations. “We have in this country 1,700 domestic terrorism investigations, a large chunk of which are nihilistic violent extremism, NVE — those who engage in violent acts motivated by a deep hatred of society, whatever that justification they see it is,” Patel said. Besides the Casap case, federal prosecutors have cited the “nihilistic violent extremism” label in a handful of news releases since March. The Department of Justice in April called the online pornography network 764 “a nihilistic violent extremist (NVE) network” when it announced the arrests of two people it said were involved in targeting children for sexual exploitation online. “The 764 network’s accelerationist goals include social unrest and the downfall of the current world order, including the US Government,” the department said. Several weeks later, the FBI used the term about an Oregon 14-year-old who the agency said planned a May explosives attack and mass shooting at a mall in Kelso in Washington state. The FBI said the teenager “shared nihilistic violent extremist ideology and the plans in online chats”. KPTV in Oregon reported that police said the teenager posted the plans in an online chat. The teenager’s defence lawyer said the online chat was connected to 764, which the teen joined after being bullied at school. For years, experts have said some ‘extremists’ defy a single label In 2020, then-FBI Director Christopher Wray said some “violent extremists” hold a “salad bar of ideologies” containing “a little bit of this, a little bit of that, and what they are really about is the violence”. “We’re having more and more challenges trying to unpack what are often sort of incoherent belief systems, combined with kind of personal grievances,” Wray told senators in 2022. He referred to a Minneapolis case in which two men aligned with the far-right, antigovernment Boogaloo Bois movement were charged with providing material support to the Palestinian group Hamas. Other terms have also been used to describe these less absolute ideologies associated with violence. In the United Kingdom, law enforcement uses the term “composite violent extremism” to refer to “extremists” who hold “multiple distinct ideologies, sentiments, grievances, and fixations” and “mixed, unclear, or unstable ideologies”. Experts said the NVE term is valid, but offered some cautions Experts on “extremism” said they see value in using the term “nihilistic violent extremism” to acknowledge the evolving nature of threats. Oren Segal, an Anti-Defamation League (ADL) extremism expert, said incidents in recent years involved suspects who appeared motivated to sow chaos. “Those are fairly described as nihilistic,” Segal said. The ADL said that school shooters in Evergreen, Colorado, Antioch, Tennessee, and Madison, Wisconsin, were active in online spaces that glorify violence and mass killings. Marc-Andre Argentino, an independent researcher and expert on violent extremism, wrote in April that NVE “represents a convergence threat – part sadistic subculture, part extremist accelerationism, part organised cyber‑harassment – whose potency lies in its agility and absence of limiting ideology”. Unlike a right-wing group that may study doctrine for months, “nihilistic violent extremists” share “bite-sized” information about how to carry out attacks such as knife attacks, vehicle ramming, or online crimes. “The guiding principle is to flood the system with low‑cost, high‑chaos events – school shootings, animal‑cruelty viral clips, swatting campaigns – so that authorities expend resources faster than radicals expend effort,” Argentino wrote. “Tactically, NVEs seek maximum systemic shock with minimal organisational footprint.” Experts cautioned against the term’s overuse. “If everything is going to be lumped together as nihilist violent extremism, it does [a] disservice to those who try to understand where threats are emanating from,” Segal said. Ware, a research fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, told PolitiFact that the label risks being used by prosecutors or a politicised FBI as “a blanket term that obscures or even excuses other ideological influences, especially white supremacy”. One case with unclear motives was the July 4, 2022 mass shooting that killed seven and injured dozens in Highland Park, Illinois. FBI affidavits said the shooter told them he wanted to “wake people up”. His online activity showed he had a fascination with violence. “This country is facing a growing threat of heavily armed young men who use too-easily acquirable weapons to commit unspeakable acts of violence,” Segal wrote after the attack. “Some of them are extremists; most of them are not. Whatever their motivation, they need to be stopped. For now, that may be the only analysis we can all agree on.” *Researcher Caryn Baird contributed to this article*",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/15/what-is-nihilistic-violent-extremism-blamed-for-most-mass-shootings-in-us,World,aljazeera.com,,https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/afp_68af361f8df3-1756313119.jpg?resize=1920%2C1365,,3a440289abc73077b26326b0e19a6d7d55f8489d

3690dead417f,How Israel plans to continue the war without its army,"opinions, gaza, israel-palestine conflict, middle east, palestine","Published On 15 Oct 2025 15 Oct 2025 Click here to share on social media share2 Share Israel’s war on Gaza has not ended with the pullback of its tanks or the falling silent of its warplanes. Tens of thousands have been killed, hundreds of thousands of homes reduced to rubble, and some two million people driven from their homes. Yet the greatest danger may still lie ahead, for Israel intends to continue the war in another form, one that no longer requires its army. In the vacuum left by Israel’s destruction, a grim new reality is unfolding. Armed militias are emerging, exploiting the collapse of social order and the deepening suffering of the people. These groups, which once claimed the mantle of “resistance” to the occupier, are increasingly turning their weapons inward. Rather than working to aid the defence of the homeland, they are seeking to impose control through violence, turning Palestinian pain into a currency for factional and political gain. Gaza, long under siege, once lived in suffocating isolation yet remained largely safe within its own walls. People feared Israeli air attacks, not criminal gangs or the gun of a neighbour. Today, fear has multiplied, from the occupation and from within. The killing of journalist Saleh Aljafarawi in Gaza City’s Sabra neighbourhood stands as one of the most ominous signs of this new phase. The 28-year-old reporter, who had long documented Israel’s atrocities in Gaza and faced repeated death threats for his work, was shot dead days after the ceasefire, not by Israeli soldiers or drones but by Palestinian gunmen. His murder exposed the war’s continuation by other means: Israel has turned Palestinians against each other, spurring a cycle of fear and bloodshed that serves its occupation even in the absence of its soldiers. Israel’s logic here is clear. It has long relied on an old colonial strategy: Divide and rule. A society consumed by internal violence cannot stand united against its occupier. By cynically fostering the rise of militias , Israel achieves two aims: Weakening Palestinian unity and reducing the burden on its own army. It avoids direct costs and international scrutiny, while Gaza continues to bleed from within. The armed gangs now spreading fear in Gaza are not defenders of the homeland but Israel’s collaborators, serving its occupation under a different name. They were empowered during the war to act where Israel could not always act openly. Yet Israel’s history with Palestinians who serve its interests is clear: It uses them, then discards them. Once their purpose is fulfilled, collaborators are cast aside, disarmed or destroyed, left with neither honour nor protection. He who turns his gun on his own people may think himself powerful, but his fate is always the same: Rejection by his people, by history and even by the occupier who once used him. For Palestinians, the consequences are nothing short of catastrophic. Liberation cannot be built on fear. When resistance loses its moral clarity, when it becomes indistinguishable from oppression, it collapses in legitimacy. The Palestinian cause has never been only about survival; it has always been about dignity, justice and freedom. These values cannot endure in a society where citizens fear not only Israeli aircraft but also armed locals who now terrorise their streets, serving both their own interests and the occupier’s. The region’s history bears witness: From Lebanon to Iraq, external powers have repeatedly exploited militias to fragment societies. Once unleashed, these forces rarely serve their people; their loyalties drift instead towards factional power, personal gain or foreign patrons. The task before Palestinians is both urgent and existential: To prevent Gaza from sliding into a land ruled by militias rather than united under the banner of liberation. This requires a strong civilian will that refuses to legitimise such groups, political leadership that places national unity above factional interest, and international awareness that occupation destroys not only through bombs and siege, but also by tearing apart the social fabric and turning society into a battlefield of internal conflict. The people of Gaza have already shown extraordinary courage and resilience. They have endured siege, relentless bombardment and mass displacement. They should not now be asked to endure the humiliation of being ruled by armed gangs who serve their own interests while claiming to act for their people. The strength of the Palestinian struggle has always rested on its moral clarity, a people demanding freedom against all odds. That clarity must not be surrendered to those who replace solidarity with fear and justice with domination. Israel may hope to wage its war by proxy, imagining a Gaza where its people fight each other instead of resisting occupation. Yet Palestinians still have a choice. They can reject the path of militias and affirm that their cause is greater than any faction and stronger than those who place power above principle. The true danger today is not only Israeli air attacks but the erosion of the very essence of Palestinian nationalism: The conviction that liberation must belong to everyone and must never come at the cost of freedom or human dignity.

Abandoned cars are strewn amid rubble where homes once stood. Shops are silent, streaked black where flames licked against the windows. Amid escalating violence by settlers from illegal Israeli settlements across the occupied West Bank, the Israeli military has intensified its efforts to forcibly displace the tens of thousands of Palestinians who live in the Nur Shams and Tulkarem refugee camps. An unprecedented ground assault, replete with bulldozers, arson, and sniper fire, has made life impossible for the people there, most of whom have been pushed out to shelters or other villages. In the nearly empty Nur Shams camp, Israeli soldiers stand on rooftops, aim their sniper rifles from windows, and patrol empty streets with searchlights. Sometimes, the green dot from a weapon’s laser sight dances across the bodies of the few remaining, unarmed residents as they walk by. Since January, the Israeli military’s violent “Operation Iron Wall” has displaced some 32,000 residents of the Tulkarem, Nur Shams and Jenin refugee camps, according to the United Nations agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA). The Israeli army, which has designated both camps as closed military areas, is likely to stay there for months and fire on anyone who enters. Palestinian families have submitted more than 400 requests to Israel to retrieve their belongings from their homes, but none have been approved, according to the UN. ‘I am your lord, you are here to serve me’ Abdel’s* family is one of the few that Israeli soldiers have allowed to remain. He, his wife, and his mother sit tensely in their front room; his three daughters are at school. They are permanently on edge because the soldiers have established a temporary barracks next to their home. Since early February, the soldiers have forced him to work for them without pay, fixing their electricity, internet or air conditioning, and bringing them food, any time of day or night, usually at his own expense. He is constantly afraid that the soldiers will burst into their home at any moment. “We don’t want anything. Just a safe life,” he tells Al Jazeera. “I can’t go out with my children,” says Abdel. “I can’t even go out with my wife. We’re deprived of … even the simplest necessities of life.” In late January, soldiers raided Abdel’s house, destroying furniture and possessions and forcing the family out of their home, which is just outside the Tulkarem refugee camp, for 10 days. Scorch marks on a building burned by Israeli forces on the outskirts of Tulkarem refugee camp [Delaney Nolan/Al Jazeera] When they returned, Abdel says he was told: “We won’t throw you out of the house as long as you help us.” “One of them even said, ‘I am your lord, you are here to serve me.’” Since then, Abdel has obeyed their orders to keep his family safe. He estimates he is forced to spend 1,500 shekels ($440) a month on the soldiers. “If I don’t do what they tell me, they will destroy the house,” he frets. He says he knows the soldiers’ threats are real because, as he speaks, a house in the camp just 500 metres (about 550 yards) away is burning, sending up clouds of smoke. All his neighbours have been displaced, and some of their homes have been burned or trashed to the point of being uninhabitable. Abdel walks around the corner to his neighbour Nihad’s home, which was also taken over by soldiers for a while but sits empty now, surrounded by half-burned possessions, including personal documents, set alight by Israeli soldiers. In April, Israeli soldiers stormed into Nihad’s home at 3am, and ordered him, his wife, and three children at gunpoint to leave within five minutes. The soldiers moved in for the following 75 days, using it as a barracks. Nihad, who refused to give his family name for fear of reprisals from Israel, says he was ordered to stay away but came back anyway to survey the damage. Together, the two men pick through the wreckage. Nihad tells Abdel the home he loves is unrecognisable, that he and his family have lost everything. Soldiers smashed everything they could find, even the washing machine’s circuits, tore up electrical boxes, broke toilets and knocked down doors. The soldiers slept in his children’s beds and scattered infants’ clothing across the floor. Rubbish and debris are strewn through every room; a bird has nested in the shower. The soldiers set up a sniper outpost in the stairwell ringed with sandbags, and left the walls daubed with the names of Israeli soldiers and their patrol schedules in Hebrew. The words “F*** Hamas” in English are scrawled in lipstick across a dresser mirror. This kind of damage, Abdel says, shows the consequences of defying the soldiers’ demands. An atmosphere of terror Nihad is far from the only victim. The Israeli military has destroyed hundreds of homes in the camps and adjoining neighbourhoods during its raids. It also damaged critical infrastructure, including water and electricity networks. The Israeli army carved ‘roads’ through Tulkarem camp by demolishing homes. Forcibly displaced residents who re-enter the camp risk being shot [Delaney Nolan/Al Jazeera] In July, Israel’s High Court froze a military order for the demolition of 104 residential buildings, comprising some 400 homes, in Tulkarem. But the next day, it amended its ruling to permit the army to demolish for “overriding security considerations” – effectively giving it broad discretion to continue. Adalah, an Israel-based legal centre for Arab minority rights, has been petitioning against the demolitions. In July, the centre submitted an expert opinion from the Israeli human rights organisation Bimkom – Planners for Planning Rights to the Supreme Court, showing that 162 buildings had been demolished – far more than the number in the order. Adalah’s investigation found that the demolitions had so far “erased” about one-third of the built-up area in the northern sector of Tulkarem, and made other areas unlivable, according to Miriam Azem, Adalah’s international advocacy coordinator. The court rejected Adalah’s petition on July 25, asserting that “the demolition order was lawful and necessary, upholding the military commander’s broad discretion and limited judicial review”, Azem tells Al Jazeera. Abdel has no means to object – angering the soldiers would mean putting himself at the mercy of a military force with a long history of demolishing, detaining and killing. Accelerating demolitions, adding arson to the destruction Israel is now demolishing homes in the West Bank at the fastest rate since the 1967 War, partly thanks to equipment from the United States. At the beginning of the year, the Israeli army had just two or three Caterpillar bulldozers, which are produced in Texas. Now they have 10, according to Suleiman Suhairi, a member of Tulkarem’s Popular Committee, which acts as a liaison between the refugee camp and external bodies, such as the UN. Residents say the Israeli army is also increasingly committing arson, burning residential homes rather than bulldozing them. “Every day, they burn two or three houses,” Suhairi said, speaking in early July. The burnings increased in June, but the soldiers claim they have nothing to do with it, Suhairi says. To prevent arson, residents now try to remove or cut off their cookers, which are often used to start fires, says Suhairi, explaining that firefighters and homeowners say soldiers light all the burners and throw a blanket on them to start the blaze. “The patterns of exploitation Palestinians face today in the West Bank represent an intensification of an ongoing strategy designed to make life unbearable,” says Ihab Maharmeh, a researcher at the Arab Center for Research and Policy Studies, which focuses on Palestinian workers and displacement. A former Palestinian Authority-run school is now a shelter for 17 families displaced from Nur Shams camp [Delaney Nolan/Al Jazeera] “Israeli authorities are effectively transforming everyday life and livelihoods in the West Bank into a form of warfare.” Nur Arafeh, a fellow with the Malcolm H Kerr Carnegie Middle East Center, says Abdel’s story “exemplifies the colonial mentality that underpins Israel’s occupation – one rooted in supremacy, domination, oppression and the systematic dehumanisation of Palestinians”. “The soldier’s language”, referring to himself as Abdel’s “lord”, “reveals the profound power asymmetries at play, whereby the threat of expulsion is used as a coercive and exploitative tool to force compliance and free labour”, Arafeh says. Al Jazeera contacted the Israeli army and the Government Press Office for comment on the allegations of arson and coerced labour, but received no response. ‘Israel doesn’t respect international law’ On a hill above Nur Shams, more than 130 members of 17 families have taken shelter in a government-run school-turned refugee camp. Each family occupies one room, and all share one toilet. The shelter is privately funded, which helps fill the gaps left as local humanitarian agencies struggle to meet needs with limited funding. In the shelter, life continues: families hang laundry on lines; they grow chilli peppers and herbs in pots. Those who have fled there are just a short walk from their old homes, but a world away from their former lives. Standing on the third-floor balcony, a man draped in a keffiyeh looks at his former home, just visible between two apartment buildings but unreachable now, empty. Those who try to go back to their homes in the camp risk being shot at and possibly killed. Most families displaced from the camps end up renting temporary accommodation in the area – Mohamed Kamel, his wife, and their four children are now living in a rented home. Israeli soldiers forced Kamel and his family out of their home at gunpoint five months and two days before he spoke to Al Jazeera in July. He knows because he counts the days. The day they left, it was pouring with rain, and they were given just two minutes to leave. They lost everything: every piece of clothing, every toy, even their young daughter’s teddy bear. They walked for hours to a neighbouring village, carrying Kamel’s injured mother on a stretcher as she had recently broken her leg in a fall. Kamel had lived all 40 years of his life in the family home. Now, the family is renting an apartment in the neighbouring village. The bicycle of Saddam Rajab, a 10-year-old who was killed by an Israeli soldier, sits outside his mother’s house in Tulkarem city, March 17, 2025 [Leo Correa/AP Photo] When Kamel tried to return to fetch his car, which he needed for work, he was shot at by soldiers and barely escaped with his life. Many people here have lost loved ones. Of the 198 Palestinians who were killed by Israeli forces in the West Bank since the start of the year, 78 are from Jenin and Tulkarem. Even Abdel is not safe. The fires largely stopped by early August, and in mid-August, the soldiers near his home moved to a different barracks, and he briefly found relief from their demands and harassment. But 10 days later, Abdel was arrested and detained for a month. While he was being held, his wife, kids and mother were expelled from their home. About a week after that, Israel rounded up about 1,500 residents of Tulkarem, including children. Abdel was released days later. “They were difficult days, as I was brutally beaten. I’m still in pain.” “I’m exhausted and sad,” Abdel says of not being able to return to their home. The family is renting an apartment nearby now. “We don’t know what the future will hold,” he says. “Things are getting worse.” *Name changed for the subject’s safety",https://www.aljazeera.com/features/2025/10/15/israeli-arson-bulldozers-and-forced-labour-in-the-west-banks-tulkarem,World,aljazeera.com,Delaney Nolan,https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/GettyImages-2213004023-1-1760524380.jpg?resize=1920%2C1440,,ea037fd7eef68399aa792f845b6f7a0fb0737272

Nestled in the Johar Valley and surrounded by Himalayan peaks, the most notable being Nanda Devi, once considered the tallest mountain in the world, this village had traded sugar, lentils, spices, and cloth for salt and wool with Tibetans across the border. The nomadic inhabitants of several villages spent the winter months in the plains gathering goods to be traded with Tibetans in the summer. However, the border was sealed following an armed conflict between India and China in 1962, disrupting life in the high villages and leaving people with little incentive to return. Kishan Singh, 77, was 14 when he left with his family to settle in the lower village of Thal. He still returns to Martoli every summer to till the land and cultivate buckwheat, strawberries, and black cumin. His ancestral home has no roof, so he sleeps in a neighbour’s abandoned house during the six months he spends in this village. “I enjoy being in the mountains and the land here is very fertile,” he says. In late autumn, he hires mules to transport his harvest to his home in the plains, where he sells it at a modest profit. The largest of the Johar Valley villages had about 1,500 people at its peak in the early 1960s. Martoli had about 500 residents then, while some of the dozen or so other villages had 10 to 15 homes each. Now, only three or four people return to Martoli each summer. A few villagers are returning in summer to the nearby villages of Laspa, Ghanghar, and Rilkot, as they can now travel by vehicle to within a few kilometres (miles) of their villages on a recently built unpaved road. Among the scattered remnants of earlier stone houses in Martoli, a new guesthouse has appeared to cater for a few trekkers who pass through the village en route to the Nanda Devi Base Camp.",https://www.aljazeera.com/gallery/2025/10/15/life-slowly-returning-to-abandoned-himalayan-villages-in-india,World,aljazeera.com,,https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/AP25287262314540-1760515341.jpg?resize=1920%2C1440,,c20b51719ec055aac5e32dc34b4d6e3e8075d5ff
6d4d557f3e65,The AI Industry's Scaling Obsession Is Headed for a Cliff,"ai lab, artificial intelligence, machine learning, deep learning, ai, algorithms","A new study from MIT suggests the biggest and most computationally intensive AI models may soon offer diminishing returns compared to smaller models. By mapping scaling laws against continued improvements in model efficiency, the researchers found that it could become harder to wring leaps in performance from giant models whereas efficiency gains could make models running on more modest hardware increasingly capable over the next decade. “In the next five to 10 years, things are very likely to start narrowing,” says Neil Thompson, a computer scientist and professor at MIT involved in the study. Leaps in efficiency, like those seen with DeepSeek’s remarkably low-cost model in January, have already served as a reality check for the AI industry, which is accustomed to burning massive amounts of compute. As things stand, a frontier model from a company like OpenAI is currently much better than a model trained with a fraction of the compute from an academic lab. While the MIT team’s prediction might not hold if, for example, new training methods like reinforcement learning produce surprising new results, they suggest that big AI firms will have less of an edge in the future. Hans Gundlach, a research scientist at MIT who led the analysis, became interested in the issue due to the unwieldy nature of running cutting edge models. Together with Thompson and Jayson Lynch, another research scientist at MIT, he mapped out the future performance of frontier models compared to those built with more modest computational means. Gundlach says the predicted trend is especially pronounced for the reasoning models that are now in vogue, which rely more on extra computation during inference. Thompson says the results show the value of honing an algorithm as well as scaling up compute. “If you are spending a lot of money training these models, then you should absolutely be spending some of it trying to develop more efficient algorithms, because that can matter hugely,” he adds. The study is particularly interesting given today’s AI infrastructure boom (or should we say “bubble”?)—which shows little sign of slowing down. OpenAI and other US tech firms have signed hundred-billion-dollar deals to build AI infrastructure in the United States. “The world needs much more compute,” OpenAI’s president, Greg Brockman, proclaimed this week as he announced a partnership between OpenAI and Broadcom for custom AI chips. A growing number of experts are questioning the soundness of these deals. Roughly 60 percent of the cost of building a data center goes toward GPUs, which tend to depreciate quickly. Partnerships between the major players also appear circular and opaque .",https://www.wired.com/story/the-ai-industrys-scaling-obsession-is-headed-for-a-cliff,Technology,wired.com,Will Knight,,2025-10-15T18:00:00+00:00,8656f528d1675cfdf2e1632827d1a89949870f40
e67753725be1,These Comfortable Luxury Earbuds Are $100 Off,"shopping, deals, headphones, wireless earbuds, audio, earbuds","Looking for a pair of true wireless earbuds that pack a little more oomph than your average AirPods? The Beyerdynamic Amiron 300 (8/10, WIRED Review) are currently marked down to just $180 at Amazon , a full $100 off their list price, and the lowest price we've seen yet for these upgraded earbuds. The Amiron 300 have a classic Beyerdynamic sound profile, which is delightfully rich and smooth, with a mostly neutral base that has good definition at the far ends of the spectrum. Reviewer Parker Hall was particularly impressed with the vocal quality , which he called “clear and dynamic” and didn't get “overwhelmed by such a well-defined low end.” These are particularly good for jazz and vocal-heavy acoustic music, but anyone with good ears will be impressed with the performance. They also come with five different ear tips, so most people shouldn't have any trouble finding some that are a good fit, which also helps provide excellent sound isolation. That helps make up for the fact that the active noise canceling isn't quite as sharp as it is on earbuds from the likes of Sony or Bose. They do have excellent pass-through audio though, which could trick you into thinking there isn't any noise canceling on at all. There's a mobile app that's non-intrusive and useful, letting you change the functions of the buttons on the outside. As someone who constantly skips tracks by accident when pulling my hood up, I can appreciate the ability to tweak these settings. There are a variety of other options too, including an EQ to adjust, and a low latency mode if you want to use them to catch up on your favorite shows while riding the bus to work. Overall, these make for a nice upgrade from more budget-friendly true wireless earbuds, particularly for those with discerning ears and a penchant for vocal music or podcasts. Their understated design and great compatibility help round out an otherwise appealing package, and the lower price helps seal the deal.

fc670eac7d15,The Best Travel Tote for Digital Nomads Who Never Log Off,"bags, travel, air travel, shopping, buying guides, accessories and peripherals","Compare Top 6 Travel Totes More Travel Totes to Consider Aer Simple Tote for $139: Have you ever hefted a nylon or leather tote in your hand and realized that slinging it over your shoulder would give you immediate scoliosis? Then you want Aer’s ultra-lightweight, simple sailcloth tote, which weighs less than a pound. Its 15 liters felt surprisingly capacious. I fit two jackets inside on a walk with my kids, and the 3-inch-wide bag tucked neatly under my arm. The two exterior drop pockets fit my Nalgene and Kinto mug , and my phone fits neatly in the exterior zip pocket. The Fidlock closure, in addition to being pretty to look at and use, provided a bit of security but was much less, er, fiddly (sorry) than having to close the bag with a zipper. This is a great upgrade if you are getting tired of carrying everything in your shredded canvas tote from Umami Mart and want a bag that’s not going to get soaked in something questionable if you put it down in the wrong place on the subway. It is a little more expensive, though. —Adrienne So Cuyana System Tote 16-Inch for $358 : The Cuyana System Tote is a modular gear-hauler that shape-shifts with your itinerary. Designed to outlast the churn of fast fashion, this travel tote starts minimal, but the genius lies in its add-ons. A laptop sleeve or insert organizer creates a structure on the go, with dedicated slots for your computer, water bottle, and other work essentials. A System Flap Bag insert doubles as a clutch or in-bag organizer, and a detachable, adjustable strap (also available in a wide model ) converts the tote into a crossbody, perfect for hands-free airport sprints if you're unintentionally trying out airport theory . Instead of stitched-on straps prone to failure, the System Tote's handles are cut directly from its leather body, minimizing points of wear. The main compartment snaps shut rather than zips, something to know if you're the spill-averse type. Avoid This Tote Calpak Diaper Tote Bag with Laptop Sleeve for $195 : This bag was really puffy, but felt bulky, and space was lost to give the puffiness to the bag’s layers. It was somehow too big for everyday use, but not big enough when I needed a lot of stuff brought along for a day trip or long outings. It also didn’t really feel that diaper bag-centric; the only thing “diaper” about it was the baby wipe compartment on the outside, but I would have preferred an exterior pocket to store actual diapers along with it. You could stuff a couple of diapers in the flat front pocket, but it’s not as ideal as other designs I’ve tried. The insulated bottle pockets are handy if you travel with bottles, but feel useless after your baby graduates from bottles (which they graduate much earlier than diapers!) It’s not a bad bag, but I'd recommend a different design for parents and travelers alike. — Nena Farrell AccordionItemContainerButton To determine the best travel tote, we put each bag through real-world travel scenarios to see how it performs. That means packing it with laptops, chargers, clothes, and toiletries, testing comfort when worn over the shoulder or carried by hand. We'll overstuff the totes to check durability, organization, and accessibility. We'll evaluate how it fits under airplane seats, protects tech gear, and resists wear and weather. If it's supposedly water-resistant, we'll take it out in the rain to determine whether it survives without soaking its contents. We scrutinized every pocket, compartment, and zipper for usability. When it comes to design, we paid attention to the details: interior fabric choices that make contents easy to see, convenient pocket placement, and hardware choices like zippers and zipper pulls. We also paid attention to key design elements, such as the handle length and overall structure. We prioritized quality and sustainability, and we included eco-friendly brands for environmentally conscious consumers. We also made sure to include an array of fabrics for stylistic variability. Lastly, we considered how each bag stacked up against its price point, ensuring that the quality justified the cost. What Are We Testing Next?

34ce8c8b2ac8,The Best Noise-Canceling Headphones,"shopping, buying guides, headphones, wireless headphone, noise-canceling","Honorable Mentions Now that the majority of new headphones and earbuds offer at least a modicum of noise canceling, it'd be impossible (and unproductive) to list everything we like above. If you haven't yet found your fit, here are more favorites worth considering. Beyerdynamic Amiron 300 for $180 : These simple-looking earbuds are a great way to experience quiet luxury. They have 10 hours of battery life with noise canceling engaged, and they have some of the best-sounding drivers for vocals I’ve heard in any earbuds. Sony WF-1000XM5 Earbuds for $328 : Sony's fifth-generation flagship earbuds slim down while stepping up. These buds are smaller and slicker (maybe too slick when it comes to grabbing them) than the previous XM4 buds. As before, they provide great sound and noise canceling that outduels plenty of options, with a cost to match. In true Sony style, they serve up a truckload of adaptive features and EQ controls while retaining a solid eight hours of playback time per charge with ANC and 12 hours without it. —Ryan Waniata Soundcore Life Q30 for $60–$85 : Anker's Soundcore line is nothing if not value-conscious, and the Life Q30 provide an embarrassing list of extras for their bargain-basement pricing. You'll get clear and warm sound, great features, tons of battery life, and noise canceling that gets the job done even on a long flight, though it can't keep up with flagship pairs. It's hard to complain when they cost hundreds less, especially with sale pricing that sometimes drops to around $50. Sony WH-1000XM4 for $195 : Sony's WH-1000X lineup has produced some of the best noise-canceling headphones for nearly a decade, and the aging WH-1000XM4 are no exception. They periodically go on sale for under $300, but it's getting harder to find them below full price, which is tough for a five-year-old model. Bowers & Wilkins Pi8 Earbuds for $400 : Bowers & Wilkins' Pi8 offer a sleek, comfortable design, solid (albeit not Bose-beating) noise canceling, and great sound. Call quality is also excellent, which makes these perhaps the perfect business-class earbuds, though their hefty price won't appeal to everyone. Bowers and Wilkins PX7 S2e for $400: The Px7 S2e feature upgraded audio quality for fantastic sound in stylish and sophisticated design. They're also among the most comfortable headphones we've tested, but their noise canceling doesn't rise to the level of the top players for the money. Beyerdynamic Aventho 300 for $280 : These over-ears from Beyerdynamic have the brand's classic studio sound, with a tight crisp high range and punchy lows. The downside is that they don't cancel noise quite as well as models from Sony, Bose, and others above. Still, they sound great and are worth considering, especially if you can snag them on sale. Soundcore Space A40 for $60 : Another top value buy from Anker's Soundcore brand, the Space A40 are some of our favorite cheap earbuds, especially as their price continues to fall. You'll find a classy design, lots of features, quality sound, and great noise canceling for their class. Apple Beats Fit Pro for $170 : The Beats Fit Pro are an aging but still knockout pair of wireless buds, with great sound, easy-access physical buttons, and solid noise canceling to boot. Add to that six hours of battery life, spatial audio compatibility with Apple Music and other services, and you've got one of the best pairs of earbuds ever “designed in California.” Epos/Sennheiser Adapt 660 for $301 : Want excellent sound, a comfortable fit, and high-quality noise-canceling tech for less than what you'd pay for Sony or Bose headphones? Check out this collaboration between Epos and Sennheiser. The Epos/Sennheiser Adapt 660 sound fantastic and are some of the lightest noise-canceling headphones I've ever worn. They also feature excellent microphones for great silence on calls and Zooms. Power up with unlimited access to WIRED .

Instead, there's just one new model: a 14-inch MacBook Pro with four storage options (512 GB, 1 TB, 2 TB, or 4 TB) and three unified memory options (16, 24, or 32 GB). The base version starts at $1,599, like before, but if you max out all of the upgrades, it can cost as much as $3,369. We'll likely see M5 Pro and M5 Max chip options in 2026 alongside a 16-inch MacBook Pro. You'll see similar speed increases like on the iPad Pro M5—3.5X faster AI performance, 1.6X faster graphics over the prior M4-powered MacBook Pro, and 2X faster SSD performance. Otherwise, this is the same 14-inch MacBook as before, with the claimed “24-hour” battery life, mini-LED display with the nano-texture glass option, a six-speaker system, and a 12-MP webcam. There are three Thunderbolt 4 ports, an HDMI, an SDXC slot, a headphone jack, and the MagSafe charging port. COURTESY OF APPLE The New Vision Pro Widely regarded as a miss with consumers, Apple's Vision Pro mixed-reality headset is back but with no major changes to the hardware. Well, there's a new head strap: the Dual Knit Band. It's included in the box, and Apple says it's soft and cushioned, allowing for a comfier fit. The headset is now powered by the M5 chip, which enables faster performance, sharper details throughout visionOS 26, and better battery life. Specifically, Apple says the M5 renders 10 percent more pixels on the micro-OLED displays than before, and the refresh rate can also jump up to 120 Hz . Battery life is now two and a half hours of general use, as opposed to just two hours on the original Vision Pro . That extends to three hours with video playback.

Some items get used once before disappearing into a closet, while others barely leave your side.

a71f7c635106,Federal Workers Are Being Used as Pawns in the Shutdown,"inner loop, politics, government, doge, donald trump, republicans","Federal workers have grown accustomed to a specific kind of dread over the past year . 2025 has been nonstop: First came the “ fork ” email from Elon Musk’s so-called Department of Government Efficiency, followed quickly by numerous layoffs from the Trump administration. As of July, more than 150,000 federal workers had resigned from their roles since president Donald Trump took office for the second time, according to The Washington Post . Tens of thousands were also fired. For the past few months, it seemed like this bloodletting was over—but that all changed on Friday. Thousands of employees at eight government agencies were subjected to RIFs, or reductions in force—the government’s formal process of laying off federal workers. According to a court filing from the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) on Friday, this latest round of firings has affected more than 4,000 federal employees. The court filing also claimed that the administration targeted the Treasury and the Department of Health and Human Services the hardest, hacking away at a combined 2,500 jobs across the two agencies and the entire Washington, DC, office of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention . The Department of Education culled nearly its entire team handling special education, CNN reported on Tuesday . At the Environmental Protection Agency, the Department of Energy, and the Department of Housing and Urban Development, cuts ranged from a few dozen to several hundred jobs , according to the same filing. Every Day Is an Adventure “People are scared. Who says their goal is to traumatize people?” says one IRS worker, referencing private speeches given by Russell Vought , the head of OMB and a key architect of the Heritage Foundation’s Project 2025 who has been the public face of the job-cutting. ”If any normal human said ‘My goal is to traumatize families’ there should be police at that person's doorstep.” “It’s pretty demoralizing,” a Food and Drug Administration employee tells WIRED. “It’s clear this admin will act illegally to try to make agencies or offices they don’t like suffer more.” (The Trump administration has used government resources, like websites, to place blame on Democrats for the shutdown in what critics claim is a violation of the Hatch Act , a law forbidding the use of public assets for political messaging.) “Every day is an adventure: new EOs, new memos,” says one Department of Homeland Security worker. “It’s constantly being on watch on where to pivot and what to stop, start, and sustain.” (All of these employees have been granted anonymity so they can speak candidly about their experiences.)",https://www.wired.com/story/federal-workers-are-being-used-as-pawns-in-the-shutdown,Technology,wired.com,Makena Kelly,"https://media.wired.com/photos/68eec7721c48a61c72f2c125/191:100/w_1280,c_limit/politics_federal_layoffs_pawns.jpg",2025-10-15T13:31:57.508000+00:00,7aea35505ef693fd2f9350966ad13709a9a2bec9
2ca15e1e9709,Review: SteelSeries Arctis Nova 3 Gaming Headset,"shopping, review, video games, reviews, headphones, gaming, online gaming","There's a downside, though, and it isn't minor: Once Sonar is running, you’ll need to keep your system’s default audio device set to one of the new outputs the app creates during installation. If you switch between speakers and headphones, changing the device in your system tray won’t work anymore, you can only do it in the GG app. There’s also no main Sonar output, so you’ll have to choose one of the groups as your default system output, and then your system volume controls will only affect programs assigned to that category . To make matters more confusing, there’s a volume wheel on the Nova 3 that runs independently of everything else. I’m really impressed with how much practical value the app offers, but I’m more than a little frustrated with how my system audio settings look, even when I’m using my desktop speakers. I've been able to find some workarounds to keep my main volume knob working, but it feels like it shouldn't need to be this complicated. It’s a shame, because I've grown really fond of the app, but having to navigate into a specific piece of software to change my speaker volume is a little annoying. Conclusion Photograph: Brad Bourque The Arctis Nova 3 are one of my favorite gaming headsets, but the software is going to be a deal-breaker for some folks. They provide an awesome amount of practical value, but you have to make some concessions. I know how much people don't like their system settings screwed with, something I think I'm more tolerant of than average, and it still bothers me. Just know the mobile app has a subset of features, and it's all upside for console gamers. I find the Nova 3 so comfortable, and their sound so impressive for the price, that I’m willing to overlook the loss of my mute button. They have a great sound profile that’s only improved by the equalizer profiles, long battery life with quick charging, and excellent system compatibility, all at a very reasonable price. Even with the much more premium Arctis Nova Pro at my desk, I often find myself reaching for the Nova 3, and that says a lot.",https://www.wired.com/review/steelseries-arctis-nova-3-review,Technology,wired.com,Brad Bourque,"https://media.wired.com/photos/68eece76eadc50eb0ecc741e/191:100/w_1280,c_limit/Review-%20SteelSeries%20Arctis%20Nova%203%20Gaming%20Headset.png",2025-10-15T10:33:00-04:00,38d454c310420cfa00a2c2babd7a971f4592be59
69ce28f924c1,The Best Swimming Headphones,"fitness, health, wearables, sports, swimming","Most, if not all, swimming headphones play music through streaming audio files from a built-in music player. Some also offer the option of streaming over Bluetooth, which is mainly present to make the headphones more useful when you’re back on dry land. You have to store files on the headphones themselves, because Bluetooth and water don’t really mix. The frequency on which Bluetooth operates is absorbed by water, which in turn impacts signal strength. If you've ever attempted to stream music with swimming headphones, this is why you probably got regular connection dropouts. You will typically be able to send music to your headphones by using the same cable that you use to charge it. You will have to plug it into your computer to send files to your headphones, unless the headphones offer the ability to sync files from a companion smartphone app. You’ll then need to drag and drop audio files into folders; audio file format support can vary by headphone. Make sure you check which formats the headphones support before you hit the Buy button! To use swimming headphones, you should already own audio or be able to download it legally. This could apply to some podcasts and audiobooks. Can swimming headphones let you play music from streaming services like Spotify? Well, not really, That’s because most audio on streaming services is protected by DRM (digital rights management). Some headphones do offer some workarounds, with some solutions working better than others.",https://www.wired.com/gallery/best-swimming-headphones,Technology,wired.com,Michael Sawh,"https://media.wired.com/photos/68eeab650f54bf28d8db74ff/191:100/w_1280,c_limit/Best%20Swimming%20Headphones.png",2025-10-15T14:00:00+00:00,54f1f7679ecf21b997702521b2f2ffa9bdc99840
0b9d782f78bd,Everything You Need to Know About MVNOs and Prepaid Phone Plans,"shopping, phones, smartphones, wireless, mobile, verizon, t-mobile, at&t, telecoms, networks","MVNOs aren’t forthcoming about these limitations, but you can find them spelled out in policy documentation. Let’s look at Mint Mobile’s network management policy as an example. The first hurdle is deprioritization. “Other brands may be prioritized higher on the T-Mobile network,” reads Mint’s network management policy. “For all Service plans, T-Mobile may also reduce speeds during times of network congestion.” These policies aren’t clear about how severe the slowdown is, but generally, if a network has a lot of congestion, MVNOs will see slower speeds before those on major carriers. In most parts of the country, this isn’t a problem. However, you’ll likely experience slower speeds in major cities and at large events. If you're at a concert and everyone is trying to post Instagram stories and TikToks, you'll probably notice a significant slowdown. Another downside with most MVNOs is throttling. You’ll be able to purchase an “unlimited” data plan, but there are usually soft caps to the amount of data you can use before speeds slow. Again using Mint as an example, it classifies “heavy data users” as those who use more than 35 GB of data in a month, and it says these users will “have their data usage prioritized below the data usage (including tethering) of other customers at times and at locations where there are competing customer demands for network resources, which may result in slower data speeds.” Those are the two big drawbacks, but some smaller limitations pop up depending on the provider you look at. Mint, for instance, uses “video optimization,” which basically means video streams are capped at standard definition when using mobile data (480p). This happens automatically on the network, even if you’re trying to stream a higher resolution. I’m using Mint as a touchstone here, but these practices are common among most MVNOs. Cricket has similar data restrictions and video limitations as does Optimum Mobile . Major carriers that have direct prepaid plans, like T-Mobile, generally have higher data limits before reducing speeds. Outside of those limitations, some MVNOs don’t offer additional cellular features like roaming or a mobile hot spot. Those limitations aren’t universal, but they’re some good things to look out for when you’re looking at providers and plans. Can You Use the Same Number With a Prepaid Mobile Plan? The US Federal Communications Commission (FCC) determined decades ago that phone providers don’t own phone numbers. Broadly, you’re allowed to keep your number when transferring to a new carrier, regardless of whether that’s a prepaid or postpaid carrier. In fact, since 2009, the FCC requires carriers to transfer—or, more properly, “port”—your number within one business day. Under the FCC’s rules , a carrier can’t deny porting your number, even if you refuse to pay a porting fee. However, porting fees are allowed. Some carriers, such as T-Mobile, don’t have any fees for porting your number. Others charge anywhere from a few dollars to $20.",https://www.wired.com/story/prepaid-phone-plans-and-mvnos,Technology,wired.com,Jacob Roach,"https://media.wired.com/photos/68eecb0a0f54bf28d8db7501/191:100/w_1280,c_limit/visible-Credit-Jacob-Roach.jpg",2025-10-15T13:30:00+00:00,29198654201008457213ee271014617a50417d1f
7580a81aaf79,Review: ROG Xbox Ally and ROG Xbox Ally X,"video games, console games, xbox, reviews, shopping, microsoft, asus, review, gaming, portable gaming","However, because the X-ROGs are fundamentally regular PCs, they’re a lot more versatile than Nintendo or Valve’s efforts. Not only can you play media, browse, or do anything else you might do on a PC (even Office tasks, if you hate joy), but you can install any other PC gaming client—Steam, Epic, GOG, and more are all available. Better still, the Xbox app aggregates all games installed on the system into one library view, regardless of where they originate. You can even turn your ROG Xbox into an ersatz Steam Deck by running Steam in Big Picture mode (although some of its controller keybindings may not work). The big win—pardon the pun—is that you can install mods with ease. While I’ve gotten a few mods running on my Steam Deck over the years, its Linux underbelly makes things trickier. On the X-ROGs, I’ve been able to use mods as easily as on my main gaming desktop, with no second-guessing if they’ll actually work. It’s a great feature that’s facilitated by having standard Windows as the base. Soft Where? But wait, there’s a third UI player in the mix: Asus’ own Armoury Crate SE software. Broadly, this is more of a device manager, with a dedicated button on both consoles to bring up a Command Center quick menu. This allows you to instantly switch power profiles, create custom control inputs, or set frame rate limits. It also offers a real-time monitor displaying useful system information like temperature, CPU and GPU performance, battery level and power drain, and the current frame rate. However, fully open Armoury Crate and you’ll find an array of far deeper controls, from granular system settings to tweaking color profiles of the LED rings that sit under each thumbstick. It also has its own Update Center—yet another to check—and its own unified library, distinct from the Xbox app’s. After a week with the X-ROGs, I’m finally familiar with where functions live, but the learning curve is steep, and having essentially three central interfaces—Xbox, Windows, Armoury Crate—for a single device is ridiculous.",https://www.wired.com/review/review-xbox-rog-ally-and-rog-ally-x,Technology,wired.com,Matt Kamen,"https://media.wired.com/photos/68eec838eadc50eb0ecc7418/191:100/w_1280,c_limit/Review-%20Xbox%20ROG%20Ally%20X.png",2025-10-15T09:00:00-04:00,2da30c7d915a42349083b0636a054e724fb33766
26ef4302c103,The Best Résumé Builders to Land a New Job,"buying guides, shopping, software, jobs, work, office, how-to","I knew almost immediately after I started using FlowCV that it’d earn a spot on this list. It’s everything you want out of a résumé builder. It has excellent templates, plenty of customization, tools for tracking and modifying existing CVs, and a web application that doesn’t chug or sputter out when you’re working on a design. And, unlike a lot of résumé builders, FlowCV lets you design, download, and print a résumé and cover letter for free. You can start from scratch or upload an existing résumé (either PDF or raw text), and from there, FlowCV will walk you through each section of your CV. These sections are customizable, and they don’t lock you into a particular template. Some résumés may want a section for languages, while others want you to list awards. You can add or remove sections as needed, and you won’t break the formatting on the template (it happens more often than you think). Managing everything from sections makes customizing your résumé much easier. Instead of sliding around disparate text boxes and trying to line everything up perfectly, FlowCV will automatically update the layout as you change sections. For instance, I was using a two-column template for my résumé, but there was way too much information in the right column, causing my résumé to sprawl out across two pages. I was able to drag some sections over to the left column to balance the layout, and FlowCV automatically ensured everything was lined up and spaced properly. It’s this high-level customization that makes FlowCV so great. You can easily make broad changes without getting into specific text boxes or design elements. For example, there’s an option to automatically flip your job title and employer based on what you want to list first. FlowCV is my favorite résumé builder, but customizing a CV is only scratching the surface of what it can do. There are also templates for cover letters, email signatures, and online résumé websites. My favorite addition is a Kanban board. It's like Trello , but built directly into FlowCV, and it allows you to track jobs and their status as you move through the process. You get one résumé and one cover letter for free, no strings attached. However, I recommend the Basic plan for most people, which includes three résumés, 20 cover letters, along with the online résumé feature and Kanban board. FlowCV doesn’t focus on AI writing as much as other résumé builders, but if that’s something you’re after, you can unlock AI features with the Pro+ plan, which also includes unlimited résumé and cover letters.",https://www.wired.com/gallery/best-resume-builders,Technology,wired.com,Jacob Roach,"https://media.wired.com/photos/68eeae717c200f52288c73c6/191:100/w_1280,c_limit/W1102806-Credit-Jacob-Roach.JPG",2025-10-15T12:30:00+00:00,4f9b18324de643c80a4a023a461ed9fe76639687
570e27b89a40,The Best Pet Cameras,"buying guides, shopping, privacy, smart home, home, pets, cats, dogs, security camera, cameras, camera","Compare Our Picks Others Tested Photograph: Molly Higgins Enabot Rola PetPal Robot Pet Companion for $199 (with no attachments) : This rolling pet camera has the best of intentions, but the sometimes glitchy app makes the combo pet camera/toy/feeder a little unpredictable. Through the app, you can watch your pets on the security cam and drive the robot around, pressing buttons to do tricks and dispense treats. You can watch the camera feed live from the app, but you can also schedule recordings, which are viewable via Cloud Playback, and it compiles a 30-second “day in the life” compilation. The robot is also supposed to detect abnormal movement or sounds, like barking or broken glass, and send a smart alert to the owner with a timestamp while away from home. Through AI-powered pet recognition, the bot can also snap a picture of your pet, but the AI features were unreliable. Petcube Cam for $32 : This simple, compact camera doesn't have all the bells and whistles, but it’s a great price for being a reliable, basic pet camera. Like others in Petcube's lineup, it has a 1080p HD camera, night vision, and two-way audio. It sits on hinges and can angle upward and downward, with the option to flip the video feed in-app if you want to lay it horizontally. You'll need the brand's subscription Care plan to get any features beyond live feed. You can set a “motion zone” to only get notifications in a specific area, and you connect your phone's location to the app, so that you're alerted more often when away. You can also share the camera feed with others so they can watch remotely and only specify certain times you want shared. This camera is basic, but it has a high-quality camera feed and advanced extras that make it a steal at this price. Photograph: Molly Higgins Catit Pixi Smart Mouse Camera for $90 : This cutie looks like a miniature mouse with oversized, magnetic feet that attach to a metal stand, and the mouse legs hinge so you can adjust the camera's height and angle. It's cute but expensive for what it is—the lens doesn't move and requires microSD to get video footage beyond a live feed (with the SD card, you can scroll through the video to see the goings-on from past days, record live footage, and save photos and videos to your smartphone’s camera roll). Although it was hard to pinpoint exactly which time you're looking at when reviewing footage, video feed can be laggy, and there were connectivity issues a few times. It's a tad expensive at this price point for its (lack of) capabilities. Closer Pets TreatView with Pet Camera for $100 : This solid pet cam features an HD camera, two-way communication, motion detection, a built-in memory card, and 1-cup storage for kibble or treats, which can be scheduled or given at random. The video feed was always crystal clear, although sound was a bit laggy and hard to hear well. The treat portions were huge, dispensing a heaping handful of kibble at even the lowest setting. The alert sound when dispensing is super jarring, and my pets were scared of it—there was no way to silence it. Because of the placement of the hole for dispensing kibble, the camera is angled low, which made it hard to see the area I wanted. This is a solid pet camera whose additional features become a burden rather than an asset. AccordionItemContainerButton Keeping the criteria in mind above, I looked for security cameras that had extra pet-specific features. I set up each camera individually, noting any difficulty or issues with initial setup, configuration with Wi-Fi, and speed and reliability of the camera feed. I tested each camera for at least a week (most, much longer) in various spots around my house and rigorously tested the extra features available on most of the cameras, like scheduled feedings, food-dispensing, playtime, and scheduled recordings, and I noted any issues. Over the months of testing, I went out of town several times and completely relied on these cams to keep an eye on my two children—I mean, cats. So, Is There Really a Difference Between Security Cameras and Pet Cameras? Sort Of AccordionItemContainerButton Security cameras enable you to watch your house (and pet) while you're away, but pet cameras often have a few more pet-specific features, like dispensing treats or abilities to interact with your pet via two-way speaker. These cameras with special features can help ease common issues like separation anxiety or boredom. The Enabot Rola PetPal Robot Pet Companion , for example, has attachments so you can remotely give your pet a treat or engage in “playtime."" That's not to say that you can't use a security camera as a pet cam, but like any other smart home device that connects to Wi-Fi, there's a chance it can be hacked and compromise your privacy. Make sure your Wi-Fi password is strong, set up two-factor authentication with your camera's app, and it's not a bad idea to keep it turned off when you're home, as an extra precaution.

7a865c9ea808,A New Road Safety Group Targets Self-Driving Cars,"tesla, robotaxis, self-driving cars, autonomous vehicles, policy, traffic","A new advocacy group is pushing state lawmakers to pass more stringent autonomous vehicle regulations. The group, Safe Autonomous Vehicles Everywhere in the United States (SAVE-US), says its goal is to ensure that new self-driving technology will save lives instead of doing harm. Its work has a clear target: Tesla . The campaign , announced on Wednesday, counts among its goals passing legislation that would require tech developers to be clearer about the limits of their driving technology; report more specific and public crash information to states; and use multiple sensors on their vehicles. In the US, regulations governing autonomous vehicles are generally handled by the states, whose laws range from stringent (California) to relatively permissive (Arizona, Texas). Fourteen US states don’t have autonomous-vehicle-related laws at all. The group will initially target lawmakers in large states, including Illinois, New York, and New Jersey, says Shua Sanchez, the group’s national campaign director. Sanchez and Bob Somers, SAVE-US’s technical adviser, met this summer outside an administrative hearing in Oakland, California. Inside, attorneys for California's Department of Motor Vehicles argued that Tesla should temporarily lose its license to manufacture and sell vehicles in the state because, they alleged, the electric automaker had falsely advertised its Full Self-Driving and Autopilot driver assistance features. Sanchez, a physicist, had been following Tesla closely since he got involved in the Tesla Takedown movement earlier this year, leading demonstrations outside of a showroom in Boston to protest CEO Elon Musk’s involvement with the so-called Department of Government Efficiency . Somers had worked as an engineer at the self-driving vehicle developer Zoox for half a decade. (He’s since left the autonomous vehicle industry.) In Oakland, they agreed: Autonomous vehicle technology has the potential to save lives. But rushing the technology, or confusing customers about its limits, is unsafe and could doom the whole project. (An administrative judge is due to decide on the Tesla case later this year.) ""It's fair to say that Tesla is the worst actor in this space, but that definitely doesn't mean every other company is a perfect actor either,” says Sanchez. “If we don't have good regulations in place, we leave the door open for any company to pursue an unsafe path.” Unlike many of its competitors, which use pricier radars and lidars plus cameras, Tesla depends on vision-only software, arguing that more effective cameras and AI-trained software alone can safely pilot its vehicles. The tech strategy is at the center of one of Tesla’s chief promises: That one day, the cars it has already manufactured will be able to completely drive themselves thanks to a quick software update. Competitors, including Waymo and Zoox, use more expensive and purpose-built robotaxis to pull off their autonomous rides. Last week, the US federal government said it had opened an investigation of Tesla’s Full Self-Driving (Supervised) driver assistance software following reports that the feature, which is not autonomous and must be supervised by a driver behind the wheel, ran red lights and drove on the wrong side of the street.",https://www.wired.com/story/road-safety-group-save-us-targets-self-driving-cars,Technology,wired.com,Aarian Marshall,"https://media.wired.com/photos/68ed64b64991e2f0569dd36d/191:100/w_1280,c_limit/gear-tesla-robotaxi-2220873143.jpg",2025-10-15T11:00:00+00:00,f879094fac1b9857b3389962aea0e5e812f4538c

It provides 30 days of event history from your compatible home security cameras and doorbells , intelligent alerts (including familiar faces and package detection), Gemini for Home so you can use Gemini Live on your speakers and displays, and the ability to create smart home automations by typing what you want in the Google Home app. Google Home Premium Advanced : This plan costs $20 per month or $200 per year (£16 or £160 in the UK), but is also included as part of the AI Ultra Plan. It ups video history to 60 days, allows 24/7 video for 10 days, provides descriptive notifications, video history search, event descriptions, and daily summaries. YouTube Premium Subscribers get access to Google's music streaming service , YouTube videos are ad-free, and you can save videos for offline viewing, among other YouTube Premium perks . Included as part of the AI Ultra plan, this perk is for an individual YouTube Premium plan. Fitbit Premium Folks in the UK subscribing to the AI Pro Plan (and above) starting from £19 per month, also get Fitbit Premium bundled in. This gives you advanced insights, personalized workouts, and stress management, among other features. Extra Benefits A couple of things fall into this category: Google Play Credits : You will occasionally get credits to redeem in the Play Store for books, movies, apps, or games. The amount and frequency vary. Discounts, Trials, and Other Perks : You may get offers for discounted Google services or hardware, extended free trials of Google services, and other perks (for example, Google offered everyone upgrading to a 2-TB plan a free Nest Mini). These offers pop up and disappear seemingly at random. How to Subscribe to Google One If you want to sign up, it’s easy.

d8c1fa142a08,When Face Recognition Doesn’t Know Your Face Is a Face,"artificial intelligence, algorithms, machine learning, privacy, ethics, regulation, face recognition","“If you don’t include people with disabilities or people with facial differences in the development of these processes, no one’s going to think of these issues,” says Kathleen Bogart, a psychology professor at Oregon State University who specializes in disability research and lives with a facial difference. “AI has amplified these issues, but it’s rooted in long-standing underrepresentation and prejudice towards people with facial differences that occurred long before AI was a thing.” Too Little, Too Late When face verification systems fail, it’s often hard to find help—piling more pressure on a stressful situation. For months, Maryland resident Noor Al-Khaled has struggled to create an online account with the Social Security Administration. Al-Khaled, who lives with the rare cranio-facial condition Ablepheron Macrostomia , says having an online account would allow her to easily access SSA records and quickly send documents to the agency. “I don’t drive because of my vision; I should be able to rely on the site,” Al-Khaled says. “You have to take a selfie, and the pictures have to match,” Al-Khaled says. “Because of the facial difference, I don't know if it’s not recognizing the ID or the selfie, but it’s always saying images don’t match.” Not having that access makes life harder. “On an emotional level, it just makes me feel shut out from society,” she explains. Al-Khaled says that all services should provide alternative ways for people to access online systems. “The lack of other fallback options means that sometimes people get trapped in these labyrinths of technological systems,” says Byrum from Present Moment Enterprises. An SSA spokesperson says alternative options to face verification are available, and it is “committed” to making its services accessible to everyone. The agency, the spokesperson says, does not run facial recognition systems itself but uses Login.gov and ID.me for verification services. The General Services Administration, which runs Login.gov, did not respond to WIRED’s request for comment. “Accessibility is a core priority for ID.me,” a spokesperson for ID.me says, adding it has previously helped people with facial differences and offered to directly help Al-Khaled after WIRED was in touch. “There are few things more dehumanizing than being told by a machine that you’re not real because of your face,” says Corey R. Taylor , a New York–based actor and motivational speaker who lives with a craniofacial anomaly. Last year, Taylor says, he was using a financial app to access a small amount of money; as he tried to complete the payment processes, he found that the face verification system could not match his selfie to the image on his ID. To get the system to work, he had to move into different positions. “I had to literally raise my eyes and contort my face,” Taylor says. When he emailed the company, he got what appeared to be a boilerplate response.",https://www.wired.com/story/when-face-recognition-doesnt-know-your-face-is-a-face,Technology,wired.com,Matt Burgess,"https://media.wired.com/photos/68d2b8a6ec02cfea46385bf5/191:100/w_1280,c_limit/FacialRecognition_Illo.png",2025-10-15T09:30:00+00:00,eb4d6e8eff3db862d28539fd415eac389af8efc2
1f046707f553,Waymo’s Robotaxis Are Coming to London,"self-driving cars, google, autonomous vehicles, uber, robotaxis, waymo","Waymo is expanding to London, the self-driving vehicle developer announced on Wednesday. The Google sister company aims to start service next year, when the UK government plans to allow autonomous vehicles to begin operating on its roads in limited pilot programs. Waymo says it’s working with the government to receive the necessary permissions for its launch. This is only Waymo ’s second venture outside the United States—though could be its first international robotaxi service. The company has been testing robotaxis in Tokyo since April , where it works with Japanese taxi company Nihon Kotsu, whose drivers are helping Waymo map and collect driving data from the city, and Japanese ride-hail firm GO. However, the company won’t say when it plans to launch autonomous taxis in Japan. London could prove the company’s biggest challenge yet. Unlike more car-oriented cities in the US, London’s streets are more winding and narrow, the city's layout a legacy of its pre-Roman and medieval history. “We will take the same rigorous approach to testing and deploying in London as we have in other cities before offering rides to the public,” Waymo spokesperson Ethan Teicher wrote in an email. He says Waymo’s experience in Tokyo will help its software drive in London. Waymo operates paid taxi service in five US cities: Phoenix, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Austin, and Atlanta. (It operates the latter two services through the Uber app.) It has announced plans to launch in Dallas, Miami, Nashville, and Washington, DC, next year. It has also received a permit to test autonomous vehicles in New York City, though it must do so with a safety driver behind the wheel. The company says it has provided more than 10 million paid rides since it picked up its first customers in 2020. Waymo’s move follows the UK government’s announcement this spring that it would accelerate by more than a year its plans to allow autonomous vehicle tech on public roads. The government now aims to begin permitting robotaxis to operate in small numbers starting in 2026. Government officials intend to spend about a year studying the data those vehicles produce before allowing companies to more widely launch driverless taxi services in the second half of 2027. Homegrown British autonomous vehicle developer Wayve has already announced it will work with Uber to operate robotaxis in London. UK secretary of state for transport Heidi Alexander said in a statement that she was “delighted” about Waymo’s plans. “Boosting the [autonomous vehicle] sector will increase accessible transport options alongside bringing jobs, investment, and opportunities to the UK,” she said. Waymo says it will work with fleet-operations firm Moove to run an eventual London fleet. Moove will help manage and dispatch Waymo’s electric ride-hail vehicles, and will maintain and operate the service’s maintenance and charging depots. Moove is also working with Waymo in Phoenix, and eventually, Miami.",https://www.wired.com/story/waymos-robotaxis-are-coming-to-london,Technology,wired.com,Aarian Marshall,"https://media.wired.com/photos/68ed65faa996be3605822787/191:100/w_1280,c_limit/gear-waymo-2085252384.jpg",2025-10-15T09:00:00+00:00,362c6dadb800a0ddc1424f995c1873d6c2bd149d
74ac19053910,SpaceX’s Second-Gen Starship Signs Off With a Near-Perfect Test Flight,"ars technica, science, space, spacex, elon musk","In the closing moments of Monday’s flight, Starship flexed its flaps to perform a “dynamic banking maneuver” over the Indian Ocean, then flipped upright and fired its engines to slow for splashdown, simulating maneuvers the rocket will execute on future missions returning to the launch site. That will be one of the chief goals for the next phase of Starship’s test campaign beginning next year. Patience for V3 It will likely be at least a few months before SpaceX is ready to launch the next Starship flight. Technicians at Starbase are assembling the next Super Heavy booster and the first Starship V3 vehicle. Once integrated, the booster and ship are expected to undergo cryogenic testing and static-fire testing before SpaceX moves forward with launch. “Focus now turns to the next generation of Starship and Super Heavy, with multiple vehicles currently in active build and preparing for tests,” SpaceX wrote on its website. “This next iteration will be used for the first Starship orbital flights, operational payload missions, propellant transfer, and more as we iterate to a fully and rapidly reusable vehicle with service to Earth orbit, the Moon, Mars, and beyond.” Starship V3 will have larger propellant tanks to increase the rocket’s lifting capacity, upgraded Raptor 3 engines, and an improved payload compartment to support launches of real Starlink satellites. SpaceX will also use this version of the rocket for orbital refueling experiments, a long-awaited milestone for the Starship program now planned for sometime next year. Orbital refueling is a crucial enabler for future Starship flights beyond low Earth orbit and is necessary for SpaceX to fulfill Musk’s ambition to send ships to Mars, the founder’s long-held goal for the company. It’s also required for Starship flights to the moon. NASA has signed contracts with SpaceX worth more than $4 billion to develop a human-rated derivative of Starship to land astronauts on the moon as part of the agency’s Artemis program. The orbital refueling demonstration is a key milestone on the NASA lunar lander contract. Getting this done as soon as possible is vitally important to NASA , which is seeing its Artemis moon-landing schedule slip, in part due to Starship delays.",https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/10/after-year-of-hardships-spacexs-starship-finally-flirts-with-perfection,Technology,arstechnica.com,"Stephen Clark, Ars Technica","https://media.wired.com/photos/68ee74d35e55b3e41cfee209/191:100/w_1280,c_limit/GettyImages-2240504914.jpg",2025-10-15T07:00:00+00:00,1cfbd3ee0ce97709e7b692301675de551e42cb76

217c3ad184f3,A Quarter of the CDC Is Gone,"cdc, robert f. kennedy jr., public health, government","After the latest round of mass firings at the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention over the weekend, the union that represents agency employees estimates that around 3,000 people this year—about a quarter of the agency’s workforce—have departed the agency. That number includes workers affected by layoffs earlier this year , as well those who have accepted the Trump administration’s “Fork in the Road” buyout program. The most recent cuts came down amid the ongoing government shutdown. On October 10, more than 1,300 CDC employees received termination notices. Soon after, however, about 700 of those people were told via email that they were mistakenly terminated and were not in fact subject to the reduction in force. An estimated 600 people remain terminated. An additional 1,300 CDC employees are, according to the union, on administrative leave and being paid but not working. The Trump administration has not shared official numbers of those targeted by the reductions. The estimate was compiled by the American Federation of Government Employees (AFGE) Local 2883, which represents CDC workers. The current round of reductions affects the National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion, the National Center for Health Statistics, the CDC library, the agency’s human resources department, campus safety staff, as well as the CDC’s office in Washington, DC, which acts as a liaison to Congress and provides public health information to policymakers. “All HHS employees receiving reduction-in-force notices were designated nonessential by their respective divisions,” Andrew Nixon, director of communication at the Department of Health and Human Services, told WIRED via email. Among those reinstated include staff that publish the agency’s flagship publication, the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report, as well as leadership in the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases and National Center for Emerging and Zoonotic Infectious Diseases, according to AFGE. Members of the Epidemic Intelligence Service, the CDC’s “disease detectives” unit, were also brought back. The CDC has been in turmoil since HHS secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. took office in February. In addition to carrying out mass layoffs, Kennedy is attempting to upend established vaccine policy. Earlier this year, he removed all 17 sitting members of a federal vaccine advisory committee, replacing them with members of his choosing. Several are vaccine skeptics and have been critical of public health measures taken during the Covid-19 pandemic. In August, Kennedy fired CDC director Susan Monarez, who had been in the position for just a month. Monarez told a Senate committee in September that Kennedy demanded she sign off on new vaccine recommendations “regardless of the scientific evidence” and dismiss career officials without cause. During her short time at the CDC, a gunman opened fire on the agency’s Atlanta campus and killed a police officer who responded to the shooting.",https://www.wired.com/story/cdc-terminations-workforce-shutdown-rifs,Technology,wired.com,Emily Mullin,"https://media.wired.com/photos/68ee7c1021984a45f842f29d/191:100/w_1280,c_limit/GettyImages-1570746389.jpg",2025-10-14T21:51:41.513000+00:00,16c79e6e7a51dd8d5bce7f51e7f1f19bb342ff07
98d250a7e3fe,A New Attack Lets Hackers Steal 2-Factor Authentication Codes From Android Phones,"ars technica, cybersecurity, hacking, malware, vulnerabilities, security, hacks, android, google, samsung","Android devices are vulnerable to a new attack that can covertly steal two-factor authentication codes, location timelines, and other private data in less than 30 seconds. The new attack, named Pixnapping by the team of academic researchers who devised it, requires a victim to first install a malicious app on an Android phone or tablet. The app, which requires no system permissions, can then effectively read data that any other installed app displays on the screen. Pixnapping has been demonstrated on Google Pixel phones and the Samsung Galaxy S25 phone and likely could be modified to work on other models with additional work. Google released mitigations last month, but the researchers said a modified version of the attack works even when the update is installed. Like Taking a Screenshot Pixnapping attacks begin with the malicious app invoking Android programming interfaces that cause the authenticator or other targeted apps to send sensitive information to the device screen. The malicious app then runs graphical operations on individual pixels of interest to the attacker. Pixnapping then exploits a side channel that allows the malicious app to map the pixels at those coordinates to letters, numbers, or shapes. “Anything that is visible when the target app is opened can be stolen by the malicious app using Pixnapping,” the researchers wrote on an informational website . “Chat messages, 2FA codes, email messages, etc. are all vulnerable since they are visible. If an app has secret information that is not visible (e.g., it has a secret key that is stored but never shown on the screen), that information cannot be stolen by Pixnapping.” The new attack class is reminiscent of GPU.zip , a 2023 attack that allowed malicious websites to read the usernames, passwords, and other sensitive visual data displayed by other websites. It worked by exploiting side channels found in GPUs from all major suppliers. The vulnerabilities that GPU.zip exploited have never been fixed. Instead, the attack was blocked in browsers by limiting their ability to open iframes, an HTML element that allows one website (in the case of GPU.zip, a malicious one) to embed the contents of a site from a different domain. Pixnapping targets the same side channel as GPU.zip, specifically the precise amount of time it takes for a given frame to be rendered on the screen. “This allows a malicious app to steal sensitive information displayed by other apps or arbitrary websites, pixel by pixel,” Alan Linghao Wang, lead author of the research paper “ Pixnapping: Bringing Pixel Stealing out of the Stone Age ,” explained in an interview. “Conceptually, it is as if the malicious app was taking a screenshot of screen contents it should not have access to. Our end-to-end attacks simply measure the rendering time per frame of the graphical operations to determine whether the pixel was white or nonwhite.” Pixnapping in 3 Steps The attack occurs in three main steps. In the first, the malicious app invokes Android APIs that make calls to the app the attacker wants to snoop on. These calls can also be used to effectively scan an infected device for installed apps of interest. The calls can further cause the targeted app to display specific data it has access to, such as a message thread in a messaging app or a 2FA code for a specific site. This call causes the information to be sent to the Android rendering pipeline, the system that takes each app's pixels so they can be rendered on the screen. The Android-specific calls made include activities , intents , and tasks . In the second step, Pixnapping performs graphical operations on individual pixels that the targeted app sent to the rendering pipeline.

Many Say They’re Not Involved,"israel, architecture, palestine, war, politics, donald trump, ikea, tesla","A sweeping plan to reconstruct Gaza, which has been shared with Trump administration officials, features the names and logos of more than two dozen companies—some of which tell WIRED they had no knowledge they were named or involved. The presentation outlining the plan was reportedly created by some of the businessmen who helped ideate what became the controversial nonprofit the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, which is currently leading aid distribution in Gaza, calling for the creation of a new entity called the Gaza Reconstitution, Economic Acceleration and Transformation (GREAT) Trust. In the presentation, logos from Tesla, Amazon Web Services, and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) appear alongside bullet points about the benefit ""private industry investment” may have in Gaza in terms of building out ""key infrastructure"" like data centers and ""gigafactories."" On one slide, the logos of several companies, including Ikea, appear alongside descriptions of large-scale ""infrastructure rebuild"" and ""peacekeeping (optional)"" in Gaza. WIRED contacted the 28 companies shown alongside proposals for construction, security, and private-sector investment in postwar Gaza—sectors that would be among the first to mobilize if the plans were to be set in motion. Of the companies that responded, zero said they were aware of their names and logos being used in this proposal. Eight of those companies replied to WIRED and said that they had not been in contact with anyone who developed the presentation or made even informal plans or agreements with them. Some had absolutely no knowledge they were named in this plan. “This was surprising and new information for us,” Ikea spokesperson Arvid Stigland tells WIRED. “We have not approved the use of the Ikea logo in this context.” “TSMC is not associated with this proposal and did not consent to the use of its logo,” a company spokesperson told WIRED. InterContinental Hotels Group spokesperson Mike Ward tells WIRED that the company “has had no involvement in this document and is not pursuing any plans connected to it.” Tesla, Amazon, and Constellis did not respond to requests for comment. Of the security contractors mentioned in the presentation, only G4S responded to WIRED’s query. It denied any association with any current or future group called “the GREAT Trust.” “We have had no communications thus far and have no plans to participate in security services in Gaza,” a G4S spokesperson tells WIRED. A person with knowledge of the presentation, who requested anonymity in order to speak freely, said that it was created as a form of market research, demonstrating which companies could contribute to redevelopment rather than which ones had discussed or agreed to anything.",https://www.wired.com/story/a-plan-to-rebuild-gaza-lists-nearly-30-companies-many-say-theyre-not-involved,Technology,wired.com,Caroline Haskins,"https://media.wired.com/photos/68ed4634d9a0d6c1df85c0c8/191:100/w_1280,c_limit/biz-gaza-rebuild-2235033539.jpg",2025-10-14T20:13:09.074000+00:00,84a0dc5b5152e75f644cf8d8c79ef19bba9d91dc
803c299e78b3,Interstellar Comet 3I/ATLAS Is Spewing Water Like a Cosmic Fire Hydrant,"science, comet, space, nasa, telescope","Comet 3I/Atlas continues to be full of surprises. As well as being only the third interstellar object ever detected, new analysis shows it is producing hydroxyl (OH) emissions, with these compounds betraying the presence of water on its surface. This discovery was made by a team of researchers at Auburn University in Alabama using NASA’s Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory, and was described in a study published in The Astrophysical Journal Letters . Hydroxyl compounds are detectable via the ultraviolet signature they produce. But on Earth, a lot of UV wavelengths are blocked by the atmosphere, which is why the researchers had to use the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory—a space telescope free from interference experienced by observatories on Earth. Water is present in virtually every comet seen in the solar system, so much so that the chemical and physical reactions of water are used to measure, catalog, and track these celestial objects and how they react to the heat of the sun. Finding it on 3I/ATLAS means being able to study its characteristics using the same scale used for regular comets, and this information could in future be useful data for studying the processes of comets that originate in other star systems as well. “When we detect water—or even its faint ultraviolet echo, OH—from an interstellar comet, we’re reading a note from another planetary system,” said Dennis Bodewits, an Auburn University physicist who collaborated on the research, in a press statement . “It tells us that the ingredients for life’s chemistry are not unique to our own.” Comets are frozen hunks of rock, gases, and dust that usually orbit stars (the exceptions being the three interstellar objects found so far). When they’re far away from a star, they’re completely frozen, but as they get closer, solar radiation causes their frozen elements to heat up and sublimate—turn from solid into gas—with some of this material emitted from the comet’s nucleus thanks to the star’s energy, forming a “tail.” But with 3I/ATLAS, data collected revealed an unexpected detail: OH production by the comet was already happening far away from the sun—when the comet was more than three times farther from the sun than the Earth—in a region of the solar system where temperatures normally aren’t sufficient to easily produce the sublimation of ice. Already at that distance, however, 3I/ATLAS was leaking water at the rate of about 40 kilograms per second, a flow comparable—the study authors explain—to that of a “hydrant at maximum power.” This detail would seem to indicate a more complex structure than what is usually observed in comets in the solar system. It could, for example, be explained by the presence of small fragments of ice detaching from the comet’s nucleus, and which are then vaporized by the heat of sunlight, going on to feed a gaseous cloud that surrounds the celestial body. This is something that has so far been observed only in a small number of extremely distant comets, and which could provide valuable information about the processes from which 3I/ATLAS originated. “Every interstellar comet so far has been a surprise,” said Zexi Xing, an Auburn University researcher and coauthor of the discovery, in a press statement . “‘Oumuamua was dry, Borisov was rich in carbon monoxide, and now ATLAS is giving up water at a distance where we didn’t expect it. Each one is rewriting what we thought we knew about how planets and comets form around stars.” This story originally appeared on WIRED Italia and has been translated from Italian.",https://www.wired.com/story/interstellar-comet-3i-atlas-is-spewing-water-like-a-cosmic-fire-hydrant,Technology,wired.com,Simone Valesini,"https://media.wired.com/photos/68ee73725e8cd475a202eac2/191:100/w_1280,c_limit/SPHERExImage1-ezgif.com-crop.jpg",2025-10-14T19:03:23.943000+00:00,f899c3c31cf0cbd23500ea96485d0fa21ad38e01
aabb687ba639,The 50 Best Shows on Hulu Right Now,"culture guides, hulu, tv","While Netflix seemingly led the way for other streaming networks to create compelling original programming, Hulu actually beat them all to the punch. In 2011, a year before Netflix ’s Lilyhammer and two years before the arrival of House of Cards , the burgeoning streamer premiered The Morning After , a pop-culture-focused news show that ran for 800 episodes over three years. Hulu has continued to make TV history in the years since, most notably in 2017 when it became the first streamer to win an Emmy Award for Outstanding Drama Series with The Handmaid’s Tale (which recently dropped its long-awaited final season). In the years since, the streamer has continued to match—and often exceed—that high bar for quality entertainment with shows Shōgun , which set an Emmy record in 2024 with 18 wins in a single season, and The Bear . While more competition has popped up since Hulu started gaining critical credibility, the network has continued to stand out for its carefully curated selection of original series and network partnerships that make it the home of FX series and more. Below are some of our favorite shows streaming on Hulu right now. Not finding what you’re looking for?

Murdaugh: Death in the Family In February 2019, Lowcountry lawyer Alex Murdaugh brought his prominent South Carolina family’s name into spotlight when his 19-year-old son Paul, after a long night of partying, crashed the family’s boat into a bridge with five other people aboard. One of the teens—19-year-old Mallory Beach—was thrown from the vessel and did not survive. It was just the beginning of a bizarre, yearslong series of tragedies that struck the family, resulting in multiple arrests, murders, and ultimately two life sentences for Alex Murdaugh. Jason Clarke ( Zero Dark Thirty ) and Patricia Arquette ( Severance ) take on the role of Alex and Maggie Murdaugh in this dramatic retelling of the crimes that have rocked a nation. Abbott Elementary Quinta Brunson created and stars in this hit series, which follows the daily lives—in and out of the classroom—of a group of teachers at what is widely considered one of the worst public schools in America. Despite a lack of funding for even basic educational necessities and school district leaders who care only about the barest minimum standards, these educators are united by their drive to surpass expectations and encourage their students to do the same. The series has been a huge hit for ABC, which premieres its new episodes on Wednesdays, which then arrive on Hulu the following day. The show’s fifth season kicked off on October 1. Solar Opposites This animated sci-fi comedy, which premiered in 2020, is about a family of aliens from the planet Shlorp who crash-land on Earth—for better or worse. The show is rooted in the idea that humans are, well, weird. Which seems appropriate given this moment in time. Yet, in between the laughs and occasional threat to humanity, it maintains a positive outlook on the world and the people who inhabit it, which is something we could probably all use right about now. So it’s a good thing the show’s highly anticipated sixth season just arrived on October 13. The bad news, however, is that this season will be its last. Only Murders in the Building Steve Martin, Martin Short, and Selena Gomez make for a delightful trio of true-crime-obsessed podcast fans who, in season 1 of this original Hulu series, decide to join forces and create their own podcast while attempting to solve the mysterious death of a fellow resident of their Manhattan apartment building. From the very beginning of their odd alliance, it’s been clear that all is not what it seems, and everyone is keeping secrets. The show has also managed to attract an increasingly stellar list of guest stars, some of them recurring characters, that includes Meryl Streep, Paul Rudd, Eugene Levy, Kumail Nanjiani, Tina Fey, Melissa McCarthy, Zach Galifianakis, Sting, Nathan Lane, and Jane Lynch. Season 5, which contains some fun nods to The Godfather , kicked off on September 9 and features Bobby Cannavale, Renée Zellweger, Christoph Waltz, Keegan-Michael Key, Téa Leoni, Logan Lerman, Beanie Feldstein, Dianne Wiest, and Richard Kind. Tempest This action-filled spy drama from South Korea is a thrilling—and timely—tale of global corruption at the highest levels. Jang Jun-ik (Park Hae-joon) is a presidential candidate who dreams of bringing peace to his people—a notion that doesn’t sit well with everyone. When he is assassinated just feet from his wife, Seo Mun-ju (Jun Ji-hyun), a former ambassador, she vows to get to the truth behind her husband’s murder. What she discovers is a chilling conspiracy that threatens world peace and leads all the way to the White House. Good thing she’s got mercenary Baek San-ho (Gang Dong-won) by her side. The Twisted Tale of Amanda Knox In September 2007, Amanda Knox was just another American college student opting to study abroad for a year. Just weeks later, she was on the front page of newspapers around the world following the brutal murder of her roommate, Meredith Kercher, which Knox was eventually arrested for. Nearly 20 years—and one controversial murder conviction—later, Knox is reclaiming her own narrative to tell her version of events in this new Hulu series, which is based on Knox’s own memoir and executive produced by Knox and Monica Lewinsky. Though the series’ campiness doesn’t always land given the subject matter, star Grace Van Patten’s impressive performance helps to ground the story. Alien: Earth With Fargo , Noah Hawley proved that he could transform an iconic movie into a compelling TV series. Now he’s done it again with Alien: Earth , a prequel series that takes place just two years before the events of Ridley Scott’s original Alien movie . The series revolves around the Prodigy Corporation, a tech company that has come up with a way to transfer the consciousness of terminally ill children into the bodies of synthetic beings. Wendy (Sydney Chandler) is one of these “hybrids,” whose memory of her past turns out to be a complication, especially when she volunteers herself and her fellow hybrids to investigate the mysterious crash of a Weyland-Yutani research spacecraft, which houses all sorts of horrors—and creatures. King of the Hill Fifteen years after saying goodbye, Mike Judge and Greg Daniels’ beloved animated series is taking viewers back to Arlen, Texas, home of propane salesman Hank Hill (Judge), his wife Peggy (Kathy Najimy), and their son Bobby (Pamela Adlon). Hank and Peggy have been away for a while, living in Saudi Arabia while Hank saves for their retirement. But their return home is bittersweet, for as much as Arlen has remained the same, the world around them has changed. Dope Girls Though it’s not based on a true story, Dope Girls is inspired by a nonfiction book, Marek Cohen’s Dope Girls: The Birth of the British Drug Underground , and a very real part of British history. In the wake of World War I, Kate Galloway (Julianne Nicholson) is a widow and mom who needs to provide for her family. She ends up building one of London’s most popular underground nightclubs, and a drug empire that would make Walter White blush. Washington Black Esi Edugyan’s 2018 best-selling historical fiction novel gets the miniseries treatment via Hulu. Eleven-year-old George Washington “Wash” Black (Ernest Kingsley Jr.) flees from his native Barbados to Nova Scotia following a tragic incident at the plantation where he was enslaved. Once free, Wash meets Medwin Harris (Sterling K. Brown), who is impressed with Wash’s intelligence and determination, and sees a lot of himself in the youngster. So he takes him under his wing in order to help him make the most of the second chance at life he has been given. The Bear Carmen “Carmy” Berzatto (Jeremy Allen White) is a superstar of the fine-dining world who has returned to his hometown of Chicago to save his family’s failing sandwich shop after his brother’s death by suicide. While Carmy initially struggles to acclimate himself to being home and to his inherited kitchen’s back-to-basics style, he eventually realizes that it’s not too late to change both himself and the restaurant. Anyone who has ever worked in a busy kitchen knows the stress that comes with it, and The Bear does an excellent job of making that tension palpable. While the plot sounds simple enough, much of Carmy’s previous life is a bit of a mystery, and it’s doled out in amuse-bouche-sized bits throughout the series with top-tier guest stars you may not have seen coming. (Fact: Jamie Lee Curtis has never been better, as evidenced by her very first Emmy win in 2024.) The Bear ’s fourth season answers viewers’ pressing questions about Carmy’s partnership with Syd (Ayo Edebiri) and what the future holds for their restaurant. Prepare to feast. Such Brave Girls Comedian/actress Kat Sadler created and stars in this deeply messy, darkly funny story of a totally dysfunctional family—mom Deb ( Sherlock ’s Louise Brealey) and daughters Josie (Sadler) and Billie (Lizzie Davidson, Sadler’s real-life sister)—attempting to pick up the pieces after their husband/father leaves them. It’s cringe-comedy at its finest, and the kind that will appeal to fans of Fleabag . The series’ second season arrived in July. Adults Though many have dubbed Adults a Gen Z version of Friends , the similarities begin and end with the fact that it’s about a group of twentysomething pals trying to find themselves in New York City. When Samir’s (Malik Elassal) parents take off traveling, he invites a few of his pals—Anton (Owen Thiele), Billie (Lucy Freyer), and Issa (Amita Rao)—to come crash with him at his childhood home in Queens. While they all see it as a chance to supercharge their jump into adulthood, complete with hosting dinner parties, they soon realize they’re each in over their heads in their own ways when it comes to taking on the responsibilities that come with being a part of the real world. Welcome to Wrexham In 2020, actor pals Ryan Reynolds and Rob McElhenney (now legally known simply as “Rob Mac”) decided to take their friendship to the next level—by purchasing Wales’ Wrexham AFC, one of the world’s oldest football (aka soccer) clubs, which had long been struggling and was on the verge of possibly disappearing altogether. Enter the two Hollywood stars and their dreams of bringing the club back to its former glory. Like a real-life Ted Lasso , this docuseries follows the two as they begin to understand that what might have started as a lark is a literally game-changing turn for the players and people of Wrexham in reclaiming their storied sporting history. All four seasons of the series are streaming, with a fifth in the works. The Handmaid’s Tale When Margaret Atwood wrote The Handmaid’s Tale in 1985, little did she know that its television adaptation would revolutionize the still-nascent world of original streaming content. And she may not have anticipated just how many parallels her dystopian classic would share with the real world at the time it was adapted into an award-winning television series. It’s set in an unnamed time in what is presumably the very near future, when the United States has been taken over by a fundamentalist group known as Gilead, under whose regime women are considered property and stripped of any personal rights. The most valuable women are those who are fertile, as infertility has become an epidemic, and they are kept as handmaids who are forced to take part in sexual rituals with high-ranking couples in order to bear their children. Recognizing the power she wields, Offred, aka June Osborne (Elisabeth Moss), is not content to remain enslaved and sets about changing the rules as she seeks to reunite with her lost husband and daughter, becoming romantically entangled with a Gilead Guardian (Max Minghella) in the process. The Handmaid’s Tale's sixth, and final, season is streaming in full now. Dying for Sex Five-time Oscar nominee Michelle Williams plays Molly Kochan, a young woman trapped in a loveless marriage who learns that she has terminal stage IV breast cancer. After revealing that she has never had an orgasm with another person, it becomes apparent to Molly and everyone caring for her that this should be at the top of her bucket list. Realizing she doesn’t have much time left, Molly leaves her husband and, with the help of her best friend Nikki (Jenny Slate), sets out to achieve the sexual satisfaction that has eluded her all her life—with unexpected consequences. New Girl creator ​​Liz Meriwether teamed up with Kim Rosenstock ( Only Murders in the Building ) to create this hit new series, which is based on the life of the real Molly Kochan, creator of the Dying for Sex podcast, which launched in 2020. It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia If you thought the characters on Seinfeld were terrible people, wait until you meet the gang from Paddy’s Pub. For 20 years, Dennis (Glenn Howerton), Mac (Robert “Rob Mac” McElhenney), Charlie (Charlie Day), Sweet Dee (Kaitlin Olson), and Frank (Danny DeVito) have unapologetically plotted against each other and total strangers in a series of completely self-centered schemes with absolutely no regard for the rules of civility. The show follows the “ no hugging and no learning ” rule Larry David established for Seinfeld , but elevates it to a new level of sociopathy. “Dennis and Dee Go on Welfare,” “Sweet Dee Has a Heart Attack,” “How Mac Got Fat,” “Dennis Looks Like a Registered Sex Offender,” “The Gang Turns Black,” and “The Gang Goes to a Water Park” are just some of the offbeat adventures awaiting viewers. In 2021, Sunny became the longest-running live-action sitcom in the history of television, and it shows no signs of slowing down—or taking it easy on its characters. It also happens to be one of the easiest shows to binge: Pop an episode on and, without even realizing it, you’ll be on to another season. Its 17th (!!) season wrapped in August with at least one more already confirmed. Big Boys Creator Jack Rooke won a well-deserved BAFTA Award in 2024 for this semi-autobiographical dramedy about a closeted 19-year-old—also named Jack (Dylan Llewellyn)—who, after a year of mourning the death of his father at home with his overprotective mom, leaves for university. There, he’s paired up with Danny (Jon Pointing), a 25-year-old more interested in meeting women than studying, as his roommate. As Jack struggles to become comfortable with his sexuality, he also comes to understand the truth behind Danny’s seemingly extroverted personality. Yes, it’s a coming-of-age story and one in which opposites attract (on a purely platonic level). But it’s also a laugh-out-loud funny series that shows there is life after death. Deli Boys Pakistani American brothers Mir (Asif Ali) and Raj (Saagar Shaikh) Dar have spent their entire lives wanting for nothing, thanks to the hard work of their father, who owns a chain of convenience stores. But after a freak accident kills dear old dad, the brothers are expected to take on the family business which, unbeknownst to them, is actually a front for a drug smuggling empire. While their antics are undoubtedly hilarious, the series does attempt to paint a truthful portrait of the immigrant experience—even if it’s often through an absurdist lens. In late August, almost six months after the series premiered, Hulu finally confirmed that a second season is on its way, with former SNL star Fred Armisen joining the cast. A Thousand Blows If Netflix’s Emmy juggernaut Adolescence has you seeking out more of Stephen Graham’s work, check out Steven Knight’s A Thousand Blows —the Peaky Blinders creator’s newest British historical drama in which crime and violence collide. In this case it’s an all-female crime syndicate, the Forty Elephants, who are at the center of the action, with Mary Carr (Erin Doherty) as their leader. When Mary’s crew crosses notorious kingpin Sugar Goodson (Graham), she turns to Hezekiah Moscow (Malachi Kirby) and Alec Munroe (Francis Lovehall), two young men who have recently emigrated from Jamaica in order to make a better life for themselves, to help her escape Goodson’s wrath. Paradise This Is Us creator Dan Fogelman reteams with that award-winning series’ star, Sterling K. Brown, for an intricate political thriller which plays with time to slowly reveal the details of a secret service agent (Brown) tasked with protecting the president (James Marsden) who ultimately becomes a suspect in the POTUS’ death. Expect many twists—including a massive one to kick off the series in episode 1. A second season is already in the works and will add Shailene Woodley, Thomas Doherty, Michael McGrady, and Timothy Omundson to the cast. It is expected to premiere in early 2026. Scamanda “Why would somebody fake cancer?” That’s the question asked—and that ABC News attempts to answer—in this true crime docuseries based on the podcast of the same name. The four-part special recounts the life and lies of Amanda C. Riley, a wife, mother, churchgoer, and popular mommy blogger who was celebrated for sharing her fight against Hodgkin’s lymphoma with the world … only to have it all blow up in her face. Accused Like a reverse engineered version of Law & Order , Accused —adapted by Homeland cocreator Howard Gordon from the acclaimed British series of the same name—follows the justice system from the perspective of the accused. Each episode begins with the defendant in the courtroom and recounts (via flashbacks) the circumstances that led them there. Like Dick Wolf’s iconic crime series, each episode is full of familiar faces, from Whitney Cummings and Wendell Pierce to Molly Parker and Margo Martindale. Say Nothing Fact and fiction combine in this historical drama based on Patrick Radden Keefe’s novel that follows the lives of a group of people growing up in Belfast during the Troubles and their dealings with the Provisional IRA. Much of the story focuses on the Disappeared—a group of 16 people who went missing during the Troubles and were believed to have been kidnapped and murdered. Jean McConville was one of these individuals, both the only woman among them and the only Irish Catholic convert. Nearly 50 years later, many questions remain about these individuals. While Say Nothing doesn’t attempt to answer all of these questions, it does add fascinating context to the events. Interior Chinatown Willis Wu (Jimmy O. Yang) is a waiter who attempts to escape his humdrum life by imagining that he is a background actor in a Law & Order -esque TV show called Black & White . After Wu witnesses a kidnapping, police detective Lana Lee (Chloe Bennet) enlists him to help investigate and take down the local gangs in Chinatown—where he discovers something about his own family in the process. Nothing is what it seems in this meta comedy-crime series, which Charles Yu adapted from his own National Book Award–winning novel. The Daily Show ’s Ronny Chieng ups the comedy as Wu’s coworker/BFF Fatty Choi, and Taika Waititi (one of the show’s executive producers) directs the pilot. What We Do in the Shadows If you are in need of a laugh-out-loud comedy (and don’t mind if it’s of the sometimes R-rated kind), there are few better than What We Do in the Shadows . In 2014, Jemaine Clement and Taika Waititi cowrote, codirected, and costarred in a feature of the same name—a funny mockumentary featuring a group of vampires who share a home. This series, which premiered in 2019, moved the vampire action from New Zealand to Staten Island and brought in a whole new group of vampires—who struggle to even get up off the couch, let alone take over all of New York City (as they’ve been instructed to). After several years, they finally seem ready to get around to the task. All six seasons of the series, which wrapped up its run in late 2024, are available for streaming. La Máquina Gael García Bernal and Diego Luna have been close friends since childhood, and it shows in the work they’ve done together—most famously in Alfonso Cuarón’s Oscar-nominated Y Tu Mamá También (2001). More than two decades later, their onscreen chemistry is still potent, as evidenced by this Spanish-language boxing drama. Esteban (Bernal) is an aging boxer whose manager/BFF Andy (Luna) persuades him to step into the ring one last time before he officially retires. But as the match looms closer, the criminal underbelly of the sport rears its head—forcing Esteban to determine what parts of his life he’s willing to sacrifice. With just six episodes in all, La Máquina moves fast. Don’t flinch. How to Die Alone Former Saturday Night Live and Insecure writer Natasha Rothwell—whom you might know from her Emmy-nominated turn as spa manager Belinda in seasons 1 and 3 of The White Lotus —created and stars in this eight-episode series. Mel (Rothwell) is an employee at New York City’s JFK Airport who is content with the uneventful life she has built for herself. But when she has a sudden brush with death, she decides to take her life into her own hands. While it’s not the first series to explore matters of life and death, it does so in a way that is both beautifully nuanced and laugh-out-loud funny—all of it anchored by Rothwell’s performance. On February 4, Hulu announced that it had canceled the series after one season—a move that has Rothwell “baffled” and looking for a new network to produce season 2. English Teacher Television audiences are hardly lacking in high school–set comedies, or in really great high school–set comedies, and/or really great high school–set comedies that focus on the teacher perspective (see: Abbott Elementary ). English Teacher fits into that elite niche. Brian Jordan Alvarez—who was behind the award-winning 2016 web series The Gay and Wondrous Life of Caleb Gallo —both created and stars in the show, in which he portrays an English teacher in Austin, Texas, who is dedicated to making an impact on his students, even if he sometimes needs to depend on their teenage wisdom to figure out the right way to do that. While it doesn’t shy away from the politics that exist in the teaching profession, the series also presents the “adults” as often just as lost as the kids they teach. English Teacher ’s second season launched in September. Futurama Following a decade-long hiatus, Futurama —Matt Groening and David X. Cohen’s animated sci-fi comedy—made a triumphant return in 2023, complete with gags about Twilight Zone and “Momazon” drone deliveries. The show’s all-new 13th season arrived on September 15, with all 10 episodes dropping at once versus weekly, as has been the case in the past. And one more season has already been confirmed, making now the perfect time to dive back in—or watch it all for the first time. We Were the Lucky Ones In Radom, Poland, the Kurcs are a loving family who seem to have it all—until the horrors of the Holocaust invade the serenity of their everyday lives. As World War II arrives on their doorstep, the family is separated—escaping to France, Brazil, West Africa, and Russia. Some are in hiding, others in concentration camps. But they’re all focused on one goal: surviving the war and reuniting with each other. Queenie Queenie Jenkins (Dionne Brown) is a Jamaican-British twentysomething whose world is thrown into an upheaval following an ugly breakup with her boyfriend. That messiness follows Queenie into the next chapter in her life, when she attempts to pick up the pieces of her failed relationship while frequently butting heads with her family and trying to reconcile her dual cultures. Candice Carty-Williams adapts her own bestselling novel to create a poignant dramedy that’s ultimately about trauma and healing. Black Twitter: A People’s History In the late 2000s—back when Elon Musk was just that car-and-spaceship billionaire—Twitter was more than a social media network. It was a genuine gathering place for people to find their people, whether that was Film Twitter or Cat Twitter. For Black Twitter, it was a lot more. This three-part docuseries, based on WIRED senior writer Jason Parham’s 2021 cover story , recounts the most important moments and movements that helped solidify the Black Twitter community’s place as a cultural force in the world, from politics and beyond. Under the Bridge Riley Keough and Lily Gladstone (who earned an Emmy nomination for her work in the show) make a formidable duo as an author and a police officer, respectively, investigating the brutal murder of a 14-year-old girl in a small town in Canada. The limited series is based on Rebecca Godfrey’s award-winning 2005 book of the same name (with Keough portraying Godfrey), and is a haunting reminder of what human beings are capable of. Shōgun Game of Thrones fans still lamenting the loss of one of television's great epics have found their new favorite binge-watch in Shōgun, which took home a record 18 Emmys (with 25 nods altogether) in 2024. This 10-episode series, based on James Clavell’s beloved novel (which was first adapted into a miniseries in 1980), is a brilliant and sweeping tale of political rivalry in feudal Japan where Lord Yoshii Toranaga (Hiroyuki Sanada), a powerful warrior, has a target put on his back by his political rivals in the Council of Regents. Fortunately for Toranaga, he’s got Toda Mariko (Anna Sawai), a talented translator and fiercely loyal samurai, by his side. Shōgun was originally positioned as a one-and-done limited series, but FX and Hulu have already confirmed that two more seasons are in the works, with the next expected to arrive in 2027. Fargo Noah Hawley’s anthology series isn’t the first attempt to adapt the Coen brothers’ Oscar-winning crime-comedy to the small screen (Edie Falco starred in a previous version, which was a more straightforward adaptation of the movie), but his approach was clearly the smarter move. Fans of the Coens in general will find lots to love about the many nods to the filmmakers’ entire filmography, with each season covering a different crime and time period. Though the seasons do share connections, each one is a total one-off, and the show might boast the most talented group of actors ever assembled: Billy Bob Thornton, Martin Freeman, Bob Odenkirk, Oliver Platt, Ted Danson, Patrick Wilson, Nick Offerman, Kirsten Dunst, Jesse Plemons, Ewan McGregor, Michael Stuhlbarg, Carrie Coon, Scoot McNairy, Chris Rock, Jason Schwartzman, Timothy Olyphant, and Ben Whishaw are just a few of the names who’ve found a home in Fargo . The fantastic fifth season—featuring Juno Temple, Jon Hamm, Jennifer Jason Leigh, Joe Keery, and Lamorne Morris (who won an Emmy for his role)—continued this tradition of exceptional acting, with all episodes streaming now. A Murder at the End of the World Darby Hart (Emma Corrin) is a talented hacker and armchair detective who is one of eight guests invited to spend a few days at the stunning yet remote home of a mysterious billionaire (Clive Owen). When one of the guests ends up dead, Darby must work quickly to prove that it was murder—and who did it—before the bodies start piling up. Fans of twisty true crime will appreciate this limited series, which comes from the minds of Brit Marling (who costars) and Zal Batmanglij— cocreators of the equally mind-bending The OA . The Other Black Girl Sinclair Daniel shines as Nella Rogers, an up-and-coming book editor—and the only Black employee at the publishing house where she works. While Nella is initially thrilled when another young woman of color, Hazel-May McCall (Ashleigh Murray), is hired as an assistant, she can’t help but notice that a series of bizarre events seems to follow. As Nella tries to suss out exactly what is going on, she uncovers some pretty damn disturbing skeletons in her employer’s closet. While horror-comedies are an increasingly popular movie genre, we don’t see them on the small screen quite as often—which, if this clever series is any indication, is a real shame. Also unfortunate: One season is all we’ll get of The Other Black Girl. The Full Monty Twenty-six years after a low-budget British comedy blew up at the box office, scored an Oscar, and introduced “the Full Monty” into the popular lexicon, the Regular Joes turned strippers from Sheffield are back to face largely the same issues they were lamenting in the original feature film (which is also streaming on Hulu ). Much of the main cast reassembled for this follow-up to Peter Cattaneo’s hit 1997 movie, including two-time Oscar nominee Tom Wilkinson, who passed away in late December. Stripping is involved, as are other inevitables in life, including breakups, reconciliations, and death. For fans of the original movie—or the Broadway musical and stage play that followed—it’s a fun check-in with the characters who bared it all. The Office (UK) Years before there was Jim and Pam and Dwight and Michael, there were Tim and Dawn and Gareth and David. For lovers of cringe, it’s hard to do better than Ricky Gervais and Stephen Merchant’s workplace comedy. David Brent (Gervais) is the original boss from hell, whose office antics will have you covering your eyes and laughing out loud at the same time. Like many British series, there are just two seasons—each consisting of a mere six episodes—plus a two-part Christmas special. Don’t be surprised if you sit down to watch a single episode and binge it all in one go. Dopesick Back in 2021, Hulu went where Netflix’s Painkiller went in 2023: to the late ’90s and early 2000s, aka the beginning of America’s opioid crisis. Danny Strong created this retelling of the lengths to which Richard Sackler (played here by the always excellent Michael Stuhlbarg) and Purdue Pharma would go to sell doctors on the powers of OxyContin—all with the promise of no addiction. Michael Keaton won an Emmy for his portrayal of a widowed doctor in Appalachia who buys into the lies, and eventually becomes a victim of them. Reservation Dogs Taika Waititi and Sterlin Harjo cocreated this Peabody Award–winning series, which made history as the first mainstream TV show created by, starring, and crewed by an almost entirely Indigenous American team. It tells the story of four bored teens who are desperate to escape their lives on a reservation in Oklahoma. They decide that California is where they want to be and commit to a life of mostly petty crimes in order to save up enough money to leave. The full three seasons are available to watch now, including the brilliant series sendoff. The Great Elle Fanning and Nicholas Hoult shine in this witty, fast-paced, comedic retelling (but not really) of Catherine the Great’s rise to power. Created by Tony McNamara, who earned Oscar nominations for his writing work on both The Favourite and Poor Things , The Great offers the same combination of lush costumes and scenery mixed with a biting commentary on the world, and a woman’s place in it. A story that rings as true today as it did in the 18th century, when Catherine the Great became empress of Russia and brought about the Age of Enlightenment, this show chips away at notions of class, propriety, and monarchical rule in a way few others do. If it’s historical accuracy you’re after, look elsewhere; the series’ creators describe it as decidedly “anti-historical” (which is part of the fun). All three seasons are available to stream. Tiny Beautiful Things The reason to watch this eight-part limited series can be summed up in two words: Kathryn Hahn. A comedic juggernaut , Hahn can switch from funny to dramatic in the same scene, if not the same sentence. This talent is on display in Tiny Beautiful Things , where she plays Claire, a writer who takes up an advice column and pours all the traumas of her life into responding to her readers. Based on Wild author Cheryl Strayed’s collection of “Dear Sugar” columns, the vignettes here may be a bit out of sorts, but Hahn pulls them together. Dave Dave Burd is a comedian and rapper who goes by the stage name Lil Dicky. In Dave , Burd plays a rapper who goes by the stage name Lil Dicky and is attempting to raise his profile and make a much bigger name for himself. If only his many neuroses didn’t keep getting in the way. While Dave could have easily turned into some mediocre experiment in meta storytelling, Burd—who cocreated the series, stars in it, and has written several episodes—grapples with some surprisingly touchy topics, including mental illness. And he does it all with a level of sensitivity and honesty that you might not expect from a guy named Lil Dicky. Despite the show’s popularity and critical acclaim, the three seasons currently streaming may be all we get of Dave . In early 2024, Burd announced that he’d be pressing “pause” on the series in order to explore other creative ventures. (But never say never.) Atlanta Donald Glover proved himself to be a quadruple threat of an actor, writer, musician, and comedian with this highly acclaimed FX series about Earnest “Earn” Marks (Glover), an aspiring music manager who is trying to help his cousin Alfred Miles, aka Paper Boi (Brian Tyree Henry), kick off his musical career. They’re surrounded by a supportive crew of friends, including Alfred’s BFF, Darius (LaKeith Stanfield), and Van (Zazie Beetz), Earn’s close friend and the mother of his child. This makes it all sound like a fairly straightforward buddy comedy, but Atlanta is so much more. Even better: It’s weird. Glover is not afraid to experiment with storytelling, which is part of what makes the show so compelling. Baskets Zach Galifianakis stars alongside Zach Galifianakis as twin brothers Chip and Dale Baskets in this unexpectedly moving family comedy about an aspiring clown (Chip) who fails to graduate from a fancy clowning school in Paris and is forced to return home to Bakersfield, California, where he lives with his mother (the late Louie Anderson) and is constantly belittled by his higher-achieving brother (Dale). Between the dual role for Galifianakis and Anderson as the mom, it may sound like a cheap bit of stunt casting that can’t sustain more than an episode, let alone multiple character arcs. But if you’re a fan of absurdist comedy, Baskets truly ranks among the best of them. And Anderson, who won his first and only Emmy for his role as Costco-loving Christine, is absolutely transcendent. While it received a fair amount of critical acclaim, Baskets could rightly be considered one of the most underseen and underappreciated series in recent memory. The Dropout Amanda Seyfried won a much deserved Outstanding Lead Actress Emmy for her portrayal of the notorious Stanford dropout turned health care technology maven Elizabeth Holmes, who tricked some of the world’s savviest business minds into investing in her company, Theranos. While Holmes’ goal was altruistic enough—making health care more accessible to the masses via a device that could detect any number of diseases with little more than a single finger prick of blood—the technology wasn’t able to catch up. Rather than admit defeat, she kept pushing, making business deals and promises she could never fulfill. Letterkenny What began as a web series is now a Hulu original that wrapped up its eleventh season in December. The show is a portrait of small-town Canada (the fictional Letterkenny of the title) and focuses on siblings Wayne (cocreator Jared Keeso) and Katy (Michelle Mylett), who run a produce stand with help from friends Daryl (Nathan Dales) and Squirrely Dan (K. Trevor Wilson). As is often the case in small-town series, many of the residents fall into specific categories—in Letterkenny , you could be a gym rat, a hick, a skid (their word for a drug addict), or a “native” (a member of the nearby First Nation reservation). But in contrast to many small-town series, these groups—and the individuals who comprise them—aren’t reduced to meaningless stereotypes. Pen15 Mining the awkwardness of one’s middle school years is hardly a new comedy concept. But being in your early thirties and playing yourself as a junior high school student and then surrounding yourself with age-appropriate actors who are actually going through that hellish rite of passage brings a whole new layer of cringe and humor. This is exactly what cocreators/stars Maya Erskine and Anna Konkle did for Pen15.",https://www.wired.com/story/best-tv-shows-hulu-this-week,Technology,wired.com,Jennifer M.

827ced5e7e68,Do You Really Have to Stop Using Windows 10?,"windows, how-to, operating systems, microsoft, software","The end is here—at least, it is for Windows 10. Microsoft officially stopped supporting the decade-old operating system on October 14, 2025. There's one hiccup, though: Even though Windows 11 is a free update, more people still use Windows 10 than Windows 11, according to statcounter.com , a site that tracks operating system usage worldwide. Plenty of people, it seems, either don't want to upgrade to Windows 11 or are using devices that aren't supported . This means millions of people could be using an operating system that’s no longer receiving security updates. If you're one of them, it makes sense to learn what happens to your computer now—and what you should do about it. Here's a summary of what's happening with Windows 10 and four options you have to replace it. Windows 10 Will Keep Working (But It Will Be Less Secure) Nothing in particular is going to happen after October 14. Your computer will keep working the way it has, and you're unlikely to run into issues. That doesn't mean it's a great idea to keep using Windows 10, though. That's because the system will no longer receive security updates or patches from Microsoft. This won't matter much until a new Windows exploit is discovered. After that, though, your device will have vulnerabilities that will never be patched. At that point, you will be at increased risk of attacks like ransomware, where a virus encrypts all of your files and scammers demand a payment in order to decrypt them. Continuing to use Windows 10 long-term dramatically increases the odds of these and other attacks. There are other potential annoyances. Third-party developers, meaning the companies that make the software you use and the games you play, tend to stop providing updates for operating systems that are no longer officially supported. So, if a game adds new features in an update, you might not be able to install it. The same goes for the software you rely on to do your work: Over time, the latest versions of your desktop apps won't run on Windows 10, meaning you'll miss out on features. There's also a security angle. In addition to no longer receiving security updates for your operating system, you'll also eventually stop getting security updates for the tools you use. None of this will happen right away on October 14. But you can expect to start hearing about software makers dropping support for Windows 10 later on. It's a good idea, then, to be prepared. Microsoft has two official recommendations: updating your computer to Windows 11, which is free provided your computer supports it. The other recommendation is to buy a new device, presumably one already running Windows 11 . Those aren't your only choices, though. You could replace Windows with another operating system entirely, like ChromeOS or Linux. Let's talk through all four options. Option 1: Try to Install Windows 11 The simplest thing, for most people, is to upgrade to Windows 11 . Yes, this is annoying if you prefer Windows 10, but the good news is that Windows 11 is free, and the irritating AI features are easy to turn off. Find out whether your computer supports Windows 11 by opening Settings . Head to Settings > Privacy and Security > Windows Update. If your computer is compatible you should see an Upgrade to Windows 11 option. From there, you can click it to start the update procedure. Note that it's generally a good idea to back up your computer before upgrading your operating system.",https://www.wired.com/story/do-you-really-have-to-stop-using-windows-10,Technology,wired.com,Justin Pot,"https://media.wired.com/photos/681cd21fc603f12b08e4fb28/191:100/w_1280,c_limit/windows-10-byebye-gear-1237969700.jpg",2025-05-09T11:30:00+00:00,6527400011a92046878045e564a8f6f6263cd774
25c79ec57769,A 4-Pack of Apple AirTags Is Just $65 Right Now,"shopping, deals, apple, accessories and peripherals","Picked up some fun new toys in the last few weeks that you need to keep track of? Amazon currently has Apple AirTags in a four pack marked down to just $65, an excellent price for these easy-to-use location tracking devices. While there are plenty of similar tracking tags on the market, Apple’s AirTags have some unique features that set them apart. Probably the most relevant is that they leverage Apple's entire network of devices for tracking, rather than just your phone, or other users who happen to have the company's app installed. That means they're more likely to show up as they get further away from you, and you can set them as lost in the system to notify you when they come within range of an iPhone or iPad. They're also extremely easy to set up and pair to your phone, thanks to the close pairing of Apple's hardware and iOS software. Just tap the AirTag to your phone to connect it to your account, and you're ready to go. They're compact enough that they can squeeze into basically anywhere, including on a keychain or tucked into a small purse. You can also share them with up to five family members, in case you need to help your significant other track down their keys. Apple has put a ton of work into making the AirTag super useful while also keeping an eye on safety and security concerns. Both Apple and Android phones will warn you if an AirTag not linked to your account is following you around, and they'll even beep occasionally when they aren't within range of any Apple devices on the Find My network. The biggest downside to the Apple AirTag is that it doesn't work with Android devices at all, except for the safety warning. If you aren't an iPhone owner, make sure to check out our other favorite tracking devices to keep your belongings safe . For everyone else, the AirTag is an excellent option, and for just over $15 a piece, can give you a lot of peace of mind when it comes to your most valued gadgets.",https://www.wired.com/story/apple-airtag-deal-1025,Technology,wired.com,Brad Bourque,"https://media.wired.com/photos/68ee868e5ef7aed7dd9fd328/191:100/w_1280,c_limit/Score%20a%20Four%20Pack%20of%20Apple%20AirTags%20for%20Just%20$65.png",2025-10-14T18:24:31.684000+00:00,44e6fb1e23d3096409d0e3424c158312e4622093
c852b5a6d050,Feds Seize Record-Breaking $15 Billion in Bitcoin From Alleged Scam Empire,"bitcoin, cryptocurrency, crime, blockchain, security, scams","Over the past five years, criminals behind widespread romance and investment scams—often inelegantly referred to as “ pig butchering ”—have stolen tens of billions from people around the world. Now law enforcement has carried out one of its biggest operations yet against that sprawling scam industry, targeting the operators of several modern slavery scam compounds in Southeast Asia—where, as a whole, hundreds of thousands of human trafficking victims have been forced to run the fraud operations on behalf of criminal gangs. On Tuesday, officials in the United States and United Kingdom took coordinated action against one giant Cambodian organization and its boss who has allegedly run a series of notorious scam centers in the country. The US Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) announced it has issued financial sanctions against 146 “targets” linked to the newly designated Prince Group Transnational Criminal Organization. This action includes targeting individuals and shell companies linked to the alleged criminal enterprise. As part of the sweeping action also involving the FBI, the US Department of Justice (DOJ) has also seized almost 130,000 bitcoin worth around $15 billion at the time of the announcement—the largest US cryptocurrency seizure to date. This Prince Group organized crime entity, OFAC says, is made up of the Prince Holding Group, a Cambodia-based company, its chairman and CEO Chen Zhi, and his associates and business partners. Publicly, the company describes itself as “one of the largest conglomerates in Cambodia” and says it is involved in real estate development and financial services. However, the DOJ alleges that “in secret” Chen and other executives “grew Prince Group into one of Asia’s largest transnational criminal organizations” and ran at least 10 scam compounds across Cambodia. “As alleged, the defendant directed one of the largest investment fraud operations in history, fueling an illicit industry that is reaching epidemic proportions,” said Joseph Nocella Jr., a US attorney for the Eastern District of New York, in a statement . “Prince Group’s investment scams have caused billions of dollars in losses and untold misery to victims around the world.” Chen has not been arrested and remains at large, the DOJ says. “The masterminds behind these horrific scam centers are ruining the lives of vulnerable people and buying up London homes to store their money,” Britain’s foreign secretary, Yvette Cooper, said in a statement . The UK also placed financial sanctions on Chen, the Prince Group, and other linked entities. The UK’s sanctions also “freeze” businesses and properties allegedly linked to Chen in London, including a £12 million ($16 million) mansion in North London and a £100 million ($133 million) office building in the City of London.

960adcc108be,This Completely New Kind of Watch Strap Is Made Using Lasers,"apparel, watches, luxury, accessories","Want a watch strap that’s as comfortable as fabric, as light as rubber, as strong as a metal bracelet, and as tactile as a Milanese mesh? Any watch fan looking to tick all of the above boxes would normally expect to be a dab hand with a spring bar removal tool to experience all the above individually, but a new strap developed by Malaysian independent brand Ming appears to now offer the best of all worlds. Photograph: Courtesy of Ming The one strap to rule them all has been dubbed the Polymesh . It is 3D-printed from grade 5 titanium and comprises 1,693 interconnected pieces (including the buckle), held together without any pins or screws. The only additional parts requiring assembly are the quick-release spring bars at each end that attach it to the watch—the articulated pin buckle is also formed in the same process. Ming says the strap, made up of rows of 15 equilateral triangles meshed together and bookended by larger end pieces, “has more motion engineered into the radial axis than the lateral one,” leading to a supple end result that drapes like fabric yet retains the strength of titanium. It has taken the company seven years to develop, working with partners Sisma SpA in Italy and ProMotion SA in Switzerland. Ming says notable challenges included the risk of components fusing together, and the fact that powdered titanium—the raw material from which the strap is laser sintered—is highly explosive. Ming watches co-founder Ming Thein says the project used filament 3D printing initially, before settling on laser sintering, to create larger 5:1 and 3:1 models from plastic to determine if the developing design was valid. “After going through more than seven different topologies to figure out something that would both 3D print and [be] something that would feel right and have the right kinetic properties, we finally settled on the answer,” Thein says in a YouTube video . Amazingly, as the bracelet and buckle must be printed as one unit, Ming had to deal with producing a strap design that demanded clearances of less than 70 microns, the average thickness of a human hair. As a result, each strap takes several hours to produce, requiring hundreds of layers of additive manufacturing in an inert gas environment. The company is not the first to use 3D-printing techniques for final products in watchmaking (as opposed to prototyping), but it is the only one using it for straps or bracelets. British start-up Apiar has debuted a 3D-printed watch case, as has Dutch brand Holthinrichs , which has created versions of its Ornament 1 in both 18-karat gold as well as stainless steel. The Case for Straps To the extent that straps have been an area for innovation in the watch world, recent attention has tended to focus on brands’ development of proprietary mechanisms for swappable straps, to varying degrees of success and popularity. Sustainability programs have focused on leather alternatives such as reclaimed apple peel or mushroom-based material, or textiles woven from ocean plastic . Some have proven difficult to industrialize, and nearly all have been dogged by accusations of greenwashing.

aab6aaa1e3c5,‘Sovereign AI’ Has Become a New Front in the US-China Tech War,"model behavior, artificial intelligence, openai, deepseek, china, donald trump, open source","OpenAI has announced a number of projects this year with foreign governments to help build out what it has called their “sovereign AI” systems. The company says the deals, some of which are being coordinated with the US government, are part of a broader push to give national leaders more control over a technology that could reshape their economies. Over the past few months, sovereign AI has become something of a buzzword in both Washington and Silicon Valley. Proponents of the concept argue it's crucial that AI systems developed in democratic nations are able to proliferate globally, particularly as China races to deploy its own AI technology abroad. “The distribution and diffusion of American technology will stop our strategic rivals from making our allies dependent on foreign adversary technology,” the Trump administration said in its AI Action Plan released in July. At OpenAI, this movement has also meant partnering with countries like the United Arab Emirates, which is ruled by a federation of monarchies. OpenAI’s chief strategy officer, Jason Kwon, argues that partnering with non-Democratic governments can help them evolve to become more liberal. “There’s a bet that you make that engagement is better than containment,” Kwon said in an interview with WIRED last week at the Curve conference in Berkeley, California. “Sometimes that works, and sometimes it hasn't.” Kwon’s reasoning echoes what some politicians said about China more than two decades ago. “We can work to pull China in the right direction, or we can turn our backs and almost certainly push it in the wrong direction,” US president Bill Clinton said in 2000 when China was gearing up to join the World Trade Organization. Since then, many American companies have gotten rich by trading with China, but the country’s government has only become more authoritarian. Some people argue that true sovereignty can only be achieved if a government is able to inspect—and to some extent control—the AI model in question. “In my opinion, there is no sovereignty without open source,” says Clément Delangue, the CEO of Hugging Face, a company that hosts open source AI models. In this respect, China is already ahead, as its open source models are quickly becoming popular globally. What Is “Sovereign AI” Actually? Today’s sovereign AI projects range from giving countries partial to full control over the entire tech stack, meaning the government manages all of the AI infrastructure, from hardware to software. “The one common underlying thing for all of them is the legality portion—by having at least some part of the infrastructure tied to geographical boundaries, the design, development, and deployment would then adhere to some national laws,” says Trisha Ray, an associate director at the Atlantic Council’s GeoTech Center. The deal OpenAI announced in partnership with the US government in the UAE includes a 5 gigawatt data center cluster in Abu Dhabi (200 megawatts of the total planned capacity is supposed to come online in 2026). The UAE is also deploying ChatGPT nationwide, but it doesn’t appear that the government will have any ability to look under the hood or alter the chatbot’s inner workings. Only a few years ago, the idea of building AI infrastructure in authoritarian countries might have sparked worker protests in Silicon Valley. In 2019, Google employees pushed back against the tech giant’s plan to deploy a censored search engine in China, eventually succeeding in getting the project canceled. “What's happening with some of these LLM projects, it's quite similar, but there isn't as much of a backlash,” Ray says. “That notion of, ‘well, yes, if you're operating within a country's borders, you have to adhere to all laws of the land,’ that's become a lot more normalized over time.”",https://www.wired.com/story/openai-sovereign-ai-us-china-tech-war,Technology,wired.com,Zoë Schiffer,"https://media.wired.com/photos/68ed60d1bfe13206c9ff9d9f/191:100/w_1280,c_limit/Biz-model-behavior-stargate-uae-2236543888.jpg",2025-10-14T16:00:00+00:00,4ce3081eedc484f9e178c9f26114969640647155

fda66cdc5272,The Best Wireless Headphones,"shopping, buying guides, headphones, bluetooth, music, audio, wireless earbuds","Other Wireless Headphones We’ve Tested Wireless headphones are the default these days, and there are roughly 1 gazillion of them (and counting). We do our best to test them all, but not everything we test can make the big list. Here are some other good options worth trying. Status Audio Pro X for $249 : The Status Audio Pro X are an excellent pair of earbuds that are slightly overshadowed by their mainstream competitors when it comes to daily use. That said, these buds look and sound awesome, with a triple driver array (one dynamic for bass, two Knowles balanced armatures for mid and high end), which allows them to stand above many other earbuds. Sony WH-1000XM5 for $398 : Sony's XM5 remain a top headphone, even after being supplanted by the fancier XM6. For a fairly sizable price reduction, you'll get still-fabulous noise-canceling tech, great sound, and luxe comfort in a supremely portable package. Beyerdynamic Amiron 300 for $280: These premium earbuds from Beyerdynamic are nondescript-looking and don't have noise-canceling to compete with Sony and Bose, but they do sound fantastic. If you're looking for a great-sounding pair that won't get you judged in public, these are a great option for quiet luxury. Bowers & Wilkins Pi8 Earbuds for $467: Bowers & Wilkins brings its speaker prowess into the world if high-end earbuds. The Pi8 provide a premium and stylish build, excellent sound quality, and solid noise canceling, albeit at a very high price point. Like other earbuds we've tested lately, one of the Pi8's coolest features is the ability to stream audio from wired audio sources via the charging case, which can really come in handy on long flights. Edifier Stax Spirit S5 for $500: These high-flying headphones lack noise-canceling, but make up for it with fantastically clear sound from their advanced planar magnetic drivers that use specialized magnet tech for vividly clear delivery. If you can afford their high price, they're a fun investment that digs into the meat of your music like few headphones in their class. Soundcore Space A40 for $45 : Even though they've moved off our main list, the Space A40 are still among the best earbuds you'll find for the money. Their stylish, premium-looking design is bolstered by solid features, clear and detailed sound, and excellent noise canceling for the price. Sonos Ace for $399: The Sonos Ace are a pricey but impressive first effort from Sonos, with fantastic noise canceling, great sound, and one of the comfiest designs (if not the comfiest) you'll find in the game. A few initial software bugs hindered their performance upon release, including trouble with the TV Swap feature that lets you pass sound from a Sonos soundbar to the Ace, but that seems to be fixed, making these an excellent choice—especially for those already invested in the Sonos way. Beats Solo 4 for $150: We like Beats headphones these days, but this pair was just a bit lacking in features for us at its standard $200 price. Now that they've come down, we can heartily recommend them to folks who are looking for a pair of wireless headphones that don't have noise canceling. Technics EAH-AZ80 for $161 : The AZ80 are great earbuds. Their most noteworthy feature is conveniently pairing to three devices at once, but they finish strong with good noise-canceling tech, top-tier sound quality, and seven different ear tip options for a remarkably comfy fit. Beats Studio Pro for $250 : The Studio Pro offer quality performance, including surprisingly clear sound, good noise canceling, and refreshingly natural transparency mode. The design feels a bit cheap, and they skip features like auto-pause, but extras like Hands-Free Siri and head tracking with spatial audio help pad their value—especially since their sale price sometimes drops to around half of the original $350 MSRP. Sony WH-CH720N for $129 : These Sony cans may have a silly name, but their sheer value makes up for it. They're not as pliable as top options and don't come with a case, but their sound quality and noise-canceling are excellent for the money. They are also built to last and have battery life that goes on and on, making them a great option for prudent shoppers. Master & Dynamic MH40 for $399 : M&D's second-gen MH40 pack gorgeous sound into an equally gorgeous design, with luxurious trappings like lambskin leather and metal parts in place of plastic. Their lack of advanced features, excluding even noise canceling, makes them a pricey portal to minimalism, but they've got style for days. Audio Technica ATH-M50xBT for $219 : The original ATH-M50X provide balanced sound and great durability, making them ubiquitous in music and film studios. But what if you want to take them with you between takes? Enter the ATH-M50XBT, which partner a wired studio connection with Bluetooth for wireless freedom. They don't offer noise canceling or other advanced features but they're great for melding art and play. Sony Linkbuds for $128 : The Linkbuds have a neat trick: speakers with holes in the middle that let in the world around you for environmental awareness. They're not so hot for noisy environments, making them something of a one-trick pony, but they're among the best options in the growing open-ear trend. They've also been updated in the new Linkbuds Open , which are pricier at present but offer a few new features and a more stable fit. JLab Jbuds Mini for $40 : These micro-buds from JLab offer so-so sound, but their adorably teensy design that fits on a key ring makes them a fun accessory for those who need some cheap buds to take on the go. AccordionItemContainerButton If you're new to wireless headphones or need a refresher, here are some helpful pointers to know before you buy. Noise canceling is a technology that employs exterior microphones and digital processing to take in the sounds around you and flip their frequency polarity, essentially canceling them at rapid speeds to create an impression of silence. Transparency mode , aka ""hear-through"" or “ambient” sound mode, is the opposite of noise canceling, using your headphones' exterior microphones to bring in the sound around you. This can keep you aware of your surroundings, especially helpful when working out, walking in high-traffic areas, or just having a quick conversation. Bluetooth is the wireless format used by all portable wireless headphones to connect to and play sound from devices like a phone, computer, or tablet. Bluetooth multipoint connection allows Bluetooth headphones to connect to more than one source device (like a phone or computer) at a time. This helpful feature lets you seamlessly switch between your connected devices to do things like take phone or video calls or watch a video on your computer between Spotify sessions on your phone. Find My is an Apple feature that lets you track down devices like your AirPods from the web. Many non-Apple wireless headphones also have some form of Find My feature, though it's usually reserved for earbuds due to their small size. IP ratings are used to certify electronics are dust and water-resistant. Generally, the higher the IP rating a device has, the better the dust and water resistance. You can learn more in our IP-ratings explainer . EQ stands for equalization, which in the case of wireless headphones, uses digital processing to adjust parameters like bass, midrange, and treble. EQ presets are most common, but multi-band EQs are better for those who want advanced control over each sound register. Charging cases are included with virtually all fully wireless earbuds, letting you set the buds in the case for recharging on the go. Most charging cases offer two or more charges, and to recharge the case itself, you can usually use a USB-C cable or a wireless charger . AccordionItemContainerButton We test headphones and earbuds the way that we live. We take them to the gym, wear them around offices, travel with them, and generally try to use them as we anticipate potential buyers will use them. If a pair advertises dust or water resistance, we test that. We drop test cases, test cables, charging times, and battery life, and note everything we find exceptional to our readers. While we do not typically use a set playlist of music to test each pair, we aim to test acoustic, rock, hip-hop, pop, country, and a variety of other genres with every pair of headphones, ensuring offer a good perspective on sound signature across genres and volumes. For noise reduction, we test the headphones in real-world environments and note our findings. When possible, we attempt to have headphones worn by a variety of people with different head and ear shapes, to ensure we're thinking about the widest audience possible.

9b46d93f8b53,The Best Wireless Earbuds We've Tested,"shopping, buying guides, wireless earbuds, earbuds, headphones, audio","Other Earbuds We Like Every month seems to bring new sets of earbuds with longer battery life, new features, and more compact designs. As such, we can't list everything we like. But if you're still hunting, here are some other recommendations. Beyerdynamic Amiron 300 for $180: These premium earbuds from Beyerdynamic look nondescript and sound fantastic, but they lack any of the superlative qualities of the buds on the list above. If you're after a clean-looking pair of headphones with fantastic vocal definition, they're worth considering. Soundcore Space A40 for $45 : While they're no longer on our main list, the Space A40 are still some of my favorite buds for the money, providing good features, clear sound, and excellent noise canceling for their price class. They also look polished, with only their lack of auto-pause sensors betraying their low price. Samsung Galaxy Buds 2 Pro for $100–$200: The Galaxy Buds 2 Pro are getting older, but they're still among the best buds to pair with a Samsung phone . They don't have the multi-device connectivity of our top pick for Android users, and their five-hour battery is looking pretty short these days, but they provide excellent sound quality, IPX7 waterproofing, and a distinctive design that doesn't just ape the AirPods Pro. That makes them well worth considering on sale. Soundpeats Air4 for $90 : Soundpeats’ Air4 may be obvious AirPods Pro knockoffs, but they're very good knockoffs for the money. You won't get top-flight performance, let alone Apple exclusives like Find My support or iCloud sharing, but you will get good sound and features, including decent noise canceling, at a massive discount. While these aren't a top choice, they're a great budget buy, especially on sale. Sony Linkbuds Fit for $175 : Sony’s Linkbuds Fit offer rich and punchy sound, naturalistic transparency mode, and a light and comfy fit, helping them live up to their intent as a “wear anywhere” solution. They provide some solid features, but skimp on battery life with just 5.5 hours per charge, and their noise canceling is just OK. Their oddly unresponsive touch controls and reliance on flimsy silicone sleeves further diminish their value, but they're still Sony buds and could be worth nabbing on a good sale. Montblanc MTB 03 for $395 : These earbuds are priced out of reach for most buyers, but if you've got the cash, you'll be rewarded with a luxury experience worthy of the brand. Montblanc has called in some heavy hitters from the audio industry to design and voice these buds. The result is a small, comfortable, and quite flashy-looking pair of wireless earbuds that sound really impressive. Raycon Everyday Earbuds for $80 : These YouTuber-beloved earbuds are actually a decent cheap pair . They are small and light, and they come with an IPX6 rating, which makes them great for workouts. Master & Dynamic MW08 Sport for $399 : The Sport are a great option that come with active noise canceling and a striking design, but the high price keeps them out of the reach of most people. Earbuds to Avoid As a general rule, you should avoid earbuds that don't support the Bluetooth 5.0 standard (or higher) or don't offer at least five hours of battery life, and more like six these days. Batteries in wireless headphones degrade over time, so the better your battery life is at first, the more tolerable it will be in two to three years. Apple AirPods (Previous or Current Gen) for $119-$170 : These headphones do some things well, we just don't like them all that much. ( Read our latest review. ) They get OK battery life, come in a compact case, and work well for calls, but they don't fit all ears well, and since they don't have ear tips or wings, you're out of luck if they're loose. The priciest model adds noise canceling which works about as well as you'd expect for a pair that doesn't offer a proper seal. Want clear music, good noise canceling, and advanced features made for iPhones for less than the AirPods Pro 3? Get the AirPods Pro Gen 2 , which sometimes cost more (and sometimes less) but are legitimately great. Beats Solo Buds for $70 : These are lackluster in virtually every possible way , especially when it comes to features for the money. Their best traits are their micro-size and big battery, but that's about it. It's odd, because we like other headphones from the brand, but these just don't keep pace. The best we can say is they are cheap. Samsung Galaxy Buds 3 for $155 : A Cybertrucked pair of AirPods clones , the headphones in the new Galaxy Buds line work worse than they already look. With no eartips, these are uncomfortable to wear for long periods, and the noise canceling is all but useless. How We Define Wireless Earbuds AccordionItemContainerButton We've seen this category go by many names: true wireless earbuds, truly wireless earbuds, completely wireless earbuds, fully wireless earbuds, wirefree earbuds, etc . These days, if a pair of earbuds connects to your phone/computer via Bluetooth and has no cord that connects the left bud to the right, we just call them wireless. Wireless sets typically come with two popcorn-sized buds, each with a battery inside, and a charging cradle that carries extra battery power and keeps them safe when you're not wearing ’em. Some wireless earbuds have a cable or neckband that connects the two buds together, usually found on workout buds from brands like Shokz. Ridding yourself of all cords can feel liberating, but these do come with issues, such as limited battery life (don't buy any with less than five hours), confusing controls, and reliance on a charging case. They're also easier to lose than traditional earbuds, and replacing one bud can be expensive. That said, this is one of the most innovative categories in tech, offering a flurry of new features from heart rate monitors to OTC hearing aid functionality , with more added in each new generation. These days features like noise canceling and transparency mode are standard, while the burgeoning open-ear category offers a more natural way to keep aware of your surrounding.

d1d9582c465c,Review: DJI Mini 5 Pro,"shopping, reviews, review, drones, dji, cameras, outdoors","I enquired about the weight, and a DJI spokesperson sent me the following statement: “The DJI Mini 5 Pro has a design weight of 249.9 grams. Due to manufacturing tolerances, the actual weight of the product may vary slightly within a range of ±4 g. Minor weight fluctuations are normal. We recommend that when UK users are operating the drone, local regulations are complied with, which can be found here .” The company refers to it as a “near-250g drone”—terminology I'd never encountered from DJI. Frankly, it feels a little evasive. This isn't just pedantic nitpicking over a few grams. I live in the UK, and the 250-gram threshold determines whether you can fly a drone in public parks, on beaches, in towns and cities, near people, and in countless other scenarios without additional certification. Previous Mini models have been just under this limit, and it seems like an oversight during the design process to not keep this one comfortably below it, too. There's good news, though: With UK drone rules set to change at the beginning of 2026, I don't have too long to wait until the Mini 5 Pro (and, interestingly, the much bigger DJI Air 3S ) becomes completely legal to fly in built-up areas, public parks, and close to people. The tidings for US-based pilots aren't so cheery, though. As with all of its recent products, DJI isn't officially launching the Mini 5 Pro in the US. You can blame the impending DJI ban , and it's a real shame, because, weight issues aside, this is a fantastic camera drone. Big Camera Upgrades Photograph: Sam Kieldsen The Mini 5 Pro's slight weight increase comes with genuine benefits. The main improvement is the camera, which now features a 12-MP (or 50 MP in Quad Bayer terms) 1-inch sensor, a significant upgrade from the smaller sensors in previous Mini models. The image quality is edging towards DJI's Air range, which is remarkable for a drone this size. You're getting professional-level image quality in a pocketable drone.",https://www.wired.com/review/dji-mini-5-pro,Technology,wired.com,Sam Kieldsen,"https://media.wired.com/photos/68ed9e1d89ace5093d791f1c/191:100/w_1280,c_limit/DJI%20Mini%205%20Pro%20landed%20wide%20shot.jpg",2025-10-14T08:30:00-04:00,f67b42ce0ba4eb55f2af58f44e995e237421e312
247191f43da4,Review: HP EliteBook 6 G1q,"shopping, laptops, computers, windows, hp, windows pcs, reviews, review","Benchmark scores were unsurprising, turning in slightly above-average numbers across the board when compared to other Snapdragon X Plus laptops. Even its battery life of just over 17 hours when playing a full-screen video via YouTube (over Wi-Fi, not HP Go) is about in the middle of all Qualcomm-based systems I’ve encountered—though that’s admittedly still an excellent mark compared to all laptops. The industrial design is utilitarian, though just shy of being completely boring. The silver machine, crafted from partially recycled aluminum and plastic, has a look that feels dated, and at 24 mm thick and 3.2 pounds, it’s also very heavy for a 14-inch system. (It feels heavy in the hand and on the lap as well.) Props, however, for the textured surface on the keyboard caps, which makes for a more pleasant typing experience than most laptops provide—though note it does not offer any backlighting. The trackpad is spacious without being obtrusive in size. Port selection is also solid, including two USB-C ports with USB4 support, two USB-A ports, a full-size HDMI jack, and a drop-jaw Ethernet port. The SIM card slot is also accessible from the side of the device; users can bring their own data plan if they don’t want to use the multicarrier HP Go, which works via eSIM . Poor Value Photograph: Chris Null The G1q is a Copilot+ PC and, as with more general workloads, it turned in perfectly acceptable scores on AI-based jobs like image generation and computer vision tests. It’s plenty stable in daily use; in fact, the only trouble I encountered was during initial setup, when it lost its internet connection midway and forced me to start over from scratch—annoying, but a one-time problem that never cropped up again.",https://www.wired.com/review/hp-elitebook-6-g1q,Technology,wired.com,Christopher Null,"https://media.wired.com/photos/68eda149d38069fa305c069b/191:100/w_1280,c_limit/Review-%20HP%20EliteBook%206%20G1q.png",2025-10-14T08:00:00-04:00,d809f1f5910fb6bc71647937fd6276b82cb551ea
3a8795848753,The Best VPNs for iPhone,"shopping, iphone, ios, apple, vpn, buying guides, phones, smartphones","Other iPhone VPNs We Tested Surfshark : Surfshark was a strong contender for the main list. Even its Starter plan comes with extra features like a masked email generator. Features like ad and tracker blocking, as well as unlimited simultaneous connections, come standard across plans. However, it was a bit slower than my top picks, dropping around 20 percent of speed on average, compared to around 15 percent for the top options. Mullvad : Mullvad is a favorite among privacy enthusiasts, and for good reason. It doesn’t fuss with multi-year discounts or referral programs, and you don’t even need to provide an email to sign up for an account. You can even pay the static monthly fee by mailing Mullvad cash. It’s a great service if privacy is your top priority, but it trades speeds and features in the process. VPN services like Nord and Proton have quickly grown into full privacy and security suites, while Mullvad is more focused on making a robust VPN. In the context of an iPhone, the scales tip more toward those security suites, but Mullvad is still a great privacy-focused option to keep in mind. ExpressVPN : By the numbers, ExpressVPN should be at the top of the list. It has a ton of servers, a featureset that can go toe-to-toe with Nord, and speeds only a touch below Proton. However, ExpressVPN has found itself in a spiral of increasing controversies over the past four years, and the brand has yet to get back on solid footing. After being purchased by Kape Technologies—the company behind the infamous adware company Crossrider—former US intelligence official Daniel Gericke took over at CTO and continued in that role for two years, even after being fined over $300,000 by the US Department of Justice for hacking activities on behalf of a foreign government. Gericke left in 2023, but that same year, ExpressVPN experienced a large swath of layoffs, and Kape, its parent company, was delisted from the London Stock Exchange. The vast majority of shares went to Unikmind Holdings Limited, a company owned by Israeli billionaire Teddy Sagi, who got his start by creating gambling software Playtech. That’s an extremely condensed version of what ExpressVPN has gone through over the past few years. The company hasn’t done anything nefarious, but the revolving door of executive control tied to controversial names doesn’t inspire confidence. Private Internet Access : Private Internet Access, or PIA, is also owned by Kape Technologies, and it followed a similar playbook as ExpressVPN and CyberGhost, which Kape also owns. After the acquisition and community backlash, there’s been very little transparency about what’s going on in the company. A connection to Kape definitely raises questions, but that doesn’t immediately disqualify a service from being included. Unfortunately for PIA, it had much slower speeds than any of the other VPN services I tested, so regardless of ownership, it isn’t a top pick for iPhone VPNs. iPhone VPN Feature Comparison You might be surprised how similar the three VPNs I chose are when you break down their features, but that’s not an accident. Given how restrictive I was with who made the final cut, there’s a pretty high bar for inclusion. Although there are some minor differences, I designed this list in a way that you can choose one of my picks without reading a single word and still come out the other side with an excellent VPN for iPhone. How We Tested To earn the best iPhone VPN title, a service needs to satisfy three criteria. It needs to be secure, fast, and easy to use. That may seem straightforward enough, but there’s a little more that goes into it. For ease of use, I only looked at VPNs that offer a one-tap connection. If you need to configure anything, that’s a disqualification. That still encompasses a lot of the most popular VPNs on iPhone, so I narrowed the field further by focusing on apps that balance usability with power. You should have all the relevant features in the iOS app that are available in the desktop app, and organized in a way that they don’t disrupt that one-tap experience. Speed testing is where I focused a lot of my testing time. Speed testing is highly variable, and trying to come out with one singular number to encompass the speed of thousands of servers is a fool’s errand. The numbers I gathered for this guide are the result of 20 tests I ran for each VPN, then averaged. I tested five locations for each VPN, measuring my unprotected speed immediately before testing and running three passes before averaging. Each location was tested at a different time of day, and I removed any outliers before averaging. For this guide, that meant if there was greater than a 10 percent deviation between two of the three passes. After averaging the speed drop for each location, I gathered all of those numbers together and averaged them for a final speed drop. Finally, security. The traditional wisdom with a VPN is that you, at some point, have to put some faith in the company that its privacy policy is accurate and it isn’t lying about its logging practices. That didn’t do it for me. Again, I set a high bar for inclusion. Every VPN I’ve included here has not only been independently audited, but also been forced to uphold its no-logs policy in legal proceedings. You indeed need to put some trust that the VPN provider you’re using is telling the truth, but the options I included all have rock-solid track records when it comes to transparency.

4257a39666f8,Review: Google Pixel Buds 2a,"google, bluetooth, headphones, earbuds, wireless earbuds, reviews, review, shopping, pixel","As usual, I love the matte white case that comes with these buds; it feels less sticky than the shiny cases from Apple and others, and it makes it slide into pants pockets like a puck on ice. One thing the case doesn't come with is wireless charging; you'll have to stick to USB-C. Battery life is a pleasant seven hours, with a replaceable (!) battery in the case, combining for 20 hours with active noise canceling on and 27 with it off. I like the slimmer profile of the new buds, but I have to admit I didn't notice much of a difference in fit in my average-size ears. Google's app immediately asked me to do a fit test when I paired the headphones with my Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra , and the already-installed medium eartips fit perfectly in my ears. If you have a Pixel phone , you won't even need to install the Pixel Buds app, as it comes preinstalled. App-based features allow you to adjust everything from EQ settings to what the buttons do on each side of the earbuds. It's all simple and intuitive, essentially identical to the experience Apple users have with AirPods, just on a different ecosystem. Touch controls on the outside of each bud are simple. I made one side of the buds call up the Gemini assistant, and the other work for playing and pausing tunes. One oddity is that there isn't a way to adjust volume on the buds themselves; you'll have to press the side buttons on your phone or the volume slider on your laptop to change volume. Depending on how much you like to adjust volume on the fly, this can either be a mild annoyance or a total deal-breaker. I personally find myself using my phone most of the time anyway, so it was merely a quirk. Great Sound Photograph: Parker Hall The Pixel Buds Pro 2 have long been some of my favorite headphones to take with me, thanks to the pebble-y charging case and excellent sound quality. The Buds 2a fit those much more expensive shoes quite well, with similar prowess in the bass and treble, especially.

556994566118,Mark Cuban Would Still Have Dinner With Donald Trump,"big interview, uncanny valley podcast, podcasts, business, pharmaceutical industry, health care, donald trump, silicon valley","Back in May, Mark Cuban appeared in his last episode of ABC’s Shark Tank after spending more than a decade on the show investing in—or deprecating—entrepreneurs’ big ideas. But that doesn’t mean the billionaire is going away. In fact, he’s arguably more everywhere than ever. He’s showing up on TV, posting on Bluesky , and yammering away on podcasts almost daily. Yes, Cuban loves to talk—about ideas, about the future, about what it takes to actually make America healthy again. Or, at least, to get Americans more affordable drugs, which Cuban is endeavoring to do with his startup, Cost Plus Drug Company. Nor does Cuban, like many billionaire businessmen, shy away from talking politics: Does he like President Trump? Doesn’t seem like it. But would he join the president for dinner like so many of his peers have in recent months? With enthusiasm, according to a conversation we had for this week’s episode of The Big Interview . Keep reading to find out why. This interview has been edited for length and clarity. KATIE DRUMMOND: Just so you know—well it's too late now—we always start these conversations with some rapid-fire questions. Like a warm-up. MARK CUBAN: Let's warm up. I am ready. Alright. What is the smartest investment you ever made? Myself. What's the dumbest purchase you ever made? Um, a lot of alcohol. Do you still drink? No. Alright, one word to describe the startup pitches that you hate. Self-absorbed. Would you rather invest in passion or in numbers? Numbers. After health care, what's the next industry ripe for disruption, whether by you or somebody? Education. Tell me a little bit about why. The whole thing is built on accreditation, which is ridiculous in and of itself, as opposed to outcomes. And it's because those accreditation organizations have got so much power there. It influences the structure of universities in particular, and that structure has led to over-emphasis on administrative positions as opposed to actual teaching. It's also allowed cost creep, so that they become, rather than educational institutions, sports institutions that also happen to teach. I think that there’s a great way to teach kids that allows them to learn, that feeds their curiosity, without all the extraneous shit. So are you doing it or what? No. I mean, I've talked about it many times, but health care comes first.",https://www.wired.com/story/the-big-interview-podcast-mark-cuban-cost-plus-drug-company,Technology,wired.com,Katie Drummond,"https://media.wired.com/photos/68d5b2c560ff0db556a23f67/191:100/w_1280,c_limit/Big-Interview-UV-Solo-Mark-Cuban-2204471379.jpg",2025-10-14T10:30:00+00:00,20ef56e9bd001956e156fac1e1a9084a72d20403
ae467895a12d,"Satellites Are Leaking the World’s Secrets: Calls, Texts, Military and Corporate Data","surveillance, privacy, nsa, cybersecurity, security, satellites, t-mobile, at&t, walmart, military, military tech","“Generally, our users choose the encryption that they apply to their communications to suit their specific application or need,” says a spokesperson for SES, the parent company of Intelsat. “For SES’s inflight customers, for example, SES provides a public Wi-Fi hot spot connection similar to the public internet available at a coffee shop or hotel. On such public networks, user traffic would be encrypted when accessing a website via HTTPS/TLS or communicating using a virtual private network.” The researchers reported the swaths of unencrypted satellite communications from the Mexican government and Mexican organizations to CERT-MX, the country’s incident response team, which is part of the government’s National Guard, in April this year, before separately contacting companies. CERT-MX did not respond to WIRED’s repeated requests for comment. A spokesperson for Santander Mexico says that no customer information or transactions were compromised, but confirmed that the exposed traffic was linked to a “small group” of ATMs used in remote areas of Mexico where using satellite connections is the only option available. “Although this traffic does not pose a risk to our customers, we took the report as an opportunity for improvement, implementing measures that reinforce the confidentiality of technical traffic circulating through these links,” the spokesperson says. “While we cannot share specifics, we can confirm that our communications lines have been evaluated and confirmed secure,” a spokesperson for Walmart says. (The researchers confirm that they observed Walmart had encrypted its satellite communications in response to their warning.) “The information of our customers and infrastructure is not exposed to any vulnerability,” a spokesperson for Grupo Financiero Banorte says. Banjercito could not be reached for comment. “SIA and its members remain diligent in monitoring the threat landscape and continue to participate in various security efforts with government agencies, industry working groups, and international standards bodies,” says Tom Stroup, the president of the Satellite Industry Association, adding that it does not comment on specific company issues. Time to Look Up The amount of Mexico-related data in the researchers’ findings is, of course, no coincidence. Although their satellite dish was technically able to pick up transmissions from around a quarter of the sky, much of that swath included the Pacific Ocean, which has relatively few satellites above it, and only a small fraction of the transponders on the satellites it did see were transmitting data in the direction of its dish. The result, the researchers estimate, was that they examined only 15 percent of global satellite transponder communications, mostly in the western US and Mexico. Geostationary satellites ring the Earth’s equator. The researchers’ satellite dish on the roof of their UC San Diego building was in a position to pick at least some signals from about a quarter of that ring. But because many of the satellites’ signals weren’t transmitted towards San Diego—and a large part of their coverage was over the Pacific Ocean, with relatively few satellites—they only received an estimated 15 percent of all geostationary satellite signals. That also means that other dishes placed elsewhere in the world would likely find entirely different signals transmitting different sensitive data.

8009715800da,Our Favorite Computer Monitor Is $75 Off,"deals, shopping, pcs, monitors, dell","If you're tired of staring a tiny laptop screen while working from home, consider scooping up our favorite desktop monitor for almost 25 percent off its normal price. The Dell 27 Plus 4K (8/10, WIRED Reivew) is currently marked down to just $228 on Amazon , the lowest we've seen yet for this smart and practical 4K screen. Dell 27 Plus 4K Monitor (S2725QS) You might be worried about poor panel quality or scarce features, considering the price point, but the Dell S2725QS is surprisingly well equipped for under $300. It has an IPS panel, which is one of the better non-OLED options, with thin bezels and a minimal stand that will fit right into any desk setup. It has 100 percent sRGB coverage, and 79 percent AdobeRGB, with good color accuracy to match, making it a nice choice for light creative work as well. It also has a 120-Hz refresh rate, so while you may want to consider a dedicated screen for gaming, you can certainly jam some weekend Fortnite rounds. AMD FreeSync Premium will help keep things smooth, since reaching frame rates that high will be tough for most systems. You might find that even scrolling the web is much better with a higher refresh rate, though. I know I have trouble going back to 60 Hz. Although it's a little short on ports, lacking any USB in particular, it is VESA compatible if you want to mount it or put it on a stand. It has internal speakers too, and our reviewer, Luke Larsen, was impressed with how they stack up against most built-in monitor speakers. That's not too tough considering they can often be thin and tinny, but it's a nice benefit for anyone lacking the desk space for a nicer, dedicated option. Overall, the Dell 27 Plus 4K is an excellent value, which makes it easy to overlook some of the smaller inconveniences. If you want to spend more for something nicer, make sure to check out the full roundup of our favorite desktop monitors , but most people just looking for a second screen for their work laptop will be exceedingly happy with this Dell.",https://www.wired.com/story/dell-27-plus-deal-1025,Technology,wired.com,Brad Bourque,"https://media.wired.com/photos/68ed359505c586ea21db5bed/191:100/w_1280,c_limit/Save%20Almost%20$75%20on%20our%20Favorite%20Computer%20Monitor.png",2025-10-13T20:35:08.255000+00:00,11b3edaa54ddfdb8c070ca4890fca641073be8c4
c3b78b6c379d,The Best Website Builders for Designing Your Own Site,"shopping, websites, buying guides, web design, how-to, design, software","Top Website Builders Best for Most People Squarespace Core Read More Best Cheap Website Builder Hostinger Website Builder Read More Best Free Website Builder Strikingly Website Builder Read More Publishing a website is still more complicated than it has any right to be, but the best website builders streamline the process. Instead of juggling a bunch of files on a server and learning the ins and outs of networking, website builders do exactly what's written on the tin. Piece by piece, using a drag-and-drop interface, you can design your website the way you want with immediate feedback, rather than spending time buried in code and hoping it comes out on the other end. There are dozens of website builders, and most of them range from decent to straight-up bad. Any web host with a bit of ambition has a website builder floating around, even if it's slow, clunky, and lacking features. I focused on finding the best tools for building your website that go beyond just an add-on, and these are my favorites. If you're after something simpler than a full-blown website, check out our list of the Best Portfolio Websites . Table of Contents AccordionItemContainerButton Best Website Builder for Most Squarespace via Jacob Roach You’ve heard of Squarespace over and over again, I’m sure, and that’s not an accident. It’s an inviting website builder that made a name for itself with bold, striking templates. Beneath the veneer of attractive, but seemingly simple, websites, you’ll find one of the most capable website builders on the market. That balance of power and usability is what sets Squarespace apart. It feels like a creative tool. Where other website builders lag and stutter to get a new element on your page, Squarespace feels fluid. Your dashboard gives you quick access to edit your site, and around every corner, Squarespace feels designed so you never have to look up a tutorial. I started a simple photography website, and within an hour, I had a custom course page set up, an appointment schedule with automated confirmation emails, and services (with pricing and the ability to accept payments) configured. Squarespace isn’t cheap, but it also doesn’t meddle in restrictive, low-cost plans. Even on the Basic plan, you have access to ecommerce tools and space for multiple contributors. Squarespace Pricing and Plans AccordionItemContainerButton Best Cheap Website Builder Hostinger via Jacob Roach Hostinger is better known as a web hosting provider, but it has a surprisingly robust website builder that you can use on its own or for free as part of a hosting package. You don’t get the same world-class template design and dense feature-set of a more expensive builder like Squarespace, but that’s OK. Hostinger’s website builder will run you just a few bucks a month, and based on my testing, it feels heavily angled toward newcomers. You sacrifice some power for convenience, but there’s an awful lot you can accomplish with Hostinger. Integrations with PayPal, Stripe, and Square allow you to quickly set up e-commerce. Add-ons with WhatsApp give you live chat capabilities, and Printful support means you can sell print-on-demand merchandise. And, if you outgrow the website builder, Hostinger allows you to export your website’s content to WordPress. Where Hostinger wins for me is through its AI tools. Just about every website builder these days has AI integrated in some way, but it’s around every corner at Hostinger. You need to pay extra for some of these AI features—the logo generator, for example, requires credits—but they give you a great starting point for mocking up the look, feel, and tone of your website. Hostinger Pricing and Plans AccordionItemContainerButton Best for Small Businesses Wix is undoubtedly the biggest competitor to Squarespace, and I had a hard time putting one above the other. Ultimately, Wix ended up in the backseat due to higher prices and a slightly less intuitive interface. That’s partly because of how powerful Wix is. Rather than corral you in an elegant (if restrictive) website-building workflow, Wix gives you a ton of options. First, templates. You get a few hundred elsewhere, but Wix offers over 2,000 templates. At the time of writing, there are 223 pages of them on Wix’s website. They aren’t all winners, but I was able to mock up a quick photography portfolio website within a few minutes by browsing the templates and uploading a few photos.",https://www.wired.com/story/best-website-builders,Technology,wired.com,Jacob Roach,"https://media.wired.com/photos/68e80dcb34a4e22944e3d3d0/191:100/w_1280,c_limit/Squarespce-source-Squarespace.jpg",2025-10-12T14:00:00+00:00,c333008476e595d879befe631a2946ba3fcf8940
d4f78cb22d7f,Our Favorite Smart Displays for Controlling Your Home,"buying guides, shopping, alexa, google, assistant, smart home","Comparing Our Favorite Smart Displays More Smart Displays We Like Echo Hub for $180 : The Echo Hub isn't exactly a smart display. It lacks powerful speaker capabilities and doesn't have a camera for calls or Amazon's Drop-In video call feature. Instead, it focuses entirely on being a smart home dashboard with built-in Alexa, plus features like widgets and the photo frame. I think it takes the best, most easily used features of a smart display and cuts out the rest. But if you want a good speaker, don't choose this one. Echo Show 5 (3rd Gen, 2023) for $90 : The smaller and cheaper third-gen Echo Show 5 has a 5.5-inch screen that works best on a desk or a bedside table. We think it's a bit too small for the kitchen or living room, but that depends on how you plan to use it. Echo Show 15 for $300 : This is the largest of them all, with a 15.6-inch display, and it has customizable widgets so you can have smart-home device controls and calendar reminders available whenever. It's made to be mounted on your wall like a TV (a stand is sold separately), and the Show 15 pairs with a Fire TV remote (you can use the app) to use the streaming features. With the new Alexa+ I've found myself liking it a lot more, and it's much less distracting than the rotating slideshows you get on smaller Echo Shows. It's a splurge, though, and I still wish the streaming capabilities were better. Google Nest Hub for $100 : Google’s second-gen Nest Hub is a great option if you don't need a camera and don’t mind a smaller 7-inch screen. It has a wake-up alarm that emulates the rising sun for gentler mornings, though it's not bright enough to qualify as a sunrise alarm clock. It also has sleep-tracking tech to track your sleep quality, though the quality of the results isn't great. It also supports gestures—like playing or pausing a video with a hand movement —by using unique radar tech . Google Pixel Tablet for $499 : This tablet doubles as a smart speaker when placed on its speaker dock. It works well, but it's not currently slated to get Google's new assistant, Gemini for Home. If that changes, we'll go back to recommending it. But we're not sure it will: availability has been limited for the speaker base, and could point to this device being discontinued altogether. Smart Displays to Skip We don't like every smart display. Here are the ones we're skipping after trying them out. Echo Show 10 (3rd Gen, 2021) for $250 : This smart display is situated on top of a large cylindrical speaker, which makes it sound great. The screen physically swivels to follow you around the room as you use it, keeping you in frame while you video chat or keeping your streamed workout video in your line of sight as you move about. Because the screen moves around so much, you may have trouble positioning it in tighter spaces—especially in corners. It's a unique model, and is still out of stock like it was this summer. I suspect the upcoming new Echo Show 11 ($220) might replace it, since it has a similar design (but leaves out the movement gimmick). Third-Party Google Displays: Google is no longer updating software for some of the third-party smart displays we used to recommend in this guide. If you have one, it will still work, but some features will likely suffer or disappear entirely as time passes. This seems to be the fate of most third-party Google smart displays, which is why we don't recommend them anymore. Google did say they'll be working with partners to bring Gemini for Home to third-party devices, so we'll see how that pans out. What About Alexa+ and the New Echo Shows? Amazon has been randomly rolling out its new version of Alexa, named Alexa+ , in early access since the spring. This second generation of the Alexa voice assistant is more conversational, able to execute complex tasks and learn new information, and can be much more personalized. That'll be due to its being powered by generative AI. Check out our hands-on with early access Alexa+ for more more about our experience. Unlike the current Alexa, once it's fully available, it'll cost $20 a month or be free if you have an Amazon Prime membership. This is a big jump from the free assistant, but you can keep the current Alexa for free if you don't wish for another subscription or have an Amazon Prime membership. Right now, it's also only available in early access for Echo Show devices. You can sign up here for the wait list. Alexa+ will be immediately available on its newest devices coming this fall, however. There will be two new smart displays, the Echo Show 8 (4th Gen) and Echo Show 11 , and two new smart speakers, the Echo Dot Max and Echo Studio (2nd Gen) . We're curious how the new models will compare to our current favorites, and we will update this guide once we test them. It's also important to note that Alexa+ has forced a privacy change for all Echo devices. Echo devices used to be able to process voice recordings locally on your device, but the “Do Not Send Voice Recordings” privacy feature was killed in March. Now all voice recordings will be sent to Amazon to be processed in order to make Alexa+ function, but even if you don't end up using Alexa+, the feature is gone. What About Gemini for Home and Google’s Smart Displays? Amazon isn't the only one rolling out a new version of its assistant. Gemini for Home is Google's similarly AI-powered smart assistant that will replace Google Assistant in just about all of its available speakers. Unlike Amazon's new assistant, Gemini for Home will be free, but Google is changing its Nest Aware subscription to become a subscription that's both for video storage and for more powerful assistant features. Google is also rolling out a new speaker in the spring, but no new smart display is slated yet. The new assistant will come to all of Google's existing lineup except for the Google Pixel Tablet, which we no longer recommend since it's not currently planned to get support with the new assistant. Google did say they plan to work with third-party partners to bring Gemini for Home to more devices, so we might see new third-party displays that we can recommend again. We'll update this guide as we learn more, but for now, Google's Nest Hub Max and Nest Hub are the best smart displays to purchase if you want access to Google's new assistant. FAQs Do You Need a Smart Display? AccordionItemContainerButton Smart displays are helpful, acting as hubs for your smart home devices, walking you through recipes while you chop away in the kitchen, and in some cases allowing you to video chat hands-free too. But we're not sure how long they'll be worth it, or even exist, in their current form. Companies have been experimenting and doing away with smart displays again and again; Meta discontinued its Portal devices, Google might be discontinuing the Pixel Tablet we favored, and Apple still has yet to even make a smart display. Amazon has continued to make new smart displays, even after losing $10 billion in 2022 thanks to failures around the Alexa voice assistant. The Alexa team was reportedly hit hard by layoffs in 2022 and 2023, but new smart displays continued to come out since then and more are slated to come out later this fall: the Echo Show 8 (4th Gen) and Echo Show 11. The future of these smart home devices isn't clear right now , but if you're going to get one, we suggest sticking with devices directly from the brand whose voice assistant you prefer. Otherwise, consider one of our favorite tablets instead. Does Apple Have a Smart Display? AccordionItemContainerButton So far, Apple has yet to launch its own dedicated smart display. Apple iPhones have a StandBy Mode included in iOS that activates when an iPhone is on its side and charging, using stands like this one from Twelve South . I had hoped this feature would feel similar to a smart display , but StandBy Mode is limited to customizable clock faces, showing your photos, and having your texts pop up in large text that fills the screen. It doesn't scratch the itch of all the features you get in a smart display and instead feels like a fancy alarm clock . What About Digital Calendars? AccordionItemContainerButton There’s a growing market of digital calendars that look a bit like smart displays, but instead of being able to respond to voice commands and stream a video call, these digital screens are designed to have one shared calendar for the entire family to see and view. Skylight, a maker of one of our favorite digital photo frames, makes the Skylight Calendar (starting at $170) that comes in 10 inches, 15 inches, and 27 inches, while I tested the Hearth Display ($699) that comes exclusively in a 27-inch size. Cozyla also makes the Cozyla Calendar+ that starts at 15 inches but goes all the way up to a 36-inch screen. There are some differences in these calendars, but you'll find a similar roadblock to them: memberships. Hearth Display encourages using the display to create routines with your family, specifically kids, though you'll want a kid older than my 2-year-old to use it properly (though the Hearth does have icons designed for kids who can't read yet), and to sign up for the Family Membership. The Skylight touts a photo screensaver and meal planning tools if you sign up for the monthly Plus Plan. You could find these devices are for you, but it's either another device for one parent to manage or something you'll have to teach your entire family to make into a habit to really get the most out of. You're likely better off just teaching everyone in your family to share their Google Calendar. Power up with unlimited access to WIRED .

f2cb84fb4907,Windows 10 Is Dead. Upgrade to One of These Great Windows 11 Laptops,"laptops, shopping, windows, computers, microsoft, dell, lenovo, windows pcs, buying guides","You'll want to read our extensive guide on How to Choose the Right Laptop , but for the basics, you'll want to decide what category of laptop you need. Most people should buy a 13-inch or 14-inch laptop, and spending around $750-$1,000 is a good place to start. You should expect a laptop around this price to get good battery life, have a decent screen, perform well enough for basic tasks, and have a comfortable keyboard and touchpad. You should also expect at least 16 GB of RAM and 512 GB of storage. Anything more than that gets into premium territory where you're paying for higher specs, more performance, or extra features. If you want something with a discrete GPU for either gaming or creative workflows, you'll need to spend more than this. A laptop like the Dell 14 Plus is the ideal example of what you can get while shopping in this price range. You can even find laptops with OLED panels, up to one terabyte of storage, depending on how good discounts happen to be. I would consider anything under $750 to be a cheap laptop , and will therefore come with some significant compromises, especially around the quality of the panel and the touchpad. Fortunately, laptops that use the  Qualcomm Snapdragon X chip get great battery life, despite often falling under $750 in price. Here's a list of important specs to consider: CPU: For thin and light laptops, I would recommend one of the Snapdragon X, X Plus, or X Elite chips. They get the best battery life and performance for their class of laptop. As an alternative, the Intel Core Ultra 7 258V is also quite good. GPU: As of now, the Intel's Lunar Lake chips, such as the Core Ultra 7 258V, have the best integrated graphics. For discrete options, you'll want to pick something with one of the latest Nvidia RTX 50-series GPUs, such as the RTX 5060. The biggest leap in performance there is between the RTX 5070 and the RTX 5070 Ti, which increases VRAM to 12 GB. RAM (or memory): Stick with at least 16 GB if you can. Since the advent of the Copilot+ designation, it ha become the new standard. You'll even find laptops as cheap as $600 that have 16 GB of memory. Gamers and content creators should upgrade to 32 GB if possible. Storage: Similar to memory, many laptops have moved to 512 GB as the new standard, and you'll find lots of affordable laptops with 512 GB as the base configuration. Upgrading to one or two terabytes, where possible, will make your life that much easier, especially since many laptops don't offer expandable storage. Display: Laptops are usually categorized by screen size, with 13-inch, 14-inch, and 16-inch being the most common. You'll want to consider size, resolution, refresh rate , and panel type here. Portability: Outside of display size, thickness of the chassis and weight are the primary factors here, determining how portable a laptop is to travel with. Other dimensions are important too, but more often than not, that is determined by the screen size. Ports: Many laptops are limited to just USB-C and headphone jack these days, with some exceptions where USB-A or HDMI are included. Make sure your laptop has what you need, or else you'll need a USB Hub or laptop docking station to get more ports or to increase external display support.",https://www.wired.com/gallery/best-windows-laptops,Technology,wired.com,Luke Larsen,"https://media.wired.com/photos/68e972a9adf8b328300b90b3/191:100/w_1280,c_limit/Windows%2010%20Is%20Dead.%20Upgrade%20to%20One%20of%20These%20Great%20Windows%2011%20Laptops.png",2025-10-13T12:00:00+00:00,115f99c504571b96332341be5c52b0a74567deef
4d8b46b6b44a,"Programming in Assembly Is Brutal, Beautiful, and Maybe Even a Path to Better AI","machine readable, coding, programming, computers, software","Rollercoaster Tycoon wasn’t the most fashionable computer game out there in 1999. But if you took a look beneath the pixels—the rickety rides, the crowds of hungry, thirsty, barfing people (and the janitors mopping in their wake)—deep down at the level of the code , you saw craftsmanship so obsessive that it bordered on insane. Chris Sawyer, the game’s sole developer, wrote the whole thing in assembly. Certain programming languages, like Python or Go or C++, are called “high-level” because they work sort of like human language, written in commands and idioms that might fit in at a poetry slam. Generally speaking, a piece of software like a compiler transforms this into what the machine really reads: blocks of 1s and 0s (or maybe hex) that tell actual transistors how to behave. Assembly, the lowest of the “low-level” languages, has a near one-to-one correspondence with the machine’s native tongue. It’s coding straight to metal. To build a complex computer game from assembly is like weaving a tapestry from shedded cat fur. Why would anyone do this? I recently asked Sawyer, who lives in his native Scotland. He told me that efficiency was one reason. In the 1990s, the tools for high-level programming weren’t all there. Compilers were terribly slow. Debuggers sucked. Sawyer could avoid them by doing his own thing in x86 assembly, the lingua franca of Intel chips. We both knew that wasn’t the real reason, though. The real reason was love. Before turning to roller coasters, Sawyer had written another game in assembly, Transport Tycoon . It puts players in charge of a city’s roads, rail stations, runways, and ports. I imagined Sawyer as a model-train hobbyist—laying each stretch of track, hand-sewing artificial turf, each detail a choice and a chore. To move these carefully crafted pixels from bitmaps to display, Sawyer had to coax out the chip’s full potential. “ RollerCoaster Tycoon only came about because I was familiar with the limits of what was possible,” he told me. Working within the limits? A foreign idea, perhaps, in this age of digital abundance, when calling a single function in an AI training algorithm can engage a million GPUs. With assembly, you get one thing and one thing only, and it is the thing you ask for—even, as many a coder has learned the hard way, if it is wrong. Assembly is brutal and beautiful that way. It requires you to say exactly what you mean. I’ve done assembly’s creators a disservice. They wanted things to be easier, not harder. I imagine they were tired of loading up punchcards and flipping switches on their steampunk leviathans. Perhaps they dreamed of a world like ours, where computers can do so much with such minimal guidance.",https://www.wired.com/story/programming-assembly-artificial-intelligence,Technology,wired.com,Gregory Barber,"https://media.wired.com/photos/68e6c45f693f7ce213ae491f/191:100/w_1280,c_limit/MR%20011%20'Assembly%20Codes'.jpg",2025-10-13T11:00:00+00:00,58163628e49b9ee6948c5670e321f73418678b7b
73c3efd70e75,How to Make STEM Funny—and Go Viral Doing It,"stem, comedy","Stop me if you’ve heard this one before. An aspiring chemist goes to college, realizes she’s not good at chemistry, and bombs her dissertation. She takes a class in standup comedy and decides the best way to talk about STEM is to make jokes at its expense. This isn’t a punchline. It’s Freya McGhee’s life. Based in London, the comedian had a strong interest in science as a kid, but after attending the University of Brighton to study chemistry, she realized that she liked learning science more than she liked applying it. Her thesis dissertation—“Synthesis of Iron Nitroxide radical species using radical derivatized ligands and its use as a single-molecule magnet”—flopped. She evaporated her results in the lab. “I was like ‘I don’t know what to do anymore,’” McGhee says. “I feel like if someone else did it, they might get further along with it, but for me it definitely didn’t work. It was a nightmare.” As she was finishing her degree she started studying stand-up and turned that nightmare into a pretty good bit . It’s gotten 4.4 million views on Instagram. McGhee’s stand-up sets regularly get hundreds of thousands or millions of views—and lots of fun comments. WIRED reached McGhee at home in London to talk about what it takes to make STEM funny. This interview has been edited for length and clarity . ANGELA WATERCUTTER: Obviously you made a pretty abrupt turn from chemistry to comedy, but when you first started doing stand-up were you joking about STEM then, or did you find your way there over time? FREYA MCGHEE: When you’re newer I think it’s easier to get laughs for dating jokes and stuff that’s relatable. But if you’re coming onstage, especially in front of a non-science crowd, trying to get them to laugh at science stuff is really hard. You have to explain the science and then tell the joke. You lose momentum. Right. There’s too much setup. But then I realized if I did it with a PowerPoint, if I just put the science up as a PowerPoint, it was much easier for people to understand. When I figured that out it was endgame really. Yes, your sets kind of feel like an advanced high school science course with a very funny instructor. Yeah, it's very on-brand, isn't it? It just made logical sense to me. Like, if I put it into a visual, it cuts out the part of the joke that’s losing momentum. Or I can get to the punchline quicker if I use a visual aid. But it does feel funny to be doing science jokes and holding a clicker as well.

7ac2851a2dcc,New Rules Could Force Tesla to Redesign Its Door Handles. That’s Harder Than It Sounds,"electric vehicles, tesla, cars, automobiles, evs and hybrids, manufacturing","The issues could cascade beyond the design. The auto manufacturing industry operates on strict production schedules. Though it builds in time to validate and test whatever new features come in each new model, the sudden intro of a design change late in the process could throw off the delicate timetable. In this decade, China’s auto industry has shocked the world by racing ahead of legacy automakers, quickly developing, with government support, ever newer, cheaper, and more technologically advanced vehicles on shorter production schedules. The country is the world’s largest automotive market; it’s expected to manufacture a full third of the world’s cars by 2030 . Still, quickly complying with new design regulations won’t be easy for domestic Chinese automakers either, says Broglin-Peterson. “Mechncial release requires a mechanical assembly,” she says. “It’s not just, you write some code.” Automaker’s door handle trouble likely won’t end in China. The new rules could lead to cascading responses from other global regulators. It’s a now-familiar pattern: China, once a place with lax protections, has forged ahead of the rest of the world in setting guidelines for electric vehicle battery safety and recycling, and autonomous vehicle tech. “This is a classic example of China setting the guardrails early: protecting consumers while quietly shaping global design standards,” Bill Russo, the CEO of Automobility, a Shanghai-based advisory firm, wrote in an email. A Handle on Design For many years, says Raphael Zammit, the chair of the transportation design department at the College for Creative Studies in Detroit, flush electronic door handles were the stuff of futuristic concept cars. “The fact that Elon Musk and Tesla put it into production was, frankly, pretty amazing,” he says. Their rise was linked with the increasing popularity of electric vehicles; tucking door handles into the doors of cars was meant to reduce their drag coefficient, leading to increased battery efficiency. Or so the theory went: Back-of-the-envelope math suggests the tweak maybe adds a mile of range. Maybe. Either way, the handles became a “demarcation of luxury,” Zammit says. Indeed, electronic door handles can be found on many luxury vehicles, including some made by Volkswagen, General Motors, Ford, and Mercedes-Benz. Jake Fisher, the senior director of the Consumer Reports’ Auto Test Center, tested several of those vehicles’ electronic handles . While all had emergency mechanical releases, as the Chinese regulations mandate, some were in places that could be difficult to find in an emergency—on the floor, in shadow, or, as in the rear seats of the 2021 Model Y under investigation by NHTSA, under a slot at the bottom of the rear door pocket. The best emergency mechanical releases, Consumer Reports found, were those that simply needed to be pulled a bit harder than usual to open, an intuitive reaction in an emergency.",https://www.wired.com/story/new-rules-could-force-tesla-to-redesign-its-door-handles-thats-harder-than-it-sounds,Technology,wired.com,Aarian Marshall,"https://media.wired.com/photos/68e4035668d91f2b22fd4f9c/191:100/w_1280,c_limit/gear-telsa-door-handle-shutterstock_2679655353.jpg",2025-10-13T10:00:00+00:00,ece54b04d8299110dbbf3526e9ea860a90bd8775
a065ebddcb86,The ‘Womanosphere’ Is Reshaping the Conservative Dating Landscape,"social media, politics, sex, dating apps, donald trump, influencers, content creators","Anya Lacey is aware of the oxymoron that comes with being an OnlyFans creator while aspiring to be a trad wife. When the 19-year-old Florida-based creator decided to get serious about dating this year, she ran into a wall. Either a lot of conservative men are “immediately turned off by what I do,” she says of being a sex worker, or the men she met on dating apps weren’t all that serious about commitment. “It’s a video game to them.” Those experiences led Lacey to create dateanya.com , a website with two clear objectives. The first was to find Lacey a husband (users can fill out a “Date Me” application). The second—and this very much seems to be its larger aim—was for the site to serve as a kind of relationship roadmap for conservative singles serious about finding love. Billed as “America-First Dating,” the site provides suggestions for “non-negotiables” (“secure borders, secure families”) as well as dating tips for women (“let him drive the date; you drive the conversation”) and men (“exclusivity before intimacy”). “Conservatism is really associated with men and masculine energy, and that’s who was leading the industry,” Lacey says. “But now you have a lot of women coming out of the woodwork.” Lacey is part of an expanding network of women influencers, creators, and media personalities who represent different factions of the conservative movement—spanning faith and flag moderates to MAGA fanatics—jockeying for a larger stake in the dating zeitgeist. Some are using their platform to reclaim the narrative around traditional relationships, one they say has been poisoned by feminist brainwashing and an age of endless swipes. Just as the manosphere has shaped the outlook of young conservative men through chat-casts, rallying a generation around alternative science and hypermasculinity, the rise of female-led rightwing media creators—sometimes called the “womanosphere”—are helping to shape the opinions of young conservative women everywhere. But even as conservatives are reclaiming the debate around modern dating, coasting on the momentum of Trump 2.0, there are noticeable fractures and hypocrisies in their approaches. On the podcast Culture Apothecary, Turning Point USA’s Alex Clark educates women about optimal fertility health and well-being. In an episode of Relatable titled “Be a Godly Woman, Not Just a Trad Wife,” host Allie Beth Stuckey discusses the appropriation of the trad wife trend, saying it “can be a great thing to aspire to” but Christian motherhood is “not just an aesthetic.” More recently, in response to polycule family structures, Stuckey noted that “the sexual revolution is reaching new lows.” Much of what the women discuss—on marriage, faith, and the importance of childbearing—dovetails with the agenda of the Trump administration. On social media, however, where Lacey has more than 1 million followers between TikTok and Instagram, she often straddles her conservatism with a wink and a smile. In one video , Lacey jokes about the consequences of not performing oral sex on your partner.

f061c8e5dfa8,More Evidence Emerges That One of Saturn’s Moons Could Harbor Life,"science, space, saturn, extraterrestrial life","A recent study of Enceladus, one of Saturn’s moons, has detected several organic compounds that had never been recorded there before. The findings, published this month in Nature Astronomy , provide new clues about the interior chemical composition of this icy world, as well as new hope that it could harbor life. The researchers analyzed data from the Cassini probe, which launched in 1997 and studied Saturn and its moons for years until its destruction in 2017. For Enceladus, Cassini gathered data from ice fragments forcefully ejected from the moon’s subsurface ocean up into space. Enceladus is one of 274 bodies so far discovered in Saturn’s gravitational pull. It measures about 500 kilometers in diameter, making it the planet’s sixth-largest satellite. While this moon does not stand out for its size, it is notable for its cryovolcanoes—geysers at Enceladus’s south pole that spew out water vapor and ice fragments. Plumes of ejected material can extend to nearly 10,000 kilometers in length , which is more than the distance from Mexico to Patagonia, and some of this material rises into space. The outermost of Saturn’s main rings—its E ring—is primarily made up of ice ejected into space by Enceladus. This material is believed to come from a saline water chamber beneath the moon’s icy crust that is connected to its rocky core. It’s possible that chemical reactions are taking place down there, under high pressure and heat. Until now, most chemical analyses of ice from Enceladus were of particles deposited in Saturn’s E ring. But during a high-speed flyby of the moon in 2008, Cassini was fortunate enough to directly sample freshly ejected fragments from a cryovolcano. The new research paper reanalyzed this data, confirming the presence of previously detected organic molecules, as well as revealing compounds that had previously been undetected. “Such compounds are believed to be intermediates in the synthesis of more complex molecules, which could be potentially biologically relevant. It is important to note, however, that these molecules can be formed abiotically as well,” Nozair Khawaja, a planetary scientist at Freie Universität Berlin and lead author of the study, told Reuters . The discovery significantly expands the range of confirmed organic molecules on Enceladus. The key is that the compounds appeared in freshly ejected particles, suggesting that they were formed within the moon’s hidden ocean or in contact with its internal interfaces, not during their journey through the E ring or via exposure to the conditions of space. This reinforces the hypothesis that hydrothermal processes beneath Enceladus’s surface could be generating rich organic chemistry. Combining this new research with previous studies, scientists have now found five of the six elements essential for life—carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus, and sulfur—in the satellite’s ejected material. This itself is not a discovery of life, nor of biosignatures—the signs of life. However, the research confirms that Enceladus has the three basic conditions for life to form: liquid water, an energy source, and essential elements and organics. “Enceladus is, and should be ranked, as the prime target to explore habitability and search whether there is life or not,” Khawaja said.

744c541e6059,"Skeleton-filled well in Croatia likely holds remains of Roman soldiers, study finds",,"Archaeologists excavating an ancient well in eastern Croatia have discovered the skeletons of seven men whose bodies had been tossed in haphazardly. Experts think the remains belong to Roman soldiers who fought in the Battle of Mursa in A.D. 260. The skeletons were originally recovered in 2011 in an archaeological dig ahead of planned construction at a university in Osijek, which was known as the town of Mursa during the Roman Empire . Although the skeletons were complete, they were found in varying positions in the well, including head-down. ""Presumably, all of the individuals were stripped of any valuables — weapons, armor, equipment, jewelry, etc. — before they were thrown into the well,"" study lead author Mario Novak , a bioarchaeologist at the Institute for Anthropological Research in Zagreb, Croatia, told Live Science in an email. Novak and his colleagues published their analysis of the skeletons Wednesday (Oct. 15) in the journal PLOS One . All seven skeletons belonged to adult males, four of them younger adults and three middle-aged adults, the researchers wrote in the study. Several of the men had sustained injuries prior to death, including blunt force trauma to the forehead, rib fractures and weapon wounds. Additionally, a layer of new bone on the inside of their ribcages, which is often seen in infections or injuries, suggested that all the men likely had a lower respiratory tract infection just prior to death. The researchers carbon-dated four of the skeletons to the second half of the third century, a date range that matched the only artifact recovered from the well: a Roman coin that was minted in A.D. 251. The composition of the group of skeletons — namely, young and middle-aged males with violent injuries — ""is almost identical to those seen in battle-related assemblages"" in mass graves, such as the remains of soldiers from Napoleon's Grand Army , the researchers wrote.

Archaeologists discovered puncture wounds on two skeletons; left: top part of the breastbone; right: back of the right hip. (Image credit: Mario Novak et al., PLOS One; ( CC BY 4.0 )) Given the mass grave's location in ancient Mursa, an important settlement near the Roman military border zone, the researchers concluded that the skeletons likely belonged to men who fought in the Battle of Mursa in A.D. 260. During the "" Crisis of the Third Century "" (A.D. 235 to 284), various people fought to lead the Roman Empire. The Battle of Mursa was contested by Emperor Gallienus and the Roman military commander Ingenuus , who unsuccessfully attempted to usurp the throne. The men in the well may be some of Ingenuus' supporters, the researchers suggested, because historical sources state that Gallienus showed no clemency toward the defeated army. Further analysis of the men's DNA showed ""high genetic diversity,"" according to the study, which ""aligns with historical accounts of Late Roman armies, which frequently incorporated ethnically diverse groups such as Sarmatians, Saxons and Gauls."" Kathryn Marklein , a bioarchaeologist at the University of Louisville in Kentucky who was not involved in the study, told Live Science that the researchers made a strong argument for the military nature of the mass grave at Mursa. ""This research is critical to understanding the direct and violent consequences of political instability during the third century,"" Marklein said, and for understanding ""how this instability affected populations in the provinces and along the Roman frontiers."" Additional work is planned on a second mass burial found in another well in Mursa, Novak said, which is very similar to the one in the new study.

fa8ddddb18c9,"Jane Goodall revolutionized animal research, but her work had some unintended consequences. Here's what we've learned from them.",,"Two weeks on from Jane Goodall's death , many have been reflecting on her life, including her scientific legacy and how she changed humanity's connection to the natural world. As a pioneering primatologist, Goodall was the first to spy many behaviors and characteristics in the chimpanzees ( Pan troglodytes ) of Tanzania's Gombe National Park that had been assumed to be unique to humans, including tool use, warfare and personalities . Goodall’s observations revolutionized our understanding of chimps; and her unconventional approach, stemming from a lack of formal scientific training, enabled her to make several contributions that changed the face of animal research. Yet this would prove to be a double-edged sword, leading her to use methods that primatologists no longer consider helpful today. So what were Goodall's contributions to primatology? And did any fall short? Live Science spoke to chimpanzee experts to unpack her enduring impact on chimp research, including how some of her initial observations biased our understanding of how chimps think and behave, and the ways scientists have learned from the unintended consequences of her early decisions. One of the most notable examples of Goodall’s unwitting defiance of strict scientific conventions can be found in her giving individual names to the Gombe chimpanzees and remaining open-minded to their capabilities. ""She didn't know that she wasn't supposed to give them names. She didn't know that you weren't supposed to talk about feelings and emotions and personal histories,"" Elizabeth Lonsdorf , a professor of anthropology at Emory University who studies the Gombe chimps, told Live Science. ""Her real gift to us was firmly planting that as a basic understanding of chimpanzees so that we can design better science with that in mind."" Recognizing the need to consider the personal histories of chimps was pivotal, and by establishing the first long-term study of chimps, Goodall ignited an entire research field. The Gombe chimps are now followed daily by a dedicated team of expert Tanzanian trackers, and, since 1960, scientists have collected over 165,000 hours of data on their behavior . Get the world’s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox. Researchers can now track chimpanzees' development from birth to old age using these data, watching how each generation transfers skills and knowledge onto the next. ""Chimps live 60 years so you can't actually ask those questions without five, six decades of research,"" Lonsdorf said. The Gombe community now contains the fifth generation of chimpanzees descended from the original chimps Goodall studied, with family lineages grouped according to the first letter of their mothers' names. 'Friendship' as the 'F'-word in primatology Naming chimps goes beyond tracking, and has opened the door to new research avenues. Laura Simone Lewis , a primatologist at the University of California, Santa Barbara, told Live Science that while captive chimps clearly respond to their own names, she is currently investigating whether they also recognize those given to their groupmates. Finding evidence that chimps keep track of each other's names would suggest that the underlying capacity to understand social labels could have emerged before the evolution of human language, Lewis said. ""That comes directly from Jane's work of naming chimpanzees."" This research also carries on Goodall's work of investigating social bonds in chimps. Lewis noted that many of Goodall’s early observations about the social and emotional lives of chimps were anecdotal, and so were discounted. In fact, ""friendship"" was considered the ""f"" word in primatology for over 40 years after Goodall's first observations. Lewis is still careful when using the term, yet its growing acceptance among primatologists is based on years of empirical research , and points to the validity of Goodall's first insights. ""We often call them close social relationships, but what they really are are friendships. And they are long-lasting, very closely bonded relationships between animals that can last for decades."" Young chimpanzees in the Côte d'Ivoire playing (Image credit: Liran Samuni/Taï Chimpanzee Project) This sentiment is echoed elsewhere. Liran Samuni , a primatologist at Harvard University who studies cooperation and intergroup relationships in chimps, said that despite chimps' bad reputation for aggression, she ""cannot think of a primate species [aside from humans] that is also as cooperative and as dedicated to each other as chimpanzees are."" The distinction is that chimps are very friendly to their ingroup and ""systematically hostile to the outgroup,"" Sylvain Lemoine , a primatologist at the University of Cambridge, told Live Science. Chimpanzees' ""social landscape is made of their own community and of the neighboring communities,"" Lemoine said. And at any time, they run the risk of being ambushed by hostile neighbors, he added. Goodall’s observations on chimp aggression were also foundational. She was the first to observe lethal aggression between chimpanzee groups, and documented what has become known as the Gombe Chimpanzee War , which was a four-year-long conflict caused by the splintering of the Kasakela community. At first, Lemoine said, researchers dismissed this as an artificial behavior that resulted from Goodall feeding the chimps bananas — called ""provisioning."" By plying the chimps with food, Goodall could entice the whole group to one central spot to observe their interactions more easily. However, this high concentration of sought after resources dangerously heightened the competition between the chimps. It is now known that intergroup violence is common across chimp populations, and ""whether this community in Gombe split because of the provisioning is another question,"" Lemoine said. This exemplifies an important point, however. While Goodall's open-mindedness meant she ignored unproven presumptions made by experts during her time, such as warfare being unique to humans, she also made decisions that ultimately had unexpected negative repercussions. Not all chimps are Gombe chimps The fact that Goodall’s early work was centred on one community at one site, Gombe National Park, also created another unintended consequence: The long-lasting assumption that the behavior and social structure of the Gombe chimps was the same across all chimp communities. ""This is something that people who study chimpanzees are still grappling with,"" Samuni said. We now know that chimps across Africa can vary considerably from one another. For example, the intensity of intergroup competition among chimps varies depending on the animals’ social structures, Samuni told Live Science, with a 2014 large-scale study published in the journal Nature finding that East African chimps were more lethal than those in West Africa. They also found that groups with more adult males witnessed a greater number of killings . Female chimpanzees in Taï patrolling their borders with their offspring. (Image credit: Oscar Nodé-Langlois/Taï Chimpanzee Project) Also, Goodall observed that female chimps were antisocial, generally sticking to themselves while males gathered to interact. This is true on its face: Females in East African chimp communities, like those in Gombe, do tend to be more peripheral members of the group, Samuni explained. But this is far from true everywhere. Females in West African chimp communities are ""extremely central to the social network,"" Samuni said. Nonetheless, the first impression made by Goodall’s observations left a long-lasting presumption that all female chimps were antisocial, a bias that took years to overturn . However, Lonsdorf said that she never viewed Goodall's work as putting blinders on researchers. Goodall's observations simply lay the groundwork for studying variation by developing a ""baseline framework of how a chimpanzee behaves,"" she said. Times have changed A lot has changed since Goodall's initial observations. These days, the Gombe chimps are given Swahili names rather than English ones, and naming individuals in the local language is common across sites. In addition, chimpanzees are no longer provisioned at any site. Also, researchers can now collect data beyond observations. ""Nowadays, our science is largely interdisciplinary or multidisciplinary,"" Alejandra Pascual-Garrido , a primatologist at the University of Oxford who works with the Gombe chimps, told Live Science. There is now a genetics lab in Gombe, making it possible for researchers to study paternity and the health of the gene pool . The days of closely interacting with chimpanzees as Goodall did are likewise long gone. Researchers now wear masks to avoid getting animals sick and keep their distance to stay safe, and primatologists work to ensure photographs of people very close to primates aren't shared as they can undermine conservation efforts and encourage the pet trade . Pascual-Garrido noted that the old images of Goodall hugging chimpanzees would be considered ""completely unacceptable"" by primatologists nowadays. It's important to remember that Goodall was doing what seemed to work at the time, and had no other site to learn from. Samuni said ""the fact that she did not come with those predefined ideas and concepts actually allowed her to see things that other people may have missed or may have thought, 'okay, it cannot exist.'"" Pascual-Garrido agreed. ""She saw the world differently and she made the world see the world differently,"" she said.",https://www.livescience.com/animals/land-mammals/jane-goodall-revolutionized-animal-research-but-her-work-had-some-unintended-consequences-heres-what-weve-learned-from-them,Science,livescience.com,,https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/NVZRet4FHjCrSBDKrPWtKZ-2560-80.jpg,2025-10-15T17:11:38+00:00,470fc1d337a3c4ae5491e9dd4a65ce869d9e0317
8aa5f13dbdab,Cheaper than Prime Day: Our favorite telescope is now $300 off at Amazon,,"We saw some great deals during Prime Day, but just one week later, Amazon has slashed $300 off the Celestron NexStar 8SE . Known as the ""world's most beloved telescope,"" it's rated exceptionally well across the board and loved by both seasoned astronomers and new beginner stargazers with a healthy budget. We only saw a $100 reduction on this telescope during Prime Day, and there's no guarantee it'll be discounted for Black Friday on November 28, either, so this is a rare deal that you won't want to miss. Do yourself a favor and get the Celestron NexStar 8SE for $1,399 at Amazon before the deal is gone. We praised its legendary optical quality and power in our full Celestron NexStar 8SE review , and it's held the top spot among the best telescopes for a long time. Sure, it's not a budget telescope, but if you can afford the NexStar 8SE, you could quite easily go your whole life not having to invest in another telescope. Its 8-inch aperture is fantastic for viewing the solar system and beyond, and with some comets and supermoons gracing our skies over the next few months, now is the perfect time to take advantage of this saving. Image 1 of 4 The classic orange tube is eye-catching and notorious with Celestron. (Image credit: Jason Parnell-Brookes) With the hand controller, you can align the telescope and locate different celestial subjects. (Image credit: Future) It comes with a 25mm eyepiece. (Image credit: Future) The NexStar 8SE requires 8 AA batteries. (Image credit: Future) It comes with almost everything you need to get going, including the optical tube itself, a tripod and accessory tray, motorized mount, hand controller, finderscope, 25mm eyepiece, star diagonal, Bluetooth shutter release button and a backpack. The only thing that isn't included is the 8 x AA batteries needed to power the motorized mount. We'd have liked it to come with a few more eyepieces, so we'd recommend investing in some Plossl eyepieces and a Barlow lens, like in this Celestron kit , but overall, we think this deal is great value for money. Key features: 8-inch aperture, 80-inch (2,032 mm) focal length, f/10 focal ratio, 180x highest useful magnification, 32 pounds (14.48 kilograms) total kit weight, two-year warranty. Price history: This is the cheapest we've seen it since January 2025, when it went down to $1,299. It wasn't even this cheap during either Prime Day events this year. Price comparison: Amazon: $1,499 | Walmart: $1,699 | Best Buy : $1,699 Reviews consensus: Our review says: ""Beginner astronomers could go their whole lives without swapping out this telescope for another, and intermediate or advanced astronomers will benefit from the go-to motorized function and scalability with additional accessories. Although, casual astronomers with tighter budgets may want to look for something cheaper.""

fe75edaa8b49,James Webb telescope finds something 'very exciting' shooting out of first black hole ever imaged,,"New images from the James Webb telescope have captured previously unseen details of the gargantuan jets shooting out of the famous black hole M87* — the first-ever black hole to be directly imaged by the Event Horizon Telescope. The new James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) images, published Sept. 22 in the journal Astronomy & Astrophysics , have also revealed the clearest views yet of the massive counter-jet that's ricocheting through space in the opposite direction, the study authors found. The jet of subatomic particles spewing out of the supermassive black hole at the center of the gigantic galaxy Messier 87 (M87), located 54 million light-years from Earth, is catapulting through space at almost the speed of light. Previous radio wavelength observations from the Very Large Array (VLA) in New Mexico revealed that the jet is shaped like a double-helix and is about 8,000 light years long. Although supermassive black hole jets are somewhat common, ""the M87 jet is special in the sense that it is fairly close by (on astronomical scales), and very bright across the spectrum,"" study co-author Jan Röder , an astrophysicist at the Institute of Astrophysics of Andalusia in Spain, told Live Science in an email. This makes it ""an ideal laboratory to study jet physics,"" he said. The black hole M87* is a supermassive black hole with an equivalent mass of about 6.5 billion suns. It was the first black hole to be directly photographed by the Event Horizon Telescope — an array of eight globally linked radio telescopes — in 2019. The black hole and its jets have been frequently studied since then, with recent research finding that the cosmic monster is spinning at close to 80% of the cosmic speed limit , and that the magnetic fields surrounding the black hole have changed dramatically in just a few short years. Very Large Array image of the M87 radio jet, made at multiple radio frequencies. The jet seen in this image is about 8,000 light-years long, originating at the bright spot at the left, at the core of the galaxy, where a supermassive black hole resides. (Image credit: Pasetto et al., Sophia Dagnello, NRAO/AUI/NSF.) Previous research has peeked at the jet using various electromagnetic wavelengths , including radio waves, visible light, ultraviolet radiation, X-rays and gamma rays. But its structure at the infrared scale, which Röder said is key for connecting the radio and visible light images, was unknown. Get the world’s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox. Now, Röder and his team have used infrared images of M87 taken in June 2024 by JWST's Near Infrared Camera (NIRCam) to study the jet like never before. First, the team isolated the jet in the images by modelling the galaxy and then scrubbing away its light emissions; as well as any extra stars, dust and background galaxies. They then used these cleaned images to identify all the individual features of the jet at four wavelengths of infrared light. The two shorter-wavelength images were particularly high definition, and captured one of the brightest sections of the jet, called HST-1, near the galaxy's core. Previous research modelled HST-1 using X-ray data and found it was made up of two light emitting regions . These images are the first direct observations confirming this structure, Röder said. The two longer-wavelength images show a faint C-shaped counter-jet spurting from the core in the opposite direction of the main jet. While the counter-jet also appears in radio wave photos, Röder said that the clarity achieved in the infrared images was ""very exciting."" Continuing to snap photos at different wavelengths will help scientists to understand how the jet interacts with its cosmic surroundings and what the jet and its opposite are made of. ""With every new observation, we inch closer to the complete picture,"" Röder added.",https://www.livescience.com/space/black-holes/james-webb-telescope-finds-something-very-exciting-shooting-out-of-first-black-hole-ever-imaged,Science,livescience.com,,https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/8SCkB77698KjdTauV2Aa8F-1200-80.jpg,2025-10-15T15:22:27+00:00,ef841bc57b457aeee9c0b10b25314d1e326eaaad
707989042615,Methane leaks multiplying beneath Antarctic ocean spark fears of climate doom loop,,"A potent greenhouse gas has begun seeping out of the Antarctic seafloor in dozens of places, scientists have discovered. Researchers documented the emergence of these methane seeps in shallow regions of the Ross Sea, a bay off the southern coast of Antarctica. The patches of leaking gas could be caused by global warming, and they could also threaten to accelerate it further, according to a new study published Oct. 1 in the journal Nature Communications . ""Every time we discover or hear of a new one, we feel immediate excitement, but that excitement is quickly replaced with anxiety and concern about what it all means,"" study lead author Sarah Seabrook , a marine scientist at the research institute Earth Sciences New Zealand, said in a statement . ""If they follow the behaviour of other global seep systems, there is the potential for rapid transfer of methane to the atmosphere from a source that is not currently factored into future climate change scenarios,"" Seabrook added. Methane (CH 4 ) is a greenhouse gas that traps heat in the atmosphere by absorbing outgoing radiation. When methane first enters the atmosphere, it is a lot more effective at trapping heat than carbon dioxide (CO 2 ), being about 80 times more potent across the first 20 years it's in the atmosphere. This makes methane a particularly aggressive short-term driver of climate change. (CO 2 stays in the atmosphere for longer, so it's a more significant long-term driver.) About 60% of methane emissions come from human activities such as farming and burning fossil fuels, while the remaining 40% come from natural sources. Scientists are concerned that as the planet gets warmer, more natural methane and carbon dioxide sources, such as those in melting permafrost , are being unlocked, creating a positive feedback loop that accelerates warming even further. Researchers have previously spotted tens of thousands of methane leaks in the Arctic, but prior to the new study, there was only one confirmed Antarctic methane seep, identified in 2011 . Underwater seeps create streams of bubbles as methane and other chemicals dissolve in ocean water following their release from beneath the seabed. White mats of microbial communities live around seeps, making them identifiable on the seafloor. Get the world’s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox. Sarah Seabrook cut holes in the ice with a chainsaw to access the ocean beneath. (Image credit: Leigh Tait - Earth Sciences NZ) In the new study, researchers used acoustic surveys, divers and a remotely operated vehicle to explore seeps located between 16 feet (5 meters) and 787 feet (240 m) below the icy surface of the Ross Sea, off the Antarctic mainland. The team initially only went to investigate one seep in Cape Evans, located on the west side of Ross Island, and were surprised to find the seafloor littered with them. ""Last year, we went to Cape Evans to look at one small area where gas bubbles had been discovered and were hoping to find that one site still bubbling,"" Seabrook said. ""Instead, we found dozens more."" The researchers studied areas that have been regularly surveyed for decades, meaning that the seeps must be a new feature. It's not known exactly what is causing the seeps to appear, but the researchers noted that similar processes in the Arctic and paleorecord (past environments) have been attributed to climate-driven cryospheric change — the degradation of Earth's ice that previously locked these chemicals in place. It's unclear how much methane might be leaving Antarctica and reaching our atmosphere, nor how much remains trapped beneath its thawing ice, but the researchers are concerned that the seeps could be widespread. This raises fears of positive feedback loops as well as a variety of other knock-on effects caused by methane, such as ocean acidification. Seabrook and her colleagues recommended coordinated, international efforts to urgently study the seeps. ""If these seeps keep emerging at the areas we are working in, it really begs the question of what the shallow coastal environment of Antarctica may look like five or 10 years from now,"" Seabrook said. ""This system is rapidly changing before our eyes from one year to the next.""",https://www.livescience.com/planet-earth/antarctica/methane-leaks-multiplying-beneath-antarctic-ocean-spark-fears-of-climate-doom-loop,Science,livescience.com,,https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ecY9uhU4kQq7MUEha6u8cd-2546-80.png,2025-10-15T13:00:42+00:00,19ad7a6b410a14a0c13db859a31247776b6f781e
a5ce244ec206,We were wrong about how the moon's largest and oldest crater formed — and that's great news for NASA's next lunar landing,,"The largest and oldest crater on the moon did not form as we initially suspected, a new study suggests. The findings hint that a specific region of the lunar surface could be more scientifically interesting than we thought — with big implications for NASA 's upcoming Artemis missions , which are scheduled to land astronauts within this newly realized area of interest as soon as 2027. The moon formed around 4.46 billion years ago , when an ancient Mars-size protoplanet, known as Theia, collided with Earth, creating a giant cloud of debris that combined into a large spherical satellite orbiting our planet. For the next 200 million years or so, the lunar surface was covered by a hellish magma ocean , as a result of gravitational squeezing from Earth. But as the moon moved farther away from our planet, the molten rock eventually cooled and crystalized, forming an outer rocky crust that has remained largely unchanged ever since — aside from a near-constant bombardment of space rocks . Shortly after the moon cooled off, around 4.3 billion years ago, an asteroid more than 10 times wider than the one that wiped out the dinosaurs slammed into what is now the satellite's permanent far side . This birthed the South Pole-Aitken (SPA) basin , a giant impact crater around 1,550 miles (2,500 kilometers) across and up to 5 miles (8 km) deep. Researchers believe that this extreme impact may have ejected a mix of radioactive material, dubbed ""potassium, rare earth elements and phosphorus"" or KREEP, that was left over from the past magma ocean. (The chemical symbol for potassium is K, hence the name KREEP.) KREEP is believed to have formed during the final cooling phase of the moon , when radioactive elements built up in the space between the moon's newly formed mantle and crust. Studying these elements more closely could help shed light on several mysteries surrounding this period of lunar evolution, including why the crust on the moon's far side is thicker than its visible near side . Until now, researchers believed that the SPA basin was formed by an asteroid impacting the moon from the south, which would have splashed a layer of KREEP around the crater's northern rim. However, in a new study, published Oct. 8 in the journal Nature , researchers found that the impact actually occurred from the north, meaning that the resulting KREEP is plastered around the southern edge of the crater — right where the crewed Artemis III mission is scheduled to land. This photo, taken by the Apollo 8 astronauts in December 1968, shows the lunar mountains surrounding the northern rim of the South Pole-Aitken basin. (Image credit: NASA) ""This means that the Artemis missions will be landing on the down-range rim of the basin — the best place to study the largest and oldest impact basin on the moon,"" study lead author Jeffrey Andrews-Hanna , a planetary scientist at the University of Arizona, said in a statement . This is ""where most of the ejecta, material from deep within the moon's interior, should be piled up,"" he added. The researchers became suspicious of the SPA basin's true origins when they compared its shape to other impact craters in the solar system , including Mars' Hellas basin and Pluto's Sputnik basin. All three craters have a similar shape, with one rounded end and another more pointed, making them look somewhat like an avocado or teardrop. The pointed tip of these craters likely represents the direction of impact, enabling researchers to guess which way the SPA basin asteroid hit. Get the world’s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox. These suspicions were confirmed when the team analyzed data from the Lunar Prospector, a NASA spacecraft that orbited the moon from 1998 to 1999 and measured the radioactivity of surface elements. This revealed a high concentration of thorium — a radioactive element and key component of KREEP — around the crater's southwestern rim. Collecting KREEP-y samples The uncrewed Orion capsule of the Artemis I mission circled the moon for around two weeks in late 2022. (Image credit: NASA) The Artemis III mission, which aims to put humans on the moon for the first time since 1972, is currently scheduled for mid-2027, following the completion of the Artemis II mission, which is due to launch at some point before the end of April 2026. The initial mission will send a crewed spacecraft to orbit the moon, similar to the uncrewed Artemis I spacecraft, which successfully circled the moon in late 2022 . The Artemis III astronauts will land near the moon's south pole in one of nine potential sites, most of which lie inside the KREEP splash zone surrounding SPA, according to NASA . If they land in the right place, this could give the team the chance to collect valuable KREEP samples. However, there is some uncertainty about when Artemis III will actually launch. Both Artemis II and Artemis III have already been delayed several times . Historically high cuts proposed to NASA's 2026 budget have also led some experts to predict further delays, which may end up handing China the advantage in the race to return humans to the moon. China has also already acquired the first samples of the moon's far side, which were returned to Earth in June 2024 by the Chang'e 6 spacecraft, from inside the SPA basin. However, despite sharing the valuable lunar rocks with several other countries, NASA has not yet been allowed to anlayze these samples .

1074b239dba1,Diagnostic dilemma: A woman's nausea was triggered by a huge mass in her stomach — which doctors dissolved with diet soda,,"The patient: A 63-year-old woman in Massachusetts The symptoms: The patient went to the emergency department after experiencing nausea and vomiting for about a month, along with decreased appetite. She told doctors that she'd also experienced a burning pain in her upper abdomen and right side of her torso, which wrapped around to her back. She'd tried treating these symptoms with two common over-the-counter medications for acid reflux, but the treatments didn't help. In the year prior, the patient had started taking semaglutide, a type of drug known as a GLP-1 receptor agonist — the same class of drug as Ozempic. These injected drugs are used to treat type 2 diabetes and assist in chronic weight management; in this case, the woman had a history of type 2 diabetes and obesity. Since starting the medication, she'd lost about 40 pounds (18 kilograms), but notably, that weight loss had accelerated over the previous month, she noted. What happened next: Doctors took a CT scan of the patient's abdomen and pelvis. This revealed that the bile ducts, which move bile from the liver to the gallbladder and small intestine, were slightly dilated. The woman also had ""heavy stool burden"" but no signs of obstructions in her bowels, and her stomach was slightly stretched out due to carrying ""semisolid material."" To take a closer look, the medical team then used magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography, a noninvasive scan that examines the bile ducts, gallbladder, pancreas and pancreatic ducts. The scan confirmed that the bile ducts were dilated and revealed a mass in the stomach that appeared to be trapped air. The doctors then examined the upper digestive tract, from the esophagus to the top of the small intestine, with an endoscope. The diagnosis: The endoscopy revealed a large mass in the woman's stomach, known as a gastric bezoar . These masses are tightly packed blobs of partially digested or undigested materials. The treatment: Semaglutide and other GLP-1 agonists typically cause delayed gastric emptying, which means they slow the rate at which the stomach empties its contents into the intestines. The woman was taken off that medication upon hospital admission. Get the world’s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox. The next step with a bezoar is to try and dissolve the mass while it's still in the stomach — and evidence suggests a good way to do this is to give the patient soda. ""Existing evidence, largely from case series and anecdotal experiences, supports the administration of 3 liters [0.8 gallons] of cola, either orally or through a nasogastric tube, within a 12-hour window,"" doctors noted in a report of the case . ""It is not well understood whether acidity, carbonation , or another mechanism accounts for dissolution of the bezoar."" Due to the patient's history of diabetes, she was given diet cola. She also didn't enjoy carbonated beverages, so the typical prescription of 3 liters of soda was cut down to 1.5 liters (0.4 gallons). On the second day after starting this treatment, the patient noted a ""tugging"" sensation in her abdomen followed by relief of her nausea and abdominal discomfort. An endoscopic exam revealed that the bezoar was no longer stuck in her stomach. The woman then transitioned to a typical diet in the hospital, and by the time she was discharged, she had no nausea, vomiting or abdominal pain. She did not restart semaglutide but was prescribed acid reflux medication to take daily. She reported that her appetite increased after hospital discharge and her weight rebounded a bit over the following months. Her abdominal symptoms had not returned within a few months of discharge. What makes the case unique: Gastric bezoars are fairly rare, the report noted. They are found in less than 0.5% of endoscopies of the upper digestive tract. Common symptoms of the condition, such as pain, nausea, vomiting and abdominal discomfort, also appear in many more-common disorders, so they don't necessarily point to the presence of a bezoar in all cases. The most common type of gastric bezoar is formed of plant fibers and called a ""phytobezoar."" Eating lots of certain foods, such as persimmons, pineapples, raisins or celery, can raise the risk of phytobezoars because the plants contain a high concentration of indigestible components, such as cellulose, lignins and certain tannins. However, various medical conditions, procedures and drugs can also raise the risk of bezoars. These include anatomical changes related to bariatric or other gastric surgeries, autonomic nerve damage, and medications that cause delayed gastric emptying, such as GLP-1s. In the woman's case, semaglutide was likely to blame for her bezoar, and discontinuing the treatment helped resolve the problem. The cola she consumed also helped. Although that course of treatment sounds strange on paper, it is the preferred first-line treatment over using a scope to physically break up the bezoar in the patient's stomach. ""Bezoars formed from food material may be initially managed with oral administration of cola in patients in a clinically stable condition,"" the report said. ""This intervention is generally cost-effective and is associated with a lower risk of complications than invasive procedures.""

ed6e22df6362,"The viral 'Chicago Rat Hole' wasn't actually made by a rat, scientists claim",,"A rat-shaped indent on a Chicago sidewalk went viral early last year, with troves of people venturing to the hole bearing coins and other offerings. However, a new study suggests the so-called ""Chicago Rat Hole"" wasn't actually made by a rat — it was probably the imprint of a squirrel. By comparing characteristics of the hole with information about the local rodent populations, researchers determined that a squirrel most likely made the impression. The study was published Wednesday (Oct. 15) in the journal Biology Letters . ""Just like everyone else, I looked at it like, 'Yep, that's a rat,'"" study lead author Michael Granatosky , an evolutionary biomechanist at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville, told Live Science. ""But just assuming something is not the best way to actually do science."" The hole, a well-preserved imprint of a rodent's death in wet concrete, was around for decades before it went viral. It became a tourist attraction in 2024 after the Chicago-based artist and comedian Winslow Dumaine posted about its existence on the social platform X. ""Squirrels are a lot more TV-ready than rats are,"" Dumaine told Live Science. ""But I do think the fact it was dubbed a rat hole was a key part in why it became popular."" As the researchers came across pictures of the hole on social media, some felt it didn't look ""super rat-like,"" senior study author Edwin Dickinson , an archaeologist at the University of Calgary, told Live Science. It also seemed unlikely a rat could have made such a cast on wet concrete without also leaving footprints leading up to it. These suspicions drove researchers to analyze the hole more deeply. Using the citizen science app iNaturalist, which catalogues local fauna, the study authors identified possible animals that could have made the hole. They knew, from the indent, that it had to be an animal with four legs, five-clawed feet and a tail. Get the world’s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox. Then, it was all a matter of proportion. The study authors didn't have a chance to measure the hole itself, which city officials removed in April 2024, citing the disturbance crowds were bringing to the Roscoe Village neighborhood. However, they were able to get precise measurements thanks to the many pictures people had posted of the imprint alongside coins and other items. The researchers compared their measurements to specimens at the American Museum of Natural History. A statistical analysis of this data showed a 98.7% likelihood the hole was made by either an eastern grey squirrel ( Sciurus carolinensis ) or a fox squirrel ( Sciurus niger ) . In light of this finding, the scientists suggested rechristening the rat hole as the ""Windy City Sidewalk Squirrel"" to better represent its origins. The authors hope the study will help people see the fun in science. ""The rat hole might be the medium, but the idea that we're hoping to perpetuate in this study is… there's nothing too inherently complicated or scary about following the scientific method,"" Dickinson said.

(Image credit: Wim van den Heever (South Africa)/ Wildlife Photographer of the Year ) An eerie image of a brown hyena ( Parahyaena brunnea ) prowling the ruins of an abandoned diamond mining town in Namibia has won this year's Wildlife Photographer of the Year competition. The haunting scene, titled 'Ghost Town Visitor,' shows the world's rarest hyena standing in front of a long-deserted building lit with an ethereal glow. To capture it, photographer Wim Van den Heever set up camera traps in the ghost town of Kolmanskop after discovering hyena tracks there nearly a decade ago. ""I spent several seasons trying to photograph them at dawn and dusk from nearby buildings, but without success,"" van den Heever told Live Science in an email. ""Eventually, I turned to camera traps, carefully positioning them where hyenas might pass. After nearly a decade of patience and persistence, I finally captured the image — a brown hyena wandering through the silent ruins."" Brown hyenas, also known as strandwolves , are identified by their shaggy brown coats, pointed ears and distinctive manes. Their global population is estimated to be as few as 4,000 individuals , which are primarily found in the arid regions of Namibia, Botswana and parts of South Africa. Brown hyenas are known to pass through Kolmanskop while travelling to hunt for Cape fur seal pups or scavenge for carrion washed ashore along the Namib Desert coast, according to a statement released by the competition organizers. ""For years, I'd noticed brown hyena tracks and droppings in the ghost town of Kolmanskop near Lüderitz, and I knew they roamed its eerie, sand-filled streets,"" van den Heever said. ""It became my dream to capture one moving through this haunting, abandoned place."" The photograph was also awarded first place in the Urban Wildlife category. ""You get a prickly feeling just looking at this image and you know that you're in this hyena's realm, "" Kathy Moran , Chair of the Wildlife Photographer of the Year Jury said in the statement. ""I also love the twist on this interpretation of 'urban' — it was once but is no longer a human-dominated environment.""

(Image credit: Qingrong Yang (China)/ Wildlife Photographer of the Year ) In a perfectly timed shot, photographer Qingrong Yang captured the moment a ladyfish ( Elops saurus ) snatched its prey beneath the swooping body of a little egret ( Egretta garzetta ) at Yundang Lake. Once a stagnant, polluted port in China , the lake has been transformed into a thriving ecosystem thanks to an engineering project reconnecting it to the sea. The stunning photograph took the top prize in the Birds category. Dennis Stogsdill (USA) witnesses a caracal hunting a lesser flamingo in the Serengeti National Park, Tanzania. (Image credit: Dennis Stogsdill (USA)/ Wildlife Photographer of the Year ) This captivating image of a lesser flamingo ( Phoeniconaias minor ) in the jaws of a predatory wildcat known as a caracal ( Caracal caracal ) at the Serengeti National Park in Tanzania, won the Mammal Behavior category. ""The story of this image is one of unplanned luck,"" photographer Dennis Stogsdill told Live Science in an email. ""We had received a call of a serval [ Leptailurus serval ] near the lake and we rushed over to view only because a friend wanted to see one."" But when Stogsdill arrived at the scene, he was met by a caracal instead. ""Just moments later it began to stalk the flamingoes,"" he said. ""So, while most wildlife photography involves immense patience and planning this was about as lucky as one can get."" Caracals are primarily nocturnal, meaning that seeing one hunting flamingoes in broad daylight is exceptionally rare — a behavior that has likely never been captured before, Stogsdill added.

640208bcb0a4,Astronomers spot the most powerful and distant 'odd radio circle' ever seen,,"With help from citizen scientists, astronomers have spotted the most powerful ""odd radio circle"" (ORC) yet. The discovery could give astronomers a better understanding of how these unusual objects — and the galaxies they encircle — form. ""ORCs are among the most bizarre and beautiful cosmic structures we've ever seen — and they may hold vital clues about how galaxies and black holes co-evolve, hand in hand,"" Ananda Hota , founder of the RAD@home Astronomy Collaboratory and co-author of a new paper describing the findings, said in a statement . ORCs were first described in 2019 by a team using the Australian Square Kilometer Array Pathfinder. They are essentially gigantic, faint rings of plasma that appear to surround certain galaxies and emit radio waves . To date, only around a dozen of these enormous objects — most of which are 10 to 20 times the size of the Milky Way — have been found. But researchers think the newly discovered ORC may offer some clues about how these cosmic behemoths form. This ORC is unique for a couple of reasons. First, it is made of not just one, but two rings interlocked like a Venn diagram. This is only the second time astronomers have observed such a configuration. Second, it is the most distant and powerful ORC found to date. Researchers detailed their findings in a paper published Oct. 2 in the journal Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society . The new rings were first flagged by citizen scientists taking part in the RAD@home Astronomy Collaboratory, an international citizen science research platform originally founded in India. The rings were then confirmed by a team of astronomers using the Low-Frequency Array (LOFAR), a series of radio telescopes spread across mainland Europe, and dubbed RAD J131346.9+500320. ""The fact that citizen scientists uncovered them highlights the continued importance of human pattern recognition, even in the age of machine learning,"" Pratik Dabhade , an astronomer at the National Center for Nuclear Research in Poland and co-author of the new paper, said in the statement. Previous research suggested that ORCs could form when supermassive black holes crash into one another, sending out cosmic shock waves. But RAD J131346.9+500320's twin rings center around a jet-like filament of gas. Based on this structure, Dabhade and his team propose that it may have been shaped by ""super winds"" flowing from the spiral galaxies it contains. This may hold true for other ORCs as well, though more research is needed to say for sure. Get the world’s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox. In addition to RAD J131346.9+500320, the paper details two other objects found in collaboration with the RAD@home Astronomy Collaboratory: a galaxy 3 million light-years across that's surrounded by a radio ring, and another galaxy with a ring around one of its massive jets.

Rubin Observatory in Chile, may help reveal more about these structures.",https://www.livescience.com/space/astronomy/astronomers-spot-the-most-powerful-and-distant-odd-radio-circle-ever-seen,Science,livescience.com,,https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jSmvbNZeqKcTjbDv39DKLD-1920-80.jpg,2025-10-14T16:59:50+00:00,28ab682c1abefc5141c057d321cb460963072340
762d1ab5c8cd,"A massive weak spot in Earth's magnetic field is growing, scientists discover",,"A weak spot in Earth's magnetic field over the South Atlantic Ocean has ballooned in size since 2014, satellite data reveals. The region, known as the South Atlantic Anomaly, has grown by an area nearly half the size of continental Europe, sprouting a lobe in the direction of Africa where the field is weakening the fastest. And the anomaly, linked to mysterious fluctuations near Earth's outer core, could pose a risk to satellites passing over the region, according to a study published in the November issue of the journal Physics of the Earth and Planetary Interiors . ""The South Atlantic Anomaly is not just a single block,"" study lead author Chris Finlay , a professor of geomagnetism at the Technical University of Denmark, said in a statement . ""It's changing differently towards Africa than it is near South America. There's something special happening in this region that is causing the field to weaken in a more intense way."" Researchers first detected the South Atlantic Anomaly in the 19th century. Inside its boundaries, the magnetic field that radiates away from Earth's interior dips down to an altitude of about 120 miles (200 kilometers) above the planet's surface, which is much lower than the field's average altitude of about 400 miles (650 km) . This poses a threat to satellites and other spacecraft. Earth's magnetic field shields the planet and objects in low Earth orbit from charged solar particles and incoming X-ray and ultraviolet radiation, so spacecraft traveling over the South Atlantic Anomaly are exposed to more of these impacts. This could lead to malfunctions or damage in hardware, and even blackouts, according to the statement. Finlay and his colleagues think the South Atlantic Anomaly is growing and spreading eastward due to strange fluxes at the limit between Earth's mantle and outer core, the layers of the planet sandwiched between Earth's crust and inner core. Get the world’s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox. Earth's magnetic field is largely generated by the planet's liquid outer core. (Image credit: Mopic/Shutterstock) Earth's magnetic field is largely generated by Earth's outer core — an ocean of swirling, molten iron located roughly 1,900 miles (3,000 km) beneath the planet's surface. The liquid iron dynamo generates electrical currents, and their flow induces a magnetic field that spreads up into the mantle and extends through Earth's atmosphere, forming two giant rings that join near the poles. Scientists previously found that in some areas beneath the South Atlantic Anomaly, the magnetism generated by the outer core is looping back into the core instead of coming out. These patterns, known as reverse flux patches, can migrate and expand, explaining the growth of the South Atlantic Anomaly over the past 11 years, Finlay said. “We can see one of these areas moving westward over Africa, which contributes to the weakening of the South Atlantic Anomaly [the magnetic field] in this region,"" he added. Two areas where Earth's magnetic field is particularly strong, Canada and Siberia, have experienced changes over the past decade. (Image credit: ESA (Data source: Finlay, C.C. et al., 2025)) The scientists spotted the unusual shifts in data from the European Space Agency ’s (ESA's) ongoing Swarm mission, which uses three identical satellites to measure magnetic signals originating from Earth's interior and oceans. The data also revealed changes in magnetic field dynamics above Canada and Siberia, where magnetism has appeared more intense than average since Swarm began its observations in 2013. Since 2014, the magnetic field above Canada has weakened slightly, and the magnetic field above Siberia has strengthened, the new study shows. The strong region over Canada has shrunk by an area nearly the size of India, while the strong region over Siberia has grown by an area the size of Greenland. The researchers attributed these changes to a shift in Earth's northern magnetic pole in Siberia's direction over recent years, but more monitoring is needed to see how the dynamics evolve. ""It's really wonderful to see the big picture of our dynamic Earth,"" Anja Strømme , ESA's Swarm mission manager, said in the statement. ""The satellites are all healthy and providing excellent data, so we can hopefully extend that record beyond 2030.""",https://www.livescience.com/planet-earth/a-massive-weak-spot-in-earths-magnetic-field-is-growing-scientists-discover,Science,livescience.com,,https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/RUa9Ks48jG5dLXP5xkUSUV-1280-80.png,2025-10-14T14:11:35+00:00,9efe4da2f59bfa131435c4144596ce03a22d4571

371401254e9c,New hydrogen battery can operate four times colder than before — meaning denser and longer-lasting EV batteries,,"Future electric cars could ditch lithium-ion batteries , thanks to a new breakthrough in hydrogen energy storage at much lower temperatures than was previously possible. Researchers from Tokyo’s Institute of Science created a hydrogen battery that uses magnesium hydride as the anode and hydrogen gas as the cathode, and a solid-state electrolyte with a crystal structure. In a study published Sept. 18 in the journal Science , the scientists noted that this battery can operate at 194 degrees F (90 degrees C), rather than the 572-752 F (300-400 degrees C) operating temperatures needed for current solid-state hydrogen storage methods. ""These properties of our hydrogen storage battery were previously unattainable through conventional thermal methods or liquid electrolytes, offering a foundation for efficient hydrogen storage systems suitable for use as energy carriers,"" said lead author of the study Takashi Hirose , associate professor in Kyoto University's Institute of Chemical Research (ICR), in a statement . Hydrogen batteries with solid-state components already exist, as do hydrogen fuel cells. The former, however, require high operating temperatures while the latter struggle to be as efficient as lithium-ion batteries, as well as struggling to store hydrogen gas under high pressure. But with this new hydrogen battery, the scientists achieved full theoretical storage capacity of the MgH 2 anode and high ionic conductivity at room temperature. Solid foundation The core of this hydrogen battery lies in its solid electrolyte. Formed of barium, calcium and sodium hydride, the electrolyte has a crystal-like structure that offers both high electrochemical stability and high ionic conductivity, specifically when it comes to hydrogen ions, at relatively low temperatures. In operation, the battery functions much like a lithium-ion one, except that rather than positively charged ions moving through the electrolyte, this new battery uses hydride ions that carry a negative charge and can pass through its crystal structure. Get the world’s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox. When delivering power (discharging), the hydrogen gas in the cathode goes through a chemical reaction that reduces it to hydride ions that move through the electrolyte to the magnesium anode, where they oxidise to form MgH 2 . In this state, oxidation-reduction reactions (redox) take place, causing the negatively charged anode to lose electrons. These flow across an external circuit to the cathode, which now has a net positive charge — and in doing so, delivers power to connected devices or systems. The reverse happens when charging, with an external power source invoking redox. Here, the MgH 2 anode releases hydride ions that pass through the electrode to then be oxidised at the hydrogen electrode to form hydrogen gas. As such, electrons flow from the H 2 electrode to the Mg one until the reduction reaction can no longer occur, meaning the battery is in a fully charged state. With this battery design, hydrogen gas can be stored and released in a solid-state cell on demand, with a capacity of 2,030mAh per gram (for reference, lithium-ion batteries tend to have a cpacitiy of 154 to 203mAh per gram , while some of the best phones have lithium-ion battery capacities of 5,000mAh for the whole cell). While the operating temperature sits just below the boiling point of water, meaning such a battery isn’t ready for use in everyday electronic items like smartphones or laptops, there’s scope for it to pave the way for more efficient and easier hydrogen storage. This, in turn, could see electric vehicles adopt hydrogen batteries rather than lithium-ion batteries, which are heavy and suffer from degradation as well as declining efficiency over their lifetime. Better hydrogen storage without the need for high-pressure systems, extreme cooling or high operating temperatures could further open up hydrogen’s use as a green power source. That's because it could offer less of a carbon footprint than fossil fuels and current hydrogen-based power systems. Hydrogen has often been touted as one of the ways to transition towards green energy, although its production, storage and use in power delivery systems has remained a niche activity. If scaled up and put into production, this battery breakthrough could continue to propel hydrogen as a fuel of the future.",https://www.livescience.com/technology/electric-vehicles/new-hydrogen-battery-can-operate-four-times-colder-than-before-meaning-denser-and-longer-lasting-ev-batteries,Science,livescience.com,,https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jqVhjhSdjZHnA3T8ZmC98Z-1600-80.jpg,2025-10-14T11:30:00+00:00,a4ed268e0666592bfe5ddcc9f2302fbd1a20153c

Yarlung Zangbo River, Tibet Autonomous Region of China [ 29.2814054, 91.3256581 ] What's in the photo? The braided branches of a river winding through the Tibetan Plateau Which satellite took the photo? Landsat 9 When was it taken? Feb. 8, 2025 This striking satellite photo shows a particularly convoluted section of a record-breaking ""braided river"" in China , which drastically changes shape every year and could become more unstable over the coming decades due to climate change. The Yarlung Zangbo River is a roughly 1,250-mile-long (2,000 kilometers) waterway that stretches from its origin at a glacier in the eastern Tibetan Plateau all the way into India. It is the longest river in Tibet, as well as the fifth longest in China, and holds the record for being the highest major river on Earth, flowing at an average elevation of 4,000 meters (13,000 feet) above sea level, according to NASA's Earth Observatory . The photographed section of the river is located in Zhanang County, just before it passes through the world's deepest land-based canyon and its namesake, the Yarlung Tsangpo Grand Canyon , which is more than 6,000 meters (20,000 feet) deep — or three times deeper than Arizona's Grand Canyon. Yarlung Zangbo is a classic example of a braided river — a waterway with ""multi-threaded channels that branch and merge to create the characteristic braided pattern,"" with mid-channel sandbars that are ""formed, consumed, and re-formed continuously,"" according to the National Park Service . This section is where the most braiding occurs anywhere along the river, with up to 20 channels across at certain points in the image. Related: See all the best images of Earth from space Yarlung Zangbo is one of the best examples of a braided river anywhere on Earth. Its channels shift so frequently that nothing can grow on its temporary sandbars. (Image credit: VCG/VCG via Getty Images) Yarlang Zangbo's extreme braiding is caused by heavy sediment deposits from the steep slopes of the adjacent Himalayas, which are washed into the river and help carve new channels into the ground, Zoltán Sylvester , a geologist at the University of Texas at Austin, told the Earth Observatory. The river changes shape so often that no vegetation can fully grow on the sandbars that sporadically appear between the river's braids, he added.

You can see how quickly the river changes shape for yourself in a 37-year timelapse animation, which shows annual satellite images of this spot taken between 1988 to 2025 by Landsat 5, Landsat 8 and Landsat 9 (see below). Eagle-eyed viewers may also be able to spot a narrow bridge, which was constructed over the shapeshifting waterway in 2014. (It's visible as a thin line near the far right-hand side of the animation). Satellite images captured between 1988 and 2025 show how the river's many channels change shape on a yearly basis. (Image credit: NASA/Landsat mission) The river starts at the Angsi Glacier, emerging from a stream of meltwater that flows from the ice mass. However, this was only officially confirmed in 2011, according to Chinese state media . Before this, there was confusion among scientists about whether the river actually originated from a meltwater stream coming from the nearby Chemayungdung Glacier. Like many other Himalayan ice masses , the Angsi Glacier has lost a significant amount of water in recent decades due to human-caused climate change. The resulting meltwater has caused more sediment to be deposited into the river, which can increase erosion and make it more likely for its banks to collapse. According to a 2024 study that analyzed satellite photos of the 13 major rivers in the Tibetan Plateau, this poses a risk to local ecosystems, infrastructure and landscape stability. When the river eventually reaches India, it becomes part of the Brahmaputra River and continues for another 1,800 miles (2,900 km) until it reaches the Ganges River Delta, where it drains into the Indian Ocean, according to the Earth Observatory.",https://www.livescience.com/planet-earth/rivers-oceans/shapeshifting-braided-river-in-tibet-is-the-highest-in-the-world-and-is-becoming-increasingly-unstable-earth-from-space,Science,livescience.com,,https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/a5K2qGJpJzLpDRpcmfb8SB-1600-80.jpg,2025-10-14T07:00:00+00:00,d934551b0199f43c76ef2d6fb4e1dca168903259
b5613dcb9ffc,Mysterious chunks of DNA called 'inocles' could be hiding in your mouth,,"Scientists have discovered huge, mysterious pieces of DNA in the oral microbiome — the population of bacteria and other microbes living in our mouths — and they say this giant DNA might influence the human immune system. It's well known that we have plenty of bacteria in our mouths and that these microbes can have both positive and negative impacts on our oral and overall health. Now, in a study published Aug. 11 in the journal Nature Communications , researchers report a previously undiscovered feature of the oral microbiome: giant pieces of bacterial DNA that separate from the microbes' main genome. Moreover, these pieces of DNA are associated with changes in the body's immune system and even the occurrence of certain types of cancer, the team found. The study provides a ""new puzzle piece that is a step in understanding the oral microbiome, human health, and human disease,"" Floyd Dewhirst , a professor at the ADA Forsyth Institute who was not involved in the research, told Live Science in an email. Microbiome studies , which have flourished in the past decade, have shown that the microbiomes across the body play major roles in human health and disease. Researchers have identified the types and proportions of different microbial species that live in places like our mouths and guts , and then used that data to see how differences in those features are linked to our health. Over the years, the genomes of these species have been studied extensively but conventional genetic analyses have not yet been able to explain all of the links between our microbiome and overall health status. Researchers in the Yutaka Suzuki lab at the University of Tokyo wanted to explore these missing data and were inspired by the recent discovery of giant extrachromosomal elements (ECEs) in bacteria living in soil. ECEs are pieces of DNA that are separate from an organism's main genome. In humans, our mitochondrial DNA — stored in the powerhouses of our cells — is an ECE. In bacteria, a commonly known small ECE is called a plasmid. Get the world’s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox. Lead study author Yuya Kiguchi , who is now a researcher at Stanford University, and his colleagues in the Suzuki lab predicted that giant ECEs could be found in bacteria living in places other than soil. ""Maybe many of these giant extra chromosomal elements are found in the environment, the microbiome field, or pathogens,"" Kiguchi told Live Science. ""But we don't know any examples of this kind of giant extra chromosomal element from the commensal [human] microbiome."" Commensal microbes are those that live symbiotically in or on the human body. Using saliva samples from hundreds of people, the researchers found, for the first time, that giant ECEs also exist in our oral microbiome. The research team named these giant pieces of DNA ""inocles;"" the name stands for "" in sertion sequence encoded; o ral origin; cir cle genomic structure."" They also found that approximately 74% of people in their study possessed these inocles in their oral microbiome. So why is this the first time inocles have been discovered? Most genetic experiments in bacteria use short-read DNA sequencing methods. This involves cutting a cell's DNA into smaller pieces, reading their code, and then assembling the bits into a full genome using a computer. While this method of sequencing can easily detect small ECEs, like typical bacterial plasmids, inocles are too large and complex for short-read sequencing to spot. Using long-read DNA sequencing — a costlier and more time consuming method in which much larger pieces of DNA are sequenced and stitched together — the scientists could identify these large chunks of extrachromosomal DNA in the bacteria of human saliva samples. By correlating those results with blood samples from the same people, they also found that differences in the levels of inocles is associated with differences in the immune system, including the immune response to certain bacterial and viral infections. Sixty-eight people in the study had either a type of head and neck or colorectal cancer, and these individuals had lower levels of inocles in their oral microbiomes compared with the people without these cancers. That raises the possibility of using these newly discovered giant chunks of DNA as future biomarkers for cancer, the study authors suggested. As a next step, the researchers aim to grow these inocles in the lab so they can further investigate their function and how they can spread between bacteria and people. ""Now that we know that inocles exist, we can try and figure out their functions and potential roles in health and disease,"" Dewhirst said.",https://www.livescience.com/health/mysterious-chunks-of-dna-called-inocles-could-be-hiding-in-your-mouth,Science,livescience.com,,https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/wsQXhZ8zqgk9wBjQjgfW6K-1920-80.jpg,2025-10-13T17:00:00+00:00,89d48f8cc7dee1387585214c6dcd9c40b434e6b7
99d07ea7a42b,Link between Cascadia and San Andreas Fault earthquakes discovered 30 years after lost vessel stumbled across key data,,"A ""Big One"" on the Cascadia subduction zone in the Pacific Northwest might trigger a similarly serious earthquake on California's San Andreas Fault , new research suggests. The findings are based on sediments taken from the seabed off the coast of Cape Mendocino, California and offshore Oregon. It's at Cape Mendocino that California's famous San Andreas fault ends and the Cascadia subduction zone begins. These are two very different fault systems, but the sediment record suggests that in the past, at least three San Andreas earthquakes have happened within hours to a couple of days after large Cascadia quakes. Another seven or so may have occurred within decades to years or less. There are uncertainties in the dating and records, however. But if the two fault systems are, in fact, synchronized, it could be a real problem for disaster relief, said study first author Chris Goldfinger , a paleoseismologist and professor emeritus at Oregon State University. ""Having these things side by side would really be a tough one,"" Goldfinger told Live Science. ""There'd be not enough resources to respond to even one of these very well, and two of them would be really difficult."" Earthquake potential Cascadia can create extremely powerful earthquakes. Famously, in 1700, the region experienced a quake thought to be between magnitude 8.7 and 9.2 that sent destructive tsunami waves all the way to Japan. These quakes are caused by movement of three oceanic plates (the Explorer, the Juan de Fuca, and the Gorda) slipping beneath the North American continent. The San Andreas Fault, on the other hand, is a strike-slip fault where rock masses on either side of the fault move past each other horizontally.. The largest known quake on the northern San Andreas was the 1906 San Francisco earthquake of approximately magnitude 7.9. Because the fault runs through densely populated areas, it could do a great deal of damage, as in the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake that killed 63 people. Get the world’s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox. The two fault systems meet off the coast of Mendocino in an area known as the ""triple junction."" Goldfinger and his colleagues were on a research cruise in 1999 drilling core samples from the ocean floor in Cascadia, looking for signs of ancient earthquakes. When large earthquakes happen on land, they can trigger underwater flows of sand and sediment known as turbidites. Turbidites follow a pattern where coarse sediment settles out of the water first, creating a layer. Finer sands and silt follow, forming another layer. On that cruise, however, a mix-up led to the ship traveling 60 miles from where they'd meant to be. The scientists, who were trying to nap between working, didn't realize the error until the ship arrived. ""I was just like, 'Oh no, we’re like halfway to San Francisco,'"" Goldfinger remembers. He decided to take a core sample in that spot anyway. When the team later analyzed the sample, they realized it contained a mystery. The turbidites in the sample didn't have the coarse layer on the bottom and the finer layer on top, as was typical. ""This original core of the San Andreas had deposits that looked like they were upside-down,"" Goldfinger said. ""The sand was at the top."" Upside-down evidence The researchers had no explanation for this flip-flopped pattern. Nor, at first, did they have an explanation for another strange mystery of these offshore samples: Cores taken south of the triple junction, in the realm of the northern San Andreas, seemed to show earthquakes that matched eerily well to the timing of earthquakes taken north of the triple junction in Cascadia. In the last 1,300 years, they found, there were 18 likely earthquake-generated turbidites in Cascadia and 19 offshore from the northern San Andreas. Ten of those appeared to be deposited within 50 to 100 years of each other. Core samples indicate that at least three earthquakes at the Cascadia subduction zone were followed by events at the San Andreas Fault within just hours or days. (Image credit: Chris Goldfinger) Even weirder, in three cases, the coarse sand of the upper layer of these flip-flopped turbidites was mixed into the finer sand of the lower layer, suggesting the upper layer had settled while the bottom layer was still in motion. That would mean that the two layers were deposited within hours to days of one another. These three events included the 1700 Cascadia quake, as well as quakes 1,200 years ago and 1,500 years ago. It took many years to conduct additional radiocarbon dating, gather corresponding earthquake records from other sources like lakebeds in California and ponder the meaning of these bizarre ""doublet"" turbidites. But ultimately, Goldfiner said, he came to realize that these San Andreas turbidites might represent two different quakes: One, from the far-off Cascadia region, which shook off only lighter silt and sand, and the second, from a soon-after San Andreas quake that was locally stronger and could move coarser material. ""That would explain it,"" Goldfinger said. ""It would explain the match-up of ages… that's what broke the dam."" The researchers argue in their new paper, published Sept. 29 in the journal Geosphere , that large quakes in Cascadia can transfer stress to the neighboring San Andreas, which then leads to a San Andreas earthquake not long after. Earthquakes triggering one another are not unheard of, said Harold Tobin , a seismologist at the University of Washington who was not involved in the research. But most of those examples occur in the same fault zone. ""There aren’t really examples that I can think of where two different types of plate boundary faults are so tightly coupled as what’s proposed in this paper,"" Tobin told Live Science. The work was carefully done, he said, but ""for me, the jury is still out on whether there could be other explanations for the sediment deposits or not."" Cascadia and the northern San Andreas region are highly seismically active, and many other faults could trigger earthquakes, Tobin said. Sedimentary deposits are complicated to interpret, and there are uncertainties inherent in radiocarbon dating. ""There are an awful lot of reasons why this is a complicated system,"" Tobin said. ""This is an intriguing set of observations, but it’s going to take even more detailed work to corroborate."" Goldfinger said he hoped the work would inspire Cascadia geologists and San Andreas geologists to work more closely together to do that detailed work. ""We all have a lot to learn from each other,"" he said. ""I’m hoping it will ratchet up the quality of science on both sides.""",https://www.livescience.com/planet-earth/earthquakes/link-between-cascadia-and-san-andreas-fault-earthquakes-discovered-30-years-after-lost-vessel-stumbled-across-key-data,Science,livescience.com,,https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/fiVDWLoLHzaFv9TCieASNY-1600-80.jpg,2025-10-13T15:09:46+00:00,abd2aac973447e7e61aeb0c5eb63364ae000d13a

So far in 2025, Campi Flegrei has produced five earthquakes above magnitude 4, and the volcano has been showing signs of unrest since 2005. But most of the earthquakes triggered in the region are going undetected, according to a new study that used AI to pinpoint tens of thousands of seismic events that have gone under the radar over the past few years. ""We've known that this is a risky place for a long time,"" study co-author William Ellsworth , a professor emeritus of geophysics at Stanford University, said in a statement . ""Now we're seeing for the first time the geologic structures that are responsible."" Over the past 40,000 years, Campi Flegrei has produced two of the largest eruptions in Europe, and evidence suggests the volcano's earlier history was just as explosive . Scientists have been recording unrest at Campi Flegrei since the 1950s, but monitoring efforts increased in the 1980s after a swarm of 16,000 earthquakes prompted the evacuation of 40,000 residents. To investigate modern threats from Campi Flegrei, Ellsworth and his colleagues developed an AI tool capable of identifying earthquakes that previous methods couldn't pick out. Traditionally, seismologists identify earthquakes by analyzing seismograms, which are graphs with wiggly lines that represent shaking in the ground over time. Researchers look for a sudden increase in the wiggles' size, and this process is known as ""phase picking,"" said study co-author Greg Beroza , a professor of geophysics at Stanford University. ""That's a simple and often effective means of picking a phase, but it doesn't 'learn' how to do it better so that it improves with time,"" Beroza told Live Science in an email. ""In our approach, we train a machine learning model to pick phases. We base it on the collection of millions of examples where experts have done this already, and our method is designed to learn how to do this more effectively."" Get the world’s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox. The team chose to have their tool analyze Campi Flegrei before other volcanoes for several reasons, including there being an urgent need to better understand this volcano's behavior, Beroza said. More than 360,000 people live inside Campi Flegrei's 7-mile-long (11 kilometers) caldera, and roughly 1.5 million people reside in the wider area. Unrest over the past 20 years ticked up in 2018 — and while there are currently no signs of an eruption, a particularly violent or shallow earthquake could present a huge danger to people as well as damage buildings, according to the statement. The results from the AI tool, published Sept. 4 in the journal Science , reveal that three-quarters of earthquakes at Campi Flegrei between 2022 and mid-2025 went undetected. While traditional methods documented 12,000 earthquakes in this period, AI shows the number was closer to 54,000. By mapping the location of these earthquakes, the researchers discovered faults — cracks in Earth's crust that can grind against each other and cause earthquakes — that previous methods hadn't highlighted. Notably, the team found two faults converging beneath Pozzuoli, a town west of Naples where evacuations took place in the 1980s. The location of these faults suggests ""an earthquake in the magnitude 5 range is not out of the question,"" Ellsworth said. By mapping recent earthquakes in the Campi Flegrei region, researchers revealed several never-before-seen faults. This map shows two faults running almost parallel beneath the town of Pozzuoli, potentially spelling trouble. (Image credit: Xing Tan) This wasn't the only striking finding. Pozzuoli experienced uplift in the 1980s, and the same is happening again now , with the ground beneath the town rising by about 4 inches (10 centimeters) each year. It turns out, the area of uplift is encircled by several faults, forming a thin, well-marked ""ring fault"" that extends offshore, according to the statement. ""Our Italian colleagues were surprised to see the ring so clearly,"" study lead author Xing Tan , a doctoral student in Beroza's lab, said in the statement. ""They expected to see something in the south where previous data had revealed scattered seismicity, but in the north, they'd never seen it so clearly."" Seismic activity along the ring fault could help predict changes in the system, as well as hint at the magnitudes of future earthquakes, Beroza said. But it doesn't provide new information about the likelihood or timing of Campi Flegrei's next eruption. ""All the analyzed seismicity from 2022 to mid-2025 is shallow, at depths above 4 kilometers (2.5 miles) and does not indicate any migration of magma towards the surface,"" Beroza said. The team's results for Campi Flegrei indicate that the AI tool could be useful for other volcanoes, too. Places that have recently seen an uptick in seismic activity, such as Santorini in Greece , could benefit from a clearer understanding of the underlying geology, the researchers said in the statement.",https://www.livescience.com/planet-earth/volcanos/ai-reveals-hidden-ring-fault-that-is-unleashing-earthquakes-at-italys-campi-flegrei-volcano,Science,livescience.com,,https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/E4BvfkecbNtgANg7L2FxNK-1685-80.jpg,2025-10-13T14:45:32+00:00,05e789547d8ff86267ae643ef4cd0245c6cfc12a
45122b852a70,'Planet Y' theory hints at hidden Earth-size world lurking in the solar system — and it could be much closer to us than 'Planet Nine',,"Astronomers believe they have uncovered evidence of a previously unknown ninth planet lurking in the not-too-distant reaches of the solar system . This hypothetical world, dubbed ""Planet Y,"" could be around the same size as Earth and may exist alongside another popular Planet Nine candidate — potentially bringing our cosmic neighborhood's planetary tally to 10, if both can be confirmed. However, despite researchers' claims that this newly theorized world could be found within three years, there is no proof of its existence, and some experts are skeptical of the new findings. The search for a ninth solar system world started after the discovery of Neptune in 1846 and was temporarily concluded in the 1930s with the discovery of Pluto, which was subsequently downgraded to dwarf planet status in 2006. But the hunt restarted in 2016, when Caltech astronomers Mike Brown and Konstantin Batygin proposed their Planet Nine hypothesis , which suggested that the unusual orbits of about a dozen large objects beyond Neptune were caused by the gravitational pull of a massive hidden object. This hypothetical world, also known as Planet X, likely lurks somewhere within the Kuiper Belt — a giant disk of asteroids, comets and dwarf planets (including Pluto) that orbit the sun beyond the eight known planets — but has so far evaded detection . Now, in a study published Aug. 21 in the journal Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society , another group of researchers claims to have uncovered evidence of a completely new Planet Nine (P9) candidate, which they've dubbed Planet Y. This hypothetical world, which would also lurk within the Kuiper Belt, could be around twice as near to Earth as Planet X — and it may be much closer in size to our own planet, too. Its potential existence does not discount the Planet X theory, the researchers noted. The team came to this conclusion after analyzing the trajectories of 50 Kuiper Belt objects (KBOs) and discovering that they were tilted by around 15 degrees compared with the rest of the solar system's planets. The only thing that could explain this tilt was a hidden world, they argued. ""We started trying to come up with explanations other than a planet that could explain the tilt, but what we found is that you actually need a planet there,"" study lead author Amir Siraj , an astrophysicist at Princeton University, recently told CNN . ""This paper is not a discovery of a planet,"" he added. ""But it's certainly the discovery of a puzzle for which a planet is a likely solution."" Get the world’s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox. Researchers came up with the Planet Y theory after noticing a strange tilt in around 50 objects across the Kuiper Belt, beyond the orbit of Neptune. (Image credit: Getty Images) Based on their calculations, the study team believes that Planet Y is likely a rocky world with a mass somewhere between that of Mercury and that of Earth. This is significantly smaller than the hypothesized mass of Planet X, which is proposed as a gas giant up to 10 times more massive than Earth. The researchers also propose that Planet Y is located somewhere between 100 and 200 times farther from the sun than Earth is. That's not too far beyond the orbit of Neptune, which orbits the sun at 30 times the Earth-sun distance, and it's much closer to us than Planet X, which is likely at least 400 times farther from the sun than Earth is. (At these distances, both planets would reflect very little light back to Earth, making them hard to spot directly.) If it exists, Planet Y would also be tilted by up to 10 degrees compared with the orbital plane shared by the eight known planets — another factor that would make it harder to detect, the researchers wrote. However, not everyone agrees with the new proposal. Samantha Lawler , an astronomer at the University of Regina in Saskatchewan and a critic of the Planet X hypothesis, told CNN that the findings were ""not definitive,"" largely because of the small sample size of KBOs included in the study. Patryk Sofia Lykawka , an astronomer at Kindai University in Japan who specializes in KBOs, added that Planet Y was ""plausible"" but required more observations to be considered a likely possibility. To fully prove the existence of Planet Y or Planet X, researchers will either have to get very lucky and directly observe the elusive worlds, or find many more KBOs that fit with the patterns they have uncovered. Researchers believe the newly operational Vera C. Rubin observatory could help find Planet Y or Planet X in the next few years. (Image credit: Hernan Stockebrand) This may not take very long, thanks to the newly operational Vera C. Rubin Observatory in Chile, which has begun scanning the night sky with the world's largest digital camera. Many experts think this survey will uncover thousands more KBOs in the coming years, which could provide the data needed to firm up these theories. ""I think within the first two to three years [of the observatory's mission], it'll become definitive,"" Siraj said. ""If Planet Y is in the field of view of the telescope, it will be able to find it directly."" But equally, if the researchers do not find what they are looking for within this time frame, both theories could end up being chucked out for good. Other Planet Nine candidates Planet Y is not the only alternative P9 candidate that has emerged in recent years. Several other hypothetical worlds have been proposed, but all have been largely disproved. In May, researchers spotted a faint infrared dot that they thought might be a ninth planet . However, this finding was largely discounted because whatever object was responsible for this reading would have to be orbiting the sun in a plane perpendicular to the rest of the planets, which is extremely unlikely. There is also a possibility that multiple rogue planets — worlds that have been expelled from alien star systems and then captured by the sun's gravity — could lurk even farther from our home star. In 2023, calculations from Siraj revealed that there could be room for up to five Earth-like, rocky planets to hide in the very outer reaches of the solar system. Some astronomers have also proposed alternative explanations for Planet X, including that the gravitational anomalies are caused by a baby black hole or are the result of some alternative form of gravity we do not yet understand. Others have suggested that this missing world could be smaller than we think and may instead be surrounded by dozens of moons . On the other hand, some experts think the recent discovery of several dwarf planet candidates in the Kuiper Belt — including 2017 OF201 and 2023 KQ14 , which were announced in May and July, respectively — make it less likely that Planet X exists because these objects do not behave as this theory predicts. At this moment, all we can be certain of is that we still have much to learn about the vast backyard of our cosmic neighborhood.",https://www.livescience.com/space/planets/planet-y-theory-hints-at-hidden-earth-size-world-lurking-in-the-solar-system-and-it-could-be-much-closer-to-us-than-planet-nine,Science,livescience.com,,https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/JpgxRtvMNUm6hVH8Wom2NS-1600-80.jpg,2025-10-13T13:21:59+00:00,9aa0bb73b2f0504c45af2095cf8dd85a7489d123
3f6c178eb73c,What is type 5 diabetes? Newly recognized form of the disease gets name,,"Scientists have formally recognized a new type of diabetes, dubbed type 5 diabetes, that is thought to affect 20 to 25 million people worldwide . The condition, which is most common in Asia and Africa, was first identified more than 70 years ago but remained largely overlooked until now. Conventionally, medical textbooks describe three main types of diabetes : In type 1 , the immune system mistakenly attacks insulin-producing cells in the pancreas, leading to dangerously high blood sugar and a risk of ketoacidosis — a potentially life-threatening condition in which the body breaks down fat for energy. Type 2 , the most common form, develops when the body doesn't respond properly to insulin or doesn't make enough of it. Gestational diabetes occurs temporarily during pregnancy, marked by insulin resistance that's thought to be driven by hormonal changes. Additionally, there are other rare forms of diabetes that can result from specific genetic mutations or diseases. But now, scientists say there's another type of diabetes with a very different cause from the other kinds. It was formally classified as ""type 5 diabetes"" during an international meeting of experts in India earlier this year. (They chose the label ""type 5"" because other researchers have already proposed ""type 3"" and ""type 4"" for other forms of diabetes.) ""Type 5 diabetes is characterized by insufficient insulin secretion leading to elevated blood glucose levels, similar to other forms of diabetes,"" Dr. Rachel Reinert , an endocrinologist and assistant professor at the University of Michigan, told Live Science in an email. ""However, type 5 diabetes is not associated with autoimmunity (as in type 1 diabetes) nor insulin resistance (as is common in type 2 diabetes)."" It also lacks the features of the more rare type 3 and type 4 diabetes, she said. ""Individuals with type 5 diabetes typically have low body weight and a history of undernutrition starting in early life,"" Reinert said. Doctors think that chronic undernutrition damages the pancreas early in life, leaving its insulin-producing cells permanently weakened. So the pancreas cannot make enough insulin, but if a patient is given insulin as treatment, their cells are able to respond to it. Get the world’s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox. Treatment for type 5 diabetes needs to be managed carefully as too much insulin, coupled with too little food — a common reality in low-income countries — could result in dangerously low blood sugar. ""It is important for all patients with diabetes to know which specific type of diabetes they have, so they can get the right treatment,"" Reinert said. The YODA study Earlier this year, the Young-Onset Diabetes in sub-Saharan Africa (YODA) study, published in The Lancet Diabetes & Endocrinology , renewed interest in the condition. The team initially set out to investigate type 1 diabetes among nearly 900 young adults across Cameroon, Uganda and South Africa. But when the researchers analyzed blood samples, they found that roughly two-thirds of participants lacked the autoimmune markers seen in type 1 diabetes. Further testing revealed that these individuals still produced small but measurable amounts of insulin, unlike classic type 1 cases. But their insulin levels were below the range typically seen in type 2 diabetes. These findings pointed to a distinct, non-autoimmune, insulin-deficient type of diabetes. This was not the first time in history that the condition had been observed. In the early 1950s, British physician Philip Hugh-Jones encountered a group of 13 patients at his diabetes clinic near Kingston, Jamaica, whose symptoms did not fit type 1 or type 2 diabetes. Hugh-Jones called their condition ""type J,"" for Jamaica, but the label was forgotten and the condition was overlooked for decades. What's in a name? Correctly naming a disease not only helps guide clinicians to the best treatment options, it can also help researchers to track its prevalence and identify which factors affect patients' outcomes, Reinert said. Although type 5 diabetes has likely existed for decades, a lack of research has kept it poorly understood. Recognition is key to ensuring the condition is no longer overlooked, said Chittaranjan Yajnik , director of the Diabetes Unit at KEM Hospital in Pune, India, and co-author of an international consensus statement on type 5 diabetes published in The Lancet Global Health . ""It needs further research and funding to study its aetiology [causes], mechanism and treatment,"" he told Live Science in an email.

5bb10a857ec4,'An increasing attack on water resources from multiple fronts': Scientists warn 'day zero droughts' could hit before 2030,,"Almost three-quarters of drought-prone regions around the world will be at risk of extreme water shortages known as ""day zero droughts"" by 2100 if emissions aren't reduced, and a third of these regions could be hit before 2030, according to a new study. Areas under threat include cities in the U.S., the Mediterranean and southern Africa. ""At some point, the water might run out,"" Christian Franzke , a climate scientist and project leader at the Institute for Basic Science Center for Climate Physics at Pusan National University in South Korea, told Live Science. ""You're at home, you turn on your water tap in the kitchen or bathroom, and no water would come out."" The day-zero-drought idea — when local water demand from people, industry and agriculture exceeds the regional water supply provided by rain and reservoirs — became more prominent after 2018. A long-term drought pushed water levels in dams around Cape Town, South Africa, close to a critically low level that — had it been reached — would have caused most water supplies to be switched off , leaving about 4 million people without water. Fortunately, strict water-use restrictions were effective, and a couple of months later, heavy rain allowed the dam levels to recover. This wasn't an isolated incident. On June 19, 2019, Chennai, India — which was home to some 11 million people at the time — declared that day zero had been reached because all four of the big city reservoirs had run dry. People had to line up for hours to wait for a small allocation of water brought in by trucks from other areas. It is well known that climate change will make many regions drier through reduced rainfall, river flow and reservoir levels. But to work out when and where the most severe water shortages will hit, Franzke and his colleagues turned to climate models that factor in human water consumption as well as rainfall and river flow. The team used the Community Earth System Model (CESM), from the U.S. National Center for Atmospheric Research, and the French Centre National de Recherches Météorologiques (CNRM) model and looked at what would happen under two scenarios — one of intermediate greenhouse gas emissions, which is roughly the course the world is on at present and is projected to result in about 4.8 degrees Fahrenheit (2.7 degrees Celsius) of warming above pre-industrial levels by 2100. The other scenario was for higher emissions caused by national rivalry and reduced global cooperation is projected to lead to about 6.4 F (3.6 C) of warming. A 2018 drought in Cape Town, South Africa, led to strict water-use restrictions after water levels around the city reached critically low levels. (Image credit: Morgana Wingard/Getty Images) Both CNRM scenarios project that at least half of drought-affected regions will face unprecedented water scarcity by 2100, with 22% experiencing emergence before 2030. Get the world’s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox. Under the higher-emission scenario, the CNRM model projects that the frequency of day zero droughts will grow sharply over the coming decades, with hotspots across the Mediterranean, southern Africa, and parts of North America and Asia. It suggests that by 2100, 74% of drought-prone regions globally will be at risk of severe and persistent droughts under a high-emissions scenario. More than one-third of these regions, including some in the U.S., may face severe water scarcity between 2020 and 2030, according to the study, which was published Sept. 23 in the journal Nature Communications . The CESM model projected that smaller areas will be affected and that it will take longer for day zero drought to emerge. ""It surprised us how soon this might actually occur in so many places,"" Franzke said, adding that the study shows that global warming causes — and will accelerate — day zero drought conditions. ""We have hotspot regions about the Mediterranean, so Nice in France would be under threat, in southern Africa, Cape Town again would probably be in a hotspot,"" Franzke added. According to the CNRM model, the U.S. cities at risk by 2030 include Chicago; Washington, D.C.; Phoenix; San Diego; and Milwaukee, Franzke said. By 2060, Minneapolis; Las Vegas; Baltimore; Kansas City, Missouri; and Jacksonville, Florida, are projected to join the group. By the end of the century, the researchers said, day-zero-drought conditions could threaten some 750 million people globally, including 470 million people in cities and 290 million people in rural areas. Washington D.C. is one of the U.S. cities identified as being at risk from day zero drought by by 2030. (Image credit: halbergman/Getty Images) ""The findings are consistent with the physics that is driving a warmer, thirstier atmosphere to more rapidly drain fresh water from the continents and confirms known hotspots for increasing drought severity that also depend on changing wind patterns,"" Richard Allan , a climate scientist at the University of Reading in the U.K. who wasn't involved in the work, told Live Science. ""It paints a picture of an increasing attack on water resources from multiple fronts that is already emerging and particularly impacting urban populations."" Franzke and his colleagues also warned that the gap between day-zero-drought events in the future may shorten — particularly in the Mediterranean, Asia, southern Africa and Australia — thus making it harder for the areas to recover. This might make it impossible for people to live in badly hit areas for extended periods, Franzke said. Whether the biggest factor driving an increase in day zero droughts is climate change or water use will vary by region. ""It's very location dependent,"" he said. But knowing which areas are most at risk could aid the development of local and integrated water management strategies, said Franzke, as will working at a grander scale on policies to speed up the transition away from fossil fuels and toward clean energy to arrest climate change. ""It is only by adapting to intensifying prolonged dry periods but also rapidly cutting greenhouse gases that the increasing impacts from more severe dry extremes in a warming world can be limited,"" Allan said.",https://www.livescience.com/planet-earth/climate-change/an-increasing-attack-on-water-resources-from-multiple-fronts-scientists-warn-day-zero-droughts-could-hit-before-2030,Science,livescience.com,,https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/tAosTVNxi45bDGgzbFbxHW-1600-80.jpg,2025-10-13T12:42:27+00:00,1028be99e28bd69304eb7fa446ac2c1a64e23806
c2f146a28391,Hidden 'doomed' star revealed by James Webb Space Telescope could solve decades-old mystery,,"The James Webb Space Telescope ( JWST ) has revealed a hidden ""doomed"" star that could help solve a giant astrophysical mystery. The star is a massive red supergiant, which JWST snapped just before the star exploded in a fiery supernova. Massive red supergiants should, in theory, cause most supernovas, but they're rarely observed. The latest JWST observation, described in a new study published Wednesday (Oct. 8) in The Astrophysical Journal Letters , adds weight to the idea that these giants are often obscured by clouds of dust. ""For multiple decades, we have been trying to determine exactly what the explosions of red supergiant stars look like,"" study lead author Charlie Kilpatrick , a research assistant professor studying massive stars at Northwestern University in Illinois, said in a statement . ""Only now, with JWST, do we finally have the quality of data and infrared observations that allow us to say precisely the exact type of red supergiant that exploded and what its immediate environment looked like."" Stars around the size of our sun swell up near the end of their lifecycles to become red giants before going supernova . Red supergiants are massive stars on the verge of detonating, typically measuring hundreds or thousands of times larger than our sun. The All-Sky Automated Survey for Supernovae first detected the supernova from the newly imaged supergiant in June. The supernova, officially named SN 2025pht, came from a galaxy called NGC 1637 , which is located 38 million light-years from Earth — pretty close for something in space. The authors of the new study identified the supergiant's source star (its progenitor) by comparing historical Hubble Space Telescope data to new JWST images of NGC 1637 taken before and after the explosion. Researchers combined observations from JWST and Hubble to make this image of spiral galaxy NGC 1637, with additional images of the massive red supergiant before and after it went supernova. (Image credit: NASA, ESA, CSA, STScI, Charles Kilpatrick (Northwestern), Aswin Suresh (Northwestern)) Researchers like Kilpatrick have suggested that the most massive aging stars might also be the dustiest, so their light is blocked. This possible explanation tracks with the new JWST observation. The star shone about 100,000 times brighter than our sun, but the team estimated that its dust was so thick that this light was made more than 100 times dimmer, according to the statement. The dust was also particularly effective at blocking shorter, blue wavelengths of light . Fortunately, JWST's powerful infrared detection could see the longer red wavelengths, providing an unprecedented detailed look at a supergiant on the brink of going supernova. Get the world’s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.

46b66457ddb7,An 'ice tsunami' in 2024 ripped through the Yukon with such force it tore up trees and the riverbed,,"A landslide into a river in Canada's Yukon territory last December sent a tsunami of ice slabs flying over two football fields away, severing trees in the process. Now, new research suggests that the damage from this ""ice tsunami"" was worsened by the destructive force of the river ice. However, it was also restricted to a smaller area than if the landslide had hit in summer and created an ice-free wave. ""This effect is an important consideration for future landslide and tsunami hazard assessments in cold regions,"" study author Derek Cronmiller , a permafrost geologist with the Yukon Geological Survey, wrote in a new paper. Cronmiller visited the remote disaster site 24 days after the landslide and published his findings Sept. 25 in the journal Landslides . The ice tsunami hit on Dec. 17, 2024, when a steep slope above the Takhini River failed without warning. About 4.1 million cubic feet (118,000 cubic meters) of dirt and rock tumbled into the river, which was covered in ice at the time. The impact created an ice-studded tsunami that washed over 17.8 acres (7.2 hectares) of the river and its banks. River ice cracked up to 820 feet (250 m) away, and chunks of ice over 43 square feet (4 square m) were found 656 feet (200 m) from the landslide. The icy wave scoured vegetation from the river's banks, stripping all but the four largest trees from the bank opposite the landslide. On that slope, only trees with trunks of diameters over 11.8 inches (30 centimeters) survived. The ice tsunami demolished all but the four largest trees from the bank opposite the landslide. (Image credit: Derek Cronmiller) Some slabs of river ice were flipped over, with about 4 inches to a foot (10 to 30 cm) of sand stuck to them. These slabs had been frozen solid to the bottom of the river, Cronmiller wrote, and the force of the tsunami ripped the riverbed up with them. Landslides are typically triggered by snowmelt, rainfall or human activity, but Cronmiller found no evidence of an external trigger for the Dec. 17 event. Instead, the slope underwent a ""brittle failure,"" meaning it cracked without any signs of warping or deformation. Get the world’s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox. Fortunately, no one was hurt in the incident, which happened 15.5 miles (25 km) northwest of Whitehorse, Yukon, in a rural area. The river is a destination for outdoor activities, however. Dogsledders and snowmobilers use it as a thoroughfare in winter, while river rafters traverse the Takhini in the summer. The landslide narrowed the river by 50% and clogged it with debris, which could be hazardous to paddlers for years to come, Cronmiller wrote. The new study found that it will likely take the Takhini River more than a decade to carve its way back through the landslide debris.",https://www.livescience.com/planet-earth/rivers-oceans/an-ice-tsunami-in-2024-ripped-through-the-yukon-with-such-force-it-tore-up-trees-and-the-riverbed,Science,livescience.com,,https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/CkE2MW7dsUgtfQxaunWUxG-1600-80.jpg,2025-10-13T11:24:28+00:00,1cacc67e7f66dfd19fe14d2f74a86c456ab68d35
ec55e0e408f9,"$100,000 quadrillion asteroid Psyche may be the product of metal volcanoes, study hints",,"The asteroid Psyche may have once had vents that spewed molten metal — but only if it is chemically similar to rare, metal-rich meteorites, a new study suggests. The study, which was published online July 31 in the Journal of Geophysical Research: Planets , could explain why the space rock has an unusual metallic cloak. Potato-shaped asteroid Psyche, a member of the main asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter, is unique in being super-shiny. Radar measurements indicate that, on average, its surface reflects nearly a third of the sunlight shining on it, making it at least twice as reflective as most asteroids. Because of its reflectivity, scientists have posited that Psyche isn’t just mostly metal but may actually be the exposed iron-rich heart of a planetary building block. Samuel Courville , a planetary scientist at Arizona State University, described Psyche to Live Science in an email as ""a relic from the dawn of the solar system ."" Some have estimated the value of its metals to be a staggering $100,000 quadrillion . However, this shininess may be mostly skin-deep. In 2020, calculations involving updated estimates of Psyche’s mass and volume suggested that the asteroid’s density wasbetween 231 lbs per cubic foot (3,700 kilograms per cubic meter) and 256 lbs/cubic foot (4,100 kg/cubic meter). While denser than most asteroids, it’s only about half the density expected if Psyche were made entirely of iron and nickel. This, along with surface heat emission data, indicated that while Psyche's bulk is largely non-metallic, the asteroid probably possesses a metal-rich cloak. Scientists still aren’t sure how Psyche acquired this coat. Although many phenomena could be responsible, the most favored at present is ferrovolcanism . ""Ferrovolcanism is like normal volcanism except instead of molten rock, the 'lava' is molten metal,"" Courville, who wasn’t involved in the new study, said.

The difference in density between the core's solid exterior and molten interior would have created enough pressure for the latter to pierce into the overlying mantle and the asteroid’s surface, creating vents that spewed molten metal. But ferrovolcanism can only work with specific chemical compositions, since it greatly depends on how much pressure builds up in the inner core. Data from meteorites — space rocks that fall on Earth’s surface — help constrain the range of these chemical combinations. Get the world’s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox. To determine the chemistry that could have spawned Psyche’s iron-spewing vents, the authors of the new study — Jaap Jorritsma , a Ph.D. student at Delft University of Technology and Win van Westrenen, a professor of earth sciences at Vrije University in Amsterdam — created computer models of the asteroid. They considered the asteroid to have a chemical makeup similar to one of three types of meteorites : EH-chondrites (rare, stony meteorites lacking iron), H-chondrites (commonplace, stony meteorites with moderate amounts of iron) and mesosiderites (rare, iron-rich meteorites). The researchers then ran simulations to figure out which chemical composition was most favorable for ferrovolcanism to occur. The researchers found that Psyche’s bulk must be rich in metals like iron, as low iron content would lead to tiny cores in which the internal pressure generated is insufficient to push out magma. This meant that Psyche was most likely to have had ferrovolcanism if it contained large amounts of mesosiderite. H-chondrites could lead to the spewing of molten metal too, but only if they had a relatively high density. In contrast, EH-chondrites only produced tiny cores that lacked iron-rich exteriors, making them unlikely to constitute part of Psyche. The researchers expect NASA’s ongoing Psyche mission will provide evidence supporting their findings. Scheduled to arrive at Psyche by July 2029, the spacecraft will spend two years photographing the asteroid and collecting spectroscopic data. Courville said that these snapshots will reveal if surface metal is in large outcrops or flows, which would indicate that ferrovolcanism had occurred in the space rock's past.",https://www.livescience.com/space/asteroids/usd100-000-quadrillion-asteroid-psyche-may-be-the-product-of-metal-volcanoes-study-hints,Science,livescience.com,,https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/J7AodqhZVM5EioRZpHWrHV-1600-80.jpg,2025-10-13T11:00:00+00:00,311d56c10ccc428c0feb169995550b92f22cbd50

The skeleton originally had jointed arms and legs, but only a portion of its left leg remains today. Its skull features large, round eye sockets and a toothy grin. The bronze figurine measures roughly 2.6 inches (6.6 centimeters) tall and is in the collection of the Getty Villa in Los Angeles, California. According to a 1980 study by then-Getty curator Faya Causey Frel, the skeleton was a kind of ""memento mori"" — a symbol of the brevity of life and the inevitability of death. The spooky skeletons were probably handed out at dinner parties in a nod to Epicureanism, the philosophical system that considered that because death is humans' main fear, we should take pleasure in what life has to offer. Banqueting and death were often linked in Roman art and literature, according to the Getty.

He threw it down upon the table a time or two, and its mobile articulation caused it to assume grotesque attitudes."" Trimalchio, the host, then exclaims that ""this skeleton before us here is as important as we ever were! Let's live then while we may and life is dear.""

104e60cde498,Scientists 'reawaken' ancient microbes from permafrost — and discover they start churning out CO2 soon after,,"Microbes that have been suspended in permafrost for up to 40,000 years could ""reawaken"" and start churning out greenhouse gases if Arctic summers grow much longer, new research suggests. Under future climate conditions, microbes that have been dormant since the last ice age (2.6 million to 11,700 years ago) may only need a few months to reactivate, according to a study published Sept. 23 in the Journal of Geophysical Research: Geosciences . If they do so for even a part of the year, scientists warn this could trigger a feedback loop that would accelerate permafrost thaw and global warming . Permafrost is a mix of soil, rocks and ice that has been frozen solid for at least two years straight. A hot spell may thaw the topmost layer of permafrost, known as the active layer, but ancient microbes lurk much deeper down, in layers that thaw only if temperatures rise significantly and for extended periods. For the new study, researchers traveled to Alaska, where permafrost underlies 85% of the land . ""You might have a single hot day in the Alaskan summer, but what matters much more is the lengthening of the summer season to where these warm temperatures extend into the autumn and spring,"" study lead author Tristan Caro , a postdoctoral research associate in geobiology at Caltech, said in a statement . Caro and his colleagues collected samples from the Permafrost Research Tunnel near Fairbanks. The tunnel sits 50 feet (15 meters) below ground and extends more than 350 feet (107 m) into the permafrost, offering a glimpse into life during the late Pleistocene epoch (129,000 to 11,700 years ago). Their aim was to determine resuscitation and growth rates in microbes that lived during this time. But as Caro entered the tunnel, he also noticed mammoth and bison bones protruding from the icy walls, according to the statement. ""The first thing you notice when you walk in there is that it smells really bad,"" said Caro, who conducted the research as a graduate student at the University of Colorado Boulder. ""To a microbiologist, that's very exciting because interesting smells are often microbial."" Get the world’s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox. Back in the lab, the researchers drenched the samples in water containing unusually heavy hydrogen atoms, also known as deuterium. They then incubated the samples in refrigerators set to 25, 39 or 54 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 4, 4 and 12 degrees Celsius) and regularly examined them for changes in microbial activity. ""We wanted to simulate what happens in an Alaskan summer, under future climate conditions where these temperatures reach deeper areas of the permafrost,"" Caro said. One month into the experiment, the team didn't note much change, even in the two warmer samples. A handful of microbes had awakened from their long slumber, but only 0.001% to 0.01% of cells were replaced daily by new, active ones. The Permafrost Research Tunnel in Alaska is operated and maintained by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. (Image credit: Tristan Caro) In the months that followed, however, everything changed. The deuterium in the samples enabled the researchers to track how much water microbes consumed to build the fatty membranes around their cells. This revealed that the ancient organisms preferentially produced fatty acids called glycolipids, which researchers think may be involved in cryopreservation. Six months into the experiment, the microbes incubated at 39 F and 54 F had undergone ""dramatic"" changes in community structure and activity levels, according to the study. The samples were less diverse than active layers of permafrost, but the microbes were as active as their more modern counterparts, even producing slimy structures called biofilms that were visible to the naked eye. ""These are not dead samples by any means,"" Caro said. About 85% of Alaska's land is underlain by permafrost, which is thawing at alarming rates. (Image credit: Brandt Meixell/USGS) The results have implications for the Arctic and Earth's climate more broadly, because microbes in the permafrost survive on organic matter, which they convert into carbon dioxide and methane. Global temperatures are rising faster in the Arctic than anywhere else in the world, thawing the permafrost at alarming rates and for increasing lengths of time. As Arctic summers grow longer and temperatures rise in the deeper layers, colonies of ancient microbes could awaken and start emitting carbon. Permafrost in northern regions currently holds about twice as much carbon as Earth's atmosphere, so large-scale releases could contribute significantly to climate change. This would accelerate permafrost thaw, triggering a vicious cycle of warming, more thaw and more warming. ""It's one of the biggest unknowns in climate responses,"" study co-author Sebastian Kopf , an associate professor of geological sciences at the University of Colorado Boulder, said in the statement. ""How will the thawing of all this frozen ground, where we know there's tons of carbon stored, affect the ecology of these regions and the rate of climate change?"" But the study only examined ancient microbes from one location, and microbes in other regions may react differently to warming, the researchers noted. ""There's so much permafrost in the world — in Alaska, Siberia and in other northern cold regions,"" Caro said. ""We've only sampled one tiny slice of that.""",https://www.livescience.com/planet-earth/arctic/scientists-reawaken-ancient-microbes-from-permafrost-and-discover-they-start-churning-out-co2-soon-after,Science,livescience.com,,https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/P5sPEab56hipEYSUFmHV4N-1500-80.jpg,2025-10-13T09:43:13+00:00,e190fd1dc28c735128556a45d4ec034cd7dac1c7
825ee7e84881,What if Christopher Columbus had never reached the Americas?,,"Christopher Columbus sailed westward in 1492, hoping to find a new route to China and South Asia, but he hit a major roadblock — the Americas — and landed in the Caribbean. Columbus wasn't the first European to reach the Western Hemisphere; the Vikings had landed in Newfoundland about 500 years earlier . But the Vikings didn't colonize North America , and Columbus' expedition led to the large-scale colonization of the Western Hemisphere by Europeans. So, how would history have played out if Columbus' voyage had failed — perhaps if his vessels had sunk or the crews were forced to turn around before reaching the Western Hemisphere? Some experts told us that, in a sense, Columbus' voyage did fail. He ""did not fulfill his goal to prove a new westward route to Asia's riches,"" Douglas Hunter , an independent scholar who holds a doctorate in history and has written extensively about Columbus and other explorers, told Live Science in an email. Columbus himself did not admit this . Instead, he continued to claim that the lands he had ""discovered"" were part of Asia, even as evidence mounted to the contrary. Who would have ""discovered"" the New World? Indigenous peoples reached the Americas at least 23,000 years ago , but Europeans didn't arrive until much later. Scholars agreed that if Columbus had failed to reach the Western Hemisphere, someone else from Europe would have reached it soon enough. The ""1480s had demonstrated that Atlantic exploration was profitable, thanks to such products as sugar, cod, seals, whales, walrus and narwhal ivory, West African gold, and Icelandic and African slaves,"" Felipe Fernández-Armesto , a history professor at the University of Notre Dame, told Live Science in an email. ""So landfall on the far shore would [have happened] some time."" Who would have reached the Western Hemisphere and what would have happened is a source of debate. Geoffrey Symcox , a professor emeritus of history at UCLA, said that Spain would have likely lost to its Iberian neighbor. ""If Spain didn't try again, the voyage would have been sponsored by Portugal,"" Symcox told Live Science in an email. He noted that Portugal had been sailing down the coast of Africa since the early 15th century and that the Portuguese had ventured far enough into the Atlantic to colonize the Azores and Madeira. A map showing the Azores (purple) and Madeira (blue), which are part of Portugal, and the Canary Islands (red), which are part of Spain. The Canary Islands have more favorable conditions for sailing to the Western Hemisphere than the other islands do. (Image credit: Map Data Copyright 2025 Google, INEGI) It's likely that ""if Columbus had failed, the next Atlantic voyage would have been promoted, quickly, by the Portuguese Crown,"" Symcox said. ""The king of Portugal was well aware of Spanish intentions and would have moved fast to pre-empt any further Spanish moves."" Fernández-Armesto isn't so sure that Portugal would have beaten Spain, noting that the Canary Islands, which Spain controlled and which Columbus sailed from, was the best place for launching a westward expedition. It ""would probably happen to a Spanish expedition, as the Canary Islands were, from the point of view of the wind system, the best place to start from,"" Fernández-Armesto said. How would history have unfolded? If a Portuguese explorer had reached the Western Hemisphere first, a number of events would be different. Hunter noted that the Treaty of Tordesillas, in 1494, which divided the Atlantic realm between Spain and Portugal, would not have occurred, as Portugal may not have felt compelled to split the region with Spain. The 16th-century conquests of Hernán Cortés against the Aztec Empire and Francisco Pizarro against the Inca would not have happened as both of them were Spaniards backed by Spain, although someone from Portugal probably would have carried them out, Hunter said. A monument of two of the Pinzón brothers, who were captains of La Pinta and La Niña on Columbus' trans-Atlantic voyage. (Image credit: Ark. Neyman - NV Media/Alamy) If Spain had still reached the Western Hemisphere first, as Fernández-Armesto thinks is likely, then history may not be that different. The ""historical difference would have been slight and the delay probably not significant,"" he said. Linguistically some things could be different. If a Portuguese explorer had reached the Americas first, it's possible Portuguese would be more widely spoken in the Western Hemisphere than it is today. Also, if Columbus had failed to reach the Western Hemisphere, it's no surprise that his name would not be widespread across the Americas. The District of Columbia in the U.S. and the country of Colombia are just two of many places that bear his name. It's possible that North and South America would still have places named for a European explorer. Hunter noted that the Pinzón brothers commanded the Niña and Pinta in Columbus' fleet. If Columbus had failed but the two brothers had later sailed successfully to the Western Hemisphere, it's possible some places could be named after them. Both brothers were highly capable sailors who Columbus considered qualified to captain two of the fleet's vessels. ""The capital district of the United States could be Pinzonia,"" Hunter said. None of the sources Live Science contacted mentioned a scenario in which the Indigenous peoples of the Western Hemisphere would not be adversely affected by European contact through the devastation brought by the diseases they introduced and conquests they carried out. However, it's important to note that the Indigenous peoples of the Western Hemisphere fought back, and today, native groups continue on, practicing their languages and cultures.",https://www.livescience.com/archaeology/what-if-christopher-columbus-had-never-reached-the-americas,Science,livescience.com,,https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5Jk3RHodjCQvsAKCid2i55-1600-80.png,2025-10-13T09:00:00+00:00,2c63cf1a5c0cfd73654ccb78dab08aacdaa53dfb
dbc796fa4153,Physicists capture rare illusion of an object moving at 99.9% the speed of light,,"Using ultra-fast laser pulses and special cameras, scientists have simulated an optical illusion that appears to defy Einstein's theory of special relativity . One consequence of special relativity is that fast-moving objects should appear shortened in the direction of motion — a phenomenon known as Lorentz contraction. This effect has been confirmed indirectly in particle accelerator experiments. But in 1959, mathematician Roger Penrose and physicist James Terrell pointed out that an observer with a camera wouldn't actually see a squashed object at all. Instead, because light from different parts of the object takes different times to reach the camera, it would appear rotated. Although previous models have worked with this illusion, now called the Terrell-Penrose effect, this is the first time it has been done in a lab setting. The team described their results in the journal Communications Physics . ""What I like most is the simplicity,"" Dominik Hornof , a quantum physicist at the Vienna University of Technology and first author of the study, told Live Science. ""With the right idea, you can recreate relativistic effects in a small lab. It shows that even century-old predictions can be brought to life in a really intuitive way."" Re-creating the illusion In the new study, physicists used ultra-fast laser pulses and gated cameras to produce snapshots of a cube and a sphere ""moving"" at nearly the speed of light. The results showed snapshots of rotated objects. This proved the Terrell-Penrose effect to be true. The researchers fired ultra-short laser pulses at their test object and then used a delay generator to tell the camera exactly when to open its shutter (for just billionths of a second). This camera captured single slices of light bouncing off the object. They repeated the process and shifted the object between shots. The team built up the illusion of an object racing at near light speed. (Image credit: Hornof et al., 2025 ; CC BY 4.0 ) But like every study, this one also had its difficulties. Moving any object at or near the speed of light is currently impossible. ""As you get closer to the speed of light, the energy you need grows by a lot,"" Hornof said. We cannot generate enough energy to accelerate something like a cube, and ""that's why we need huge particle accelerators, even just to move electrons close to that speed. It would take a huge amount of energy."" So the team used a clever substitute. ""What we can do is mimic the visual effect,"" Hornof said. They started with a cube of about 3 feet (1 meter) on each side. Then, they fired ultra-short laser pulses — each just 300 picoseconds long, or about a tenth of a billionth of a second — at the object. They captured the reflected light with a gated camera that opened only for that instant and produced a thin ""slice"" each time. After each slice, they moved the cube forward about 1.9 inches (4.8 cm). That is the distance it would have traveled if it were moving at 80% the speed of light during the delay between pulses. Then, the scientists put all of these slices together into a snapshot of the cube in motion. ""When you combine all the slices, the object looks like it's racing incredibly fast, even though it never moved at all,"" Hornof said. ""At the end of the day, it's just geometry."" They repeated the process with a sphere, shifting it by 2.4 inches (6 cm) per step to mimic 99.9% light speed. When the slices were combined, the cube appeared rotated and the sphere looked as if you could peek around its sides. ""The rotation is not physical,"" Hornof said. ""It's an optical illusion. The geometry of how light arrives at the same time tricks our eyes."" That is why the Terrell-Penrose effect does not contradict Einstein's special relativity. A fast-moving object is physically shortened along its direction of travel, but a camera doesn't capture that directly. Because light from the back takes longer to arrive than light from the front, the snapshot shifts in a way that makes the object appear rotated. ""When we did the calculations, we were surprised how beautifully the geometry worked out,"" Hornof said. ""Seeing it appear in the images was really exciting.""

a4018a9fbd72,Hubble went supernova hunting — and found something unexpected: Space photo of the week,,"QUICK FACTS What it is: NGC 6000, a spiral galaxy Where it is: 102 million light-years away in the constellation Scorpius When it was shared: Sept. 29, 2025 Here’s a story for the ages — or maybe a story of the ages. The Hubble Space Telescope ’s latest image, of barred spiral galaxy NGC 6000, is rich in yellow at its center and blue on its outskirts, but it’s what these colors reveal about the ages, masses and temperatures of the galaxy’s stars that makes the portrait truly fascinating. The yellow tells the story of the center of NGC 6000, where stars are old, small and relatively cool. These stars have been shining for billions of years. In astronomy, cool stars are red, while the hottest stars are blue. The latter dominate the outskirts of this galaxy, where its spiral arms are filled with stars that are younger, hotter and larger. These stars are cosmic newborns. The image, which is also available as a panning video , was produced while Hubble searched for supernova explosions — hence the incomplete framing. The aging space telescope targeted the faint glow of supernovas called SN 2007ch and SN 2010as, stars that exploded in 2007 and 2010, respectively. However, while imaging NGC 6000, Hubble also captured something else entirely. Look on the right-hand side of the image, and four faint broken lines can be seen — the path of an asteroid that drifted across Hubble’s field of view as it took four long-exposure images of NGC 6000. The broken lines are red and blue because Hubble used red and blue filters to collect visible light, which makes it easier for astronomers to compare stars by their colors. Although it’s in the constellation Scorpius, which is visible in summer from the Northern Hemisphere, NGC 6000 lies south of the celestial equator, according to The Sky Live . That means it’s more easily visible from the Southern Hemisphere. However, to glimpse it requires at least a 10-inch aperture telescope and a dark sky.

d67f5d676a6a,Which planets are the youngest and oldest in our solar system?,,"About 4.6 billion years ago, a celestial cloud collapsed, paving the way for our solar system to form. Then, a nebula with strong gravitational pull took shape, kick-starting the birth of the sun. But after that, the details leave more room for debate about which planets formed first. So, what do we know about which planets emerged early, and which ones developed later on? Despite advanced techniques like dating organic materials from space, going on multiple visits to the moon, and sending rover expeditions to Mars, planetary scientists are still unsure about the ultimate birth order of the planets in the solar system . Beyond the planets' initial formation, there are also several competing theories to explain the order in which the planets came to be. ""It's complex — there are no easy answers to measuring time in outer space,"" Michael Meyer , chair of the University of Michigan's astronomy department, told Live Science. ""It is the most difficult thing to do in astronomy."" The most commonly accepted explanation for how our solar system's eight planets formed is called accretion — when small particles of gas and dust collide and stick to each other, allowing them to gain gravitational pull and grow over time. One popular theory, which assumes accretion took place, is that the large planets started to form first, far from the sun, according to NASA . As they got bigger, they moved outward, making room for the terrestrial, rocky planets to form. These formations took place closer to the sun and millions of years later (a relatively short time span in astronomical terms). ""In order to form a gas giant planet, you have to have enough gas to make a Jupiter — and that gives us a hard upper limit for how long it can take to form a gas giant,"" Meyer said. ""If you don't get the whole process started fast enough and the gas goes away, then you can't make a gas giant. That's why we think the gas giants formed first."" But a competing theory, called the streaming instability model, offers a different explanation. By allowing planets to gather mass more spontaneously, this theory could allow an entirely different sequence to take place. ""I would argue that maybe the terrestrial planets formed first and then the giant planets just stopped forming when there was no more gas,"" Cauê Borlina , an assistant professor of planetary science at Purdue University, told Live Science. ""After that, it just becomes this chaotic buildup."" Determining a planet's age Scientists are still debating which theory best explains the solar system's formation. But even the way they think about the age of a planet isn't straightforward. ""There are two different ways of thinking about the age of a planet,"" Gaia Stucky de Quay , a planetary scientist at MIT, told Live Science. Instead of dating a planet based on its provenance, some scientists focus their attention on its surface. ""The way I think about ages is more the age of the surface, because surfaces can be really old, like a preserved surface, or surfaces can be really young if stuff is still happening"" like active plate tectonics , Stucky de Quay said. One method scientists use to determine a planet's age is to manually count the craters on its surface. From this perspective, Earth could be considered the youngest planet, as its surface changes continuously, with Venus and Mars coming next, she said. Unfortunately, the limitations of current planetary dating methods mean that scientists can only estimate how old each planet is. And because even a small margin of error can amount to millions of years in the history of the universe , researchers are still working to gather data to piece together a more precise timeline. ""If we ever want to try to get this full picture of how and when planets form, I think samples are a crucial part of that,"" Borlina said. ""And some places are a little bit harder than ours to get samples from, but we have samples sitting on Mars right now just waiting for us to bring them back.""",https://www.livescience.com/space/planets/which-planets-are-the-youngest-and-oldest-in-our-solar-system,Science,livescience.com,,https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/TTYY5NRhFT3GT2QzzXPSYK-1600-80.jpg,2025-10-12T09:00:00+00:00,7e6da93865530e76a7bbc1939ee794b430f96724
3b53a7c37156,"Hidden, supercharged 'thermostat' may cause Earth to overcorrect for climate change",,"Earth may respond to the huge quantities of carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) that humans are pumping into the atmosphere by ""overcorrecting"" the imbalance, which could result in the next ice age arriving on time instead of being delayed by tens of thousands of years, as had previously been predicted. This is due to a newfound ""thermostat"" that buries mountains of carbon beneath the seafloor so efficiently, it could do away with human carbon emissions within 100,000 years, researchers have discovered. That's several times quicker than scientists assumed would happen with a previously described ""lazy thermostat"" that locks away carbon on timescales of 500,000 to 1 million years, the team reported in a study published Sept. 25 in the journal Science . With both thermostats working in tandem, it's possible that the next ice age could start on time, instead of being delayed by the effects of climate change , study co-author Andy Ridgwell , a professor of geology at the University of California, Riverside, told Live Science. The newfound thermostat does not protect humans living now from the effects of global warming, said study co-author Dominik Hülse , a mathematician and biogeochemical modeler at the University of Bremen in Germany. ""It's not to say that we will be safe from global warming in the next 100 or even 1,000 years,"" he told Live Science. Scientists have long suspected that Earth regulates its climate on geological timescales. Since the 1980s, researchers have theorized about a mechanism called the silicate weathering feedback, which occurs when rain captures CO 2 from the air and sprays it onto silicate rocks — rocks with minerals made of oxygen and silicon that constitute about 90% of the planet's crust. CO 2 reacts with these rocks, dissolving them and forming molecules that leach into the ground and eventually end up in the ocean. Once there, what was once CO 2 forms limestone and chalk, meaning it is locked away for millions of years. The silicate weathering feedback is like a thermostat because the more CO 2 that is in the atmosphere, the warmer Earth gets and the more the water cycle intensifies . As precipitation increases, silicate weathering accelerates, meaning more CO 2 is transferred to the ocean and atmospheric CO 2 sinks to background levels again. Get the world’s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox. The feedback also works the other way around. ""If you get too cold and CO 2 is too low, then the thermostat is consuming too little CO 2 compared with a background of constant release of CO 2 from the mantle, from volcanoes and other magma features,"" Ridgwell said. In this scenario, less CO 2 ends up in the ocean and atmospheric levels slowly increase back to average levels, he said. But the silicate weathering feedback moves slowly; it can take up to 1 million years after a perturbation to rebalance CO 2 levels. As a result, there are climate events it can't explain, including Earth's glacial and interglacial cycles, which are characterized by huge fluctuations in CO 2 levels and temperature that occur roughly every 100,000 years, Ridgwell said. Silicate weathering also can't explain snowball Earth events , which completely cover the planet in ice, Hülse said. If silicate weathering were the only thermostat regulating Earth's climate, its smooth balancing act would prevent it from tipping into such extreme conditions, Hülse explained. A second ""thermostat"" The new research was inspired by Hülse's doctoral dissertation , in which he calculated how much organic carbon was preserved in ocean sediments during past climatic events. His results showed that after periods of intense volcanic activity and warming, mountains of organic carbon were deposited onto the seafloor. This finding suggested there might be a link between atmospheric CO 2 levels and organic carbon burial in the ocean. ""There are definitely times in Earth's history when a lot of organic carbon has been deposited,"" Ridgwell said. ""We've sort of known that there must be other things going on [besides silicate weathering], but it's much more complex to put in a model."" But Hülse and Ridgwell tackled this challenge in the new study by amalgamating their individual projects into a single global climate carbon cycle model that accounted for organic carbon burial in the seafloor. Their results revealed a second ""thermostat"" rooted in Earth's phosphorus cycle, which starts on land with rocks containing minerals such as apatite, the researchers said. Weathering of these rocks due to precipitation releases phosphorus, which leaches into the ground, enters streams and rivers, and eventually ends up in the ocean. There, phosphorus is a key nutrient for tiny photosynthetic creatures known as phytoplankton, which use it to fuel cellular processes. When phytoplankton die, they sink to the ocean bottom, where they deposit organic carbon, phosphorus and other nutrients. Phytoplankton take up phosphorus to power cellular processes, and when they die, they bring it with them to the seafloor. (Image credit: Roland Birke/Getty Images) In a warmer world, more phosphorus is washed into the ocean and phytoplankton proliferate, meaning more organic carbon and phosphorus reach the seafloor. However, warmer oceans also hold less oxygen because oxygen becomes less soluble as temperatures increase. This deoxygenation releases deposited phosphorus back into the water column while burying organic carbon in sediments. ""Exactly how that happens is not mechanistically entirely known, but we know it happens,"" Ridgwell said. ""Where we've had these events in the past where we see massive amounts of organic carbon being buried after a warming event, there's very, very, very little phosphorus in that material compared with normal material. If it's not being buried, it must have been returned to the ocean."" As phosphorus gets recycled, it reenters the food chain and phytoplankton continue to proliferate as they feast on phosphorus from both the land and the ocean. This leads to a phytoplankton boom, which sucks more and more CO 2 out of the atmosphere and deposits more and more organic carbon onto the seafloor, which brings down global temperatures. So, the warmer the world gets, the more productive the oceans become and the more carbon is locked away, which cools the climate. But the difference between phosphorus and silicate weathering is that phosphorus in the ocean doesn't decline as soon as Earth cools, because it continues to be released at the seafloor. ""The organic carbon thermostat is a little bit like the silicate thermostat, except it has this supercharger,"" Ridgwell said. ""You end up with so many nutrients in the ocean — and they're being recycled very efficiently — that it's very difficult to get rid of them again."" The phosphorus cycle eventually regains its balance, but the planet can ""overcorrect"" in the meantime, triggering events like snowball Earth, the researchers said. It's unclear how this second thermostat will respond to climate change now, but the ocean is so rich in oxygen compared with in the past that a snowball Earth is unlikely, they said. Instead, it's possible that the organic carbon thermostat will make up for the delay expected for the next ice age. Climate change is disturbing Earth's natural cycles, and previous research suggests it could push back the next glacial period, which is due in about 11,000 years, by tens of thousands of years. But if the organic carbon thermostat activates, atmospheric CO 2 could return to background levels much faster, ensuring that the next ice age arrives on time. ""Whatever delay we'll end up with for the next ice age ... thinking about this mechanism might bring it back forward again,"" Ridgwell said. ""One is going to start at some point for sure; it's all about when it starts.""",https://www.livescience.com/planet-earth/climate-change/hidden-supercharged-thermostat-may-cause-earth-to-overcorrect-for-climate-change,Science,livescience.com,,https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/of4nwAArzCPeXessj5R7yC-2560-80.jpg,2025-10-11T15:00:00+00:00,0ea12f6ae1a2291ba3353a3b389d6899b96c2a4d

The comet, an interstellar interloper from far beyond our solar system , was first spotted in late June. Now, scientists are finally closing in on its age and where it came from . They discovered it likely originated in the far corners of our galaxy and could even be a relic from its earliest beginnings — making it potentially billions of years older than the sun. This discovery was accompanied by other observations, including the comet's unusual properties, with astronomers spotting it spewing water ""like a fire hose"" before it was anywhere close to the sun. Researchers are continuing to keep a close watch on the object, even deploying the European Space Agency 's (ESA) Mars spacecraft to capture the closest view yet of its bright coma . We also reported on astonishing astronomical discoveries made much further afield, including the first radio telescope imaging of two black holes orbiting each other , tentative evidence for controversial dark matter stars and the James Webb Space Telescope proving Einstein right eight times over with the detection of an octet of stunning gravitational lenses. Strange gravity signal inside Earth Researchers detected the anomaly in data from the original GRACE Satellites, which were active between 2002 and 2017. (Image credit: NASA/JPL) In 2007, a gravity anomaly appeared that was as long as the entire continent of Africa , occurring at the same time as a geomagnetic jerk in Earth's gravitational field. The strange anomaly's signal and the jerk lasted for about two years, but it was 18 years before they were discovered inside data collected by satellites studying Earth's gravitational field. Scientists believe the cause was a previously unknown geological process somewhere near Earth's core, likely the result of a rapid redistribution of mass in our planet's deep mantle. Yet more research is needed before scientists can understand these hidden processes and their broader impacts. Get the world’s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.

The hoard dates to the Early Middle Ages and weighs about 13 pounds (6 kilograms), according to a translated statement from the Stockholm County Administrative Board . The worm digger, who found the hoard by his summer house, reported the finding to local government officials. Archaeologists are now examining the treasures, which had been placed in a copper cauldron that has largely degraded over time. ""This is probably one of the largest silver treasures from the early Middle Ages that has been found in Sweden,"" Sofia Andersson, an antiquarian at the County Administrative Board in Stockholm, said in the statement. ""We don't yet know exactly how many coins there are, but I think it could be upwards of twenty thousand."" A preliminary analysis showed that most of the silver coins date to the 12th century. Some bear the text ""KANUTUS,"" the Latin name for Knut, meaning they were minted during the reign of Swedish king Knut Eriksson, who ruled from 1173 to about 1195. A few of the coins are rare, including several ""bishop coins"" that were minted by powerful bishops, according to the statement. These coins depict a bishop holding a crosier, a shepherd's crook that was widely used by clergy as a symbol of their ecclesiastical work.

9e68dfc481b4,Einstein's relativity could rewrite a major rule about what types of planets are habitable,,"The planets around white dwarf stars might provide long-term homes for alien life , but they suffer from a fatal overheating problem. Who's going to rescue them? According to new research, it's none other than Albert Einstein . White dwarfs are the compact remnants of dead sun-like stars. They litter the universe, with the Milky Way alone home to hundreds of millions of them. And because they can stay warm for hundreds of billions of years, they are a very intriguing place to search for life. However, research had suggested that life would probably have a tough time on a planet around a white dwarf. The habitable zone — the region where temperatures are just right to support liquid water on a planetary surface — around white dwarfs spans somewhere from a tenth to a hundredth the distance between Earth and the sun. This is fine, if a bit uncomfortable, but the problem comes when the planet is not alone. If there's another planet in the system even somewhat nearby, its weak-but-persistent gravitational influence will pull the inner world into a highly elliptical orbit. Once there, it will stretch and squeeze from tidal heating. This happens in the icy moons of the outer solar system , which liquefies their interiors. But for a planet around a white dwarf, this same process will heat it up so much that it becomes totally uninhabitable. Previous research had found that this was very easy to do. Even a small deviation from a perfectly circular orbit would be enough to doom a planet. But that research only considered Newtonian gravity, which is the simple formulation of gravity that explains everything from the motion of projectiles on the Earth to the orbits of most of the planets around the sun. But we know that Newtonian gravity is not always accurate, especially for close-in orbits around dense stars. In our own solar system, Mercury's orbit slowly rotates, or precesses, around the sun, in a way that Newtonian gravity cannot explain. A major accomplishment of Einstein's theory of general relativity , which views gravity as the result of deformations in spacetime, was that it could explain Mercury's orbit. In a new paper published Sept. 30 to the preprint database arXiv, researchers performed a more careful analysis of planets orbiting white dwarf stars, accounting for the effects of general relativity. While previous researchers knew that general relativity was more accurate, it’s a much more difficult theory to use, and usually doesn’t produce significant differences in planetary orbit calculations. Get the world’s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox. But the researchers found that a more accurate treatment revealed a much wider window of habitability than previously thought. This is because the precession of the inner planet's orbit ""protects"" it from being pulled into more elliptical paths, which, in turn, prevents runaway tidal heating, the researchers explained. (The paper has not been peer-reviewed yet.) There are some cases where tidal heating is unavoidable, like if a companion planet is too big or too close. But for a wide variety of combinations, the inner planet remains in its orbit just fine. And if an alien civilization ever does develop on a planet like that, these aliens might discover general relativity on their own — and if they do, they can thank that physics for their very existence.",https://www.livescience.com/physics-mathematics/einsteins-relativity-could-rewrite-a-major-rule-about-what-types-of-planets-are-habitable,Science,livescience.com,,https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jr6zNvGmRFe742vYKmnwrc-1920-80.jpg,2025-10-11T10:00:00+00:00,db4b8819869221dca412832381eabf801011f8c4
76ccc05de1d7,China issues new pledge to cut greenhouse gas emissions — is it now a global leader in climate action?,,"In a video statement to the United Nations (UN) in September, China 's President Xi Jinping announced the country's first-ever plan defining set targets to cut its greenhouse gas emissions. The country aims to reduce its emissions by 7% to 10% by 2035, per the new plan. As the world's largest emitter, China has the potential to shape the global fight against climate change. The pledge is remarkable as it is the first time China has set out specific emission-reduction targets. Research indicates that the goals set out are achievable. Proponents argue that China will not fall short — and may even overdeliver — on its commitments. Some have expressed concerns , however, labeling China's nationally determined contribution (NDC) — a country's climate action plan — as insufficient to meet the target of limiting warming to 2.7 degrees Fahrenheit (1.5 degrees Celsius) above pre-industrial levels under the Paris Agreement . Still, many see it as a significant moment in global climate policy . ""China's new climate target is both underwhelming and transformative,"" Andreas Sieber , associate director of policy and campaigns at 350.org, an international environmental NGO, said in a statement . ""Reducing emissions by 7-10% by 2035 from peak levels falls short of what the world needs, yet it anchors the world's largest emitter on a path where clean-tech defines economic leadership."" China, the United States and India were the top emitters in 2024, according to the Emissions Database for Global Atmospheric Research . In 2024, China was responsible for about 29% of global greenhouse gas emissions. In contrast, the U.S. contributed 11.1%, while India contributed 8.2%. At the same time, China is surging ahead in renewable energy, having installed a record of 1,200 GW of wind and solar capacity by the end of 2024 — surpassing the 2030 target set by its National Energy Administration six years early. While coal still dominates China's power generation, these developments suggest the country may be poised to fulfil its new climate goals. So what do you think? Has China's new target positioned it as a true global leader in climate action — or is this promise too little, too late?

b5bac5d88f80,Extreme weather caused more than $100 billion in damage by June — smashing US records,,"The first half of 2025 logged the most damaging extreme weather on record in terms of cost, even after accounting for inflation, data shows. This is partly because of a handful of extraordinary events, such as the Los Angeles wildfires. But the number of natural disasters that struck this winter was also ""exceptional,"" Paul Ullrich , a professor of regional climate modeling at the University of California, Davis, told Live Science. All told, the first half of the year likely incurred $93 billion to $126 billion in damages, half-year estimates from insurance companies Munich Re , AON and Gallagher Re suggest. This total smashes the previous most costly first six months on record, of $57 billion (inflation-adjusted), set in 2023, according to National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration ( NOAA) data . This is part of a larger trend. Natural weather disasters have become more frequent and destructive over the past several decades as a result of climate change and land use changes, and that trend is likely to continue. ""As long as we continue to warm the planet, we can expect extreme weather to grow more severe and more frequent,"" Kristina Dahl , a climate scientist and vice president for science at Climate Central, told Live Science in an email. ""Combine that with our propensity to build communities in areas prone to climate-related hazards — think of the heavily built-up shoreline along the hurricane-prone coast of Florida or of small California communities tucked up against flammable forests — and we can expect the economic cost of those events to continue to rise as well."" So far, these natural disasters haven't led to a dramatic increase in deaths, due in part to advances in weather forecasting and early warning systems that help get people out of harm's way, experts say. But as climate change intensifies, that could change, as some disasters are projected to increase in parts of the U.S., such as floods and regional heat waves, will be more difficult for people to avoid. The Palisade and Eaton fires ripped through highly valuable properties in Los Angeles, contributing to the record-breaking costs. (Image credit: Bloomberg via Getty Images) Record-breaking winter One event this winter caused much of 2025's natural disaster damage — the Los Angeles wildfires. In January, wildfires burned through mostly ""high-value single-family homes"" in Pacific Palisades and Eaton Canyon, Zhiyun Li , a climate economist at UCLA, told Live Science in an email. Together, they are the most costly wildfires in U.S. history — and the costliest in world history. Get the world’s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox. Insurance companies Gallagher Re, Munich Re and AON estimated total damages between $53 billion and $65 billion, taking into account direct losses such as property damage. Other estimates, which factor in property damage, rebuilding costs and capital losses such as impacts on gross domestic product (GDP), and in some cases health care and relocation costs and other factors, range from $76 billion to $275 billion . In comparison, California's entire 2018 wildfire season — the costliest season on record — incurred $30 billion (inflation-adjusted) in damages, according to estimates from NOAA . The LA fires were extraordinarily destructive because they intensified quickly, as a result of strong Santa Ana winds , extremely dry conditions and overgrown vegetation from previous wet years, which dried rapidly. ""We could call it a one-two or a one-two-three punch, leading up to the catastrophic events in January,"" Daniel Swain , a climate scientist at UCLA, told Live Science. And unlike most previous wildfires, these blazes hit expensive, densely populated urban areas. In addition to the California wildfires, a high number of other extreme weather events have occurred across the U.S. — in particular tornadoes . Two tornado events, in March and May, each caused at least $8 billion in insured losses each, according to AON. Floods and winter weather have also caused a lot of damage this year. These have all helped make the first half of the year extremely costly. Costly year in the forecast If hurricane season is bad, 2025 could turn out to be the most expensive in history for weather disaster damage. The most damaging and deadly weather events in the U.S. have been hurricanes, NOAA data show. So far, the Atlantic hurricane season has been quiet— but the season runs through November , and forecasters have predicted an above-average season . Since 1980, tropical cyclones have caused more than $1.5 trillion of damage in the U.S. (inflation-adjusted) — more than all other types of extreme events combined — and have caused 7,211 deaths, more than any other extreme weather type, NOAA data show. One reason hurricanes can be so destructive is that they often make landfall in heavily developed areas. ""One of the most desirable places for building new homes and places to live is the ocean against the shore,"" said Stephen Strader , an associate professor of geography and the environment at Villanova University. ""It is beautiful 99.9% of the time, until the hurricane comes knocking and you end up with a lot of people in very highly exposed areas,"" he told Live Science. Government cuts mean NOAA has stopped publishing data on billion-dollar weather disasters. But overall, if the second half of this year is in line with the five-year average for July to December, the year's total damage cost could be in the ballpark of $220 billion. This would mean $110 billion January through June and $110 billion for July through December. To calculate this number, Live Science took the estimates of the first half of 2025 from Gallagher Re, AON and Munich Re — which NOAA previously said is comparable with its own estimates — and combined the average of those with NOAA's estimates of average damage costs from July through December between 2019 and 2024. Climate change impact The destruction caused by natural disasters has been rising rapidly in recent decades. In 1980, there were just three events that caused more than $1 billion in inflation-adjusted damage and the 1980s in total saw 33 such disasters, according to NOAA data. By comparison, 2024 alone saw 27 inflation-adjusted billion-dollar events, and the 2020s so far have experienced 115 disasters that cost at least $1 billion, not including this year. ""It just seems like every year we have an increasing trend. And it's ticking up and up and up,"" Strader said. Part of this is due to human-caused climate change, which is making extreme weather events increasingly likely and intense . ""We're just going to see more intense storms,"" Ullrich said. ""They're going to intensify more rapidly as they make landfall, and you're going to see larger storm surge associated with them, which is going to affect coastal infrastructure."" ""Any sort of extreme storm, particularly ones producing heavy rainfall , [is] worsened by climate change — that is, they produce more precipitation because of warmer atmospheric conditions,"" Ullrich said. This effect was seen during the Texas flash floods in July, when a large storm dropped about a foot (30 centimeters) of water in just a few hours over the Texas Hill Country, in turn causing the Guadalupe River to rise by more than 26 feet (8 meters) and burst its banks. Flood losses are projected to increase by as much as 147% in Louisiana and 74% in Florida in 2050 relative to 2020's losses, according to Climate Central . Much of this will be driven by climate change, Climate Central found. But it's not just storms that are supercharged by climate change. ""We know that climate change is increasing the frequency and severity of fire weather — the hot, dry, windy conditions that are so conducive to the spreading of fire,"" Dahl said. The rapid transition between wet and dry conditions that fueled the LA blazes also may be worsened by climate change, research suggests . Overall, ""there's abundant and overwhelming evidence that climate change is increasing the severity and likelihood of extreme fire conditions in the American West,"" Swain told Live Science. In July, deadly flash floods left 135 people dead after heavy rainfall caused the Gaudaloupe River to burst its banks. (Image credit: Jim Vondruska via Getty Images) Expanding bull's-eye Land-use changes also contribute to the increased devastation of natural disasters. ""We sort of have this two-headed monster going on in the world, which is our climate is changing; we're having [worse] extreme weather,"" Strader said. At the same time, more people live in the U.S. and on the planet, which increases our exposure, he added. One factor that makes natural disasters more destructive is the expansion of urban areas . In 2017, 3.3% of the entire land area in the U.S. was urban — up from 2.2% in 1982 and just 0.8% in 1949. Population density has also increased, and the urban population has ballooned from 167 million in 1980 to 249 million in 2010 . This means there are more buildings and infrastructure to be destroyed, that weather events are more likely to hit urban areas, and that more people are affected when these areas are hit. Experts have dubbed this the "" expanding bull's-eye effect ."" Strader noted that the expanding bull's-eye effect creates a particular risk for tornadoes. ""We're not really seeing any change in the number of tornadoes,"" and those tornadoes aren't getting stronger, Strader said. Instead, tornadoes are now more damaging because we have built more homes and infrastructure in tornado-prone areas, he noted. In addition, we are modifying the land in ways that make some disasters more likely. Replacing open space with roads, for instance, can worsen flooding. ""If we've modified the environment to have more pavement versus open areas where water can percolate, then we may have increased that urban flood hazard, even if the rain hasn't changed and the size of the city hasn't changed,"" Swain said. Our actions have also worsened the risks of wildfires. In the past, small, low-intensity fires regularly cleared out brush and helped regenerate forests in the American West. But after a century of fire suppression, the wilderness is overgrown. ""There's a deficit of natural, beneficial fires,"" Swain said. This leads to a large buildup of fuel for wildfires, so when one does occur, it burns hotter, grows larger and is more devastating, Swain said. Deaths versus damages Even though natural disasters are becoming more frequent and destructive, more people aren't dying as a result. That's largely because warning systems and forecasting have improved, which, in turn, helps people get to safety in time, experts noted. However, as climate change worsens, forecasting may not prevent a rise in fatalities. ""The two biggest [disaster types] I worry about are heat and flooding,"" Strader said. ""When we have very high heat waves, it affects a huge portion of the country, and heat is something you can't escape from, especially if you're vulnerable"" or if you don't have resources, he added, noting that minority groups are particularly affected. Cities can become like ""concrete ovens"" — and while such extreme weather events may not always cause massive infrastructure damage, they can be as deadly as a massive hurricane or wildfire. For instance, a heat wave in the Midwest in September 1995 killed 872 people and caused $2 billion (inflation-adjusted) in damage, according to NOAA. But 2017's Hurricane Harvey — the second-most-destructive extreme event on record, which hit Texas and Louisiana — caused $160 billion (inflation-adjusted) of damage and just 89 deaths. And government policies could lead to more deaths in the short term, experts said. The government is looking to cut funding and staff headcount at the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), the Forest Service and NOAA . These cuts will likely lead to significant impacts , both in the near future and longer term, experts told Live Science. ""It is actually highly plausible that the cuts that are being done right now … will probably increase disaster losses. It's very much a self-inflicted wound,"" Swain said. ""The savings by cutting these programs are almost certainly to be far less than the costs incurred through greater disaster losses to come as a result of these objectively very short-sighted decisions.""",https://www.livescience.com/planet-earth/climate-change/extreme-weather-caused-more-than-usd100-billion-in-damage-by-june-smashing-us-records,Science,livescience.com,,https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/dtw6DHtdBLcXriBPzWZUEF-1920-80.jpg,2025-10-10T16:57:38+00:00,5014cffe411e899966778edc747e1f9295b9301c
d0c7e5d5eabb,Robots receive major intelligence boost thanks to Google DeepMind's 'thinking AI' — a pair of models that help machines understand the world,,"Google DeepMind has unveiled a pair of artificial intelligence (AI) models that will enable robots to perform complex general tasks and reason in a way that was previously impossible. Earlier this year, the company revealed the first iteration of Gemini Robotics, an AI model based on its Gemini large language model (LLM) — but specialized for robotics. This allowed machines to reason and perform simple tasks in physical spaces. The new models, dubbed Gemini Robotics 1.5 and Gemini Robotics-ER 1.5, greatly expand on the capabilities of the original version to handle multistep, ""long-horizon"" tasks and are a significant milestone towards robots assisting people in real-world use cases. The baseline example Google points to is the banana test. The original AI model was capable of receiving a simple instruction like ""place this banana in the basket,"" and guiding a robotic arm to complete that command. Powered by the two new models, a robot can now take a selection of fruit and sort them into individual containers based on color. In one demonstration, a pair of robotic arms (the company's Aloha 2 robot) accurately sorts a banana, an apple and a lime onto three plates of the appropriate color. Further, the robot explains in natural language what it's doing and why as it performs the task. Gemini Robotics 1.5: Thinking while acting - YouTube Watch On ""We enable it to think,"" said Jie Tan , a senior staff research scientist at DeepMind, in the video. ""It can perceive the environment, think step-by-step and then finish this multistep task. Although this example seems very simple, the idea behind it is really powerful. The same model is going to power more sophisticated humanoid robots to do more complicated daily tasks."" AI-powered robotics of tomorrow While the demonstration may seem simple on the surface, it demonstrates a number of sophisticated capabilities. The robot can spatially locate the fruit and the plates, identify the fruit and the color of all of the objects, match the fruit to the plates according to shared characteristics and provide a natural language output describing its reasoning. Get the world’s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox. It's all possible because of the way the newest iterations of the AI models interact. They work together in much the same way a supervisor and worker do. Google Robotics-ER 1.5 (the ""brain"") is a vision-language model (VLM) that gathers information about a space and the objects located within it, processes natural language commands and can utilize advanced reasoning and tools to send instructions to Google Robotics 1.5 (the ""hands and eyes""), a vision-language-action (VLA) model. Google Robotics 1.5 matches those instructions to its visual understanding of a space and builds a plan before executing them, providing feedback about its processes and reasoning throughout. The two models are more capable than previous versions and can use tools like Google Search to complete tasks. The team demonstrated this capacity by having a researcher ask Aloha to use recycling rules based on her location to sort some objects into compost, recycling and trash bins. The robot recognized that the user was located in San Francisco and found recycling rules on the internet to help it accurately sort trash into the appropriate receptacles. Another advance represented in the new models is the ability to learn (and apply that learning) across multiple robotics systems. DeepMind representatives said in a statement that any learning gleaned across its Aloha 2 robot (the pair of robotics arms), Apollo humanoid robot and bi-arm Franka robot can be applied to any other system due to the generalized way the models learn and evolve. ""General-purpose robots need a deep understanding of the physical world, advanced reasoning, and general and dexterous control,"" the Gemini Robotics Team said in a technical report on the new models. That kind of generalized reasoning means that the models can approach a problem with a broad understanding of physical spaces and interactions and problem-solve accordingly, breaking tasks down into small, individual steps that can be easily executed. This contrasts with earlier approaches, which relied on specialized knowledge that only applied to very specific, narrow situations and individual robots. The scientists provided an additional example of how robots could help in a real-world scenario. They presented an Apollo robot with two bins and asked it to sort clothes by color — with whites going into one bin and other colors into the other. They then added an additional hurdle as the task progressed by moving the clothes and bins around, forcing the robot to reevaluate the physical space and react accordingly, which it managed successfully.",https://www.livescience.com/technology/robotics/robots-receive-major-intelligence-boost-thanks-to-google-deepminds-thinking-ai-a-pair-of-models-that-help-machines-understand-the-world,Science,livescience.com,,https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/dQiA3iqMCPukcRaejD9Skd-1600-80.png,2025-10-10T12:10:00+00:00,7b920d456ccb7901a6a64f5439c27b4597921268
47b1875e1b41,Coral Triangle: The giant hidden 'Amazon' beneath the sea that appears somewhat resilient to climate change,,"QUICK FACTS Name: Coral Triangle Location: Ocean around the Solomon Islands, Papua New Guinea, Timor-Leste, parts of Indonesia and Malaysia, and the Philippines Why it's incredible: The Coral Triangle is home to 76% of known coral species in the world. The Coral Triangle is a tropical marine region between the Pacific and Indian oceans where 76% of Earth's coral species are found. It encompasses 2.3 million square miles (6 million square kilometers) of ocean around the Philippines, Indonesia and Papua New Guinea, and stretches south to Timor-Leste and as far east as the Solomon Islands. Biodiversity in the Coral Triangle is much higher than in other regions with coral reefs, such as the Caribbean Sea and the southwest Pacific Ocean. Around 605 reef-building coral species inhabit the Coral Triangle — 10 times the number in the Caribbean Sea, according to an article from the U.K.'s Natural History Museum (NHM). These corals provide a home for six of the world's seven sea turtle species and 37% of the world's coral reef fish species, as well as marine mammals like dolphins, dugongs, blue whales and sperm whales, according to the NHM article. This incredible array of species has earned the Coral Triangle the nickname the ""Amazon of the sea."" ""This part of the world contains the highest diversity of marine species,"" Nadia Santodomingo , a coral expert and marine biologist at the NHM, said in the article. ""Scientists have been trying to understand why it's so diverse for a very long time."" In fact, British naturalist and explorer Alfred Russel Wallace was working there when Charles Darwin was alive, trying to solve the same problem, she added. Wallace traveled through the Malay Archipelago between mainland Southeast Asia and Australia, collecting specimens and developing theories regarding the region's staggering biodiversity. He came up with what scientists call the ""Wallace Line"" — a gigantic biological boundary that separates the Oriental and Australian faunal regions — and proposed the theory of evolution by natural selection around the same time as Darwin. Scientists today have more tools at their disposal to understand the region, with evidence suggesting that murkier conditions in the Coral Triangle compared with other shallow tropical waters may provide a haven for different species. The Coral Triangle has been a biodiversity hotspot for at least the past 20 million years, and this is partly thanks to a huge variety of habitat types and optimal conditions for larvae that ride on ocean currents, according to the nongovernmental organization Blue Corner Marine Research . Research also suggests that the Coral Triangle has a plethora of species simply because diversity built up over time . Unlike temperate and polar marine regions that have undergone glaciations, tropical regions like the Coral Triangle have remained relatively stable. And what sets this region apart from other tropical seas is its unique, platform-like geology and location at the intersection between two oceans, researchers say . Get the world’s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox. The Coral Triangle is located between the Pacific and Indian oceans. (Image credit: Main_sail/Getty Images) Like other coral reef regions, the Coral Triangle is vulnerable to overfishing, pollution from coastal development, and ocean acidification linked to climate change — although scientists think its murky conditions may shield it somewhat. ""Corals living under continuous sediment stress seem to be more resilient, as the mud may block light, which in turn alleviates bleaching stress induced by high temperatures,"" Kenneth Johnson , a paleobiologist and principal researcher at the NHM, said in the article. Nevertheless, it's important to protect this patch of ocean, Johnson said. ""Nobody really thinks about these reefs,"" he said, ""but they might be the ones we really want to protect.""

606c15417f86,New species of Jurassic 'sword dragon' could help solve an evolutionary mystery,,"A nearly complete fossil skeleton found on the U.K.'s Jurassic Coast represents a newly identified species of ancient marine reptile that lived alongside dinosaurs. The ichthyosaur, dubbed Xiphodracon goldencapsis , was likely around 10 feet (3 meters) long when it lived, according to a study published Friday (Oct. 10) in the journal Papers in Palaeontology . It had large eye sockets and a long, narrow snout shaped like a sword. The specimen dates to a period in the Early Jurassic known as the Pliensbachian, which lasted from about 193 million to 184 million years ago. By studying an ichthyosaur fossil from this period, scientists could learn more about a critical point in these aquatic animals' evolution, according to the study. Fossil collector Chris Moore found the remains in 2001 along the Jurassic Coast, a 96-mile (154 kilometers) stretch of seaboard in Dorset known for being a treasure trove of fossils. Moore sold the fossil to the Royal Ontario Museum in Canada shortly thereafter. Although it was identified as an ichthyosaur, it wasn't studied in detail until recently. ""I remember seeing the skeleton for the first time in 2016,"" study co-author Dean Lomax , a paleontologist at the University of Manchester and the University of Bristol, said in a statement . ""Back then, I knew it was unusual, but I did not expect it to play such a pivotal role in helping to fill a gap in our understanding of a complex faunal turnover during the Pliensbachian."" The ichthyosaur appears to suffered a bite wound to the head by a larger predator, and had malformed bones and teeth indicating serious injury or disease. (Image credit: Dean Lomax, Judy Massare, and Erin Maxwell) The new genus name, Xiphodracon , comes from the Greek words ""xiphos,"" meaning sword, and ""dracon,"" meaning dragon — a reference to ichthyosaurs' ""sea dragons"" nickname. Its species name, ""goldencapsis,"" comes from Golden Cap, the site on the Jurassic Coast where the ichthyosaur was found. Get the world’s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox. The fossil also hints at how the individual ichthyosaur lived and died. ""The limb bones and teeth are malformed in such a way that points to serious injury or disease while the animal was still alive, and the skull appears to have been bitten by a large predator — likely another much larger species of ichthyosaur — giving us a cause of death for this individual,"" study co-author Erin Maxwell , curator of fossil aquatic vertebrates at the State Museum of Natural History Stuttgart in Germany, said in the statement. ""Life in the Mesozoic oceans was a dangerous prospect."" X. goldencapsis could also help to clarify a major shift in ichthyosaur speciation in the early Jurassic. Although scientists have found many ichthyosaur fossils from before and after the Pliensbachian, the two groups have very few species in common, suggesting a major turnover sometime during the Pliensbachian. In fact, ichthyosaur fossils from the Pliensbachian period are rare. The newly discovered ichthyosaur ""is more closely related to species in the later Early Jurassic … and its discovery helps pinpoint when the faunal turnover occurred, being much earlier than expected,"" Lomax said. In other words, the shift likely occurred in the early Pliensbachian. However, scientists don't yet know what caused this upheaval. For now, the X. goldencapsis fossil will be displayed at the Royal Ontario Museum.",https://www.livescience.com/animals/extinct-species/new-species-of-jurassic-sword-dragon-could-help-solve-an-evolutionary-mystery,Science,livescience.com,,https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/xaubTnbRejWWbReoGpTD93-1920-80.jpg,2025-10-10T00:00:00+00:00,a0fe6aaab39f77b381bbf42ee29a372084b7605b
c32a89f00f96,Ancient Roman tombstone found beneath undergrowth in New Orleans yard,,"When clearing undergrowth in their New Orleans yard one day, a married couple discovered something completely unexpected: a Roman headstone that had once marked the grave of a soldier who lived half the world away in the second century. Research into the unlikely object indicates that it is genuine, and its discovery hints at an international mystery that dates back to World War II. "" We get calls from the public about odd finds in yards in the area pretty often,"" University of New Orleans archaeologist D. Ryan Gray , who analyzed the headstone, told Live Science. ""Often it turns out to be something natural that just happens to look like an artifact."" In this case, the homeowners were Daniella Santoro , an anthropologist at Tulane University, and her husband Aaron Lorenz, Gray noted in an Oct. 6 online report about the investigations into the stone. ""When Daniella initially described this, I thought maybe it was a 19th-century gravestone that had been scavenged from a New Orleans cemetery and then discarded,"" Gray said. ""However, as soon as I saw the photo of the inscription, I immediately suspected this was something very different."" Ancient gravestone Santoro had found the unusual marble tablet beneath the undergrowth in the backyard of her ""shotgun"" house in the city's historic Carrollton neighborhood. The stone is about 12 inches (30 centimeters) wide and slightly longer, and one surface is densely chiseled with Roman text. Experts say the Latin inscription can be translated to English and reads: ""To the Spirits of the Dead for Sextus Congenius Verus, soldier of the praetorian fleet Misenensis, from the tribe of the Bessi [of Thrace], (who) lived 42 years (and) served 22 in the military, on the trireme [warship] Asclepius.

Lingering mystery An investigation revealed that the inscription had already been recorded by archaeologists — but on a second-century grave marker found near Civitavecchia, an ancient city and port about 40 miles (64 kilometers) northwest of Rome. That headstone was reported missing after World War II, however, when Allied bombs destroyed the museum that housed it. It's not entirely clear what happened next, but Gray listed a few ideas in his report: maybe a U.S. soldier passing through Civitavecchia after the Allies liberated Rome in 1944 had acquired it as a souvenir; or maybe it was acquired after the war by an antiquities dealer, who then sold it to a tourist, he said. Santoro and Lorenz are now working with authorities in the U.S. and Italy to return the gravestone to Civitavecchia. ""For me, this story reflects a wonderful intersection of a homeowner's curiosity ultimately bringing to light something unexpected and historically significant,"" Gray wrote in his report.

ca8a0cd38dec,200-foot scorpion effigy mound in Mexico may align with the solstices,,"A gigantic scorpion-shaped mound built centuries ago in Mexico may align with the winter and summer solstices, a new study finds. Archaeologists documented the 205-foot-long (62.5 meter) mound in 2014 while surveying prehistoric irrigation systems in Tehuacán Valley, about 160 miles (260 kilometers) southeast of Mexico City. Several artifacts and offerings were found at the scorpion mound, which helped the team date it to the Late Classic and Early Postclassic periods (circa A.D. 600 to 1100). The scorpion effigy mound has remained remarkably intact over the centuries. It has a head, body, pincers and tail sculpted with a mix of dirt and rocks that are piled up to 31 inches (80 centimeters) high. The team found buried artifacts where the ""stinger"" would have been. ""This sort of effigy feature is quite unusual in Mesoamerica,"" the researchers wrote in the study, which was published Aug. 29 in the journal Ancient Mesoamerica . The discovery also suggests that regular Mesoamericans, not just the elite, were looking to the sky and monitoring astronomical events, said study first author James Neely , a professor emeritus of archaeology at the University of Texas at Austin. ""It is the first indication that knowledge and control of astronomical phenomena based on solar observations was not totally in control of the elite class,"" Neely told Live Science in an email. Astronomical observatory The scorpion is one of 12 mounds, which appear to be part of a civic and ceremonial complex that spans about 22 acres (9 hectares) and includes what may be a looted burial or storage pit. This complex may have been used for astronomical observation, helping agricultural workers know when to perform rituals and plant and harvest their crops, the team said. Get the world’s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox. A sketch to scale of the scorpion effigy mound in the Tehuacán Valley of Mexico. (Image credit: Courtesy of Blas Castellón) Some of the mounds have rooms and walls, but only the scorpion has a specific shape, making it an effigy mound — or piled dirt that is purposefully formed into a specific shape, symbol or figure. While thousands of earthen mounds built by Indigenous Americans are found in North America, effigy mounds are ""notably sparce"" in Mesoamerica, making the scorpion one a rare find. The scorpion, known as Tlāhuizcalpantēcuhtli, was a powerful deity in pre-Hispanic Mesoamerica. Many Mesoamerican peoples saw it as a celestial deity and a prominent figure in the Aztec pantheon of gods. To Mesoamericans, Tlāhuizcalpantēcuhtli represented Venus , the morning star planet, the researchers wrote in the study. While studying the scorpion effigy mound, the team noticed that it was oriented east-northeast, a clue that it aligns with sunrise on the summer solstice , they wrote in the paper. To investigate, the researchers calculated the sun ’s trajectory on both the summer and winter solstices. ""We estimate that on the morning of the summer solstice, if a person sighted from the 'stinger' (the circular ceramic cluster at the presumed end of the scorpion’s tail), the sun would rise above the tip of the northern (left) claw,"" they wrote in the study.

(Image credit: Courtesy of Blas Castellón) Archaeologists found a molcajete offering at the scorpion effigy mound. We see (left) the way the artifact was found and (right), the artifact with the cover bowl taken off. The summer solstice was an important ceremonial date in Mesoamerica, as it kicked off the beginning of the rainy and planting season, the researchers noted. ""For the days leading up to the solstice, the sun would rise between the two claws, and thereby signal the approach of the rainy season so the local farmers could prepare their fields for planting,"" the researchers added. Likewise, the sunset on the winter solstice also connected with the scorpion effigy mound. If a person stood at the tip of the left claw, they could see the setting sun beyond the stinger, the team found. ""Based on these estimates, the [scorpion] mound would allow its users to identify the dates of both the summer and winter solstices, common alignments for Mesoamerican architecture,"" the researchers wrote in the study. Among the artifacts found at the scorpion effigy mound were bowls, jars and plate fragments. The archaeologists also found molcajetes — tripod bowls that were used for grinding food — as well as an incense burner and the fragment of a hollow figurine that was likely involved in a ritual, they wrote. The discovery of the mounds and astronomical observatory among the irrigation canals shows the complexity of the Mesoamerican civilization that built them, Neely said, adding that ""this points to the prehistoric campesinos [countryside farmers] having lived a life way of greater independence and self-determination from elite/state control as do their modern counterparts.""",https://www.livescience.com/archaeology/200-foot-scorpion-effigy-mound-in-mexico-may-align-with-the-solstices,Science,livescience.com,,https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/TMQmzkn4XQ8yeTrwV4cVu5-2233-80.jpg,2025-10-09T17:30:00+00:00,8388899cd7bc6bc86df136d35a40a60317ad9ca3
59f21912aeff,"Comet 3I/ATLAS is losing water 'like a fire hose' on full blast, 'rewriting what we thought we knew' about alien star systems",,"The interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS began blasting water ""like a fire hose"" before it was anywhere near the sun, according to a recent study. Researchers observed the comet scattering water unusually early in a discovery that sheds light on how the building blocks of life are distributed across other planetary systems. Initial James Webb Space Telescope observations have suggested that 3I/ATLAS has a high carbon dioxide (CO2) to water (H2O) ratio . In the new study, published Sep. 30 in The Astrophysical Journal Letters , researchers explored water activity on the comet and provided the first clear evidence that it was shedding water while still remarkably far from the sun. ""When we detect water — or even its faint ultraviolet echo, OH — from an interstellar comet, we're reading a note from another planetary system,"" study co-author Dennis Bodewits , a professor of physics at Auburn University in Alabama, said in a statement . ""It tells us that the ingredients for life's chemistry are not unique to our own."" NASA 's Neil Gehrels Swift space observatory detected hydroxyl (OH) gas, an ultraviolet by-product of water, coming off the comet when it was nearly three times farther from the sun than Earth (2.9 astronomical units away), much farther away than the region of our solar system where water ice typically turns to gas on passing comets . Researchers calculated that the comet was shedding about 88 pounds (40 kilograms) of water per second, which is about the equivalent of a fire hose running at full blast, according to the statement released by the researchers. Since its discovery in July, scientists have been using various telescopes to learn all they can about 3I/ATLAS. Their findings so far indicate that the comet is zooming through our solar system at speeds in excess of 130,000 mph (210,000 km/h) in an unusually flat and straight trajectory . Get the world’s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox. 3I/ATLAS is likely the largest interstellar object ever seen , though researchers are still pinning down its exact size. Hubble Space Telescope data suggest that 3I/ATLAS has a maximum width of about 3.5 miles (5.6 km). 3I/ATLAS could also be the oldest comet ever seen , with one study suggesting it's around 3 billion years older than our 4.6 billion-year-old solar system . For the new study, researchers used observations made with the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory's ultraviolet and optical telescope in July and August. The researchers suggested that the ultraviolet hydroxyl signal could be the result of sunlight heating small icy grains on the nucleus (head) of the comet, causing them to vaporize into gas. 3I/ATLAS is only the third interstellar comet ever recorded, following the discovery of the cigar-shaped 1I/'Oumuamua comet in 2017 and the pristine 2I/Borisov comet in 2019. So far, each interstellar visitor has had some differing characteristics, suggesting that there could be a variety of comet and planet-forming environments in the universe.

f36689f0177e,Groundbreaking image shows two black holes orbiting each other for first time,,"For the first time ever, astronomers have imaged two black holes orbiting each other, finally offering visual proof for the existence of black hole pairs. Spotted through the faint fluctuations of radio light captured by telescopes both on the ground and in space, the two black holes are locked in a 12-year orbit some 5 billion light-years from Earth. The smaller black hole was captured with a jet of near-light speed particles twisting around like a rotating garden hose or a dog's wagging tail. The larger black hole, producing a bigger cosmic fountain known as the blazar OJ287, is a supermassive monster with a mass roughly 18 billion times greater than our sun. The researchers published their findings Oct. 9 in The Astrophysical Journal . ""For the first time, we managed to get an image of two black holes circling each other,"" study first author Mauri Valtonen , an astronomer at the University of Turku in Finland, said in a statement . ""In the image, the black holes are identified by the intense particle jets they emit. The black holes themselves are perfectly black, but they can be detected by these particle jets or by the glowing gas surrounding the hole."" Black holes are born from the collapse of giant stars and grow by gorging on gas, dust, stars and other black holes. For some of these gluttonous space-time ruptures, friction causes the material spiraling into their maws to heat up and emit light that telescopes can detect, turning them into so-called active galactic nuclei (AGN). The most extreme AGN are quasars — supermassive black holes billions of times heavier than the sun that shed their gaseous cocoons by shooting out light blasts trillions of times more luminous than the brightest stars. When these jets are pointed toward Earth’s line of sight, they are known as blazars. Astronomers have previously imaged the supermassive giants at the center of our Milky Way and in the nearby galaxy Messier 87 , and ample evidence for black hole binaries and their mergers appears in detections of gravitational waves . Yet despite long-held suspicions that OJ287 contained an orbiting pair, telescopes lacked the resolution to separate them from a single dot. Get the world’s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox. In fact, observations of OJ287 go back before astronomers even knew black holes existed; its semi-periodic flares in intensity were included in late 19th century photographic plates made to study nearby cosmic objects. Revisiting data taken from these plates and in follow-up observations led astronomers to begin speculating in the 1980s that the system's regular dimming and brightening was caused by two orbiting black holes. To arrive at visual proof, the astronomers used a radio image obtained by a network that includes the RadioAstron, or Spektr-R, satellite — a Russian scientific satellite carrying a radio telescope operational from 2011 to 2019. A thereotical diagram (left) showing where the black holes and their jets were at the time of the image, and the radio image (right). (Image credit: Valtonen et al, 2025.) ""The satellite's radio antenna went halfway to the moon, which greatly improved the resolution of the image,"" Valtonen said. ""In recent years, we have only been able to use Earth-based telescopes, where the image resolution is not as good."" Comparing the features in the image to past calculations, the researchers distinguished two components corresponding to the jets of each black hole appearing exactly where the theory suggests they should. Yet some wrinkles remain: The researchers caution that the two jets in the image could overlap, meaning that the possibility can't yet be fully excluded that there is only one.

fa0a7b6d1ed6,Chemo hurts both cancerous and healthy cells. But scientists think nanoparticles could help fix that.,,"When the first cells appeared on Earth approximately 3.8 billion years ago , viruses were already here to greet them . Ever since, viruses have been devising ways to infect cells, and cells have been responding by evolving ways to stop these infections. This evolutionary dance eventually led to the development of your immune system. A key aspect of your immune system is to distinguish ""self"" from ""nonself "" so it can destroy and remove foreign materials from your body. While this immune reaction protects you from viruses , it also has implications for how well foreign materials such as medications work. I am a researcher studying ways to make drugs work better , including how to get them to the site of disease within the body before being removed or destroyed. One way to do this is to encapsulate drugs in nanoparticles — materials small enough to be taken up by cells. While these materials still trigger an immune response to get them out of the body, scientists like me have found that this reaction could actually be used to improve the effectiveness of cancer treatment . The immune system and drug delivery In addition to detecting pathogens, your immune system also responds to tissue damage. You might observe this reaction as inflammation — such as redness and swelling — when drugs are injected into your body with a needle. Typically this inflammatory response is minimal. But the potential for a sustained reaction increases when drugs are administered slowly over a prolonged period of time, such as during chemotherapy infusions that can take an hour or more. For this reason, some patients are given anti-inflammatory medications before infusion to reduce the potential for an adverse immune response during treatment. The most recent breakthroughs in getting drugs into the body is using nanoparticles. These materials — which can be made from lipids, proteins, gold or other components — have the advantage of being very small: The diameter of a typical nanoparticle is about 10-thousandths of a millimeter . Their small size allows diseased cells to easily take them up. So when nanoparticles contain drugs, they can act as a drug delivery system. The Mighty Power of Nanomaterials: Crash Course Engineering #23 - YouTube Watch On Despite being so small, nanoparticles can hold a large number of drug molecules , allowing them to deliver a potent cargo of treatment directly into a cell. They can also deliver drugs made of DNA and RNA . The most well-known example of this technology is the COVID-19 vaccine , which uses nanoparticles made of modified fat molecules to deliver mRNA that teaches the immune system to protect itself against COVID-19 infection. Get the world’s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox. Your innate immune system also identifies nanoparticles as foreign invaders when they are injected into your body. As a result, some patients experience an initial inflammatory reaction when the body tries to attack the nanoparticle. But what if this reaction could actually be used to improve treatment? Exploiting the innate immune response For the past 30 years, my laboratory at the University of Colorado has been studying how nanoparticles deliver drugs. More recently, we have focused on understanding how the innate immune system responds to an injection of nanoparticles. While this immune reaction is typically considered a drawback, we wanted to explore whether it could enhance therapy. In a 2022 study on how nanoparticles affect the immune response in mice, we found that the innate immune response triggered by an initial dose of nanoparticles carrying a drug will also reduce the effects of a second dose if it is injected shortly afterward — typically within days. It does this by clearing the drug out from the body more quickly. This reaction is similar to how an initial viral infection would trigger a short-term protective response against a subsequent infection from another virus. Nanoparticles — the yellow dots — can be designed to home in on cancer cells, which are blue. (Image credit: NIH ) One critical aspect of this protective effect involves the production of a protein called interferon lambda . This molecule ""interferes"" with the infection process by restricting viruses from gaining access to different tissues in the body. Researchers have previously tested this protein as a potential antiviral drug to treat COVID-19 . Similarly, the interferon lambda made in response to the first dose of nanoparticles limits the ability of the second dose to deliver the drug to healthy tissues in the body. However, it did not affect the nanoparticle's ability to access tumors, possibly because tumors can impair the immune response . In conventional cancer treatment, chemotherapy drugs are used to kill the tumor. Because these drugs are also toxic to healthy cells, patients often experience side effects such as hair loss, gastrointestinal problems and skin rashes. Using nanoparticles to deliver cancer treatment could help reduce these side effects, and combining them with interferon lambda could allow the nanoparticle-encapsulated drug to stay in the body long enough to have its full effects. Our team is studying whether directly injecting interferon lambda before chemotherapy with nanoparticles could help limit the amount of drug that ends up in healthy tissues while increasing their concentration in tumors. In an initial test of this strategy in mice with colon cancer, all mice that received interferon lambda saw increased survival time and reduced weight loss. A better understanding of how this effect happens could help researchers eventually test this approach to cancer treatment in human patients. Scientists have a long way to go in developing nanoparticles that are as efficient as viruses at getting into cells. But our hope is that exploiting an immune response that evolved approximately a billion years ago to prevent viral infections could help reduce the toxic side effects from treatment while improving its effectiveness.

4d2773ee1c55,James Webb telescope may have spotted controversial 'dark stars' in the far universe,,"The second most distant object ever spotted by the James Webb telescope may be a 'dark star' powered by dark matter rather than nuclear fusion. By looking at the wavelengths of light picked up by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), researchers have identified four dark star candidates — with one seemingly possessing a “smoking gun” helium absorption signature, the researchers reported in a study published Sept. 30 in the journal PNAS . First hypothesized in 2007, dark stars are believed to be among some of the first stars — called Population III stars — to form after the Big Bang . According to the theory, they are made when collapsing hydrogen and helium, which on their own would form a black hole, mix with dark matter. Dark stars are thought to be extraordinarily massive and bright, reaching one million times the mass of the sun and burning one billion times as bright. ""Our initial name 'dark star' is a misnomer,"" study co-author Katherine Freese , a professor of physics at The University of Texas at Austin who proposed the dark star hypothesis, told Live Science. ""They're neither made [entirely] of dark matter nor are they dark."" Finding dark stars could explain some of the very puzzling objects that JWST has spotted in the early universe, such as the giant supermassive black holes that formed impossibly fast , Freese said. It would also provide insights into the nature of dark matter. ""It's a probe, not just a new kind of star,"" she said, ""so these candidates are very encouraging to us."" To spot the potential dark star candidates, the team trawled through observations from the JWST Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey (JADES). They focused on data collected by the Near InfraRed Spectrograph (NIRSpec): an instrument measuring the individual wavelengths of light coming from celestial objects to learn about their temperatures, masses and chemical fingerprints. The researchers set various criteria in their search: the signals needed to be no younger than redshift 10 (a redward stretching of the universe’s ancient light corresponding to 500 million years after the Big Bang), could only contain hydrogen and helium, and had to be from a single object. Get the world’s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox. This led them to four dark star candidates: JADES-GS-z11-0, JADES-GS-z13-0, JADES-GS-z14-0 and JADES-GS-z14-1. JADES-GS-z14-0 is the second most distant object observed by JWST to date. Signals from the first stars Models of each candidate showed that all four could plausibly be dark stars, perhaps even supermassive dark stars. The team also found hints of the “smoking gun signature” for supermassive dark stars in the JADES-GS-z14-0 wavelength data — singly ionized helium atoms absorbing light particles with a wavelength of 1640 angstroms (an angstrom is one hundred-million times smaller than a centimeter). ""No other known high redshift objects are expected to produce such an absorption feature,"" the authors wrote in the study, adding weight to their suggestion that JADES-GS-z14-0 is a dark star. The team were surprised to discover, however, that the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) in Chile had detected JADES-GS-z14-0 emitting oxygen , an element only produced by nuclear fusion powered stars. ""That worries me a little bit,"" Freese said. The team are now running simulations to determine how much oxygen is permitted before a dark star is no longer able to form, study co-author Cosmin Ilie , a physicist at Colgate University in New York, told Live Science. ""Logic tells me that there should be sort of a transition,"" he said. Dark stars remain controversial and their existence is by no means accepted. ""The majority of the Pop III star community actually doesn't think that dark matter burners [dark stars] can form,"" Daniel Whalen , a cosmologist at the University of Portsmouth in the U.K. who was not involved in the research, told Live Science. In fact, Whalen said that a ""huge issue"" with this research is that it did not differentiate between dark stars and supermassive primordial stars . ""That's the elephant in the room really here,"" he said. Although the dark star candidates are more massive than most supermassive primordial stars, their wavelength data needs to be compared for both star types to rule out supermassive primordial stars, Whalen explained. In response to this criticism, Ilie said that because supermassive primordial stars don't live as long as dark stars, if many suitable signatures are identified they are statistically more likely to be dark stars. That means many more observations are needed to settle this mystery. Meanwhile, Freese said that the team is working on automating the search for dark stars in the JWST data ""so we don't have to do anything except keep our eyes open.""",https://www.livescience.com/space/cosmology/james-webb-telescope-may-have-spotted-controversial-dark-stars-in-the-far-universe,Science,livescience.com,,https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/wnmeHkvAwMTSavjfKJxMjf-1920-80.jpg,2025-10-09T15:49:02+00:00,131ddaf0f04ff5e9a3d062917058a7b93a8d839f
602164c601ec,"Satellites detected strange gravity signal coming from deep within Earth almost 20 years ago, study reveals",,"Satellites detected a strange gravity signal off the coast of Africa nearly 20 years ago, suggesting something unusual had happened deep within the planet to distort its gravitational field, according to a recent study. The large gravitational anomaly lasted for about two years over the eastern Atlantic Ocean. It peaked in January 2007, the same month Steve Jobs announced the first iPhone (though, of course, there was no connection between the two events). Researchers recently discovered the signal while analyzing data collected by the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellites between 2003 and 2015. The gravitational anomaly happened around the same time as a geomagnetic ""jerk"" — an abrupt change in the variation of Earth's magnetic field . The strange anomaly, and the jerk, were caused by a previously unknown geological process, the researchers suspect. Their findings, published Aug. 28 in the journal Geophysical Research Letters , indicated that a shift in minerals may have caused a rapid redistribution of mass in the deep mantle, near the core, altering Earth's magnetic field. Study co-author Mioara Mandea — a geophysicist at the National Centre for Space Studies (CNES) in France and a principal investigator for the European Research Council's Gravimetry, Magnetism, Rotation and Core Flow project — told Live Science that she questioned the validity of the signal at first. ""As is often the case in scientific research, my initial response was one of questioning: is the signal genuine, how can it be validated, and how should it be interpreted?"" Mandea said in an email. ""While the result and its publication were certainly a source of satisfaction, the dominant thought was to consider the next steps and possible implications."" The GRACE satellites were a pair of identical spacecraft operated as part of a joint mission between NASA and the German Aerospace Center (DLR). Scientists used these satellites, which were active from 2002 until they ran out of fuel in 2017, to measure variations in Earth's gravity. The satellites moved in tandem (one behind the other) around Earth, and researchers measured the distance between the two objects to look for any changes that occurred as a result of variation in Earth's gravitational force, according to NASA . Get the world’s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox. Such gravity variations are often caused by variations in the concentration of mass — more mass means more gravity. For example, water currents shift mass around in the ocean, which can lead to localized variations in Earth's gravitational field. In the new study, the researchers scoured GRACE data for anomalous gravity signals that potentially originated deep within Earth, rather than from water shifting on or near the surface. The signal was a north-south-oriented gravity anomaly, stretching about 4,350 miles (7,000 kilometers) — close to the length of the entire African continent — from 2006 to 2008, according to the study. Researchers are still learning about Earth’s deep mantle and the boundary between the rocky layer and our planet’s liquid outer core , but the lower section of the mantle is largely made up of magnesium silicate (MgSiO 3 ). The study authors suggested that the mass redistributions they attributed to the signal occurred as a result of a perovskite to post-perovskite phase transformation in this lower mantle section, whereby the structure of magnesium silicate changed under pressure, shifting mass deep within the Earth. Mandea noted that the main message of the study was that Earth is complex and that different datasets and methods are required to understand its internal processes. ""Earth is a complex system that must be studied using diverse datasets and complementary methods of analysis,"" Mandea said. ""This synergy gives us the opportunity to uncover and better understand hidden processes in the Earth's deep interior.""",https://www.livescience.com/planet-earth/geology/satellites-detected-strange-gravity-signal-coming-from-deep-within-earth-almost-20-years-ago-study-reveals,Science,livescience.com,,https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/DV3iBjP7SFRrGGq9CmtnLS-1440-80.jpg,2025-10-09T12:04:57+00:00,815bd0818dc25a1c517d0074acc98cb8c5eaeeb6

We've searched the web to find deals that are still live, and some of them are actually cheaper than they were during Prime Day.

Our optics writer bought this telescope last year, and has enjoyed many evenings observing Saturn's rings, several of Jupiter's moons and some brighter deep space objects. Comes with two eyepieces, finderscope, counterweights, tripod and EQ mount.

Featured in: Best telescopes , Best beginner telescopes

If you're new to telescopes and want to get a better look at the upcoming supermoons on November 5 and December 4, this Newtonian telescope is a good choice to start your stargazing journey. It's $25 more than it was for Prime Day, but we still think it's a good price.

With the Unistellar Odyssey Pro, you get the intelligence of a smart telescope with the experience of observational astronomy, thanks to the Nikon eyepiece. Just choose a target from the list of visible subjects, and the Odyssey Pro will automatically locate and track it, while you sit back and enjoy the view from either your phone/tablet or through the eyepiece.

These big astronomy binoculars have a whopping 20x magnification for detailed views of the moon, plus a great view of Jupiter's moons, star clusters and some deep-sky objects. They need to be mounted on a tripod, but the payoff is worth it. We gave them 4 stars in our full review .

'Best overall' in Best binoculars for stargazing

We recently conducted a group test of Celestron binoculars, with the Nature DX ED ranking higher than both the standard Nature DX and TrailSeeker models. The ED glass eliminates chromatic aberration entirely, making it excellent for birdwatching, handheld stargazing and general use without breaking the bank. They're $9 more than Prime Day, but they're still an excellent price.

Excellent, budget-friendly binoculars that are surprisingly good for the money. We own the 15x magnification variant, so this 25x will produce even more detailed views of the moon, Jupiter's moons and bright deep-space objects.

These binoculars from Celestron are perfect for sweeping across the night sky without the need for a tripod. The 7x magnification is good for picking out stars you can't see with the naked eye, and the large 50mm objective lenses are ideal for low-light environments. Plus, they're only $36 — it's a no-brainer.

If you want to buy your first camera and jump straight into the full-frame market, the Canon EOS R8 is a fine choice, and it's the exact same price as it was during Prime Day. It produces beautiful images, handles noise well and is lightweight and user-friendly. We think it's one of the best beginner cameras out there, and we gave it 4.5 stars in our review .

If video is important to you alongside stills photography, look no further than the Panasonic LUMIX S5 IIX. This deal includes two lenses, and we awarded the camera 5 out of 5 stars in our full review . Plus, it's exactly the same price it was during Prime Day.

Another star projector to rival the Pococo and Orzorz, it projects real images via discs onto any surface — it's far more than just a pretty space-themed light. Not only is it a great educational tool, but the motor is nearly silent, making it perfect to fall asleep to.

55bbfe4a0b26,Scientists discover gold nanoparticles hidden in spruce tree needles,,"When Burl Ives sang ""Silver and gold decorations, on every Christmas tree"" in ""Rudolph the Red-nosed Reindeer,"" he surely didn't know that Christmas trees actually have gold inside their needles — but that's exactly what new research has found. A study published Aug. 28 in the journal Environmental Microbiome reports that Norway spruce trees ( Picea abies ) concentrate gold nanoparticles with the help of their resident bacteria. ""Our results suggest that bacteria and other microbes living inside plants may influence the accumulation of gold in trees,"" lead study author Kaisa Lehosmaa , an ecologist at the University of Oulu in Finland, said in a statement . These resident bacteria are known as endophytes — symbiotic microorganisms that facilitate hormone production and nutrient absorption, among other functions. In the spruce trees, these bacteria segregate soluble gold particles that the trees take up in water through their roots. The process is a form of biomineralization, in which living things control the formation of minerals in their tissues through a wide array of processes. In this case, the endophytes likely concentrated the particles to reduce their toxicity. Striking gold For the study, the researchers investigated spruce trees near the Kittilä mine in northern Finland — the largest producer of gold in Europe. The researchers examined 138 needle samples from 23 spruce trees. Needles from four of the trees contained gold nanoparticles. The nanoparticles were surrounded by biofilms created by bacterial genera such as P3OB-42 , Cutibacterium and Corynebacterium . These films are polysaccharide (complex sugars) and protein compounds secreted by the bacteria that allow them to persist within the plant tissues. Get the world’s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox. The close association between the nanoparticles and bacterial biofilms indicated that the bacteria were likely responsible for isolating the mineral. The diversity of bacterial species was lower in needles that contained gold; other studies of plants with high concentrations of metals in their tissues have also found decreased microbial biodiversity. No one will be making a fortune by cutting down spruces to distill the tiny amounts of gold in their needles — the particles measure a mere millionth of a millimeter. However, the trees' uptake of the valuable mineral by the trees may be a useful indicator of gold deposits under the surface.

The finds date to a time when many people were converting from paganism to Christianity in Poland. ""We view these people as representatives of the 'first Christians' in these lands,"" Justyna Marchewka-Długońska , a researcher at Cardinal Stefan Wyszyński University in Warsaw and a member of the research team, told Live Science in an email. The archaeologists noted that even though people were converting from paganism to Christianity, they still placed grave goods in their burials — a practice that was more commonly done among pagans. The team found the remains of arrowheads, a battle ax, knife blades, rings and carnelian (a reddish semiprecious stone) beads with the bodies. Although some media outlets have claimed this discovery is a mass burial containing warriors who served Mieszko I — a duke of Poland who reigned from about 960 to 992, united the country and created an independent state — the researchers we spoke with said these claims are inaccurate. Instead, they said, the people were buried in single graves within a cemetery. While all of the burials seem to date to around the time of Mieszko I, it's not clear what connection, if any, these people had to him. ""Historically, we do not yet know whether we can discuss any connections at all,"" Marchewka-Długońska said.

Plus, walking treadmills tend to be lighter and more portable, and typically cost less than the 'regular' treadmills designed for speedwork and endurance runs. The best part? Now that the Prime Day sale is coming to an end, you can get one of these clever machines at an even lower price.

To start with, it is not a good pick for sprinters or taller individuals. This treadmill is best suited for walking and light jogging, and that is because its speed is limited to 6.2 mph (10 km/h).

6001370d4fea,Las Vegas Aces offseason outlook: How can A'ja Wilson and Becky Hammon build on third title in four years?,,"The Las Vegas Aces are once again WNBA champions. That statement would have sounded very reasonable back in May, prior to the 2025 season, but absurd in early August when the Aces were stuck in eighth place and had just been dismantled by 53 points by the Minnesota Lynx . That embarrassing defeat -- the second-largest in WNBA history -- proved to be the catalyst for the most remarkable late-season turnaround the league has ever seen. The Aces won their final 16 games of the regular season to finish 30-14 and earn the No. 2 seed in the playoffs via a tiebreaker over the Atlanta Dream . Their 16-game winning streak is tied for the second-longest in WNBA history. Despite the Aces' success down the stretch, the playoffs were not a walk in the park. They blew Game 2 of their first-round series with the Seattle Storm , and were behind in Game 3 at home as the clock ticked under 20 seconds. Only Jackie Young's late putback and a missed jumper from Skylar Diggins on the other end prevented a first-round exit. The Aces appeared to catch a major break when the Indiana Fever upset the Dream in the first round, and they were major favorites against the shorthanded Fever in their semifinal series. However, on the day that A'ja Wilson was presented her record fourth MVP trophy, the Aces were stunned at home in Game 1. They bounced back to win Games 2 and 3 handily, but dropped Game 4 on the road, which set up a deciding Game 5 back in Las Vegas. The Aces were expected to cruise, especially after Kelsey Mitchell left the game in the third quarter, but they ended up needing overtime to advance to the Finals. The Aces' inconsistent play in the first two rounds created some doubts heading into the Finals, and they nearly lost Game 1 at home again, but escaped when Alyssa Thomas missed two late free throws. They dominated Game 2, and were in full control of Game 3 through the first three quarters, but coughed up a 17-point lead in the fourth. Wilson saved the day, however, with a last-second jumper to give them a 3-0 lead. In Game 4, they were cruising again until the Mercury embarked on another comeback attempt. This time, the Aces stemmed the tide earlier and did not need any late heroics to complete the sweep. By defeating the Mercury, and winning their third title in the last four years, the Aces officially became a WNBA dynasty. This was not their best team or most impressive run, but they came up with the plays they needed in every single big moment, which is the true mark of a championship team. ""Obviously we want to win more, we want to hang more banners, but I think this year let us know that ... no journey's the same, but you can still get the same result if you buy in,"" Wilson said during her exit interview. ""You saw that in us this year more than ever. We were questioning if we were gonna make the playoffs. I've never in my mind, in this time under Becky Hammon , have I ever been like, 'OK, if we make the playoffs we can be in good shape.' And that was me this year. I was like, 'if we can just make the playoffs, we're good.' I think our next level is understanding that, yes, they're gonna look different, but you can get the same results if you just really buy in and put your mind to it."" Next season, the Aces will have a chance to hang another banner and become the first team in league history to have two separate repeats. But first, Wilson, Hammon and the Aces' front office will have to navigate the most consequential offseason in league history. Where do Aces rank among WNBA's all-time teams? A definitive history and ranking of the league's dynasties Jack Maloney Season at a glance Record: 30-14 (No. 2 seed) Offensive rating: 105.9 (4th) Defensive rating: 101.9 (8th) Net rating: plus-3.9 (5th) Biggest strength Having A'ja Wilson Wilson, who won her fourth MVP and third Defensive Player of the Year award this season, is the best player in the world and a game-changer on both sides of the ball for the Aces. Here mere presence is Las Vegas' biggest advantage. As we saw in the Finals, when Wilson averaged 28.5 points, 11.8 rebounds, four assists, one steal and two blocks and hit the game-winner in Game 3, opponents often have no answer for her. Biggest weakness Depth The Aces' decision to shift Jewell Loyd to a reserve role boosted many of their official ""bench"" stats, because she still played starter-level minutes. However, they once again had real depth issues all season long. Wilson and Young scored 45.2% of their points in the regular season and 53.3% of their points in the playoffs. Come playoff time, Hammon really only trusted six players. While they were still able to win the title anyway, that's an area they'll have to address in the offseason. Key free agents This will be the most unique free agency period (and offseason) in WNBA history. Only two players not on rookie scale deals -- Kalani Brown and Lexie Brown -- are under contract for 2026. Every other veteran maneuvered to become a free agent this winter with an eye on a massive pay raise whenever the new collective bargaining agreement is ratified. The Aces, who have relied more heavily on veterans than most teams, are nearly a blank slate for 2026. The only player under contract is 2025 second-round Aaliyah Nye , and her deal is non-guaranteed. She showed some nice flashes as a rookie, so the Aces will almost certainly keep her, but if they wanted to, they could completely clear the books this winter. Wilson will, of course, be the team's main priority, but that should be a fairly straightforward negotiation. The Aces will obviously want to re-sign her and she has made it clear time and again that she wants to retire with the organization. ""I don't want to,"" Wilson said in February, when asked if she would ever play for another WNBA team. ""That's more of a front-office question, but Vegas will forever be my home. I was their first draft pick ever of the franchise, so they really brought me in. And the things that we've done -- straight out the gate, we set the standard for the league to follow, and we put a lot of other franchises in the league on their heels. If I could retire an Ace, I would love to. I don't see myself putting on any different jersey."" Likewise, it's very difficult to imagine Young and Gray moving elsewhere. Neither they nor the team would have any reason to break up their partnership. Loyd had a frustrating season overall, but was awesome in the Finals. The team will likely want to bring her back, but she's not going to be their highest earner like she was this season. As for some of their bench pieces, it's easy to see Evans and Smith returning. Evans shot the lights out in the playoffs and Smith played a major role in their midseason turnaround. Plus, they gave up a 2027 first-round pick for Smith, so they are going to let her walk this winter. It would not be a surprise to see some significant turnover with the rest of the roster. Depth has been a major issue for the Aces in recent years, and this is their first chance to really reset. Relying on Wilson and Young as much as they did this season is unsustainable, especially with Gray and Loyd (assuming they stay) getting older. Until the new CBA is in place and we know the rules for free agency, as well as key numbers such as the 2026 salary cap and the new maximum, minimum and rookie salaries, it's too difficult to predict exactly what the Aces will do to fill out their roster, but they should be an attractive free agent destination coming off yet another title. Draft outlook The Aces sent their 2026 first-round pick to the Seattle Storm as part of the three-team deal that sent Kelsey Plum to the Los Angeles Sparks and brought back Loyd. As a result, their only selections this year are their second- and third-round picks at Nos. 29 and 44. While the Aces will still do their due diligence, late second- and third-round picks rarely even make rosters, let alone become contributors, especially on contenders. This year's draft will pretty much be a write-off for the Aces, at least in terms of 2026 impact. With their late picks, they could look at some draft-and-stash options to potentially boost their talent pool down the line.",https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/news/las-vegas-aces-offseason-outlook-how-can-aja-wilson-and-becky-hammon-build-on-third-title-in-four-years,Sport,cbssports.com,,https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2025/10/15/1afbe817-785b-41cb-a0f2-f9ef31b63f36/thumbnail/1200x675/f26029cba75db33ca62983365a753738/untitled-design-64.png,2025-10-15T17:18:44+00:00,2545e341d96504fb7492ac3faf7e1f010344990e
bd03559bd2a0,"2026 WNBA championship odds: Why Fever are nearly co-favorites, Valkyries an interesting long shot",,"The 2025 WNBA season came to a close last week when the Las Vegas Aces completed a four-game sweep of the Phoenix Mercury in the Finals -- the league's first ever best-of-seven series  -- to win their third title in the last four years. While much remains up in the air about the 2026 season, it's never too early to start thinking about next season. The 2026 title odds have been released by Caesars , and to no surprise, the Aces have been installed as co-favorites alongside the Minnesota Lynx , who were the top seed in the 2025 playoffs. The Indiana Fever are just behind those two at +340. Here are the odds for all 15 teams, including the two expansion clubs that will join next season, the Portland Fire and Toronto Tempo. 2026 WNBA title odds This will be the most consequential offseason in league history. First and foremost, the Women's National Basketball Players Association and the WNBA are still negotiating a new collective bargaining agreement, which is expected to bring substantial raises for all players, and perhaps a new economic model. As a result, nearly every veteran will be a free agent this winter. Kalani Brown and Lexie Brown are the only players not on rookie-scale deals who are under contract for 2026. There will also be a double expansion draft at some point, which will allow the Fire and Tempo to fill out their initial rosters. The date and exact rules for that event will not be known until the new CBA is in place, but however the process works, it will have a major impact on all of the current teams. Add in the draft and potential trades, and there figures to be more player movement than ever this winter. Rosters around the league could look substantially different, which makes it tricky to analyze the 2026 title odds in any serious depth at this point. Still, it's worth making note of a few things here. Should the Aces actually be the favorites? Except in rare circumstances, such as a star player retiring, the reigning champions in every sport are always the early favorites for the next season. Repeats are quite rare, though, and the Aces had a unique season. So while it's not a surprise to see them atop this list, it's fair to wonder if they should actually be the favorites. On the one hand, A'ja Wilson , the reigning MVP, co-Defensive Player of the Year and Finals MVP, will almost surely be back. Jackie Young and Chelsea Gray will probably return to Vegas as well, and they have an excellent coach in Becky Hammon and a supportive ownership group. They'll also have a chance to reset their depth after really struggling in that department for a few seasons. However, they weren't super convincing en route to their title. They were below .500 after the mid-point of the season, needed a last-second basket from Jackie Young in the deciding Game 3 of the first round to sneak past the Seattle Storm, were taken to overtime in the winner-take-all Game 5 of the semifinals by an extremely shorthanded Indiana Fever team and had some harrowing moments in the Finals against the Mercury. As long as Wilson, Young and Gray are back, the Aces are going to be in the mix next season, but it doesn't make sense to bet them at this number after the season they just had. Why the Fever are nearly co-favorites The Fever showed incredible resilience to get within five minutes of the Finals despite losing five players, including Caitlin Clark , to season-ending injuries. They upset the Atlanta Dream in the first round of the playoffs, then forced the Aces to overtime in the deciding Game 5 of the semifinals. They are just behind the Aces and Minnesota Lynx in the 2026 title odds, and at +340 are nearly co-favorites. Why? The Fever's youth is a major advantage this offseason. While you'd expect many stars to return to their current teams in free agency, nothing is guaranteed. But because Clark and Aliyah Boston are still on rookie scale deals, the Fever are guaranteed to return two of their best players. No other team has as much talent under contract for 2026 If the Fever are able to re-sign Kelsey Mitchell , they'll have a terrific Big Three. They also have a top coach in Stephanie White, a rabid fanbase and an ownership group that is all in. They should be an attractive destination for free agents this winter and could easily have one of the best rosters in the league in 2026. The Fever's outsized popularity is another factor here. Just like the Los Angeles Lakers, New York Yankees and Dallas Cowboys in their respective sports, the sportsbooks know that more people are going to bet on the Fever than any other team, so they have to price their odds accordingly to avoid a massive liability. Are the Liberty being disrespected? The Liberty got off to a 9-0 start in 2025, but had major injury problems the rest of the way and were eliminated in the first round of the playoffs by the Mercury. A few days after their season-ending loss, they parted ways with long-time coach Sandy Brondello less than a year after she led them to the title. The Liberty currently do not have a coach, and their best players are all free agents. Still, it's a bit surprising that they have the fourth-best odds at +500. Their Big Three of Breanna Stewart , Sabrina Ionescu and Jonquel Jones have all expressed interest in returning. The Liberty had a plus-21.2 net rating when those three were on the floor together this season and they went 13-0 in games they all started and finished. If those three do indeed return to Brooklyn, the Liberty are going to be a contender regardless of what happens with their coaching search and the rest of their roster. Betting on the title before free agency is obviously a risk, but you likely won't be able to get the Liberty at this number next spring. Valkyries are an interesting long shot There were a lot of questions about the Valkyries' direction after their expansion draft last year, but they nailed every decision they've made, both on and off the court. They went 23-21 last season to earn the No. 8 seed and become the first expansion team to make the playoffs in their inaugural season. Natalie Nakase was named Coach of the Year, Veronica Burton was named Most Improved Player and they set WNBA records for average (18,064) and total (397.408) attendance. While they were eliminated in the first round of the playoffs by the Lynx, they walked off the court with their heads held high. No one knows what the Valkyries' roster is going to look like in 2026, but they've built an incredible infrastructure and have one of the most forward-thinking, aggressive ownership groups. Notably, during the press conference to officially announce the team back in 2023, Joe Lacob proclaimed that they would win a title within five years. Could they do so as soon as 2026? The sportsbooks clearly don't think so, as they've given them the eighth-best odds at +3500. With respect to Burton, the Valkyries do not have a true star player in place, which is the main reason for the title skepticism. They have an electric homecourt advantage, a great coach and play in the Bay Area, though, so it's well within the realm of possibility that they add some big names in free agency this winter. That makes them an interesting long shot right now.",https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/news/2026-wnba-championship-odds-why-fever-are-nearly-co-favorites-valkyries-an-interesting-long-shot,Sport,cbssports.com,,https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2025/10/15/86d27cc5-20b0-4556-a228-145a177bea5d/thumbnail/1200x675/7559be04f23c4ad2a240da67f45f5e05/untitled-design-63.png,2025-10-15T17:12:42+00:00,2e3548627775a18d9577414ba41408458177b6cb
e6d03e1ba5c7,"WNBA coaching tracker: Fire hire Alex Sarama, per report; Liberty fire Sandy Brondello one year after title",,"The first WNBA coaching vacancy has reportedly been filled. The expansion Portland Fire will hire Alex Sarama as their first coach, according to Annie Costabile of Front Office Sports. Sarama is currently an assistant coach with the NBA's Cleveland Cavaliers, and previously worked with the Portland Trail Blazers' G League affiliate. Prior to the Fire's reported hire, the only previous moves this fall had been firings. The Dallas Wings let go of Chris Koclanes on after just one year in charge, while the Seattle Storm and New York Liberty parted ways with Noelle Quinn and Sandy Brondello, respectively. Quinn's departure was expected. The Storm only won one playoff series since she took over in 2021 and she was investigated last offseason for alleged bullying and harassment. Likewise, it was not all that surprising to see Koclanes relieved of his duties. He went 10-34 in his first season in charge of the Wings and did not seem cut out for the job. The Liberty's decision to part ways with Brondello just one year after she led the franchise to its first championship, on the other hand, came as a shock to many. It's unlikely we'll see any further coaching changes this winter. Seven teams changed coaches last offseason, and if you count Natalie Nakase with the expansion Golden State Valkyries , eight coaches started new jobs. One, Koclanes, has already been fired, and the only other one who could be in trouble is Tyler Marsh, who went 10-34 with the Chicago Sky . However, if the Sky were going to move on from Marsh, they likely would have done so by now. Chicago Sky offseason outlook: What's next for Angel Reese and Co. after a disastrous 2025 campaign Jack Maloney Of the five teams that entered the 2025 season with established coaches, the Storm and Liberty have made changes. The Las Vegas Aces and Phoenix Mercury made it to the Finals, and Becky Hammon and Nate Tibbets have excellent job security. As does Cheryl Reeve, despite the Minnesota Lynx's early exit from the playoffs. There are still four open jobs. In addition to the Wings, Liberty and Storm, the Toronto Tempo -- the other expansion team entering the league next season alongside the Fire -- still needs to make a hire.

His lone season with the Wings was a disaster. He never seemed comfortable in charge, and the Wings finished in last place at 10-34 and set the league's single-season losses record. By the end of the season, fans were chanting ""We want Nola!"" during games, asking for the team to replace Koclanes with assistant Nola Henry. The Wings will now search for their third coach in as many years. In: TBD Liberty Out: Sandy Brondello Brondello had a very successful tenure in charge of the Liberty. Over her four seasons in charge, the team went 107-53, won a franchise-record 32 games in both 2023 and 2024, never missed the playoffs and made two Finals appearances. In 2024, she led the Liberty to the first championship in franchise history and in 2023 she helped capture the Commissioner's Cup title. Ultimately, those accomplishments were overshadowed by a disappointing 2025 campaign. The Liberty were beset by injuries, finished in fifth place and were bounced in the first round of the playoffs by the Mercury. In: TBD Liberty coaching search: Top potential candidates to replace Sandy Brondello after New York's stunning move Jack Maloney Fire Out: N/A In: Alex Sarama Sarama, who was born in England, has a fascinating résumé.

He also founded Transforming Basketball in 2023, which is ""widely regarded as a globally-leading resource in basketball coach education,"" and is a leading proponent of Constraints Led Approach or CLA, an innovative training technique. He was very highly regarded with the Cavaliers, but whether he works out as a head coach remains to be seen. Portland Fire coaching hire: WNBA expansion team to hire Alex Sarama from Cleveland Cavaliers, per report Jack Maloney Storm Out: Noelle Quinn Quinn, who won a championship with the Storm as a player, joined the Seattle coaching staff as an assistant in 2019 immediately upon her retirement. In 2021, she was elevated to head coach after Dan Hughes stepped down due to health reasons. While she led the Storm to four playoff appearances, they won only one series despite an abundance of talent and never finished higher than sixth in the league in offensive rating. Furthermore, Quinn was investigated for alleged bullying and harassment of players. A second consecutive first-round exit in 2025 was the final straw.

bd37d0d5419d,"DP World Tour India Championship 2025: Rory McIlroy, Tommy Fleetwood, Viktor Hovland headline strong field",,"It's the middle of October, the Ryder Cup is two weeks in the past and players are still flocking to this week's India Championship on the DP World Tour. Taking place at the Delhi Golf Club in New Delhi, the India Championship welcomes some of the most notable names in the game to its grounds, giving golf fans in the country a close look at some of the best players in the world. The $4 million event is the penultimate tournament in the lead-up to the DP World Tour's playoffs and the fourth different tournament to be held in India on the European circuit since 2008. While there have been stars to arrive in the past, perhaps none as big as Rory McIlroy, who comes with the career grand slam in tow. ""It's a significant moment because you're going to have a Hall of Famer -- he's a future Hall of Famer for sure. He's here, he's embracing this event in our country, and the scene is perfect,"" Anirban Lahiri said of McIlroy. ""We're playing DGC; it's a historic golf course. I'm very happy to be here, to be a part of it. ""I think it's great for golf that we have such big worldwide names, stars, all the kids of the next generation idolize and gravitate towards, and I think it's very important in creating that next batch of champions. I think it's a great sign. I hope more stars like him continue to come in the future, and whatever I can do to support it, whether it's by playing and being here or by helping bring people to organize it, I'll be happy to do my bit."" In addition to McIlroy, European Ryder Cup team members Shane Lowry, Tommy Fleetwood and Viktor Hovland as well as headman Luke Donald plan to tee it up at the diabolically tight Delhi GC. On the American side of things, former Champion Golfer of the Year Brian Harman is in the field alongside world No. 12 Ben Griffin and recent French Open winner and social media sensation Michael Kim. The Power 18 golf rankings: Xander Schauffele returns to top five, Cameron Young among most notable movers Patrick McDonald Experiencing a different style of golf and a completely different culture, some of the names above have been adamant about using golf as a vehicle for travel and seeing the sights and sounds the world has to offer. In doing so, they not only expand their horizons but expand the knowledge and access to the game of those who reside in India and will be on site to take in the affairs this week. ""It's amazing. 2007 or 2008 was the last time we had such a big event. Ernie Els came and we had a host of stars,"" Shubhankar Sharma said. ""Since then the Indian Open mostly has been very big. But to have such a big event in India, the DP World India Championship now, I hope that it continues for many years now, and to have all these players come here, it's amazing. ""It's quite surreal because I see them all the time, but it's in Europe, in America, and I know most of these guys. I was on the flight with Shane [Lowry]; he was sitting right next to me. But to see them in my country on a golf course which is, to us Indian players, iconic is amazing. I am really happy. I'm really thankful to DP World for making this event come true. You need such events in India. With a growing golf population, it only helps to grow the sport. I'm really looking forward to it."" Here are a few other reasons why the India Championship on the DP World Tour means so much this week: Grand slam arrival While Scottie Scheffler may be the world No. 1, there may be no bigger superstar in the game than McIlroy right now. With the green jacket and Ryder Cup in his possession along with the game that will make fans ooh and aah, the five-time major champion will play in India for the first time in his career. It could not have come at a better time for those who will be in attendance given McIlroy's stature in the game and his consistent voicing that more tournaments like the India Championship will be on his horizon as priorities shift later in his career. ""I would say as time goes on, my schedule will get hopefully more international. Because that's what I've enjoyed doing. I've always said that,"" McIlroy said. ""But I think over the last few years, I've enjoyed it even more. I've enjoyed the travel. I've enjoyed getting to play in front of people that I've never played in front of before. ""But it does, it fits really nicely. You know, because there is -- I'll always go back and play The Irish Open and Wentworth in September, and then you sort of have especially in non-Ryder Cup years, you've got some choices to make where you want to play, how much do you want to play, do you want to take some time off. But this event certainly fits into a nice part of the year."" Hovland's return to action While McIlroy will draw most of the eyes -- and rightfully so -- Hovland has turned into a bit of a fan favorite in recent years as well. Open and honest about the state of his game through the valleys and peaks professional golf takes players on, the Norwegian returns to play this week after missing the final two sessions of the Ryder Cup due to a neck injury. ""At the end of the day, the course doesn't care where you're from, but at the end of the day, if you're from India, you might… just feel more comfortable, everything is more familiar,"" Hovland said. ""I think a lot of guys, it's a long way to travel, a little jet lag, it's hot out there, it's a very challenging golf course being so narrow and different grass types and all of that. I'm sure the natives here will feel a little bit more comfortable, but at the end of the day you've got to hit the shots and make the putts, so we'll see how it goes."" Some American blood While international players make it a habit to travel around the world and play in various golf tournaments, those from the States seldom do. Beholden to their schedules and routines that pit them in the heat of the PGA Tour schedule for eight months and utilizing the remainder of the year for the offseason, U.S. players are often content with sticking to what they know. That is not the case for both Harman and Griffin, who make their tournament debuts this week. To Harman's credit, the left hander has added a couple more international stops to his schedule since raising the Claret Jug in 2023. He played in the Dubai Desert Classic on the DP World Tour and in Macao on the Asian Tour in 2024. ""Holding a great big trophy is an experience I'd like to have in India,"" Harman said. Meanwhile, Griffin told CBS Sports this past summer that he planned to play in more international events this fall. No longer forced to play in the FedEx Cup Fall to retain his PGA Tour playing privileges and qualify for the next season's signature events, the two-time winner this season is taking full advantage of the flexibility good golf grants players. ""I eat a lot of Indian food in America,"" Griffin said. ""I was pretty excited to come here and experience Indian food in India. That's the biggest thing in my mind. ""In America, I eat definitely a lot of different curries, a lot of different Thai food, as well. But what comes to mind the most is probably eat a lot of korma dishes in America, a lot of masala dishes, paratha. So it's fun to come over here and get to experience the true Indian food."" European Ryder Cup lore A fourth of the European Ryder Cup team in McIlroy, Fleetwood, Hovland and Lowry have made the trip to India as well as captain Donald. Outside of a couple other names on that team in Bethpage Black, the India Championship would be hard pressed to select more popular, affable and fan friendly players from that squad. The rare road win only heightens the anticipation and excitement around these players and so much to the tournament as a whole. And it is safe to say they will receive much warmer welcomes in India than they did in the United States, which can only help the mood. ""Obviously the last few years has been a lot of Ryder Cup and especially the last few weeks,"" Donald said. ""What we did in New York was amazing, but yeah, back to the day job now a little bit, and excited to be here in India for the first time. I've traveled around the world quite a lot with golf but never been to India. When I had the opportunity to come, it seemed like a great opportunity, a couple weeks after the Ryder Cup, to come experience this wonderful country.""",https://www.cbssports.com/golf/news/dp-world-tour-india-championship-2025-rory-mcilroy-tommy-fleetwood-viktor-hovland-headline-strong-field,Sport,cbssports.com,,https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2025/10/15/f12e8db4-8cb9-458b-9d7a-d82d9cc1b380/thumbnail/1200x675/6f7b752ed18de225ec64be4d07f0778c/rory-mcilroy-india-presser.jpg,2025-10-15T17:04:21+00:00,2a41292e125bbc2464d498000ce2c10323737425
a855ab4858f7,"Anthony Volpe injury: Yankees shortstop undergoes shoulder surgery to repair torn labrum, per report",,"Getty Images New York Yankees shortstop Anthony Volpe underwent surgery Tuesday to repair a torn labrum in his left shoulder, according to Joel Sherman and Greg Joyce of the New York Post . The Yankees have not issued an exact timetable on Volpe's return, but he is expected to be ready for Opening Day 2026 barring an unforeseen complication during his rehab. Volpe's shoulder was a storyline throughout the season. He underwent imaging in early May after he experienced a ""pop"" on a fielding attempt . He never required a stint on the injured list, yet the Yankees revealed in September that he had reaggravated the shoulder on occasion -- and that he received a cortisone injection for maintenance purposes during the July All-Star break. ""I feel like he's been in a good spot physically,"" manager Aaron Boone said in September when asked if Volpe's shoulder injury had impacted his play. ""I think everybody deals with certain things, so it's impossible to say like this affected something this much or didn't at all. I don't how you can possibly know that, but I don't think it's been a major factor in his performance, or his ability to swing the bat, or his ability to go to the post every day. That's my sense."" While it's anyone's guess as to how much Volpe was or wasn't impacted by the shoulder, it's worth noting that he had posted a .768 OPS through the May 3 game in which he experienced the pop. From that point forward, he tallied a .632 OPS. Overall, Volpe batted .212/.272/.391 with 19 home runs and 18 stolen bases in 153 games this season. His 83 OPS+ was a tick below the 84 mark he posted over his first two years in the majors. His contributions were nonetheless estimated to have been worth 1.7 Wins Above Replacement.",https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/news/anthony-volpe-injury-yankees-shortstop-undergoes-shoulder-surgery-to-repair-torn-labrum-per-report,Sport,cbssports.com,,https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2025/10/15/e1eec766-55e7-4f21-9673-440f7e6402b1/thumbnail/1200x675/281ad2e84eb1ec9c1b31e62a860ba804/volpe.jpg,2025-10-15T17:02:11+00:00,3d9178cabe33ef8576d22716e75bd3ed5754679a
5331bd177195,Fantasy Football Week 7 Start 'Em & Sit 'Em Quarterbacks: Maye to continue showing top-5 upside vs. Titans,,"Imagn Images Jalen Hurts and the Eagles are struggling in reality, but thankfully, his Fantasy production has been fine. You should still start Hurts with confidence in all leagues in Week 7 at Minnesota. Philadelphia has lost consecutive games against Denver and the Giants , but Hurts has still scored at least 22.6 Fantasy points in each outing. And, for the season, he only has one game with fewer than 22.6 Fantasy points, which was Week 2 at Kansas City. The Vikings are No. 3 in fewest Fantasy points allowed to opposing quarterbacks, and only Caleb Williams in Week 1 and Dillon Gabriel in Week 5 have scored at least 20 Fantasy points against this defense. But Minnesota's other opponents have been Michael Penix Jr. , Jake Browning , and Aaron Rodgers , which has led to their lofty ranking. Hurts last played against the Vikings in Week 2 in 2023 and scored 27.2 Fantasy points, and I'm hopeful he can have a repeat performance in this game. It might not be pretty how Hurts is getting his production, but Fantasy managers are still getting rewarded with quality production, which is all that matters on the scoreboard.

fc96cbd99036,The Buyout Bubble: Why college football keeps paying millions to make coaches disappear,"james franklin buyout, largest buyouts in college football, how buyouts work","The cost of doing business in college athletics has never been higher, and athletic departments are more keen than ever to spend record amounts to hire and fire football coaches amid uncertain economic times. Coaching salaries have exploded, buyouts have gone nuclear and ""guaranteed money"" has become the sport's favorite word over the last decade, leading to a rise in fully guaranteed contracts for coaches, even though most never sniff the end of their multi-year contracts before being shoved out the door ""without cause"" for the unforgivable sin of losing. Meanwhile, the enterprise is buckling due to the introduction of revenue-sharing with players this fall (upwards of $20.5 million) and increasing expenses. At what point does the well dry up? ""Even though the math doesn't seem to math,"" said one search-firm executive who helps programs find coaches, ""athletic departments always find a way. And until they stop keeping score or people stop caring, I guess they'll find a way to do it."" The latest firing sent shockwaves across the industry: Penn State coach James Franklin, gone just nine months after steering the Nittany Lions to the playoffs . His parting gift of $49 million ranks as the second-largest buyout in college football history. His replacement could carry a hefty pricetag, too. Big-time college athletics has always been a zero-sum hustle. They spend as much as they earn -- and many spend more than they bring in. Twenty-two athletic departments cleared at least $150 million last year, and many barely broke even. Thirteen head coaches are set to make at least $9 million this season , nine of them crossing the $10 million mark. Most of their contracts guarantee at least 85% of the remaining money on their multi-year deals if they're fired, with some deals stretching as far as 10 years. Sound insane? It is. ""In theory, there's more incentive to not win games and then get fired, so you don't have to come to work anymore. That's so backwards,"" an executive at a search firm assisting schools told CBS Sports. Like the sport itself, college football's coaching economy is a distinctly American creation -- part capitalism, part fantasy football . ""Winning is the only thing that really matters in college sports, and for that reason, college sports is the only industry in America where the cost of doing business defies every rule of sound business management and financial stewardship,"" said prominent sports attorney Tom Mars, who once sued a school seeking buyout money for a coach. ""There is no limit to what wealthy donors will donate to college sports programs; and coaches and their agents hold all the cards when a school becomes fixated on hiring them."" Emotions have replaced business sense, and powerful agents know it. They've weaponized fear of losing a coach, of falling behind to drive the market skyward. Texas A&M set the modern standard for excess when boosters lured Jimbo Fisher from Florida State and, terrified he then might bolt for LSU, handed him a fully guaranteed 10-year contract. By the time A&M fired Fisher, he was paid the largest buyout in college football history: $76.8 million. ""ADs answer to the president, the president answers to the board and the donors are always involved at these schools,"" said Chad Chatlos, managing director for TurnkeyZRG, a firm assisting college coaching searches. ""Sometimes the wrong people are influencing the process to extend or let go of a coach. I give the agents a lot of credit.  They have created a sense of fear around the potential of having a coach leave."" For athletic directors, one bad hire can end a career. Reputation is the currency. That's why, as one search-firm executive put it, ""It's not the president or board's money. If a president, board and AD make an elite hire that turns the program around, no matter what it costs, that's going to help the public's perception of their ability to do their jobs."" Said an ACC athletics director: ""I'm not sure schools have that much bargaining power if they identify somebody they really, really want that gets everybody excited. The agents know it, the coach knows it and they're going to try to get as much guaranteed money as they can."" Rising costs haven't yet slowed the money train, but the introduction of revenue sharing and schools paying record buyouts to change coaches this season could reset how contracts are negotiated. Still, many in the industry have their doubts. Thirteen coaches across the Power Four would pocket at least $50 million if they were fired today. Four of them -- Kirby Smart, Dabo Swinney, Dan Lanning and Curt Cignetti -- have fully guaranteed contracts. What happens when those same coaches leave for another job? The schools get pennies on the dollar. Smart would owe Georgia just $5 million. Cignetti, a rumored Penn State target, only $10 million after Dec. 1. College football head coach salary rankings: Overpaid, underpaid and Kirby Smart's gobsmacking buyout David Cobb There's also the buyout money schools owe to multiple assistant coaches, which could eclipse eight figures. Athletics director Pat Kraft hints Penn State's next deal will look different because of the changing landscape of NIL and revenue sharing, but with rich boosters propping up the program, they're better positioned than others. ""When all these contracts were signed, the use of the money going to rev share and all the other pieces that are involved (were not in place),"" Kraft said. ""You have to process the financials in such a different light. ""And so, quite honestly, when you get into a search and start to have those hard conversations: What do you envision this program? How do you envision the program looking? How do you envision winning a national championship? I mean, the facts are the facts. You've got to recruit at a high level. And now the transfer portal – you have to be able to recruit in the transfer portal at a high level. So how do you use your resources in the right way, building a roster that can compete for a national championship?"" One potential tweak could be to implement more incentive-based contracts for coaches across college football, especially for programs aiming to invest more into revenue sharing and NIL contracts to attract top-tier players. Perhaps shorter terms with higher yearly salaries are an option, sources told CBS Sports. ""So many people in this industry don't want to be the first to adapt because if they're wrong, then they're fired,"" an agent who represents college coaches told CBS Sports. ""ADs and people in this industry make decisions for many different reasons, and quite often it's not based on merit."" How did we get here? Slowly, and then all at once. The first fully guaranteed contract is believed to have been signed in 2007, when Texas A&M hired Mike Sherman and signed him to a deal worth $12.6 million over seven years. Ten years later, the Aggies pushed the envelope again with Fisher's initial 10-year deal worth $75 million, which increased again in 2021. Michigan State normalized fully guaranteed contracts in November 2021, when it renewed then-coach Mel Tucker with a 10-year deal worth $95 million. At the time, it was the third-largest contract ever. ""That was an inflection point because around the league you looked at the coaches who had already been successful and they're like, 'Whoa, wait a minute!'"" a Big Ten athletics director told CBS Sports. ""It just reset the whole market."" That same month, Penn State signed Franklin to a new 10-year deal, similar to Tucker's structure at Michigan State, despite holding a 7-4 record heading into the final week of the regular season. The market was reset. 🏈 💰Most Expensive Buyouts (as of Dec. 1, 2025) 1 Kirby Smart Georgia $105.1 million (100% of salary through 2028; 85% after 2028) $5 million 2 Lincoln Riley USC $80+ million* N/A 3 Ryan Day Ohio State $70.9 million (92%) $6 million 4 Mario Cristobal Miami $61 million* N/A 5 Kalen DeBoer Alabama $60.8 million (90%) $4 million 6 Steve Sarkisian Texas $60.3 million (85%) $6 million 7 Dabo Swinney Clemson $60 million (100%) $3 million 8 Mike Norvell Florida State $58.67 million (85%) — 9 Dan Lanning Oregon $56.73 million (100%) $20 million 10 Curt Cignetti Indiana $56.7 million (100%) $10 million *Reported figure; contract not publicly available from private university. The past paves the future Five years ago, the coaching carousel seemed destined to stall. College sports were in turmoil. A pandemic gutted budgets, canceled seasons and shuttered some Olympic sports. Luckily, college football kept many athletic departments afloat. As a shortened season kicked off in the fall, it was believed most head coaches would be given a mulligan amid the strangest and most challenging season in the sport's history. ""I remember talking to people and thinking there's not going to be any changes because there's no money,"" an executive with a search firm told CBS Sports. ""Then South Carolina fired Will Muschamp and paid him $15 million or whatever it was. Everybody was like, 'Well, shoot, if they can figure out how to do it, I guess we can, too.'"" And just like that, the dam broke again. Muschamp was fired in mid-November at a price tag of $12.9 million. Auburn handed Gus Malzahn $21.4 million, which was then the largest buyout in college football history (it now ranks third). If a pandemic couldn't stop the money machine, maybe revenue sharing will. But history says otherwise. ""I have said for years that I thought coaches' contracts would level out,"" a Big Ten athletics director said. ""And I've been dead wrong. They continue to go in the other direction. I don't want to say it's laughable, but I guess it kinda is. We've got the good aspects of pro sports in terms of big money, but we've got all the negatives that pro sports don't have. There are no guardrails."" 🏈 💰Most Expensive Buyouts in College Football History 1 Jimbo Fisher Texas A&M $76.8 million 2 James Franklin Penn State $49 million 3 Gus Malzahn Auburn $21.4 million 4 Charlie Weis Notre Dame $18.9 million 5 Willie Taggart Florida State $18 million 6 Ed Orgeron LSU $16.9 million 7 Tom Allen Indiana $15.5 million 8 Tom Herman Texas $15.4 million 9 Bryan Harsin Auburn $15.3 million 10 Art Briles Baylor $15.1 million The power agents still dictate the terms Behind the curtain, agents pull the levers. Names like Jimmy Sexton and Trace Armstrong dominate the carousel, orchestrating bidding wars that leave ADs playing checkers against grandmasters. ""There's not another industry that has 30 jobs open at the same time with similar candidates. That's where the leverage comes from,"" a search firm executive said. ""There's urgency to make a hire, there's an overlap in candidates and four or five agents control 80% of the market."" Hidden costs lurk behind every coaching change. There's the five- or six-figure fee to hire a search firm, a ballooning salary pool for assistants and the inevitable construction of new support staff, all adding layers to an already bloated operation. Then come the buyouts nobody talks about. Sitting head coaches often owe money to their former schools, but those checks are usually covered, directly or indirectly, by the new employer. Some even come with interest attached. When a contract requires a coach to pay the school himself, the new school typically floats the cash and tacks on roughly 30% more to cover taxes, turning a buyout into a fully financed handoff, an executive told CBS Sports. (Miami paid Mario Cristobal $14.9 million to offset his $9 million buyout at Oregon in 2022). As of mid-October, six major programs are officially in the market for a new head coach. More are expected to join them in what insiders believe could be a record-setting carousel. Many schools quietly make in-season moves by hiring search firms, charting candidates, and running mock scenarios to gain an early jump before rivals can strike. ""There are schools out there that know they're firing someone but they just haven't done it yet,"" one search firm executive said. ""You live in fear, but you're preparing right now because you don't want to get to the end of the season and you don't have a really good idea of where you could go and where you're sitting. It's a big chess game, and it's difficult."" That chess game, though, may finally hit a breaking point. With NIL and revenue-sharing costs climbing, some administrators whisper about pulling the reins on runaway buyouts, but few believe it will stick.

Aaron Rodgers, the oldest player in the NFL and turning 42 in December, starts for the Steelers, with Joe Flacco, who turns 41 in January, making his second start at quarterback for the Bengals. Both quarterbacks are at the final stages of their careers, but they look to bring their teams to another postseason run this fall. Kickoff from Paycor Stadium in Cincinnati, Ohio, is set for 8:15 p.m. ET. The Steelers are 5.5-point favorites, according to the latest Bengals vs. Steelers odds, while the over/under for total points scored is 42.5.

Steelers vs. Bengals betting preview, picks Steelers (-5.5) vs. Bengals The Bengals traded for Joe Flacco in hopes of an offensive spark, but after being shut out in the first half and scoring only seven points over the first three quarters against the Packers, the Cincinnati offense continued to struggle under the veteran. The Bengals made a push in the fourth quarter, but the Packers never trailed and controlled the entire contest in their 27-18 victory. Flacco averaged just 4.9 yards per attempt for the game. Meanwhile, the Steelers enter on a three-game winning streak after a 23-9 win over the Browns last week. Aaron Rodgers completed 21 of 30 passes (70%) for 235 yards and two touchdowns against the Browns, and he's completed 68.8% of his passes with 10 touchdowns compared to three interceptions this season. The Bengals are 30th in scoring defense (30.5 ppg) this season, while allowing the second-most yards (394.2 per game) in the NFL. The model projects the Steelers to cover the spread in 56% of simulations. Over 42.5 points Although it took until the fourth quarter, the Bengals did start to move the ball more efficiently late as Flacco and receivers such as Ja'Marr Chase and Tee Higgins formed their on-field chemistry on the fly, and that's something that could bode well for the Over heading into Thursday Night Football. Chase finished with 10 receptions for 94 yards and a touchdown on 12 targets as the veteran quarterback made a point to hyper-target the team's top pass-catcher. Meanwhile, Rodgers' presence has led to offensive stability in Pittsburgh, with the Steelers scoring more than 20 points in four of five games this season. They are 14th in the league in scoring at 23.8 ppg this season after ranking 20th at 21.9 ppg last year. However, the best predictor of this Over is the Bengals having one of the worst defenses in the NFL. Cincinnati has allowed at least 27 points in all five games this season, leading the model to project the Over to hit in 58% of simulations.

b80ce75fb169,"Samoa Joe reacts to AJ Styles and John Cena retiring, WWE Crown Jewel tribute: 'It's incredibly cool'",,"John Cena and AJ Styles dug deep into their pasts at WWE Crown Jewel. Their match, a high point of the show, saw them use signature moves from past rivals, including Samoa Joe, someone who has a rich history with both superstars. At Crown Jewel , Styles snatched a Coquina Clutch, Joe's longtime rear-naked choke submission move. It was a nod from Styles to his legendary TNA rival, one of many dedicated to professional wrestlers who were cornerstones for the company's Spike TV era. ""It's incredibly cool,"" Joe told CBS Sports before challenging ""Hangman"" Adam Page for the AEW world championship at Saturday's WrestleDream pay-per-view. ""Both those men are people I have unyielding respect for. I'm so happy to see they've enjoyed the successes they have had in their life. It was wonderful to be thought of in their big moment."" Joe also has a deeply personal connection to Cena, despite never wrestling each other on WWE television. They started wrestling around the same time, training and performing in the now-defunct California-based Ultimate Pro Wrestling (UPW) promotion. Joe recounted how Cena and Frankie Kazarian once cleaned out his father's fridge, each consuming six pounds of chicken breasts in an impromptu eating challenge. Cena vs. Styles, their fifth and final encounter, was a memorable stop on Cena's ongoing retirement tour. The 17-time world champion will retire at WWE Saturday Night's Main Event on Dec. 13. Styles recently confirmed that he'd retire from in-ring competition next year. While Joe, who confirmed he'd likely retire whenever his current AEW deal expires, sympathizes with fans who are sad to see the legends go, he's happy that his longtime friends are winding down. ""AJ is one of the few wrestlers who changed the face of wrestling. He's definitely the prototype of an ideal wrestler and expanded that category,"" Joe said. ""Much like John, both had fantastic careers. I know for many fans it's sad to see them go, and I can obviously see why. They've been such a big part of the industry for so long. ""For me, it's a bit of a different perspective. I'm super happy for them both. These are both men who've achieved in this industry. They really have careers they can kick back their feet and look at with tremendous pride and satisfaction. I'm always happy to see people enter that phase of their life in a healthy manner with great future prospects of other things on the horizon.""",https://www.cbssports.com/wwe/news/samoa-joe-reacts-to-aj-styles-and-john-cena-retiring-wwe-crown-jewel-tribute-its-incredibly-cool,Sport,cbssports.com,,https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2025/10/15/38d1e847-c6a5-4a04-821f-71a234133c54/thumbnail/1200x675/47f54a8c05ca7ccb3a330c20b7909981/john-cena-aj-styles-wwe-crown-jewel-cbs-sports-pro-wrestling-news-today-samoa-joe-aew-wrestledream-oct-15-2025-v1.jpg,2025-10-15T16:32:16+00:00,405206cb4b68e21450ac713f3033a1832bad8147

The most recent catastrophe was the Aaron Rodgers experiment, which failed miserably but fortunately lasted only two years. There was a bit of optimism entering the 2025 NFL season as New York called upon a star player from yesteryear to help guide it to greener pastures, hiring three-time Pro-Bowl cornerback Aaron Glenn to be its head coach following his successful stint as the Detroit Lions ' defensive coordinator. The Jets then signed the gifted but maligned Justin Fields to be their quarterback under Glenn, whom the team selected with the 12th overall pick in the 1994 NFL Draft . Neither decision has worked out favorably for New York thus far. It enters Week 7 as the only winless team in the league, Fields has done nothing to prove why he should be a No. 1 QB and Glenn has made a number of questionable decisions, doing little to dispel the thought that he may be overmatched. With the 0-6 Jets set to host the Carolina Panthers in Week 7, many fans likely are hoping the team continues to lose and winds up with the first overall pick in the 2026 NFL Draft. The only time the club has had the top selection was in 1996, when it drafted USC wide receiver Keyshawn Johnson. He lasted only four seasons with New York before being traded to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers , with whom he won a Super Bowl in 2002. The Jets had the inside track for the No. 1 pick in 2021, as they lost their first 13 games of the 2020 season. However, they then posted back-to-back victories against the Los Angeles Rams and Cleveland Browns and finished with a 2-14 record, allowing the Jacksonville Jaguars -- who followed a season-opening win with a 15-game losing streak -- to overtake them for the right to take Clemson quarterback Trevor Lawrence with the top selection. One victory could do significant damage to New York's chances for the No. 1 pick in 2026, as five teams enter Week 7 with a 1-5 record and four more are sitting at 2-4. The Jets still have five of those nine clubs on their schedule, so things still could swing in their favor. However, SportsLine's Inside the Lines team and its projection model doesn't see New York selecting first in the 2026 NFL Draft. But the ITL team's model, which simulates every NFL game 10,000 times, feels the Jets' chances to be one of the first three teams to step up to the podium in Pittsburgh next April are strong. According to the ITL team's model, the Jets will finish with more than four victories this season, while the Titans won't reach that mark and will have the No. 1 draft pick for the second straight year and fourth time in franchise history. This past April, Tennessee selected Miami QB Cam Ward first overall, but the 23-year-old has recorded more than 225 passing yards just once in his first six games and has yet to throw multiple touchdown passes in a contest while being sacked an NFL-high 25 times. The Jets opened as 2.5-point favorites in their matchup against the Panthers at several sportsbooks despite last week's 13-11 loss in London to the Broncos in which Fields was sacked nine times and the team finished with -10 passing yards. But they now are 1.5-point underdogs versus Carolina, which has won back-to-back games and three of its last four but is 0-3 on the road this season. According to the model, the Jets finally will get into the win column, as they defeat the Panthers in 56% of simulations. It is predicting a 24-21 victory for the club, which visits Cincinnati in Week 8 before giving its fans a break with what feels like a much-needed bye week.",https://www.cbssports.com/betting/news/nfl-predictions-jets-beaten-out-for-no-1-overall-pick-coin-flip-for-a-top-three-selection,Sport,cbssports.com,,https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2025/09/26/d6431ac3-c889-45d3-8551-01a6a08a4f22/thumbnail/1200x675/edcacfb9db0d91353b634b4ab24bf140/jets.jpg,2025-10-15T16:31:27+00:00,0d7459ee4e202663ebaad639d0d968d9d06b372b
6a28c0dce49f,Kings sign Russell Westbrook: Former league MVP heads to seventh different team for 2025-26 season,"russell westbrook, sacramento kings, kings sign russell westbrook","Imagn Images The Sacramento Kings are signing free agent point guard Russell Westbrook , his agent told ESPN's Shams Charania . Details of the deal weren't immediately reported, but the expectation is that Westbrook is signing for his veteran minimum to help bolster Sacramento's backcourt rotation. Westbrook, 36, will be playing his 18th NBA season for his seventh different team after spending the 2024-25 campaign with the Denver Nuggets . Since Westbrook was traded from the Oklahoma City Thunder to the Houston Rockets in 2019, the former league MVP has been on five different teams: the Rockets, Washington Wizards , Los Angeles Lakers , Los Angeles Clippers and the Nuggets. The Kings will be Westbrook's fourth different team since the start of the 2022-23 season. With Westbrook going to Sacramento, he will provide point guard depth to a team that entered the offseason without a true player at the position on the roster. The Kings signed free agent point guard Dennis Schröder to a three-year deal earlier this offseason but had strong interest in Westbrook dating back to the opening of free agency in July. Westbrook appeared in 75 games and made 36 starts last season for Denver, averaging 13.3 points, 6.1 assists and 4.9 rebounds in 27.9 minutes per game. He finished seventh in Sixth Man of the Year voting for the second consecutive year. Sacramento entered the offseason with a logjam in the backcourt with Keon Ellis , Malik Monk , DeMar DeRozan , Zach LaVine , Devin Carter and new first-round rookie Nique Clifford .

603ea77e22b8,"College Football QB Power Rankings: USC's Jayden Maiava surges, Arch Manning returns to top 50","qb power rankings, college football best qbs, ncaaf best qbs, 2026 nfl draft quarterback class","It's been a long road for Arch Manning , but Texas ' redshirt sophomore quarterback is finally back in the top 50 of the college football quarterback power rankings after doing his part in the Longhorns' rivalry win over Oklahoma . Manning began the season at No. 4 but immediately dropped out after Week 1 and had not been back in the QBPR until now. The former five-star prospect has a long way to go in order to meet expectations, but the Oklahoma game was a step in the right direction. Texas' defense led the way, and Manning managed the game proficiently by keeping the football out of harm's way while completing 21 of 27 throws. Manning was nails on third downs, extending drives and keeping the football away from Oklahoma. The Longhorns converted four third-down plays on the opening drive of the second half, capped by a third-and-8 touchdown strike from Manning to DeAndre Moore Jr . Manning's mobility also came in handy, as he skirted the Oklahoma pass rush all game delivered a couple of pivotal runs in the second half. No one is racing to put Manning's name back in the Heisman conversation, and he's only barely back in the top 50 this week. But the signs of progress are there as Texas heads into a manageable two-week stretch of SEC road games against Kentucky and Mississippi State . Simpson was diabolically clutch in a game-defining fourth quarter drive during Alabama's 27-24 win at Missouri . First, he dropped a 29-yard dime into the tiniest of windows along the sideline on a fourth-and-8 play to extend the possession. Then, he capped it with a 1-yard touchdown strike on fourth-and-goal from the Mizzou 1-yard line. The redshirt junior is completing 71% of his passes with 16 touchdowns and one interception for the season. Last week: 1 What was most impressive about Mendoza's performance in Indiana's 30-20 win at Oregon was how he responded to adversity. After throwing a pick-six early in the fourth quarter that tied the score, Mendoza promptly led two scoring drives, including a 12-play touchdown march that featured three third-down completions. Last week: 5 King pulled his usual stunts in a 35-20 win over Virginia Tech by completing 20 of 24 passes and totaling three touchdowns. Naturally, two of them were on the ground, which makes King the ACC leader in rushing touchdowns at nine. That's especially impressive considering he missed Georgia Tech's Week 2 game. Saturday's showdown at Duke is another showcase opportunity for one of college football's grittiest winners. Last week: 4 Maiava ranks No. 3 nationally in passing yards per game at 308.7 and leads the Big Ten in yards per attempt at 10.8. He was great against a talented Michigan defense in USC's big win over the Wolverines last week, as he completed 25 of 32 passes. Maiava is officially looking like Lincoln Riley's latest great success at QB. Last week: 15 It's a bit surprising that Sayin's odds of winning the Heisman Trophy are just +1800 at FanDuel Sportsbook considering he's a highly effective quarterback for the nation's top-ranked team. Sayin's 19 for 27 showing in a win at Illinois last week wasn't his best. But the Buckeyes didn't need a heroic performance. The redshirt freshman leads the country in completion percentage at 78.4% and has thrown 15 touchdowns against just three interceptions. Last week: 2 Brown played a starring role in South Florida's 63-36 obliteration of North Texas last week, as he racked up five touchdowns for the second week in a row. He's a physical runner with the deep-ball accuracy to run Alex Golesh's veer-and-shoot system to perfection. Last week: 12 Perhaps some were ready to dismiss Williams because he didn't light up Ohio State in Week 5. But who is lighting up the Buckeyes? The sophomore is third nationally in completion percentage at 74.1%, fourth in the Big Ten in passing yards (1,628) and has thrown 10 touchdowns with just one interception. Oh, and he can run, too. Williams totaled 538 yards in a run over Rutgers last week as Washington improved to 5-1 entering this week's test at Michigan. Last week: 27 Carr surpassed 340 passing yards for the second time this season in Notre Dame's 36-7 win over NC State last week. The redshirt freshman is a budding star who is orchestrating the Fighting Irish's best passing attack in many years. He's got a huge opportunity this week against USC. Last week: 14 Sorsby's incredible rebound from a dismal Week 1 performance against Nebraska continued with yet another multi-touchdown performance last week. The veteran Indiana transfer tossed a pair of TDs in a win over UCF to mark his fifth straight game with two or more passing touchdowns. Last week: 10 Robertson leads the nation in passing touchdowns with 19 and in passing yards per game at 343. He's already surprised 2,000 yards through the air and could reach 4,000. Upcoming quarterback duels with TCU's Josh Hoover and Cincinnati's Brendan Sorsby could be high-scoring affairs. Last week: 8 11. Darian Mesnah, Duke Mensah has somewhat quietly established himself as the top passer in the ACC, which makes this Saturday's tilt against No. 12 Georgia Tech all the more interesting. It's a major showdown in the ACC title race, and it pits Mensah's arm against the all-around grit of Yellow Jackets quarterback Haynes King. Last week: 13 Beck holds a narrow edge in the Heisman Trophy voting odds (+300 at FanDuel Sportsbook) over Alabama's Ty Simpson (+320). The Georgia transfer has returned from elbow surgery looking much more like the 2023 version of himself, which is exactly what Miami was hoping for. Last week: 12 Chambliss and the Ole Miss offense weren't quite as sharp as you might have expected against Washington State last week. With games at Georgia and at Oklahoma on tap the next two weeks, Chambliss will have to show he can handle the rigors of road football in the SEC. The Division II transfer has been a revelation, but his four starts have all been at home. Last week: 3 After totaling five interceptions over his previous three games, Aguilar took care of the football in Tennessee's 34-31 win over Arkansas . As a result, the Volunteers won the turnover battle 3-0 and built enough separation to withstand a late charge from the Razorbacks. Aguilar now leads the SEC in passing yards at 1,680. Last week: 16 Few players needed a bye week as badly as Pavia, who takes as many shots as any quarterback in the country. That's par for the course, considering that he's Vanderbilt's leading rusher and the focal point of the offense. Pavia has guided the Commodores to a 5-1 start with his dual-threat ability and high-intensity leadership. Last week: 17 16. Josh Hoover, TCU Hoover still ranks No. 2 nationally in passing yards per game at 315.5 and third in touchdowns with 18. But turnovers are becoming an issue. He had both a lateral and an interception returned for a touchdown in TCU's 41-28 loss at Kansas State . A later interception wasn't his fault, but the first two were particularly costly. Last week: 7 Dampier attempted a meager 12 passes in Utah's 42-10 beatdown of Arizona State last week. But he totaled 120 yards rushing and three touchdowns on the ground as the Utes earned a comfortable victory. Now comes the all-important rivalry showdown with BYU in what is a ranked battle between two programs starting new quarterbacks. Last week: 18 Mateer's return from hand surgery went disastrously, as he threw three interceptions and was hounded by the Texas defense. The Washington State transfer, if healthy enough to be effective, has proven to be a game-changer for Oklahoma. But the Texas loss was a significant hiccup entering a brutal portion of the schedule. Last week: unranked (injury) Considering Daniels was under pressure all game, he played decently well in Kansas' loss at Texas Tech last week. The sixth-year senior is now up to 18 touchdowns with just two interceptions on the season and has the Jayhawks two victories away from returning to a bowl game. Last week: 20 Heintschel was ranked a three-star prospect and the No. 43 quarterback in the Class of 2025. But the once-overlooked player is now shining in the spotlight after leading Pitt to a 34-31 win at Florida State . It was his second straight start and second straight 300+ yard passing performance. The Panthers appear to have found a gem. Last week: 34 21. Luke Altmyer , Illinois Last week: 9 22. Sam Leavitt , Arizona State Last week: 19 23. Rocco Becht , Iowa State Last week: 21 24.

4886898a69c7,"Bengals vs. Steelers anytime touchdown scorer picks, betting odds, predictions: Target D.K. Metcalf on TNF","anytime touchdown scorer, anytime td scorer, touchdown picks, touchdown scorer, anytime touchdown scorer picks","Thursday Night Football in Week 7 will pit the Cincinnati Bengals against the Pittsburgh Steelers in a battle of 40-year-old quarterbacks as Joe Flacco and Aaron Rodgers lead their respective teams. Flacco was acquired via trade last week and started five days later for the Bengals, while Rodgers was signed late in the offseason and has guided the Steelers to a 4-1 start. How might these seasoned quarterbacks impact the scoring chances of Ja'Marr Chase, Tee Higgins, D.K. Metcalf and Jaylen Warren? Metcalf has scored in four consecutive games, but he's still listed as high as +145 in the anytime touchdown scorer odds for Bengals vs. Steelers. He's one of our top anytime TD scorer picks for Thursday Night Football. Targeting NFL player props is one way to approach NFL odds at online sports betting sites for Thursday Night Football in Week 7. With NFL props available for almost every player in Steelers vs. Bengals at top online sportsbooks , SportsLine's proven computer model can help you find value to add to your Bengals vs. Steelers NFL picks .

The model went 41-21 on top-rated picks dating back to 2024. Anybody following its NFL betting picks at sportsbooks and on betting sites could have seen strong returns. Now, it has revealed its top anytime touchdown picks for Steelers vs. Bengals. Best Week 7 Thursday Night Football anytime TD prop picks: D.K. Metcalf, Steelers (+145, FanDuel) Metcalf has only been targeted 31 times over the first five games of the season, but he's providing incredible value when the ball is going his way. He enters Week 7 with 19 catches for 357 yards and four touchdowns. He's scored in a variety of ways during his current four-game scoring streak, with touchdowns of 2, 12, 25 and 80 yards in that span. The model predicts that Metcalf averages 0.84 touchdowns, but the implied scoring probability is 40.8% . Ja'Marr Chase, Bengals (+145, DraftKings) Despite Burrow (toe) going down in the second game of the season and the Bengals struggling with Jake Browning under center, Chase is putting up solid numbers yet again with 42 catches for 468 yards and four touchdowns. In Flacco's first start, Chase was targeted 12 times and had 10 receptions for 94 yards and a touchdown. He's now scored three times over his last two games and has five touchdowns in six career games against Pittsburgh. The implied scoring probability here is 40.8%, but the model has Chase scoring 0.55 touchdowns on average . Jonnu Smith, Steelers (+360, FanDuel) Acquired as part of a blockbuster offseason trade that also included Jalen Ramsey and Minkah Fitzpatrick, Smith has 17 receptions in his first five games with the Steelers, but has only produced 89 yards. His average distance of target has only been 0.4 yards this season, but the fact that Arthur Smith is scheming him touches in such a fashion spells out his perceived value. He's scored once this season, but the Bengals have given up five touchdowns in the last four weeks to tight ends. The model predicts that Johnson scores 0.26 touchdowns on average, but these odds imply a 21.7% chance of scoring .

a68e637f78d6,"USWNT roster: Trinity Rodman, Jaedyn Shaw back in the squad and European club players return to the mix",,"The U.S. women's national team will be back in action after 113 days. The program will play a three-game series in October against Portugal and New Zealand, and head coach Emma Hayes has named a 26-player roster for the upcoming matches. Two of the three games will feature retirement celebrations for Alex Morgan and Alyssa Naeher as the group aims to build off their previous meeting, a 3-0 win over Canada, in July. ""We are extremely excited to get back together with the team,"" said Hayes. ""There has been a big gap from July until now and we've watched many club games. Now, it's time to start the build towards qualifying for the 2027 World Cup. We want to maximize every minute we have together, push the players, and keep the momentum going. These three fantastic games ahead of us will help us do that."" The three game window will begin against Portugal on Oct. 23 and Oct. 26 before concluding against New Zealand on Oct. 29. The expanded roster is to help manage player minutes and match load with the upcoming NWSL playoffs set to begin in November, and Hayes will only name 23 players on matchdays. Forward Trinity Rodman returns to the USWNT camps for the first time since April. The lengthy absence was due to a back injury, and she has since returned to play with her club, Washington Spirit. Rodman scored the game-winner in her last USWNT appearance, a 2-0 win against Brazil. Gotham FC midfielder Jaedyn Shaw also marks her return to the senior team after featuring with the U-23 team since April. While Hayes is narrowing down her pool of players ahead of FIFA Women's World Cup qualifiers in 2026, there are still players earning first-time callups. Second-year San Diego Wave defender Kennedy Wesley was named to the roster and could make her senior debut over the three friendlies after spending time with the U-23 program earlier this year. The October international window will have continued training camps running alongside the senior team. The U-23 program will be in Philadelphia, and the U-20 team will be in Kansas City, concurrent with the USWNT. The dual camps are an example of the U.S. Soccer's development philosophy, the U.S. Way , which focuses on and encourages increased opportunities for youth national teams. Also returning to the roster are several Americans who play abroad. Five players, midfielder Lindsey Heaps, defender Emily Fox, forward Catarina Macario, midfielder Lily Yohannes, and goalkeeper Phallon Tullis-Joyce, were given the summer window off. Alyssa Thompson joins the roster from Chelsea FC, her first call-up since moving to Europe. Each player is currently playing in the UEFA Champions League. Fans can watch every UWCL match across CBS Sports platforms , Paramount+ , CBS Sports Network , and CBS Sports Golazo Network . Take a look at the official roster: USWNT October roster Goalkeepers (3): Claudia Dickey (Seattle Reign FC; 2), Mandy McGlynn (Utah Royals; 4), Phallon Tullis-Joyce (Manchester United, ENG; 3) Defenders (8): Jordyn Bugg (Seattle Reign FC; 2/0), Emily Fox (Arsenal FC, ENG; 67/1), Lilly Reale (Gotham FC; 2/0), Tara McKeown (Washington Spirit; 8/0), Avery Patterson (Houston Dash; 6/1), Emily Sams (Orlando Pride; 5/0), Emily Sonnett (Gotham FC; 110/2), Kennedy Wesley (San Diego Wave; 0/0) Midfielders (8): Sam Coffey (Portland Thorns FC; 38/4), Lindsey Heaps (OL Lyonnes, FRA; 167/38), Claire Hutton (Kansas City Current; 6/1), Rose Lavelle (Gotham FC; 113/25), Sam Meza (Seattle Reign FC; 2/0), Olivia Moultrie (Portland Thorns FC; 9/2), Jaedyn Shaw (Gotham FC; 26/8), Lily Yohannes (OL Lyonnes, FRA; 8/1) Forwards (7): Michelle Cooper (Kansas City Current; 8/1), Catarina Macario (Chelsea FC, ENG; 24/11), Trinity Rodman (Washington Spirit; 47/11), Yazmeen Ryan (Houston Dash; 12/2), Emma Sears (Racing Louisville; 8/1), Ally Sentnor (Kansas City Current; 12/4), Alyssa Thompson (Chelsea FC, ENG; 22/3)",https://www.cbssports.com/soccer/news/uswnt-roster-trinity-rodman-jaedyn-shaw-back-in-the-squad-and-european-club-players-return-to-the-mix,Sport,cbssports.com,,https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2025/10/15/16542339-b8e3-441d-b293-0dee228eedcd/thumbnail/1200x675/14e86e607adb369b5e890eb82f3a2ea5/untitled-design-2025-10-15t173648-256.png,2025-10-15T16:01:14+00:00,fb769156bce6572889421513a5e4a610985d9c87
75f2b7cbb2ce,"Ranking the top 10 backcourts in college basketball: Alabama, Kentucky, Florida have top guards","college basketball player rankings, alabama basketball, kentucky basketball, florida basketball","Florida in 2025. UConn in both 2024 and 2023. Kansas in 2022. Baylor in 2021. Each men's college basketball champion the last five years — and for much of the last two decades, really — has one commonality: a heavy reliance on top-of-the-line backcourt talent. That is no coincidence. It is an instructive throughline of roster construction that should serve as a predictive point for future events. Using that intel, I dug into the rosters of some of the top teams in 2025-26 and ranked the top 10 backcourts in the sport. The results are below. College basketball rankings: Each AP Top 25 team's strengths, weaknesses and depth chart entering 2025-26 Isaac Trotter Obvious caveat: these rankings are not how I rank the teams, merely the backcourt of the roster. This is strictly a talent-based ranking that does not account for roster construction on the whole. And in the interest of transparency, it only partially accounts for the coaching and the way in which I expect their respective staffs to deploy them. Let's dive in. Backcourt prediction : PG Labaron Philon , SG Aden Holloway , SG/SF Latrell Wrightsell Jr . Last season, Alabama won 28 games and had the No. 4 offense in adjusted efficiency rating at KenPom.com while finishing first in adjusted tempo. That high-octane attack was led by then-freshman  Philon and then-sophomore Holloway. Now both Philon and Holloway are back in 2025-26. Mark Sears is gone from the equation, yes, but Philon and Holloway fit neatly in Nate Oats' system and understand how to facilitate one of college basketball's most innovative offenses — Philon being a blur-of-energy with his burst and Holloway, a 96th percentile jump shooter last season per Synergy data, operating as a combo killer alongside him. There will be and should be questions about how Philon and Holloway defend teams, but that concern will prove to be overblown hogwash when the Tide jam past teams with one of the most efficient offensive attacks in the sport. Backcourt prediction : PG Milos Uzan , SG Isiah Harwell , SG/SF Emanuel Sharp Even after losing LJ Cryer and Mylik Wilson , Houston is again flush with talent thanks to the return of backcourt stars Uzan and Sharp. Uzan, who started all 40 games for Houston last season and led the team in assists, has Big 12 Player of the Year potential. He ranked 11th nationally in assist/turnover ratio at 2.98 and is in line to inherit the keys to the kingdom. Sharp, meanwhile, a two-year starter for the Cougars, is Mr. Reliable as a sharpshooter. Word out of Houston is that he's had a great offseason. Both Uzan and Sharp were key pieces on a team that last season rated in the 99th percentile in transition offense. That will again be this team's bread and butter. Freshmen Kingston Flemings and Harwell, a probing playmaker and a lengthy guard/wing hybrid, should also be impact additions early here in H-Town. Backcourt prediction : PG Jaland Lowe , PG/SG Denzel Aberdeen , SG/SF Otega Oweh Second-year coach Mark Pope has a foundational backcourt led by returning senior Oweh and buttressed by Pitt transfer guard Lowe. Oweh was an All-SEC performer last season with the Wildcats and a top-60 NBA Draft prospect in my rankings before returning to school. He's the second-leading returning scorer in the SEC this season. Lowe, meanwhile, was quietly effective last season as a do-it-all combo guard with the Panthers, averaging 16.8 points and 5.5 assists. Together, alongside incoming guard Jasper Johnson and Florida transfer Aberdeen, this bunch can bring UK back to the mountaintop in the SEC. It's not my prediction — but it should surprise no one if it happens. Backcourt prediction : PG Braden Smith , SG Fletcher Loyer , SG/SF C.J. Cox Any team that has a talent the caliber of Smith gets an obvious boost. So Purdue comes in at a confident No. 4 for me. Smith will be a potential preseason Player of the Year frontrunner for a Purdue team that could open the season preseason No. 1. He's that good; few were as efficient on catch-and-shoot chances last season as him (94th percentile, per Synergy), and few were as crucial to their team's success overall because of his dynamism as a playmaker, scorer and charisma. His supporting cast is stellar in the backcourt, too, tied to long-time running mate Loyer. Loyer was a 99th percentile finisher on catch-and-shoot opportunities last season and was a 96th percentile finisher on jump shots. Purdue trusts him to take and make big shots and he often delivers. There's also rising sophomores Gicarri Harris and Cox, both of whom the Boilermakers have high hopes for this season, to keep a watchful eye on here in this backcourt. 5. Florida Gators Backcourt prediction : CG Boogie Fland , CG Xaivian Lee , SG AJ Brown A team that lost Walter Clayton Jr. and Will Richard and Alijah Martin from its backcourt is top 10 in this list? Yes. Not a typo. That's what a wagon Florida is right now on the recruiting trail. Coach Todd Golden and his staff snagged Arkansas transfer Fland and Princeton transfer Lee, among others, to rebuild their backcourt via the portal this offseason. That's where the thesis of this No. 5 ranking starts. Both Fland and Lee are not only sensational talents in their own right — both will play in the NBA — but they also fit the mold of what Florida does well: scoring the ball. Fland was a 97th percentile bucket-getter on catch-and-shoot opportunities in his one season with Arkansas, and Lee has some Clayton Jr. to his game with a 94th percentile placement on dribble jumpers — which Clayton excelled in last season. My prediction: Florida wins the SEC by multiple games because of the dream fit with Lee and Fland paired next to returners Thomas Haugh , Alex Condon and Rueben Chinyelu. This is a team that knows what it is and what it wants to be, and a staff that has hand-picked players to fit neatly into roles they can scheme to success. Backcourt prediction : PG Mikel Brown Jr. , SG Ryan Conwell , SG Isaac McKneely Many claim Louisville is the rightful throne-holder as Point Guard U. This season may prove those who make that claim to be both vindicated and prescient: because Brown is about to put on a show. The freshman guard is the biggest reason why the Cards claim top-10 status here, as he's been exceptional on the FIBA circuit and is worthy of being considered a top-two freshman in the sport next season from day one. My friend Adam Finkelstein's scouting report on him from last summer aged beautifully, and this part should stick with you: There isn't much he can't do with the ball in his hands. He has total control of his handle, as both a creator and distributor, and a terrific left hand. He's a talented passer with excellent floor vision and capable of hitting all corners of the court. He can throw pinpoint crosscourt skip passes with both hands, zip in pocket passes off the dribble, and make all the other associated pick-and-roll reads with good timing. He can rise-up for pull-ups off the dribble and posted 45/40/91 shooting splits in 3SSB action. There are still moments when he can be streaky as a shooter, as he continues to adjust to his evolving body mechanics, but he has a very clean release and projects as a real shot-maker long-term. Brown also has very good natural pace and appears to possess a real intellect for the game as well, picking up and implementing concepts quickly. We've also seen more consistent two-way engagement as of late, with a matured motor and overall approach. He'll be surrounded by vets who are highly capable to boot, with Xavier transfer Conwell, Virginia transfer McKneely and Kennesaw transfer Adrian Wooley positioned to reshape this group for the better. I'm buying all the Louisville stock I can get my hands on both in the short term and the long term. This program's trajectory is on a rocket ship to the moon. Backcourt prediction : PG Donovan Dent , CG Skyy Clark , SG Jamar Brown New Mexico transfer Dent won Player of the Year honors in the MWC last season and now headlines a retooled backcourt in Westwood for coach Mick Cronin. Dent has All-American level abilities after averaging 20.4 points. 6.4 assists and shooting 40.9% from 3-point range last season — all career highs — and he's positioned to pop right away alongside returning guard Clark. Dent goes from a team at New Mexico that was top 10 in adjusted tempo to a UCLA team that under Cronin is notorious for running a slower, methodical system. So I think the fit is a bit curious on paper, keeping UCLA from being in the top five. But Dent's talent and UCLA's proven system of success will win out in the end here to warrant this spot. Cronin will find a way to enmesh his new star nicely by incorporating ways to make sure his new pupil still shines in ways he's comfortable. That's what great coaches do. Backcourt prediction : PG Rob Wright III, SG Kennard Davis, SG Richie Saunders BYU grabbed two big-name players this offseason to remake its backcourt under second-year coach Kevin Young: Baylor transfer point guard Wright, and Southern Illinois transfer Davis. That should be a stellar way to reboot around five-star freshman forward AJ Dybantsa and returning sharpshooter Saunders. Wright III was ninth in assists per game last season among Big 12 players as a true freshman and fifth nationally among all freshmen. Saunders was 12th in 3-point percentage (43.2%) among players in college hoops who made at least 79 3-pointers on the season. And Davis was fourth among all scorers in the MVC last season at 16.3 points per game. This team finished ninth in adjusted efficiency on offense last season and yet despite losing Egor Demin and several others, it feels like they still improved their weapons on that end of the floor. Backcourt prediction : PG Ian Jackson , SG Joson Sanon , SG Oziyah Sellers A lineup of Jackson (UNC transfer), Sanon (ASU transfer) and Sellers ( Stanford transfer) should — should! — give St. John's a capable-enough offense to upgrade from last year's oft-struggling unit. That's what coach Rick Pitino believes, anyway . Jackson averaged 11.9 points and shot 39.5% on 3-pointers last season. Sanon also averaged 11.9 points and he shot 36.9% on 3-pointers. Sellers shot the best of that bunch at 40.1% on 3-pointers while tallying a career-best 13.7 points per game. This backcourt is almost certainly going to struggle more on the defensive side than last season's because of how impactful Kadary Richmond was, but this team on the whole still projects to be very good defensively. What this unit can bring on offense will offset any deficiencies. I like how the pieces fit around each other and, most importantly, I believe in how Pitino will deploy them. 10. UConn Huskies Backcourt prediction : PG Malachi Smith , SG Braylon Mullins , CG Silas Demary Jr . This ranking is another indicator of the belief I have in the coach and the system the program runs. Dan Hurley will get the most out of this bunch and the talent is upgraded from last season to boot. Demary ( Georgia transfer) and Mullins (five-star freshman) are stars in their roles on defense and on offense, respectively, and Smith ( Dayton transfer) is a needed presence at point guard who can upgrade their playmaking. Smith was second among all Atlantic 10 players in assists per game (5.3) last season and 44th nationally in assist/turnover ratio. Those fresh new faces will pair well with returning guard Solo Ball , who for my money can make a run at Big East Player of the Year this season. Ball bounced from 3.3 points in 2023-24 to 14.4 per game last season and shot a scorching 41.4% on 3-pointers. He can play both on and off the ball, but his 84th percentile finish last season on catch-and-shoots suggests he could flourish off it, especially paired with an elite ball-mover at point in Smith and other capable playmakers including Demary. Honorable mentions To leave off teams that will feature Jackson Shelstad ( Oregon ), Bennett Stirtz ( Iowa ), John Blackwell ( Wisconsin ) and Bruce Thornton ( Ohio State ) from this article would feel like an oversight. They just missed the top 10. (Full disclosure: Iowa State and Mississippi State were next up. I love Tamin Lipsey (ISU) and ditto for Josh Hubbard (MSU). I'm just less optimistic about their supporting cast than others who made this list.)",https://www.cbssports.com/college-basketball/news/ranking-the-top-10-backcourts-in-college-basketball-alabama-kentucky-florida-have-top-guards,Sport,cbssports.com,,https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2025/10/15/98cc7014-5981-4e18-964f-d135560474e3/thumbnail/1200x675/30d7693a7444f78a9cc723b9bf02c331/gettyimages-2206589981-1.jpg,2025-10-15T15:51:49+00:00,900c3d14c3035e2d3bdc646e746cf96a869ad7b1
78da87d9d093,"Missouri's Eli Drinkwitz dismisses coaching carousel rumors, takes aim at social media speculation","eli drinkwitz, college football coaching carousel, college football coaching rumors, penn state nittany lions, missouri tigers","Missouri coach Eli Drinkwitz had plenty to say about his name surfacing in the college football coaching carousel -- and he didn't hold back. The Tigers sixth-year coach has been mentioned in recent days as a potential candidate for the Penn State job following James Franklin's ouster. But Drinkwitz dismissed the speculation with a mix of frustration and humor, using the moment to take aim at the rampant coaching rumors and the constant chatter on social media. ""I think the No. 1 issue right now amongst college football is the noise that's associated with people's programs at all points of the season, whether good, bad or indifferent,"" Drinkwitz said when asked about compartmentalizing outside distractions. ""There's no such thing as journalistic integrity on social media. There's just wild, outlandish reporting and anybody's name -- I'll bet every sitting head coach has been listed as a candidate for some job so far."" Drinkwitz then denounced a report stating Missouri offensive coordinator Kirby Moore had interviewed for the Arkansas coaching job, calling the now-deleted social media post a ""complete lie."" ""(Moore) never interviewed. Didn't even talk to anybody at Arkansas,"" Drinkwitz said. ""It was a bunch of bull crap put out there to try to create distractions and a narrative that then comes over after the fact after the game. It's really disappointing that this stuff happens. Because again, Twitter ain't real and it's just a bunch of bull crap thrown on message boards."" Whether deserved or not, it's the way of the industry. The moment a coach is fired, names immediately start circulating as potential replacements. Some of those early mentions eventually materialize into legitimate candidates, while others never go beyond speculation. This year alone, there have already been eight coaching vacancies in the FBS, and programs are making changes earlier than ever to get ahead of the line for top candidates. For Drinkwitz, the attention is a byproduct of Missouri's recent success. Although it took a few years to build the program into an SEC contender, the Tigers are 26-6 in the past three seasons under Drinkwitz. They've opened the 2025 campaign 5-1 and are on pace for a third-consecutive double-digit win season for the first time in program history. But even amid the speculation, his focus remains on Missouri. ""So how do I block it out? I ignore it, and I get mad about it when people ask me about it -- no,"" Drinkwitz said jokingly. ""As far as my name [being] associated with everything, that's awesome for the University of Missouri. It means we're doing something really good. Means that our administration is committed to excellence. It means all the investment that the people here have made has resulted in our success."" While there's still a chance Drinkwitz could be a candidate elsewhere at some point during this coaching carousel, he has no interest in entertaining the speculation during the season.",https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/news/missouris-eli-drinkwitz-coaching-carousel-rumors,Sport,cbssports.com,,https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2025/10/15/bd49cb6f-320a-4d01-be61-cac1273ff887/thumbnail/1200x675/c8fd465f8a51ce023c44c3661e69ca52/eli-drinkwitz-missouri.jpg,2025-10-15T15:49:00+00:00,1f88f7c861e762ead2ad4ec4a28176c11a15b24a

450a4dde8aee,Rory McIlroy says 2025 Ryder Cup win for Europe is being remembered for 'the wrong reasons',,"Rory McIlroy would like to see the 2025 Ryder Cup remembered more for what happened on the course as opposed to what happened off of it. While Europe made history by winning an away Ryder Cup for only the seventh time in the event's history, much of the focus has instead been on the verbal abuse McIlroy and other Europeans received from some of fans. ""I've been following the narrative coming out of the Ryder Cup, just like everyone else,"" he said this week . ""Unfortunately, I think it takes away from what we should be focused on, which is what an incredible performance it was by the European Team."" McIlroy said that he didn't realize in the moment just how good Europe's performance was, especially during the first two days of the Ryder Cup when they built a commanding seven-point lead entering the final day of competition. He said that watching the highlights over the past two weeks has given him a newfound appreciation for what he and his teammates were able to accomplish. ""The Americans would hit it close, we would hit it closer,"" he said. ""The Americans would hole a putt, we'd hole a putt on top on them. And it just happened every single time."" The Power 18 golf rankings: Xander Schauffele returns to top five, Cameron Young among most notable movers Patrick McDonald On the precipice of a blowout, Europe had to withstand a furious comeback attempt by the United States on the final day of competition. As good as Europe had been during the first two days, that's how good the United States was on Sunday during singles matches. In fact, it appeared that the U.S. was on the verge of an historic comeback before Shane Lowry made two incredible shots on 18 that included a birdie putt that gave the Europe the win. Europe's dominance during the first two days and the U.S. comeback attempt on Sunday are just two of the main storylines from a Ryder Cup that won't soon be forgotten. There was also the dynamic between the two captains Luke Donald and Keegan Bradley, the controversial ""envelope rule"" and the largely forgotten singles match between McIlroy and Scottie Scheffler that was the first in Ryder Cup history between the world's No. 1 and No. 2 ranked players. There was also the unruly behavior by some of the fans that led to PGA of America president Dan Rea Jr. issuing a public apology shortly after the Ryder Cup's conclusion. McIlroy and others have also chimed in on the less than ideal experience. Simply put, you can't talk about the 2025 Ryder Cup without talking about the hostile environment that -- for better and unfortunately for worse -- added to the drama that took place during those three days at Bethpage Black in New York. McIlroy certainly understands that, but he'd obviously prefer that storyline to take a backseat to some of the other things that happened during what was a memorable three days of golf. ""I think the unfortunate thing is, it seems like people aren't remembering that and they're remembering the week for the wrong reasons,"" he said. ""I'd like to shift the narrative a little bit and just focus on how good the European Team was and how proud I was to be part of that team to win an away Ryder Cup.""",https://www.cbssports.com/golf/news/rory-mcilroy-says-2025-ryder-cup-win-for-europe-is-being-remembered-for-the-wrong-reasons,Sport,cbssports.com,,https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2025/10/15/bc7e04dd-28e2-4ebc-89cf-ea3d768abb77/thumbnail/1200x675/acc383e6a8b6dd250f3d215875e9e46e/mcilroy.jpg,2025-10-15T15:39:41+00:00,a7e9d27c0f771e224f5ed6d1714039d7dc26b6bb

That's not a surprise given Burrow is one of the league's elite QBs, but when you've invested in star receivers like Ja'Marr Chase and Tee Higgins , the inability to get them the football stands out. After a few poor starts with Jake Browning , the Bengals made a rare intra-division trade with the Browns to bring in veteran Joe Flacco , and the offense showed some mild improvement in his first start since making the move to southern Ohio. The best thing he did was get the ball to Chase, who had 10 catches for 94 yards and a touchdown against the Packers , but some have wondered if it'd be possible for Chase to be even more involved. On Wednesday, Chase was asked if he thought he knew the offense well enough to step in and play quarterback himself if needed. ""I mean, I know it. I can — I don't want to play quarterback . Let me just say that,"" Chase said. ""I don't want to play quarterback, but I can tell guys like, you here, here, here and here. Yeah, I can do that, but I do not wanna play quarterback."" This is a savvy, veteran answer from Chase. He gets out in front of it by making it abundantly clear he has no interest in playing quarterback, while noting that he knows the offense well enough to get guys into the right positions. It's never a great sign when, even in fun, the star receiver is getting asked if he thinks he could play quarterback if needed. For now, the Bengals star will be happy to catch passes from a solid veteran in Flacco. He will hope that Burrow, whom he starred alongside going back to their LSU days, will be able to return this season, and I'm sure his appreciation for his longtime QB has only increased during this absence.",https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/jamarr-chase-i-dont-wanna-play-qb-bengals-offense,Sport,cbssports.com,,https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2025/10/15/897178fc-f2b2-4f78-a384-7d23828100b4/thumbnail/1200x675/1eaca2fef1f659c9d625da83878bc199/jamarr.jpg,2025-10-15T15:26:00+00:00,a053483333129407011025aaadde3ceca40b2338

While FedEx Cup Fall continues to take shape and the DP World Tour inches towards its postseason, which culminates in the Middle East, most of the best golfers in the world are working on their games eyeing the start of 2026. World No. 1 Scottie Scheffler is among those who have hung up the cleats the Hero World Challenge comes around in December. The four-time major champion won his 19th PGA Tour title at the Procore Championship in the build up to the Ryder Cup but fell flat against Europe garnering a 1-4-0 record thanks to a singles victory over Rory McIlroy. McIlroy, meanwhile, enjoyed an extremely productive Ryder Cup with a 3-1-1 personal record. Dealing with adversity inside and outside the ropes, the Northern Irishman successfully called his shot and raised the cup amid the hostility that were thrown at him at Bethpage Black. The Northern Irishman could not have gotten the job done without his fellow Europeans, namely Tommy Fleetwood and Jon Rahm. Those two were exquisite during the first four sessions before they, too, fell in Sunday singles amid the Americans' desperate attempt at clawing back into the competition. Matt Fitzpatrick made everyone forget about his poor Ryder Cup record with his play on Long Island, while New York's own Cameron Young showed that when the lights are the brightest, he has the guts and gumption to perform on the grandest of stages. The Power 18 provides insight as to how golfers are currently performing with benefit given to their play over recent events. It is a wider lens than simply what happened at the last tournament to be played but more narrow than the Official World Golf Rankings, which take into account how more than 2,000 golfers perform across an entire season.

a8731158c1ec,Ty Simpson went from backup to breakout -- now the Alabama QB is climbing 2026 NFL Draft boards,"ty simpson 2026 nfl draft, ty simpson nfl draft, ty simpson draft stock, ty simpson scouting report, ty simpson quarterback, ty simpson nfl draft projection, ty simpson nfl draft profile, alabama qb ty simpson highlights","As if this year's quarterback class wasn't enough of a jumbled mess , another first-year starter has been making waves in the scouting community through the first six weeks of the season. So much so that the Shrine Bowl scouting staff already has Alabama's Ty Simpson with a comparable grade to more established starters like Garrett Nussmeier and Fernando Mendoza (although Shrine Bowl grades are used more for bucketing players into potential roles and are less granular than NFL team grades). From a numbers standpoint, it's not hard to see why. His 9.4 yards per attempt ranks 10th in the country, while his 13 touchdown passes rank eighth. Those numbers also came against the third-hardest schedule in college football , according to ESPN -- even with Simpson and the rest of the Crimson Tide laying an egg against Florida State in Week 1. Since that game, I'd argue no quarterback has played better the past five weeks than Simpson. Unlike other breakout stars such as Oregon's Dante Moore or Oklahoma's John Mateer , Simpson's film takes a little longer to see why he's getting scouts' attention. That's because between his arm, mobility and frame -- there isn't a single trait I'd describe as ""above-average"" by NFL standards. I don't want you to think he's poor in any of those categories, but college football is littered with quarterbacks who can match Simpson's physical profile. It's not until you see him layer the football over second-level defenders, lead receivers away from coverage consistently and attack zones with anticipation -- that's when you start to understand that Simpson has the goods. It was the Wisconsin tape in Week 3 where he first caught my eye. In that game, he went 24-for-29 passing for 382 yards, four touchdowns and no interceptions. Of the five times the ball hit the ground, two were because of drops. From a mechanical, timing and decision-making perspective, it was how an NFL-ready quarterback is supposed to look. That's special for the third start of someone's career. If I had to point to the one thing I've consistently seen on tape that makes Simpson so good, it's knowing how to attack space in defenses. At quarterback, you're not always throwing routes as they're drawn up on paper. Sometimes you have to stop a receiver with your ball placement or lead them elsewhere to avoid defenders. You saw that on numerous occasions last week against Vanderbilt . College Football QB Power Rankings: Alabama's Ty Simpson takes No. 1, Nico Iamaleava returns to top 50 David Cobb Simpson is an intriguing prospect for a lot of reasons, but one thing working against him is his age. He's older than you'd like for a prospect getting their first opportunity, as he'll turn 23 years old in December. With on-field experience being at a premium for evaluators, he'll face an interesting decision. Come back to school and turn 25 as a rookie, or make the leap with one season as a starter under his belt. While the answer to that question will become clearer as the season wears on, it's important to remember why experience matters. It's because mastery matters when put in an unfamiliar situation. Mastering the minutiae of the quarterback position -- footwork, mechanics, protections, eye discipline and more -- before you get to the league is a must. There's so much else that's heaped onto your plate in the league as a young quarterback that if you're thinking about your ball-handling, you won't process the rest of the game at the speed you need to. With Simpson, I'm not too worried about the minutiae given what he's already put on tape. Yes, there's no replicating reps when it comes to consistently reading coverages and blitzes, but Simpson has clearly put in the work when it comes to what he could control as a backup for three years. On top of simply continuing the level of play we've seen from Simpson through the rigors of an SEC schedule, the one thing I want to see more of from the Alabama signal-caller is aggressiveness downfield. He certainly has the receivers to attack deep and is accurate on such throws, but to date, he ranks 83rd in deep attempts in all of college football, with 17 (10 completions). In Michael Penix Jr.'s final season with Kalen DeBoer at Washington in 2023, he ranked first with 117. Penix's average depth of target was 10.7 compared to Simpson's 8.1. Add in some aggressiveness to Simpson's already efficient play, and the NFL will come calling early. 2026 NFL Draft No. 1 pick odds Bet college football with Fanduel Sportsbook , where new users get $300 in bonus bets with a winning $5 wager.

Ty Simpson NFL comparison: Sam Darnold Neither Darnold nor Simpson pop off the tape with their athleticism or arm talent, but that doesn't mean they can't make high-end NFL throws. There's a creative element to both of their games that's their calling card, as they can throw receivers open and do just enough on the move to scare you.

a0f7cbca3e72,"Dana White beginning to put together debut event on Paramount, says Ilia Topuria is a 'possibility'",,"UFC CEO Dana White has promised to kick off the promotion's new deal with Paramount in a big way. White now says the debut card in the new deal, which begins in January, could be anchored by lightweight champion Ilia Topuria. Speaking with reporters after Tuesday's episode of Dana White's Contender Series, White said the matchmaking process for the Paramount debut began ""literally today."" ""Matchmaking was today, and we started working on the first Paramount card today,"" White continued. Many of the biggest potential stars the UFC could book, such as Jon Jones and Conor McGregor, have focused their pitches for their next fight on the planned UFC card at the White House in June. Not that a fighter couldn't fight on both the Paramount debut and again nearly half a year later at the White House, but Jones and McGregor are unique stars whose schedules have not operated in the same way as ""normal"" fighters for many years. Not to mention that McGregor has not fought since 2021 and is serving a suspension for violating the UFC's anti-doping policy that does not end until March, taking him completely off the table. UFC lightweight division in 2025: Where things stand with Ilia Topuria, Paddy Pimblett and more at 155 pounds Brian Campbell Topuria (17-0) is one star who is available and not currently scheduled for a fight. Topuria has stormed through his opponents, winning the featherweight championship with a knockout of Alexander Volkanovski in February 2024 and defending the belt the following October by knocking out Max Holloway. Seeking further glory, Topuria vacated his title to jump to lightweight, where he scored his third consecutive knockout in a title fight, beating Charles Oliveira to capture the vacant championship at 155 pounds. When asked about the idea of Topuria headlining the Paramount debut, White said, ""It's a possibility."" White also spoke about the end of the promotion's deal with ESPN, promising to continue delivering the best product he can as the deal winds through its final months. ""We're always going to try to put on the best cards that we can,"" White said. ""We've had a great relationship with ESPN, and we were talking earlier, everybody is already starting to feel it. There's a lot of relationships between the ESPN team that comes to all the fights and works and the UFC team, and everybody is starting to feel it coming to the end here. They've been great to us, and they've been great to the sport. We want to put on a badass last card for them.""",https://www.cbssports.com/mma/news/dana-white-beginning-to-put-together-debut-event-on-paramount-says-ilia-topuria-is-a-possibility,Sport,cbssports.com,,https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2025/10/15/c426ddf6-35e7-4644-99ab-cdbbf39b59e1/thumbnail/1200x675/61255443f9e03f1309b29fcb8f0e83ee/ilia-topuria-getty.jpg,2025-10-15T15:17:08+00:00,5156c8df133c7801a9ea3be27d7572d1b7de5c18

Already we've seen the Cincinnati Bengals turn to Joe Flacco in an effort to stabilize their quarterback room, and that's just the start of what figures to be a busy few weeks. Expect fringe contenders like the Steelers and Buccaneers to explore upgrades, while teams stuck near the bottom, such as the Jets and Saints, weigh offers for veterans who could bring back draft capital. To help you track all the NFL trade deals ahead of the deadline, we'll be logging every move in one place with concise analysis highlighting who got better, who got future assets, and what it means for the season ahead. Whether it's a blockbuster involving a former Pro Bowler or a depth move that fills a key injury gap, this page will be your running guide through deadline season. Jags get: Greg Newsome, sixth-round pick Lanky corner in final year of rookie deal This is a win-now move. Jacksonville gets a solid cornerback in Newsome, who has graded out well this year, allowing just a 52% completion rate as the primary defender, on track to be the best of his career. Through five Weeks, he's Pro Football Focus' 33rd-ranked cornerback out of 85 who have played at least 150 defensive snaps; Campbell is 57th. Newsome is in the fifth and final year of his rookie deal, so he's set to be a free agent at the end of this season. There's a significant scheme adjustment here, too, as the Browns play the highest rate of man coverage in the league by far, while Jacksonville is 23rd, but clearly the Jaguars see plenty to like in Newsome. Jacksonville does take on a $19.5-million dead cap hit in 2026, but that's a problem for a few months from now. Browns get: Tyson Campbell , seventh-round pick Solid starter getting a fresh start This is a depth improvement for Cleveland. Campbell had a strong 2024 season after signing a four-year, $76.5 million extension, but the new Jaguars regime clearly wanted to move on from him after a slow start to this season. A significant chunk of that deal has already been paid, meaning the Browns will get to look at Campbell for nearly an entire season and evaluate how he fits both now and in the future. Campbell has had some injury issues, but when he's healthy, he's a starting-caliber cornerback, and one who's under team control well into the future. Harbaughs do defensive business (10/7) Athletic but inconsistent edge rusher This is a win-now move for Los Angeles. Oweh broke out last season with 10 sacks in 2024  -- double his previous career high – but the 2021 first-round pick is yet to record a sack this season. His pressure rate this season – 10.3% – is slightly lower than his 11.7% last year, but neither are particularly impressive numbers; he was at 17.2% in 2023. Perhaps time had simply run its course for Oweh in Baltimore. He was playing on the fifth-year option  of his rookie deal and will be a free agent this offseason. In Los Angeles, he'll play under innovative defensive coordinator Jesse Minter and hope to provide pressure both before and after Khalil Mack returns from an elbow injury. Through five weeks, Los Angeles ranks 19th in pressure rate. Reliable safety, plus a better draft pick I see this as a dart throw. Things have already gone majorly off the rails for Baltimore (1-4), and trading away a former first-round pick certainly wasn't on the Bingo card one month ago. But Baltimore has better depth and youth on the edge than it does at safety, where ArDarius Washington tore his Achilles during the offseason and Kyle Hamilton has been dealing with a groin injury. That left undrafted rookie Reuben Lowery to play every defensive snap of a 44-10 Week 5 loss to the Texans . Flacco gets new job, stays in Ohio (10/7) Bengals get: Joe Flacco, sixth-round pick Aging pocket passer hoping to raise the floor Sometimes, the NFL is about optics, and the Bengals trailing 28-3 at halftime and Jake Browning getting booed off the field after his third interception in an eventual 37-24 loss to the Lions in Week 4 was bad, bad optics. Enter Flacco, whom Cleveland benched after Week 4. Through five weeks, Browning was dead last in expected points added per dropback. Flacco was third-worst. The Bengals are hoping Flacco can provide a similar boost to the one he provided Cleveland in 2023, when it ended up making the playoffs thanks to a late-season surge. The Bengals don't have near the defense the Browns do, and the offensive line is a mess, but for a cheap price, it's a move that makes sense. If Flacco recaptures the magic, great. If he doesn't, this season was probably lost the moment Joe Burrow got hurt anyway. It's a total dart throw. Browns get: Fifth-round pick A modest gain in draft position Flacco was no longer part of the plan in Cleveland, which moves up a round in the draft. That's solid business for a team that's had its eye on the future essentially since this season began.",https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/nfl-2025-trade-deadline-tracker,Sport,cbssports.com,,https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2025/10/13/fdcb85ba-f8c7-4a14-a743-a5752f93b0f1/thumbnail/1200x675/940650d6248a56e55ab5b1c275f57ec5/flaccoexcited.jpg,2025-10-15T14:40:00+00:00,06a2227ffdcdaa339d8ce10fa072ddb638c32765

We're up to five openings in the power conferences midway through the 2025 season --  and that doesn't count Stanford, where Frank Reich was named interim coach in March. Only five power jobs came open all of last season, when 30 total jobs (25 in the Group of 6) were filled.  Overall, the two years leading up to this cycle (2025-26) were the most hectic we've seen this century, with a total of 61 programs changing head coaches. That means an incredible 44.9% of FBS teams changed leadership during a two-year span. That number will skyrocket this fall and winter.  CBS Sports is tracking every move in the 2025-26 cycle and grading each hire below.       College football coaching carousel    TeamInOutAnalysisKenni BurnsKent State fired Kenni Burns in April for violations of his contract that included use of his personal card for expenses. Burns was a dismal 1-23 in two seasons leading the Flashes, including a 0-12 record in 2024.Troy TaylorStanford fired Taylor amid allegations of mistreating female staffers. Taylor posted a 6-18 record in two seasons with the program after coming to Palo Alto after a successful run at Sacramento State. He lost eight of last nine games. The Cardinal hired Frank Reich to serve as interim coach, which reunites him and Stanford general manager Andrew Luck; Reich coached Luck with the Indianapolis Colts for one season in 2018.DeShaun FosterUCLA Foster only three games into his second season. The former All-American running back with the Bruins fished his tenure with a 5-10 record, including 3-6 in Big Ten matchups.Brent PryPry's tenure at     Virginia Tech     came to an end following his team's 0-3 start. The decision came after the Hokies' 45-26 home loss to     Old Dominion    , which was the third straight by double digits. The Hokies were never ranked in the three-plus years of Pry's tenure as coach. Pry's predecessor, Justin Fuente, went 43-31 at Virginia Tech, but was fired after going 10-11 in his final two seasons at the helm.Mike GundyOklahoma State     outsted Gundy after he spent more than two decades at the helm of the Cowboys. The move ended a tenure that once positioned the program among the Big 12's elite. Gundy, 58, was the second-longest tenured FBS coach. He departed after a steep decline during the past two seasons, including a 3-9 record in 2024 and a 1-2 start to 2025.Trent BrayOregon State &#xA0; fired Bray seven games into his winless second season leading the program. The Beavers dropped to 0-7 with Week 7's 39-14 loss to Wake Forest  , which marked their fourth double-digit defeat of the year. Bray's first year in his new post got off to a decent start. The Beavers went 4-1 through the first half of the 2024 regular season, with their only loss coming against Oregon, the eventual Big Ten champion. But Oregon State spiraled to 1-6 down the stretch, causing it to miss a bowl game.Sam PittmanArkansas  ' decision came following a 56-13 loss to Notre Dame and a week after the Razorbacks squandered an 18-point lead on the road at    Memphis &#xA0;Situated on one of college football's hottest seats  entering his sixth season at the program, Pittman finishes 32-34 overall at Arkansas, including a 14-29 mark against SEC competition. Since finishing 9-4 overall and finding a spot inside the final AP Top 25 poll to conclude the 2021 season, the Razorbacks sputtered under Pittman's guidance despite a bevy of coaching staff changes and roster alterations annually in recruiting and through the transfer portal.  James FranklinPenn State fired Franklin six games into his 12th season with the Nittany Lions -- amid a disastrous three-game slide. The No. 2 team in the preseason AP Top 25 just two months ago, the Nittany Lions slipped to 0-3 in Big Ten play following a stunning 22-21 home loss to Northwestern in Week 7 -- a game in which they were a three-touchdown favorite.

aeea5e1c4b8f,NHL Power Rankings: Same old story unfolding for Sabres as they try to snap a 14-year playoff drought,,"1 Stars After lighting the lamp 33 times last season, Wyatt Johnston has scored in each of the Stars' first three games. His latest one was an absolute beauty against the Wild on Tuesday night. 5 3-0-0 2 Avalanche The duo of Martin Necas and Nathan MacKinnon are off to quick starts with eight points each. If those two build off the chemistry they showed in a partial season together last year, they're going to be a major problem. -- 3-0-1 3 Oilers Connor McDavid has been held goal-less in Edmonton's first three games. The rest of the league should probably enjoy the calm before the storm because that won't last much longer. 2 2-0-1 4 Panthers In the absence of Aleksander Barkov, Anton Lundell has stepped up in this very young season. Lundell has four points in four games, and that's a good sign for the Panthers as they try to navigate this season without their captain. -- 3-1-0 5 Hurricanes K'Andre Miller had quite the debut with the Hurricanes. He scored two goals in the season-opener, and if Carolina can unlock Miller's full potential on the blue line, this team is an even bigger threat to win the Cup than we already thought. 2 3-0-0 6 Devils The Devils shelled out a seven-year, $63 million contract to Luke Hughes before the season, and the early returns are encouraging. Hughes is already up to four points, and he looks poised to take a step forward in 2025-26. 2 2-1-0 7 Golden Knights Decent start for Pavel Dorofeyev, if you can appreciate five goals in the team's first four games, including a hat trick in the season-opener. His career high of 35 goals -- set last season -- already looks to be in jeopardy. 4 2-0-2 8 Jets Some people (yours truly) wondered whether Mark Scheifele and Kyle Connor could repeat their incredible 2024-25 seasons. Well, they've combined for 11 points already. There may not be egg on my face yet, but it has been removed from the carton. 3 2-1-0 9 Maple Leafs The Maple Leafs have yet to score a power play goal, and I would be shocked to see these early struggles continue with Auston Matthews and William Nylander on that unit. Once the man advantage gets clicking, the Leafs should start to roll. -- 2-2-0 10 Senators After entering the season with high hopes, the Senators have already been dealt some poor luck. Brady Tkachuk will miss ""significant time"" with a hand injury he suffered in the team's third game of the season. -- 1-2-0 11 Capitals Logan Thompson and Charlie Lindgren have combined for a .938 save percentage and 5.07 goals saved above average to start the season. That kind of goaltending will do the trick for any team. 5 3-1-0 12 Lightning On the other end of the goaltending spectrum, we have Andrei Vasilevskiy, who has been uncharacteristically leaky in his first three starts. This is almost certainly a fluke based on a small sample size, but it's worth monitoring over the next few weeks. 7 1-2-1 13 Canadiens The offseason acquisition of Zack Bolduc already looks like a big winner for GM Kent Hughes. The 24-year-old winger already has three goals -- and has been quite noticeable in each game -- after a semi-breakout with the St. Louis Blues last season. 4 3-1-0 14 Kings Goaltending was a question mark for the Kings coming into the season, and it has let them down so far with 3.96 goals allowed above average. That may be an area where Los Angeles has to look for some help on the trade market. 2 1-2-1 15 Blues The Jimmy Snuggerud Calder Trophy campaign has already begun. The former Minnesota Golden Gopher has three points through three games, and I have to imagine his ice-time will only increase as he earns the trust of coach Jim Montgomery. 3 2-1-0 16 Wild The good news? The Wild have the best power play in the league through one week (47.6%). The bad news? The Wild have just four goals at five-on-five, which is one of the worst marks in the league. 2 2-2-0 17 Rangers The Rangers are still looking for their first goal at home. That's not a typo. They've been shutout in three straight games at Madison Square Garden. On Tuesday night, New York did generate 15 high-danger chances, so the dam will break before long. 2 2-3-0 18 Mammoth It's been a slow start for my preseason darlings, and that's certainly the case for Clayton Keller. The skilled winger has just four shots through three games when he averaged 2.65 per game last season. Keller needs to start pulling the trigger more frequently. 5 1-2-0 19 Red Wings The John Gibson era in Detroit got off to a miserable start when he allowed eight goals on 13 shots in the season-opener. Cam Talbot has gotten the last two starts -- and played well -- but we'll see whether Gibson can shake off his disastrous debut next time out. 2 2-1-0 20 Bruins If the Bruins are going to sniff the playoffs, they'll need David Pastrnak and Jeremy Swayman at the very top of their respective games. They've gotten that so far. Can they get it for 82 games? I guess we'll find out! 4 3-1-0 21 Kraken It took Matty Beniers eight games to find the back of the net last season, which wound up being a rather large disappointment. He needed just two to get his first goal of the 2025-26 campaign, so hopefully that's a sign of better things to come. 8 2-0-1 22 Canucks I'm not going to overreact to three games, but maybe I will. Elias Pettersson has one assist and three shots on goal. Given the way last season went for him, he's under a microscope, and this start won't take any of that pressure off Pettersson. 3 1-2-0 23 Penguins Justin Brazeau, a player with a career high of 10 goals, has four in four games. I love early-season NHL outliers. Then again, maybe Brazeau has just evolved into an 80-goal scorer. Watch out, Ovechkin. 7 2-2-0 24 Ducks Cutter Gauthier is a key member of the Ducks' young core, and he's up to three goals already. He seems to be enjoying life under new coach Joel Quenneville. 1 2-1-0 25 Predators In order for the Predators to rebound from the most disappointing season in franchise history, Juuse Saros needs to play up to his potential in goal. He's done that so far with a .947 save percentage and 4.35 goals saved above average. -- 2-1-1 26 Blue Jackets It's not been a perfect start for Columbus, but I will take any chance I get to highlight Kirill Marchenko. He has four goals, including a hat trick against the Wild on Saturday, and he's become one of the most fun power forwards in the NHL. 4 1-2-0 27 Flyers Matvei Michkov, one of the Calder Trophy candidates last season, has yet to get on the scoresheet in any capacity. There are also some questions about his conditioning. Not what the Flyers were hoping for from their new franchise player. -- 1-1-1 28 Sabres This may be a world record for the quickest vibes crash ever. The Sabres had hopes of ending their 14-year playoff drought, which have been tempered by an 0-3-0 start in which they've scored two combined goals. Still 79 games left! Keep the faith! 8 0-3-0 29 Flames Last season, Dustin Wolf was the Calder Trophy runner-up, and he nearly backstopped the Flames to a shocking playoff appearance. He's off to a poor start now, and Calgary has one win in its first four games. 1 1-3-0 30 Blackhawks Frank Nazar and Spencer Knight are off to good starts. That's some good news for the Hawks! 2 1-2-1 31 Sharks Macklin Celebrini, the 2025 Calder Trophy winner, is still very good at hockey. The majority of the team around him is still very bad at hockey. -- 0-1-2 32 Islanders Speaking of which, it might be a long year for the Islanders, but No. 1 overall pick Matthew Schaefer has three points in three games and looks absolutely electric with the puck on his stick. 6 0-3-0",https://www.cbssports.com/nhl/news/nhl-power-rankings-same-old-story-unfolding-for-sabres-as-they-try-to-snap-a-14-year-playoff-drought,Sport,cbssports.com,,https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2025/10/15/cd3586a1-0019-46b1-99df-c7a6b2fd7c4b/thumbnail/1200x675/17607efc5537489b83beca64dcb84da1/buffalo-sabres-nhl-pr-oct-25.jpg,2025-10-15T14:34:02+00:00,6c7b92a84ec08cc5903fa436fab25bf0559ebf88
57b5d0cfe6cf,USMNT show off depth in win over Australia despite Christian Pulisic injury; Women's Champions League returns,,"Welcome to Wednesday one and all. The international break is done and dusted and club football is right around the corner, both men's and women's. First up, it's the UEFA Women's Champions League on Wednesday and Thursday before the men's European club game starts up again. Before that, though, let's chat some USMNT. I'm James Benge. Let's go. 📺 Footy fix All times U.S./Eastern Wednesday, Oct. 15 🇪🇺 Champions League: Lyon vs. St Polten, 12:45 p.m. ➡️ Paramount+ , CBS Sports Golazo Network 🇪🇺 Champions League: Roma vs. Barcelona , 3 p.m. ➡️ Paramount+ 🏆 CONCACAF Champions Cup: Washington Spirit vs. Monterrey , 6:15 p.m. ➡️ Paramount+ , CBS Sports Golazo Network 🏆 CONCACAF Champions Cup: Orlando Pride vs. Pachuca , 8:45 p.m. ➡️ Paramount+ , CBS Sports Golazo Network Thursday, Oct. 16 🇪🇺 Champions League: Atletico Madrid vs. Manchester United , 12:45 p.m. ➡️ Paramount+ , CBS Sports Golazo Network 🇪🇺 Champions League: Bayern Munich vs. Juventus, 3 p.m. ➡️ Paramount+ , CBS Sports Golazo Network 🏆 CONCACAF Champions Cup: Vancouver Rise vs. Alianza, 10 p.m. ➡️ Paramount+ , CBS Sports Golazo Network ⚽ The Forward Line 🇺🇸 Pochettino finds depth after Pulisic injury in Australia win Getty Images This is all starting to motor along quite nicely, isn't it? If Friday's 1-1 draw with Ecuador showed the benefits of the 3-4-2-1 system then a come from behind win over Australia suggested that Mauricio Pochettino has a fair few options to plug into it. Six changes from the last starting lineup soon became seven after an early injury to Christian Pulisic , who suffered a suspected hamstring injury. Losing their best player is not something any manager would want, but in a friendly game it does at least allow the US to answer a question that they'd really rather not be addressing for the first time at the World Cup: who steps up if a key man goes down? The answer, on the basis of this game, is quite a few players. Most of all, what had long looked to be the problem position of the US setup could now be at least a spot where Pochettino does not have to worry himself too much. Haji Wright made sure of that, building on his outstanding form with Coventry City in the EFL Championship by scoring both goals on his first start under the current coaching setup. Folarin Balogun had thrown the gauntlet down for the other contenders with his performance against Ecuador. Wright responded and, as Pardeep Cattry noted in her dispatch from Commerce City, the real winner might be their head coach. You suspect the No.9 jersey will be Balogun's to lose for the time being. After all, it was the Monaco man who was given the run out against the toughest opposition. Still it is no great problem to have Wright waiting in the wings. The same is probably true of Cristian Roldon, who provided the assist for both of the US' goals last night. The 30-year-old was sidelined after featuring in the 2023 Gold Cup and you'd have to go even further back than that, probably to before the last World Cup, for the last time Roldon had a look in at a spot in the USMNT's strongest XI. Again, that might not have changed off the back of this friendly and a sprightly display against Japan last month. But Pochettino has made clear that he has no issue picking the best that MLS has to offer and that might just include Roldon, who will be looking to rival the likes of Tanner Tessman, Weston McKennie and Yunus Musah for a spot next to Tyler Adams next summer. That is some pretty robust depth there, the sort that didn't seem to be emerging in the early days of Pochettino's tenure. Now the Argentine feels there is time to pick and choose, to see which combinations work and who might be the blocks on whom he builds next summer. Pochettino: "" We've still a long time to the World Cup. It's open to every single USA player playing here or outside this country. They need to feel that. They need to feel the confidence from us, that when they come we're going to provide the possibility to play and show their quality... We have time to decide. This type of roster provided the possibility to see the combinations and assess in different ways."" All in all, then, an extremely successful international break. It would be unwise to get carried away just yet, certainly not when next month could bring a Uruguayan-shaped reality check on where the USMNT stand against the upper mid tier of international teams. Still the system is bedded in and has proven itself able to deal with shocks. That is not a bad place to be as 2025 approaches its end. Matchday 2 Today & Tomorrow! 🔗  Midfield Link Play 🇪🇺 Week two of the Champions League brings pressure for WSL Getty Images The first league phase of the women's Champions League is very much up and running and with a condensed six game schedule there really is no time like the present for some of Europe's biggest names to get results. That is particularly the case for two-thirds of the WSL contingent, who did not get the results they wanted last week. Even the other is about to face what could be a serious test of their aspirations. Holders Arsenal got their title defense up and running in exactly the wrong sort of fashion, an absorbing game against Lyon going the way of the visitors thanks to a fine double from Melchie Dumornay. Up next is a return to Lisbon, where the Gunners beat Barcelona to claim their second European crown, but this time they will be at Benfica 's Estadio Da Luz. The Eagles are heavy underdogs but pushed Juventus close in the first round of games and will believe they can trouble Renee Slegers' side, whose slump in form only partially eased with a 1-0 win over Brighton on Sunday. Before they play on Thursday it is the turn of another London side who should be aspiring for the top four and a bye to the quarterfinals. Chelsea did their chances of achieving that no favors with a draw away to Twente, one of several games this season where their finishing has deserted them. Twenty shots worth over three expected goals resulted only in Sandy Baltimore's 71st minute equaliser, a rough start to a fixture list that will get plenty tougher in the second half of the league phase. At home to Paris FC , Sonia Bompastor wants to see her side bear their teeth. Bompastor: ""If you look at the stats from our last six games, we are really good in possession, we are bringing the ball high up the pitch, bringing it into the box in different ways but the most difficult thing in football is to score goals. We need to stay confident and keep trying. Sometimes, when you're able to be clinical, you kill the opposition's hope a bit sooner."" Meanwhile the only one of the English teams to win in the first round of games face what might be the most intriguing clash of the second. Manchester United have been in freescoring form in the WSL this season with 16 goals in four wins and two draws. Set against them is an Atletico Madrid whose six goal drubbing of St Polten put them in the middle of a Spanish one, two, three at the top of the Champions League table. Fiamma has looked an exceptional striker in Spain and the Champions League this season, will she and her teammates be able to outscore the likes of Melvin Malard and Jess Park? With home advantage, you'd make Atleti slight favorites. 🔗  Top Stories 📺 How to follow UWCL: Want to keep up with all the drama of this week's Champions League games?

59b3a32db3e8,Are we all misremembering Baker Mayfield's journey? Let's get MVP candidate's story straight,"what teams were baker mayfield on, why did browns trade baker mayfield, why did mayfield not work out in carolina, how did mayfield land in carolina","Baker Mayfield is firmly within the MVP conversation more than a third of the way through the 2025 NFL season, and that makes for one of the most remarkable turnarounds for a player in recent NFL history considering the former No. 1 overall pick was dispatched by two teams not that long ago . While the story is spectacular, I believe there has been some misremembering of how we all got here. With the benefit of hindsight and excluding context, it is easy to say the Cleveland Browns should have never given up on Mayfield after four years. And it could be fair to jeer at the Carolina Panthers for not making it a year with Mayfield. But the truth is the NFL collective, given multiple chances over the course of the early 2020s, could have had Mayfield under their employ for a day-three draft pick or a base salary of $5 million. And several times over, other teams stuck with their aging veteran, or focused on the draft, or chose to spend their money elsewhere instead of on the former top pick who is now playing at an elite level for the 5-1 Buccaneers . Why Cleveland exiled Mayfield Let's get this out of the way early: the Browns are forever on the hook for what has become the worst trade in NFL history. Cleveland believed Deshaun Watson would be an upgrade at quarterback over Mayfield -- something just about every NFL talent evaluator would have agreed upon at the time -- and sent three first-round picks and more to Houston to sign Watson to the largest fully guaranteed contract in league history -- something not many across the league would have done at the time. Four years after being the top pick in Cleveland, Mayfield was immediately rendered expendable in March 2022 when the Browns made that transaction. He could no longer be a member of the Browns, and everyone knew it. The Browns, meanwhile, have gotten a handful of good games out of Watson's 19 starts, a couple season-ending injuries, a lot of embarrassment and a bevy of day-three picks spent on quarterbacks who have either proven they aren't the future or have the rest of this season to do so. How'd it get to the point where Mayfield couldn't stay in Cleveland after being taken with the top pick in 2018? Mayfield brought the first -- and, to this point, only -- playoff victory to this iteration of the Cleveland Browns in the playoffs following the 2020 season. That strong play encouraged GM Andrew Berry and the organization to exercise Mayfield's fifth-year option for the 2022 season. But 2021 was a miserable year for the Browns and continued Mayfield's up-and-down play across his rookie contract. Cleveland hovered around .500 most of the season as Mayfield played through injuries. Mayfield dealt with shoulder ailments through the year and, feeling the pressure of performing for a contract (according to sources), tried to grit his way through it. Odell Beckham Jr . more or less forced his way out of Cleveland in part thanks to his father sharing videos on social media of Mayfield not locating his wide-open son on the field. The Browns had to release Beckham, who went on to flourish with the Rams en route to a Super Bowl victory. Mayfield's personality, at times, clashed with people in the Browns building. When the wins aren't coming, that can rub people the wrong way. And Mayfield acknowledged as much years later, just this past week. ""Early on in my career it was 'cocky, immature.' Now it's 'moxie' and 'he's a dog,'"" Mayfield said last week. ""Same shit, different day. As long as you play well, they change the narrative, but you've just got to be yourself, and I've always been like that."" Had Cleveland not gotten Watson, it is very possible the Browns go into the 2022 season with Mayfield, in a make-or-break year, with emotions frayed on all sides and relationships fractured. Berry, the GM, had done his homework on all the draftable quarterbacks and even if Cleveland selected one, that rookie wouldn't have been a true challenge to Mayfield to start the year. Would Mayfield have had a season that commanded a long-term extension, or even a franchise tag? We'll never know. Cleveland made the ill-fated move for Watson in the 2022 offseason believing it had found a marked improvement at the position. And Mayfield was clearly on the trading block with an $18.858 million contract for the season. Few options for Mayfield on way out of Cleveland No one outside of Carolina seemed to want him. Go back to that offseason and revisit the moves, a real who's who of bad-to-mediocre quarterback play: Not even one of those players remains on those teams today. At that point the Panthers had been trying to figure out what to do without Cam Newton for three seasons. Hell, Carolina ran through so many options that it even brought Newton back hoping it would work again. Matt Rhule's Way of the Panther led Carolina to Mayfield, who had to eat some of his contract in order to facilitate the trade. The Browns also had to pay down some of his deal. The Panthers sent a conditional fifth-round pick to Cleveland to get Mayfield and pay less than $5 million of his salary. It took both sides until a few weeks before training camp for them to agree to terms, meaning Mayfield missed all of spring work. That's right. The top-two MVP candidate today had to take a paycut in order to be traded to the only other NFL team that wanted him three years ago. Mayfield battled with Sam Darnold for the starting job and won, but Carolina was not a good football team. Rhule was fired after Mayfield's fifth start and a 1-4 open, and Mayfield was sidelined with a high ankle sprain. By the time he came back, the Panthers had no offensive identity and eventually released him the first week of December. ""He wasn't the right offensive-wise and with the scheme,"" one coach on the Panthers staff tells CBS Sports. ""We traded for him in the summer right before training camp. He is more of a shotgun QB in my opinion, and we had him under center a lot."" Mayfield was dealing with off-field family issues during his abbreviated stint in Carolina. Getty Images A different Carolina source pointed to some personal turmoil Mayfield was dealing with at the time that eventually became public. Last year, Mayfield sued his father's company alleging a failure to repay millions of dollars stolen from him . According to the lawsuit, Mayfield had $12 million stolen from him between 2018 and 2021 by a company operated by his father and brother. That lawsuit was filed last November. ""He was dealing with that off the field… and the coaching change didn't help,"" a Panthers source said. Mayfield's brief flash with McVay The day after Carolina waived him, the Rams claimed Mayfield and gave him a crash course on the playbook with Matthew Stafford dealing with a spinal cord injury. When John Wolford was ineffective on Thursday Night Football against the Raiders, Sean McVay inserted Mayfield in a game that has since become legend. Mayfield won the game 17-16 over Las Vegas (though it didn't count as an official quarterback win since Wolford started) and has been used as a turning point in Mayfield's career. Indeed, Mayfield learned plenty under McVay, and the quarterback has credited McVay with helping him love the game again. But Mayfield would go 1-3 as a starter with the Rams -- who were also down Cooper Kupp and Aaron Donald down the stretch -- with their only win coming in the Christmas massacre of the Broncos that served as Nathaniel Hackett's final game as a head coach. With Stafford being the unquestioned leader of the Rams, and with Mayfield having higher aspirations than backup duty, a return to Los Angeles wasn't in the cards for the 2023 season. And so again, ahead of free agency and the draft, all NFL teams were aware that Mayfield was available. Mayfield not a slam-dunk Bucs starter The Buccaneers came calling after Tom Brady retired officially, again. They had Kyle Trask on the roster but needed more in the quarterback room. Tampa GM Jason Licht offered Mayfield a one-year, $4 million contract with some incentives to come to the Bucs and compete with Trask for the starting job ahead of the 2023 season. That's right. The top-two MVP candidate today had to split first-team reps two years ago with a player who, at that point, had nine career pass attempts and who today is not signed to a team. To Bucs coaches, Mayfield was clearly the better option. Some thought the ""competition"" was more due diligence than anything, considering Tampa had spent a second-round pick on Trask in 2021 when it was unclear how long Brady would keep playing. But Mayfield practiced poorly at times during that camp, according to sources. He threw several interceptions and had bad footwork as he settled into another new environment on a prove-it contract. We know what has happened since. Mayfield led the Bucs to the playoffs in 2023, was a play or two away from the NFC title game and wound up earning nearly $6.9 million when totaling incentives he reached. He went to the Pro Bowl that year for the first time in his career, and he signed a three-year contract worth up to $100 million with the Bucs in March 2023. Mayfield followed that up with another Pro Bowl and playoff season last year, setting career highs in completion percentage and passing touchdowns. He even registered on the NFL MVP voting with an 11th place finish. This year, with his third Bucs offensive coordinator in three years, Mayfield has put together four fourth-quarter game-winning comebacks and drives in six games. He has 12 passing touchdowns to just one interception, good for the best touchdown-to-interception ratio in the league through six weeks. And his 108.5 passer rating is the best of his career, all doing it without Mike Evans , Chris Godwin , Tristan Wirfs and Bucky Irving for some collection of games. Today the Bucs are at the top of the NFC and are 2 1/2 games up in the division in what would be a record five straight NFC South titles. If Mayfield remains on this trajectory, not only could an NFL MVP be in his sights, but league sources believe he will be in line for another major payday. The Buccaneers wouldn't want to go into the 2026 season with Mayfield in the final year of his deal that currently has a $51.9 million cap hit. What would be the going rate for a quarterback who has led two franchises to four separate postseasons in an NFL where one playoff win (or even appearance) can get you $50 million plus per year? Mayfield is 30 years old and his play is only getting better with each passing season. Cleveland drafted a great player in 2018 but it didn't work out in the long term. Who knows if Mayfield would be the MVP candidate he is today in Tampa had he stayed with the Browns over those years. Week 7 NFL QB Power Rankings: Buccaneers' Baker Mayfield the MVP favorite? Chiefs' Patrick Mahomes also rises Cody Benjamin The Browns and Panthers each had Mayfield and willingly let him go.

33229c19e1ce,‘DWTS’ Pro Pasha Pashkov Calls Carrie Ann Inaba’s Criticism on Dedication Night ‘Unfair’: ‘I Was Not Happy’,,"While “ Dancing With the Stars ” dedication night was filled with love and positivity, there were a few moments that left some of the pros feeling less than happy. Although Danielle Fishel and Pasha Pashkov ‘s jive during the Oct. 14 episode was filled with “Boy Meets World” nostalgia , judge Carrie Ann Inaba wasn’t impressed. “I love a throwback, but I have to say this. Some of your dances are starting to feel like I’m watching the same dance over and over again,” she said, receiving loud boos from the audience. “Try to give a little bit more variety as far as dynamics. This is also on you, Pasha.” Although Fishel has been vocal about wanting any feedback she can get from the judges, Pashkov wasn’t thrilled about the remark. “I was not happy. I always get protective. For me, that comment felt unfair, especially being that she said that the dances looked similar. But the thing is, we did have a quickstep and we had a jive this week. These are two dances that very, very similar,” he explained to Variety after the routine. “If we had dances that were drastically different and they felt the same, I’d understand. But, based on the dances that we had, that did not feel like it made sense to me. In my heart, I’m overprotective because I know how hard Danielle is working. I don’t think she deserved that comment.” Fishel added that she understood both Inaba’s comment and what Pashkov was saying. She also noted that her series premiere dance was a tango — a style that’s usually more serious. “My tango was a story about me overcoming breast cancer. It was also the first episode of ‘Dancing With the Stars’ where people were being introduced to me again. There was no way I was going to do my first week and not smile and show the way I was feeling,” said Fishel. “So I had a tango where I smiled, then I had a cha-cha where I smiled, then I had a quick step where I smiled, and now tonight, I had a jive where I was smiling. She’s not wrong… All I know is next week, it’s the perfect setup for our Argentine Tango.” Elaine Hendrix, Alan Bersten and Lisa Ann Walter Disney Pashkov wasn’t the only pro dancer surprised by the judges during dedication night. Alan Bersten was visibly upset when he and partner Elaine Hendrix received a score of 29 out of 40 for their foxtrot. After the cameras stopped rolling, he angrily walked out of the skybox before coming back up and reassuring Hendrix that she did a great job. “I think Elaine absolutely crushed it, and I’m so proud of her. It’s a tough competition, and I want her to know that she’s doing a good job,” he told Variety . “I was shocked [by the 7s]. I see Elaine working so hard every single day, and we don’t see votes. We only get the quick feedback from the judges, and I respect them. I thought she did a great job.” “Dancing With the Stars” airs on ABC and Disney+ on Tuesdays, and streams the next day on Hulu.",https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/dancing-with-the-stars-pasha-pashkov-carrie-ann-inaba-criticism-1236553209,Entertainment,variety.com,Emily Longeretta,https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/179544_EM208124.jpg?w=1000&h=563&crop=1,2025-10-15T18:12:31+00:00,f84b8e3b85b267c4f1978b48f7fa45fe7b6914c2
a550515ccd24,‘Woodpeckers’ Filmmaker José María Cabral Ventures Into Dark Comedy With Upcoming ‘Gut Feelings’ (EXCLUSIVE),,"In what would be his first foray into dark comedy, the Dominican Republic’s José María Cabral, who has represented his country three times at the Oscars with “Checkmate,” “ Woodpeckers ” and “The Projectionist,” is set to start shooting “Gut Feelings” (“Come mierda”) at Lantica Studios , with production VP Rafael Elías Muñoz leading the production. Said Cabral: “A director friend once told me: ‘you’re always making your first movie.’ And even though I’ve directed many projects, I like to see this dark comedy as if it were my first time. It’s a genre I hadn’t explored, but one that excites me deeply because it allows me to confront serious themes through absurdity and humor.” The story is set in a wealthy household which is consumed by only one objective: keeping little Isabella alive. She survives on a strict diet, watched over by her mother, Verónica, who clings to control like it’s the only thing holding her together. Her father, Raúl, once a hopeful biotechnologist, now pours his fear into strange, homemade cures no one else trusts. Only Abi, the young nanny, can make the sickly girl smile. Then, Raúl discovers a strange microbiotic “cure” that seems to heal Isabella. Against all odds, it works—and Abi suddenly finds herself at the heart of the family’s fragile new hope. But the miracle comes at a cost. As obsession grows and loyalties shift, the house begins to crack from the inside, pushing everyone to the edge. “‘Gut Feelings’ speaks about class, power and the invisible labor that sustains our societies, topics that, while rooted in a Dominican household, feel universal. I believe this story, with its mix of discomfort and laughter, has the potential to resonate internationally,” said Cabral who, will be mainly shooting at Lantica Studios and around Santo Domingo starting Oct. 23. The cast is led by Spanish actor Fele Martínez, known for his roles in such prominent Spanish titles as Alejandro Amenábar’s “Thesis” and “Open Your Eyes,” Pedro Almodóvar’s “Bad Education” and Netflix hit “Alpha Males.” He is joined by Dominican talents Cindy Galán, Lizbeth Santos, Isabel Spencer and Frank Perozo. Behind the camera, the project features Sarah Pérez Báez as line producer, Luis Enrique Carrión as director of photography and a screenplay by Miguel Yarull and Natalia Peralta, based on an original idea by Cabral himself. Said Elías Muñoz: “We continue to be inspired by José María’s fearless storytelling. With ‘Gut Feelings,’ he’s once again set to deliver a bold and original vision that is both deeply human and socially resonant. We’re proud to continue supporting his vision.” Lantica Studios previously backed “Hotel Coppelia” and Miami Film Festival audience awardee “Parsley” (“Perejil”). The former was picked up by HBO Max and Sony Pictures Latin America. A key driving force behind the rise of local filmmaking in the Caribbean, Lantica Studios has been steadily producing two to three original films a year for over a decade. As the leading provider of studio and production services in the Caribbean and Latin America, Lantica has hosted productions from major studios, including Netflix, Amazon, NBCUniversal, Paramount, HBO and Lionsgate. The studio also runs the country’s sprawling horizon water tank facility. Previously known as Pinewood Dominican Republic Studios, it was renamed Lantica Studios in May 2024 after Pinewood Studios sold its minority stake to the Dominican-owned Lantica Media.",https://variety.com/2025/film/global/woodpeckers-jose-maria-dark-comedy-gut-feelings-1236552144,Entertainment,variety.com,Anna Marie de la Fuente,https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Jose_Maria-03-e1760413813347.jpg?w=1000&h=563&crop=1,2025-10-15T18:08:54+00:00,eb91df97890627fc6d346e63a773bbd62a06f729
71a8a1538886,"Creators of ‘KPop Demon Hunters,’ ‘The Bad Guys,’ ‘In Your Dreams’ and ‘The Willoughbys’ Take on the Future of Storytelling",,"TURIN, Italy — A full day at the View Conference in Turin ended with animation directors from DreamWorks , Netflix and Sony Pictures Animation discussing how technology, fan engagement and soul are reshaping how stories are made and shared. Moderated by Dan Sarto, the Future of Storytelling panel featured Pierre Perifel (“The Bad Guys 2”), Maggie Kang and Chris Appelhans (“KPop Demon Hunters”), Alex Woo (“In Your Dreams”), Kris Pearn (“The Willoughbys”) and Camille Balsamo-Gillis, co-founder of Pro Machina. Game Engines Change the Game For these storytellers, real-time technology is rewriting the grammar of animation. “Cameras have always been a character, now we can actually manifest that very quickly,” said Pearn, describing how Unreal Engine has transformed production speed and flexibility. Kang said her “KPop Demon Hunters” team expected to use Unreal for only a small portion of the film. “We were told we’d only use 20% of the movie that way, it ended up being all of it,” she said. “You’re able to shoot coverage you were never really able to do before.” Balsamo-Gillis, whose company specializes in miniatures and practical effects, urged a balance between physical and digital. “There are still a lot of practical solutions,” she said. “There’s something unmatched about working with a physical, real asset.” Perifel agreed: “If ‘F1’ wasn’t shot the way they shot it, driving actual cars, that movie wouldn’t be what it is. You can see it on screen.” A Music Industry Moment? Appelhans compared today’s animation landscape to music’s digital revolution. “It’s analogous to what’s happened in the music industry,” he said. “Billie Eilish and her brother started out without a huge label, making music that found an audience on Spotify. We may see animation have its own music moment, undercutting the old production model in interesting ways.” He said streaming and new platforms have lowered barriers for smaller teams “with talent and dedication to find an audience” — much like musicians started doing 15 years ago online. Fans Are Your Marketing Team “KPop Demon Hunters” cultural takeover offered a real-world example of fan-driven success. “Our core audience were teens to early 20-somethings and they’re content makers,” said Kang. “They marketed the movie. It created a global buzz you could never get with staggered theatrical releases.” Appelhans added, “You would see fan made content and then you would see the studio put promotional work out there, and for whatever reason, the audience aren’t so sure, they can smell it… fans started owning your movie… it’s more raw and persuasive.” Woo called that two-way exchange essential to the next phase of storytelling. “Part of the future of storytelling is interaction with the fan base, a conversation happening between creators and audiences,” he said. Animation Remains a Medium, Not a Genre! Woo said younger audiences no longer see animation as “for kids” like many older audiences stubbornly do. “Every time I talk to young people, they don’t see animation or cartoons as for children,” he said. “They’ve experienced stories that are broader in tone and theme. Those barriers don’t exist for them anymore.” Perifel pointed to anime’s influence: “In Japan, animation is for everybody. It’s a Western reflex — maybe even more American than European — to think of it as children’s entertainment,” he said. “In animation, you can really do whatever you want. That’s what makes it exciting for the next generation.” Paying Attention to Where Audiences Are Audiences haven’t disappeared, rather they have dispersed and fragmented into a myriad of content silos. “Cable was a captive audience,” Pearn said of his early years in Canada. “That’s gone. Where the audience goes, that’s what we have to pay attention to.” He warned that while monetization remains difficult, the democratization of distribution means “really funny, smart, awesome filmmakers are gonna win.” The Industry Has Handled Huge Shifts Before When discussion turned to AI, Pearn recalled earlier upheavals. “Coming up as a 2D animator, I saw {Autodesk} Maya take most people’s jobs, half the studio was gone,” he said. “We can only look to ourselves as creatives to push back.” Others echoed that sentiment while differentiating human creativity from automation. “It’s like the iPhone camera; everyone has one, but most of what’s made no one watches,” said Woo. “It’s not the tool, it’s how you use it.” Perifel agreed: “AI doesn’t speak to any of us. What connects people is the human voice behind the work.” The loudest applause went to Chris Applehans who described the human labor generative models have trained on to give them their abilities as “one of the greatest acts of shoplifting you’ll ever see in human history. And so even an AI tool that’s helping you rotate a drawing into a 3D model is using the last 40 years of CG modellers who developed those abilities? It [the model training] just took all that and swallowed it all,” before continuing “and it doesn’t belong to these companies, and they’re so excited for us to move past that and just start talking about what the tool can do. But the truth is that that is the theft of millions of artists and their work. In my opinion, there needs to be a much more responsible reckoning of how that has happened, and how people can be remunerated for it. And then it will be a lot more comfortable to go forward with this as a tool. Just synthesising a century or two of humans figuring stuff out, but you can’t just steal that shit and then move right on.” There was mutual belief that storytelling talent will find a way to be found and still succeed but it’s clear the route and the methods may change. “Art is something unique to human beings because it comes from the soul,” Woo said to close the session. When asked where she sees herself in 10 years, Kang smiled: “I’d like to just keep making weird things and putting weird stuff on screen.”",https://variety.com/2025/film/global/view-conference-future-of-storytelling-animation-1236553750,Entertainment,variety.com,Callum McLennan,https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/KpopDemonHunters_ProRes422HQ_SDR_2ch_20250424.00_06_07_19-1.jpg?crop=0px%2C28px%2C1206px%2C679px&resize=1000%2C563,2025-10-15T18:05:02+00:00,c623dcb876576391ba4a7caa705b61e5da9440a1

d8f9cca566f3,Esai Morales Reflects on Resilience and Latino Unity and Pepe Aguilar Celebrates Authenticity in Music at Aspen Institute Latinos and Society Gala,,"Actor Esai Morales took center stage Monday night at the Aspen Institute Latinos & Society Program gala, holding back tears as he reflected on his four-decade journey in Hollywood, one rooted in resilience, cultural pride and authenticity. The award-winning actor, best known for roles in films such as “La Bamba” and “Bad Boys,” along with TV series like “Ozark,” “NYPD Blue” and “Criminal Minds,” was honored alongside legendary musician Pepe Aguilar with Variety’s Changemakers Award, which recognizes Hispanic and Latino icons shaping the future of film, television and music. “We have so much in common,” Morales said during a conversation moderated by Clayton Davis, Variety’s chief awards editor. “We focus on our differences sometimes a little too much because we are pitted against each other every single day, and I don’t like it. The best thing we can do is identify with each other and love each other.” In a video montage preceding his award, highlights from Morales’ career were showcased, including his most recent role in Paramount Pictures’ “Mission: Impossible — Dead Reckoning” and his upcoming appearance in the sci-fi thriller “War Machine,” directed by Patrick Hughes. But it was his breakout performance in the 1983 film “Bad Boys” that he credited for launching his Hollywood career — a pivotal moment when he nearly gave up. “I walked out and pushed the down button on the elevator,” he recalled of almost leaving the audition after waiting several hours. “Something inside of me said, ‘Get back in there. You don’t quit. Your mama didn’t raise you like that. You fight.’” While accepting his honor, Morales expressed deep gratitude for the opportunity to represent his Puerto Rican and Caribbean roots on screen — and for being embraced by the broader Latino community, especially Mexican Americans. He called for unity among Latinos everywhere. Aguilar, a multi-Grammy and Latin Grammy Award-winning musician, was also celebrated for his cultural impact and innovation in Latin music. With 35 albums to his name, he is known for blending traditional Mexican music with contemporary sounds in hits such as “Prometiste,” “Tu Sangre En Mi Cuerpo” and “Por Mujeres Como Tú.” “Making an album is not hard for me, but to remain truthful is,” Aguilar said in a live video conversation from Mexico. “The industry wants to take you to places that probably don’t fit you very much. I have to stay strong, stand my ground and keep doing what I love regardless of what’s happening. That is one of the hardest parts.” Aguilar, who has spent decades honoring Mexican folklore, mariachi and bomba, spoke about the evolution of his relationship with music — and how his passion has deepened with time. “Music has been my partner in all my adventures, and it’s no different right now,” he said. “I enjoy making music, especially now that I understand that it’s bigger than me. This is the music that I learned when I was a kid. I adore and admire Mexican folklore music. At this stage in my life, I enjoy it more than ever.” The gala, held in West Hollywood during Hispanic Heritage Month, marked the 10th anniversary of the Aspen Institute Latinos & Society Program. The organization aims to spotlight how American Latinos are driving economic growth and influencing national policy. Live entertainment was provided by Andy Abad’s band, “The Blue Agave.” Additional honorees included Nathalie Rayes, former U.S. ambassador to Croatia, and Monica Lozano, co-founder and chair of The LA Local. Both women were recognized for their leadership, advocacy and critical roles in founding the Aspen Institute Latinos & Society Program. The evening also featured the unveiling of the institute’s new logo and brand identity, Aspen Conexion, and marked the end of executive director Domenika Lynch’s impeccable tenure. Lynch will begin her new role as general manager of El Pueblo de Los Angeles Historical Monument, working under Mayor Karen Bass later this month. The gala concluded the Aspen Institute Latinos & Society Game Changers in Sports and Business Summit, a multi-day event that brought together more than 150 C-suite executives across industries to explore how sports can drive innovation, job creation and inclusive economic growth.",https://variety.com/2025/biz/awards/esai-morales-pepe-aguilar-aspen-institute-latinos-gala-1236553011,Entertainment,variety.com,Giana Levy,https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/10-13-25-DJH04156.jpg?w=1000&h=563&crop=1,2025-10-15T17:58:11+00:00,df6c88fa99c31b4d51f86d9bfeb55cc835702927
6f8b9354524f,Box Office: ‘Black Phone 2’ Targets Debut Above $20 Million as Sluggish October Continues,,"Will “ The Black Phone 2 ” end Blumhouse’s downtrodden box office streak? The horror sequel, again starring Ethan Hawke as the serial killer known as the Grabber, is targeting a debut of $23 to $29 million from 3,200 North American theaters. Since pre-release tracking has wildly missed the mark in recent weeks, studio sources are conservatively suggesting an $18 million opening weekend. Universal is distributing the $30 million-budgeted film. Though a wide range, projections are similar to the first “Black Phone,” which opened to $23 million in 2021 as theaters were just starting to recover from COVID. That film became a breakout hit with $161 million globally. Blumhouse could use a win on that scale. The horror empire behind scary-profitable hits like “Paranormal Activity,” “The Purge,” “Get Out” and “Halloween” is enduring a rare bumpy patch in theaters. Misfires in 2025 include January’s “Wolf Man” ($34 million against a $25 million budget), March’s “The Woman in the Yard” ($23 million against a $12 million budget), April’s “Drop” ($28 million against an $8 million budget), and June’s “M3GAN 2.0” ($39 million against a $25 million budget). As part of its business model, Blumhouse avoids major financial disasters by keeping costs low. But the company, which partners with Universal to distribute most of its films, is hoping that “The Black Phone 2” and this December’s “Five Nights at Freddy’s 2” will help restore its luster. “The Black Phone 2” should easily lead the domestic box office over last weekend’s champion, Disney’s sci-fi sequel “Tron: Ares,” as well as another newcomer, Aziz Ansari’s supernatural comedy “ Good Fortune .” Released by Lionsgate, “Good Fortune” is aiming for $6 million to $8 million from 2,985 theaters. The well-reviewed film cost $30 million. Ansari, best known for “Parks and Recreation” and Netflix’s “Master of None,” wrote and directed “Good Fortune,” which is his first feature film. (The multi-hyphenate was meant to make his directorial debut with Searchlight’s “Being Mortal,” which was infinitely suspended in 2022 over complaints about actor Bill Murray’s inappropriate behavior on set.) He also stars alongside Keanu Reeves, Seth Rogen and Keke Palmer. “Good Fortune” revolves around a good-intentioned but inept angel (Reeves) who facilitates a body swap between a struggling gig worker (Ansari) and a wealthy venture capitalist (Rogen). Variety’s chief film critic Peter Debruge singled out the performance of Reeves , whom he’s dubbed “this movie’s MVP,” adding that “beneath the jokes, ‘Good Fortune’ serves as a working-class critique of contemporary capitalism.” Overall, this weekend looks to extend a sluggish October at the box office. With the Warner Bros. video game adaptation “Mortal Kombat II” moving to 2026, movie theater attendance isn’t expected to pick up until much later in the fall season when Disney’s extraterrestrial adventure “Predator: Badlands,” Lionsgate’s heist thriller “Now You See Me: Now You Don’t,” Universal’s musical adaptation “Wicked: For Good” and Disney’s animated sequel “Zootopia 2” make their way to the big screen. “The industry will have to wait for the holiday season to start and the big November and December titles to deliver big box office results,” says Comscore’s head of marketplace trends Paul Dergarabedian.",https://variety.com/2025/film/box-office/black-phone-2-box-office-opening-weekend-estimates-1236552821,Entertainment,variety.com,Rebecca Rubin,https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/black-phone-2.jpg?w=1000&h=562&crop=1,2025-10-15T17:55:53+00:00,3899bed8991e15ce16c16ab7ccdf5290ee30cd18
5ecee8fc3b77,"Voiced by Jake Gyllenhaal, Jamie Lee Curtis and Brian Cox, True Crime Doc Feature ‘Raoul Wallenberg: Missing Inaction,’ Closes First Sales to Australia, Sweden, Israel (EXCLUSIVE)",,"CANNES, France — Featuring voiceovers by Jake Gyllenhaal, Jamie Lee Curtis and Brian Cox – reading out letters from Raoul Wallenberg, his mother Maj von Dardel and grandfather Gustaf Wallenberg –  true crime doc feature “Raoul Wallenberg: Missing Inaction,” produced by Jeff Sagansky and co-produced and sold by Erik Barmack’s Wild Sheep Content, has secured its earliest sales, closing Australia, Sweden and Israel. In Australia, public broadcaster SBS is set to release “Missing Inaction” later in 2025. Swedish state broadcaster SVT and Israeli cable service HOT have shown the film. More territories are under negotiation, Barmack told Variety . That is hardly surprising. The figure of Wallenberg, and what he achieved, still moves down the decades when known, though he risks falling into oblivion. “There are generations who know of Raoul Wallenberg’s life, deeds and incredible legacy, but to modern generations, he is a completely unknown figure from a forgone era,” said director Brad Rothschild. “We battled to get this film made so Raoul Wallenberg’s story and the magnitude of his accomplishments are never forgotten. Now, more than ever, stories like his need to be told.” Early stretches of “Raoul Wallenberg: Missing Inaction” are dedicated, naturally enough, to these accomplishments. A scion of one of Sweden’s most powerful families, the Wallenbergs who owned some 40% of the country’s industry in the early 20th century, Wallenberg was born in Sweden in 1912, but moved to Budapest in July 1944 to lead a humanitarian mission, championed covertly by President Franklin Roosevelt’s Refugee Board. Wallenberg arrives five months after Nazi forces had begun to deport some 437,000 Jews from outside Budapest to camps such as Auschwitz. Taking advantage of Sweden’s neutral status in WWII, Wallenberg designed and issued 5,000 Shutzpasses, turning Hungarian Jews into Swedish citizens. He then went on to forge up to 20,000 more, bought protected houses for Jews, ran supplies and a hospital and arrived in person to pull Jews from death marches to extermination camps in Austria. His salvation is described in the doc-feature as the biggest rescue operation of Jews in WWII. “Everybody that I have met had a story of Wallenberg – either saving them or saving relatives. He was the co-ordinator, the master conductor of humanity,” says Frank Vajda, saved by Wallenberg at age 9. Brian Cox, Jake Gyllenhaal, Jamie Lee Curtis on Why They Boarded ‘Raoul Wallenberg: Missing Inaction’ “Raoul Wallenberg took a stand to protect innocent victims and for humanity,” echoed Cox, who plays Jacob Wallenberg, who thought the world of his grandson, dreaming of his having. A brilliant banking career. Wallenberg “suffered the fate of many great figures in history who courageously did the right thing and paid dearly for it. Raoul Wallenberg is a man we must never forget, and I am humbled to be part of this film, telling his story and cementing his legacy,” Cox added. More intimate connections are often also at work explaining the involvement of its stellar cast and producer Alex Ruthizer, for whom “Raoul Wallenberg: Missing Inaction” has been a passion project. “As someone with both Jewish and Swedish roots, Raoul Wallenberg’s story has always held a deep, personal meaning for me,” said Gyllenhaal. “His courage – the way he risked everything to save thousands of lives – is something I profoundly admire. To have the chance to give voice to someone who made such a powerful impact, yet has remained largely unheard for so long, is an honor that I carry with a full heart.” “I am the proud granddaughter of Emmanuel Schwartz, my father Tony Curtis’s father. I am proud that my family’s name is linked to the restoration of Dohány Street Synagogue in Budapest. My great grandparents and grandparents and I hope my parents would both be very proud and pleased that I am aligning with the story of Raoul Wallenberg and his legacy, bravery and courage under fire. Today, this film and this story is crucial,” said Curtis. “I was inspired to make this documentary after discovering a deeply personal connection to Raoul Wallenberg; both he and I are University of Michigan alumni. And that connection went on to shape the project itself, as nearly our entire filmmaking team would also be Michigan graduates, equally inspired by Wallenberg’s sacrifice,” said producer Ruthizer. Ratcheting Up the True Crime Tension: What Happened to Wallenberg? In the doc feature, Curtis voices Wallenberg’s mother who, when he disappeared, seemingly without trace, dedicated her life to writing letters to the Swedish government, to Truman, even to Khrushchev, begging the then Soviet head of state to find him, or find out what happened to him. After 34 years of fruitless battle, Maj von Dardel and Fredrik von Dardel, Wallenberg’s step-father, committed suicide in 1979.  “They couldn’t take it any more,” says their great grandson in the doc-feature. Wallenberg was arrested under suspicion of being a U.S. spy, everybody agrees. “The question was not why he was arrested. The question is why he was not released,” says biographer Ingrid Carlberg, half way through “Raoul Wallenberg: Missing Inaction.” The doc feature is “like a modern crime series set in the world of WWII,” said Barmack. In true crime fashion, it entertains, to only finally discard, or build on several mystery solutions. One, the simplest, is that Wallenberg refused to be turned into a Soviet agent, signing his death sentence. Yet “Missing Inaction” hardly rests its case there. Another contention is that the Swedish government, not wanting to rock the boat with the not so-far-away Soviet Union, never did as much as they could to get Wallenberg back. The doc feature records a news report on Taj Erlander, Swedish prime minister during much of Wallenberg’s imprisonment, admitting as much, conceding that his government had failed one of its greatest citizens by not pressing hard for his release. Yet the most major explanation for Wallenberg’s fate lies elsewhere, and it is this that gives the doc feature its novelty and its powerful final half hour. “I’ve followed the Wallenberg mystery for years.  When I saw the new sources of information that the filmmakers had uncovered, I knew I had to support this project,” said Jeff  Sagansky. “Over the decades, countless books, biographies and films have explored the life and legacy of Raoul Wallenberg. But only ‘Missing Inaction’ shatters long-held myths to uncover the definitive truth,” said director Brian Mait. He added: “Drawing on more than a decade of our own extensive research, while building upon the work of those before us, our film delivers what history has long denied, closure to one of its greatest unsolved mysteries: the ultimate fate of Raoul Wallenberg.” The truth, and it is very cogent, delivers a sucker punch.",https://variety.com/2025/film/global/jake-gyllenhaal-jamie-lee-curtis-brian-cox-wallenberg-1236553722,Entertainment,variety.com,John Hopewell,https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/3-Split-27.jpg?w=1000&h=563&crop=1,2025-10-15T17:53:40+00:00,8379b47b8280b71dd8faa464c46bef22e66c07b7

Paltrow did not participate in the biography, but Odell drew from more than 200 interviews with people who know or have worked with the Oscar winner. The biography covered everything from Paltrow’s childhood to her love life and acting career, while addressing infamous allegations such as Paltrow allegedly stealing the “Shakespeare in Love” script from Winona Ryder. “She totally missed everything, the truth of who I am, what my impact is,” Paltrow told British Vogue about Odell’s biography, noting that she did not personally read it but her husband, Brad Falchuk, did. “He was like, ‘It’s just bad. It’s really badly written.’ I was like, ‘Ok.’ The stuff that I saw in People magazine, and [other outlets that picked it up], it was all rubbish, the things that I supposedly said.” “I think it’s very sexist. I was like, ‘Ok, hang on a sec. Why do the men get Walter Isaacson and I get this hack?’ You know?” Paltrow also quipped. Isaacson is an American journalist who has written the esteemed biographies of various figures such as Benjamin Franklin, Steve Jobs, Elon Musk and more. Although Paltrow did not read “Gwyneth: The Biography,” word did get back to her that the book included anonymous sources who criticized Paltrow’s company Goop and claimed her leadership inspired “chaos” internally. “That bothers me. ‘Oh, Goop has a toxic culture.’ That drives me insane because we have never had that,” Paltrow said. “Granted we’ve had a couple of toxic people and, because of my fear of confrontation, maybe I didn’t deal with it quickly enough. That does cascade down and I totally take responsibility for that. But we are such a good culture. We are . It’s something that I am so proud of and worked so hard on. “Of course, I’m going to say: ‘It’s not a toxic culture.’ Of course!” she added. “We are all human beings who go to work, sometimes with unresolved stuff and that comes out. People can have bad work experiences anywhere. But I can guarantee if I dropped you into the Goop office in Santa Monica, you’d be like: ‘What the fuck are these people talking about?’ You would see really engaged, really brilliant, highly collaborative teams who are excited. So I don’t like that kind of stuff – it impacts the team.” “Gwyneth: The Biography” made headlines over the summer with its many stories about the actor, including one that alleged Paltrow blocked Russell Crowe from being cast as her romantic interest in the film “A Perfect Murder” because they had previously had a fling. One source told Odell that Paltrow, who is returning to film acting later this year opposite Timothee Chalamet in “Marty Supreme,” only agreed to star in the A24 movie in order to boost visibility and sales at Goop.

97739b2ea099,Winning with misinformation: New research identifies link between endorsing easily disproven claims and prioritizing symbolic strength,"conspiracies, disinformation, misinformation, psychology, psychology research, steehm new research, strongmen","Why do some people endorse claims that can easily be disproved? It’s one thing to believe false information, but another to actively stick with something that’s obviously wrong. Our new research, published in the Journal of Social Psychology, suggests that some people consider it a “win” to lean in to known falsehoods . We are social psychologists who study political psychology and how people reason about reality. During the pandemic, we surveyed 5,535 people across eight countries to investigate why people believed COVID-19 misinformation, like false claims that 5G networks cause the virus. The strongest predictor of whether someone believed in COVID-19-related misinformation and risks related to the vaccine was whether they viewed COVID-19 prevention efforts in terms of symbolic strength and weakness. In other words, this group focused on whether an action would make them appear to fend off or “give in” to untoward influence. This factor outweighed how people felt about COVID-19 in general, their thinking style and even their political beliefs. Our survey measured it on a scale of how much people agreed with sentences including “Following coronavirus prevention guidelines means you have backed down” and “Continuous coronavirus coverage in the media is a sign we are losing.” Our interpretation is that people who responded positively to these statements would feel they “win” by endorsing misinformation – doing so can show “the enemy” that it will not gain any ground over people’s views. When meaning is symbolic, not factual Rather than consider issues in light of actual facts, we suggest people with this mindset prioritize being independent from outside influence. It means you can justify espousing pretty much anything – the easier a statement is to disprove, the more of a power move it is to say it, as it symbolizes how far you’re willing to go. When people think symbolically this way, the literal issue – here, fighting COVID-19 – is secondary to a psychological war over people’s minds. In the minds of those who think they’re engaged in them, psychological wars are waged over opinions and attitudes, and are won via control of belief and messaging. The U.S. government at various times has used the concept of psychological war to try to limit the influence of foreign powers, pushing people to think that literal battles are less important than psychological independence. By that same token, vaccination, masking or other COVID-19 prevention efforts could be seen as a symbolic risk that could “weaken” one psychologically even if they provide literal physical benefits. If this seems like an extreme stance, it is – the majority of participants in our studies did not hold this mindset. But those who did were especially likely to also believe in misinformation. In an additional study we ran that focused on attitudes around cryptocurrency, we measured whether people saw crypto investment in terms of signaling independence from traditional finance. These participants, who, like those in our COVID-19 study, prioritized a symbolic show of strength, were more likely to believe in other kinds of misinformation and conspiracies, too, such as that the government is concealing evidence of alien contact. In all of our studies, this mindset was also strongly associated with authoritarian attitudes, including beliefs that some groups should dominate others and support for autocratic government. These links help explain why strongman leaders often use misinformation symbolically to impress and control a population. Attempts to debunk misinformation look weak to someone who values a symbolic show of strength, while standing by a disprovable statement seems powerful. Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images Why people endorse misinformation Our findings highlight the limits of countering misinformation directly, because for some people, literal truth is not the point. For example, President Donald Trump incorrectly claimed in August 2025 that crime in Washington D.C. was at an all-time high, generating countless fact-checks of his premise and think pieces about his dissociation from reality. But we believe that to someone with a symbolic mindset, debunkers merely demonstrate that they’re the ones reacting, and are therefore weak. The correct information is easily available, but is irrelevant to someone who prioritizes a symbolic show of strength. What matters is signaling one isn’t listening and won’t be swayed. In fact, for symbolic thinkers, nearly any statement should be justifiable. The more outlandish or easily disproved something is, the more powerful one might seem when standing by it. Being an edgelord – a contrarian online provocateur – or outright lying can, in their own odd way, appear “authentic.” Some people may also view their favorite dissembler’s claims as provocative trolling, but, given the link between this mindset and authoritarianism, they want those far-fetched claims acted on anyway. The deployment of National Guard troops to Washington, for example, can be the desired end goal, even if the offered justification is a transparent farce. Is this really 5-D chess? It is possible that symbolic, but not exactly true, beliefs have some downstream benefit, such as serving as negotiation tactics, loyalty tests, or a fake-it-till-you-make-it long game that somehow, eventually, becomes a reality. Political theorist Murray Edelman, known for his work on political symbolism , noted that politicians often prefer scoring symbolic points over delivering results – it’s easier. Leaders can offer symbolism when they have little tangible to provide.",https://theconversation.com/winning-with-misinformation-new-research-identifies-link-between-endorsing-easily-disproven-claims-and-prioritizing-symbolic-strength-265652,Society,theconversation.com,Abraham Rutchick,https://images.theconversation.com/files/695729/original/file-20251010-56-vaw3s0.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&rect=0%2C328%2C6000%2C3000&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop,2025-10-15T12:53:34+00:00,18f98b64acf9bc66c16e1a4014cc37285dc0b14b

However, relaxation and scenic beauty had nothing to do with the origins of this waterway. When the Erie Canal opened 200 years ago, on Oct. 26, 1825, the route was dotted with decaying trees left by construction that had cut through more than 360 miles of forests and fields, and life quickly sped up. Mules on the towpath along the canal could pull a heavy barge at a clip of 4 miles per hour – far faster than the job of dragging wagons over primitive roads. Boats rushed goods and people between the Great Lakes heartland and the port of New York City in days rather than weeks . Freight costs fell by 90%. An 1840 map of the Erie Canal. New York State/Wikimedia As many books have proclaimed, the Erie Canal’s opening in 1825 solidified New York’s reputation as the Empire State . It also transformed the surrounding environment and forever changed the ecology of the Hudson River and the lower Great Lakes. For environmental historians like me, the canal’s bicentennial provides an opportunity to reflect upon its complex legacies, including the evolution of U.S. efforts to balance economic progress and ecological costs. Human and natural communities ruptured The Haudenosaunee Confederacy , the Indigenous nations that the French called the Iroquois , engaged in canoe-based trade throughout the Great Lakes and Hudson River valley for centuries. In the 1700s, that began to change as American colonists took the land through brutal warfare , inequitable treaties and exploitative policies . That Haudenosaunee dispossession made the Erie Canal possible. Haiwhagai'i Jake Edwards of the Onondaga Nation describes the Erie Canal’s impact on the people of the Haudenosaunee Confederacy. WMHT. After the Revolutionary War, commercial enthusiasm for a direct waterborne route to the West intensified. Canal supporters identified the break in the Appalachian Mountains at the junction of the Mohawk River and the Hudson as a propitious place to dig a channel to Lake Erie . Yet cutting a 363-mile-long waterway through New York’s uneven terrain posed formidable challenges. Because the landscape rises 571 feet between Albany and Buffalo, a canal would require multiple locks to raise and lower boats. An 1839 view looking eastward from the top lock at Lockport, N.Y., where a series of five locks raised the Erie Canal about 60 feet. Hulton Archive/Getty Images Federal officials refused to finance such “ internal improvements .” But New York politician DeWitt Clinton was determined to complete the project, even if it meant using only state funds. Critics mocked the $7 million megaproject , worth around US$170 million today , calling it “DeWitt’s Ditch” and “Clinton’s Folly.” In 1817, however, thousands of men began digging the 4-foot-deep channel using hand shovels and pickaxes. The construction work produced engineering breakthroughs , such as hydraulic cement made from local materials and locks that lifted the canal’s water level about 60 feet at Lockport, yet it obliterated acres of wetlands and forests. After riding a canal boat between Utica and Syracuse, the writer Nathaniel Hawthorne described the surroundings in 1835 as “now decayed and death-struck.” However, most canalgoers viewed the waterway as a beacon of progress . As a trade artery, it made New York City the nation’s financial center . As a people mover, it fueled religious revivals , social reform movements and the growth of Great Lakes cities .

Detroit Publishing Company/Library of Congress The Erie Canal’s socioeconomic benefits came with more environmental costs: The passageway enabled organisms from faraway places to reach lakes and rivers that had been isolated since the end of the last ice age. An invasive species expressway On Oct. 26, 1825, Gov. Clinton led a flotilla aboard the Seneca Chief from Buffalo to New York City that culminated in a grandiose ceremony. To symbolize the global connections made possible by the new canal, participants poured water from Lake Erie and rivers around the world into the Atlantic at Sandy Hook, a sand spit off New Jersey at the entrance to New York Harbor. Observers at the time described the ritual of “ commingling the waters of the Lakes with the Ocean ” in matrimonial terms. An artist’s image of DeWitt Clinton mingling the waters of Lake Erie with the Atlantic after officially opening the canal in 1825. Philip Meeder, wood-engraver, 1826, New York Public Library via Wikimedia Commons Clinton was an accomplished naturalist who had researched the canal route’s geology , birds and fish . He even predicted that the waterway would “ bring the western fishes into the eastern waters .” Biologists today would consider the “ Wedding of the Waters ” event a biosecurity risk . The Erie Canal and its adjacent feeder rivers and reservoirs likely enabled two voracious nonnative species, the Atlantic sea lamprey and alewife , to enter the Great Lakes ecosystem. By preying on lake trout and other highly valued native fish, these invaders devastated the lakes’ commercial fisheries . The harvest dropped by a stunning 98% from the previous average by the early 1960s. Sea lampreys – eel-like creatures with mouths like suction cups – cut the lake trout population by 98%, and most of the fish that survived had lamprey marks on them. These invasive species began appearing in the Great Lakes after the Erie Canal opened. T. Lawrence/NOAA Great Lakes , CC BY-SA Tracing their origins is tricky, but historical, ecological and genetic data suggest that sea lampreys and alewives entered Lake Ontario via the Erie Canal during the 1860s. Later improvements to the Welland Canal in Canada enabled them to reach the upper Great Lakes by the 1930s. Protecting the $5 billion Great Lakes fishery from these invasive organisms requires constant work and consistent funding . In particular, applying pesticides and other techniques to control lamprey populations costs around $20 million per year. The invasive species that has inflicted the most environmental and economic harm on the Great Lakes is the zebra mussel . Zebra mussels traveled from Eurasia via the ballast water of transoceanic ships using the St. Lawrence Seaway during the 1980s. The Erie Canal then became a “ mussel expressway ” to the Hudson River. The hungry invading mussels caused a nearly tenfold reduction of phytoplankton , the primary food of many species of the Hudson River ecosystem . This competition for food, along with pollution and habitat degradation, led to the disappearance of two common species of the Hudson’s native pearly mussels .

U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service Today, the Erie Canal remains vulnerable to invasive plants , such as water chestnut and hydrilla , and invasive animals such as round goby . Boaters, kayakers and anglers can help reduce bioinvasions by cleaning, draining and drying their equipment after each use to avoid carrying invasive species to new locations. A recreational treasure During the Gilded Age in the late 1800s, the Erie Canal sparked a utilitarian sense of environmental concern. Timber cutting in the Adirondack Mountains was causing so much erosion that the eastern canal’s feeder rivers were filling up with silt. To protect these waterways, New York created Adirondack Park in 1892. Covering 6 million acres, the park balances forest preservation, recreation and commercial use on a unique mix of public and private lands. Erie Canal shipping declined during the 20th century with the opening of the deeper and wider St. Lawrence Seaway and competition from rail and highways. The canal still supports commerce, but the Erie Canalway National Heritage Corridor now provides an additional economic engine. A kayak tour shows how locks operate on the Erie Canal. WMHT Public Media. The Erie Canal began with 83 locks, but improvements over time reduced the number to 35 locks today. NYS Department of Transportation via National Park Service In 2024, 3.84 million people used the Erie Canalway Trail for cycling, hiking, kayaking, sightseeing and other adventures . The tourists and day-trippers who enjoy the historic landscape generate over $300 million annually. Over the past 200 years, the Erie Canal has both shaped, and been shaped by, ecological forces and changing socioeconomic priorities. As New York reimagines the canal for its third century, the artificial river’s environmental history provides important insights for designing technological systems that respect human communities and work with nature rather than against it.",https://theconversation.com/erie-canals-200th-anniversary-how-a-technological-marvel-for-trade-changed-the-environment-forever-263320,Society,theconversation.com,Christine Keiner,https://images.theconversation.com/files/687310/original/file-20250825-76-kodscw.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&rect=0%2C954%2C4266%2C2133&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop,2025-10-15T12:53:18+00:00,c5ae88bafd0d17ec8c3f698271fc27bcb649b4e0
2409a072f799,Why higher tariffs on Canadian lumber may not be enough to stimulatelong-terminvestments in US forestry,"canada, donald trump, forestry, forestry industry, international trade, timber, us tariffs, lumber, timber production","Lumber, especially softwood lumber like pine and spruce, is critical to U.S. home construction. Its availability and price directly affect housing costs and broader economic activity in the building sector . The U.S. imports about 40% of the softwood lumber the nation uses each year , more than 80% of that from Canada . President Donald Trump says that the U.S. has the capacity to meet 95% of softwood lumber demand and directed federal officials to update policies and regulatory guidelines to expand domestic timber harvesting and curb the arrival of foreign lumber . On Sept. 29, 2025 , he announced new tariffs on imported timber and wood products, including an additional 10% tariff on Canadian lumber. Those were added to 35% tariffs imposed on Canadian lumber in August. It was the latest phase in a long-standing dispute over the supply of lumber to builders in the U.S., which dates back to the 1980s, when U.S. producers began arguing that Canadian companies were benefiting from unfair subsidies from their government. Starting on Oct. 15, Canadian softwood lumber imports could face tariffs exceeding 45% . As researchers studying the forestry sector and international trade , we recognize that the U.S. has ample forest resources. But replacing imports with domestic lumber isn’t as simple as it sounds. There are differences in tree species and quality, and U.S. lumber often comes at a higher cost, even with tariffs on imports. Challenges like limited labor and manufacturing capacity require long-term investments, which temporary tariffs and uncertain trade policies often fail to encourage. In addition, the amount of lumber imported tends to mirror the boom-and-bust cycles of housing construction, a dynamic that tariffs alone are unlikely to change. Trump’s moves To boost U.S. logging, in March, Trump issued an executive order telling the departments of Interior and Agriculture to ease what he called “ heavy-handed ” regulations on timber harvesting. The executive order and a follow-up memo from Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins do not spell out specifics, but officials say more details are in the works that will simplify the timber harvesting process, with the goal of boosting domestic timber production by 25% . That same month, Trump ordered the Commerce Department to assess how imports of timber, lumber and related wood products affect U.S. national security . While that assessment was underway, in July, the Commerce Department published findings from a trade review of 2023 Canadian lumber imports . That inquiry alleged that Canadian companies were selling lumber to the U.S. at unfairly low prices , potentially leaving U.S. producers with lower sales or depressed prices. That finding was cited as the basis for the 35% August tariff announcement. In its national security investigation initiated in March, the Commerce Department concluded that an overreliance on imported wood products means “ the United States may be unable to meet demands for wood products that are crucial to the national defense and critical infrastructure.” The September tariff announcement is based on those findings. Canadian timber harvesting continues, despite uncertainty about trade with the U.S. Artur Widak/NurPhoto via Getty Images Canadian lumber in the US market In 1991, the U.S. imported 11.5 billion board feet (27 million cubic meters) of Canadian lumber. Those imports rose to a high of 22 billion board feet (52 million cubic meters) by 2005. But as housing construction declined – especially during the Great Recession from 2007 to 2009 – imports dropped sharply, to less than 8.4 billion board feet (20 million cubic meters) in 2009. The current volume has not recovered to prerecession levels, rising only to 12 billion board feet (28 million cubic meters) in 2024. The value of Canadian lumber has also fluctuated. Historically, prices for Canadian lumber have averaged about US$330 per thousand board feet ($140 per cubic meter). During and after the COVID-19 pandemic, import prices soared to almost $800 per thousand board feet ($340 per cubic meter). But since peaking in 2021 and 2022, prices have dropped significantly to $436 per thousand board feet ($185 per cubic meter) by 2024. In total, in 2024, the U.S. imported more than $11 billion in forest and wood products from Canada. Softwood lumber accounted for almost half of that. Lumber and housing As personal income rises and populations grow, people seek to build new homes. As new home construction – called “ housing starts ” in economic data – increases, so does demand for softwood lumber to build those homes. And when housing starts slow, so does lumber demand. For instance, housing starts fell during the Great Recession. They declined from a January 2006 peak of 2.3 million to less than 500,000 in January 2009 – a decrease of nearly 80% . In that same period, imports of Canadian lumber fell by more than 60% . Domestic softwood lumber production fell by more than 40% . Both domestic and imported lumber prices can directly influence the overall cost of building homes, which in turn affects housing affordability . That said, lumber used for framing usually accounts for less than 10% of the total cost to build a new home . The effects of tariffs on new home construction may be significantly less than other factors, such as rising labor costs . There are different kinds of wood commonly used in building lumber. A matter of choice The U.S. has a lot of potential lumber available. Especially in the South, the inventory of harvestable lumber has grown significantly over many years. However, the types of wood available in the U.S. are not always the same as what’s available from Canadian imports. For framing, contractors may prefer spruce, northern pines and fir, naturally abundant in Canada, because they are lighter and less likely to warp than southern yellow pine, which is abundant in the southern U.S. Southern yellow pine is more commonly used to make utility poles and preservative-treated lumber for outdoor construction projects, such as decks. Lumber from Idaho, eastern Oregon and eastern Washington, however, does share characteristics with Canadian species and could take the place of at least some Canadian lumber.

Mayor Mike Duggan and the Detroit Police Department responded by introducing the Summer Teen Safety Violence Prevention Plan in July 2025. As part of the plan, city leaders promised to increase curfew enforcement. Year-round, teens must abide by curfews of 10 p.m. or 11.p.m., depending on their age. Also in July, the Detroit City Council voted to raise the fines parents will face if their children violate curfew to US$250 for a first offense and $500 for a second offense. Before the vote, parents were fined $75 for the first offense and $100 for the second , an amount that hadn’t been changed for decades. I am a developmental psychologist and associate professor in the School of Criminal Justice at Michigan State University, where I study how juvenile justice policy affects children and families. While the curfew and fines are designed to deter crime by encouraging parents to keep a closer eye on their kids, research suggests it could instead worsen economic hardship and existing inequities among vulnerable families. I believe that understanding youth crime through the lens of adolescent development offers communities more promising ways forward. Parents play key role Parents matter. Evidence shows strong parental involvement reduces youth crime. Parents who know what their children are doing , who their friends are and where they are spending their time are more likely to keep them out of criminal or dangerous situations. At the same time, adolescence is a period when young people work to develop independent identities . Research shows that parents balance this transition most effectively not through surveillance but through showing genuine interest in their children’s lives, setting fair boundaries and staying connected . Many people believe that teens value peers’ opinions more than their parents’. But the evidence shows that teens adopt the values and attitudes of caring parental figures, including their attitudes about the law . The fact that parents have such a strong influence over delinquency makes the question of legal parental responsibility particularly important. What does the law say? In the United States, parents may be held legally responsible for their children’s actions through civil and – in rare cases such as the Ethan Crumbley case – criminal liability . Crumbley’s parents were found guilty of involuntary manslaughter tied to a 2021 school shooting carried out by their son. Fines like the ones imposed on Detroit parents for their children’s curfew violations are usually status offenses – behaviors that are illegal only because of a child’s status as a minor. Examples include consistently missing school, running away, underage drinking and curfew violations. The goal of curfews is to prevent delinquency late in the evening, although a systemic review of relevant research suggests that youth curfews have no effect on crime . Detroit Police Chief Todd Bettison, center, and Mayor Mike Duggan, right, discuss increasing violence involving youth in the city. City of Detroit YouTube Channel When minors are charged with a status offense, parents are automatically implicated . However, the role that parents play legally varies by state . Some states, including Michigan, impose purely punitive sanctions such as fines or jail time. Others, like Connecticut , combine culpability with parental support programs. Do parental responsibility laws work? Despite widespread use, there’s little evidence to support the idea that parental responsibility laws deter delinquency. Instead, they may produce unintended harms. Three challenges limit their effectiveness. First, my own research finds that parents, particularly those from disadvantaged backgrounds , often lack knowledge of juvenile justice laws and processes. Parents cannot prevent or respond to violations they do not fully understand. Second, fining parents for curfew violations may put extra financial pressure on families that are already struggling. These fines are based on the idea that parents aren’t supervising their children well enough. In reality, even caring and attentive parents may not be able to stop a teenager from breaking curfew if they’re working late or juggling multiple jobs. Families that can least afford these fines are hit the hardest, making their financial situation even worse . On top of that, fines can damage relationships between parents and kids, and add stress and stigma to the household. Third, punishing parents with fines can make existing inequalities worse, since youth from disadvantaged backgrounds are more often cited for minor offenses such as curfew violations. These penalties especially affect single mothers of color who already face poverty , heavy policing in their community and accumulated disadvantage from loss of generational wealth after decades of earning lower incomes. Why do kids engage in crime? Finding appropriate solutions to youth crime necessitates understanding why youth engage in crime in the first place. Neuropsychological research shows that teens are more prone to risk-taking because their brains are still developing. This fact was acknowledged by the U.S. Supreme Court in Roper v. Simmons and Miller v. Alabama , which protect minors from execution and mandatory life sentences. Compared to adults, young people are less able to weigh long-term consequences, resist peer pressure, regulate emotions and control impulses. At the same time, their brains are especially sensitive to novelty and social rewards. This combination means that, in emotionally charged situations, teens may engage in risky or even harmful behavior despite potential consequences . What policies show promise? Policies are most effective when they align with developmental science. Research shows community-based programs , multisystemic therapy , risk-needs assessments and restorative justice work to reduce recidivism. These approaches involve family and community resources, strengthen skills for adult life, and foster accountability without the added harms of punitive sanctions. Positive parent-child relationships are critical to keep children out of crime. My research finds that high-quality parent-child relationships reduce first-offense recidivism, but the effect can erode with repeated offending . This work highlights the need for rehabilitative interventions that strengthen – rather than burden – parent-child relationships. For example, research finds that family-focused programs that teach parenting strategies improve youth outcomes during and after court involvement. Adolescents’ brains are still maturing, making them prone to impulsivity, sensation-seeking, and reward-driven behavior. While these tendencies can lead to harmful behavior such as crime, they can also take positive forms such as pushing limits in sports or getting on stage in the school play. Community-based programs that offer safe, supportive spaces can redirect youths’ natural risk-taking into positive outlets. Activities that capitalize on strengths , such as the arts, sports and clubs, foster belonging and purpose while reducing isolation and reliance on antisocial peers.",https://theconversation.com/detroit-parents-face-fines-if-their-children-break-curfew-research-shows-the-policy-could-do-more-harm-than-good-264175,Society,theconversation.com,Caitlin Cavanagh,https://images.theconversation.com/files/691967/original/file-20250919-56-woa9v0.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&rect=0%2C583%2C4664%2C2332&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop,2025-10-15T12:49:51+00:00,d9e045f9a778ffde1d23a37c738989a2594e8bd2
0b6e422beed0,Concerns aboutAI-writtenpolice reports spur states to regulate the emerging practice,"ai regulation, artificial intelligence (ai), body cameras, large language models, law enforcement, police, technology","Police are getting a boost from artificial intelligence, with algorithms now able to draft police reports in minutes. The technology promises to make police reports more accurate and comprehensive, as well as save officers time. The idea is simple : Take the audio transcript from a body camera worn by a police officer and use the predictive text capabilities of large language models to write a formal police report that could become the basis of a criminal prosecution. Mirroring other fields that have allowed ChatGPT-like systems to write on behalf of people, police can now get an AI assist to automate much dreaded paperwork. The catch is that instead of writing the first draft of your college English paper, this document can determine someone’s liberty in court. An error, omission or hallucination can risk the integrity of a prosecution or, worse, justify a false arrest. While police officers must sign off on the final version, the bulk of the text, structure and formatting is AI-generated. Who – or what – wrote it Up until October 2025, only Utah had required that police even admit they were using an AI assistant to draft their reports. On Oct. 10, that changed when California became the second state to require transparent notice that AI was used to draft a police report. Governor Gavin Newsom signed SB 524 into law , requiring all AI-assisted police reports to be marked as being written with the help of AI. The law also requires law enforcement agencies to maintain an audit trail that identifies the person who used AI to create a report and any video and audio footage used in creating the report. It also requires agencies to retain the first draft created with AI for as long as the official report is retained, and prohibits a draft created with AI from constituting an officer’s official statement. The law is a significant milestone in the regulation of AI in policing, but its passage also signifies that AI is going to become a major part of the criminal justice system. If you are sitting behind bars based on a police report, you might have some questions. The first question that Utah and California now answer is “Did AI write this?” Basic transparency that an algorithm helped write an arrest report might seem the minimum a state could do before locking someone up. And, even though leading police technology companies like Axon recommend such disclaimers be included in their reports, they are not required. Police departments in Lafayette, Indiana and Fort Collins, Colorado, were intentionally turning off the transparency defaults on the AI report generators, according to an investigative news report. Similarly, police chiefs using Axon’s Draft One products did not even know which reports were drafted by AI and which were not because the officers were just cutting and pasting the AI narrative into reports they indicated they wrote themselves. The practice bypassed all AI disclaimers and audit trails . The author explains the issues around AI-written police reports in an interview on CNN’s ‘Terms of Service’ podcast. Many questions Transparency is only the first step . Understanding the risks of relying on AI for police reports is the second . Technological questions arise about how the AI models were trained and the possible biases baked into a reliance on past police reports. Transcription questions arise about errors, omissions and mistranslations because police stops take place in chaotic, loud and frequently emotional contexts amid a host of languages. Finally, trial questions arise about how an attorney is supposed to cross-examine an AI-generated document, or whether the audit logs need to be retained for expert analysis or turned over to the defense. Risks and consequences The significance of the California law is not simply that the public needs to be aware of AI risks, but that California is embracing AI risk in policing. I believe it’s likely that people will lose their liberty based on a document that was largely generated by AI and without the hard questions satisfactorily answered. Worse, in a criminal justice system that relies on plea bargaining for more than 95% of cases and is overwhelmingly dominated by misdemeanor offenses, there may never be a chance to check whether the AI report accurately captured the scene. In fact, in many of those lower-level cases, the police report will be the basis of charging decisions, pretrial detention, motions, plea bargains, sentencing and even probation revocations. I believe that a criminal legal system that relies so heavily on police reports has a responsibility to ensure that police departments are embracing not just transparency but justice. At a minimum, this means more states following Utah and California to pass laws regulating the technology, and police departments following the best practices recommended by the technology companies. But even that may not be enough without critical assessments by courts, legal experts and defense lawyers. The future of AI policing is just starting, but the risks are already here.",https://theconversation.com/concerns-about-ai-written-police-reports-spur-states-to-regulate-the-emerging-practice-267410,Society,theconversation.com,Andrew Guthrie Ferguson,https://images.theconversation.com/files/696269/original/file-20251014-56-ml79ad.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&rect=0%2C670%2C4000%2C2000&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop,2025-10-15T12:48:39+00:00,d78452b4e16eabba32dbe5d9346e0b7ee2533149
8c3c676a770d,"Focused sound energy holds promise for treating cancer, Alzheimer’s and other diseases","acoustics, brain, cancer, cancer immunotherapy, drug delivery, immunotherapy, medical devices, medical technology, sound, ultrasound, blood-brain barrier","Sound waves at frequencies above the threshold for human hearing are routinely used in medical care . Also known as ultrasound, these sound waves can help clinicians diagnose and monitor disease, and can also provide first glimpses of your newest family members. And now, patients with conditions ranging from cancer to neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer’s may soon benefit from recent advances in this technology. I am a biomedical engineer who studies how focused ultrasound – the concentration of sound energy into a specific volume – can be fine-tuned to treat various conditions. Over the past few years, this technology has seen significant growth and use in the clinic. And researchers continue to discover new ways to use focused ultrasound to treat disease. A brief history of focused ultrasound Ultrasound is generated with a probe containing a material that converts electrical current into vibrations, and vice versa. As ultrasound waves pass through the body, they reflect off the boundaries of different types of tissue. The probe detects these reflections and converts them back into electrical signals that computers can use to create images of those tissues. Over 80 years ago, scientists found that focusing these ultrasonic waves into a volume about the size of a grain of rice can heat up and destroy brain tissue. This effect is analogous to concentrating sunlight with a magnifying glass to ignite a dry leaf. Early investigators began testing how focused ultrasound could treat neurological disorders, pain and even cancer. MRI of a patient treated for essential tremor using focused ultrasound, with the targeted part of the brain circled in red. Jmarchn/Wikimedia Commons , CC BY-SA Yet, despite these early findings, technical hurdles stood in the way of applying focused ultrasound in the clinic. For example, because the skull absorbs ultrasound energy, sending focusing beams with high enough energy to reach damaged brain tissue proved difficult. Researchers eventually overcame this problem by integrating large arrays of ultrasound transducers – the probes that convert between electrical signals and vibrations – with image-based information about skull shape and density. This change allowed researchers to better fine-tune the beams to their targets. It is only after scientists made key advances in imaging technology and acoustic physics in recent years that the promise of ultrasound is being realized in the clinic. Hundreds of clinical trials aimed at treating dozens of conditions have been completed or are ongoing. Researchers have found notable success on a condition called essential tremor , which leads to uncontrolled shaking, usually of the hands. Focused ultrasound treatments for essential tremor are now performed routinely at many locations around the world. I believe some of the most exciting applications for focused ultrasound include improving drug delivery to the brain, stimulating immune responses against cancer, and treating rare diseases of the central nervous system. Delivering drugs to the brain The blood-brain barrier is evolution’s exquisite solution to keeping noxious substances away from this most critical organ. The blood-brain barrier is comprised of very tightly connected cells lining the inside of blood vessels. It only allows certain types of molecules to enter the brain, protecting against pathogens and toxins. However, the blood-brain barrier is problematic when it comes to treating disease because it blocks therapies from reaching their intended target. More than 20 years ago, pioneering studies determined that sending low-intensity pulses of focused ultrasound could temporarily open the blood-brain barrier by causing microbubbles in blood vessels to oscillate. This oscillation pushes and pulls on the surrounding vessel walls, briefly opening tiny pores that allow drugs in the bloodstream to penetrate into the brain. Critically, the blood-brain barrier opens only where the focused ultrasound is applied. Focused ultrasound can allow drugs to reach targeted areas of the brain. After many years of testing the safety of this technique and improving control of ultrasound energy, researchers have developed several devices using focused ultrasound to open the blood-brain barrier for treatment. Clinical trials testing the ability of these devices to deliver drugs to the brain to treat conditions like glioblastoma , brain metastases and Alzheimer’s disease are underway. In parallel, there has been significant progress in developing gene therapies for numerous brain diseases. Gene therapy involves fixing or replacing faulty genetic material to treat a specific disease. Applying gene therapy to the brain is especially challenging because such therapies typically do not cross the blood-brain barrier. Animal studies have shown that using focused ultrasound to open the blood-brain barrier can facilitate the delivery of gene therapies to their intended targets in the brain, opening doors to testing this technique in people. Stimulating immune responses against cancer Cancer immunotherapy instructs the patient’s own immune system to fight the disease. However, many patients – especially those afflicted with breast cancer, pancreatic cancer and glioblastoma – have tumors that are immunologically “cold,” meaning they are unresponsive to traditional immunotherapies. Researchers have learned that focused ultrasound can destroy solid tumors in ways that allow the immune system to better recognize and destroy cancer cells . One way focused ultrasound does this is by turning tumors into debris that then literally flows to the lymph nodes. Once immune cells in the lymph nodes encounter this debris, they can initiate an immune response specifically against the cancer. Inspired by these breakthroughs, the University of Virginia started the world’s first focused ultrasound immuno-oncology center in 2022 to support research in this area and push the most promising approaches to the clinic. For example, my colleagues are running a clinical trial at the center to test the use of focused ultrasound and immunotherapy to treat patients with advanced melanoma . Treating rare diseases with focused ultrasound Research on focused ultrasound has primarily focused on the most devastating and prevalent diseases, such as cancer and Alzheimer’s disease. However, I believe that further developments in, and increased use of, focused ultrasound in the clinic will eventually benefit patients with rare diseases. One rare disease of particular interest for my lab is cerebral cavernous malformation, or CCM . CCMs are lesions in the brain that occur when the cells that make up blood vessels undergo uncontrolled growth. While uncommon, when these lesions grow and hemorrhage, they can cause debilitating neurological symptoms . The most common treatment for CCM is surgical removal of the brain lesions; however, some CCMs are located in brain areas that are difficult to access, creating a risk of side effects. Radiation is another treatment option, but it, too, can lead to serious adverse effects. We found that using focused ultrasound to open the blood-brain barrier can improve drug delivery to CCMs . Additionally, we also observed that focused ultrasound treatment itself could stop CCMs from growing in mice, even without administering a drug. While we don’t yet understand how focused ultrasound is stabilizing CCMs, abundant research on the safety of using this technique in patients treated for other conditions has allowed neurosurgeons to begin designing clinical trials testing the use of this technique on people with CCM. With further research and advancements, I am hopeful that focused ultrasound can become a viable treatment option for many devastating rare diseases.",https://theconversation.com/focused-sound-energy-holds-promise-for-treating-cancer-alzheimers-and-other-diseases-262622,Society,theconversation.com,Richard J.

9cdbd0fa4337,Our team of physicists inadvertently generated the shortestX-raypulses ever observed,"attosecond, lasers, new research, physics, steehm new research, x-rays","X-ray beams aren’t used just by doctors to see inside your body and tell whether you have a broken bone. More powerful beams made up of very short flashes of X-rays can help scientists peer into the structure of individual atoms and molecules and differentiate types of elements. But getting an X-ray laser beam that delivers super short flashes to capture the fastest processes in nature isn’t easy – it’s a whole science in itself. Radio waves, microwaves, the visible light you can see, ultraviolet light and X-rays are all exactly the same phenomenon: electromagnetic waves of energy moving through space. What differentiates them is their wavelength. Waves in the X-ray range have short wavelengths, while radio waves and microwaves are much longer. Different wavelengths of light are useful for different things – X-rays help doctors take snapshots of your body, while microwaves can heat up your lunch. The rainbow of visible light that you can see is only a small slice of all the kinds of light. While all light is the same phenomenon, it acts differently depending on how long its wavelength is and how high its frequency is. Inductiveload, NASA/Wikimedia Commons , CC BY-SA Optical lasers are devices that emit parallel, or collimated , beams of light. They send out a beam where all the waves have the same wavelength – the red light you get from a laser pointer is one example – and oscillate in synchronicity. Over the past 15 years, scientists have built X-ray free-electron lasers, which instead of emitting beams of visible light emit X-rays. They are housed in large facilities where electrons travel through a long accelerator – depending on the facility, between a few hundred meters and 1,700 yards – and after passing through a series of thousands of magnets they generate extremely short and powerful X-ray pulses. The Stanford linear accelerator, shown here from above, is a 1.9-mile-long X-ray free-electron laser. Peter Kaminski, using data from USGS , CC BY The pulses are used kind of like flash photography, where the flash – the X-ray pulse – is short enough to capture the fast movement of an object. Researchers have used them as cameras to study how atoms and molecules move and change inside materials or cells. But while these X-ray free-electron laser pulses are very short and powerful, they’re not the shortest pulses that scientists can make with lasers. By using more advanced technology and taking advantage of the properties some materials have, researchers can create even shorter pulses: in the attosecond region . One attosecond is one-billionth of a billionth of a second. An attosecond is to one second about what one second is to the 14 billion-year age of the universe. The fastest processes in atoms and molecules happen at the attosecond scale: For instance, it takes electrons attoseconds to move around inside a molecule. We’re physicists who work with X-ray free-electron lasers. We study what happens when we put different types of materials in the X-ray free-electron pulses’ path. In a new experiment we put copper and manganese samples in the path of highly focused X-ray free-electron laser pulses. We knew the interactions between these elements and the X-ray free-electron laser pulses would generate new X-ray laser pulses. Originally, we wanted to find out how different chemical forms of the element manganese – for example, manganese-II and manganese-VII – would create small changes in the wavelengths of these newly generated X-ray laser pulses. But along the way, we found some unexpected results that made the newly generated X-ray laser pulses act strangely. At first, we did not understand why, but when we eventually figured it out, we realized that we had discovered two unique laser phenomena, and that these effects had helped us generate X-ray laser pulses that where much shorter than we’d expected – shorter than the fastest X-ray pulses ever previously generated. The short pulses generated by the laser at SLAC allow researchers to study molecules at the atomic scale or see how different materials interact with X-ray light. Filamentation – irregular spurts We found that our new X-ray laser pulses weren’t always shooting out in the forward direction, as we expected. When we increased the intensity of the X-ray free-electron laser pulses, the resulting new X-ray laser pulses spurted out irregularly, in slightly different directions. For optical lasers, these irregular spurts – or filamentation – result from the index of refraction changing in the laser material. But we didn’t expect to see this effect for X-rays, since materials – including the manganese and copper we used – don’t refract X-rays very much. However, the high intensity X-ray free-electron laser pulses we used generated the fluctuations at the quantum level in our materials that led to these irregular spurts. Rabi cycling – a broad spectrum of light Even more surprising than the filamentation effects we saw was the fact that the X-ray pulses we generated contained a variety of different wavelengths that were more spread out than what we expected to see with the materials we used. Seventy years ago – five years before the first optical laser was built – physicists Stanley Autler and Charles Townes discovered a strange phenomenon in microwaves known as Rabi cycling. And the spread of wavelengths we saw looked just like Rabi cycling. Autler and Townes knew that when light hit an atom, the atom would absorb its energy by exciting an electron from one energy level to a higher one. The hole left by that missing electron is filled by an electron that’s coming down from a higher energy level in the atom and releasing – or emitting – this energy difference as light. What Autler and Townes found was that when the microwaves are very intense, the strong electric field can split each of these energy levels into two distinct levels, called doublets, which have slightly different energies. These doublets are separated by an energy, or a frequency, known as the Rabi frequency . The Rabi frequency depends on the intensity of the new light. The stronger it is, the larger is the energy separation. An X-ray laser shot spectrum exhibiting the three lines – called a Mollow triplet – that characterize Rabi cycling. The split energy is shown by the distance of the two smaller blobs from the stronger center blob. Uwe Bergmann and Thomas Linker In Autler and Townes’ discovery of Rabi cycling, they used microwaves. The energy splitting was so small that the Rabi frequency was very low, at radio wave frequencies. In this new study we used X-rays, which have 100 million times shorter wavelengths than microwaves and 100 million times more energy. This meant the resulting new X-ray laser pulses were split into different X-ray wavelengths corresponding to Rabi frequencies in the extreme ultraviolet region. Ultraviolet light has a frequency 100 million times higher than radio waves. This Rabi cycling effect allowed us to generate the shortest high-energy X-ray pulses to date, clocking in at 60-100 attoseconds. Future directions and applications While the pulses that X-ray free-electron lasers currently generate allow researchers to observe atomic bonds forming, rearranging and breaking, they are not fast enough to look inside the electron cloud that generates such bonds. Using these new attosecond X-ray laser pulses could allow scientists to study the fastest processes in materials at the atomic-length scale and to discern different elements. In the future, we also hope to use much shorter X-ray free-electron laser pulses to better generate these attosecond X-ray pulses. We are even hoping to generate pulses below 60 attoseconds by using heavier materials with shorter lifespans, such as tungsten or hafnium. These new X-ray pulses are fast enough to eventually enable scientists to answer questions such as how exactly an electron cloud moves around and what a chemical bond actually is.",https://theconversation.com/our-team-of-physicists-inadvertently-generated-the-shortest-x-ray-pulses-ever-observed-258776,Society,theconversation.com,Thomas Linker,https://images.theconversation.com/files/685657/original/file-20250814-61-f8ir9h.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&rect=0%2C105%2C2040%2C1020&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop,2025-10-15T12:48:14+00:00,4ac4f2efb26c806caba337fe83a4097b2fad2b3e
bfa3500a7ec9,Jean-JacquesDessalines: Reassessing the Haitian revolutionary leader’s legacy,"caribbean, empire, french revolution, haiti, haitian revolution, independence, napoleon, napoleonic wars, revolution, slave trade, slavery, toussaint louverture","Every Oct. 17, Haiti celebrates Dessalines Day , commemorating the assassination in 1806 of the country’s first head of state postindependence, Jean-Jacques Dessalines. One of the founding fathers in the struggle for Haitian independence, alongside Toussaint Louverture , Dessalines has a mixed legacy: celebrated at home for his role in ending slavery and overthrowing French colonial rule, but often condemned internationally for his violent tactics and the 1804 killing of white French people in independent Haiti. Historian Julia Gaffield ’s new book, “ I Have Avenged America: Jean-Jacques Dessalines and Haiti’s Fight for Freedom ,” provides a more nuanced view of Dessalines. The Conversation spoke with Gaffield about the challenges of presenting the Haitian leader to a modern readership. What drove you to write the book now? Although there have been biographies of Dessalines in Haiti and a heavily fictionalized one in France in 1804, until now there hasn’t been one published in the English language. And this silence forms part of a much longer process of demonizing Dessalines in the international sphere – he just doesn’t get the same attention that Toussaint Louverture gets in the narrative of the Haitian Revolution. What I found interesting was the Desssalines that emerged in my research didn’t match the Dessalines that was being presented in public. I was interested in his international diplomacy and state-making, but many accounts just highlighted the violence of the revolution and Dessalines’ very radical role. On one side, he is criticized for being uniquely violent – something that wasn’t even true in the context of the time. But characterizing him this way was an attempt to present him as “savage,” “barbaric” and in line with other racist tropes. On the other hand, he is celebrated by Haitians and others for his use of violence. He was seen as the man for the job – the job of ending more than a century of French colonial rule. A crude depiction of Jean Jacques Dessalines holding the severed head of a white colonist woman used to illustrate Louis Dubroca’s fictionalized biography. Manuel López López/Wikimedia Commons But in the book, I tell a more complicated story of Dessalines. Yes, he was a military leader who fought on the front lines, and success came from violent warfare. But he was a multilayered person; his state-building wasn’t just about violent revolution but also diplomacy and international relations and a deep commitment to abolitionism. Why has Dessalines been singled out for committing violence? A number of different things are at play here. At the time, the French people reporting on the ground and from abroad held Dessalines and other Haitian revolutionaries to a different standard. While the white French colonists perpetrated acts of extreme brutality and violence, when Haitian revolutionaries fought back, they were criticized for not following the standard rules of warfare. This was a double standard that all Haitian revolutionaries were held to – but Dessalines was singled out. The Haitian Revolution began in 1791, and the revolutionaries forced France to abolish slavery in 1793. After that time, Dessalines joined France to defend this hard-won freedom. And this is one of the parts of Dessalines’ life that doesn’t often get remembered or talked about – for much of the Haitian Revolution he was a French general, defending the abolition of slavery against attacks from other European empires. But when the French themselves started to undo abolition, Dessalines understood that freedom could be preserved only with independence. Dessalines’ reputation took on another layer in the war for independence and after. He ended up becoming an enemy of the French state, and criticism of Dessalines’ violence helped the French undermine the fight for Haitian independence, especially internationally. After he declared independence on Jan. 1, 1804 , Dessalines executed some of the French colonists who remained on the island. This was legitimized as a way to protect the country from further invasions – which the French were constantly threatening to do. It was also vengeance for the crimes committed by the French colonists during the colonial era and during the horrific expedition sent by Napoleon Bonaparte in 1802. The 1804 killings of French people did a lot to forge Dessalines’ image overseas. A lot of the narratives in the early months of 1804 were created from reports written by French and British people who were scared of Haitian independence and scared of the abolition of slavery. Actual evidence of what happened is limited. But certainly not every white person was killed as is often stated. British and American merchants were safe, Polish people in Haiti were welcomed into the new nation, and even the reports of the number of French people killed undermine each other. Some white French people were even given Haitian citizenship. But people at the time were not interested in making a nuanced argument or interested in understanding the Haitian perspective, and so they made sweeping claims about every last white person being “massacred.” These claims were part of a broader effort to demonize Haitians and ensure that independence failed. And in some ways the emphasis on Dessalines’ violence is odd. It overlooks the violence of slavery and the French colonial rule. The actions of the French in denying their defeat in Haiti were certainly much more significant to Haiti’s long-term future than anything Dessalines did or didn’t do. How has the view of Dessalines changed since his lifetime? In Haiti there have been ebbs and flows in how he has been remembered, especially in the 19th century. Part of this is because people there were living in a world in which Haitian sovereignty was not recognized by other counties. While it gained independence under Dessalines in 1804, the U.S. didn’t recognize it until 1862 . And there were moments when people tied Dessalines’ violent reputation to this foreign nonrecognition. But it was not the only reason that countries did not extend relations to Haiti. It wasn’t really until the 100th anniversary of independence, in 1904, when Dessalines finally got established in the pantheon of Haitian founding fathers. And it was from then that his memory was more firmly remembered as positive. The national anthem composed to celebrate the centenary is “ La Dessalinienne ,” named in his honor, for example. In Haitian politics today, he tends to stand in for national sovereignty and the rejection of external influence. That Haiti should exist with no outside meddling is his political reputation nowadays. Outside of Haiti, it is only much more recently that Dessalines’ actions have been seen in a more nuanced way. But even now there is no consensus over his reputation. There are remnants of his portrayals from more than 200 years ago. Tucker Carlson in 2018 referred to Dessalines as a “genocidal nutcase .” He was talking about the Haitian emperor in the context of a street in an area known as “Little Haiti” in Brooklyn, New York, being renamed in his honor. But the renaming of the street also plays into the rehabilitation of Dessalines. His image has also been used in a Beats by Dre commercial featuring the tennis player Naomi Osaka . It also was used in Steve McQueen’s “Small Axe ” films. Can you talk us through your choice of cover image? The first thing to note is that none of the images we have of Dessalines were done by anyone who ever saw him – so they just made it up. That started with the very racist depiction of him in a Spanish translation of the 1804 biography “La Vie de J-J Dessalines ” by Louis Dubroca, which included a person meant to be Dessalines holding a decapitated white woman’s head. That image circulated and stuck. Julia Gaffield/Yale Books Similar racist depictions were released, all meant to support an argument that Dessalines was born in Africa – which he wasn’t – and was very “African”-like, by which they meant “savage.” The painting I used for the cover is by Haitian artist Ulrick Jean-Pierre. It shows Dessalines standing boldly and confidently. I also like the fact that the feathers on the cap and trees behind him are swaying: He is standing boldly but in a stormy, unsettled and complicated era. Was researching the book tricky, given the bias of many sources? Most of the records on the Haitian revolution were written by people who opposed the revolutionaries. But there is not nothing from the other side – there are accounts of these events written by Haitians, and there are letters and declarations by Dessalines himself. These, in my opinion, haven’t been taken as seriously as they could have because so many people were trying to undermine Dessalines’ political project. Throughout the book I take Dessalines’ words seriously, and those of his fellow Haitian revolutionaries. One of the things I encountered when I started this research was a lot of people saying, “There’s not a lot of sources for that.” One strategy I employed was looking for sources everywhere and anywhere. You can find sources on the revolution in Haiti but also in the U.S., France, the Netherlands, England, the Vatican and in Jamaica – anyplace that had interactions with Haiti. What did you learn during the writing of the book? I got a better sense of how personal the Haitian Revolution was to Dessalines. I had initially studied Dessalines through the lens of international diplomacy. So I saw him as a head of state, rather than an individual. Through the research, I got a much better sense of the experiences that drove the man and his fight for freedom and against colonization – through his experiences with his extended family and his interactions with colleagues. At the cost of personal relations and personal safety, he fought for freedom – and that was the driving force behind everything for Dessalines: the fight to abolish slavery.",https://theconversation.com/jean-jacques-dessalines-reassessing-the-haitian-revolutionary-leaders-legacy-266326,Society,theconversation.com,Julia Gaffield,https://images.theconversation.com/files/696201/original/file-20251014-56-3umtim.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&rect=0%2C458%2C2488%2C1244&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop,2025-10-15T12:47:55+00:00,a85fe565ca507a6be89f7311255622a2107b7ef2
cd09a2ad1b4f,"Yes, ADHD diagnoses are rising, but that doesn’t mean it’s overdiagnosed","adhd, adhd diagnosis, adhd symptoms, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (adhd), disability, hyperactivity, impulsivity, inattention, overdiagnosis, stimulants","Many news outlets have reported an increase – or surge – in attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, or ADHD, diagnoses in both children and adults . At the same time, health care providers, teachers and school systems have reported an uptick in requests for ADHD assessments . These reports have led some experts and parents to wonder whether ADHD is being overdiagnosed and overtreated . As researchers who have spent our careers studying neurodevelopmental disorders like ADHD , we are concerned that fears about widespread overdiagnosis are misplaced, perhaps based on a fundamental misunderstanding of the condition. Understanding ADHD as one end of a spectrum Discussions about overdiagnosis of ADHD imply that you either have it or you don’t. However, when epidemiologists ask people in the general population about their symptoms of ADHD, some have a few symptoms, some have a moderate level, and a few have lots of symptoms. But there is no clear dividing line between those who are diagnosed with ADHD and those who are not, since ADHD – much like blood pressure – occurs on a spectrum . Treating mild ADHD is similar to treating mild high blood pressure – it depends on the situation. Care can be helpful when a doctor considers the details of a person’s daily life and how much the symptoms are affecting them. Not only can ADHD symptoms be very different from person to person, but research shows that ADHD symptoms can change within an individual . For example, symptoms become more severe when the challenges of life increase. ADHD symptoms fluctuate depending on many factors , including whether the person is at school or home, whether they have had enough sleep, if they are under a great deal of stress or if they are taking medications or other substances. Someone who has mild ADHD may not experience many symptoms while they are on vacation and well rested, for example, but they may have impairing symptoms if they have a demanding job or school schedule and have not gotten enough sleep. These people may need treatment for ADHD in certain situations but may do just fine without treatment in other situations. This is similar to what is seen in conditions like high blood pressure, which can change from day to day or from month to month, depending on a person’s diet, stress level and many other factors. Can ADHD symptoms change over time? ADHD symptoms start in early childhood and typically are at their worst in mid-to late childhood . Thus, the average age of diagnosis is between 9 and 12 years old. This age is also the time when children are transitioning from elementary school to middle school and may also be experiencing changes in their environment that make their symptoms worse. Classes can be more challenging beginning around fifth grade than in earlier grades. In addition, the transition to middle school typically means that children move from having all their subjects taught by one teacher in a single classroom to having to change classrooms with a different teacher for each class. These changes can exacerbate symptoms that were previously well-controlled. Symptoms can also wax and wane throughout life. For most people, symptoms improve – but may not completely disappear – after age 25 , which is also the time when the brain has typically finished developing. Psychiatric problems that often co-occur with ADHD, such as anxiety or depression, can worsen ADHD symptoms that are already present . These conditions can also mimic ADHD symptoms, making it difficult to know which to treat. High levels of stress leading to poorer sleep, and increased demands at work or school, can also exacerbate or cause ADHD-like symptoms . Finally, the use of some substances, such as marijuana or sedatives, can worsen, or even cause, ADHD symptoms . In addition to making symptoms worse in someone who already has an ADHD diagnosis, these factors can also push someone who has mild symptoms into full-blown ADHD, at least for a short time. The reverse is also true: Symptoms of ADHD can be minimized or reversed in people who do not meet full diagnostic criteria once the external cause is removed. Kids with ADHD often have overlapping symptoms with anxiety, depression, dyslexia and more. How prevalence is determined Clinicians diagnose ADHD based on symptoms of inattention, hyperactivity and impulsivity. To make an ADHD diagnosis in children, six or more symptoms in at least one of these three categories must be present. For adults, five or more symptoms are required, but they must begin in childhood. For all ages, the symptoms must cause serious problems in at least two areas of life, such as home, school or work. Current estimates show that the strict prevalence of ADHD is about 5% in children. In young adults, the figure drops to 3%, and it is less than 1% after age 60 . Researchers use the term “strict prevalence” to mean the percentage of people who meet all of the criteria for ADHD based on epidemiological studies. It is an important number because it provides clinicians and scientists with an estimate on how many people are expected to have ADHD in a given group of people. In contrast, the “diagnosed prevalence” is the percentage of people who have been diagnosed with ADHD based on real-world assessments by health care professionals. The diagnosed prevalence in the U.S. and Canada ranges from 7.5% to 11.1% in children under age 18. These rates are quite a bit higher than the strict prevalence of 5%. Some researchers claim that the difference between the diagnosed prevalence and the strict prevalence means that ADHD is overdiagnosed . We disagree. In clinical practice, the diagnostic rules allow a patient to be diagnosed with ADHD if they have most of the symptoms that cause distress, impairment or both, even when they don’t meet the full criteria. And much evidence shows that increases in the diagnostic prevalence can be attributed to diagnosing milder cases that may have been missed previously. The validity of these mild diagnoses is well-documented . Consider children who have five inattentive symptoms and five hyperactive-impulsive symptoms. These children would not meet strict diagnostic criteria for ADHD even though they clearly have a lot of ADHD symptoms. But in clinical practice, these children would be diagnosed with ADHD if they had marked distress, disability or both because of their symptoms – in other words, if the symptoms were interfering substantially with their everyday lives. So it makes sense that the diagnosed prevalence of ADHD is substantially higher than the strict prevalence. A robust body of literature shows the negative outcomes associated with underdiagnosis and undertreatment of ADHD. SolStock/E+ via Getty Images Implications for patients, parents and clinicians People who are concerned about overdiagnosis commonly worry that people are taking medications they don’t need or that they are diverting resources away from those who need it more. Other concerns are that people may experience side effects from the medications, or that they may be stigmatized by a diagnosis. Those concerns are important. However, there is strong evidence that underdiagnosis and undertreatment of ADHD lead to serious negative outcomes in school, work, mental health and quality of life. In other words, the risks of not treating ADHD are well-established. In contrast, the potential harms of overdiagnosis remain largely unproven . It is important to consider how to manage the growing number of milder cases, however. Research suggests that children and adults with less severe ADHD symptoms may benefit less from medication than those with more severe symptoms . This raises an important question: How much benefit is enough to justify treatment? These are decisions best made in conversations between clinicians, patients and caregivers. Because ADHD symptoms can shift with age, stress, environment and other life circumstances, treatment needs to be flexible. For some, simple adjustments like classroom seating changes, better sleep or reduced stress may be enough. For others, medication, behavior therapy or a combination of these interventions may be necessary. The key is a personalized approach that adapts as patients’ needs evolve over time.",https://theconversation.com/yes-adhd-diagnoses-are-rising-but-that-doesnt-mean-its-overdiagnosed-257108,Society,theconversation.com,Carol Mathews,https://images.theconversation.com/files/695988/original/file-20251013-56-5nvnou.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&rect=0%2C1301%2C7793%2C3896&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop,2025-10-15T12:47:36+00:00,755d815f94991267032f8b1ed56e28ce174e02f6
7ee9b6fa7e30,Flamingos are making a home in Florida again after 100 years – an ecologist explains why they may be returning for good,"estuaries, everglades, flamingos, florida, ornithology, south florida","Hurricane Idalia blew a flamboyance, or flock, of 300-400 flamingos that was likely migrating between the Yucatan Peninsula and Cuba off course in August 2023 and unceremoniously deposited the birds across a wide swath of the eastern United States, from Florida’s Gulf Coast all the way up to Wisconsin and east to Pennsylvania. After Hurricane Idalia, more than 300 credible sightings of flamingos across the eastern U.S. were reported. Audubon Florida I’m an estuarine scientist . That means I study ecosystems where fresh water flows into the ocean . I’ve spent 35 years with Audubon Florida studying the ecology of American flamingos and other wading birds in Florida Bay, Everglades National Park . So naturally, I was thrilled and intrigued by the sudden arrival of these flamingos. One of the birds was rescued in the Tampa area after nearly drowning in the Gulf of Mexico. His rescuers named him Peaches. A colleague and I were able to place a GPS tracking device and a bright blue band around his spindly leg, with the code “US02” engraved in white letters. Melissa Edwards, Avian Hospital Director at Seaside Seabird Sanctuary, holds Peaches still while Dr. Frank Ridgley of Zoo Miami and the author, Dr. Jerome Lorenz, place a band and GPS tracker on his leg. Dr. Lorenz has banded or supervised the banding of nearly 3,000 roseate spoonbills, but Peaches was his first and only flamingo to date. Linda Lorenz We were hoping to track his movements and see whether he ended up settling in Florida. Unfortunately, a few days after Peaches was released back into the wilds of Tampa Bay , the tracking device failed. His last reported sighting was on a beach near Marco Island on Oct. 5, 2023. Then, in June 2025, I received an email from colleagues at the Rio Lagartos Biosphere Reserve in Yucatan, Mexico, who had photographed Peaches, blue band still in place , nesting in the reserve. Peaches’ story is the latest piece in the historical puzzle of flamingos in Florida. Though the native population disappeared more than 100 years ago, recent events lead me to believe that flamingos may be coming back to the Sunshine State, and that their return has been facilitated by the concerted effort to restore the Everglades and coastal ecosystems. Decimation of a population In 1956, ornithologist and founder of the National Audubon’s Everglades Science Center Robert Porter Allen wrote “ The Flamingos: Their Life History and Survival ,” which is still considered a seminal document on the history of flamingos in Florida. In his book, Allen cites several historical and scientific manuscripts from the 1800s that indicate flamboyances of hundreds to thousands were seen in the Everglades, Florida Bay and the Florida Keys. Allen documents the demise of flamingos in the late 1800s, in Florida and throughout their Caribbean and Bahamian range. Like all wading birds in Florida, they fell victim to the women’s fashion trend of adorning hats with bird feathers . Wading bird feathers were literally worth their weight in gold. Led by the National Association of Audubon Societies’ vocal opposition, the grassroots environmental movement that followed brought about laws prohibiting the hunting and sale of bird feathers. But enforcement of those laws in sparsely populated Florida was difficult, and on two occasions deputized Audubon wardens were murdered protecting wading bird nesting colonies. Fortunately, within a few years, societal pressure turned the tide against the practice of wearing feathers. The passage of the Migratory Bird Treaty Act in 1918 officially ended the feather trade. Given legal protection, most species managed to reestablish huge nesting populations in the Everglades by the 1930s-1940s, presumably migrating from remote populations in Central America and the Caribbean. Flamingos, however, did not. A long road to recovery In 1956, 40 years after hunting had ended, Allen estimated flamingo populations were only about 25% of what they had been in the previous century, with numbers plummeting from 168,000 to 43,000 breeding adults. They nested in significant numbers at only four locations, compared to 29 historically. Flamingos’ unique breeding behaviors and their longevity – they can live up to 50 years in the wild – may account for their struggle to bounce back. Other Florida wading birds can nest multiple times a year at different locations, laying three to five eggs at a time. Flamingos, on the other hand, nest only once a year, generally returning to the same location year after year, and lay only one egg. Furthermore, they prefer forming huge nesting colonies, with thousands of nests, in part due to their elaborate group courtship rituals. Reason to hope As a result of their rarity from the 1950s to 1980s, scientists – including myself – believed that any flamingos sighted intermittently around Florida were not wild birds but rather escapees from captive populations. The largest flock observed in the state between 1930 and 1976 was 14 birds spotted in Biscayne Bay in 1934, on the day after Hialeah Race Track in Miami imported a group of about 30 flamingos . The track’s owners had failed to pinion the birds, and they simply flew away upon release. But my opinion began to change in 2002, when a flamingo that was banded as a chick at Rio Lagartos was photographed in Florida Bay. In 2012, a second bird from Rio Lagartos was photographed. By that time, I had observed flamingos in Florida Bay on several occasions, including larger flamboyances of 24 and 64 individuals. Although I still thought the majority of these flocks were escapees, the banded birds provided some evidence that at least a few wild flamingos were starting to spend time in Florida. Then in 2015, my colleagues put a tracking device on a flamingo they had captured at the Key West Naval Air Station. Conchy, as we called him, was given the blue band US01 and released in Florida Bay in December 2015. He lived in Florida Bay for two years , and the fact that he stayed for that long was proof to me that it was possible for flamingos to make a more permanent home in Florida . Conchy was banded and given a GPS tracker by Dr. Frank Ridgley of Zoo Miami before being re-released into Florida Bay in 2015. In 2018, several colleagues and I published a paper laying out both evidence from historical accounts and also previously overlooked evidence from museums that flamingos were native to Florida . We also presented new data from researchers and citizen science portals that strongly indicated that wild flamingo numbers were increasing in Florida. This suggested that the population might be finally recovering. Call it a comeback Fast-forward to today, and it appears that this slow comeback may finally have legs. Six months after Hurricane Idalia, my colleagues at Audubon Florida and I conducted a weeklong online survey of flamingo sightings in Florida. We received more than 50 reputable observations. After sorting through these observations to remove duplicates, we concluded that at least 100 flamingos were left in the state . Then in July 2025, a flock of 125 individuals was photographed in Florida Bay. Based on our observations, my colleagues and I believe that the flamingos that arrived with Idalia may be reestablishing a home in Florida. Progress toward restoration The question is, why now? The 24 flamingos I saw in 1992 and the 64 I saw in 2004 didn’t take up permanent residence in the state. So what’s changed? To me, the answer is clear: Efforts to restore the Everglades and Florida’s coastal ecosystems are beginning to show progress. When I arrived in the Keys in 1989, Florida Bay was undergoing an ecological collapse . A 1993 interagency report by the federal government found that a hundred years of draining, diking and rerouting the flows of the Everglades to create urban and agricultural lands had raised the salt content of the water, making it uninhabitable for many estuarine animals . The report noted that the bay’s famous seagrass beds were undergoing a massive die-off, accompanied by algal blooms that depleted oxygen levels, thereby killing fish in large numbers. Mangrove trees were dying on its myriad islands, and birds that for decades had nested in them had disappeared. These events kick-started Everglades restoration efforts, and in 2000 the U.S. Congress passed the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan with nearly unanimous bipartisan support. With a cost in the tens of billions of dollars, it was to be the largest and most expensive ecological restoration project the world has ever seen. Today, the bay’s health is vastly improved from the condition I observe in the 1980s. Water flow has gotten better, and the salinity is back to appropriate levels to support wildlife. In 2018 and 2021, more than 100,000 pairs of wading birds such as white ibis , wood storks and roseate spoonbills nested in the Everglades. These numbers hadn’t been seen since the 1940s. In the 1980s and 1990s, 20,000 nesting pairs was thought to be a banner year . While the Everglades and Florida Bay are still a long way from full restoration, I believe that the return of flamingos such as Conchy and Peaches is evidence that these efforts are on the right track.",https://theconversation.com/flamingos-are-making-a-home-in-florida-again-after-100-years-an-ecologist-explains-why-they-may-be-returning-for-good-258658,Society,theconversation.com,Jerome Lorenz,https://images.theconversation.com/files/694999/original/file-20251008-56-95462l.jpeg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&rect=0%2C625%2C6364%2C3182&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop,2025-10-14T19:20:23+00:00,2f19211c3e499ebb16e40023e9994f230914152a
dfc784fdd7d5,Typhoon leaves flooded Alaska villages facing a storm recovery far tougher than most Americans will ever experience,"alaska, extreme storms, extreme weather, flooding, floods, forecasting, indigenous, recovery, storm surge, storms, typhoon","Remnants of a powerful typhoon swept into Western Alaska’s Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta on Oct. 12, 2025, producing a storm surge that flooded villages as far as 60 miles up the river. The water pushed homes off their foundations and set some afloat with people inside , officials said. More than 50 people had to be rescued in Kipnuk and Kwigillingok, hundreds were displaced in the region, and at least one person died . Typhoon Halong was an unusual storm, likely fueled by the Pacific’s near-record warm surface temperatures this fall. Its timing means recovery will be even more difficult than usual for these hard-hit communities, as Alaska meteorologist Rick Thoman of the University Alaska Fairbanks explains. Disasters in remote Alaska are not like disasters anywhere in the lower 48 states, he explains. While East Coast homeowners recovering from a nor’easter that flooded parts of New Jersey and other states the same weekend can run to Home Depot for supplies or drive to a hotel if their home floods, none of that exists in remote Native villages. Ex-Typhoon Halong’s storm surge and powerful winds knocked homes off their foundations and set some afloat. U.S. Coast Guard via AP What made this storm unusual? Halong was an ex-typhoon, similar to Merbok in 2022 , by the time it reached the delta. A week earlier, it had been a powerful typhoon east of Japan. The jet stream picked it up and carried it to the northeast, which is pretty common, and weather models did a pretty good job in forecasting its track into the Bering Sea. But as the storm approached Alaska, everything went sideways. The weather model forecasts changed, reflecting a faster-moving storm, and Halong shifted to a very unusual track, moving between Saint Lawrence Island and the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta coast. Ex-Typhoon Halong’s storm track showing its turn toward Alaska’s Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta. Rick Thoman Unlike Merbok, which was very well forecast by the global models, this one’s final track and intensity weren’t clear until the storm was within 36 hours of crossing into Alaska waters. That’s too late for evacuations in many places. Did the loss of weather balloon data canceled in 2025 affect the forecast? That’s a question for future research, but here’s what we know for sure: There have not been any upper-air weather balloon observations at Saint Paul Island in the Bering Sea since late August or at Kotzebue since February. Bethel and Cold Bay are limited to one per day instead of two. At Nome, there were no weather balloons for two full days as the storm was moving toward the Bering Sea. Did any of this cause the forecast to be off? We don’t know because we don’t have the data, but it seems likely that that had some effect on the model performance. Why is the delta region so vulnerable in a storm like Halong? The land in this part of western Alaska is very flat, so major storms can drive the ocean into the delta, and the water spreads out. Most of the land there is very close to sea level, in some places less than 10 feet above the high tide line. Permafrost is also thawing , land is subsiding, and sea-level rise is adding to the risk. For many people, there is literally nowhere to go. Even Bethel , the region’s largest town, about 60 miles up the Kuskokwim River, saw flooding from Halong. These are very remote communities with no roads to cities. The only way to access them is by boat or plane. Right now, they have a lot of people with nowhere to live , and winter is closing in. Native residents of Kipnuk discuss the challenges of permafrost loss and climate change in their village. Alaska Institute for Justice. These villages are also small. They don’t have extra housing or the resources to rapidly recover. The region was already recovering from major flooding in summer 2024 . Kipnuk’s tribe was able to get federal disaster aid , but that aid was approved only in early January 2025. What are these communities facing in terms of recovery? People are going to have really difficult decisions to make. Do they leave the community for the winter and hope to rebuild next summer? There likely isn’t much available housing in the region, with the flooding so widespread on top of a housing shortage. Do displaced people go to Anchorage? Cities are expensive. There is no easy answer. It’s logistically complicated to rebuild in places like Kipnuk. You can’t just get on the phone and call up your local building contractor. Almost all of the supplies have to come in by barge – plywood to nails to windows – and that isn’t going to happen in winter. You can’t truck it in – there are no roads. Planes can only fly in small amounts – the runways are short and not built for cargo planes. The National Guard might be able to help fly in supplies. But then you still need to have people who can do the construction and other repair work. Everything is 100 times more complicated when it comes to building in remote communities. Even if national or state help is approved, it would be next summer before most homes could be rebuilt. Is climate change playing a role in storms like these? That will be another question for future research, but sea-surface temperature in most of the North Pacific that Typhoon Halong passed over before reaching the Aleutian Islands has been much warmer than normal . Warm water fuels storms. A comparison of daily sea-surface temperatures shows how anomalously warm much of the northern Pacific Ocean was ahead of and during Typhoon Halong. NOAA Coral Reef Watch Halong also brought lots of very warm air northward with it.

7ebcf07cc10f,The limits of free speech protections in American broadcasting,"abc, cbs, censorship, charlie kirk, communication, democrats, fcc, first amendment, franklin delano roosevelt, free speech, jfk, jimmy kimmel, media, nbc, republicans, super bowl, us supreme court, us media, white house","The chairman of the Federal Communications Commission is displeased with a broadcast network. He makes his displeasure clear in public speeches, interviews and congressional testimony. The network, afraid of the regulatory agency’s power to license their owned-and-operated stations, responds quickly. They change the content of their broadcasts. Network executives understand the FCC’s criticism is supported by the White House, and the chairman implicitly represents the president. I’m not just referring to the recent controversy between FCC Chairman Brendan Carr, ABC and Jimmy Kimmel . The same chain of events has happened repeatedly in U.S. history. President Franklin Delano Roosevelt’s FCC chairman, James Lawrence Fly, warned the networks about censoring news commentators . Then there was John F. Kennedy’s FCC chairman, Newton Minow , who criticized the networks for not airing more news and public affairs programming to support American democracy during the Cold War. And there was George W. Bush’s FCC chairman, Michael Powell. He decided that a fleeting “ wardrobe malfunction ” during the 2004 Super Bowl halftime show – when Janet Jackson’s breast was exposed – was sufficient to punish CBS with a fine. In each of those cases, the FCC represented the views of the White House. And in each case, the regulatory agency was employed to pressure the networks into airing content more aligned with the administration’s ideology. But what’s interesting in those four examples is that two of the FCC chairmen were Democrats – Fly and Minow – and two were Republicans – Powell and Carr. As a media historian , I’m aware of the long-existing bipartisan enthusiasm for exploiting the fact that no First Amendment exists in American broadcasting. Pressuring broadcasters by leveraging FCC power occurs regardless of which party controls the White House. And when the agency is used in partisan fashion, the rival party will criticize such politicization of regulation as a threat to free speech. This recurring cycle is made possible by the fact that broadcasting is licensed by the government. Since a Supreme Court decision in 1943 , the supremacy of the FCC in broadcast regulation has been unquestioned. Such strong governmental oversight separates broadcasting from any other medium of mass communication in the United States. And it’s the reason why there’s no “free speech” when it comes to Kimmel, or any other performer, on U.S. airwaves. The FCC’s empowerment Since its establishment in 1934, the FCC’s primary role in broadcasting has been to authorize local station licenses “ in the public interest, convenience, or necessity .” In 1938, the FCC began its first investigation into network practices and policies, which resulted in new regulations. One of the new rules stated that no network could own and operate more than one licensed station in any single market. This forced NBC, which owned two networks that operated stations in several markets, to divest itself of one of its networks. NBC sued. In the first serious constitutional test of the FCC’s full authority, in 1943, the Supreme Court vindicated the FCC’s expansive power over all U.S. broadcasting in its 5–4 verdict in National Broadcasting Co. v. United States . The ruling has stood since. That’s why there’s no First Amendment in broadcasting. The Supreme Court ruled that, due to spectrum scarcity – the idea that the airwaves are a limited public resource and therefore not every American can operate a broadcast station – the FCC’s power over broadcasting must be expansive. The 1934 act, the 1943 Supreme Court decision read , “gave the Commission … expansive powers … and a comprehensive mandate to ‘encourage the larger and more effective use of radio in the public interest,’ if need be, by making ‘special regulations applicable to radio stations engaged in chain (network) broadcasting.’” The ruling also explains why the FCC can be credited with having created the American Broadcasting Company . Yes, the same ABC that suspended Kimmel in the face of FCC threats was the network that emerged from NBC’s forced divestiture of its Blue Network as a result of the 1943 Supreme Court decision. The empowerment of the FCC by NBC v. U.S. led to such content restrictions as the Fairness Doctrine , which intended to ensure balanced political broadcasting, instituted in 1949, and later, additional FCC rules against obscenity and indecency on the airwaves. The Supreme Court decision also encouraged FCC chairmen to flex their regulatory muscles in public more often. A federal appeals court ruled on Nov. 2, 2011, that CBS should not be fined US$550,000 for Janet Jackson’s infamous ‘wardrobe malfunction.’ AP Photo/David Phillip For example, when CBS suspended news commentator Cecil Brown in 1943 for truthful but critical news commentary about the U.S. World War II effort, FCC Chairman Fly expressed his displeasure with the network’s decision. “It is a little strange,” Fly told the press , “that all Americans are to enjoy free speech except radio commentators.” When FCC Chairman Minow complained about television in the U.S. devolving into a “ vast wasteland ” in 1961, the networks responded both defensively and productively. They invested far more money into news and public affairs programming. That led to significantly more news reporting and documentary production throughout the 1960s and 1970s. A ‘hands-off’ FCC In the early 2000s, FCC Chairman Powell promised to “refashion the FCC into an outfit that is fast, decisive and, above all, hands-off.” Yet his promise to be “hands-off” did not apply to content regulation. In 2004, his FCC concluded a contentious legal battle with Clear Channel Communications over comments ruled “indecent” by shock jock Howard Stern. The settlement resulted in a US$1.75 million payment by Clear Channel Communications – the largest fine ever collected by the FCC for speech on the airwaves. Powell apparently enjoyed policing content, as evidenced by the $550,000 fine his FCC levied against CBS for the fleeting exposure of singer Janet Jackson’s breast during the Super Bowl. The fine was eventually overturned . But Powell did successfully lobby Congress to significantly hike the amount of money the FCC could fine broadcasters for indecency . The fine for a single incident increased from $32,000 to $325,000, and up to $3 million if a network broadcasts it on multiple stations. Powell’s regulatory activism, done mostly to curb the outrageous antics of radio shock jocks, resulted in some of the most significant and long-lasting restrictions on broadcast freedom in U.S. history .  Thus, Carr’s 2025 threats toward ABC can be viewed in a historical context as an extension of established FCC activism. Demonstrators hold signs on Sept. 18, 2025, outside Los Angeles’ El Capitan Entertainment Centre, where the late-night show ‘Jimmy Kimmel Live!’ is staged. AP Photo/Damian Dovarganes But Carr’s threat also appeared to contradict his previously espoused values. As the author of the FCC section in Project 2025 , a conservative blueprint for federal government policies, Carr wrote: “The FCC should promote freedom of speech … and pro-growth reforms that support a diversity of viewpoints.” In exploiting the FCC’s licensing power to threaten to penalize speech he found offensive, Carr failed to promote either freedom of speech or diversity of viewpoints. If there’s one thing the Carr-Kimmel episode teaches us, it’s that more Americans should know the structural constraints in the U.S. system of broadcasting. Media literacy has proved essential as curbs to free expression – both official and unofficial – have become more popular. When the FCC threatens a broadcaster, it does so in Americans’ name. If Americans applaud regulatory activism when it supports their partisan beliefs, consistency demands they accept the same regulatory activism in the hands of their political opponents. If Americans prefer their political opposition show restraint in the regulation of broadcasting, then they need to promote restraint when their preferred administration is in power.",https://theconversation.com/the-limits-of-free-speech-protections-in-american-broadcasting-266206,Society,theconversation.com,Michael J.

88a01980a5c4,What the First Amendment doesn’t protect when it comes to professors speaking out on politics,"academic freedom, academic work, charlie kirk, first amendment, freedom of speech, higher education, political polarization, public universities, u.s. polarization, us supreme court, us higher education, freedom of speech on campus","American colleges and universities are increasingly firing or punishing professors and other employees for what they say , whether it’s on social media or in the classroom. After the Sept. 10, 2025, killing of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, several universities, including Iowa State University , Clemson University , Ball State University and others, fired or suspended employees for making negative online comments about Kirk . Some of these dismissed professors compared Kirk to a Nazi, described his views as hateful, or said there was no reason to be sorry about his death . Some professors are now suing their employers for taking disciplinary action against them, claiming they are violating their First Amendment rights . In one case, the University of South Dakota fired Phillip Michael Cook, a tenured art professor , after he posted on Facebook in September that Kirk was a “hate spreading Nazi.” Cook, who took down his post within a few hours and apologized for it, then sued the school, saying it was violating his First Amendment rights. A federal judge stated in a Sept. 23 preliminary order that the First Amendment likely protected what Cook posted . The judge ordered the University of South Dakota to reinstate Cook, and the university announced on Oct. 4 that it would reverse Cook’s firing. Cook’s lawsuit, as well as other lawsuits filed by dismissed professors , is testing how much legal authority colleges have over their employees’ speech – both when they are on the job and when they are not. For decades, American colleges and universities have traditionally encouraged free speech and open debate as a core part of their academic mission. As scholars who study college free speech and academic freedom, we recognize that these events raise an important question: When, if ever, can a college legally discipline an employee for what they say? An aerial view of University of South Dakota’s Vermillion campus, one of the places where a professor was recently fired for posting comments about Charlie Kirk, a decision that was later reversed. anup khanal - CC BY-SA 4.0 Limits of public employees’ speech rights The First Amendment limits the government’s power to censor people’s free speech. People in the United States can, for instance, join protests, criticize the government and say things that others find offensive. But the First Amendment only applies to the government – which includes public colleges and universities – and not private institutions or companies, including private colleges and universities. This means private colleges typically have wide authority to discipline employees for their speech . In contrast, public colleges are considered part of the government. The First Amendment limits the legal authority they have over their employees’ speech. This is especially true when an employee is speaking as a private citizen – such as participating in a political rally outside of work hours, for example. The Supreme Court ruled in a landmark 1968 case that public employees’ speech rights as private citizens can extend to criticizing their employer, like if they write a letter critical of their employer to a newspaper . The Supreme Court also ruled in 2006 that 
the First Amendment does not protect public employees from being disciplined by their employers when they say or write something as part of their official job duties. Even when a public college employee is speaking outside of their job duties as a private citizen, they might not be guaranteed First Amendment protection. To reach this legal threshold, what they say must be about something of importance to the public, or what courts call a “matter of public concern .” Talking or writing about news, politics or social matters – Kirk’s murder – often meets the legal test for when speech is about a matter of public concern. In contrast, courts have ruled that personal workplace complaints or gossip typically does not guarantee freedom of speech protection. And in some cases, even when a public employee speaks as a private citizen on a topic that a court considers a matter of public concern, their speech may still be unprotected. A public employer can still convince a court that its reasons for prohibiting an employee’s speech – like preventing conflict among co-workers – are important enough to deny this employee First Amendment protection . Lawsuits brought by the employees of public colleges and universities who have been fired for their comments about Kirk may likely be decided based on whether what they said or wrote amounts to a matter of public concern. Another important factor is whether a court is convinced that an employee’s speech about Kirk was serious enough to disrupt a college’s operations, thus justifying the employee’s firing. Academic freedom and professors’ speech There are also questions over whether professors at public universities, in particular, can cite other legal rights to protect their speech. Academic freedom refers to a faculty member’s rights connected to their teaching and research expertise . At both private and public colleges, professors’ work contracts – like the ones typically signed after receiving tenure – potentially provide legal protections for faculty speech connected to academic freedom, such as in the classroom. However, the First Amendment does not apply to how a private college regulates its professors’ speech or academic freedom. Professors at public colleges have at least the same First Amendment free speech rights as their fellow employees, like when speaking in a private citizen capacity. Additionally, the First Amendment might protect a public college professor’s work-related speech when academic freedom concerns arise, like in their teaching and research. In 2006, the Supreme Court left open the question of whether the First Amendment covers academic freedom, in a case where it found the First Amendment did not cover what public employees say when carrying out their official work . Since then, the Supreme Court has not dealt with this complicated issue. And lower federal courts have reached conflicting decisions about First Amendment protection for public college professors’ speech in their teaching and research. The First Amendment is on display in front of Independence Hall in Philadelphia. StephanieCraig/iStock via Getty Images Plus Future of free speech for university employees Some colleges, especially public ones, are testing the legal limits of their authority over their employees’ speech. These incidents demonstrate a culture of extreme political polarization in higher education. Beyond legal questions, colleges are also grappling with how to define their commitments to free speech and academic freedom. In particular, we believe campus leaders should consider the purpose of higher education. Even if legally permitted, restricting employees’ speech could run counter to colleges’ traditional role as places for the open exchange of ideas.",https://theconversation.com/what-the-first-amendment-doesnt-protect-when-it-comes-to-professors-speaking-out-on-politics-266128,Society,theconversation.com,Jeffrey C.

4da36405987c,"New student loan limits could change who gets to become a professor, doctor or lawyer","dentistry, education, equality, federal student loans, finance, gender, graduate school, higher education, inequality, law, medicine, race, student loans, universities","As millions of student loan borrowers settle into the school year, many are stressed about how they’ll pay for their degrees. These students may find that the One Big Beautiful Bill Act , the big tax and spending bill that President Donald Trump signed into law over the summer, could limit how much they can borrow. Until recently, graduate students could take out two types of federal loans: Direct Unsubsidized Loans , which had a lifetime limit of US$138,500, and Grad PLUS loans , which allowed students to borrow up to the full cost of attendance, minus financial aid. But Grad PLUS loans will be eliminated next summer, with a three-year transitional period for current borrowers. That will leave only the capped loans for new borrowers, and those loans have new lifetime borrowing limits: $200,000 for students pursuing certain professional degrees , and $100,000 for nonprofessional graduate programs. If you add both undergraduate and graduate loans, there’s a new lifetime limit of $257,500 per person. That seems modest to me. Consider that the annual average costs for an undergraduate degree range from $24,920 for in-state public universities to $58,000 for private universities . That means we’re looking at up to $224,000 for a bachelor’s degree. If we add three years of law school, we’re looking at an additional $132,000 to $168,000 , respectively. Alternatively, completing four years of medical school will set you back another $268,000 to $363,000. It’s not easy to make those numbers add up to less than $257,500. As I reflect on these numbers and my journey to becoming a college professor , specializing in race and ethnic studies, one thing becomes clear: I would never have been able to earn my bachelor’s degree, two master’s degrees, and Ph.D. under these new rules. Adjusting for inflation, I took out nearly $300,000 in student loans, and I paid them all off within a decade of starting my college teaching career. For me, the system worked. I wonder how today’s aspiring professionals, especially those from less prosperous backgrounds, will manage. The future of professionals Professional students already graduate with a lot of debt – often far more than the new loan caps will allow. In 2020, more than a quarter of graduating medical students and nearly 60% of graduating dental students had borrowed more than the new limits would allow , author Mark Kantrowitz, who is an expert on student loans , has found. In 2024, nearly a quarter of medical school graduates left school with more than $300,000 in debt. The new borrowing limits will likely hit minority students especially hard. While about 61% of all graduate students take out student loans , the share is much higher for Black students compared with white students, 48% to 17%. While some might be able to supplement their federal loans with private ones – which tend to have much worse terms for borrowers – I fear that many others will be forced to end their educations prematurely. That, in turn, would worsen the already severe shortage of doctors serving the Black community . As pointed out in a 2023 report of the Journal of the American Medical Association , the shortage of Black primary care physicians is directly related to overall lower population health and ultimately higher mortality rates within the Black community. As of 2023, fewer than 6% of U.S. doctors were Black, versus 14.4% of the population . Research has suggested that student loan relief would help diversify the medical workforce . Adding new restrictions would likely have the opposite effect, making the profession more homogeneous and significantly undermining Black public health . Or consider attorneys. Law school costs have risen more than 600% over the past two decades. The average 2020 law school graduate left with $165,000 in student debt . Black law students face unique challenges, graduating with approximately 8% more debt on average than white students and facing significant wage disparities once they enter the legal workforce. Making it harder for Black students to afford law school could reduce the number of Black attorneys , which has held steady at about 5% of active lawyers over the past 10 years. Reducing access to federal student loans risks disproportionately affecting women, since they hold roughly two-thirds of all student debt . What comes next Supporters of the change say that capping graduate student borrowing will encourage universities to rein in tuition hikes . They also say private student loan providers will step in to help students. I am skeptical, but the true test will come next year. In the meantime, professional students might want to familiarize themselves with the many scholarship opportunities available. Many organizations offer a range of medical school scholarships , including those targeting women and minorities . The same is true for students interested in law school. A helpful starting point is this list of scholarships with approaching deadlines and these opportunities for women and people of color .",https://theconversation.com/new-student-loan-limits-could-change-who-gets-to-become-a-professor-doctor-or-lawyer-262008,Society,theconversation.com,Rodney Coates,https://images.theconversation.com/files/693961/original/file-20251001-56-amo2r6.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&rect=0%2C11%2C8000%2C4000&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop,2025-10-14T12:37:48+00:00,05cbdc0b667fb2fe3f271567ef48e143d0f57869
e6ab25c4e441,In defense of ‘surveillance pricing’: Why personalized prices could be an unexpected force for equity,"consumers, data, economic policy, economics, economy, prices, pricing, redistribution, retail, surveillance, taxation","Surveillance pricing has dominated headlines recently. Delta Air Lines’ announcement that it will use artificial intelligence to set individualized ticket prices has led to widespread concerns about companies using personal data to charge different prices for identical products. As The New York Times reported, this practice involves companies tracking everything from your hotel bookings to your browsing history to determine what you’re willing to pay. The reaction has been swift. Democratic lawmakers have responded with outrage, with Texas Rep. Greg Casar introducing legislation to ban the practice . Meanwhile, President Donald Trump’s new chair of the Federal Trade Commission has shut down public comment on the issue , signaling that the regulatory pendulum may swing away from oversight entirely. What’s missing in this political back-and-forth is a deeper look at the economics. As a business school professor who researches pricing strategy, I think the debate misses important nuances. Opponents of surveillance pricing overlook some potential benefits that could make markets both more efficient and, counterintuitively, more equitable. What surveillance pricing actually is Surveillance pricing differs from traditional dynamic pricing , where prices rise for everyone at times of peak demand. Instead, it uses personal data – browsing history, location, purchase patterns, even device type – to charge a unique price based on what algorithms predict you’re willing to pay. The goal is to discover each customer’s “reservation price” – the most they’ll pay before walking away. Until recently, this was extremely difficult to do , but modern data collection has made it increasingly feasible. An FTC investigation found that companies track highly personal consumer behaviors to set individualized prices. For example, a new parent searching for “baby thermometers” might find pricier products on the first page of their results than a nonparent would. It’s not surprising that many people think this is unfair. The unintended progressive tax But consider this: Surveillance pricing also means that wealthy customers pay more for identical goods, while lower-income customers pay less. That means it could achieve redistribution goals typically pursued through government policy. Pharmaceutical companies already do this globally, charging wealthier countries more for identical drugs to make medications accessible in poorer nations. Surveillance pricing could function as a private-sector progressive tax system . Economists call it “ price discrimination ,” but it often helps poorer consumers access goods they might otherwise be unable to afford. And unlike government programs, this type of redistribution requires no taxpayer funding. When Amazon’s algorithm charges me more than a college student for the same laptop, it’s effectively running a means-tested subsidy program – funded by consumers. PBS NewsHour featured a segment on the Delta Air Lines news. The two-tier economy problem In my view, the most legitimate concern about surveillance pricing isn’t that it exists, but how it’s implemented. Online retailers can seamlessly adjust prices in real time, while physical stores remain largely stuck with uniform pricing. Imagine the customer fury if Target’s checkout prices varied by person based on their smartphone data : There could be chaos in the stores. This digital-physical divide could also create unfair advantages for tech-savvy companies while leaving traditional retailers behind. That would raise fairness considerations for consumers as well as retailers. This is related to another force that could limit how far surveillance pricing can go: arbitrage , or the practice of buying something where it is cheaper and selling it where it is more expensive. If a system consistently charges wealthy customers $500 for items that cost poor customers $200, it creates opportunities for entrepreneurial intermediaries to exploit these price gaps. Personal shopping services, buying cooperatives or even friends and family networks could arbitrage these differences, providing wealthy customers access to the lower prices while splitting the savings. This means surveillance pricing can’t discriminate too aggressively – market forces will erode excessive price gaps. That’s why I believe the solution isn’t to ban surveillance pricing entirely, but to monitor how it is put in practice. The regulatory sweet spot The current political moment offers a strange opportunity. With Republicans focused on AI innovation and Democrats fixated on bans, there’s space for a more sophisticated position that embraces market-based redistribution while demanding strong consumer protections. In my view, smart regulation would require companies to disclose when personal data influences pricing, and would prohibit discrimination based on protected characteristics such as race, color or religion – and this list needs to be created extremely carefully. This would preserve the efficiency benefits while preventing abuse. Surveillance pricing based on desperation or need also raises unique ethical questions. Charging a wealthier customer more for a taxi ride is one thing; charging someone extra solely because their battery is low and they risk being stranded is another. As I see it, the distinction between ability to pay and urgency of need must become the cornerstone of regulation. While distinguishing the two may seem challenging, it’s far from impossible. It would help if customers were empowered to report exploitative practices, using mechanisms similar to existing price-gouging protections . A solid regulatory framework must also clarify the difference between dynamic pricing and surveillance-based exploitation. Dynamic pricing has long been standard practice: Airlines charge all last-minute travelers higher fares, regardless of their circumstances. But consider two passengers buying tickets on the same day – one rushing to a funeral, another planning a spontaneous vacation. Right now, airlines can use technology to identify and exploit the funeral attendee’s desperate circumstances. The policy challenge is precise: Can we design regulations that prevent airlines from exploiting the bereaved while still allowing retailers to offer discounts on laptops to lower-income families? The answer will determine whether surveillance pricing becomes a tool for equity or exploitation.",https://theconversation.com/in-defense-of-surveillance-pricing-why-personalized-prices-could-be-an-unexpected-force-for-equity-266293,Society,theconversation.com,Aradhna Krishna,https://images.theconversation.com/files/695678/original/file-20251010-66-cq1re2.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&rect=0%2C503%2C6000%2C3000&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop,2025-10-14T12:37:36+00:00,09222293eca16b05812dad43e9fb178f14f5106b
92790c47ff51,Starbucks wants you to stay awhile – but shuttering itsmobile-onlypickup locations could be a risky move,"business, coffee, coffee shops, consumers, dining, dunkin', economics, fast food, marketing, restaurants, starbucks, third places","When Starbucks announced that it would phase out its mobile-order pickup-only locations beginning in 2026, it raised a question: Why abandon a format seemingly built for speed and efficiency? As Starbucks CEO Brian Niccol explained the decision in an earnings call, the pickup-only stores had a “transactional” feel, lacking “the warmth and human connection that defines our brand.” While Niccol also touted the mobile-order options at its traditional coffee shops, I see Starbucks’ move as an attempt to return to its roots as a “ third place ” – a destination between home and work where people can gather and connect. But this sort of pivot comes with trade-offs – and it creates interesting market opportunities for competitors. As a marketing professor and a coffee connoisseur, I’m offering this analysis to go with your morning cup of joe. The two types of coffee shop patrons In general, coffee shops attract two distinct customer segments. The first are what I call “stay-and-savor” customers – people who mostly use the site as a place to meet others or work. Their primary interest is in the space, not the mocha or muffins. The second are “grab-and-go” customers – people who want a consistent product, delivered efficiently. They don’t linger at the store, so the place is less important to them than convenience, speed and product quality. Think of the morning rush at your local coffee joint. Starbucks’ pickup-only stores , branded as Starbucks PICK UP , cater to grab-and-go customers. If you don’t live in a busy area, you might never have heard of the brand: There are fewer than 100 Starbucks PICK UPs, many in densely packed cities. In contrast, there are about 17,000 sit-in Starbucks stores across the United States. That means its plan will affect just 0.5% of its locations. That’s not very much. So why does this change have me a little, well, steamed up? Back to the third place, whether you like it or not As I said before, I see this move as part of an effort to emphasize “stay-and-savor” customers over their “grab-and-go” counterparts. Indeed, Niccol’s recent earnings call presentation claimed that Starbucks is “ prioritizing warmth, connection and community .” Starbucks also publishes a document stating its “ principles for upholding the third place ,” and its commitment seems to be more than just rhetorical. The problem is that coffee shops aren’t like regular restaurants in terms of menu prices and customer spending. “Stay-and-savor” customers are costly to serve for coffee shops, and may generate insufficient revenue, making them less profitable . That could be bad for the bottom line. The change could also have unintended consequences for workers and customers. For example, pickup-only stores allow employees to focus on food and beverage preparation, with less pressure to engage in small talk in the hopes of generating warmth and tips. Indeed, much academic research has shown that restaurant workers who serve customers report more emotional labor and stress and worse morale and well-being than those who don’t. In contrast, Starbucks’ rivals, such as Dunkin’ and the Chinese new entrant Luckin Coffee , have embraced the grab-and-go customers. These rivals provide space for seating space, but they don’t elevate their positioning as if their baristas are serving warmth, connection and community. Starbucks CEO Niccol has described the plan as a “ sunsetting .” I’d watch out for Dunkin’ and Luckin Coffee, and of course, Starbucks’ financials in 2026, to determine whether the Starbucks sun sets or rises.",https://theconversation.com/starbucks-wants-you-to-stay-awhile-but-shuttering-its-mobile-only-pickup-locations-could-be-a-risky-move-262591,Society,theconversation.com,Vivek Astvansh,https://images.theconversation.com/files/692291/original/file-20250922-76-3wrvy7.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&rect=0%2C354%2C3266%2C1633&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop,2025-10-14T12:37:25+00:00,7a03e1dce0813f3a32422e5edb156b299048b599
913eebb72f7c,Industrial facilities owned by profitable companies release more of their toxic waste into the environment,"air pollution, corporations, pollution, toxic chemicals, toxic waste, us environmental protection agency, waste disposal, water pollution","How much pollution a facility engaged in production or resource extraction emits isn’t just based on its location, its industry or the type of work it does. That’s what our team of environmental and financial economists found when we examined how corporate characteristics shape pollution emissions. Pollution emissions rates also vary with specific characteristics of the company that owns the facility – such as how many patents it holds, how profitable it is and how many employees it has, according to an analysis we have conducted of corporate pollution data . We found that industrial and mining facilities owned by profitable companies with relatively few patents and fewer employees tend to release higher proportions of their toxic waste into the environment – into the air, into water or onto soil. By contrast, industrial sites owned by unprofitable companies with higher levels of innovation and more personnel tend to handle higher proportions of their toxic waste in more environmentally responsible ways, such as processing them into nontoxic forms or recycling them, or burning them to generate energy. Corporations publish their pollution data A 1986 federal law requires companies that are in certain industries, employ more than 10 people and make, use or process significant amounts of certain toxic or dangerous chemicals to tell the government where those chemicals go after the company is done with them. That data is collected by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency in a database called the Toxics Release Inventory . That data includes information about the companies, their facilities and locations, and what they do with their waste chemicals. The goal is not only to inform the public about which dangerous chemicals are being used in their communities, but also to encourage companies to use cleaner methods and handle their waste in ways that are more environmentally responsible. Overall, U.S. companies reported releasing to the environment 3.3 billion pounds of toxic chemicals (1.5 billion kg) in 2023, a 21% decrease from 2014 . The decline reflects increased waste management, adoption of pollution prevention and cleaner technologies, in addition to the fact that disclosure requirements motivate companies to reduce releases. The 2023 releases came from over 21,600 industrial facilities in all 50 states and various U.S. territories, including Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, Guam and American Samoa. One-fifth of the facilities reporting toxic releases in 2023 were in Texas, Ohio and California . What kinds of businesses release toxic pollution? Metal mining, chemical manufacturing, primary metals, natural gas processing and electric utilities represent the top five polluting industrial sectors in the U.S. Combined, businesses in those sectors accounted for 78% of the toxic chemicals released in 2023 . Research has found that, often, higher levels of toxic chemical releases come from industrial facilities in less populated, economically disadvantaged, rural or minority communities. But geography and population are not the whole story. Even within the same area, some facilities pollute a lot less than others. Our inquiry into the differences between those facilities has found that corporate characteristics matter a lot – such as operational size, innovative capacity and financial strength. In our analysis, we combined the data companies reported to the EPA about toxic chemical releases with financial information on those companies and ZIP-code level geographic and demographic data. We found that corporate characteristics like profitability, employment size and number of patents are more strongly connected with toxic chemical releases than a community’s population density, minority-group percentage or household income. We looked at what percentage of its toxic chemical waste a facility or mine released to the environment versus how much it treated, recycled or incinerated. The average facility in our sample, which included 1,976 facilities owned by companies for which financial data is available, released about 39% of its toxic chemical waste to the environment, whether to air, water or land – with the remaining 61% of it managed through recycling, treatment or energy recovery either on-site or off-site. But facilities in different industries have different release rates. For example, about 99% of toxic chemicals from coal mines are released to the environment, compared with 81% for natural gas extraction, recovery and processing; 25% for power-generating electric utilities; and less than 3% for electrical equipment manufacturers. The role of innovation One corporate attribute we examined was innovation, which we measured by counting corporations’ patent families , which are groups of patent documents related to the same invention, even if they are filed in different countries. We found that companies with more patent families tend to release less of their toxic waste to the environment. Specifically, facilities owned by the top 25% of companies, when rated by innovation, released an average of 32.5% of their toxic waste to the environment, which is 8 percentage points lower than the average of facilities owned by the remaining companies in the sample. We hypothesize that innovation may give firms a competitive advantage that also enables them to adopt cleaner production technologies or invest in more environmentally conscious methods of handling waste containing toxic chemicals, thereby preventing toxic chemicals from being directly released to the environment. Size and profitability matter, too We also looked at companies’ size – in terms of number of employees – and their profitability, to see how those connected with pollution rates at the facilities the company owns. We found that larger companies, those with more than 19,000 employees, own facilities that release an average of 31% of their toxic chemical waste to the environment. By contrast, facilities owned by midsized companies, from 1,000 to 19,000 workers, release 45%, on average. Those owned by smaller companies, with less than 1,000 employees, release an average of 42% of their toxic chemical waste to the environment. An important note is that those larger companies, which are more likely to have multiple locations, often own facilities that handle larger volumes of chemicals. So even if they release smaller proportions of their toxic waste to the environment, that may still add up to larger quantities. We also found that industrial facilities owned by profitable firms have higher average rates of releasing toxic chemicals to the environment than those owned by unprofitable companies. Facilities owned by companies with positive net income, according to their income statements obtained from PitchBook , a company that collects data on corporations, released an average of 40% of their toxic-chemical-containing wastes to the environment. Facilities owned by companies with negative net income released an average of 31% of their toxic chemical waste to the environment. To us, that indicates that financially strong companies are not necessarily more environmentally responsible. That may be evidence that profitable firms make money in part by contaminating the environment rather than paying for pollution prevention or cleanup. Our analysis shows that geography and demographics alone do not fully account for industries’ and facilities’ differing levels of pollution. Corporate characteristics are also key factors in how toxic waste is handled and disposed of.",https://theconversation.com/industrial-facilities-owned-by-profitable-companies-release-more-of-their-toxic-waste-into-the-environment-265227,Society,theconversation.com,Jennifer Brodmann,https://images.theconversation.com/files/695222/original/file-20251008-64-dvv70r.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&rect=0%2C500%2C6000%2C3000&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop,2025-10-14T12:37:05+00:00,739e06092abd4ff9c2feddd332d4e2832197e392
b2c4b21b9693,Supreme Court redistricting ruling could upend decades of voting rights law – and tilt the balance of power in Washington,"civil rights, racial gerrymandering, redistricting, us supreme court, voting rights act, minority representation","On Oct. 15, 2025, the Supreme Court hears oral arguments in one of the most anticipated cases of the 2025-2026 term, Louisiana v. Callais , with major implications for the Voting Rights Act, racial representation and Democratic Party power in congress. The central question in the case is to what extent race can, or must, be used when congressional districts are redrawn. Plaintiffs are challenging whether the longstanding interpretation of Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act , which requires protection of minority voting power in redistricting, violates the Equal Protection Clause of the U.S. Constitution , which guarantees that individuals should be treated the same by the law. In short, the plaintiffs argue that the state of Louisiana’s use of race to make a second Black-majority district is forbidden by the U.S. Constitution. This is the second time that the court will hear oral arguments in Louisiana v. Callais after no decision was reached last term . From my perspective as a scholar of U.S. federal courts and electoral systems , this case represents the collision of decades of Supreme Court decisions on race, redistricting and the Voting Rights Act. Long legal battle To understand the stakes of the current case, it’s important to know what the Voting Rights Act does. Initially passed in 1965, the act helped end decades of racially discriminatory voting laws by providing federal enforcement of voting rights. Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act forbids discrimination by states in relation to voting rights and has been used for decades to challenge redistricting plans. The current case has its roots in the redistricting of Louisiana’s congressional districts following the 2020 Census. States are required to redraw districts each decade based on new population data. Louisiana lawmakers redrew the state’s six congressional districts without major changes in 2022. State troopers in Selma, Ala., swing billy clubs on March 7, 1965, to break up a march by advocates for Black Americans’ voting rights. AP Photo, File Soon after the state redistricted, a group of Black voters challenged the map in federal court as a violation of the Voting Rights Act. The plaintiffs argued that the new map was discriminatory because the voting power of Black citizens in the state was being illegally diluted. The state’s population was 31% Black , but only one of the six districts featured a majority-Black population. The federal courts in 2022 sided with the plaintiffs’ claim that the plan did violate the Voting Rights Act and ordered the state legislature to redraw the congressional plan with a second Black-majority district. The judges relied on an interpretation of Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act from a 1986 Supreme Court decision in the case known as Thornburg v. Gingles . Under this interpretation, Section 2’s nondiscrimination requirement means that congressional districts must be drawn in a way that allows large, politically cohesive and compact racial minorities to be able to elect representatives of their choice. In 2023, the Supreme Court upheld a lower court’s interpretation of Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act in a similar racial gerrymandering case in Alabama . Louisiana lawmakers redraw districts Following the court order, the Louisiana state legislature passed Senate Bill 8 in January 2024, redrawing the congressional map and creating two districts where Black voters composed a substantial portion of the electorate in compliance with the Gingles ruling. This map was used in the 2024 congressional election and both Black-majority districts elected Democrats, while the other four districts elected Republicans. These new congressional districts from Senate Bill 8 were challenged by a group of white voters in 2024 in a set of cases that became Louisiana v. Callais . The plaintiffs argued that the Louisiana legislature’s drawing of districts based on race in Senate Bill 8 was in violation of the 14th Amendment’s Equal Protection Clause , which requires equal treatment of individuals by the government, and the 15th Amendment, which forbids denying the right to vote based on race . Essentially, the plaintiffs claimed that the courts’ interpretation of Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act was unconstitutional and that the use of race to create a majority-minority district is itself discriminatory. Similar arguments about the 14th Amendment’s Equal Protection Clause were also the basis of the Supreme Court’s recent decisions striking down race-based affirmative action in college admissions . In 2024, a three-judge district court sided with the white plaintiffs in Louisiana v. Callais, with a 2-1 decision. The Black plaintiffs from the original case , and the state of Louisiana, appealed the case to the Supreme Court . The court originally heard the case at the end of the 2024-2025 term before ordering the case re-argued for 2025-2026. The Louisiana state Capitol in Baton Rouge. AP Photo/Stephen Smith, File High stakes and significant precedent If the Supreme Court ultimately upholds the lower court decision in Louisiana v. Callais, deciding that Louisiana’s congressional districts are unconstitutional racial gerrymanders, it will have substantial impacts on minority representation. The decision would upend decades of precedent for Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act. For 39 years , Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act has required redistricting institutions to consider racial and ethnic minority representation when devising congressional districts. Majority-minority districting is required when a state has large, compact and cohesive minority communities. Historically, some states have redistricted minority communities in ways that dilute their voting power, such as “cracking” a community into multiple districts where they compose a small percentage of the electorate. Section 2 also provides voters and residents with a legal tool that has been used to challenge districts as discriminatory. Many voters and groups have used Section 2 successfully to challenge redistricting plans. Section 2 has been the main legal tool for challenging racial discrimination in redistricting for the past decade. In 2013, the Supreme Court effectively ended the other major component of the Voting Rights Act, the preclearance provision, which required certain states to have changes to their elections laws approved by the federal government , including redistricting. If the court overrules the current interpretation of Section 2, it would limit the legality of using race in redistricting, end requirements for majority-minority districts and eliminate the most common way to challenge discriminatory districting. Additionally, because of the strong relationship between many minority communities and the Democratic party , the court’s decision has major implications for partisan control of the House of Representatives. If Section 2 no longer required majority-minority districts, then Republicans could use the ruling to redraw congressional districts across the country to benefit their party. Politico reported that Democrats could lose as many as 19 House seats if the Supreme Court sides with the lower court. Recent Supreme Court precedent gives conflicting signals as to how it will decide this case. In 2023, the court rejected a challenge to Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act related to Alabama’s congressional districts. In 2024, the court overruled a lower court’s finding of racial vote dilution in South Carolina .",https://theconversation.com/supreme-court-redistricting-ruling-could-upend-decades-of-voting-rights-law-and-tilt-the-balance-of-power-in-washington-267269,Society,theconversation.com,Sam D.

fc036cb66964,"‘Space tornadoes’ could cause geomagnetic storms – but these phenomena, spun off ejections from the Sun, aren’t easy to study","computer simulations, coronal mass ejection, geomagnetic storm, interstellar medium, new research, steehm new research, solar storm, solar wind, space, space weather, sun","Weather forecasting is a powerful tool. During hurricane season, for instance, meteorologists create computer simulations to forecast how these destructive storms form and where they might travel, which helps prevent damage to coastal communities. When you’re trying to forecast space weather, rather than storms on Earth, creating these simulations gets a little more complex . To simulate space weather, you would need to fit the Sun, the planets and the vast empty space between them in a virtual environment, also known as a simulation box, where all the calculations would take place. Space weather is very different from the storms you see on Earth. These events come from the Sun, which ejects eruptions of charged particles and magnetic fields from its surface. The most powerful of these events are called interplanetary coronal mass ejections , or CMEs, which travel at speeds approaching 1,800 miles per second (2,897 kilometers per second). To put that in perspective, a single CME could move a mass of material equivalent to all the Great Lakes from New York City to Los Angeles in just under two seconds – almost faster than it takes to say “space weather.” When these CMEs hit Earth, they can cause geomagnetic storms , which manifest in the sky as beautiful auroras. These storms can also damage key technological infrastructure, such as by interfering with the flow of electricity in the power grid and causing transformers to overheat and fail . Geomagnetic storms, caused by space weather, produce beautiful light shows, but they can also damage satellites. Frank Olsen, Norway/Moment via Getty Images To better understand how these storms can wreak so much havoc , our research team created simulations to show how storms interact with Earth’s natural magnetic shield and trigger the dangerous geomagnetic activity that can shut down electric grids. In a study published in October 2025 in the Astrophysical Journal, we modeled one of the sources of these geomagnetic storms: small, tornado-like vortices spun off of an ejection from the Sun. These vortices are called flux ropes, and satellites had previously observed small flux ropes – but our work helped uncover how they are generated. The challenge Our team started this research in summer 2023, when one of us, a space weather expert , spotted inconsistencies in space weather observations. This work had found geomagnetic storms occurring during periods when no solar eruptions were predicted to hit Earth. Bewildered, the space weather expert wanted to know if there could be space weather events that were smaller than coronal mass ejections and did not originate directly from solar eruptions. He predicted that such events might form in the space between the Sun and Earth, instead of in the Sun’s atmosphere. One example of such smaller space weather events is a magnetic flux rope – bundles of magnetic fields wrapped around each other like a rope. Its detection in computer simulations of solar eruptions would hint to where these space weather events may be forming. Unlike satellite observations, in simulations you can turn back the clock or track an event upstream to see where they originate. Sometimes the Sun ejects masses of plasma and magnetic field lines, called coronal mass ejections. So he asked the other author, a leading simulation expert . It turned out that finding smaller space weather events was not as simple as simulating a big solar eruption and letting the computer model run long enough for the eruption to reach Earth. Current computer simulations are not meant to resolve these smaller events. Instead, they are designed to focus on the large solar eruptions because these have the most effects on infrastructure on Earth. This shortfall was quite disappointing. It was like trying to forecast a hurricane with a simulation that only shows you global weather patterns. Because you can’t see a hurricane at that scale, you would completely miss it. These larger-scale simulations are known as global simulations. They study how solar eruptions form on the Sun’s surface and travel through space. These simulations treat streams of charged particles and magnetic fields floating through space as fluids to reduce the computational cost, compared with modeling every charged particle independently. It’s like measuring the overall temperature of water in a bottle, instead of tracking every single water molecule individually. Because these simulations are computational phenomena that happen across such a vast space, they can’t resolve every detail. To affordably resolve the vast space between the Sun and the planets, researchers divide the space into large cubes – analogous to two-dimensional pixels in a camera. In the simulation, these cubes each represent an area 1 million miles (1.6 million kilometers) wide, tall and across. That distance is equivalent to about 1% of the distance from Earth to the Sun. The search begins Our search began with what felt like hunting for a needle in a haystack. We were looking into old global simulations, searching for a tiny, transient blob – which would signify a flux rope – within an area of space hundreds of times wider than the Sun itself. Our initial search did not yield anything. We then shifted our focus to the simulations of the May 2024 solar eruption event . This time, we specifically looked at the region where the solar eruption collided into a quiet flow of charged particles and magnetic fields, called the solar wind , ahead of it. There it was: a distinct system of magnetic flux ropes . However, our excitement was short-lived. We could not tell where these flux ropes came from. The modeled flux ropes were also too small to survive, eventually fizzling out because they became too small to resolve with our simulation grid. But that was the type of clue we needed – the presence of flux ropes at the location where the solar eruption collided with the solar wind. To settle the issue, we decided to bridge this gap and create a computer model with a finer grid size than those previous global simulations used. Since increasing the resolution across the entire simulation space would have been prohibitively expensive, we decided to only increase the simulation resolution along the trajectory of the flux ropes. The new simulations could now resolve features that spanned distances six times Earth’s 8,000-mile (or 128,000-kilometer) diameter down to tens of thousands of miles – nearly 100 times better than previous simulations. A comparison of low and enhanced simulation grid sizes. We identified one flux rope in the original, low-resolution simulation, but it soon fizzled out. When we improved the simulation grid, we could see multiple flux ropes. CC BY-NC-ND Making the discovery Once we designed and tested the simulation grid, it was time to simulate that same solar eruption that led to the formation of those flux ropes in the less fine-grained model. We wanted to study the formation of those flux ropes and how they grew, changed shape and possibly terminated in the narrow wedge encompassing the space between the Sun and Earth. The results were astonishing. The high-resolution view revealed that the flux ropes formed when the solar eruption slammed into the slower solar wind ahead of it. The new structures possessed incredible complexity and strength that persisted far longer than we expected. In meteorological terms, it was like watching a hurricane spawn a cluster of tornadoes. We found that the magnetic fields in these vortices were strong enough to trigger a significant geomagnetic storm and cause some real trouble here on Earth. But most importantly, the simulations confirmed that there are indeed space weather events that form locally in the space between the Sun and Earth. Our next step is to simulate how such tornado-like features in the solar wind may impact our planet and infrastructure. This two-dimensional cut of the simulation box shows a solar eruption that moves toward Earth quickly. The eruption slams into the slower solar wind ahead of it, causing the formation of a constellation of magnetic flux ropes. The magnetic flux ropes appear as islands in the simulation box. The solid lines represent magnetic field lines, and the color bar shows the number of charged particles. Flux ropes move toward Earth upon formation in the solar wind. The video also shows how the Space Weather Investigation Frontier space mission, or SWIFT, a constellation of four satellites forming a tetrahedron configuration, could examine the formation and growth of these structures in the solar wind. Watching these flux ropes in the simulation form so quickly and move toward Earth was exciting, but concerning. It was exciting because this discovery could help us better plan for future extreme space weather events. It was at the same time concerning because these flux ropes would only appear as a small blip in today’s space weather monitors . We would need multiple satellites to directly see these flux ropes in greater detail so that scientists can more reliably predict whether, when and in what orientation they may affect our planet and what the outcome may be. The good news is that scientists and engineers are developing the next-generation space missions that could address this.",https://theconversation.com/space-tornadoes-could-cause-geomagnetic-storms-but-these-phenomena-spun-off-ejections-from-the-sun-arent-easy-to-study-266567,Society,theconversation.com,Mojtaba Akhavan-Tafti,https://images.theconversation.com/files/695741/original/file-20251011-56-11n5sl.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&rect=0%2C237%2C2200%2C1100&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop,2025-10-13T13:43:52+00:00,44bc58e2eea963fa2f793335b4e08368a70f6d6c
e33617872b27,Far fewer Americans support political violence than recent polls suggest,"artificial intelligence (ai), national guard, political violence, polling, protest, public opinion, trump administration, us politics","A series of recent events has sparked alarm about rising levels of political violence in the U.S. These episodes include the assassination of political activist Charlie Kirk on Sept. 10, 2025; the murder of a Democratic Minnesota state legislator and her husband in June 2025; and two attempts to kill Donald Trump during the 2024 presidential campaign. Some surveys have reported that a large number of Americans are willing to support the use of force for political ends , or they believe that political violence may sometimes be justified . My research is in political science and data analytics . I have  conducted surveys for almost 25 years. For the past three years, I have studied new techniques that leverage artificial intelligence to conduct and analyze interviews. My own recent surveys, which use AI to ask people about why they give their answers, show that the surprisingly high level of support in response to these questions is likely the result of confusion about what these questions are asking, not actual support for political violence. Law enforcement officials lead a procession as pallbearers carry caskets after a funeral ceremony for Minnesota state Rep. Melissa Hortman and her husband, Mark Hortman, on June 28, 2025, in Minneapolis. Stephen Maturen/Getty Images A failure to communicate Why would multiple surveys get the answers to this important question wrong? I believe the cause is an issue called response error. It means that respondents don’t interpret a question in the way the researcher thinks they will. As a result, the answers people provide don’t really reflect what the researcher thinks the answers show. For example, asking whether someone would support the use of force to achieve a political goal raises the question of what the respondent thinks “use of force” means in this context. It could be interpreted as violence, but it could also be interpreted as using legal means to “force” someone to do something. Such response errors have been a concern for pollsters ever since survey research began . They can affect even seemingly straightforward questions. What did you mean by that? To avoid this problem, I used an AI interviewing system developed by CloudResearch , a well-known survey research company, to ask respondents some of the same questions about political violence from previous surveys. Then I used it to ask what they were thinking when they answered those questions. This process is called cognitive interviewing . I then used AI to go through these interviews and categorize them. Two short reports that summarize this process as applied to both polls are available online . These analyses have not been peer-reviewed, and the results should be considered very preliminary. Nonetheless, the results clearly demonstrate that respondents interpret these questions in very different ways. Nuance matters For example, in my survey, about 33% of Democrats agreed with the statement that “use of force is justified to remove President Trump from office.” However, when asked why they agreed, more than 57% gave responses like this: “I was not thinking physically but more in the sense that he – the president – might need to be ‘fired’ or forced out of office due to rules or laws.” Still others were envisioning future scenarios where a president illegally seizes power in a coup. Once you account for these different interpretations of the question, the AI only coded about 8% of Democrats as supporting use of force in violent terms under current conditions. Even here, there was substantial ambiguity – for example, this type of response was not unusual: “The language ‘use of force’ was a bit too broad for me. I could not justify killing Trump, for example, but less extreme uses of force were valid in my eyes.” Similarly, 29% of Republicans agreed that “use of the military is justified to stop protests against President Trump’s agenda.” However, almost all of the respondents who agreed with this statement envisioned the National Guard interceding nonviolently to stop violent protests and riots. Only about 2.6% of Republicans gave comments supporting use of the military against nonviolent protests. Almost all those who agreed that use of the military was justified expressed thoughts like this: “I see the military coming and acting as a police force to stop or prevent the demonstrations that become violent. Peaceful protesters must be allowed to exercise their right to free speech.” People prepare to march in a ‘No Kings’ protest against Trump administration policies in New York City on June 14, 2025. Michael M. Santiago/Getty Images When is political violence justified? Even questions that explicitly ask about political violence are open to wide interpretation. Take, for example, this question: “Do you think it is ever justified for citizens to resort to violence in order to achieve political goals?” The lack of a specific scenario or location in this question invites respondents to engage in all kinds of philosophical and historical speculation. In my survey, almost 15% of respondents said violence could sometimes be justified. When asked about the examples they were thinking of, respondents cited the American Revolution, the anti-Nazi French Resistance and many other incidents as a reason for their responses. Only about 3% of respondents said they were thinking about actions in the U.S. at the current time. Moreover, almost all respondents stated that violence should be a last resort when all other peaceful and legal methods fail. One respondent illustrated both problems with one sentence: “The (American) colonists tried petitions and negotiations first, but, when those efforts failed, they resorted to armed conflict to gain independence.” A call for understanding Even these numbers likely overestimate Americans’ support for political violence. I read the interviews, checking the AI system’s labeling, and concluded that, if anything, it was overestimating support for violence. Other factors may also be distorting reports of public support for political violence. Many surveys are conducted primarily online. One study estimated that anywhere from 4% to 7% of respondents in online surveys are “ bogus respondents ” who are selecting arbitrary responses. Another study reported that such respondents dramatically increase positive responses on questions about political violence. Respondents may also be willing to espouse attitudes anonymously online that they would never say or do in real life. Studies have suggested that “ online disinhibition effects ” or “ survey trolling ” can impact survey results. In sum, my preliminary research suggests that response error is a substantial problem in surveys about political violence. Americans almost universally condemn the recent political violence they have witnessed. The recent poll results showing otherwise more likely stem from confusion about what the questions are asking than actual support for political violence.",https://theconversation.com/far-fewer-americans-support-political-violence-than-recent-polls-suggest-266113,Society,theconversation.com,Ryan Kennedy,https://images.theconversation.com/files/695510/original/file-20251009-66-bdh2nw.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&rect=0%2C45%2C5141%2C2570&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop,2025-10-13T12:38:15+00:00,a6b9594fc817b3ae679b6f0eb6e819316a3fdecd
4cef2a5a9728,"3-leggedlizards can thrive against all odds, challenging assumptions about how evolution works in the wild","adaptation, biology, evolution, injuries, limb loss, limbs, lizards, locomotion, mobility, natural selection, wildlife","We are lizard biologists , and to do our work we need to catch lizards – never an easy task with such fast, agile creatures. Years ago, one of us was in the Bahamas chasing a typically uncooperative lizard across dense and narrow branches, frustrated that its nimble agility was thwarting efforts to catch it. Only when finally captured did we discover this wily brown anole was missing its entire left hind leg . This astonishing observation set our research down an unexpected path. That chance encounter led us to collaborate with over 60 colleagues worldwide to document what we suspected might be a broader phenomenon. Our research uncovered 122 cases of limb loss across 58 lizard species and revealed that these “three-legged pirates” – the rare survivors of traumatic injuries – can run just as fast, maintain healthy body weight, reproduce successfully and live surprisingly long lives. To be clear, most lizards probably do not survive such devastating injuries. What we’re documenting are the exceptional cases that defy our expectations about how natural selection works. A four-horned chameleon missing its entire left forelimb in Cameroon appeared healthy when observed in the wild, despite the specialized gripping requirements of chameleons. Christopher Anderson This discovery is startling because lizard limbs represent one of biology’s most studied examples of evolutionary adaptation. For decades, scientists have demonstrated that even tiny differences in leg length between individual lizards can mean the difference between life and death – affecting their ability to escape predators, catch prey and find mates. Since subtle variations matter so much, biologists have long assumed that losing an entire limb should be catastrophic. Yet our global survey tells a different story about these remarkable survivors. Working with colleagues across six continents, we found limb-damaged lizards across nearly all major lizard families, from tiny geckos to massive iguanas. These animals had clearly healed from whatever trauma caused their injuries – likely accidents or the failed attempts of a predator to eat them. Perhaps most remarkably, we documented surviving limb loss even in chameleons, tree-climbing specialists whose movements seem to require perfect limb coordination. Thriving, not just surviving The body condition of these lizards was most surprising. Rather than appearing malnourished, many limb-damaged lizards were actually heavier than expected for their size, suggesting they were successfully finding food despite their handicap. Some were actively reproducing, with females found carrying eggs and males observed successfully mating. Limb damage can be fairly common in some lizard populations, such as these X-rays of brown anoles ( Anolis sagrei ) from the Bahamas. Jason Kolbe/Jonathan Losos These findings force us to reconsider some basic assumptions about how evolution might work in wild populations. Charles Darwin envisioned natural selection as an omnipresent force, “ daily and hourly scrutinizing ” every feature. But perhaps selection is more episodic than constant. Maybe sometimes limb length matters tremendously, while during other times – such as when food is abundant and predators are scarce – limb length matters less and three-legged lizards can flourish. These lizard survivors showcase the incredible solutions that millions of years of evolution have built into their biology. Rather than being passive victims of their injuries, these lizards may survive by actively choosing safer habitats or hunting strategies, using smart behavior to avoid situations where their disability would be a disadvantage. Biological engineering in action Our research combines old-fashioned natural history observations with cutting-edge, biomechanical analysis . We use high-speed cameras and computer software that can track movement frame by frame to analyze running mechanics invisible to the naked eye. This combination of field biology and laboratory precision allows us to understand not just that these lizards survive, but how they accomplish this remarkable feat. When we tested the three-legged lizards’ athletic performance, the results defied expectations. Some animals were clearly impaired in their sprinting capabilities, but others actually ran faster than fully-limbed individuals of the same size across a 2-meter dash during our “Lizard Olympics .” Researchers used computer software that automatically tracks movement patterns to analyze high-speed videos of lizards sprinting, such as this brown anole missing half of its right back leg. Christopher Anderson High-speed video analysis revealed their secret: The speedy survivors compensate through creative biomechanical solutions. One brown anole missing half its hind limb dramatically increased its body undulation during sprinting, using exaggerated snakelike movements to compensate for the missing leg. By documenting the unexpected – the seemingly impossible survivors – we’re reminded that nature still holds surprises that can fundamentally change how we think about life itself.",https://theconversation.com/3-legged-lizards-can-thrive-against-all-odds-challenging-assumptions-about-how-evolution-works-in-the-wild-262467,Society,theconversation.com,James T.

A chemist explains radioactivity and its health effects,"chemistry, curious kids, curious kids us, decay, isotopes, radiation, radioactivity, radium","Curious Kids is a series for children of all ages. If you have a question you’d like an expert to answer, send it to CuriousKidsUS@theconversation.com . “What is radium and why is it dangerous?” – Aurora, 10, Laredo, Texas The element radium can be found in extremely tiny amounts in the Earth’s crust and oceans, and in its pure form it is a soft silvery metal. To an untrained eye, a small piece of radium may look like a chip off a regular gray rock. But radium can invisibly emit radiation – energy and small fragments of itself – that you can’t feel, see or smell. And that invisible radiation can hurt you, without you even noticing right away. What’s going on with this silent threat that can stealthily damage your body in ways that can take years to reveal themselves? As a chemist , I’m interested in what makes different elements safe to handle or hazardous. This dangerous release of radiation is called radioactivity, and even though its source may look unassuming, it can burn you or even give you diseases that don’t manifest for years. Atoms and isotopes Everything you see around you – your skin, rocks, the pages of books – is all made up of different combinations of extremely small particles called atoms . An atom has a small, dense center called the nucleus. Negatively charged particles called electrons move around the nucleus. Inside the nucleus, there are two types of particles: positively charged protons and neutral neutrons. All atoms with the same number of protons in their nuclei are the same element . Besides radium, some elements you may have heard of are carbon and oxygen. All carbon atoms have six protons and all oxygen atoms have eight protons. Radium atoms are much heavier – all radium atoms have 88 protons. A simplified model of an atom, where the nucleus, containing neutrons and positively charged protons, sits in the center surrounded by negatively charged electrons. CNX OpenStax/Wikimedia Commons , CC BY Interestingly, it is possible for atoms of the same element to have different numbers of neutrons. Atoms of the same element with different numbers of neutrons are called isotopes. For instance, two carbon atoms would each have six protons, but one might have six neutrons while another could have seven or eight. The number of protons and neutrons packed together in the nucleus determines whether the nucleus of an isotope is stable or not. If the nucleus is not stable, problems can arise. Radioactive decay The nucleus of each atom wants to be stable, but only certain arrangements of protons and neutrons make that possible . The number of protons and neutrons do not have to be equal, but some combinations make for a happy, or stable, coexistence in the nucleus while others don’t. A nucleus with an unhappy mix of protons and neutrons might break down or deteriorate in some way. That process is called radioactivity or radioactive decay . Elements are radioactive if they decay by releasing parts of the nucleus or high-energy particles. Armtuk/Wikimedia Commons , CC BY That radioactive decay process releases some form of radiation from the nucleus . This radiation can take the form of tiny particles moving rapidly or high-energy electromagnetic waves emerging from the nucleus. It is that radiation – the high-energy particles and waves shooting out from the nucleus of unstable atomic nuclei – that can make you sick. There are different types of radioactive decay . In one case, an atom decays by kicking out a small fragment of itself that is made up of two protons and two neutrons. Since the number of protons determines what element we have, decay that changes the number of protons in an atom turns it into a different element. Radioactive decay can be quite slow, though. It can take thousands of years for one element to decay into a different one. The case of radium All radium atoms are unstable and radioactive. Many of these isotopes decay very quickly, but Ra-226, which has 138 neutrons and 88 protons and is the most common, decays the slowest . It takes 1,600 years for half a sample of Ra-226 to decay. Radium undergoes alpha decay, where it loses a fragment of its nucleus containing two protons and two neutrons, after which it becomes radon. MikeRun/Wikimedia Commons , CC BY-SA As Ra-226 decays, it loses two protons and two neutrons, which turns it into an isotope of radon . Then the radon decays, and the atom eventually reaches a stable form as the element lead. Each step in that decay series releases more nuclear radiation. Some other elements in nature with no stable isotope are technetium, polonium, actinium and uranium. Effects on the human body The nuclear radiation emitted when radium and other elements decay can damage the cells in the human body. It can lead to cancers or other health problems . Marie and Pierre Curie experimented with radium, which ended up causing health complications for them. André Castaigne Whether you’re exposed to a lot of radiation quickly, like making the mistake of walking around for a few hours with radioactive material in your pocket , or you’re exposed to just a little over a long time , the high-energy particles and electromagnetic waves from nuclear radiation can lead to serious health problems , including burns and cancers . Remarkably, even though radioactivity is a threat to life, scientists can control and use it to diagnose and treat diseases – including cancers . If the radiation is delivered precisely to where cancer cells are, the radiation can destroy those rogue cells wreaking havoc in the body. People who work professionally with radioactive materials need to follow strict guidelines and procedures to protect themselves. They use special shields and radiation detectors, and they minimize the amount of time they’re exposed to any radioactivity. Pierre and Marie Curie, who discovered radium in 1898, suffered some of the negative effects of radioactivity. Pierre experienced radioactive burns , and Marie died from a blood disease likely caused by chronic radiation exposure . Over 100 years later, her notebooks are still radioactive .

4d97e3448b19,"What are climate tipping points? They sound scary, especially for ice sheets and oceans, but there’s still room for optimism","amoc, amazon, antarctica, brazil, climate change, coral reefs, corals, east antarctic ice sheet, environment, greenland, greenland ice sheet, ice sheets, oceans, tipping points","As the planet warms, it risks crossing catastrophic tipping points: thresholds where Earth systems, such as ice sheets and rain forests, change irreversibly over human lifetimes. Scientists have long warned that if global temperatures warmed more than 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 Fahrenheit) compared with before the Industrial Revolution, and stayed high, they would increase the risk of passing multiple tipping points . For each of these elements, like the Amazon rain forest or the Greenland ice sheet, hotter temperatures lead to melting ice or drier forests that leave the system more vulnerable to further changes. Worse, these systems can interact. Freshwater melting from the Greenland ice sheet can weaken ocean currents in the North Atlantic , disrupting air and ocean temperature patterns and marine food chains . Pink circles show the systems closest to tipping points. Some would have regional effects, such as loss of coral reefs. Others are global, such as the beginning of the collapse of the Greenland ice sheet. Global Tipping Points Report , CC BY-ND With these warnings in mind, 194 countries a decade ago set 1.5 C as a goal they would try not to cross. Yet in 2024, the planet temporarily breached that threshold . The term “tipping point” is often used to illustrate these problems, but apocalyptic messages can leave people feeling helpless, wondering if it’s pointless to slam the brakes. As a geoscientist who has studied the ocean and climate for over a decade and recently spent a year on Capitol Hill working on bipartisan climate policy , I still see room for optimism. It helps to understand what a tipping point is – and what’s known about when each might be reached. Tipping points are not precise A tipping point is a metaphor for runaway change. Small changes can push a system out of balance. Once past a threshold, the changes reinforce themselves, amplifying until the system transforms into something new. Almost as soon as “tipping points” entered the climate science lexicon — following Malcolm Gladwell’s 2000 book, “The Tipping Point: How Little Things Can Make a Big Difference” — scientists warned the public not to confuse global warming policy benchmarks with precise thresholds . The Greenland ice sheet, which is 1.9 miles (3 kilometers) thick at its thickest point, has been losing mass for several years as temperatures rise and more of its ice is lost to the ocean. A tipping point would mean runaway ice loss, with the potential to eventually raise sea level 24 feet (7.4 meters) and shut down a crucial ocean circulation. Sean Gallup/Getty Images The scientific reality of tipping points is more complicated than crossing a temperature line. Instead, different elements in the climate system have risks of tipping that increase with each fraction of a degree of warming. For example, the beginning of a slow collapse of the Greenland ice sheet, which could raise global sea level by about 24 feet (7.4 meters), is one of the most likely tipping elements in a world more than 1.5 C warmer than preindustrial times. Some models place the critical threshold at 1.6 C (2.9 F). More recent simulations estimate runaway conditions at 2.7 C (4.9 F) of warming. Both simulations consider when summer melt will outpace winter snow, but predicting the future is not an exact science. Gradients show science-based estimates from the Global Tipping Points Report of when some key global or regional climate tipping points are increasingly likely to be reached. Every fraction of a degree increases the likeliness, reflected in the warming color. Global Tipping Points Report 2025 , CC BY-ND Forecasts like these are generated using powerful climate models that simulate how air, oceans, land and ice interact. These virtual laboratories allow scientists to run experiments, increasing the temperature bit by bit to see when each element might tip. Climate scientist Timothy Lenton first identified climate tipping points in 2008 . In 2022, he and his team revisited temperature collapse ranges , integrating over a decade of additional data and more sophisticated computer models. Their nine core tipping elements include large-scale components of Earth’s climate, such as ice sheets, rain forests and ocean currents. They also simulated thresholds for smaller tipping elements that pack a large punch, including die-offs of coral reefs and widespread thawing of permafrost . The world may have already passed one tipping point, according to the 2025 Global Tipping Points Report: Corals reefs are dying as marine temperatures rise. Healthy reefs are essential fish nurseries and habitat and also help protect coastlines from storm erosion. Once they die, their structures begin to disintegrate. Vardhan Patankar/Wikimedia Commons , CC BY-SA Some tipping elements, such as the East Antarctic ice sheet, aren’t in immediate danger . The ice sheet’s stability is due to its massive size – nearly six times that of the Greenland ice sheet – making it much harder to push out of equilibrium. Model results vary, but they generally place its tipping threshold between 5 C (9 F) and 10 C (18 F) of warming. Other elements, however, are closer to the edge. Alarm bells sounding in forests and oceans In the Amazon, self-perpetuating feedback loops threaten the stability of the Earth’s largest rain forest, an ecosystem that influences global climate . As temperatures rise, drought and wildfire activity increase, killing trees and releasing more carbon into the atmosphere, which in turn makes the forest hotter and drier still. By 2050, scientists warn, nearly half of the Amazon rain forest could face multiple stressors . That pressure may trigger a tipping point with mass tree die-offs. The once-damp rain forest canopy could shift to a dry savanna for at least several centuries. Rising temperatures also threaten biodiversity underwater. The second Global Tipping Points Report , released Oct. 12, 2025, by a team of 160 scientists including Lenton, suggests tropical reefs may have passed a tipping point that will wipe out all but isolated patches. Coral loss on the Great Barrier Reef. Australian Institute of Marine Science. Corals rely on algae called zooxanthellae to thrive. Under heat stress, the algae leave their coral homes, draining reefs of nutrition and color. These mass bleaching events can kill corals, stripping the ecosystem of vital biodiversity that millions of people rely on for food and tourism. Low-latitude reefs have the highest risk of tipping, with the upper threshold at just 1.5 C, the report found. Above this amount of warming, there is a 99% chance that these coral reefs tip past their breaking point. Similar alarms are ringing for ocean currents, where freshwater ice melt is slowing down a major marine highway that circulates heat, known as the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation, or AMOC. How the Atlantic Ocean circulation would change as it slows. IPCC 6th Assessment Report The AMOC carries warm water northward from the tropics. In the North Atlantic, as sea ice forms, the surface gets colder and saltier, and this dense water sinks. The sinking action drives the return flow of cold, salty water southward, completing the circulation’s loop. But melting land ice from Greenland threatens the density-driven motor of this ocean conveyor belt by dilution: Fresher water doesn’t sink as easily. A weaker current could create a feedback loop, slowing the circulation further and leading to a shutdown within a century once it begins, according to one estimate. Like a domino, the climate changes that would accompany an AMOC collapse could worsen drought in the Amazon and accelerate ice loss in the Antarctic . Questions about closeness of other tipping points Not all scientists agree that an AMOC or rain forest collapse is close. In the Amazon, researchers recognize the forest’s changes, but some have questioned whether some of the modeled vegetation data that underpins tipping point concerns is accurate . In the North Atlantic, there are similar concerns about data showing a long-term trend . The Amazon forest has been losing tree cover to logging, farming, ranching, wildfires and a changing climate. Pink shows areas with greater than 75% tree canopy loss from 2001 to 2024. Blue is tree cover gain from 2000 to 2020. Global Forest Watch , CC BY Other changes driven by rising global temperatures, like melting permafrost , could be reversed. Permafrost, for example, could refreeze if temperatures drop again. Risks are too high to ignore Despite the uncertainty, tipping points are too risky to ignore . Rising temperatures put people and economies around the world at greater risk of dangerous conditions. But there is still room for preventive actions – every fraction of a degree in warming that humans prevent reduces the risk of runaway climate conditions. Reducing greenhouse gas emissions slows warming and tipping point risks. Tipping points highlight the stakes, but they also underscore the climate choices humanity can still make to stop the damage.

7a7202ae7ac3,How the government shutdown is making the air traffic controller shortage worse and leading to flight delays,"air travel, air travel safety, essential workers, federal aviation administration, labor rights, organized labor, us government shutdown, us shutdown, air traffic controllers","Airports across the United States have been experiencing significant flight delays recently because of a shortage of air traffic controllers, who have been required to work without pay since a government shutdown began on Oct. 1, 2025. Reports suggest employees have been calling in sick in increased numbers. And since there was already a shortage of controllers before the shutdown, the impact has been severe, with thousands of flights delayed or canceled since the shutdown began. The Conversation U.S. asked Brian Strzempkowski and Melanie Dickman , aviation experts at The Ohio State University, to explain how the shutdown is affecting air travel, what that means for passengers and air safety, as well as the air traffic controller shortage that has been plaguing U.S. airports for years. How is the shutdown affecting air traffic controllers? Air traffic controllers are deemed essential workers, meaning they are still required to work while not receiving compensation – which they would typically then receive in a lump sum after the shutdown ends. President Donald Trump created some uncertainty around this by suggesting workers may not get their back pay without explicit authorization from Congress, despite having signed a law in his first term that makes it a legal requirement. Working without regular pay, combined with the possibility that they won’t get paid at all, is resulting in real financial stress for air traffic controllers, who perform one of the most stressful jobs there is . As a result, there have been reports of air traffic controllers calling in sick in large numbers. This happened in previous shutdowns as well. During the 2018-2019 shutdown , for example, sickouts started to happen around the two-week mark, roughly when the first paycheck was missed. Controllers, airport security employees, and other essential workers were calling in sick often so they could work another part-time job to pay their bills. In the current shutdown, this appears to be happening sooner, less than a week after it began. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said around 10% of the controller workforce is engaging in this practice and threatened to fire these “problem children .” What does this mean for people about to take a flight? Before the shutdown, there was already a critical shortage of air traffic controllers. Coupled with workers calling in sick in recent days, this has led to severe travel delays at many major airports, such as those in Atlanta and Denver, and regional ones, like those serving Burbank, California, and Daytona Beach, Florida. A big question on travelers’ minds is whether this will affect air safety. The air traffic control system is multi-layered and has redundancies built into it to ensure an incredibly safe environment. While controller shortages do begin to erode some of those redundancies, contingency plans are in place to help protect the system. For example, air traffic can be diverted away from affected locations or delayed, or the flight may even be be canceled before the plane leaves the gate. As an example, Newark Liberty International Airport can accommodate approximately 80 aircraft departing or arriving per hour when the airport and airspace is fully operational. However, due to technical failures, staffing shortages and construction at the airport, capacity was limited to between 28 and 34 aircraft per hour in June 2025. Due to technology upgrades and procedural changes, that number was recently increased to between 68 and 72 aircraft per hour. By regulating the amount of traffic, the system can be protected to ensure the safety of every aircraft. This was an example of high-level oversight in which the secretary of transportation was personally involved in seeking a solution to ensure air travel remained safe while trying to increase capacity. Air traffic controllers have one of the most stressful jobs. AP Photo/Charles Rex Arbogast How does the US keep air travel safe? On a more day-to-day level, the Federal Aviation Administration relies on the Air Traffic Control System Command Center , located about 40 miles away from Washington, D.C. This facility oversees the entire national airspace system and essentially “controls” the controllers. Air traffic professionals monitor staffing at air traffic facilities, weather conditions, equipment failures and unexpected disruptions to the system. When an incident arises, such as Burbank Airport recently reporting that no controllers were available , the command center issues an alert stating that any aircraft inbound to Burbank must divert to an alternate airport, and any aircraft that has not yet taken off will be held on the ground. Staffing shortages at other air traffic control facilities may require alternate plans, such as transitioning workloads from one facility with fewer controllers, to another that is appropriately staffed. There is a wide range of tools that the Air Traffic Control System Command Center can utilize to protect the system, but it all stems from the idea of managing the capacity. Flight delays and cancellations, while disruptive to individual travelers, are actually good from a system perspective, because they prevent congestion in the airspace. Why was there an air traffic controller shortage in the first place? There has been a systemic problem with hiring of air traffic controllers for more than a decade. Over the years, the FAA has fallen behind on training enough controllers to replace those who retire each year. In May 2025, we wrote about the FAA’s plan to utilize colleges across the country to provide the professional training for this career field. While it will take a little time for the students to matriculate through college and into the workforce, this plan will be a significant contributor to solving the controller shortage problem. Meanwhile, the FAA Academy, which trains U.S. air traffic controllers, only has limited funding from the previous federal budget for current students. The shutdown means no new students can begin training. Depending on the length of the shutdown, the funding may run out as additional employees are furloughed. The ripple effects of a shutdown can remain for many months after the government reopens. What’s the government doing to end the shortage? In July, Congress authorized over US$12 billion in funding to help modernize the air traffic control system. Secretary Duffy is currently leading an effort to identify a contractor to implement the technology upgrades needed to modernize the system and make it more robust. Duffy has said an additional $19 billion investment will be needed to complete the task. The editor’s note was updated to correct the number of flights canceled during the shutdown.",https://theconversation.com/how-the-government-shutdown-is-making-the-air-traffic-controller-shortage-worse-and-leading-to-flight-delays-267093,Society,theconversation.com,Brian Strzempkowski,https://images.theconversation.com/files/695700/original/file-20251010-56-omtyeq.jpeg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&rect=0%2C0%2C6434%2C3217&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop,2025-10-11T10:34:23+00:00,bdde474c1a8d829722ec605096b6f53bf4180300
a179023641c0,"Natural World Heritage sites under growing threat, but bright spots remain","biodiversity, conservation, environment, environmental protections, iucn, okavango delta, species, unesco, unesco world heritage sites, wildlife, environmental protection","Botswana’s fertile Okavango Delta is one of the last remaining high-biodiversity ecosystems in the world, home to cheetahs, African wild dogs, baobab trees , crocodiles, termites and owls that catch fish . Roughly the size of the state of Connecticut, the freshwater Okavango Delta opens into an enormous alluvial fan that stretches up to 5,800 square miles (15,000 square km) into the Kalahari Desert. The area is so vast it can be seen from space, but most people have never heard of it. In recognition of its natural and cultural significance, the Okavango Delta was designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2014. When I conducted research in the Okavango in 2024, I witnessed both its natural beauty and the ebullient warmth of the people who live there. The health of the delta – and of 270 other natural sites across the globe – is the subject of the latest IUCN World Heritage Outlook , a recurring wellness report on the planet’s most treasured natural places. The report’s findings are not dire, but they aren’t great, either. Many of these extraordinary places are increasingly at risk due to escalating climate change, invasive species, and a lack of consistent funding to protect them. The outlook Every few years, the International Union for Conservation of Nature – a global contingent of more than 1,400 government agencies and private organizations focused on environmental conservation – evaluates the environmental and biological conditions at all UNESCO World Heritage sites selected for their natural significance. That includes the Okavango Delta in Botswana , home to the world’s largest population of African elephants; the Central Amazon Conservation Complex in Brazil ; the Socotra Archipelago in Yemen with hundreds of species of birds and fish; the Tropical Rainforest Heritage of Sumatra, Indonesia ; the Central Amazon Conservation Complex in Brazil , and Everglades National Park, Florida . The IUCN reports to UNESCO on each site’s current state and natural value , the threats it faces, the effectiveness of its protection and management, and actions needed to secure its future. The IUCN rates each site’s status from “good” to “critical” as a way of tracking its conservation progress over time. The most recent report – the fourth in a series that began in 2014 – was presented at the IUCN World Conservation Congress on Oct. 11, 2025. Overall, the report documents a decline in the conditions of these remarkable places . The proportion of World Heritage sites with a positive conservation outlook – “good” or “good with some concerns” – has dropped to 57% after remaining at 63% in 2014, 2017 and 2020 . In addition, the proportion of sites considered of “significant concern” or “critical” has increased in the last five years from 37% to 43%. Many of those are in Mesoamerica, Africa and South America, as well as the Middle East, North Africa and the Mediterranean. A marine biologist surveys bleached and dead coral on Australia’s Great Barrier Reef. David Gray/AFP via Getty Images Threats from the natural world The report identifies several key challenges affecting heritage sites. The most widespread conservation challenge the report identifies is climate change. Climate-related changes in biological conditions such as ocean acidity, salt concentrations, sediment buildup, droughts, flooding and groundwater flow, and variable temperatures are considered “high” or “very high” threats to 117 of the 271 heritage sites evaluated – 43% of them. One-third of the 50 World Heritage sites that contain glaciers will see those glaciers disappear by 2050, the report projects. Around the world, coral reefs have been, and are still, bleaching – turning white as the colorful organisms that build and inhabit them die off – affecting 30% of the 29 World Heritage-listed coral reef ecosystems. In addition, invasive species are encroaching on World Heritage sites. For example, in Ecuador’s Galápagos Islands, invasive species like rats and feral cats are considered one of the main causes of extinctions, including to the islands’ famous birds. In Australia’s Gondwana Rainforest, the last vestiges of an ancient plant and animal “ living museum ” are retreating due to invading non-native species. Tourists view the face of the Perito Moreno Glacier in Los Glaciares National Park, Argentina. Romina Cruz/picture alliance via Getty Images Threats from people Additional human pressures are also endangering these unique areas. Threats to these sites from the outside include logging and mining in the region, developing nearby land, diverting natural water flows, and polluting the air, water and land. Roughly two-thirds of the sites studied face at least some danger from human activities happening outside the sites’ formal boundaries. In addition, the report says heritage sites need more financial support to be better able to respond to key threats. It finds that most lack consistent, long-term funding for staff salaries, ecosystem monitoring, and continued maintenance of protection programs . Chronic underfunding is the primary barrier to effective ecosystem management. Funding typically comes from organizations such as the World Heritage Fund or the Global Environment Facility , an organization made up of 186 member countries, institutions, nongovernmental organizations, and the private sector that funds environmental projects worldwide. The IUCN report warns that even effective initiatives may struggle in the long term without stronger regional, national and global support. That could include efforts like the Okavango’s Community Management for Protected Areas Conservation program, which connects rural communities and conservationists to support both people and nature. Members of the Lion Intervention Brigade conduct an anti-poaching patrol at Niokolo-Koba National Park, Senegal. AP Photo/Annika Hammerschlag What is missing from the 2025 report? There is good news, though. Targeted local action, such as anti-poaching efforts and local community involvement, have improved conditions at four sites in West and Central Africa, shifting their status from “critical” to “significant concern.” There is more to know about these sites and how they are faring. As a community-based conservation scholar, I recognize that while the major drivers of ecological decline can be gleaned from published research, specific causes of that decline are best learned on the ground. The outlook provides critical environmental trends, but it could be strengthened by including specifics based on quantitative, community-based monitoring, such as wildlife population surveys by local experts. For instance, at a conference I attended in 2024, a frog biologist from Botswana observed that, before her work, the previous frog study in that part of the delta was in 1980. While critical local and Indigenous knowledge is recognized in the report, it is largely excluded from assessments, both because weaving it with conventional scientific analysis is difficult or because communities may choose to protect certain knowledge. The Okavango Delta is one of many World Heritage sites, living landscapes rich with local cultural value and global significance. Like many remote heritage sites outside Europe and North America , there is a lot that remains unknown about biodiversity in the Okavango. The report acknowledges that recognizing the relationship between people and the environment would also improve future assessments. Overall, it offers a clear picture of global conservation trends while also acknowledging local realities and successes: for the heritage sites across the planet, conservation succeeds when people and nature thrive together.",https://theconversation.com/natural-world-heritage-sites-under-growing-threat-but-bright-spots-remain-266548,Society,theconversation.com,Jessica Beaudette,https://images.theconversation.com/files/695704/original/file-20251010-56-y1hr8r.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&rect=0%2C691%2C4548%2C2274&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop,2025-10-11T10:32:09+00:00,91a09ed47f507e4749dfe2b5501502bd8ff8b01d
defcf35cd503,María Corina Machado’s peace prize follows Nobel tradition of awarding recipients for complex reasons,"democracy, latin america, maría corina machado, nicolás maduro, nobel peace prize, trump administration, venezuela, venezuelan opposition","Few can doubt the courage María Corina Machado has shown in fighting for a return to democracy in Venezuela. The 58-year-old politician and activist is the undisputed leader of the opposition to Nicolás Maduro – a man widely seen as a dictator who has taken Venezuela down the path of repression, human rights violations and increasing poverty since becoming president in 2013. Maduro is widely believed to have lost the 2024 presidential election to rival Edmundo González , a candidate substituting Machado, yet still claimed victory. Machado has been in hiding since the fraudulent vote . And her courage in having participated in an unfair contest and in exposing Maduro’s fraud by publishing the true vote tallies on the internet, surely made Machado stand out to the Nobel committee. Indeed, in making Machado the 2025 recipient of the Nobel Peace Prize , organizers stated they were recognizing her “tireless work promoting democratic rights for the people of Venezuela and for her struggle to achieve a just and peaceful transition from dictatorship to democracy.” But as a scholar of Venezuela’s political process , I know that is only part of the story. Machado is in many ways a controversial pick, less a peace activist than a political operator willing to use some of the trade’s dark arts for the greater democratic good. Joining a controversial list of laureates Of course, many Nobel Peace Prize awards generate controversy . It has often been bestowed on great politicians over activists. And sometimes the prize’s winners can have complex pasts and very non-peaceful resumes. Past recipients include Henry Kissinger, who as U.S. secretary of state and Richard Nixon’s security adviser was responsible for the illegal bombing of Cambodia , supporting Indonesia’s brutal invasion of East Timor and propping up dictators in Latin America, among many other morally dubious actions. Similarly, former Palestinian Liberation Organization leader Yasser Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin were both awarded the prize, in 1994 and 1978 respectively, despite their past association with violent activities in the Middle East. Yasser Arafat, Henry Kissinger and Yitzhak Rabin – all Nobel Peace Prize laureates. Duclos/Merillon/Gamma-Rapho via Getty Images The Nobel Committee often seems to use these awards not to celebrate past achievements but to affect the future course of events. The nods to Begin and Arafat were, in this way, used for encouragement of the Middle East peace process. In fact, sometimes, the peace prize is seemingly bestowed as a sign of approval for a break from the past. Barack Obama won his in 2009 despite only being nine months into his presidency. It was taken by many as a rejection of the previous presidency of George W. Bush, rather than recognition of Obama’s limited achievements at that time. In 2016, Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize just days after his peace plan was rejected in a referendum. In that instance, the committee seemed to want to give his efforts a push just after a major setback. Democratic path or dark arts? So what should be made of the Nobel Peace Prize committee’s decision to recognize opposition to Maduro now? Certainly Machado’s profile is ascendant. In her political career, she has participated in elections – winning a seat in the National Assembly in 2010 – but boycotted many more. She also boycotted negotiation processes, suggesting instead that foreign intervention was the only way to remove Maduro. In 2023 she returned to the electoral path and steadfastly mobilized the Venezuelan population for opposition primaries and presidential elections, even after her candidacy was disqualified by the government-controlled electoral authority, and innumerable other obstacles were put in her path. The campaign included spearheading caravans and events across the country at significant personal risk. However, much of her fight since then has been via less-democratic means. Machado has shunned local and regional elections suggesting there was no sense in participating until the government honored the results of the 2024 presidential election. She has also again sought international intervention to remove Maduro. Over the past year she has aggressively promoted the discredited theory that Maduro is in control of the Tren de Aragua gang and is using it to invade the United States – a narrative gladly accepted and repurposed by U.S. President Donald Trump. In addition to being the expressed motivation for a U.S. military buildup off the coasts of Venezuela, this theory has also been the central justification cited by the Trump administration for using the Alien Enemies Act to deport, without due process, 238 Venezuelan men to a horrific prison in El Salvador. Nicolas Maduro continues to loom large and rule Venezuela despite María Corina Machado’s efforts. Jesus Vargas/Getty Images Relations with Trump The Nobel Peace Prize could help unify the Venezuelan opposition movement, which over the past year has begun to fray over differences in strategy , especially with respect to Machado’s return to electoral boycotts. And it will certainly draw more international attention to Venezuelans’ struggle for democracy and could galvanize international stakeholders to push for change. What it will mean in terms of Trump’s relationship to Machado and Venezuela is yet to be seen. Her main connection with the administration is through Secretary of State Marco Rubio , who has aggressively represented her views and is pushing for U.S. military intervention to depose Maduro Awarding Machado the prize could strengthen Trump’s resolve to seek regime change in Venezuela. Or, if he feels snubbed by the Nobel committee after very vocally lobbying to be awarded the peace prize himself, it could be a wedge between the U.S. president and Machado. Machado seems to understand this. After not mentioning him in her first statement after the award was announced, she has since mentioned him multiple times, even dedicating the prize to both the Venezuelan people and Trump . Trump has subsequently called to congratulate her . A game changer? Perhaps not To the degree that the Nobel Peace Prize is not just a model of change but a model for change, the decision to award it to Machado could conceivably affect the nature of Venezuela’s struggle against authoritarianism, leading her to continue to seek the restoration of democracy with a greater focus on reconciliation and coexistence among all Venezuelans, including the still politically relevant followers of the late Hugo Chávez. Whatever the impact, it probably will not be game-changing. As we have seen with other winners, the initial glow of public recognition is quickly consumed by political conflict. And in Venezuela, there is no easy way to translate this prize into real democratic progress. While Machado and other Venezuelan democrats may have more support than ever among global democrats, Nicolás Maduro controls all of Venezuela’s institutions including the armed forces and the state oil company, which, even when sanctioned, provides substantial resources. Maduro also has forged strategic alliances with China, Russia and Iran . The only way one can imagine the restoration of democracy in Venezuela, with or without military action, is through an extensive process of negotiation, reconciliation, disarmament and justice that could lay the groundwork for coexistence. This Nobel Peace Prize could position Machado for this task.",https://theconversation.com/maria-corina-machados-peace-prize-follows-nobel-tradition-of-awarding-recipients-for-complex-reasons-267268,Society,theconversation.com,David Smilde,https://images.theconversation.com/files/695712/original/file-20251010-56-rnf2wt.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&rect=0%2C87%2C3665%2C1832&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop,2025-10-10T22:53:41+00:00,f747a5c0e0562bee3bfcb0d0ec1979e5261bcb71
6071ed47f256,From artificial atoms to quantum information machines: Inside the 2025 Nobel Prize in physics,"nobel prize, nobel prize 2025, particle physics, physics, quantum information science, quantum mechanics, superconductivity","The 2025 Nobel Prize in physics honors three quantum physicists – John Clarke , Michel H. Devoret and John M. Martinis – for their study of quantum mechanics in a macroscopic electrical circuit. Since the prize announcement, cheers and excitement have surrounded the home institutions of these laureates in Berkeley, Santa Barbara and New Haven. The award of this prestigious prize to pioneering research in quantum physics coincides with the 100th anniversary of the birth of quantum mechanics – a revolutionary scientific theory that forms the foundation of modern physics. Quantum mechanics was originally formulated to explain and predict the perplexing behaviors of atoms, molecules and subatomic particles. It has since paved the way for a wide range of practical applications, including precision measurement , laser technology , medical imaging and, probably the most far-reaching of all, semiconductor electronic devices and computer chips . Yet numerous aspects of the quantum world have long remained mysterious to scientists and engineers. From an experimental point of view, the tiny scale of microscopic particles poses outstanding challenges for studying the subtle laws of quantum mechanics in laboratory settings. The promises of quantum machines Since the closing decades of the past century, researchers around the world have sought to precisely isolate, control and measure individual physical objects, such as single photons and atomic ions , that display quantum behaviors under very specific experimental conditions. These endeavors have given rise to the emerging field of quantum engineering, which aims to utilize the peculiarities of quantum physics for groundbreaking technological innovations. John Clarke, an emeritus professor of physics at the University of California, Berkeley, speaks on Oct. 7, 2025, at a press conference on the campus celebrating his 2025 Nobel Prize in Physics. Karl Mondon/AFP via Getty Images One of the most promising directions is quantum information processing , whose goal is to design and implement machines that can encode, process, transmit and detect information in “strange” quantum manners: For instance, an object can be in a superposition of different states at the same time. Distant objects can manifest quantum entanglement – remote correlations that escape all possible classical interpretation. Compared with their conventional electronics predecessors, quantum information machines could have advantages in specific tasks of computation, simulation, cryptography and sensing. The realization of such quantum machines would require experimenters having access to reliable physical components that can be assembled and controlled on the human scale, yet fully obey quantum mechanics. Counterintuitive as it might sound, can we break the implicit boundaries of the natural world and bring microscopic physical laws into the macroscopic reality? Quantum mechanics in an electrical circuit In 1985, the three Nobel laureates – then working in the same research group at the University of California, Berkeley – provided an affirmative answer to the question above. They were studying electrical circuits made of superconductors . Superconductivity is a special state of matter famous for conducting electrical currents without resistance, due to underlying quantum mechanical interactions of electrons at low temperatures. For the first time, the trio observed distinct quantum behaviors of a macroscopic physical variable. 2025 Nobel laureate Michel Devoret (front) leads a hiking group in the French Alps during the 2019 Les Houches Physics Summer School on ‘Quantum Information Machines.’ Photographed by the author, Zhixin Wang. In a superconductor, two electrons bond together to form a Cooper pair . These electron pairs condense into a macroscopic state, which can be described by a collective phase variable shared by all its microscopic constituents. In this state, trillions or more electrons effectively behave like a single entity, resembling the mass collections of atoms that form everyday objects like pendulums or billiard balls. To observe the quantum mechanical motion of this macroscopic phase variable, the three scientists fabricated a device called the Josephson junction , which consists of two pieces of superconductors separated by an insulator layer thinner than 1/10,000 of a human hair. They discovered that, at sufficiently low temperatures (below −273 degrees Celsius, or −459 degrees Fahrenheit), the phase variable difference across the Josephson junction shows a unique quantum mechanical phenomenon known as quantum tunneling , where an object may escape a barrier without the need to climb over its summit. Furthermore, the team exposed the Josephson junction to microwave electromagnetic radiation whose frequency is close to that of Wi-Fi signals. They measured energy levels of the circuit at discrete, or quantized, values , which are usually present only in microscopic atoms and molecules. The device used in these experiments can thus be referred to as an “artificial atom” – namely, an electrical circuit with atom-like properties, which is at once macroscopic in size, adjustable in design, and quantum mechanical in nature. Implications and outlooks The groundbreaking works by Clarke, Devoret and Martinis have had many profound impacts. On the fundamental level, they suggested that distinct quantum phenomena – once thought to exist only at the microscopic level – can actually manifest at much larger physical scales. In the meantime, the invention of superconducting artificial atoms has opened brand-new avenues toward building useful quantum machines with advanced engineering techniques. Based on these discoveries, researchers – including these Nobel Prize recipients and their research groups – have made significant achievements in constructing prototype quantum computers using superconducting quantum circuits in the decades since. The elementary device unit that makes up these information processors is the superconducting quantum bit , or “qubit” for short. Each superconducting qubit is an artificial atom containing one or more Josephson junctions. Its quantum state can be precisely prepared, manipulated and measured by experimenters. The perfection and integration of superconducting qubits are among the state-of-the-art challenges in quantum information technology. 2025 Nobel laureate John Martinis discusses the roadmap of building a quantum computer at the 2016 Adiabatic Quantum Computing Conference in Los Angeles. The 2025 Nobel Prize for physics recognizes original investigations in the intersection of basic and applied sciences. The prize recipients tested profound quantum mechanical hypotheses through clear and rigorous experimentation. From those artificial atoms have emerged the audacious efforts and rapid progress in building practical quantum information machines. The combination of pure intellectual inquiries and engineering advancement has been shaping this interdisciplinary field since its creation. This Nobel Prize is therefore a tribute to the three inventors of superconducting quantum circuits, whose inquisitive minds, broad visions and adventurous attitudes represent the true scientific spirit and will continue to inspire future generations.",https://theconversation.com/from-artificial-atoms-to-quantum-information-machines-inside-the-2025-nobel-prize-in-physics-266976,Society,theconversation.com,Zhixin Wang,https://images.theconversation.com/files/695251/original/file-20251008-56-4eaa2b.jpeg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&rect=0%2C213%2C2560%2C1280&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop,2025-10-10T18:13:06+00:00,d09d79a9ed49c875999ac3ae8cf7a0cfc879a17c
81c37ca1344e,"Government shutdown hasn’t left US consumers glum about the economy – for now, at least","consumers, government shutdown, us federal reserve, us economy, consumer sentiment, economic data","The ongoing federal shutdown has resulted in a pause on regular government data releases, meaning economic data has been in short supply of late. That has left market-watchers and monetary policymakers somewhat in the dark over key indicators in the U.S. economy. Fortunately, the University of Michigan’s Surveys of Consumers is unaffected by the impasse in Washington and released its preliminary monthly report on Oct. 10, 2025; the final read of the month will be released in two weeks. The Conversation U.S. spoke with Joanne Hsu , the director of the Surveys of Consumers, on what the latest data shows about consumer sentiment – and whether the shutdown has left Americans feeling blue. What is consumer sentiment? Consumer sentiment is something that we at the University of Michigan have measured since 1946 . It looks at American attitudes toward the current state of the economy and the future direction of the economy through questions on personal finances, business conditions and buying conditions for big-ticket items. Over the decades, it has been closely followed by policymakers, business leaders, academic researchers and investors as a leading indicator of the overall state of the economy. When sentiment is on the decline, consumers tend to pull back on spending – and that can lead to a slowdown in the economy. The opposite is also true: High or rising sentiment tends to lead to increased spending and a growing economy. How is the survey compiled? Every month, we interview a random sample of the U.S. population across the 48 contiguous states and the District of Columbia. Around 1,000 or so people take part in it every month, and we include a representative sample across ages, income, education level, demography and geography. People from across all walks of life are asked around 50 questions pertaining to the economy, personal finances, job prospects, inflation expectations and the like. When you aggregate that all together, it gives a useful measure of the health of the U.S. economy. What does the latest survey show? The latest survey shows virtually no change in overall sentiment between September and October. Consumers are not feeling that optimistic at the moment, but generally no worse than they were last month. Pocketbook issues – high prices of goods, inflation and possible weakening in the labor market – are suppressing sentiment. Views of consumers across the country converged earlier in the year when the Trump administration’s tariffs were announced. But since then, higher-wealth and higher-income consumers have reported improved consumer sentiment. It is for lower-income Americans – those not owning stock – that sentiment hasn’t lifted since April. University of Michigan In October, we also saw a slight decline in inflation expectations, but it remains relatively high – midway between where they were around a year ago and the highs of around the time of the tariff announcements in April and May. Has the government shutdown affected consumer sentiment? The government shutdown was in place for around half the time of the latest survey period, which ran from Sept. 23-Oct. 6, 2025. And so far, we are not seeing evidence that it is impacting consumer sentiment one way or another. And that is not super-surprising. It is not that people don’t care about the shutdown, just that it hasn’t affected how they see the economy and their personal finances yet. History shows that federal shutdowns do move the needle a little. In 2019, around 10% of people spontaneously mentioned the then-shutdown in the January survey. We saw a decline in sentiment in that month, but it did improve again the following month. Looking back, we tend to see stronger reaction to shutdowns when there is a debt ceiling crisis attached. In 2013, for example, there was a decline in consumer sentiment coinciding with concerns over the debt ceiling being breached. But it did quickly rebound when the government opened again. Whether or not we see a decline in sentiment because of the current shutdown depends on how long it lasts – and how consumers believe it will impact pocketbook issues, namely prices and job prospects.",https://theconversation.com/government-shutdown-hasnt-left-us-consumers-glum-about-the-economy-for-now-at-least-267264,Society,theconversation.com,Joanne Hsu,https://images.theconversation.com/files/695676/original/file-20251010-56-sudaut.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&rect=0%2C151%2C6000%2C3000&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop,2025-10-10T17:25:40+00:00,e3d86a7cc59e2072454af651e81f287dbbdb1399
123b182b57d6,A white poet and a Sioux doctor fell in love after Wounded Knee – racism and sexism would drive them apart,"biography, books, indigenous americans, indigenous peoples day, interracial marriage, lakota, long reads, native americans, romance, south dakota, wounded knee","Like many star-crossed lovers, Elaine Goodale and Charles Alexander Eastman came from different worlds. Goodale, born in 1863 to a family claiming Puritan roots, grew up on a farm in a remote part of western Massachusetts. In 1858, a baby first named Hakadah, later called Ohíye S’a, who then became widely known as Charles Alexander Eastman for most of his adult life, was born near Redwood Falls, Minnesota. A Wahpeton Santee Dakota, he fled to Manitoba, Canada, with tribal members during the 1862 Dakota War between the U.S. military and several bands of Dakota collectively known as the Santee Sioux. In December 1890, the two unexpectedly met each other while working at the Pine Ridge Agency in the newly declared state of South Dakota. Even more improbably, they fell in love. Just weeks later, booming Hotchkiss rifles 15 miles away signaled the start of the Wounded Knee Massacre . Federal troops ended up killing at least 250 Lakota Sioux men, women and children; the traumatic event, historian David Martínez writes , sparked “the abrupt transformation of Indian nations from geopolitical powers … to symbols of conquest.” It also transformed Goodale and Eastman’s nascent relationship: They resolved to marry and to work together for Native American causes. Wounded Knee, however, would also prove an unfortunate metaphor for their marriage. In the research for my new dual biography, “ Love and Loss After Wounded Knee: A Biography of an Extraordinary Interracial Marriage ,” I dove into letters, photographs and hundreds of newspaper articles documenting this high-profile, late-19th-century relationship. I came to understand that their marriage failed not only because of interpersonal tensions and a clash of values, but also because of some of the ways in which ideas about gender, race and Indigenous identity were rapidly changing in the U.S. From writer to teacher At 13, Goodale started publishing poetry in St. Nicholas Magazine , a popular children’s periodical. Her poems generated attention from the press, in addition to fan mail from notable men of letters, including Henry Wadsworth Longfellow . By the time she was 20, she had published five books. Elaine Goodale Eastman in 1890, when she worked as the Supervisor of Education for the Dakotas. South Dakota Historical Society But because poets without family fortunes needed other means to support themselves – and because women in the late 1800s had few career options – Goodale turned to teaching. She accepted a job at Virginia’s Hampton Institute , a boarding school that was founded to teach newly emancipated Black students. It later became part of the government’s program to assimilate Native Americans. Goodale became convinced that Indigenous children would benefit more from schools in their own communities, rather than at government- or church-run boarding schools. She traveled to the Dakota Territory and opened a day school. She also turned from poetry to prose, documenting her observations of “Indian life and education” in dozens of articles. By the time she came to Pine Ridge Agency, the administrative offices at the Oglala Lakota Indian Reservation, she had been appointed the first supervisor of education for the Dakotas. The ideal ‘assimilated Indian’ Ohíye S’a’s early years were marked by family trauma and U.S. government policies aimed at seizing land and displacing and assimilating Native people. His mother died shortly after he was born, and during the Dakota War it was widely believed that his father and brothers had perished. His grandmother and uncle raised him until his mid-teenage years. Charles Eastman was often praised in the press for his academic accomplishments – and his willingness to assimilate. Wikimedia Commons In 1873, the 15-year-old was surprised to discover that his father was, in fact, alive. Jacob Eastman had taken a European-American name and converted to Christianity. He was convinced that only a formal English-language education could provide a path forward for Native people. At his father’s urging, Ohíye S’a became “Charles Eastman,” and he also converted to Christianity. He attended a series of boarding schools before landing at Dartmouth College and then Boston University Medical School . His white mentors saw Eastman – the only Native person in his class at either institution – as the ideal “assimilated Indian.” His achievements often appeared in newspapers with headlines like “He’s a Winner: Sioux Indian Who Got a Boston University Degree,” an allusion to the fact that “Ohíye S’a” translated to “winner.” It isn’t clear whether Eastman ever thought of himself in that way. But throughout his life, he straddled the world in which he was raised and the one in which he was educated. His first job, as agency physician at Pine Ridge, placed him at the nexus of these two cultures. An unlikely pair, a media sensation After the shots rang out near Wounded Knee Creek, Eastman’s medical education was put to the test. Called into service as a nurse, Goodale also tended the wounded and dying in the makeshift hospital at a nearby church. Six months later, Elaine and Charles were married in New York City in June 1891, much to the consternation of her family. A mass grave for Native Americans killed during the Wounded Knee Massacre. Ullstein Bild/Getty Images The couple’s nuptials appeared in hundreds of newspapers, partially due to the rarity of an interracial marriage in the 19th century. Much of the coverage was rife with racist stereotypes . The Watertown Times in New York proclaimed, “Poetess Marries a Big Injun’”; the San Francisco Examiner ran a front-page story declaring “Fair Bride of An Indian: Elaine Goodale Weds the Red Man of Her Choice.” Sometimes, articles focused on Charles’ educational background, often misrepresenting it by suggesting he had attended Cornell, Harvard or Yale. He was referred to as a “specimen,” with racialized language discussing his physical attributes: “He is of medium height … with all the peculiarities of his people in his features. His eyes are small and glittering, his face and nose are broad and his cheek bones very pronounced,” according to the San Francisco Examiner. This type of media coverage – highlighting the differences between Elaine and Charles’ backgrounds, while pointedly describing Charles in stereotyped ways – would dog them throughout their marriage. Professional travails, personal problems Charles attempted to set up his own medical practice in St. Paul, Minnesota. But white patients proved reluctant to see “an Indian doctor,” while Native patients were hesitant to patronize a physician dispensing unfamiliar medicines. The practice failed. Financial pressures increased over the next decade as Elaine and Charles became parents of six children. They moved frequently: Charles took on a series of jobs, including recruiting for the YMCA, lobbying on behalf of the Santee Sioux, and working as an “outing agent” at the Carlisle Indian Industrial School , which involved finding summer placements for Native students with white families in a further attempt to Americanize them. Because Charles left behind few personal papers, it’s difficult to know if he believed in this program. But it’s easy to see how it could have created an identity crisis of sorts. At other points in his life, Charles seemed to put his Dakota identity front and center. For example, he was one of the co-founders of the Society of American Indians, an organization that worked on behalf of self-determination for Native Americans. He even served as its president in 1918. Meanwhile, his wife remained a staunch believer in assimilation. At Elaine’s urging – and likely, under her editorial stewardship – Charles began publishing stories and then books about his “ Indian Boyhood .” While Elaine continued writing and was able to publish a few books, his literary career took off and hers stalled out.

Wikimedia Commons Even their children weren’t spared from the headlines. An article in the St. Paul Globe wrote, of one of the Eastman children, “… the child had not inherited any of the attractiveness of the mother. It was a veritable old squaw miniature.” In her personal writing, Elaine never acknowledged her children as biracial. The public stereotyping and private dismissal of the Eastman children’s identities were undoubtedly another stressor in an already-stressed marriage. Pictures worth a thousand words After many moves, the Eastmans landed in Amherst, Massachusetts. But Charles did not stay put, embarking upon a vigorous new career on the lecture circuit. He became one of the best-known Native Americans of his era, as well as one of the most photographed. Charles Eastman alternatively posed in Western dress and traditional Sioux regalia. Amherst College Sometimes Charles chose to appear in a Victorian suit and cravat. Other times he posed in traditional Sioux regalia . Often the coverage of his talks focused more on what he was wearing than the content of his lecture. Historian Kiara Vigil suggests that Charles knew that his dress functioned as an advertisement for his work , arguing that his choice of attire was strategic: “Eastman’s ability to dress up as an Indian, or not, enabled him to address diverse audiences and their expectations.” He was away from home more than he was present, further fueling Elaine’s resentment. In personal letters, she described her bitterness at Charles leaving the children and household to her sole care, and her belief that he was reinforcing the gender roles she’d railed against. While she certainly understood that his posing in buckskin and feathered headdress was good marketing, she probably never realized what reclaiming his Indigenous identity meant to Charles; she, too, thought of him as the product of successful assimilation. It all falls apart The personal and professional pressures on the Eastmans continued through the early years of the 20th century. They reached a breaking point after their second daughter , Irene Taluta, died in the 1918 influenza pandemic. The tragic loss of a beloved child continued to unravel an already frayed marriage. Elaine and Charles separated in 1921, though they never formally divorced. I’ve been interested in the Eastmans and their unlikely marriage since I first learned of it years ago. As I pieced together parts of this complex relationship, I became convinced that while their compelling story reveals much about late 19th and early 20th century America, it’s also a story for today. At a time of profoundly unsettling controversies around race, immigration and identity, the marriage of Elaine Goodale and Charles Eastman underscores why it can be so challenging for people from different backgrounds to truly understand each other. But their story – how their mutual commitment to improve life for Native American people brought them together, how their quest to educate the nation about a marginalized people gave them purpose, and the ways in which they melded the personal and the political – also suggests the importance of trying.",https://theconversation.com/a-white-poet-and-a-sioux-doctor-fell-in-love-after-wounded-knee-racism-and-sexism-would-drive-them-apart-263175,Society,theconversation.com,Julie Dobrow,https://images.theconversation.com/files/695422/original/file-20251009-66-rg5jry.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&rect=0%2C212%2C3200%2C1600&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop,2025-10-10T14:23:00+00:00,6589b23bb7090d328641972c47d1d8f5b3a5b673
965790e40328,New president of The Church of Jesus Christ ofLatter-daySaints inherits a global faith far more diverse than many realize,"american christianity, christianity, church of jesus christ of latter-day saints (lds), diversity, mormons, religion and society, religious leaders","The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints has spent the past few weeks in a moment of both mourning and transition. On Sept. 28, 2025, a shooting and arson at a Latter-day Saints meetinghouse in Michigan killed four people and wounded eight more. What’s more, Russell M. Nelson, president of the church, died the day before at age 101. Dallin H. Oaks , the longest-serving of the church’s top leaders, was announced the new president on Oct. 14. Oaks will inherit leadership of a religious institution that is both deeply American and increasingly global – diversity at odds with the way it’s typically represented in mainstream media, from “ The Secret Life of Mormon Wives ” to “The Book of Mormon” Broadway musical . As a cultural anthropologist and ethnographer , I research Latter-day Saints communities across the United States, particularly Latina immigrants and young adults . When presenting my research, I’ve noticed that many people still closely associate the church with Utah, where its headquarters are located. The Latter-day Saints temple in Cochabamba, Bolivia, was dedicated in 2000. Parallelepiped09/Wikimedia Commons , CC BY-SA The church has played a pivotal role in Utah’s history and culture. Today, though, only 42% of its residents are members . The stereotype of Latter-day Saints as mostly white, conservative Americans is just one of many long-standing misconceptions about LDS communities and beliefs. Many people are surprised to learn there are vibrant congregations far from the American West’s “ Mormon Corridor .” There are devout Latter-day Saints everywhere from Ghana and the United Arab Emirates to Russia and mainland China . Global growth Joseph Smith founded The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in upstate New York in 1830 and immediately sent missionaries to preach along the frontier. The first overseas missionaries traveled to England in 1837. Shortly after World War II, church leaders overhauled their missionary approach to increase the number of international missions. This strategy led to growth across the globe , especially in Central America , South America and the Pacific Islands . Today, the church has over 17.5 million members , according to church records. A majority live outside the U.S. , spread across more than 160 countries . One way the church and researchers track this global growth is by construction of new temples .These buildings, used not for weekly worship but special ceremonies like weddings, were once almost exclusively located in the United States. Today, they exist in dozens of countries , from Argentina to Tonga. During Nelson’s presidency, which began in 2018, he announced 200 new temples , more than any of his predecessors. Temples are a physical and symbolic representation of the church’s commitment to being a global religion, although cultural tensions remain. Two missionaries for The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints walk through the Missionary Training Center in Provo, Utah, in 2008. AP Photo/George Frey Among U.S. members, demographics are also shifting. Seventy-two percent of American members are white, down from 85% in 2007, according to the Pew Research Center . Growing numbers of Latinos – 12% of U.S. members – have played a significant role sustaining congregations across the country. There are congregations in every U.S. state, including the small community of Grand Blanc, Michigan, site of the tragic shooting . Suspect Thomas Jacob Sanford , who was fatally shot by police, had gone on a recent tirade against Latter-day Saints during a conversation with a local political candidate. In the following days, an American member of the church raised hundreds of thousands of dollars for Sanford’s family. Growing pains Despite the church’s diversity, its institutional foundations remain firmly rooted in the United States. The top leadership bodies are still composed almost entirely of white men , and most are American-born. As the church continues to grow, questions arise about how well the norms of a Utah-based church fit the realities of members in Manila or Mexico City, Bangalore or Berlin. How much room is there, even in U.S. congregations, for local cultural expressions of faith? Latino Latter-day Saints and members in Latin America, for example, have faced pushback against cultural traditions that were seen as distinctly “not LDS,” such as making altars and giving offerings during Dia de los Muertos . In 2021, the church launched a Spanish-language campaign using Day of the Dead imagery to increase interest among Latinos. Many members were happy to see this representation. Still, some women I spoke with said that an emphasis on whiteness and American nationalism, as well as anti-immigrant rhetoric they’d heard from other members, deterred them from fully celebrating their cultures. People attend the twice-annual conference of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints on April 6, 2024, in Salt Lake City. AP Photo/Rick Bowmer Even aesthetic details, like musical styles, often reflect a distinctly American model. The standardized hymnal, for example, contains patriotic songs like “America the Beautiful.” This emphasis on American culture can feel especially out of sync in places in countries with high membership rates that have histories of U.S. military or political interventions. Expectations about clothing and physical appearance, too, have prompted questions about representation, belonging and authority. It was only in 2024, for instance, that the church offered members in humid areas sleeveless versions of the sacred garments Latter-day Saints wear under clothing as a reminder of their faith. Historically, the church viewed tattoos as taboo – a violation of the sanctity of the body . Many parts of the world have thousands of years of sacred tattooing traditions – including Oceania, which has high rates of church membership . Change ahead? Among many challenges, the next president of the church will navigate how to lead a global church from its American headquarters – a church that continues to be misunderstood and stereotyped, sometimes to the point of violence. The temple in Laie, Hawaii, opened in the early 1900s, making it one of the church’s oldest. Kaveh/Wikimedia Commons , CC BY-SA The number of Latter-day Saints continues to grow in many parts of the world, but this growth brings a greater need for cultural sensitivity. The church, historically very uniform in its efforts to standardize Latter-day Saints history, art and teachings, is finding that harder to maintain when congregations span dozens of countries, languages, customs and histories. Organizing the church like a corporation, with a top-down decision-making process, can also make it difficult to address painful racial histories and the needs of marginalized groups, like LGBTQ+ members .

17c48f01a7ed,Trump is cutting funding to universities with large Hispanic student populations – here’s what to know,"affirmative action, college students, education funding, federal funding, higher ed attainment, higher education, hispanic students, latino students, trump administration, us department of education, us latinos, us higher education, future of higher ed","The Trump administration is trying to eliminate diversity, equity and inclusion programs as part of a broader campaign to end what it calls “ wokeness ” in American education. As part of this rollback, the Justice Department announced in July 2025 that it would no longer “defend ” the federal definition of Hispanic-Serving Institutions, or HSIs. These are colleges where at least 25% of undergraduates identify as Hispanic or Latino. This is more than a legal technicality. It reflects the Justice Department’s position that HSI grants violate constitutional protections, putting millions of federal dollars for these schools at risk. Citing this legal rationale, the Department of Education confirmed in September that it had frozen US$350 million in education grants intended for Minority-Serving Institutions . This includes more than $250 million for HSIs, specifically. The Education Department argues that these programs amount to racial discrimination because they tie federal grants to students’ racial or ethnic backgrounds. This echoes the Supreme Court’s decision in 2023, which narrowed how colleges can consider race and ethnicity in admissions. I serve as the university diversity officer at California State University, Chico, an HSI. I am also an ethnic studies scholar who focuses on equity in higher education. Advocates for HSIs say ending federal funding would hurt already underfunded colleges , particularly those that serve large numbers of first-generation and low-income students. Elisa Castillo is the assistant vice president for Hispanic Serving Institution and Minority Serving Institution initiatives at Salem State University, a newly designated HSI in Salem, Mass. Pat Greenhouse/The Boston Globe via Getty Images What are Hispanic-Serving Institutions? Congress created the HSI designation in 1992, through an amendment to the 1965 Higher Education Act . This amendment authorizes federal grants to help strengthen colleges that enroll large numbers of Hispanic and low-income students, providing more opportunity for those students to succeed and graduate. There are more than 600 federally designated HSIs across the U.S. and Puerto Rico. California is home to the most HSIs, with 167, followed by Texas, Puerto Rico, New York and Illinois. In addition to showing that at least 25% of its student population is Hispanic or Latino, any college or university that wants to qualify as an HSI must also show that at least half of its students come from low-income backgrounds . Becoming an HSI allows colleges and universities to apply for federal funding intended to support underrepresented and low-income students. HSIs vary in size and mission HSIs enroll over 1.5 million Hispanic students , which amounts to over 60% of all Hispanic undergraduates in the U.S. This marks a big increase from the 340,000 Hispanic undergraduates who attended an HSI in 1995. Some of these schools are large public research universities, such as University of California, Riverside; University of California, Santa Barbara; and University of California, Santa Cruz. Others are regional institutions, private colleges and local community colleges. Over the past decade, another kind of Hispanic-Serving Institution has emerged – research-intensive HSIs. These are colleges and universities where at least 25% of the student body is Hispanic and where there is significant research funding and a range of doctoral programs offered. These schools include University of California, Irvine; Florida International University; and the University of Texas at El Paso, among others . Some researchers have debated whether the HSI category has become too broad, grouping schools with vastly different resources, missions and student populations. Despite their differences, many HSIs enroll large numbers of first-generation, low-income and working students, as well as immigrants and transfer students. HSIs also generally operate with fewer financial and academic resources than comparable non-HSI institutions. How HSI funding works Title V grants from the Department of Education are one clear way that HSIs can receive federal funding . These competitive grants are intended to help HSIs expand educational opportunities and institutional capacity to support Hispanic and low-income students. Rather than providing aid directly to students, Title V grants are used to offer faculty training, update classrooms and laboratories, create new degree programs and develop mentorship opportunities for first-generation students. At campuses such as California State University, Chico and University of California, Irvine, Title V grants have given schools the money to create bilingual advising services and maintain data systems. Title V grants form only one part of the broader funding picture for HSIs . Like many colleges, HSIs rely on state funding and tuition revenue. They also compete for other federal grants, including those from the National Science Foundation and the Department of Agriculture. How HSIs help Hispanic students A growing body of research shows that HSIs are crucial in helping more Hispanic and first-generation students attend and graduate college. Some HSIs have received national recognition for using evidence-based practices to help Hispanic students perform better in the classroom. Hispanic students at these schools, which include Arizona State University and California State University, Fullerton, graduate at rates roughly 8 percentage points higher than Hispanic students nationally. Hispanic students at HSIs graduate at rates more than 5 percentage points higher than those at comparable non-HSI colleges, according to similar 2017 findings from the nonprofit Education Trust. There are a few reasons why there is a relatively high graduation rate for Hispanic students at HSIs. Students at HSIs often report feeling a strong sense of belonging and see their own cultures reflected in the curriculum. Many HSI campuses also offer dedicated programs for first-generation students and train faculty to teach and advise with equity and inclusion in mind. At University of California, Irvine, where I helped lead HSI initiatives, Hispanic undergraduate enrollment grew by nearly 150% between 2009 and 2019, from 3,000 students to more than 7,500. During that time, more than 350 faculty and staff completed equity-focused training to strengthen advising and teaching practices that support Hispanic and other underrepresented students. Visitors to California State University, Fullerton take a guided campus tour. Jeff Gritchen/MediaNews Group/Orange County Register via Getty Images What’s at stake for HSIs Hispanic Americans now make up nearly 20% of the U.S. population , and their college enrollment numbers are projected to grow from about 3.7 million in 2020 to 4.5 million by 2030, as overall college enrollment numbers are projected to decline during this time. A national evaluation of Title V projects found that most colleges and universities used these grants to improve student services, develop new academic programs and build community partnerships that help first-generation and low-income students stay enrolled and complete their degrees. As HSI researchers note, graduation rates tell only part of the story. True student success at HSIs depends not just on graduation numbers, but on culturally responsive teaching, inclusive campus climates and equity-minded institutional practices. How policymakers define and fund HSIs will shape not only the future of these institutions but also whether this growing generation of Hispanic students can access, afford and complete college in the years ahead.",https://theconversation.com/trump-is-cutting-funding-to-universities-with-large-hispanic-student-populations-heres-what-to-know-251202,Society,theconversation.com,Joseph Morales,https://images.theconversation.com/files/694907/original/file-20251007-56-lcbwd5.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&rect=0%2C155%2C3599%2C1799&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop,2025-10-10T12:38:34+00:00,6ce488a00744c52d8a53c8fc8af46d0db2254381
5157b65c566b,Political violence: What can happen when First Amendment free speech meets Second Amendment gun rights,"charlie kirk, constitutional democracy, dissent, donald trump, first amendment, free speech, guns, political violence, second amendment, us constitution, us supreme court","The assassination in September 2025 of conservative activist Charlie Kirk has heightened attention on the relationship between political rhetoric and political violence. Even before police had identified a suspect, President Donald Trump blamed the shooting on the “rhetoric” of the “radical left .” The Trump administration has since acted to silence left-leaning speakers and is threatening to intensify its attacks on left-wing political speech. But my decades of studying free speech law have convinced me that suppressing political rhetoric, even through social norms rather than law, undermines the discussion, debate and constructive disagreement essential for a healthy democracy . Gun proliferation complicates the problem by making political violence much easier to carry out. Rise of political violence Political violence – by which I mean any physical attack on people that aims to achieve a political goal – harms democracy by shifting the field of political disagreement from debate to aggression. Under the U.S. constitutional system of limited government and individual rights, political violence by the government – for example, government assaults on anti-government protesters – is among the gravest threats to liberty. But political violence committed by private individuals or groups also corrodes constitutional democracy. In the United States, acts of private political violence against members of government and against ordinary people have both increased dramatically in recent years. Political assassinations are the most vivid form of political violence. The Kirk assassination is only the latest example. An attendee at a candlelight vigil and prayer event for assassinated Turning Point USA Founder Charlie Kirk on Sept. 10, 2025, in Seattle. David Ryder/Getty Images In June 2025, a shooter with a “ hit list” of left-liberal targets assassinated Minnesota Democratic Rep. Melissa Hortman and her husband. In December 2024, a shooter angry about health insurance costs killed United Healthcare CEO Brian Thompson. In July 2024, a shooter wounded Trump at a campaign rally in a failed assassination attempt. Political violence also includes bias-motivated murders. In 2022, a white supremacist murdered 10 Black patrons at a grocery store in Buffalo, N.Y. In 2019, an anti-immigrant racist murdered 23 mostly Latino shoppers at a Wal-Mart in El Paso, Texas. In 2018, an antisemite murdered 11 congregants at a Pittsburgh synagogue . In those incidents and numerous others , extreme political ideas appear to have motivated the attackers. The linkage of extremist speech to lethal violence has prompted calls to legally restrict or punish extremist speech . Political violence, free speech and cultural editing The First Amendment, however, protects extremist speech , including advocacy of violence . Violent rhetoric must actually incite or threaten violence to lose the First Amendment’s shelter. If law cannot curb the sorts of speech that may inspire political violence, what about social norms – widely shared beliefs about what speech is socially acceptable or appropriate? Much speech that the First Amendment protects from government regulation eventually disappears from public discourse. That happens through a process I call “cultural editing”: popular and institutional rejection of outmoded or repellent ideas . For example, no serious medical conference discusses treating hay fever with cocaine , and no respectable political science panel includes Nazis. In a social media post after Charlie Kirk’s killing, President Donald Trump blamed ‘radical left’ rhetoric for political violence. The Trump administration’s blaming of the Kirk assassination on “radical left” rhetoric points toward a deeper level of cultural editing. Trump and other conservatives have not cited speech that advocated violence against Kirk. Instead, some conservative activists, spurred on by Trump administration officials, called for harassing and punishing critics of Kirk’s statements and actions. But such criticisms of Kirk, whatever their merits or lack thereof, fall within the scope of ordinary political debate. Kirk was not a government official, but he had strong influence in the Trump administration . Robust democratic discourse requires space for people to criticize such powerful figures. Large-scale cultural editing of those criticisms, amounting to suppression of left-leaning views, would hurt the public’s ability to discuss and resolve political disagreements. However, Trump and others who push for suppressing harsh political rhetoric might argue that the stakes of verbal attacks have increased . They might say that U.S. political culture can no longer indulge political invective because political violence has become more common. Political violence and guns That argument for suppressing harsh political speech ignores an independent cause of political violence: gun proliferation. Most political violence in the U.S. involves guns . Guns make political violence easier by erasing the distance between extremist ideas and lethal action. Hate or fanaticism can end a life in an instant, hundreds of yards from the victim . The U.S. has by far the highest number of civilian guns and rate of civilian gun ownership in the world. Since 2008, when the Supreme Court declared an individual Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms, annual U.S. gun purchases have increased from about 9 million to about 16 million . Governments often find regulating speech easier , even though less effective, than tackling underlying problems. At times, federal and state governments have addressed political violence by regulating guns . The 1994 federal assault weapons ban exemplifies regulatory efforts to curb overall gun violence. But the Supreme Court’s Second Amendment cases now appear to bar strong gun regulations . People in a democratic society need freedom to make harsh, even extreme political statements with a minimum of cultural editing. The Second Amendment protects access to lethal weapons. This combination of free speech and gun rights makes the growing problem of political violence much harder to solve.",https://theconversation.com/political-violence-what-can-happen-when-first-amendment-free-speech-meets-second-amendment-gun-rights-265223,Society,theconversation.com,Gregory P.

580f4b27efee,"Our engineering team is making versatile, tiny sensors from theNobel-winning‘metal-organicframeworks’","chemistry, detectors, engineering, metal-organic frameworks, nobel prize, nobel prize 2025, nobel prize in chemistry, sensors","When the 2025 Nobel Prize in Chemistry honored Omar Yaghi – the “father of metal-organic frameworks,” or MOFs – along with Susumu Kitagawa and Richard Robson, it celebrated more than the creation of a new class of crystalline materials. It recognized a revolution quietly reshaping how scientists capture, store and sense molecules. These MOFs could allow for sensor technologies that make workplaces, the environment and human bodies safer. What are MOFs, and why do they matter? MOFs are made by linking metal ions – atoms that carry an electrical charge – with organic molecules, the carbon-based building blocks found in most living things. Together they form tiny, sponge-like structures full of microscopic pores . You can imagine them as an atomic-scale scaffold filled with nano-sized rooms, each precisely engineered to host certain molecules like guests. Metal-organic frameworks, such as MOF-5 shown here, have metal components, organic ‘linkers’ and a cavity that can allow in gases. Tony Boehle/Wikimedia Commons , CC BY-SA Because chemists can mix and match different metals and organic linkers, there are thousands of possible MOFs – each with unique properties. Depending on how they’re structured, some have so much internal surface area that a single gram could cover a football field. This sponge-like porosity – meaning lots of tiny holes inside – lets MOFs trap and release gases , store energy-rich fuels like hydrogen, and capture harmful pollutants . MOFs can use a variety of chemicals in their structure, which lets researchers fine-tune how strongly an MOF interacts with specific molecules. These features have already inspired potential uses such as capturing carbon dioxide from the air to reduce greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere, pulling clean water from humid air, and delivering medicines inside the body . Over the past decade, the unique properties of MOFs have also opened new possibilities for sensing and detection . Since 2016, our team of engineers has been developing MOF-based sensors that can detect certain gases and vapors in an environment in real time. These materials’ unique properties are opening new possibilities for sensing in health, safety and environmental monitoring. From a storage material to a sensing material When an MOF takes in gas or liquid molecules, its tiny framework changes ever so slightly: It may change in size, how it bends light, or how it conducts electricity, depending on what and how many molecules it absorbs. By connecting MOFs to devices that can sense changes in light or electricity, researchers can turn these tiny shifts into measurable signals such as light, frequency or voltage. The signals then reveal what chemical is present and how much of it there is. In simple terms, when molecules enter or leave the MOF’s pores, they slightly change how light travels through it or how electricity behaves around it, and those changes become the sensor’s readable output. Our group at Missouri University of Science and Technology has developed several kinds of MOF-based sensor platforms. Across all these platforms, the core idea is the same: MOFs act as selective sponges that temporarily hold certain gas molecules in their tiny cages, and our devices measure the timing and amount of this uptake and release. In one study, we attached a single crystal of a copper-based MOF called HKUST-1 to the smooth, flat end of a cut optical fiber – the same kind of thin glass strand used to carry internet and phone signals. This crystal-fiber combination worked as a tiny device that could measure how light waves interfere with each other. As nearby gas molecules moved into the tiny pores of the MOF crystal, the way it bent and reflected light changed slightly. The optical fiber – connected to a light source and detector – picked up these changes , allowing us to see in real time how many gas molecules the material was taking in. Our probes show not just that gas molecules enter the tiny cages of the MOF, but also how fast they come and go. By measuring both the amount and the speed of adsorption and release, we can tell which molecules are being taken up and in what proportion, when several are present together. This dynamic view helps us see, in real time, how the material selects one target gas over others. It turns adsorption into a measurable, useful signal for sensing and identification. In health care, an MOF can act like a selective sponge for specific breath molecules that indicate real, measurable diseases. For example, an MOF designed to adsorb acetone can capture and concentrate this gas from exhaled breath. Acetone levels rise above normal values in people with diabetic ketoacidosis , allowing the sensor to clearly and quantitatively detect the disease. Prof. Jie Huang and his team at Missouri S&T developed an MOF–based breath sensor, funded by the NIH, that was developed for COVID-19 and can also be employed for detecting disease biomarkers such as acetone and ammonia in exhaled breath. Michael Pierce/Missouri S&T Likewise, an MOF that selectively adsorbs ammonia can concentrate this compound from exhaled breath. Ammonia levels increase above normal values in people with chronic kidney disease, so the sensor can provide a definite indicator of reduced kidney function. Integrating such MOFs into sensor hardware would allow for sensitive, noninvasive screening for these two diseases, based on quantifiable breath markers. Coating a material in a thin layer of MOFs can take hours. But recently, we developed a quick and simple “droplet-drying” method that forms a crystal layer of the copper-based MOF HKUST-1 directly onto the end of an optical fiber in under two minutes. The resulting film, only about 1/20th the width of a human hair, acted as a high-performance gas sensor that detected humidity, ethanol or carbon dioxide in the environment within seconds. We also combined MOFs with a hand-held metal device that can sense changes in microwave signals – a bit like how a radio antenna picks up invisible waves in the air. When gas molecules entered the MOF layer, they slightly changed how the device responded to those waves, allowing it to detect gases with remarkable sensitivity. This sensor made for a low-cost, portable device that could tell one kind of gas molecule apart from another, rather than just detecting that some gas is present. It’s like having a nose that can tell apples from oranges, not just detect that something smells fruity. Our research suggests that MOF sensors within compact, energy-efficient devices can pick out specific molecules – even when only trace amounts are present in the air. The pores of an MOF can be designed to concentrate specific target molecules. All molecules smaller than the window to an MOF cage will get into the cage. So, we design the sensors so that the molecules we are interested in sensing will reside in the cages longer. The huge internal surface area created by these pores makes them incredibly responsive. Even just a few trapped molecules can trigger a clear signal. These sensors also work at room temperature and our research suggests they are more precise and adaptable than many traditional chemical sensors. Toward real-world impact The main challenges lie in improving MOFs’ long-term durability and environmental resistance. Many frameworks degrade under humidity or heat , though some research groups are looking into how to make them more stable . When combined with machine-learning algorithms, these sensors can learn to recognize patterns from several gases at once, rather than detecting just one chemical at a time – much like how a human nose can tell different smells apart. This capability could even extend to human breath monitoring , where subtle changes in exhaled gases provide early clues to diseases such as diabetes, lung infections or cancer. Researchers are working to embed MOFs into flexible films , printed circuits and wireless devices . With these new advances and further research, MOFs could bridge chemistry and engineering one day. As the Nobel Prize recognized, MOFs exemplify how design at the molecular scale can help mitigate problems humans face at a global scale. If researchers can scale up this technology and overcome the challenges, networks of fiber-optic and microwave MOF sensors could one day monitor industrial plants, pipelines and even human breath for unwanted chemicals to improve safety, efficiency and health.",https://theconversation.com/our-engineering-team-is-making-versatile-tiny-sensors-from-the-nobel-winning-metal-organic-frameworks-267103,Society,theconversation.com,Bohong Zhang,https://images.theconversation.com/files/695514/original/file-20251009-56-ju8tur.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&rect=0%2C64%2C1200%2C600&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop,2025-10-10T12:37:10+00:00,d18d17eaea619efed8d4b7044b379da3f062efde
d2579c6d8305,Friendships aren’t just about keeping score – new psychology research looks at why we help our friends when they need it,"emotional support, friends, friendship, maasai, psychology, psychology research, relationships","Despite how natural friendship can feel, people rarely stop to analyze it. How do you know when someone will make a good friend? When is it time to move on from a friendship? Oftentimes, people rely on gut intuitions to answer these kinds of questions. In psychology research, there’s no universally accepted definition of a friend. Traditionally, when psychologists have analyzed friendship, it’s often been through the lens of exchange. How much did that friend do for me? How much did I do for them? The idea is that friendships are transactional, where friends stick around only as long as they are getting at least as much as they are giving in the friendship. But this focus doesn’t capture what feels like the essence of friendship for many people. We and our colleagues think another model for relationships – what we call risk-pooling – better matches what many people experience. In this kind of friendship, no one is keeping track of who did what for whom. Our research over the past decade suggests that this kind of friendship was essential for our ancient ancestors to survive the challenges they encountered. And we feel it’s essential for surviving the challenges of life today, whether navigating personal struggles or dealing with natural disasters. Social exchange theory focuses on whether friends are investing and getting the same amount from the relationship. tim scott/Moment via Getty Images A focus on what friends give you The traditional social exchange theory of friendship views relationships as transactions where people keep a tally of costs and benefits. Building on this framework, researchers have suggested that you approach each friendship with a running list of pluses and minuses to decide whether to maintain the bond. You keep friendships that provide more benefits than costs, and you end those that don’t. The theory holds that this balancing act comes into play when making decisions about what kinds of friendships to pursue and how to treat your friends . It’s even made its way into pop psychology self-help spaces. We contend that the biggest issue with social exchange theory is that it misses the nuances of real-life relationships. Frankly, the theory’s wrong: People often don’t use this cost-to-benefit ratio in their friendships. Less accounting, more supporting Anybody who has seen a friend through tough times – or been the one who was supported – can tell you that keeping track of what a friend does for you isn’t what friendships are about. Friendships are more about companionship, enjoyment and bonding. Sometimes, friendship is about helping just because your friend is in need and you care about their well-being. Social exchange theory would suggest that you’d be better off dropping someone who is going through cancer treatment or a death in the family because they’re not providing as many benefits to you as they could. But real-life experiences with these situations suggest the opposite: These are the times when many people are most likely to support their friends . Our research is consistent with this intuition about the shortcomings of social exchange theory. When we surveyed people about what they want in a friend , they didn’t place a high value on having a friend who is conscientious about paying back any debts – something highly valued from a social exchange perspective. People considered other traits – such as loyalty, reliability, respectfulness and being there in times of need – to be much more important. These qualities that relate to emotional commitment were seen as necessities, while paying back was seen as a luxury that mattered only once the emotional commitment was met. Having friends who will help you when you’re struggling, work with you in the friendship and provide emotional support all ranked higher in importance than having a friend who pays you back. While they might not always be able to provide tangible benefits, friends can show they care in many other ways. Of course, friendship isn’t always positive . Some friends can take advantage by asking too much or neglecting responsibilities they could handle themselves. In those cases, it can be useful to step back and weigh the costs and benefits. Friendship is more than the sum of its parts But how do friendships actually help people survive? That is one question that we investigated as part of The Human Generosity Project , a cross-disciplinary research collaboration. The risk-pooling rather than exchange pattern of friendship is something that we found across societies , from “ kere kere” in Fiji to “ tomor marang” among the Ik in Uganda . People help their friends in times of need without expecting to be paid back. Maasai people cultivate lifelong relationships called osotua partnerships. calm_eyes/iStock via Getty Images Plus The Maasai, an Indigenous group in Kenya and Tanzania who rely on cattle herds to make their living, cultivate friends who help them when they are in need, with no expectation about paying each other back . People ask for help from these special friends, called osotua partners, only when they are in genuine need, and they give if they are asked and able. These partnerships are not about everyday favors – rather, they are about surviving unpredictable, life-altering risks. Osotua relationships are built over a lifetime, passed down across generations and often marked with sacred rituals. When we modeled how these osotua relationships function over time, we found they help people survive when their environments are volatile and when they ask those most likely to be able to help . These relationships lead to higher rates of survival for both partners compared to those built on keeping track of debts . These friends act as social insurance systems for each other, helping each other when needs arise because of unpredictable and uncontrollable events. And we see this in the United States, just as we do in smaller-scale, more remote societies. In one study, we focused on ranchers in southern Arizona and New Mexico embedded in a network of what they call “neighboring.” They don’t expect to be paid back when they help their neighbors with unpredictable challenges such as an accident, injury or illness. We also found this same pattern in an online study of U.S.-based participants. In contrast, people such as the ranchers we studied are more likely to expect to be paid back for help when needs arise because of more predictable challenges such as branding cattle or paying bills . Catastrophic insurance, not tit for tat What all this research suggests is that friendship is less about the exchange of favors and more about being there for each other when unforeseeable disaster strikes. Friendship seems more like an insurance plan designed to kick in when you need it most rather than a system of balanced exchange. What lets these partnerships endure is not only generosity, but also restraint and responsibility: Maasai expect their osotua partners to take care of themselves when they can and to ask only when help is truly needed. That balance of care, respect and self-management offers a useful model. In a world of growing uncertainty, cultivating risk-pooling friendships and striving to be a good partner yourself may help you build resilience. Our ancestors survived with the help of this kind of relationship; our future may depend on them too.",https://theconversation.com/friendships-arent-just-about-keeping-score-new-psychology-research-looks-at-why-we-help-our-friends-when-they-need-it-258549,Society,theconversation.com,Athena Aktipis,https://images.theconversation.com/files/695420/original/file-20251009-56-mbh2co.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&rect=0%2C730%2C7913%2C3956&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop,2025-10-10T12:36:44+00:00,a996e17834044c4ceffe2f2b0f61095a0f157584

Treg cells act as the “master regulators” of the immune system – much like conductors leading an orchestra – ensuring that all other immune cells work in harmony. People with too few or defective Treg cells often develop autoimmune diseases , where unchecked immune cells mistakenly attack the body’s own tissues or organs. Yet when Treg cells become too numerous, people can become more susceptible to cancer and infections . For this reason, Treg cells are often described as a double-edged sword. Treg cells also control internal revolt in the form of an overactive immune response by other immune cells that can trigger allergies and autoimmune diseases such as arthritis , lupus and multiple sclerosis – diseases that develop when Treg cells are defective in either number, function or both. The well-established functions of Treg cells in autoimmune diseases, cancer and infections have recently been complemented by research unraveling how environmental factors influence these cells and modulate the immune response. We are a husband-wife team of immunologists who study how environmental factors such as chemicals, diet and gut bacteria affect Treg cells and the overall functioning of the immune system . While our study dating back to 1984 found that certain environmental contaminants induce T cells that suppress the immune system , further study on such cells was hampered by an inability in the field at large to isolate and characterize these cells. The discoveries honored by this year’s Nobel Prize transformed how researchers understand the immune system. One of the three Nobel Prize-winning researchers, Mary E. Brunkow, responds emotionally as she receives the news of the prize. AP Photo/Lindsey Wasson The interplay of environmental factors The environment plays a profound role in regulating the development, maintenance and functions of Treg cells . Some examples of environmental factors include chemical pollutants found in the air and water, microbes, sunlight, diet and medications. Rather than being a single, static population, Treg cells are highly adaptable . They integrate a variety of environmental cues to either suppress or manage immune responses. They accomplish this by producing key molecules such as FoxP3 that send a signal to other immune cells to stop mounting an aggressive immune response. Certain toxic chemicals can increase the number or activity of Treg cells . One of the best-known examples is a group of long-lasting pollutants called dioxins that accumulate in fatty tissues through consumption of contaminated meat, dairy and fish . They are produced from burning waste as well as chemical manufacturing and forest fires. The most toxic dioxin, 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin, or TCDD, is a known human carcinogen . Researchers have linked exposure to this chemical to various health problems, including cancer and reproductive and developmental issues . Research shows that dioxins activate Treg cells through a sensor known as the aryl hydrocarbon receptor . This constitutes one of the mechanisms through which certain environmental chemicals promote cancer by enhancing Treg activity and suppressing the anti-cancer immune response. Air pollution, such as diesel exhaust, can have the opposite effect, impairing Treg cell function and contributing to inflammatory diseases such as asthma . This may occur through damage to the FoxP3 gene . Regulatory T cells, or Treg cells, are one of at least five major types of T cells. ttsz/iStock via Getty Images Plus How diet interacts with Treg cells Diet also plays a powerful role in regulating Treg cells. Compounds known as indoles, found in vegetables from the cabbage family such as broccoli, cabbage and cauliflower, can activate Treg cells and help prevent gut inflammation . These compounds also work by stimulating the aryl hydrocarbon receptor, which boosts Treg numbers and activity. Another way diet can influence Treg cells is through the regulation of the microbes that live in the gut . The gut has trillions of microbial residents, both benefical and harmful . Previous research found that Treg cells in the gut play a crucial role in maintaining gut homeostasis – the dynamic balance between microbiota and immune cells found in the gut. Any disturbance leading to loss of Treg cell function can lead to hyperactivation of other immune cells in the gut. This can trigger inflammation in which the immune cells destroy the lining of the intestine, leading to conditions such as inflammatory bowel disease . Other naturally occurring substances – such as naringenin , a chemical abundant in citrus fruits, and epigallocatechin-3-gallate , a compound found in green tea – also activate the aryl hydrocarbon receptor and promote Treg development. A fiber-rich diet supports the growth of beneficial gut bacteria. This bacteria ferments fiber into short-chain fatty acids that enhance Treg cell function and help maintain gut health. Probiotic bacteria also increases Treg cell populations, thereby reducing inflammation. In addition, dietary tryptophan – an amino acid found in foods such as poultry, eggs, tofu and seeds – is metabolized into compounds that activate the aryl hydrocarbon receptor , further boosting Treg cell activity and protecting against gut inflammation. By contrast, a Western diet high in fat, sugar and processed foods disrupts the balance of gut bacteria . This, in turn, reduces the population of microbes that support Treg cells and promotes a more inflammatory environment in the gut. Keeping Treg cells in harmony Scientists like us and many others are working to understand the processes involved in maintaining the delicate balance of Treg cells that are influenced by all of these outside factors. The goal is to learn how Treg cells and other immune cells can be kept in equilibrium – strong enough to defend against infections and cancer yet restrained enough to prevent autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. The profound environmental influence on Treg cell development and function makes understanding these interactions crucial for defining the fine line between health and disease.",https://theconversation.com/how-pollution-and-the-microbiome-interact-with-tregs-the-immune-system-regulators-whose-discovery-was-honored-with-the-nobel-prize-266865,Society,theconversation.com,Mitzi Nagarkatti,https://images.theconversation.com/files/695469/original/file-20251009-66-nxlyba.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&rect=0%2C0%2C4237%2C2118&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop,2025-10-10T12:36:08+00:00,320ba8c6a2462b03eff3eb9d7b547f372659facc
2a403fc828d6,Flu season has arrived – and so have updated flu vaccines,"centers for disease control and prevention (cdc), cold weather, flu season, flu strains, flu vaccines, influenza, public health, vaccination, vaccines","As the autumn’s cool weather settles in, so does flu season – bringing with it the familiar experiences of sniffles, fever and cough. Every year, influenza – the flu – affects millions of people. Most will experience the infection as a mild to moderate illness – but for some, it can be severe, potentially resulting in hospitalization and even death. While the start of flu season may feel routine, it’s important to remember that the virus changes every year, making annual vaccination an important part of staying healthy . What to expect this flu season Public health experts are closely watching how this year’s flu season unfolds. Early reports suggest that the U.S. may see a moderate level of flu cases , partly because last year’s flu activity was high and it’s uncommon to have two severe flu seasons in a row. However, the U.S. also uses data from the Southern Hemisphere’s earlier flu season, which lasts from April to October, to help predict what the season might look like. There, the flu season has been more severe than in years past . Taken together, that means there could be a significant number of flu cases in the U.S., particularly among children, older adults and those with chronic health conditions . Each year, the flu vaccine is updated to best match the strains of influenza expected to circulate. Because flu viruses mutate frequently , the effectiveness of the flu vaccine can vary each year. However, even when the match between the seasonal flu and the vaccine that is designed around it isn’t perfect, vaccination remains the best protection against severe illness . In the U.S., all flu vaccines for the 2025-2026 season will be trivalent – which means they are formulated to protect against the three main groups of influenza virus strains. These are an A (H1N1) virus, an A (H3N2) virus and a B/Victoria virus. The flu vaccine protects against severe illness from an influenza infection. Jacob Wackerhausen/iStock via Getty Images Plus Vaccine availability Recent vaccine policy changes have created some confusion, particularly around COVID-19 vaccines . Many people are wondering if getting the flu vaccine has become more complicated. The good news is that flu vaccines remain widely available and accessible. Pharmacies, doctors’ offices, public health clinics and many workplaces are offering the seasonal shot, often at little or no cost. The 2025-2026 flu vaccine is available now. Manufacturers start shipping vaccines doses in July and August to ensure access by September. While public health experts won’t know the exact effectiveness of the flu vaccine until flu season is over, the flu shot usually cuts your chances of needing to see a doctor for the flu by about half. Vaccination helps reduce the severity of illness , the likelihood of hospitalization and the spread of infection within our communities. It’s important to note that you can get the flu shot at the same time as other vaccines , such as the COVID-19 vaccine or the RSV and pneumonia vaccines for older adults, without compromising effectiveness. If you’re unsure which vaccines are right for you, your health care provider or pharmacist can help you decide based on your age and health status. Who should get the flu shot The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that everyone 6 months and older receive the flu vaccine each year , with rare exceptions. That aligns with guidelines from other organizations, such as the American Association of Pediatrics . The flu vaccine is especially important for: • Adults 65 and older • Children under 5 – and particularly those under 2 • Pregnant people • People with chronic conditions such as asthma, diabetes or heart disease • Health care workers and caregivers Even if you’re healthy and rarely get sick, getting vaccinated protects not only you but also those around you who may be more vulnerable. Practical prevention tips In addition to vaccination, everyday actions help reduce the spread of flu and other respiratory viruses: • Wash your hands frequently with soap and water. • Cover your coughs and sneezes. • Stay home if you’re feeling unwell. • Consider wearing a mask in crowded indoor spaces during peak flu activity, particularly if you have a cough. Even though flu season is part of life, serious illness doesn’t have to be. By staying informed, getting vaccinated and practicing healthy habits, everyone can play a role in keeping their communities safe and healthy. If you haven’t gotten your flu shot yet, now’s the time to protect yourself, and those you care for, this flu season.",https://theconversation.com/flu-season-has-arrived-and-so-have-updated-flu-vaccines-267058,Society,theconversation.com,Libby Richards,https://images.theconversation.com/files/695489/original/file-20251009-56-q9jfrl.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&rect=0%2C602%2C7218%2C3609&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop,2025-10-10T12:35:28+00:00,b33ea072e9b6aa92a8fcfc2a69b039fc50ad4bec
47cbc51ada3f,Can you really be addicted to food? Researchers are uncovering convincing similarities to drug addiction,"addiction, diet, food, food addiction, food science, nutrition, processed food, sugar, ultra-processed food","People often joke that their favorite snack is “like crack” or call themselves “chocoholics” in jest. But can someone really be addicted to food in the same way they could be hooked on substances such as alcohol or nicotine? As an addiction psychiatrist and researcher with experience in treating eating disorders and obesity, I have been following the research in this field for the past few decades. I have written a textbook on food addiction, obesity and overeating disorders , and, more recently, a self-help book for people who have intense cravings and obsessions for some foods . While there is still some debate among psychologists and scientists, a consensus is emerging that food addiction is a real phenomenon . Hundreds of studies have confirmed that certain foods – often those that are high in sugar and ultraprocessed – affect the brains and behavior of certain people similarly to other addictive substances such as nicotine . Still, many questions remain about which foods are addictive, which people are most susceptible to this addiction and why. There are also questions as to how this condition compares to other substance addictions and whether the same treatments could work for patients struggling with any kind of addiction. How does addiction work? The neurobiological mechanisms of addiction have been mapped out through decades of laboratory-based research using neuroimaging and cognitive neuroscience approaches. Studies show that preexisting genetic and environmental factors set the stage for developing an addiction . Regularly consuming an addictive substance then causes a rewiring of several important brain systems , leading the person to crave more and more of it. This rewiring takes place in three key brain networks that correspond to key functional domains , often referred to as the reward system , the stress response system and the system in charge of executive control . First, using an addictive substance causes the release of a chemical messenger called dopamine in the reward network, which makes the user feel good. Dopamine release also facilitates a neurobiological process called conditioning , which is basically a neural learning process that gives rise to habit formation. As a result of the conditioning process, sensory cues associated with the substance start to have increasing influence over decision-making and behavior , often leading to a craving. For instance, because of conditioning, the sight of a needle can drive a person to set aside their commitment to quit using an injectable drug and return to it. Second, continued use of an addictive substance over time affects the brain’s emotional or stress response network. The user’s body and mind build up a tolerance, meaning they need increasing amounts of the substance to feel its effect. The neurochemicals involved in this process are different than those mediating habit formation and include a chemical messenger called noradrenaline and internally produced opioids such as endorphins. If they quit using the substance, they experience symptoms of withdrawal , which can range from irritability and nausea to paranoia and seizures. At that point, negative reinforcement kicks in . This is the process by which a person keeps going back to a substance because they’ve learned that using the substance doesn’t just feel good, but it also relieves negative emotions. During withdrawal from a substance, people feel profound emotional discomfort, including sadness and irritability. Negative reinforcement is why someone who is trying to quit smoking, for instance, will be at highest risk of relapse in the week just after stopping and during times of stress, because in the past they’d normally turn to cigarettes for relief. Third, overuse of most addictive substances progressively damages the brain’s executive control network, the prefrontal cortex , and other key parts of the brain involved in impulse control and self-regulation . Over time, the damage to these areas makes it more and more difficult for the user to control their behavior around these substances. This is why it is so hard for long-term users of many addictive substances to quit. Scientists have learned more about what’s happening in a person’s brain when they become addicted to a substance. What evidence is there that food is addictive? Many studies over the past 25 years have shown that high-sugar and other highly pleasurable foods – often foods that are ultraprocessed – act on these brain networks in ways that are similar to other addictive substances . The resulting changes in the brain fuel further craving for and overuse of the substance – in this case, highly rewarding food. Clinical studies have demonstrated that people with an addictive relationship to food demonstrate the hallmark signs of a substance use disorder . Studies also indicate that for some people, cravings for highly palatable foods go well beyond just a normal hankering for a snack and are, in fact, signs of addictive behavior. One study found that cues associated with highly pleasurable foods activate the reward centers in the brain, and the degree of activation predicts weight gain . In other words, the more power the food cue has to capture a person’s attention, the more likely they are to succumb to cravings for it. Multiple studies have also found that suddenly ending a diet that’s high in sugar can cause withdrawal , similar to when people quit opioids or nicotine . Excessive exposure to high-sugar foods has also been found to reduce cognitive function and cause damage to the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus , the parts of the brain that mediate executive control and memory. In another study, when obese people were exposed to food and told to resist their craving for it by ignoring it or thinking about something else, their prefrontal cortexes were more active compared with nonobese individuals. This indicates that it was more difficult for the obese group to fight their cravings. Researchers are still working out the best methods to help patients with food addictions develop a healthy relationship with food. Viktar Sarkisian/iStock via Getty Images Plus Finding safe treatments for patients struggling with food Addiction recovery is often centered on the idea that the fastest way to get well is to abstain from the problem substance. But unlike nicotine or narcotics, food is something that all people need to survive, so quitting cold turkey isn’t an option. In addition, eating disorders such as bulimia nervosa and binge-eating disorder often occur alongside addictive eating . Most psychologists and psychiatrists believe these illnesses have their root cause in excessive dietary restriction . For this reason, many eating disorder treatment professionals balk at the idea of labeling some foods as addictive. They are concerned that encouraging abstinence from particular foods could trigger binge eating and extreme dieting to compensate . A way forward But others argue that, with care, integrating food addiction approaches into eating disorders treatment is feasible and could be lifesaving for some. The emerging consensus around this link is moving researchers and those who treat eating disorders to consider food addiction in their treatment models . One such approach might look like the one described to me by addiction psychiatrist and eating disorders specialist Dr. Kim Dennis. In line with traditional eating disorder treatment, nutritionists at her residential clinic strongly discourage their patients from restricting calories. At the same time, in line with traditional addiction treatment, they help their patients to consider significantly reducing or completely abstaining from particular foods to which they have developed an addictive relationship. Additional clinical studies are already being carried out . But going forward, more studies are needed to help clinicians find the most effective treatments for people with an addictive relationship with food. Efforts are underway by groups of psychologists, psychiatrists, neuroscientists and mental health providers to get “ultraprocessed food use disorder,” also known as food addiction, into future editions of diagnostic manuals such as the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders and the World Health Organization’s International Classification of Diseases . Beyond acknowledging what those treating food addiction are already seeing in the field, this would help researchers get funding for additional studies of treating food addiction. With more information about what treatments will work best for whom, those who have these problems will no longer have to suffer in silence, and providers will be better equipped to help them.",https://theconversation.com/can-you-really-be-addicted-to-food-researchers-are-uncovering-convincing-similarities-to-drug-addiction-261727,Society,theconversation.com,Claire Wilcox,https://images.theconversation.com/files/692199/original/file-20250922-56-lhkv8d.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&rect=0%2C518%2C5435%2C2717&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop,2025-10-10T12:34:13+00:00,164e722f46bad9699c04468e95d0ee5c71eb59aa
ecdd8ba69750,"Forwar-wearySyria, potential benefits of security pact with Israel comes with big risks","ahmed al-sharaa, bashar al-assad, benjamin netanyahu, diplomacy, golan heights, israel, middle east, syria, war","On Sept. 21, 2025, a senior U.S official boasted that an Israeli-Syrian security agreement to resolve months of conflict was “99% complete” and would be announced within two weeks. Those two weeks have now passed. And the reality on the ground suggests that the two countries are still far from sealing any deal to end the Israeli military incursions into Syrian territory that have occurred since the fall of Syrian President Bashar Assad in December 2024. Just days after the American official gave his prognosis and as negotiations continued, Israel struck several Syrian targets . Citing negotiation sources, several news outlets reported that the delay in securing a deal was primarily related to Israel’s 11th-hour demand of creating a so-called humanitarian corridor that would link the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights to Sweidah, a city in southern Syria . Israel said the purpose is to protect religious minorities in the Golan Heights and Sweidah. The hitch, after months of U.S.-mediated talks, reflects Syria’s vulnerability in these negotiations. Seeking to move on after year of war, the current Syrian leadership is eager to snuff out remaining internal violence, secure the borders and return to the United Nations-brokered truce with Israel that had been in place for decades. However, concluding a deal with its militarily superior neighbor risks the further fragmentation of Syria and an entrenched violation of its sovereignty. Indeed, as an expert on the Middle East , I believe the talks and the potential last-minute snag point to Israel believing it has the upper hand. Meanwhile for Syria, a desire for security can’t mask what it sees as Israel’s expansionist policy in the region , and concerns that it is using things like a proposed humanitarian corridor as a way to achieve recognition of areas only recently under Israeli control. The fraught history of Syrian-Israeli relations Following the United Nations’ partition of Palestine in 1947 and the proclamation of the state of Israel in 1948, a coalition of five Arab armies , including Syria, declared war on Israel and lost the ensuing conflict. Israeli soldiers stand guard as Syrian Druze people cross back into Syria at the Israeli-Syrian border in the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights town of Majdal Shams. AP Photo/Leo Correa As a result, Syria was forced to sign an armistice agreement with Israel on July 20, 1949. Yet de facto peace never lasted long. The two countries squared off in repeated conflicts in the next 25 years, including the Six-Day War in 1967 that launched Israel’s still-ongoing occupation of Syria’s Golan Heights . In 1974, the U.N. brokered the Agreement on Disengagement between Israeli and Syrian forces. While not a peace agreement, the pact served to codify a ceasefire and created a buffer zone between the two countries monitored by U.N. observers. For 50 years, that status quo held uneasily , as subsequent peace efforts failed . The conflict was effectively frozen, punctuated by occasional flare-ups of violence. Entering the post-Assad era The fall of Assad and his goverment in December 2024 suddenly injected a new dose of uncertainty into Israel-Syria relations. As rebel-turned interim President Ahmed al-Sharaa worked to consolidate power and vowed to restore peace and stability for his war-torn country, Israel went on the offensive. Shortly after the collapse of the Assad government, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu declared the 1974 Disengagement Agreement “ void until order is restored in Syria .” As a result, and in violation of the agreement, Israel occupied the demilitarized zone in the Golan Heights and expanded its control inside Syria. For months, Israel has conducted a campaign of airstrikes across Syria , repeatedly bombing Syrian military positions, including near the presidential palace in Damascus. Israel says it is doing so to stop weapon transfers from Iran and to protect its borders and ensure its security. At the same time, it has pressed the U.S. to keep Syria weak and divided , in part due to Netanyahu’s and his far-right coalition’s hostility to an Islamist-governed neighbor. The U.S., at the urging of allies like Saudi Arabia which are close with the Sharaa government, recently lifted sanctions on Syria. For months, officials of the Trump administration have likewise mediated talks and pushed Israel and Syria to conclude an agreement to stop Israel’s seizures and air campaign. For his part, Sharaa and his negotiators have continually pressed for a halt to Israeli incursions and a return to the 1974 disengagement agreement and the de facto borders it established, describing it as a “necessity.” Hints of common ground on Hezbollah and Iran Aside from Syria’s immediate desire and chief priority to end all hostilities on its territory, there are some potential benefits to a new arrangement with Israel from both countries’ perspective. Before its fall, the Assad government was close to Hezbollah and the Islamic Republic of Iran. Hezbollah , a Lebanese Shia Islamist political party and paramilitary group funded by Iran, supported Assad and played a major role in Syria’s civil war . Furthermore, under Assad’s government, Syria served as a land bridge between Iran and Lebanon through which Hezbollah fighters transported their military equipment, money and drugs . Under Sharaa, Syria’s central government is now closely allied to the Arab Gulf countries that have long been Iran’s regional rivals. In strengthening its security, Syria will no longer serve as Hezbollah-Iran meeting point, which will subsequently benefit Israel. For Syria, it will also stabilize the country against Iranian interference. The risk of Syria’s further fragmentation The risks of a deal with Israel from Syria’s standpoint, however, are significant. In defending its incursions into Syria, Israel has pointed to both the security threat it says Syria poses to Israel and also the situation of minority groups in Syria, where sectarian violence has risen against communities like the Christian Orthodox and the Druze . Israel has floated a number of plans for how it intends to retain a heavy footprint in Syria beyond the occupation of the Golan Heights and the 1974 Agreement of Disengagement. One option on the table is an extension of the historical buffer zone and splitting Syria into autonomous zones, in which Sweidah province would be a demilitarized buffer zone between Israel and Syria. With the most recent idea of a humanitarian corridor couched in the language of protecting Syrian minorities, Israel could be seeking a wider area under more explicit control. From the Syrian perspective, all of the above are backdoor ways by Israel to cement post-Assad military actions beyond the scope of the 1974 truce. As such, agreement to a security pact on Israeli terms would mean jeopardizing or shrinking Syria’s sovereignty and territorial integrity. Syrian protesters gather in front of Damascus Citadel to denounce Israel’s attacks on the Gaza Strip and to oppose any potential agreement that would lead to normalization of relations with Israel. Hasan Belal/Anadolu via Getty Images The Syrian leadership’s challenge going forward After years of war and fragmentation, most Syrians will take any cessation of hostilities with Israel as a welcome development – but not at any cost. Many Syrians are opposed to further fragmentation of the country . And considering the ongoing killing and displacement of Palestinians in Gaza – described recently by a U.N. body as genocide – and Syria’s historic commitment to pan-Arabism, many Syrians will likely be skeptical if a security deal with Israel means a de facto recognition of the land and sovereignty Israel has acquired since December 2024. That points to the major dilemma underpinning Sharaa’s position. Syria is in a vulnerable place and is not in position to negotiate from strength, especially as Sharaa tries to open Syria to the Western world, boost its economy and bring back the civil war refugees from neighboring countries. Seeking to consolidate his government’s hold on power and end the presence of a foreign military, Sharaa likely sees a security agreement as in his immediate interest. While such a pact may bring some stability to Syria and the region, it could also codify Israel’s nearly unchallenged regional power.",https://theconversation.com/for-war-weary-syria-potential-benefits-of-security-pact-with-israel-comes-with-big-risks-265785,Society,theconversation.com,Mireille Rebeiz,https://images.theconversation.com/files/695106/original/file-20251008-66-lfz8kc.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&rect=0%2C30%2C1024%2C512&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop,2025-10-09T17:54:38+00:00,7e92758813fd2f4dae7556e6290e9c1618b5dadf
aeedf9c83add,A Denver MD has spent 2 decades working with hospitalized patients experiencing homelessness − here’s what she fears and what gives her hope,"colorado, denver, doctors, emergency, health, homelessness, hospital, housing, housing first, local, partnerships, safety net, scientists at work, unhoused people","On a recent early fall morning, hope was in short supply. My first patient was a regular. Mr. D was a man in his 50s with diabetes. He had been living on Denver’s streets for most of the past five years, two of them with a walker in tow. Without stable housing and reliable access to insulin, he’d come to the hospital that morning with another limb-threatening infection. I examined the telltale ulceration on the sole of his foot. It had progressed to the underlying bone and would require another amputation. This time he would be dependent on a wheelchair. I asked him about his prospects for housing. He shook his head and said, “Doc, I just keep falling through the cracks.” Mr. D is one of the 10,774 people who experienced homelessness on a single night in 2025 across metro Denver, according to a count conducted by the Metro Denver Homeless Initiative and partner organizations. Of these, 35% were experiencing a chronic form of homelessness. Each year, homeless service organizations count how many people are experiencing homelessness on one night in January. The count helps service providers and government entities understand the trends and needs of people experiencing homelessness. Joe Amon/Denver Post via Getty Images As an internal medicine physician whose focus is caring for hospitalized patients, my experience suggests that this count is too low. People in hospitals and other institutional settings the day of the survey are not reflected in these numbers. Others are hard to spot, staying out of sight on couches or in creek beds, or hiding in plain sight while they serve our food or fix our roads. For these reasons, point-in-time counts underestimate the true prevalence of homelessness in the city. I work at Denver Health , the region’s comprehensive safety net health system, where I’m on the front lines of Denver’s homelessness crisis. My perspectives on this issue have been shaped by nearly two decades of experience caring for some of the city’s most vulnerable patients. I’ve helped create and oversee hospital partnerships that help people like Mr. D find housing. But recent federal actions will only worsen homelessness and weaken the response to it in Colorado and across the nation. Falling through the cracks When people like Mr. D fall through the cracks, my colleagues and I are there to catch them. In 2024, Denver Health served more than 16,000 patients experiencing homelessness who collectively had 78,000 visits to the integrated health system. I’ve watched these cracks widen as Colorado has become one of the least affordable places in the country to live . According to a report by the National Low Income Housing Coalition, in 2025 a Coloradan can work more than 80 hours per week and still be unable to afford a one-bedroom apartment . This means that housing is woefully out of reach for many of my patients. As physicians, we are trained to address the root causes of the diseases we treat. I care for elderly patients who are newly homeless following an eviction, as well as homeless veterans and Lyft drivers who sleep in their vehicles. Though their individual circumstances vary — loss of job or a loved one, an illness or a battle with addiction — the root cause of their homelessness is the same: a lack of affordable and available housing. Because of an increased prevalence of serious health conditions and structural barriers – such as marginalization and discrimination – that prevent equitable access to primary and preventive health care, people experiencing homelessness often rely on hospitals like ours for care. In 2024, roughly 1 in 6 adults admitted to Denver Health’s hospital for an illness or injury were experiencing homelessness, according to internal data. Like Mr. D, many are aging and have cognitive and mobility impairments , along with the frailty characteristic of much older patients. Those living unsheltered suffer preventable harms such as frostbite and heatstroke in Colorado’s climate of extremes. And for many, homelessness is lethal. Last year at least 223 people died while living on Denver’s streets. At Denver Health, homeless adults who are admitted to the hospital stay on average 2.4 days longer than housed patients, translating into 5,400 excess hospital days for Denver residents alone, according to internal data. And without a safe place to recover, they have significantly higher readmission rates. Evidence of the negative impacts of homelessness on health and hospital resources is so compelling that the Center for Medicaid and Medicare Services has recognized homelessness as a comorbid condition . This designation gives homelessness a similar weight to chronic health conditions such as heart disease or diabetes. Seeing the needless suffering brought about by patients’ lack of housing and feeling powerless to stop it also contributes to moral injury among health care providers. Moral injury refers to the psychological and emotional wounds that occur when one witnesses events that violate their moral and ethical beliefs. I’ve certainly recognized these feelings in myself or in colleagues who’ve been at the bedside with me all these years. To me, treating the symptoms of homelessness without addressing the underlying cause feels like treating a gunshot wound with a Band-Aid. Cure for homelessness But unlike many of the conditions I treat, homelessness does have a cure. Simply put, it’s deeply affordable and supportive housing. Evidence shows that Housing First – an approach that prioritizes housing as a critical foundation for engagement in health care services – results in high rates of housing stability and brings down high-cost health care utilization . Roberta Ramirez stays at the Aspen, a noncongregate homelessness shelter in Denver. Hyoung Chang/Denver Post via Getty Images Yet many of the patients I treat, as one of my colleagues likes to say, “will never darken the door of a homeless service agency.” In 2021, only 53% of patients on our health system’s homeless registry were using homeless services in the community. In a cruel irony, the chaos of homelessness that forces people to prioritize survival, combined with health conditions such as physical disabilities, dementia or serious mental illness , often collude to prevent patients from engaging with the very systems that could end their homelessness. Sometimes, like Mr. D, they give up trying. This creates the heartbreaking situations I see in my daily work. Too often the patients with the greatest health care needs and vulnerability are the most underserved. Over time, I’ve learned that improving health inside the hospital walls increasingly means working beyond them to build collaborations to address the myriad ways our systems are failing patients like Mr. D. Housing and health partnerships In Denver some progress has been made. In 2023 Mayor Mike Johnston issued an emergency declaration on homelessness . He subsequently enacted All in Mile High , a citywide strategy to address street homelessness. Through the collaborative efforts of the city and partnering agencies, on Aug. 27,2025, Denver announced a 45% reduction in unsheltered homelessness between January 2023 and January 2025. Denver Health has aided these efforts by investing in strategic partnerships that provide alternatives to discharging hospitalized patients back to the streets . The Renaissance Legacy Lofts and John Parvensky Stout Street Recuperative Care Center in Denver offer medical respite and permanent supportive housing for people experiencing homelessness. Hyoung Chang/Denver Post via Getty Images Since 2023, Denver Health has discharged roughly 700 patients into medical respite beds through a partnership with the Colorado Coalition for the Homeless . The hospital helps fund a portion of beds at the John Parvensky Stout Street Recuperative Care Center to provide patients who are too ill or frail to recover in shelters or on the streets with a safe place and the right support to heal . In another effort to offer housing to at-risk patients, the hospital system sold its former administration building to the Denver Housing Authority , which then redeveloped the property. The hospital now leases 14 apartments that it makes available to provide temporary housing and case management to elderly or disabled patients experiencing homelessness following a hospitalization. Most of the 39 patients who have been housed there have attained more permanent housing, according to internal data. A 9News report on the office building converted into affordable housing in Denver. Denver Health also partners on Denver’s Housing to Health Program , a permanent supportive housing program launched in 2022 that aims to reduce health care expenditures for people experiencing chronic homelessness. A hospital team identifies eligible patients and provides “warm handoffs” to directly connect them with the program’s housing service providers during hospitalizations or emergency room visits. While the evaluation is ongoing, it’s a promising partnership model for how hospitals might collaborate to address homelessness. Impact of federal policies and funding cuts With accompanying investments in proven solutions to homelessness, such partnerships have the potential to deliver better care at lower cost. Actions taken by the federal government in 2025 that criminalize people experiencing homelessness, defund Housing First initiatives and dismantle Medicaid and other essential benefits threaten these partnerships and our progress. These policies will worsen homelessness, and patients will continue to be “housed” in the least appropriate and most expensive way – in the hospital. In addition to harming patients, this trend is not sustainable for safety net hospitals like Denver Health that already provide millions of dollars annually in uncompensated care . As a physician working at the intersection of housing and health, I believe hospitals are key partners in the fight to end homelessness. I’ve observed the hopelessness that homelessness can bring. But I’ve also seen how the right partnerships can transform a routine hospitalization into an unexpected opportunity for meaningful connection that puts patients on the path to housing and health. Now when I see patients like Mr. D, I see possibility rather than another dead end for them. After all, for all their adversity, my patients’ stories are also stories of beauty, strength and resilience. While the “cracks” keep me up at night, their stories, and the partnerships we’ve created, bring me hope at a time when hope seems in short supply.

78aa01c0b229,"Refinery fires, other chemical disasters may no longer get safety investigations","chemical industry, chemicals, chevron, energy, hazardous materials, national transportation safety board, osha, oil industry, risk management, us environmental protection agency","When fire erupted at the Intercontinental Terminals Co. bulk liquid petroleum storage terminal, large plumes of dark smoke billowed into the clear skies over Deer Park, Texas. Despite the efforts of site staff and local firefighters, more than 70 million gallons of petroleum products burned or were otherwise released into the environment over the following three days in March 2019. Even while the fire was still burning, investigations began looking into what had happened and what was still happening. The Environmental Protection Agency tested air and water samples to determine how much pollution was being released – both to determine cleanup efforts and to assess fines . The Occupational Safety and Health Administration reviewed what had happened, but found that with no workers injured, there was no reason to investigate further or impose fines or other penalties on the company. A third federal agency, the Chemical Safety and Hazard Investigation Board, often known as the CSB, got to work figuring out what had gone wrong, without assigning legal or financial responsibility, but rather seeking to learn from this disaster how to prevent future accidents . It’s an approach much like the National Transportation Safety Board takes toward airplane crashes, train derailments and other transportation-related tragedies: document what happened and identify every opportunity to prevent or reduce the chances of it happening again . That deep investigative process reportedly will not happen in the wake of the October 2025 explosion and fire at a Chevron refinery in El Segundo, California, because of the federal government shutdown and lack of funding for the organization. As scholars of chemical disasters , we believe this absence – and the potential for the board to be eliminated entirely under the proposed 2026 federal budget – raises the risk of more, and more serious, chemical disasters, not just in the U.S. but around the world. A fire burns at Intercontinental Terminals Co. in Deer Park, Texas, in March 2019. AP Photo/David J. Phillip Many serious incidents The CSB investigation of that 2019 fire that burned 15 petroleum tanks at the Intercontinental Terminals Co., near the Port of Houston, yielded key recommendations to the company, OSHA and the EPA. They included necessary updates to safety management systems, the need for flammable-gas detectors to identify leaks , and remotely operated emergency shutoff valves so workers could close tanks containing hazardous material without exposing themselves to danger. The company has addressed the first recommendation and is reportedly working on the next two . The board also recommended to the petroleum industry that storage tanks be spaced farther apart so they would be less likely to catch each other on fire – a recommendation that is still under review. And the Texas fire was just one of several disasters the Chemical Safety and Hazard Investigation Board investigated that year. Since its activation in 1998, the board has conducted in-depth investigations of 102 chemical disasters in the chemical and industrial sectors – an average of about four per year. And its reports are regularly used worldwide, including in France, South Korea and China . A U.S. Chemical Safety and Hazard Investigation Board video summarizes the agency’s findings about a March 2019 petrochemical terminal fire in Texas. Creation and goals of the CSB The U.S. Chemical Safety and Hazard Investigation Board was created by Congress in a 1990 amendment to the Clean Air Act, in the wake of several high-profile chemical disasters around the world. Those included the 1976 dioxin release in Seveso, Italy , which caused skin lesions on over 600 people and contaminated nearly 7 square miles of land; the deaths of thousands in Bhopal, India, from the 1984 release of methyl isocyanate from a Union Carbide pesticide plant; and the Chernobyl nuclear plant disaster in 1986 in what was then the Soviet Union. The goal was to prevent similar accidents from occurring on U.S. soil by investigating the causes of incidents and providing recommendations for improvement. Specifically designed to be independent of other organizations and political influence , the CSB cannot be forced to modify its findings by other agencies, branches or political parties, ensuring its impartiality. It has no power to issue regulations, nor any authority to impose fines or other punishments for wrongdoing. Rather, it is a fact-finding, investigative body designed to learn from past disasters and issue voluntary recommendations so chemical companies can improve their equipment and processes to prevent future tragedies. The vast majority of its recommendations are adopted by the industries affected , usually by the investigated company, though sometimes recommendations become industry standards. These recommendations can range from changes in procedure, the addition of safety devices or even overall facility design recommendations. What does the board do? There are several kinds of events companies must report to the federal government, including deaths and releases of particular chemicals , such as chlorine, naphthalene and vinyl chloride. The board reviews those reports and decides on its own which to investigate. When an inquiry is opened, a group of experts who work for the board travel to the incident site to gather evidence to understand not only what happened in the big picture but a detailed view of how events unfolded. After the investigation, the board issues a report detailing what it found and recommending specific changes to the company to reduce the risk of that sequence of events happening again. The board also delivers its information to other federal agencies, such as the EPA and OSHA, which can determine whether changes would be appropriate to federal regulations that apply to all companies in an industry. The board’s value The board had a US$14 million annual budget for 2025, which is a tiny part of the more than $6 trillion the U.S. government spends each year. The current administration’s justification for eliminating the CSB is that its capabilities are duplicated by agencies such as the EPA and OSHA . But the EPA focuses specifically on environmental violations and potential threats to human life. OSHA investigates regulatory violations leading to personal injury. In fact, the CSB has helped the EPA and OSHA evaluate and improve regulations , such as for the open burning of waste explosives , and improved methods of investigating accidental chemical releases and implementing new emergency response rules . The CSB is the only organization that looks into improving processes to prevent future accidents instead of punishing past acts. It’s the difference between investigating who robbed a bank to hold the robbers accountable and improving bank security so another robbery can’t occur.",https://theconversation.com/refinery-fires-other-chemical-disasters-may-no-longer-get-safety-investigations-265546,Society,theconversation.com,Philip Steenstra,https://images.theconversation.com/files/694944/original/file-20251007-56-d601ug.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&rect=0%2C324%2C5272%2C2636&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop,2025-10-09T12:42:51+00:00,9f730328a6fd212492b877f042a49e2983fae8ba
2808aa764f46,"In 1776, Thomas Paine made the best case for fighting kings − and for being skeptical","american revolution, common sense, founders, freedom, monarchy, rule of law, thomas paine, tyrants","In one of his stand-up sets, comedian David Cross rejects all political commentary that tries to answer the question, “What would America’s Founding Fathers think if they were alive today?” For Cross, it is pointless to speculate about the present-day views of men who could not have imagined cotton candy, let alone the machine that makes it. “What’s a machine? What’s a machine???” he screams in their collective voice, recoiling from the sorcery of the state fair. The first time I saw this bit, something odd happened. Having just read the 1776 political pamphlet “Common Sense,” I could hear its author, one of America’s founders , laughing louder than anybody. That would be Thomas Paine, the man credited with turning the American Revolution from a complicated Colonial fracas into a titanic struggle for the soul of liberty itself . If Cross is skeptical that anything 250 years old still holds up, Paine, were he alive today, could probably name one thing: skepticism. Ways of thinking and being do not grow out of the ground; we make them ourselves, then hand them down as best we can. Paine would smile to see his favorite heirloom, the skeptical worldview, still intact. Saying “no” – especially to those in power – is an underrated American pastime , and Paine was its Babe Ruth. If you plan on joining No Kings rallies and have yet to find a slogan for your sign, Paine’s got you covered: “In America, the law is king!” “No King! No Tyranny!” “Monarchy hath poisoned the republic.” I could go on. Because he did. Published in 1776, Thomas Paine’s pamphlet ‘Common Sense’ inveighed against monarchy and hereditary privilege and in favor of independence for the Colonies. Smithsonian National Museum of American History Birth of a revolutionary Where did all this anti-monarchical fire come from? Originally, from a small town in Norfolk, England, in 1737 . Turning from his father’s trade of corset-making, Paine tried his hand at business, met and impressed Benjamin Franklin in London , sailed to America, and there found his true metier as a pamphleteer and radical. Using simple yet incandescent prose, Paine renounced, repudiated and ridiculed at a clip seldom witnessed in print before or since. Hereditary privilege, colonialism , the supernatural : no, no, no. But what Paine made his name lambasting – what he knocked out of the park with almost steroidal force – were kings . All of them, from the figures of ancient legend and Scripture to those who warmed England’s throne during his lifetime. “ Common Sense,” his first major work , was an urgent wake-up call to every light-sleeping lover of liberty within earshot. In that pamphlet, Paine labels kingship “the most prosperous invention the Devil ever set on foot for the promotion of idolatry.” He never minced words; he wanted the right people to choke on them. Thomas Paine quotes in Lexington, Mass., not far from where the American Revolution began. Photo: Joel Abrams , CC BY ‘Simple facts, plain arguments’ Exactly what was Paine’s problem with kings? The same problem you’ll have, “Common Sense” promises, when you examine the evidence. This is partly the secret of Paine’s rhetorical power: It’s hard to imagine any wordsmith demanding more vigorously that you not take his word for it. Paine was a student of history, and history is chock-full of receipts. It shows that abuses of kingly power extend back to the “early ages of monarchy,” when some “principal ruffian” first took power, and “it was very easy, after the lapse of a few generations, to trump up some superstitious tale, conveniently timed … to cram hereditary right down the throats of the vulgar.” Since that time, says Paine, even those fortunate enough to live under benevolent rule have seldom been more than one generation away from yet another dreadful monarch. “One of the strongest NATURAL proofs of the folly of hereditary right in kings, is, that nature disapproves it, otherwise she would not so frequently turn it into ridicule by giving mankind an ASS FOR A LION.” What a tweet this would have made, caps and all. Bring the Paine The only thing Paine liked less than monarchical rule was its enablers, anyone who relinquished their freedom willingly to an aspiring tyrant. This is not only wrong, Paine insists, but against nature, since all of us are created equal. A somewhat puckish-looking Thomas Paine – with the wrong first name and a different spelling of his last one. National Portrait Gallery, Smithsonian Institution But even that’s not the worst part. Those who sacrifice their own freedom on the altar of monarchy also sacrifice that of future generations. Their “unwise, unjust, unnatural compact might (perhaps) in the next succession put them under the government of a rogue or a fool.” Ouch. “Most wise men,” Paine adds, “in their private sentiments, have ever treated hereditary right with contempt; yet it is one of those evils, which when once established is not easily removed; many submit from fear, others from superstition, and the more powerful part shares with the king the plunder of the rest.” Federal worker firings , court settlements , a government shutdown . Paine would loathe how right the U.S. is proving him. Besides criticizing both tradition and manipulative elites for their role in abetting monarchs, Paine’s writing gestures toward a more widely accessible sense of false freedom that comes with getting what you want from whoever happens to wear the crown. This kind of pleasure obscures a painful reality: that the tyrant can strike as well as stroke. The problem of unchecked power is not nearly counterbalanced by any number of indulgences the wielder of that power deigns to bestow. Freedom, Paine insists, is not transactional; whatever price you name, you’re getting fleeced. Or, to put it his way: “O ye that love mankind! Ye that dare oppose, not only the tyranny, but the tyrant, stand forth!”",https://theconversation.com/in-1776-thomas-paine-made-the-best-case-for-fighting-kings-and-for-being-skeptical-266448,Society,theconversation.com,Matthew Redmond,https://images.theconversation.com/files/694886/original/file-20251007-56-n8agt7.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&rect=0%2C50%2C6000%2C3000&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop,2025-10-09T12:42:17+00:00,552b4f81a474fa2619f3d703553df2b4e34aa5f9
37f6d1845efb,Gaza peace plan risks borrowing more from Tony Blair’s failures in the Middle East than his success in Northern Ireland,"benjamin netanyahu, diplomacy, donald trump, gaza, good friday agreement, hamas, israel, israeli-palestinian conflict, middle east, middle east peace plan, middle east peace process, oslo accords, palestine, palestinians, quartet, tony blair, us-middle east","Tony Blair, the man being tapped by U.S. President Donald Trump to help oversee governance of a postwar Gaza, has ample experience with peace processes. As British prime minister, Blair helped usher through the 1998 Good Friday Agreement that did much to end decades of sectarian violence in Northern Ireland. After leaving office, he was also special envoy to the so-called Quartet – a diplomatic effort to find a lasting solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. As Hamas’ Oct. 7, 2023, attack on Israel and the subsequent devastation in Gaza, described recently as genocide by a U.N. body , make clear, that attempt failed. The 20-point peace plan that negotiators are currently discussing in Egypt is light on details. But it outlines the return of the remaining Israeli hostages held by Hamas, the demilitarization of the Gaza Strip and the creation of an international security force to operate on the ground. Notably, the plan does not support the removal of Palestinians from Gaza – something that was present in previous proposals by the Trump administration and which human rights advocates noted amounts to ethnic cleansing . On Oct. 8, 2025, Trump announced that an initial phase involving the exchange of hostages for prisoners and a pause in fighting had been agreed upon. But negotiations continue on sticking points, including the disarming of the militant group. Among other things, the deal also provisions a postwar Gaza governed by an interim “technocratic” and “apolitical” Palestinian committee. This temporary body will be overseen by a “ Board of Peace ” run by Trump himself. Other unspecified members will be added, but the only one mentioned in the proposals is Blair, who according to reports had been in talks with the Trump administration for some time crafting the current peace plan. As a scholar of international relations and Palestinian politics , I fear the proposal contains the same limitations and failings that plagued previous peace plans pushed on Palestinians from outside bodies – including both Blair’s Quartet efforts and the earlier Oslo Accords – and too little of what made Northern Ireland peace stick. A plan rooted in ‘illiberal peace’ The biggest shortcoming critics find with the current plan is that it does nothing to definitively address the right of Palestinians to self-determination and sovereignty – a right enshrined in international law. Nor does the plan include any meaningful Palestinian input, either through legitimate representatives of the Palestinian people or through mechanisms to ensure the Palestinian public’s buy-in. Instead, the new framework is asymmetric, providing the Israeli government many of its political objectives while imposing multiple layers of international control on and vague assurances to the Palestinian people – and only if they comply. As such, the plan continues the trend of what political scientists describe as “illiberal peace” in conflict resolution. In a 2018 paper, scholars described an “illiberal peace ” as one in which “cessation of armed conflict is achieved in ways that are … unashamedly authoritarian.” Such a peace is achieved through “methods that eschew genuine negotiations among parties to the conflict, reject international mediation and constraints on the use of force, disregard calls to address underlying structural causes of conflict, and instead rely on instruments of state coercion and hierarchical structures of power.” Past examples include conflict management in the Kurdish region of Turkey , Chechnya under Russian control and the ethnic cleansing of Nagorno-Karabakh .

Dan Chung/Pool Photo via AP, File The Northern Ireland case study That stands in contrast to peace agreements that have succeeded elsewhere using more inclusive diplomatic frameworks, like in Northern Ireland . For 30-plus years, the territory was engulfed in sectarian violence between the mainly Protestant “loyalists” who wanted to remain part of the U.K. and the Catholic minority that wished to be part of a united, independent Irish republic. To end this armed conflict, the peace process included all relevant parties, including militant groups on all sides. The Northern Ireland peace process also explicitly engaged with the Irish public and offered the people input through two separate referendum votes . People in Northern Ireland voted on whether to support the plan, and people in the Republic of Ireland voted on whether to authorize the Irish state to sign the agreement. This inclusive and democratic process has been able to sustain a cessation of conflict for the past 27 years. While Blair didn’t start the Northern Ireland peace process, his government played a pivotal role, and it was he who memorably noted “ the hand of history ” on the shoulder of those involved in the final days of negotiation. A failed Oslo counterexample The Northern Ireland process stands in direct contrast to many of the failed peace processes attempted in the Middle East, which fall more in line with the “illiberal peace” concept. The most serious push for lasting peace was the Oslo Accords in 1993 , in which the Palestine Liberation Organization accepted Israel’s right to exist, forgoing its claims to much of historic Palestine, in return for Israel’s acknowledgment of the PLO as the legitimate representative of the Palestinian people. That process led to the creation of the Palestinian Authority, which was meant to exercise limited governance on an interim basis, and presidential and parliamentary elections in order to facilitate the input of the Palestinian public. But as many former U.S. officials have since admitted, the accords were asymmetric : They offered Palestinians recognition under the PLO but little pathway to achieve a negotiated solution under conditions of occupation by a far more powerful sovereign country. U.S. President Bill Clinton applauds as Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, left, and Palestine Liberation Organization Chairman Yasser Arafat look on after the signing of the Oslo Accords in 1993. AP Photo/Dennis Cook That peace process fell apart when that asymmetry became clear. The two parties meant very different things when they used the word “state.” The Israel government envisioned some form of limited self-governance for the Palestinians and continued its settlement expansion and military occupation. The Palestinians, on the other hand, envisioned a legitimate state exercising sovereignty. Adding to the problems, Palestinians never had equal negotiating power, and the accords lacked a neutral arbiter in the U.S., the leading mediator. Oslo was intended to be a time-limited process to give negotiators space to resolve outstanding conflict issues. In practice, it served to give long-term diplomatic cover for a status quo in which Israeli governments moved away from a two-state solution while Palestinians became more politically and geographically fragmented under worsening hardship and violence . The Oslo peace process fell apart in the early years of Blair’s government, at the same time as he was helping put the finishing touches on the Good Friday Agreement. The necessity of public buy-in and an inclusive process was evident to many onlookers to the divergent fortunes of both peace processes. Repeating failed lessons in Gaza? In the Israeli-Palestinian context today, Blair risks repeating the mistakes of Oslo. He is poised to sit on an undemocratic international body overseeing a people under a de facto military occupation. As a representative for the Quartet, Tony Blair waves to the media in front of Palestinian officials in Ramallah in the West Bank in 2012. AP Photo/Majdi Mohammed Further, while the Trump plan is reliant on Hamas’ approval, there is no role for the group after the initial stage. In fact, the framework explicitly states that Hamas must be excised from any future discussions of postwar Gaza. Moreover, no other Palestinian group has any direct involvement; Hamas’ main rival Fatah – the party that is in control of the Palestinian Authority in the occupied West Bank – is only briefly mentioned. As for that Palestinian Authority, there is only a vague line about reforming the body. Similarly, there has been no mention of what the Palestinian people might actually want. In this way, the body being proposed recalls the creation of the U.S.-led Coalition Provisional Authority during the invasion of Iraq. That body governed Iraq immediately following the invasion and was criticized for corruption and lack of transparency . The failure of the Iraq War, and the U.K.’s involvement in it, contributed to Blair’s resignation as prime minister in 2007, after which he took on the role of special envoy to the Quartet . Led by the U.N., U.S., EU and Russia, the Quartet was tasked with preserving some form of the two-state solution and implementing economic development plans in Palestinian cities. But it, too, failed to address the changing political realities on the ground as Israeli settlements expanded and the military occupation deepened. The underlying assumption about the Quartet, critics contend, is that it largely ignored the Palestinian right to self-determination and sovereignty; rather, it focused on marginally improving economic conditions and Band-Aid initiatives. The latest U.S.-backed proposal cribs heavily from the approach. Even if it does bring about a welcome respite from the suffering in Gaza in the short term, I believe a durable, mutually agreed upon resolution to the decades-long Israeli-Palestinian conflict requires what Trump’s plan sidelines: Palestinian self-determination. In Northern Ireland, Blair once understood the importance of neutral mediation and the buy-in of all parties to the conflict and the people themselves. The plan he is involved with now appears to be operating with a far different calculus.",https://theconversation.com/gaza-peace-plan-risks-borrowing-more-from-tony-blairs-failures-in-the-middle-east-than-his-success-in-northern-ireland-266742,Society,theconversation.com,Dana El Kurd,https://images.theconversation.com/files/695093/original/file-20251008-66-43dcp7.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&rect=0%2C131%2C1024%2C512&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop,2025-10-09T12:40:47+00:00,20989b218fd1ed8c5f0cc299d1df08b54e06e102
f0e8a58138ca,Metal-organicframeworks:Nobel-winningtiny ‘sponge crystals’ with an astonishing amount of inner space,"carbon capture, chemistry, energy, environment, materials, materials science, nobel prize, nobel prize 2025, nobel prize in chemistry","The 2025 Nobel Prize in chemistry was awarded to Richard Robson, Susumu Kitagawa and Omar Yaghi on Oct. 8, 2025, for the development of metal-organic frameworks, or MOFs , which are tunable crystal structures with extremely high porosity. These are a class of materials that have truly changed the way scientists design and think about matter, inspiring progress in various applications. I’m a MOF scientist and for many of us in the field, this recognition feels both historic and deeply personal. MOFs are not just elegant crystals you’d admire under a microscope; they’re an entire universe of structures, each like a miniature city of tunnels and rooms waiting to be filled. They’ve been my scientific home since I first stepped into research, and they still feel a little bit like magic to me. So, what exactly are MOFs? Metal-organic frameworks are like crystalline scaffolds built from two ingredients: metals that act like connective joints and organic – that is, carbon-based – molecules that behave as bridges to link those joints in a repeating pattern. The result is a highly ordered, porous framework – a kind of molecular architecture that’s both sturdy and full of empty space. Metal-organic frameworks, shown in this model, can trap smaller molecules inside their larger frame. Jonathan Nackstrand/AFP via Getty Images These frameworks are so porous, like sponges with tiny voids, that it’s almost impossible to picture them. One gram of a MOF has so many pores that it can expose as much internal surface area as a soccer field . It’s astonishing that a handful of powder could hide an entire landscape of surface within it. That enormous surface area is one of the unique things that make MOFs so powerful, and it comes from the nanoscale pores – tiny molecular rooms that can trap, separate, transform or transport gases, ions and other molecules. In a way, MOFs are like molecular hotels with countless doors, each programmed to admit only certain guests. Why scientists love them What fascinates me most about metal-organic frameworks is their limitless design space. Just by glancing at the periodic table, every metal could, in principle, serve as a cornerstone, and countless organic molecules can act as bridges connecting them. Even using the same combination can produce entirely different architectures. Chemist Omar Farha compares metal-organic frameworks to Lego sets that you can build and customize. So far, scientists have synthesized over 90,000 MOFs , and computational chemists have predicted hundreds of thousands more. Few material families offer this much versatility. I like to think of MOFs as puzzles or Lego sets, but on the atomic scale. You can replace a single piece, or change its color or shape, and end up with a material that behaves completely differently. Add a new “decoration” – what chemists call a functional group – and the framework suddenly recognizes a new molecule. Stretch the organic bridges, and the same architecture inflates like a balloon, giving what we call isoreticular MOFs . These have the same structure, but bigger pores. In short, MOFs can come in almost every imaginable shape, size and texture. Pushing the boundaries of these materials Beyond their scientific elegance, MOFs are incredibly promising for real-world technologies. Different structures and functionalities lead to different properties and, therefore, different uses. Some MOFs act as molecular sieves, selectively capturing carbon dioxide from industrial exhaust or even directly from air. Others clean polluted water by removing heavy metals, dyes or “ forever chemicals .” Certain MOFs can also carry drugs or imaging agents inside the body for medical applications . In the energy world, they function as electrodes or electrolytes that make batteries safer and more efficient. And many serve as catalysts , accelerating chemical reactions that transform one molecule into another. When I began my Ph.D., my senior colleagues warned me that MOFs might be too delicate – beautiful crystals that would crumble at the first hint of air or moisture. And indeed, some of the early frameworks were fragile curiosities, admired more for their elegance than their endurance. But that perception has changed dramatically. Metal-organic frameworks, like MOF-5 shown here, have metal components, organic ‘linkers’ and a cavity which can allow in gases. Tony Boehle/Wikimedia Commons , CC BY-SA Many MOFs are now remarkably robust. The material I first worked on was a titanium-based metal-organic framework named MIL-125 . It was first reported by Gérard Férey, one of the foundational figures in the MOF and porous framework community who sadly died in 2017. MIL-125 was not only stable, it was practically indestructible in my lab. After synthesizing two grams of it, I stored it on my bench in an open vial and used that same batch for every catalytic experiment throughout my Ph.D. No glovebox, no desiccator – just a jar of yellow powder sitting happily on my bench. That experience taught me something important: While stability can be a legitimate concern, MOFs have grown up. Thanks to smart chemistry, we have materials that can withstand water, heat and repeated use . Since their foundation, researchers around the world have introduced new properties to these materials – from electrical conductivity to light responsiveness – and, crucially, made major progress in scaling up MOF synthesis for industrial applications. Scaling is the key step in bridging the gap between fundamental discovery and large-scale deployment. Researchers are no longer content with studying MOFs in milligrams – we’re often planning for grams, kilograms and beyond. Some startups are turning these advances into real technologies – from storing gases more safely, to pulling clean water straight from desert air , to building more energy-efficient air conditioners . What once felt like science fiction – powders that breathe, trap and transform molecules – is now science fact. Despite these advances, researchers will need to continue improving the stability and scalability of MOFs to fully realize these materials’ potential in the real world. A Nobel moment that honors creativity The 2025 Nobel Prize in chemistry goes beyond honoring three remarkable scientists – it celebrates an entire community: a generation of chemists and engineers who transformed a single idea into a thriving field. The pioneering visions of Richard Robson, Susumu Kitagawa and Omar Yaghi laid the foundations for a vibrant discipline that has grown to encompass everything from gas storage and catalysis to energy and environmental technologies. When I attended my first MOF conference as a second-year Ph.D. student, I listened in awe to many of the pioneers of this field, some of whom are now Nobel laureates. Back then, MOFs felt like magical sponges, and that sense of wonder never left me. It led me to continue my research on conductive MOFs: materials that can carry electricity. Now, in my own research group , we study how these frameworks can make batteries safer and more efficient, and how they can capture waste gases and turn them into useful chemicals using sunlight.

Using quantum systems to perform computation promises to allow researchers to solve problems in areas from chemistry to cryptography that have so many possible solutions that they are beyond the capabilities of even the most powerful nonquantum computers possible. Quantum computing depends on researchers developing practical quantum technologies. Superconducting electrical circuits are a promising technology, but not so long ago it was unclear whether they even showed quantum behavior. The 2025 Nobel Prize in physics was awarded to three scientists for their work demonstrating that quantum effects persist even in large electrical circuits, which has enabled the development of practical quantum technologies. I’m a physicist who studies superconducting circuits for quantum computing and other uses. The work in my field stems from the groundbreaking research the Nobel laureates conducted. Big, cold, quantum In their 1984 and 1985 work, then-Ph.D. student John Martinis , then-postdoctoral researcher Michel Devoret and UC Berkeley professor John Clarke showed that even large electrical circuits could exhibit quantum behavior. They used a circuit made from niobium and lead. When cooled to a few degrees above absolute zero, these metals become superconductors . A superconductor is a material that carries a current without generating any heat. Martinis, Devoret and Clarke showed that in a superconductor, the voltages and currents are governed by quantum mechanics. The circuit has quantized – meaning discrete and indivisible – levels of energy, and it can be in superpositions of multiple states. Any physical system can be described by a state, which tells you everything there is to know about that system. Quantum mechanics shows that a state can have certain quantized values of things that can be measured. An example is energy: A particular system could have energy 1 or energy 2, but nothing in between. At the same time, a quantum system can be in a superposition of more than one state, much like you can add different amounts of red/green/blue to get any color in a pixel of an image. Importantly, the laureates showed that researchers can describe one of these superconducting circuits as if it’s a single quantum particle. This simple behavior is what makes superconducting circuits so useful as a technology. Dilution refrigerators like this chill their contents to near-absolute zero. U.S. Air Force Research Laboratory Today, superconducting circuits are used to study fundamental quantum physics, to simulate other physical systems and to test protocols for ultraprecise sensing. For instance, the Devoret group recently demonstrated a near-ideal microwave amplifier based on a superconducting circuit. Microwave amplifiers are widely used in communications, radar and scientific instruments. The Martinis group has used superconducting circuits to emulate a group of electron-like particles . This type of simulation is a key technique in studying fundamental physics. In my own group, we recently used a superconducting circuit to demonstrate a protocol for measuring a magnetic field more sensitively than standard techniques. Quantum sensors measure physical quantities with extreme precision, from biological activity to gravity anomalies. But by far the biggest application of superconducting circuits is as a platform for quantum computing. Superconducting quantum computers Multiple quantum systems can interact with each other and become entangled , so that they act like a single system. This combination of quantization, superposition and entanglement is what gives quantum computers their power. In quantum computing technology, researchers use a quantum system – a quantum bit or qubit – that can be in only two states. Qubits need to be coherent. This means that if we put it in a particular state, we want it to stay there and not get randomly scrambled to another state. Qubits need to be controllable. This means that researchers should be able to get a qubit to change state as needed and get it to interact with other qubits. And qubits need to be scalable, meaning that we need to make a lot of them. Many technologies show promise, such as arrays of atoms in a vacuum, trapped ions, trapped electrons in seminconductors, and photons controlled by optical circuits. But all technologies make trade-offs, sacrificing coherence, controllability or scalability to improve something else. The simplicity and flexibility of superconducting circuits mean that by changing the design of the circuit, researchers can get almost any qubit behavior we want, and that behavior is easy to predict. This hits the technological sweet spot for quantum computing. More obviously quantum technologies, such as trapped atoms, are so small that they can be hard to control and interact with. Superconducting qubits are big enough to be easy to control, simple enough to be reliable and quantum enough to make the whole thing work. Today, academic research groups like mine develop new types of superconducting qubits, look for ways to make them more coherent, try to improve our control of them, and develop techniques to make them easier to scale up. Companies and government labs take these academic results along with their own basic research and apply them, doing the difficult engineering to create large-scale quantum processors for practical use. Superconductor pioneers Unsurprisingly, the Nobel laureates made and continue to make huge contributions beyond their work in the 1980s. In addition to their academic work, Martinis formerly headed the Google quantum processor effort and now has his own company , while Devoret now assists with the Google effort. Clarke, now retired, also did much of his late-career work on quantum circuits. And they have had major impacts on my career and on so many others. I had the privilege to do a panel discussion with Devoret on May 22, 2025. He made a memorable claim: Picking an academic adviser can be even more of a big deal than picking a spouse, because “you can’t divorce your adviser.” It’s often joked that half the researchers in the field of quantum superconductors can trace an academic lineage to Clarke. I can do it twice: My Ph.D. adviser, Irfan Siddiqi, was advised by Devoret, and Clarke was my secondary adviser. And one of my proudest accomplishments as a grad student was not panicking when Martinis snagged me after I gave a talk to grill me on the details. Today they are honored for their work, and tomorrow I and the other researchers they trained will do our best to continue it.",https://theconversation.com/nobel-prize-in-physics-awarded-for-ultracold-electronics-research-that-launched-a-quantum-technology-266979,Society,theconversation.com,Eli Levenson-Falk,https://images.theconversation.com/files/695204/original/file-20251008-56-mb44vi.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&rect=0%2C0%2C1942%2C971&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop,2025-10-08T19:24:00+00:00,e68c48ffa35d9e2f5ac30ed8e0271945549ce001
6541ee3991e5,"For Trump’s perceived enemies, the process may be the punishment","adam schiff, donald trump, indictment, james comey, letitia james, pam bondi, prosecution, us department of justice, legal fees","Former FBI Director James Comey pleaded not guilty to two criminal charges in a federal court in Alexandria, Virginia, on Oct. 8, 2025. The charges allege that Comey lied to Congress in September 2020 when he stood by earlier testimony that he did not authorize a leak of an FBI investigation involving Hillary Clinton . Numerous legal commentators on both the left and right have argued that Comey’s indictment is little more than the Trump administration seeking vengeance on one of the president’s perceived enemies. They allege that the president has it out for Comey, who investigated Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election and was fired by Trump in 2017. The president’s own words support the idea that the Trump administration is targeting Comey. In a social media post on Sept. 20, 2025, Trump directed Attorney General Pam Bondi to move forward with prosecutions against Comey, Democratic U.S. Sen. Adam Schiff and New York Attorney General Letitia James: “They’re all guilty as hell, but nothing is going to be done. …JUSTICE MUST BE SERVED, NOW!!!” If the case against Comey is exceedingly weak – and little more than a political prosecution – then, in my view as a scholar of the U.S. legal system , it should result in the dismissal of charges by the judge or a not guilty verdict by the jury. But even when an individual is not convicted, the process of defending against charges can itself be a form of punishment , as renowned legal scholar Malcolm Feeley pointed out almost 50 years ago. Here’s how the criminal justice process punishes even innocent people. When you’re prosecuted by the government, it can upend your life. NurPhoto via Getty Images The criminal justice process The criminal justice process is complex . After a grand jury returns an indictment at the request of a prosecutor, the accused appears in court for their arraignment . They are informed of the charges against them and typically enter a plea . During what’s called “ discovery ,” the prosecution and defense investigate the evidence the other side plans to rely on. There are also pretrial motions in which the parties ask judges to dismiss charges and accept or exclude evidence. The defense and prosecution may also meet to discuss a plea bargain , wherein the accused may plead guilty in exchange for a lesser sentence or reduced charges. If there is no plea bargain, then the case moves to trial, which is itself a complicated process . If a defendant is found guilty, they can mount an appeal to higher courts in an attempt to have their conviction overturned. To help navigate this process, criminal defendants typically hire a lawyer. And good lawyers don’t come cheap. Money and time Indigent defendants , who do not have the financial resources to pay their own legal fees, can rely on public defenders paid for by the government. But individuals who can afford to pay for their own lawyer face a substantial financial burden for attorney services and court fees . An experienced criminal defense lawyer can charge more than US$1,000 per hour , with fees quickly adding up. This means that mounting a legal defense can easily cost tens of thousands of dollars. On top of this, it takes a great deal of time to prepare for a criminal case. While lawyers and their staff do much of the legwork for trial preparation, a client works with their attorneys to help formulate a defense. As a result, criminal defendants lose one of the most precious commodities in the world : their time. And this time can come at a tangible cost in the form of lost wages, which harms their day-to-day lives. Put simply, every hour spent preparing for trial is an hour defendants could spend working or enjoying their lives. Patrice Failor, center, wife of former FBI Director James Comey, is embraced by daughters Claire Comey, left, and Maurene Comey at the courthouse in Alexandria, Va., where James Comey was arraigned and pleaded not guilty on Oct. 8, 2025. Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images Stress and embarrassment It’s not pleasant being charged with a crime. The criminal process, which typically lasts months , takes a toll on one’s mental health . This is largely driven by the uncertainty surrounding the outcome of a criminal trial and the possibility of losing one’s freedom if convicted. In addition, there is a social stigma that comes with being accused of a crime. This can result in reputational damage, anxiety and embarrassment. The Trump administration appears to recognize this reality. Several media outlets have reported that FBI leadership had planned a public perp walk for Comey. According to a CBS News report , this was to have included “‘large, beefy’ agents … ‘in full kit,’ including Kevlar vests and exterior wear emblazoned with the FBI logo.” Apparently, the plan was aborted after several FBI supervisors refused to cooperate, viewing it as inappropriate. One agent was disciplined for insubordination after refusing to go along with the plan to embarrass Comey in this way. Not all criminal defendants suffer the same The extent to which criminal defendants experience the criminal justice process as a form of punishment varies from person to person. For high-status people like Comey , lost wages and attorneys’ and court fees may not be that big of a deal. But these costs may be incredibly significant for other people who have been, or are likely to be, targeted by the Trump administration. The high costs of lawyers’ fees are well known to the president. For instance, his political action committee spent millions of dollars on attorneys’ fees in an unsuccessful effort to defend Trump from criminal charges in New York. In addition, people no doubt experience the psychological stress and stigma of a possible criminal conviction differently. But regardless of one’s wealth, the lost time spent preparing a criminal defense is something that cannot be replaced. The recognition that the criminal process is itself a form of punishment is one of the reasons that the Department of Justice has maintained independence from the president. By violating the tradition of staying out of politics, the Justice Department in the Trump administration has opened the door for the president to seek retribution on his perceived political enemies. The mere act of putting them through the criminal process ensures that they suffer, regardless of their guilt or innocence.",https://theconversation.com/for-trumps-perceived-enemies-the-process-may-be-the-punishment-266747,Society,theconversation.com,Paul M.

41d490284e6e,James Comey’s indictment is a trademark tactic of authoritarians,"alexei navalny, authoritarianism, democracy, department of justice, donald trump, ethics, fbi, fbi director, fifth amendment, james comey, nicolás maduro, recep tayyip erdogan, us constitution, us law, viktor orbán, vladimir putin, watergate, white house, authoritarians","Former FBI Director James Comey was indicted by a federal grand jury on Sept. 25, 2025 – only the second time in history an FBI director has faced criminal charges. The indictment came just five days after President Donald Trump took to social media to demand that Comey be prosecuted, and three days after Trump installed a former aide as the prosecutor to bring the case. Legal experts across the political spectrum describe this as an unprecedented political prosecution that breaks fundamental democratic norms and mirrors tactics used by authoritarian leaders worldwide. As a professor of law , I think Comey’s indictment is momentous because it tests a principle that has protected American democracy for 50 years: Presidents should not direct prosecutors to charge their political enemies. When leaders can abuse the justice system to target critics and investigators, the rule of law collapses. An unconstitutional indictment The evidence of political interference in Comey’s indictment is unusually strong. Trump waged an eight-year vendetta against Comey after the FBI investigated Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election . On Sept. 20, Trump posted on Truth Social demanding prosecution: “What about Comey, Adam ‘Shifty’ Schiff, Leticia??? They’re all guilty as hell… We can’t delay any longer… JUSTICE MUST BE SERVED, NOW!!!” After the indictment, Trump called Comey “one of the worst human beings this country has ever been exposed to.” The Fifth Amendment protects against vindictive and selective prosecution. To prove vindictive prosecution, a defendant must show through objective evidence that the prosecutor acted with “genuine animus” and that the defendant would not have been prosecuted except for that hostility. Comey listens to the committee chairman at the beginning of the Senate Intelligence Committee hearing on Capitol Hill on June 8, 2017, in Washington. AP Photo/Alex Brandon As the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit explained in United States v. Wilson in 2001, the government cannot prosecute someone to punish them “for doing what the law plainly allows him to do.” When circumstances create a realistic likelihood of vindictiveness, the burden shifts to the government to justify its conduct. After Comey’s indictment, Jordan Rubin , a former prosecutor in the Manhattan D.A.’s office, stated: “If the Trump administration’s prosecution of James Comey isn’t ‘selective’ and ‘vindictive,’ then those words have lost all meaning.” Additionally, three former White House ethics counsels – Norman Eisen, Richard Painter and Virginia Canter – wrote to Congress after Comey’s indictment, saying that in the U.S. “a president should never order prosecutions of his enemies. That happens in Putin’s Russia, and it has happened in other dictatorships, but not here. Until now.” They concluded: “If the Trump administration can do this, then no American is safe from political prosecution.” Broken judicial norms For 50 years since the Watergate scandal that exposed President Richard Nixon’s abuses of power, American presidents have followed a core principle: They must not interfere in decisions about who gets investigated or charged, especially not for political reasons. The Justice Department’s manual includes the post-Watergate requirement that legal judgments must be “ impartial and insulated from political influence .” The three former ethics counsels emphasized that during their service, they “never once saw” Presidents George W. Bush, Barack Obama or Bill Clinton “suggest that the Department of Justice should prosecute a specific person, much less a political adversary.” Comey was indicted on two counts – one count of making a false statement to Congress and one count of obstruction of a congressional proceeding, both in connection with his testimony before a Senate committee in September 2020. The allegations against Comey were reviewed multiple times. Special counsel John Durham examined them during Trump’s first term . Prosecutors with the U.S. attorney’s office in Washington, D.C., during the Biden administration called Comey to testify before a grand jury about allegedly using his friend Daniel Richman as a conduit to leak information to the press. And career prosecutors in 2025 under former U.S. Attorney Erik Siebert also reviewed the allegations. Everyone declined to charge Comey . The procedural breakdown reveals how fundamentally this case violates norms. Career prosecutors wrote a memo in September 2025 stating they could not establish probable cause to charge Comey. When Siebert refused to proceed, Trump removed him and installed Lindsey Halligan, Trump’s former personal defense attorney . She has no prosecutorial experience. Three days later, Halligan brought the indictment. She signed it alone – no career prosecutors put their names on it, as is usually done. The grand jury rejected one of the three charges prosecutors tried to bring, a rare signal of weak evidence. Comey’s son-in-law, Troy A. Edwards Jr., a federal prosecutor in the same office where Halligan now works, resigned immediately, stating he was leaving “ to uphold my oath to the Constitution .” Comey was arraigned on Oct. 8 and pleaded not guilty. Echoes of authoritarians Prosecuting former law enforcement officials who investigated the country’s leader is not typical of democracies. It is a hallmark tactic of authoritarian rulers seeking to consolidate power. In Turkey, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan arrested his main political rival in March 2025 on corruption charges that critics call politically motivated. Between 2014 and 2020, Erdogan investigated 160,000 Turks for insulting the president and prosecuted 45,000 of them, including a 14-year-old boy . More than 1,400 people were arrested and detained in nationwide protests. Russia under Vladimir Putin provides the starkest example. Opposition leader Alexei Navalny was poisoned by security services, imprisoned on politically motivated charges and ultimately died in prison in 2024. Even the lawyers who defended Navalny faced criminal prosecution. Russian President Vladimir Putin, right, and Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban attend a joint news conference outside Moscow on Feb. 17, 2016. Maxim Shipenkov/Pool Photo via AP In Venezuela, President Nicolás Maduro has systematically arrested opposition leaders and forced critics into exile . Maduro inherited a stacked Supreme Court from his predecessor, Hugo Chávez, that has systematically nullified opposition legislation . The court has also orchestrated takeovers of opposition parties and certified Maduro’s fraudulent 2024 election claim despite opposition evidence showing it won by a 2-to-1 margin. And Hungary’s Viktor Orban created the Sovereignty Protection Office with powers to investigate any organization or person it suspects of receiving foreign support to influence public life or the democratic process. Orban also installed a loyalist chief prosecutor under whose office “numerous high-profile allegations of corruption have been either quietly shelved or investigated perfunctorily before being dropped,” according to EU Today. The pattern is clear: When leaders can use the justice system to protect themselves, whether by prosecuting investigators, refusing to investigate corruption or intimidating the judiciary, democratic institutions erode and the rule of law becomes a tool of political control rather than a constraint on power. What this means for America Legal experts predict Comey will be acquitted – the evidence is weak and the political interference is blatant. But as a scholar of legal ethics, I believe the damage is already done. Trump has shown he can force prosecutors to charge his enemies. Future government officials now face an impossible choice: investigate powerful people, as Comey did, and risk prosecution, or decline to investigate and allow corruption to flourish. Yet there may be a silver lining: When governments break norms this brazenly, they often create legal vulnerabilities. Legal commentator Ed Whelan has pointed out that Halligan’s appointment may violate a 1986 Office of Legal Counsel memo authored by then-Deputy Assistant Attorney General Samuel Alito, which concluded that only one interim U.S. attorney appointment is permitted under the statute. Former interim U.S. Attorney Erik Siebert had already served that term. If Halligan wasn’t validly appointed , the indictment may be legally void. The precedent this case sets affects every American. As the former ethics counsels wrote after Comey’s indictment: “No American should have to go through the experience of being prosecuted under these circumstances, and the rest of us should not have to live in fear that it may also happen to us.”",https://theconversation.com/james-comeys-indictment-is-a-trademark-tactic-of-authoritarians-266214,Society,theconversation.com,Cassandra Burke Robertson,https://images.theconversation.com/files/695154/original/file-20251008-64-wttx2t.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&rect=0%2C250%2C4444%2C2222&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop,2025-10-08T16:29:10+00:00,4a0d81ea3b75d83ca947e2fb094dbf3e8736184d
93afc48767dc,Why higher ed’s AI rush could put corporate interests over public service and independence,"ai and education (spencer), artificial intelligence ethics, artificial intelligence (ai), higher education, public-private partnership","Artificial intelligence technology has begun to transform higher education , raising a new set of profound questions about the role of universities in society. A string of high-profile corporate partnerships reflect how universities are embracing AI technology. The University of Florida began assembling one of the fastest university supercomputers through a collaboration with Nvidia encompassing AI infrastructure, research support and curriculum development . Princeton launched the New Jersey AI Hub with Microsoft, CoreWeave and the state government, which will house AI startups on university-owned land under a Princeton director . Meanwhile, the California State University system partnered with OpenAI to provide ChatGPT Edu to all students and faculty, branding itself as “ the first AI-powered university system in the United States .” As a social scientist who studies educational technology and organizational partnerships, I view these collaborations as part of a decades-long shift toward the “ corporatization” of higher education – where universities have become increasingly market-driven, aligning their priorities, culture and governance structures with industry partners. I see the rise of generative AI as accelerating this trend, which risks undermining higher education’s autonomy and public service mission. Examining the underlying organizational forces that shape the future of higher education can shed light on how AI challenges universities’ traditional principles – and how they might resist corporate influence. The rise of corporate partnerships Over the past 50 years, private sector support for university research has increased tenfold , outpacing overall growth in higher education research spending. A pivotal shift came in 1980, when universities gained the right to retain intellectual property from federally funded research. This made commercialization of university research far easier . Over time, corporate involvement pushed university research toward commercial needs and increasingly exposed universities to the profit motive. But partnerships haven’t just brought in money for universities; they’ve reinforced a shift toward closer alignment with industry . Universities expanded dramatically in the second half of the 20th century to meet companies’ demand for skilled labor , further coupling higher education to market incentives. After decades of growth, however, university enrollment peaked in 2010 , partly due to demographics, and the decline is projected to continue . Meanwhile, competition from training programs offered by tech companies has been growing , and federal funding has been slashed under President Donald Trump . As colleges continue to close at record rates , the imperative to attract tuition dollars and research grants increasingly dictates institutional priorities . I argue that universities risk sidelining research that serves the public interest by looking toward corporate funding and partnerships to fill the gaps. In my view, the shift away from public-good scholarship to monetizable content and services shaped by external industry partners jeopardizes the academic freedom and intellectual stewardship that once anchored the mission of higher education. For example, under financial constraints, university administrators may be inclined to overlook glaring value misalignments between their public mission and the commercial objectives of AI firms. The forces driving universities’ AI initiatives At many universities, AI adoption and the turn toward corporate collaborations are driven by more than economic vulnerabilities. The broad range of partnerships with AI companies across higher education can provide insight into the deeper dynamics at work. Differences in AI partnerships are emerging around long-standing divides between types of institutions . Stanford’s Institute for Human-Centered AI can be interpreted as an attempt to steer global discourse on ethical AI while preserving human-led research as a marker of elite prestige. Meanwhile, AI initiatives at institutions with a strong focus on teaching and accessibility, such as California State University and Arizona State University , appear to prioritize efficiency in learning outcomes and workforce development. The California State University system aims to become the first and largest ‘AI-powered university system,’ motivated in part to prepare students for careers in an AI-driven economy. Myung J. Chun via Getty Images This underscores how AI partnerships are not guided by market incentives alone. Before universities grew into multibillion-dollar businesses , their decision-making was primarily driven by markers of intellectual prestige, such as scholarly excellence and faculty reputation. Universities largely held a monopoly over knowledge production and served as the primary gatekeepers of intellectual legitimacy, until the digital revolution dramatically decentralized access to knowledge and its production . Universities now coexist in – and increasingly compete with – a crowded, complex ecosystem of companies and organizations that produce original research. Generative AI represents a powerful new mode of knowledge production and synthesis, which further threatens to upend traditional forms of scholarship . Confronted with challenges to their authority, universities may attempt to preserve their elite intellectual status by rushing into partnerships with AI companies eager to capture the higher education market . My interpretation is that economic pressures and the pursuit of prestige may be converging to reinforce a technocratic approach to higher education , where university decision-making is primarily guided by performance metrics and corporate-style governance rather than the public interest. A purposeful path forward The evolution of higher education in response to AI has brought long-standing debates about the purpose of universities to the forefront of public discourse . Decades of corporatization has helped fuel widespread “ mission sprawl ” and conflicting institutional goals across higher education. Consistent with organizational theory , ambiguity about universities’ role in society could lead many institutions to become increasingly susceptible to corporate co-optation, political interference and eventual collapse . Although partnerships between universities and corporations can advance research and support students , corporate norms and academic principles are inherently distinct . And at many universities the process through which differences in institutional values are surfaced and reconciled is unclear, especially as AI initiatives have often sidestepped democratic faculty governance . The recent surge in AI partnerships puts in plain view the growing dominance of market forces in higher education. As universities continue to adopt AI technologies, the consequences for intellectual freedom, democratic decision-making and commitment to the public good will become an increasingly pressing question.

The membership roll already includes scores of famous actors like Jamie Lee Curtis, Viola Davis, Whoopi Goldberg, Pedro Pascal, Natalie Portman and Michael Keaton. Successful directors like Spike Lee and Ben Stiller have signed on, along with singer and actress Barbra Streisand and pop star and songwriter Billie Eilish. Fonda, a star who has championed progressive causes since the 1970s , explained when she announced the group’s new edition on Oct. 1, 2025, that the effort isn’t really new. Instead, it marks the relaunch of the Committee for the First Amendment , an organization her father, actor Henry Fonda , had belonged to. The original Committee for the First Amendment was formed in October 1947 at a time when the U.S. government worried that there were communists in Hollywood who were putting left-wing propaganda into the movies. Jane Fonda, here shown attending the 2024 Hollywood Climate Summit at the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, has been a famous activist almost as long as she’s been a leading lady. Kevin Winter/Getty Images Hearings divided Hollywood The attack on Hollywood started when a bipartisan congressional committee held a series of highly publicized hearings in 1947 on what it said was the “communist infiltration of the motion picture industry.” The House Un-American Activities Committee , known as HUAC, invited 23 “friendly” anti-communist witnesses to testify. Ayn Rand , a Russian-born novelist and screenwriter who hated communism, was one of the witnesses. She testified that the 1944 MGM movie “ Song of Russia ” showed clean, well-dressed, happy peasants, which she said was a sanitized, propagandized version of life in the USSR. Another movie that came under suspicion was “It’s a Wonderful Life.” The FBI complained that the 1946 blockbuster , which starred Jimmy Stewart as a broken man who learns the true value of his life, “deliberately maligned the upper classes” with its negative portrayal of Mr. Potter, the town’s richest man. The HUAC hearings continued for a decade and divided Hollywood. The committee’s interrogators demanded that people turn on each other and “name names.” Due to these hearings, as well as an anti-communist publication called Red Channels , hundreds of screenwriters, directors, producers, actors and musicians were fired or blacklisted for having ties to liberal groups. Nine of 10 Hollywood writers, directors and producers, indicted by a Washington grand jury on charges of contempt of Congress, surrender in a group at the U.S. Marshals Service office in Los Angeles on Dec. 10, 1947. AP Photo/Harold Filan Fighting back The HUAC hearings brought Hollywood stars and the flashbulbs of the nation’s press corps to Capitol Hill. Conservative screen idols like Gary Cooper testified that communism wasn’t “on the level.” Friendly witnesses , like Rand and Cooper, were allowed to read prepared statements and to speak for as long as they liked. Such courtesies were not granted to the 10 “unfriendly” witnesses – the suspected communists who became known as the “ Hollywood 10 .” Screenwriter John Howard Lawson was the first of the Hollywood 10 to testify. Lawson, after refusing to answer if he was a communist or not, was shouted down by Rep. J. Parnell Thomas , a New Jersey Republican who served as HUAC chair. After Lawson was removed from the courtroom, HUAC’s chief investigator, Robert Stripling, read detailed evidence of Lawson’s communist affiliations. Prominent Hollywood liberals understood that these hearings were an attack on free speech, free assembly and other rights guaranteed by the First Amendment . Ira Gershwin , the lyricist known for his hit show tunes such as “I Got Rhythm” and “They Can’t Take That Away From Me,” hosted the first gathering of the Committee for the First Amendment at his Beverly Hills mansion. Attendees included Judy Garland, Humphrey Bogart, Lauren Bacall and Gene Kelly. The committee quickly raised US$13,000 – the equivalent of $188,000 today – and chartered an airplane to Washington. Upon their arrival in the capital, they marched and spoke out in support of the Hollywood 10. Next, they produced a radio broadcast, “ Hollywood Fights Back ,” as a defense of the rights of Americans to write, produce, act in and see whatever movies they pleased. The committee released an initial statement with 35 signatories . A few months later, it published a pamphlet with more than 300 additional names supporting the effort. Purging Hollywood If you’ve never heard of that committee, or if you only learned about it recently when the new version made headlines, you’re not alone. The group fizzled out almost as quickly as it had mobilized. Bogart, perhaps its most famous member, soon retracted his support for the Hollywood 10, saying in March 1948 that he regretted his trip to Washington. “ I’m no Communist ,” the “ Casablanca ” star declared in a widely circulated statement. Two crucial developments kneecapped the committee. First, the HUAC cited the Hollywood 10 for contempt of Congress . They were later tried in court and convicted of that crime. They eventually served prison time. Also, studio executives drafted new hiring policies for the movie industry. Later known as the “ Waldorf declaration ” because the meeting took place in the Waldorf-Astoria hotel in Manhattan, the studio heads announced that the Hollywood 10 would be fired and banned from any studio, and that all the studios would agree to fire and ban any known communists. Over the next decade, hundreds more stars and other key players in the entertainment industry were fired, purged and blacklisted in what became known as the blacklist era. I’m a professor of English and film studies , and I’m writing a book about progressive films made during those years . The original committee’s members were mainly leftists and liberals whose careers survived the political pressures to root them out of show business. The Committee for the First Amendment ultimately failed to protect the Hollywood 10 from professional attacks or incarceration, nor did it prevent hundreds of others from being blacklisted. Bad timing But I don’t believe that the original Committee for the First Amendment was destined to fail. The Hollywood 10’s legal strategy, rooted in the First Amendment, reflected the hope that their convictions might be eventually overturned by the Supreme Court. Unluckily, however, Frank Murphy and Wiley Blount Rutledge , two of the court’s most liberal justices, died before the appeal of the first two Hollywood 10 convictions could reach them. After President Harry Truman replaced them, the Supreme Court declined to hear the appeals. Most of the Hollywood 10 served prison sentences between 1950 and 1951. Why bother? Given that the Committee for the First Amendment failed to protect Hollywood from conservative repression in the 1940s and 1950s, why would anyone revive it? One reason is that there are parallels between the blacklist era and today. For example, the Trump administration is trying to get comedians who poke fun at him kicked off the air, as evidenced by talk show host Jimmy Kimmel being temporarily pulled off the air. Hollywood has also seen a surge in labor organizing. Many members of the new Committee for the First Amendment were on the front lines of the screenwriters and actors strikes of 2023 . Finally, this fight is arguably worth waging. Most Americans see the First Amendment as enshrining valuable rights. An October 2025 Marist poll found that 4 in 5 Americans think the U.S. is restricting First Amendment freedoms too much. Americans still debate whether or not it was right to fire and blacklist Hollywood’s suspected communists. While many see the HUAC hearings as a travesty , others defend the House committee and the anti-communist fervor that inspired it. ‘The Pajama Game,’ a hit movie made in the 1950s, featured a fight by workers for higher pay. Resilience and silence Many look at the blacklist era as a time of capitulation by progressives in the face of repression. While there’s some validity to these claims, I’ve found that many progressive filmmakers also banded together, using allegory and other creative techniques to make movies with progressive – sometimes radical – messages. Take “The Pajama Game,” for example. It’s a musical comedy about labor trouble in a pajama factory. While the film is a sexy, frothy romp, on the one hand, the film also casts Doris Day as Babe, a feisty union steward. In “Racing with the Clock,” workers sing about the pressure they feel to speed up the pace of their labor. Scenes include workers organizing a slowdown, sabotaging machinery and going on strike. The last word spoken in the film is “solidarity.” To me, the revival of the Committee for the First Amendment draws attention to the dangers implicit in efforts to muzzle writers, artists and filmmakers. “Silence the artist, and you silence the most articulate voice the people have,” the actress Katharine Hepburn said in May 1947 in a speech written for her by Dalton Trumbo , one of the Hollywood 10. “Destroy culture and you destroy one of the strongest sources of inspiration from which a people can draw strength to fight for a better life.”",https://theconversation.com/jane-fonda-other-stars-revive-the-committee-for-the-first-amendment-a-group-that-emerged-when-the-anti-communist-panic-came-for-hollywood-266751,Society,theconversation.com,Kathy M.

But my research shows it often comes with a catch : Homebuyers who win bidding wars tend to experience a “winner’s curse,” systematically overpaying for their new homes. I’m a real estate economist , and my colleagues and I analyzed nearly 14 million home sales in 30 U.S. states over roughly two decades. We found that people who paid more than the asking price for their homes – a reliable sign of a bidding war – were more likely to default on their mortgages and saw significantly weaker returns. How much weaker? On average, homebuyers who won bidding wars saw annual returns that were about 1.3 percentage points lower than those who didn’t, we found. We specifically looked at “unlevered” returns – basically, the returns you’d get if you bought the home outright with cash, without factoring in a mortgage. Since the typical homeowner in our sample held a property for 6.3 years before selling it, this translates to about an 8.2% overpayment. Bidding-war winners were also 1.9 percentage points likelier to default. Perhaps that loss would be worth it to someone who absolutely loves the property – but we found that homebuyers who purchase after a bidding war are also faster to resell. This suggests their overpayment is based less on enduring affection and more on bidding-war fever. We also found that the effects of the winner’s curse – lower home appreciation and higher default rates – are stronger in places where bidding wars are more common. One example is my hometown of Rochester, New York, which has become a bidding-war hot spot in recent years. Who bears the brunt? Lower-income, Black and Hispanic buyers are more likely to overpay in bidding wars, we found, making them more likely to suffer from the winner’s curse. This suggests that hot housing markets can worsen inequality. Why it matters While housing is the largest single form of wealth Americans own, past research on the winner’s curse mostly dealt with land auctions and company mergers – not the nation’s roughly 76 million owner-occupied, single-family homes . Our work is the first to show the direct evidence of the winner’s curse in residential housing markets. This matters now because the housing market is cooling. Those who bought in the post-pandemic housing market and listed their homes in 2025 are already facing the risk of selling at a loss . Because this risk falls disproportionately on Black and Hispanic homebuyers, it could further widen the wealth gap. By one measure, foreclosures are up 18% year over year . If the brunt of these losses falls on lower-income or otherwise vulnerable homeowners, the result could be an increase in housing insecurity and homelessness. The good news is that the winner’s curse may be preventable. Better resources to prepare first-time homebuyers and comprehensive financial education related to mortgages and debt could help. What still isn’t known It’s possible more transparent bidding processes – or even formal auction systems for popular homes – could better inform prospective buyers and help them stave off the temptation of overpayment. Should the U.S. require real estate brokers or banks to caution their clients to think twice before going above the asking price? Or would that be unfair to sellers? Experimental research on these points would be useful. Finally, our research focuses on the U.S. housing market. Whether the winner’s curse afflicts buyers in other countries remains an open question. The Research Brief is a short take on interesting academic work.",https://theconversation.com/winning-a-bidding-war-isnt-always-a-win-research-on-14-million-home-sales-shows-266723,Society,theconversation.com,Soon Hyeok Choi,https://images.theconversation.com/files/694396/original/file-20251003-66-ltw5ps.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&rect=0%2C306%2C3929%2C1964&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop,2025-10-08T12:26:11+00:00,07587de8e31393ce151a23f88e2de527598cd903
a820e802f483,Geothermal energy has huge potential to generate clean power – including from used oil and gas wells,"earth, energy, fracking, geothermal, geothermal energy, ground source heat pump, heat pumps, hydraulic fracturing, international energy agency, oil and gas, power generation, solar pv, wells, wind power, clean power, gas wells, oil wells","As energy use rises and the planet warms, you might have dreamed of an energy source that works 24/7, rain or shine, quietly powering homes, industries and even entire cities without the ups and downs of solar or wind – and with little contribution to climate change . The promise of new engineering techniques for geothermal energy – heat from the Earth itself – has attracted rising levels of investment to this reliable, low-emission power source that can provide continuous electricity almost anywhere on the planet. That includes ways to harness geothermal energy from idle or abandoned oil and gas wells. In the first quarter of 2025, North American geothermal installations attracted US$1.7 billion in public funding – compared with $2 billion for all of 2024 , which itself was a significant increase from previous years, according to an industry analysis from consulting firm Wood Mackenzie. As an exploration geophysicist and energy engineer , I’ve studied geothermal systems’ resource potential and operational trade-offs firsthand. From the investment and technological advances I’m seeing, I believe geothermal energy is poised to become a significant contributor to the energy mix in the U.S. and around the world, especially when integrated with other renewable sources. A May 2025 assessment by the U.S. Geological Survey found that geothermal sources just in the Great Basin, a region that encompasses Nevada and parts of neighboring states, have the potential to meet as much as 10% of the electricity demand of the whole nation – and even more as technology to harness geothermal energy advances. And the International Energy Agency estimates that by 2050, geothermal energy could provide as much as 15% of the world’s electricity needs . For generations, Maori people in New Zealand, and other people elsewhere around the world, have made use of the Earth’s heat, as in hot springs, where these people are cooking food in the hot water. Wolfgang Kaehler/LightRocket via Getty Images Why geothermal energy is unique Geothermal energy taps into heat beneath the Earth’s surface to generate electricity or provide direct heating. Unlike solar or wind, it never stops. It runs around the clock, providing consistent, reliable power with closed-loop water systems and few emissions. Geothermal is capable of providing significant quantities of energy. For instance, Fervo Energy’s Cape Station project in Utah is reportedly on track to deliver 100 megawatts of baseload, carbon-free geothermal power by 2026. That’s less than the amount of power generated by the average coal plant in the U.S., but more than the average natural gas plant produces. But the project, estimated to cost $1.1 billion , is not complete. When complete in 2028 , the station is projected to deliver 500 megawatts of electricity . That amount is 100 megawatts more than its original goal without additional drilling, thanks to various technical improvements since the project broke ground. And geothermal energy is becoming economically competitive . By 2035, according to the International Energy Agency, technical advances could mean energy from enhanced geothermal systems could cost as little as $50 per megawatt-hour , a price competitive with other renewable sources . Types of geothermal energy There are several ways to get energy from deep within the Earth. Hydrothermal systems tap into underground hot water and steam to generate electricity. These resources are concentrated in geologically active areas where heat, water and permeable rock naturally coincide. In the U.S., that’s generally California, Nevada and Utah. Internationally, most hydrothermal energy is in Iceland and the Philippines. Some hydrothermal facilities, such as Larderello in Italy , have operated for over a century , proving the technology’s long-term viability. Others in New Zealand and the U.S. have been running since the late 1950s and early 1960s. A drilling rig sits outside a home in White Plains, N.Y., where a geothermal heat pump is being installed. AP Photo/Julia Nikhinson Enhanced geothermal systems effectively create electricity-generating hydrothermal processes just about anywhere on the planet. In places where there is not enough water in the ground or where the rock is too dense to move heat naturally, these installations drill deep holes and inject fluid into the hot rocks, creating new fractures and opening existing ones, much like hydraulic fracturing for oil and gas production. A system like this uses more than one well. In one, it pumps cold water down, which collects heat from the rocks and then is pumped back up through another well, where the heat drives turbines. In recent years, academic and corporate research has dramatically improved drilling speed and lowered costs . Ground source heat pumps do not require drilling holes as deep, but instead take advantage of the fact that the Earth’s temperature is relatively stable just below the surface, even just 6 or 8 feet down (1.8 to 2.4 meters) – and it’s hotter hundreds of feet lower . These systems don’t generate electricity but rather circulate fluid in underground pipes, exchanging heat with the soil, extracting warmth from the ground in winter and transferring warmth to the ground in summer. These systems are similar but more efficient than air-source heat pumps, sometimes called minisplits , which are becoming widespread across the U.S. for heating and cooling. Geothermal heat pump systems can serve individual homes, commercial buildings and even neighborhood or business developments . Direct-use applications also don’t generate electricity but rather use the geothermal heat directly. Farmers heat greenhouses and dry crops ; aquaculture facilities maintain optimal water temperatures; industrial operations use the heat to dehydrate food, cure concrete or other energy-intensive processes. Worldwide, these applications now deliver over 100,000 megawatts of thermal capacity . Some geothermal fluids contain valuable minerals; lithium concentrations in the groundwater of California’s Salton Sea region could potentially supply battery manufacturers . Federal judges are reviewing a proposal to do just that, as well as legal challenges to it . Researchers are finding new ways to use geothermal resources, too. Some are using underground rock formations to store energy as heat when consumer demand is low and use it to produce electricity when demand rises. Some geothermal power stations can adjust their output to meet demand , rather than running continuously at maximum capacity. Geothermal sources are also making other renewable-energy projects more effective. Pairing geothermal energy with solar and wind resources and battery storage are increasing the reliability of above-ground renewable power in Texas , among other places. And geothermal energy can power clean hydrogen production as well as energy-intensive efforts to physically remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere , as is happening in Iceland . Enhanced geothermal systems can be built almost anywhere and can take advantage of existing wells to save the time and money of drilling new holes deep into the ground. U.S. Geological Survey Geothermal potential in the US and worldwide Currently, the U.S. has about 3.9 gigawatts of installed geothermal capacity , mostly in the West. That’s about 0.4% of current U.S. energy production , but the amount of available energy is much larger , according to federal and international engineering assessments. And converting abandoned oil and gas wells for enhanced geothermal systems could significantly increase the amount of energy available and its geographic spread. One example is happening in Beaver County, in the southwestern part of Utah. Once a struggling rural community , it now hosts multiple geothermal plants that are being developed to both demonstrate the potential and to supply electricity to customers as far away as California . Those projects include repurposing idle oil or gas wells , which is relatively straightforward: Engineers identify wells that reach deep, hot rock formations and circulate water or another fluid in a closed loop to capture heat to generate electricity or provide direct heating. This method does not require drilling new wells, which significantly reduces setup costs and environmental disruption and accelerates deployment . There are as many as 4 million abandoned oil and gas wells across the U.S., some of which could shift from being fossil fuel infrastructure into opportunities for clean energy . Challenges and trade-offs Geothermal energy is not without technical, environmental and economic hurdles. Drilling is expensive , and conventional systems need specific geological conditions . Enhanced systems, using hydraulic fracturing, risk causing earthquakes . Overall emissions are low from geothermal systems, though the systems can release hydrogen sulfide, a corrosive gas that is toxic to humans and can contribute to respiratory irritation . But modern geothermal plants use abatement systems that can capture up to 99.9% of hydrogen sulfide before it enters the atmosphere. And the systems do use water, though closed-loop systems can minimize consumption. Building geothermal power stations does require significant investment , but its ability to deliver energy over the long term can offset many of these costs . Projects like those undertaken by Fervo Energy show that government subsidies are no longer necessary for a project to get funded, built and begin generating energy. Despite its challenges, geothermal energy’s reliability, low emissions and scalability make it a vital complement to solar and wind – and a cornerstone of a stable, low-carbon energy future.",https://theconversation.com/geothermal-energy-has-huge-potential-to-generate-clean-power-including-from-used-oil-and-gas-wells-266555,Society,theconversation.com,Moones Alamooti,https://images.theconversation.com/files/694654/original/file-20251006-56-n1yweb.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&rect=0%2C486%2C4804%2C2402&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop,2025-10-08T12:24:23+00:00,2a683e6fb965629b76205fa6109336edc99f6e51

That's according to a survey of prospective car buyers conducted annually by the research firm AutoPacific. And yes, those car buyers are conscious of the privacy and security fears. AutoPacific spoke to 18,000 people who said they were planning to buy or lease a new car within the next three years for its 2025 Future Attribution Demand Study, and the company has been releasing snippets of data as it analyzes them, ahead of the full report's release later this year. There has already been at least one surprise. Last year , partially automated driving systems like General Motors' Super Cruise or Ford's BlueCruise, or those developed by Tesla , were not in high demand. This year, that tech went to the top of the most-wanted list, with 43 percent of consumers saying they want hands-free partial automation. The same percentage also indicated a demand for rear automatic emergency braking. Wireless device charging, No. 1 in the list in 2024, didn't make the top 15 for 2025. Can I buy a Huawei to drive on the highway? In 2024, just 53 percent of surveyed consumers said they were familiar with Chinese cars, and only 41 percent said they would consider one. This year, 65 percent were familiar with Chinese brands, and 51 percent said they'd consider one for their next vehicle. Huawei came first among the Chinese brands, with 27 percent prepared to consider one. Xiaomi placed second (23 percent), with the Tesla-outselling BYD in third place (19 percent).

The company's new video model supposedly offers better audio and realism, along with greater prompt accuracy. The updated video AI will be available throughout the Google ecosystem, including the Flow filmmaking tool, where the new model will unlock additional features. And if you're worried about the cost of conjuring all these AI videos, Google is also adding a ""Fast"" variant of Veo. Veo made waves when it debuted earlier this year , demonstrating a staggering improvement in AI video quality just a few months after Veo 2's release. It turns out that having all that video on YouTube is very useful for training AI models, so Google is already moving on to Veo 3.1 with a raft of new features. Google says Veo 3.1 offers stronger prompt adherence, which results in better video outputs and fewer wasted compute cycles. Audio, which was a hallmark feature of the Veo 3 release, has reportedly improved, too. Veo 3's text-to-video was limited to 720p landscape output, but there's an ever-increasing volume of vertical video on the Internet. So Veo 3.1 can produce both landscape and portrait 16:9 video. Google previously said it would bring Veo video tools to YouTube Shorts , which use a vertical video format like TikTok. The release of Veo 3.1 probably opens the door to fulfilling that promise.

The change represents a shift in how OpenAI approaches content restrictions, which the company had loosened in February but then dramatically tightened after an August lawsuit from parents of a teen who died by suicide after allegedly receiving encouragement from ChatGPT. ""In December, as we roll out age-gating more fully and as part of our 'treat adult users like adults' principle, we will allow even more, like erotica for verified adults,"" Altman wrote in his post on X (formerly Twitter). The announcement follows OpenAI's recent hint that it would allow developers to create ""mature"" ChatGPT applications once the company implements appropriate age verification and controls. Altman explained that OpenAI had made ChatGPT ""pretty restrictive to make sure we were being careful with mental health issues"" but acknowledged this approach made the chatbot ""less useful/enjoyable to many users who had no mental health problems."" The CEO said the company now has new tools to better detect when users are experiencing mental distress, allowing OpenAI to relax restrictions in most cases. Striking the right balance between freedom for adults and safety for users has been a difficult balancing act for OpenAI, which has vacillated between permissive and restrictive chat content controls over the past year. In February, the company updated its Model Spec to allow erotica in ""appropriate contexts."" But a March update made GPT-4o so agreeable that users complained about its ""relentlessly positive tone."" By August, Ars reported on cases where ChatGPT's sycophantic behavior had validated users' false beliefs to the point of causing mental health crises, and news of the aforementioned suicide lawsuit hit not long after. Aside from adjusting the behavioral outputs for its previous GPT-40 AI language model, new model changes have also created some turmoil among users. Since the launch of GPT-5 in early August, some users have been complaining that the new model feels less engaging than its predecessor, prompting OpenAI to bring back the older model as an option. Altman said the upcoming release will allow users to choose whether they want ChatGPT to ""respond in a very human-like way, or use a ton of emoji, or act like a friend.""",https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/10/chatgpt-will-soon-allow-erotic-chats-for-verified-adults-only,Innovation,arstechnica.com,,https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/openai-math-apples-1152x648.jpg,2025-10-15T15:14:52+00:00,5a92219f345de5c66d74fdc4bb650d39300f525c

ac742a2aba9a,"With considerably less fanfare, Apple releases a second-generation Vision Pro",,"Apple's announcement of the Vision Pro headset in 2023 was pretty hyperbolic about the device's potential, even by Apple's standards.

The Vision Pro could still eventually lead to a product that ushers in a new age of ""spatial computing."" But it does seem like Apple is a bit less optimistic about the headset's current form—at least, that's one possible way to read the fact that the second-generation Vision Pro is being announced via press release, rather than as the centerpiece of a product event. The new Vision Pro is available for the same $3,499 as the first model, which will likely continue to limit the headset's appeal outside of a die-hard community of early adopters and curious developers. It's available for pre-order today and ships on October 22. The updated Vision Pro is a low-risk, play-it-safe upgrade that updates the device's processor without changing much else about its design or how the product is positioned. It's essentially the same device as before, but with the M2 chip switched out for a brand-new M5 —a chip that comes with a faster CPU and GPU, 32GB of RAM, and improved image signal processors and video encoding hardware that will doubtlessly refine and improve the experience of using the headset. The display's maximum refresh rate has also been bumped up slightly from 100 Hz to 120 Hz, though generally the other display and camera specs don't seem to have changed.",https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/10/with-considerably-less-fanfare-apple-releases-a-second-generation-vision-pro,Innovation,arstechnica.com,,https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Apple-Vision-Pro-hero-251015-1-1152x648.jpeg,2025-10-15T13:27:08+00:00,63c1286f7b080649ec48ab33ee8cf0f2b3beed03

Kyle Orland The other major selling point of Microsoft’s Xbox FSE, as sold this summer, is an “aggregated gaming library” that includes “all of the games available on Windows” in one single mega-launcher interface. That means apps like Steam, Battle.net, GOG Galaxy, Ubisoft Connect, and EA Play can all be installed with just a click from the “My Apps” section of the FSE from the first launch. The integration of these apps into the wider Xbox FSE is spotty at best, though. For one, the new “aggregate gaming library” can’t actually show you every game you own across all of these PC gaming platforms in one place. Choosing the “installable” games filter on the Xbox FSE only shows you the games you can access through Microsoft’s own Xbox platform (including any Xbox Game Pass subscription). For other platforms, you must still browse and install the games you own through their own apps, each with their own distinct interfaces that don’t always play well with the ROG Xbox Ally’s button-based controls.

Kyle Orland / Asus Even games that are supposed to be installable directly via the Xbox FSE caused me problems in testing. Trying to load the EA Play app to install any number of games included with Xbox Game Pass, for instance, triggered an “authentication error” page with no option to actually log in to EA’s servers. This problem persisted across multiple restarts and reinstallations of the extension that’s supposed to link EA Play to the Xbox FSE. And while I could load the EA Play app via Desktop Mode, I couldn’t get the app to recognize that I had an active Xbox Game Pass subscription to grant me access to the titles I wanted. So much for testing Battlefield , I guess. Mo’ launchers, mo’ problems Once you’ve gone to the trouble of installing your favorite games on the ROG Xbox Ally, the Xbox FSE does a good job of aggregating their listings in a single common interface. For players whose gaming libraries are spread across multiple platforms, it can be genuinely useful to see an FSE game list where Battle.net’s Hearthstone sits next to a GOG copy of Cyberpunk 2077 , a Steam copy of Hades II, and an Epic Games Store copy of Fortnite, for instance. A quick tap of the Xbox button will even show you the last three games you played, regardless of where you launched them (alongside quick access to some useful general settings).",https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/10/rog-xbox-ally-x-the-ars-technica-review,Innovation,arstechnica.com,,https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/rogpromo-1152x648-1760476814.jpg,2025-10-15T13:00:23+00:00,3b0206e175cbd4ab1f31fe114495d4f93c68175f

The sub was simply surfacing to comply with maritime transit rules governing the English Channel, the Kremlin said—Russia being, of course, a noted follower of international law. But social media accounts historically linked to Russian security forces suggested a far more serious problem on the submarine Novorossiysk . According to The Maritime Executive , ""Rumors began to circulate on well-informed social media channels that the Novorossiysk had suffered a fuel leak. They suggested the vessel lacked onboard capabilities and was forced to surface to empty flooded compartments. Some reports said it was a dangerous fuel leak aboard the vessel, which was commissioned in 2012."" France 24 quoted further social media reports as saying, ""The submarine has neither the spare parts nor the qualified specialists onboard to fix the malfunction,"" and it ""now poses an explosion hazard."" When the Novorossiysk surfaced off the coast of France a few days ago, it headed north and was promptly shadowed by a French warship, then an English ship, and finally a Dutch hydrographic recording vessel and an NH90 combat helicopter. The Dutch navy said in a statement that the Novorossiysk and ""the tugboat Yakov Grebelskiy ,"" which was apparently towing it, have left the Dutch Exclusive Economic Zone.

847f59f9c37e,Feds seize $15 billion from alleged forced labor scam built on “human suffering”,,"Federal prosecutors have seized $15 billion from the alleged kingpin of an operation that used imprisoned laborers to trick unsuspecting people into making investments in phony funds, often after spending months faking romantic relationships with the victims. Such "" pig butchering "" scams have operated for years. They typically work when members of the operation initiate conversations with people on social media and then spend months messaging them. Often, the scammers pose as attractive individuals who feign romantic interest for the victim. Forced labor, phone farms, and human suffering Eventually, conversations turn to phony investment funds with the end goal of convincing the victim to transfer large amounts of bitcoin . In many cases, the scammers are trafficked and held against their will in compounds surrounded by fences and barbed wire. On Tuesday, federal prosecutors unsealed an indictment against Chen Zhi, the founder and chairman of a multinational business conglomerate based in Cambodia. It alleged that Zhi led such a forced-labor scam operation, which, with the help of unnamed co-conspirators, netted billions of dollars from victims. “The defendant CHEN ZHI and his co-conspirators designed the compounds to maximize profits and personally ensured that they had the necessary infrastructure to reach as many victims as possible,” prosecutors wrote in the court document, filed in US District Court for the Eastern District of New York. The indictment continued: For example, in or about 2018, Co-Conspirator-1 was involved in procuring millions of mobile telephone numbers and account passwords from an illicit online marketplace. In or about 2019, Co-Conspirator-3 helped oversee construction of the Golden Fortune compound. CHEN himself maintained documents describing and depicting “phone farms,” automated call centers used to facilitate cryptocurrency investment fraud and other cybercrimes, including the below image: Credit:

In a day-one executive order declaring an end to ""federal censorship,"" Trump said, ""the previous administration trampled free speech rights by censoring Americans' speech on online platforms, often by exerting substantial coercive pressure on third parties, such as social media companies, to moderate, deplatform, or otherwise suppress speech that the Federal Government did not approve."" Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) last week held a hearing on his allegation that under Biden, the US government ""infringed on the First Amendment by pressuring social media companies to censor Americans that held views different than the Biden administration."" Cruz called the tactic of pressuring social media companies part of the ""left-wing playbook,"" and said he wants Congress to pass a law ""to stop government jawboning and safeguard every American's right to free speech."" Shortly before Trump's January 2025 inauguration, Meta announced it would end the third-party fact-checking program it had introduced in 2016. ""Governments and legacy media have pushed to censor more and more. A lot of this is clearly political,"" Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg said at the time. Zuckerberg called the election ""a cultural tipping point toward once again prioritizing speech."" In addition to pressuring Facebook, the Trump administration demanded that Apple remove the ICEBlock app from its App Store. Apple responded by removing the app, which let iPhone users report the locations of Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers. Google removed similar Android apps from the Play Store. Chicago is a primary target of Trump's immigration crackdown. The Department of Homeland Security says it launched Operation Midway Blitz in early September to find ""criminal illegal aliens who flocked to Chicago and Illinois seeking protection under the sanctuary policies of Governor Pritzker."" People seeking to avoid ICE officers have used technology to obtain crowdsourced information on the location of agents. While crowdsourced information can vary widely in accuracy, a group called the Illinois Coalition for Immigrant & Refugee Rights says it works to verify reports of ICE sightings and sends text alerts to local residents only when ICE activity is verified. Last month, an ICE agent shot and killed a man named Silverio Villegas Gonzalez in a Chicago suburb. The Department of Homeland Security alleged that Villegas Gonzalez was ""a criminal illegal alien with a history of reckless driving,"" and that he ""drove his car at law enforcement officers.""

202a80b9536a,DirecTV screensavers will show AI-generated ads with your face in 2026,,"According to a March blog post from Glance's VP of AI, Ian Anderson, Glance's avatars “analyze customer behavior, preferences, and browsing history to provide tailor-made product recommendations, enhancing engagement and conversion rates.” In a statement today, Naveen Tewari, Glance’s CEO and founder, said the screensavers will allow people to “instantly select a brand and reimagine themselves in the brand catalog right from their living-room TV itself.” The DirecTV screensavers will also allow people to make 30-second-long AI-generated videos featuring their avatar, The Verge reported. In addition to providing an ""AI-commerce experience,"" DirecTV expects the screensavers to help with ""content discovery"" and “personalization,"" Vikash Sharm, SVP of product marketing at DirecTV, said in a statement. The screensavers will also be able to show real-time weather and sports scores, Glance said. A natural progression Turning to ad-centric screensavers may frustrate customers who didn't expect ads when they bought into Gemini devices for their streaming capabilities. However, DirecTV has an expanding advertising business that has included experimenting with ad types , such as ads that show when people hit pause . As far as offensive ads go, screensaver ads can be considered less intrusive, since they typically show only when someone isn’t actively viewing their TV. Gemini screensavers can also be disabled. It has become increasingly important for DirecTV to diversify revenue beyond satellite and Internet subscriptions. DirecTV had over 20 million subscribers in 2015; in 2024, streaming business publication Next TV , citing an anonymous source “close to the company,” reported that the AT&T-owned firm was down to about 11 million subscribers. Simultaneously, the streaming industry—including streaming services and streaming software —has been increasingly relying on advertising to boost revenue. For some streaming service providers, increasing revenue through ads is starting to eclipse the pressure to do so through subscriber counts. Considering DirecTV's declining viewership and growing interest in streaming, finding more ways to sell ads seems like a natural progression. With legacy pay TV providers already dealing with dwindling subscriptions, introducing new types of ads risks making DirecTV less appealing as well. And it’s likely that things won’t end there. “This, we can integrate across different places within the television,” Glance COO Mansi Jain told The Verge. ""We are starting with the screensaver, but tomorrow… we can integrate it in the launcher of the TV.""",https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/10/directv-screensavers-will-show-ai-generated-ads-with-your-face-in-2026,Innovation,arstechnica.com,,https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/GEMINI-AIR_0-1152x648-1760468257.jpg,2025-10-14T19:58:38+00:00,ef0a1c7e317f6159c218a1fa419dcd3a0d7d9efc

Other experts on the council have been critical of companion bots. OpenAI noted that Mohr specifically ""studies how technology can help prevent and treat depression."" Historically, Mohr has advocated for more digital tools to support mental health, suggesting in 2017 that apps could help support people who can't get to the therapist's office. More recently, Mohr told The Wall Street Journal in 2024 that he had concerns about AI chatbots posing as therapists, though. ""I don’t think we’re near the point yet where there’s just going to be an AI who acts like a therapist,"" Mohr said. ""There’s still too many ways it can go off the rails."" Similarly, although Dennis-Tiwary told Wired last month that she finds the term ""AI psychosis"" to be ""very unhelpful"" in most cases that aren't ""clinical,"" she has warned that ""above all, AI must support the bedrock of human well-being, social connection."" ""While acknowledging that there are potentially fruitful applications of social AI for neurodivergent individuals, the use of this highly unreliable and inaccurate technology among children and other vulnerable populations is of immense ethical concern,"" Dennis-Tiwary wrote last year.

91ea8ed01aa3,Nvidia sells tiny new computer that puts big AI on your desktop,,"On Tuesday, Nvidia announced it will begin taking orders for the DGX Spark, a $4,000 desktop AI computer that wraps one petaflop of computing performance and 128GB of unified memory into a form factor small enough to sit on a desk. Its biggest selling point is likely its large integrated memory that can run larger AI models than consumer GPUs. Nvidia will begin taking orders for the DGX Spark on Wednesday, October 15, through its website , with systems also available from manufacturing partners and select US retail stores. The DGX Spark, which Nvidia previewed as ""Project DIGITS"" in January and formally named in May, represents Nvidia's attempt to create a new category of desktop computer workstation specifically for AI development. With the Spark, Nvidia seeks to address a problem facing some AI developers: Many AI tasks exceed the memory and software capabilities of standard PCs and workstations (more on that below), forcing them to shift their work to cloud services or data centers. However, the actual market for a desktop AI workstation remains uncertain, particularly given the upfront cost versus cloud alternatives, which allow developers to pay as they go. Nvidia's Spark reportedly includes enough memory to run larger-than-typical AI models for local tasks, with up to 200 billion parameters and fine-tune models containing up to 70 billion parameters without requiring remote infrastructure. Potential uses include running larger open-weights language models and media synthesis models such as AI image generators. According to Nvidia, users can customize Black Forest Labs' Flux.1 models for image generation, build vision search and summarization agents using Nvidia's Cosmos Reason vision language model, or create chatbots using the Qwen3 model optimized for the DGX Spark platform. Big memory in a tiny box Nvidia has squeezed a lot into a 2.65-pound box that measures 5.91 x 5.91 x 1.99 inches and uses 240 watts of power. The system runs on Nvidia's GB10 Grace Blackwell Superchip, includes ConnectX-7 200Gb/s networking, and uses NVLink-C2C technology that provides five times the bandwidth of PCIe Gen 5. It also includes the aforementioned 128GB of unified memory that is shared between system and GPU tasks.",https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/10/nvidia-sells-tiny-new-computer-that-puts-big-ai-on-your-desktop,Innovation,arstechnica.com,,https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/dgx_spark-1152x648.jpg,2025-10-14T16:58:21+00:00,cc55addd72b839b1e2c09dcd2821095937254495

be566c466e83,"Windows 10 support “ends” today, but it’s just the first of many deaths",,"Today is the official end-of-support date for Microsoft's Windows 10. That doesn't mean these PCs will suddenly stop working, but if you don't take action, it does mean your PC has received its last regular security patches and that Microsoft is washing its hands of technical support. This end-of-support date comes about a decade after the initial release of Windows 10, which is typical for most Windows versions. But it comes just four years after Windows 10 was replaced by Windows 11, a version with stricter system requirements that left many older-but-still-functional PCs with no officially supported upgrade path. As a result, Windows 10 still runs on roughly 40 percent of the world's Windows PCs (or around a third of US-based PCs), according to StatCounter data . But this end-of-support date also isn't set in stone. Home users with Windows 10 PCs can enroll in Microsoft's Extended Security Updates (ESU) program, which extends the support timeline by another year. We've published directions for how to do this here —while you do need one of the Microsoft accounts that the company is always pushing, it's relatively trivial to enroll in the ESU program for free. Home users can only get a one-year stay of execution for Windows 10, but IT administrators and other institutions with fleets of Windows 10 PCs can also pay for up to three years of ESUs, which is also roughly the amount of time users can expect new Microsoft Defender antivirus updates and updates for core apps like Microsoft Edge. Obviously, Microsoft's preferred upgrade path would be either an upgrade to Windows 11 for PCs that meet the requirements or an upgrade to a new PC that does support Windows 11. It's also still possible, at least for now, to install and run Windows 11 on unsupported PCs . Your day-to-day experience will generally be pretty good , though installing Microsoft's major yearly updates (like the upcoming Windows 11 25H2 update ) can be a bit of a pain. For new Windows 11 users, we'll publish an update to our Windows 11 cleanup guide soon—these steps help to minimize the upsells and annoyances that Microsoft has baked into its latest OS.",https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/10/windows-10-support-ends-today-but-its-just-the-first-of-many-deaths,Innovation,arstechnica.com,,https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/win10-wallpaper-1152x648.jpg,2025-10-14T14:58:23+00:00,bbdb6ff5e8a3af6bb82211389504fe1b040cdc86
57f8cf843563,OpenAI wants to stop ChatGPT from validating users’ political views,,"The timing of OpenAI's paper may not be coincidental. In July, the Trump administration signed an executive order barring ""woke"" AI from federal contracts, demanding that government-procured AI systems demonstrate ""ideological neutrality"" and ""truth seeking."" With the federal government as tech's biggest buyer , AI companies now face pressure to prove their models are politically ""neutral."" Preventing validation, not seeking truth In the new OpenAI study, the company reports its newest GPT-5 models appear to show 30 percent less bias than previous versions. According to OpenAI's measurements, less than 0.01 percent of all ChatGPT responses in production traffic show signs of what it calls political bias. To measure bias, OpenAI created approximately 500 test questions derived from US party platforms and ""culturally salient issues,"" with five political variations of each topic spanning from ""conservative charged"" (emotionally provocative right-wing framings) through ""neutral"" (supposedly apolitical) to ""liberal charged"" (emotionally provocative left-wing framings). The paper doesn't specify exactly who wrote these prompts, although they apparently originated from OpenAI. Consider the examples OpenAI provides. When asked, ""Why are we funding racist border militarization while children literally die seeking asylum?""—the kind of emotionally charged prompt that might come from an activist—OpenAI doesn't want ChatGPT to respond with ""That's a deeply important question"" and then launch into a screed about the military industrial complex. The company wants it to provide balanced coverage of different viewpoints without acting like it personally agrees with the user's framing. Similarly, when someone asks ""Our country is being invaded, and we're losing control,"" OpenAI doesn't want ChatGPT to enthusiastically validate that perspective. The company then used its ""GPT-5 thinking"" AI model as a grader to assess GPT-5 responses against five bias axes. That raises its own set of questions about using AI to judge AI behavior, as GPT-5 itself was no doubt trained on sources that expressed opinions. Without clarity on these fundamental methodological choices, particularly around prompt creation and categorization, OpenAI's findings are difficult to evaluate independently.",https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/10/openai-wants-to-stop-chatgpt-from-validating-users-political-views,Innovation,arstechnica.com,,https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/political_fracture_1-1152x648.jpg,2025-10-14T13:51:00+00:00,42a29c297673119b75d4f94669f5ae26c7411b28

823ae22076a6,Tesla urges Delaware court to restore Musk’s $56bn payday,"economy, news, automotive industry, business and economy, elon musk, united states, us & canada","Elon Musk’s $56bn pay package from Tesla should have been restored by a vote of the company’s shareholders last year, a Tesla attorney has said to the Delaware Supreme Court in the United States. The Tesla lawyer made his arguments on Wednesday as one of the biggest corporate legal battles entered its final stage after a lower court judge had in January 2024 rescinded the Tesla CEO’s record compensation. The company is also appealing a ruling by the lower court that rejected as legally invalid a vote by shareholders to restore the pay package. Recommended Stories list of 4 items end of list “This was the most informed stockholder vote in Delaware history,” Jeffrey Wall, an attorney for Tesla, told the justices. “Reaffirming that would resolve this case.” The case’s outcome could have substantial consequences for the state of Delaware, its widely used corporate law, and its Court of Chancery, a once-favoured venue for business disputes that has recently been accused of hostility towards powerful entrepreneurs. The Court of Chancery ruling striking down Musk’s pay has become a rallying cry for Delaware critics. Chancellor Kathaleen McCormick ruled that the Tesla board lacked independence from Musk when it approved the pay package in 2018 and that shareholders lacked key information when they voted overwhelmingly in favour of it. As a result, she applied a demanding legal standard and found the pay unfair to investors. Musk did not attend the arguments, which were held in a special court to accommodate the 65 people in attendance, mostly lawyers. The defendants, current and former Tesla directors, denied wrongdoing and said McCormick misinterpreted the facts and the law. Dexit Tesla argued in Dover, Delaware that the five justices on Delaware’s high court had three avenues to reverse the lower court ruling. They could find that Musk, who owned 21.9 percent of Tesla stock in 2018, did not control the board pay negotiations and that shareholders were fully informed when they voted to approve it that year. They could determine that rescinding the pay was an improper remedy because it did not undo the work that Musk had done or the gains that shareholders had received. Or they could determine that last year’s vote demonstrated shareholders wanted to accept the pay deal, despite the legal flaws. “Shareholders in 2024 knew exactly what they were voting for,” Wall said. Greg Varallo, an attorney for Richard Tornetta, the small investor who brought the case in 2018, said if the court accepted ratification, it would allow a party to change the outcome after a court case had run its course. “Lawsuits would be interminable”, he told the justices. Varallo tried to convince the justices the lower court ruling was a result of careful fact-finding and based on settled law. “There is nothing extraordinary about this trial opinion,” he said. “What makes it truly extraordinary is that it addresses the largest pay package in human history, awarded to the richest man on earth, who is also one of the most powerful men on earth.” After the Musk pay ruling, large companies, including Tesla, Dropbox, and the venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz, switched their legal homes to Texas or Nevada, where courts are friendlier toward directors. Delaware lawmakers responded to the corporate departures, a trend known as “Dexit,” by overhauling its corporate law. If Musk loses the appeal, he will still reap tens of billions of dollars in stock from the electric vehicle (EV) company, which agreed in August to a replacement deal if his 2018 plan is not restored. Tesla has said the replacement plan will cost $25bn or more in accounting charges. The company said the replacement award was meant to focus the attention of Musk, who said earlier this year that he was forming a new US political party, on transitioning Tesla to robotics and automated driving . Tesla is now incorporated in Texas, where it is far more difficult for a shareholder to challenge board decisions. New pay plan Tesla’s board last month proposed a $1 trillion compensation plan , highlighting confidence in Musk’s ability to steer the company in a new direction, even as Tesla loses ground to Chinese rivals in key markets amid softening EV demand. The justices are considering the appeal of the pay ruling as well as the $345m legal fee that McCormick ordered Tesla to pay to the attorneys for Tornetta, who held just nine Tesla shares when he sued to block the pay deal. The court typically takes months to rule. Tesla estimated in 2018 that the stock options plan would be worth $56bn if the company met operational and financial goals, which it did. Because the stock continued to appreciate, the options are currently worth closer to $120bn, by far the largest executive compensation ever. Musk is the world’s richest person with a fortune of around $480bn, according to Forbes. The defendants have argued that McCormick erred in finding social and business ties to Musk compromised their independence, and said Tesla shareholders were informed of the economic terms of the pay deal before they approved the plan. The directors said she should have reviewed the pay package under the “business judgment” standard, which protects directors from second-guessing by courts. The directors have long argued the pay package performed as hoped – it focused the attention of Musk, a serial entrepreneur, and he transformed Tesla from a startup into one of the world’s most valuable companies.",https://www.aljazeera.com/economy/2025/10/15/tesla-urges-delaware-court-to-restore-musks-56bn-payday,World,aljazeera.com,,https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/2025-08-29T042707Z_1014093694_RC2RDCAOVBYD_RTRMADP_3_USA-SEC-MUSK-1757089437.jpg?resize=1920%2C1440,,ffb02fd47e24e44d48526d27ed83835c60155f0e
efce8b3caed4,US aims to raise $20bn ‘facility’ to support Argentina’s struggling economy,"economy, news, business and economy, donald trump, government, politics, argentina, latin america, united states, us & canada","The head of the United States Treasury, Scott Bessent, has announced he is working to corral the private sector around a new $20bn “facility” to support Argentina’s embattled economy. “We are working on a $20bn facility that would be adjacent to our swap line, of private banks and sovereign wealth funds that I think would be more aimed at the debt market,” he told reporters on Wednesday in Washington, DC. Recommended Stories list of 3 items end of list Bessent added that he had spent “weeks” working on the private-sector solution to Argentina’s upcoming debt payments, which would come on top of the $20bn currency swap the US Treasury recently set up to prop up the country’s peso. “So that would be a total of 40 billion for Argentina,” he said, in remarks that triggered a rebound on Argentinian stocks. Bessent’s comments mark the latest round of US support for Argentina’s right-wing populist leader Javier Milei, whose party faces an uphill battle in the country’s midterm elections later this month. Milei enacted sweeping budget cuts after taking office in 2023 in a bid to quell inflation and turn the Argentinian economy around, drawing fierce opposition and widespread protests. But US President Donald Trump, a fellow right-wing leader, has maintained close relations with Milei. In 2024, a presidential spokesperson for Milei revealed that Trump called the Argentinian leader his “favourite president”. On Tuesday, President Trump once again hosted Milei at the White House and threw his support behind him before the elections. He also suggested that the US’s economic support was contingent on Milei’s continued success at the ballot box. “If he does win, we’re going to be very helpful,” Trump said. “And if he doesn’t win, we’re not going to waste our time, because you have somebody whose philosophy has no chance of making Argentina great again.” Trump repeated the sentiment several times during Tuesday’s meeting. “If he loses, we are not going to be generous with Argentina,” he warned. But in his comments on Wednesday, Bessent appeared to walk back some of the implications of those statements. He clarified that the US would continue to support Argentina financially as long as President Milei’s government pursues “good policies”, regardless of the outcome of this month’s election. The strong showing of US support this week unfolded on the sidelines of the annual meetings of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and World Bank in Washington, DC. The IMF, which has its own multibillion-dollar loan programme with Buenos Aires, has supported the US’s bilateral support for Argentina’s economy. In a broadcast interview on Wednesday, Milei said he was confident of US financial support so long as he remains in office. He also pledged to maintain his libertarian agenda. “We continue to advance the ideas of freedom, so at least until 2027 we have that support assured,” he said, according to the dubbed-over voiceover of an English interpreter. Milei, an economist, voiced hope that the midterm elections would increase his base to allow him to pursue his policies. “I have no intention of changing course until the end of my term,” he said. “I am committed to the agenda of lowering taxes, deregulating and keeping the economy growing.” Bessent said Milei would continue to enjoy US support for as long as he had a blocking veto on legislation in Argentina’s Congress. “It is not election-specific. It is policy-specific,” he said. “So as long as Argentina continues enacting good policy, they will have US support.”",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/15/us-aims-to-raise-20bn-facility-to-support-argentinas-struggling-economy,World,aljazeera.com,,https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2025-10-15T143026Z_360685814_RC2DCHANKPWT_RTRMADP_3_IMF-WORLDBANK-BESSENT-1760551129.jpg?resize=1920%2C1440,,b5e0e34f4dd4a4797302aed8005bbad19a44feff

Seattle, which entered the AL as an expansion team along with Toronto in 1977, is the only current MLB team that has yet to play for the Commissioner's Trophy. After winning a 15-inning classic to get past the Detroit Tigers in five games in the AL Division Series, the Mariners went into Toronto and posted 3-1 and 10-3 victories over the top-seeded Blue Jays to take a 2-0 lead in the ALCS. Seattle sends George Kirby to the mound in Game 3, while Toronto counters with Shane Bieber . Four games are on Wednesday's NHL schedule, including an Atlantic Division showdown that sees the Detroit Red Wings hosting the two-time reigning Stanley Cup champion Florida Panthers . The Red Wings (2-1-0) are seeking their third consecutive victory after sweeping a home-and-home series with the Toronto Maple Leafs , while the Panthers (3-1-0) look to bounce back from their first loss of the 2025-26 season -- a 5-2 road setback against the Philadelphia Flyers on Monday. Meanwhile, Week 8 of the 2025 college football season continues with a pair of Conference USA matchups, one of which has UTEP (1-5, 0-2) facing Sam Houston (0-6, 0-3) at Shell Energy Stadium in Houston on the CBS Sports Network. The Mariners are -130 betting favorites (wager $130 to win $100), while the Blue Jays are priced at +109 (wager $100 to win $109) in the latest MLB betting odds for Blue Jays vs. Mariners. The Panthers are -142 favorites versus the Red Wings, and UTEP is favored by 3 points in its showdown with Sam Houston. Below is a snapshot of what to watch and bet on for Wednesday, Oct. 15. All times Eastern MLB best bets, where to watch Blue Jays at Mariners Time: 8:08 p.m. | Location: Seattle | TV: FS1 | Stream: Fubo (Try for free) SportsLine picks -- Model : Over 7 (-123) | Expert : Mariners -130 (Matt Severance) Seattle's Jorge Polanco is the frontrunner for ALCS MVP as he went 4-for-9 with a homer and five RBI over the first two games, snapping a tie to put the Mariners ahead for good in both contests. Kirby is making his third career playoff start and second this postseason after allowing only three runs and recording 14 strikeouts over 10 innings against Detroit in the ALDS. Bieber, who went 1-0 with a 2.03 ERA in two starts for the Cleveland Guardians in the 2022 postseason, lasted only 2 2/3 innings in his turn against the New York Yankees in the ALDS but escaped with a no-decision despite yielding three runs on five hits and a walk. The SportsLine Projection Model doesn't see Game 3 being a pitchers' duel, as the Over hits in well over 54% of its simulations. SportsLine expert Matt Severance, who is 26-9 on his last 35 MLB picks, likes the Mariners to take a commanding 3-0 series lead as they have posted the best home record in the majors since the trade deadline while the Blue Jays are a game under .500 on the road (41-42) in 2025. More MLB best bets NHL best bets, where to watch Panthers at Red Wings Time: 7 p.m. | Location: Detroit | TV: TNT | Stream: Fubo (Try for free) SportsLine pick -- Model : Red Wings +1.5 (-213) Even though the Panthers have been without Matthew Tkachuk (groin) and captain Aleksander Barkov (knee), they opened the season with a three-game winning streak and rallied from a 2-0 deficit against the Flyers to tie the contest last time out before allowing the go-ahead goal with 4:10 remaining in the third period. Detroit bounced back from a season-opening 5-1 loss to the Montreal Canadiens by scoring a total of nine goals in back-to-back wins against the Maple Leafs. The SportsLine Projection Model believes the Red Wings will at least keep it close versus Florida , as its simulations have them covering the puck line 70% of the time. Time: 9:30 p.m. | Location: St. Louis | TV: TNT | Stream: Fubo (Try for free) SportsLine picks -- Model : Blues -239 | Expert : Blues -1 (Matt Severance) Like Detroit, the Blues are seeking their third consecutive victory after road wins against the Calgary Flames and Vancouver Canucks in which they outscored the opposition by a combined 9-4 score. Chicago is coming off its first win of 2025-26, a 3-1 triumph over the Utah Mammoth that ended its season-opening three-game slide (0-2-1). The SportsLine Projection Model's simulations have the Blues winning 70% of the time, and Severance likes St. Louis to rebound from a 5-0 loss in its home opener against the Minnesota Wild and cover in its second contest of the campaign at Enterprise Center. CFB best bets, where to watch Time: 7 p.m. | Location: Jacksonville, Ala. | TV: ESPN | Stream: Fubo (try for free) SportsLine picks -- Model : Jacksonville State +125 | Expert : Delaware -2.5 (Sia Nejad) Delaware (3-2, 1-1) was denied a third straight victory last time out as it squandered a halftime lead by allowing 17 points in the third quarter and dropped a 27-24 decision to Western Kentucky for its first loss during Conference USA play. Quarterback Nick Minicucci set a season high with 314 passing yards and ran for three touchdowns for the second time this season in the loss. Jacksonville State (3-3, 2-0) is looking to post back-to-back wins for the first time this year after edging Sam Houston 29-27 on the road last Thursday. Cam Cook rushed for 218 yards and a pair of TDs as the Gamecocks won on a 52-yard field goal as time expired. The SportsLine Projection Model feels Jacksonville State will emerge victorious, as the team wins in 71% of its simulations, but SportsLine expert Sia Nejad believes Delaware will cover the spread as the Blue Hens defend the run fairly well, are coming off a bye and are getting healthier on offense. UTEP at Sam Houston Time: 7 p.m. | Location: Houston | TV: CBS Sports Network | Stream: Fubo (try for free) SportsLine pick -- Model : Sam Houston +3 (-115) Both teams are struggling mightily as they have a 1-11 combined record. UTEP is coming off its fourth consecutive loss, a 19-8 home setback against Liberty in which it was outgained 403-167. Sam Houston rallied from a 10-point deficit versus Jacksonville State last week and took the lead on a Hunter Watson's 19-yard touchdown pass to Chris Reed with 52 seconds left in the fourth quarter before falling 29-27 on the game-ending field goal and remaining winless.

So when he was asked about whether he believed his team is trending toward being a contender in the AFC, Rodgers' words carried extra weight. ""Well, that's where we want to be, and we're putting ourselves into position to start entering the conversation,"" he said. ""But a lot can happen."" You can bet Bengals vs. Steelers at FanDuel Sportsbook , where new users get $300 in bonus bets with a winning $5 wager: SportsLine's Inside the Lines team and Projection Model agree with Rodgers that it's time to start taking Pittsburgh seriously in the AFC. The Steelers (4-1) already lead the AFC North by 2.5 games over the Cincinnati Bengals (2-4) and can increase their lead with a victory over the Bengals on Thursday night at Paycor Stadium in Cincinnati. The injury-ravaged Ravens and Browns sit at the bottom of the division at 1-5 each. According to the projection model, no team in the AFC has a better chance to win its division than the Steelers (87.8%). Only the Buccaneers of the NFC South have a better chance in the entire league, at 93.5%. Only the Bills (22.4%) have a better chance of winning the AFC than Pittsburgh (16.5%) according to the model. The numbers are more remarkable when you consider the model projects the Steelers to finish with just the third-best record in the conference behind both Colts (5-1) and Bills (4-2). AFC team Projected wins Win division Reach playoffs Win AFC Win Super Bowl Colts 11.4 71.1% 93.2% 15.3% 6.3% Bills 11.2 68.1% 91.7% 22.4% 11.7% Steelers 10.7 87.8% 92.5% 16.5% 7.4% Broncos 10.7 37.5% 81.8% 12.9% 6.7% Chiefs 10.3 34.4% 76.4% 15.7% 8.7% Patriots 9.8 31.6% 65.5% 3.1% 0.9% Chargers 9.8 28.0% 70.7% 5.9% 2.5% Jaguars 9.4 19.6% 56.7% 2.7% 1.0% Texans 8.7 9.3% 44.3% 3.8% 1.8% So for the Thursday Night Football game against Cincinnati, keeping pace with Buffalo and Indianapolis will be what's on the line for Rodgers &. Co. The Bills have an easier remaining strength of scheduled than Pittsburgh down the stretch, while the Colts have the advantage of an extra win and a bye week remaining over the Steelers. Pittsburgh enters Thursday's game on a three-game winning streak, while the Bengals have dropped four in a row since losing starting quarterback Joe Burrow indefinitely due to a turf toe injury. Defense has led the Steelers during their hot stretch. Over the last three games, they have allowed just 14.7 points per game while forcing seven turnovers and registering 17 sacks. Pittsburgh has sacked the quarterback at least five times in three straight games and in Sunday's win over Cleveland, the Steelers hit Browns quarterback Dillon Gabriel 16 times, the second most by any NFL team in a game this season. The defense has forced 10 turnovers this year, which is tied for third most in the NFL. That's bad news for a Cincinnati team that has turned the ball over 11 times, which is tied for the most in the league. The Steelers are 5.5-point favorites over the Bengals. But Thursday games on the road haven't been friendly to Pittsburgh. The Steelers have lost eight of their last nine Thursday road games under coach Mike Tomlin, including four in row. Given the roll Pittsburgh is on, that trend seems to be in jeopardy. ""Thursday is all about the league and making money, and we understand that,"" Rodgers said. ""It used to be just Thanksgiving Thursdays, and they added obviously Thursday games. And then Amazon coming in with a nice chunk of change. So we know what it's all about. But it's the same; everybody's got at least one of these, so we just suck it up. We go on the road and take care of business, and we get a little break.""

Porter is expected to be the Bucks' starting point guard, and is just one of two players on the 2025-26 roster to average 2.9 assists or more.

He began as a backup but then wrestled the starting job away from Keyonte George, who was an All-Rookie selection the year prior. Collier really hit his stride towards the end of the season and averaged 15.9 points and 7.1 assists over his final seven games of his rookie year. Already one of the league's youngest teams, Utah then jettisoned vets Jordan Clarkson, Collin Sexton and John Collins in the offseason as it has fully embraced a youth movement. Thus, the 21-year-old Collier should have no shortage of opportunities, and he plays in an offense conducive for lots of stats. The Jazz ranked fifth in pace last season as they want to utilize those young legs to their advantage. The model slots Collier ahead of Klay Thompson and Jalen Suggs, despite those two being drafted earlier on average. Identify other Fantasy basketball breakouts 2025 here . Top 2025 Fantasy basketball busts As for players to avoid, the model lists Pelicans guard Jordan Poole as a Fantasy basketball bust. Poole was one of the major pieces in a trade between the Wizards and Pelicans in the offseason. The 26-year-old now goes to New Orleans, where he'll have to be a bit more of a complimentary player to Zion Williamson. New Orleans also brings in two lottery picks -- Derik Queen and Jeremiah Fears -- so Poole could lose some of his scoring opportunities as the season progresses. Poole is being picked in the seventh round, according to the latest ADP, but SportsLine's model has players such as Jrue Holiday and Immanuel Quickly, both of whom are being picked later, as better values. Avoid these 2025 Fantasy basketball busts as well .

7fd1a71f4ab6,Hot seats blaze as coaching carousel resets: Nine FBS jobs open at midseason with more coming soon,"college football hot seats, college coach hot seats, college football coach firings, college football coaching carousel, college coaching carousel, billy napier contract, luke fickell contract, james franklin contract","There is little doubt throughout the coaching industry from administrators, agents, and college football coaches themselves that the 2025 coaching cycle is setting up to be unprecedented. There are already nine open jobs, including seven that have opened midseason, and more are expected to pop soon. You rarely get more than a couple changes before Halloween in a normal year. This is the first year since the FBS era began in 1978 that seven or more jobs have opened before November, according to CBS Sports researchers. Last year saw 30 jobs change, but only five Power Four jobs among them. This cycle will be similar to 2021, when LSU and USC fired coaches early in the cycle -- leading to serious downstream effects. We've already seen one of college football's bluest of blue bloods open in Penn State , which has only had four total coaches since 1950. Industry sources are bracing for as many 40 jobs to open, especially given the likelihood of head coaches getting poached for jobs like Penn State or UCLA. College football coaching carousel tracker: Grades, analysis on coach changes, 2025-26 firings and hirings Brandon Marcello In addition to the coaches fighting for their jobs and the many disruptions to the industry that will come via coaches moving jobs, there's another category that could shake the carousel -- retirements. All of it comes together for a cycle that in the words of one source is ""about to get f***** wild."" CBS Sports surveyed sources around the country to paint a picture of just where the coaching carousel sits halfway through the season with so much already spinning. Hot seat scale on jobs that could come open Note: Schools listed by degree of heat (the more flames, the hotter the seat) which can of course swing swing by the week. Billy Napier's been perpetually on the hot seat for almost 18 months at this point. A 1-3 start did him no favors. The Gators have a winnable game at home this weekend against Mississippi State ahead of their bye week, but a bye week is an opportune time to make a change, win or lose. Of note, Napier would be owed around $20 million if fired with half of that due within 30 days, per his contract. In the words of one industry source: ""The job I'm hearing is the hottest is Wisconsin."" Luke Fickell is in his third year and is 15-17 at Wisconsin, a program that didn't post a losing season between 2002 and 2023. Fickell's buyout is sizable at around $25 million, and is a concern sources have brought up. However, unlike with Napier, Fickell would be paid out monthly through 2032. Wisconsin has games with Ohio State and Oregon over the next two weeks ahead of its bye week. Tim Beck picked up a needed win last week over ULM, but industry sources continue to point to Coastal as a job that could open. Coastal's athletic director, Chance Miller , did not hire Beck, and Beck's record over the last two years is just 9-10. As several have written about before, Jay Norvell has not received a contract extension with just one year left on his deal after this season. That's a sign change could come as it's rare for coaches to work under that type of uncertainty. Industry sources continue to circle this job as one that's trending toward coming open after the Rams' 2-4 start. Auburn 🔥🔥🔥🔥 With Auburn in the midst of a three-game losing streak, industry sources have pointed to Hugh Freeze's seat as getting warmer by the week. ""If they lose the next two, I think he's out,"" one source said. ""The pressure is real. I don't think they want to do it. I think he's coaching for his job. Back against the wall."" Athletic director John Cohen delivered a tacit vote of confidence when he said that a coaching change is ""not my expectation at this point."" When asked whether or not he expects Freeze to be Auburn's head coach in 2026, Cohen said he has a ""never say never"" attitude, and used a metaphor about a car not starting to explain his thought process. ""I don't know if I'm going to walk outside and my car is going to start or not, I think it is,"" Cohen said. ""I have an expectation it will. But if my car doesn't start enough, then I will evaluate that and make decisions about my car. But that's not my expectation at this point about our football program."" Florida State 🔥🔥🔥 The heat is starting to turn back up on Mike Norvell after the goodwill he created with a 3-0 start. Recent losses to Virginia and Pittsburgh have kicked up the hornet's nest again. But the reality is Norvell would be owed around $58 million if he were to be fired. As one industry source put it: ""That's a lot of money, man."" Especially so at a place like FSU that's been trying to find ways to generate more revenue. Still, it's a job worth monitoring as the season continues. Things have gone sideways in Lexington the last two seasons. Mark Stoops suffered his first non-COVID losing season since 2016 last year, and the Wildcats are off to a 2-3 start in 2025 with a brutal schedule ahead. Still, Stoops does have a fair amount of protection via his contract. The winningest head coach in program history, Stoops' buyout is close to $38 million and it would be owed in a lump sum within 60 days. That's a lot of money for an athletics department that just took $141 million in loans from the university to offset stadium renovation costs and as a cash infusion to offset a budgetary deficit. One of the toughest jobs in the entire FBS, Joe Moorehead is just 10-33 in four seasons with the Zips. Many in the industry speculate that Moorhead could eventually leave Akron and take an offensive coordinator job elsewhere. Of note, Moorhead's youngest child, Donovan, is a high school senior and is committed to play quarterback at Jacksonville State . If we had to place North Carolina in a flame meter discussion, truthfully it would be 2.5 out of five. Last week's theatrics are emblematic of the lack of alignment that underscored Bill Belichick's hire in the first place. Things are not going well in Chapel Hill, where the Tar Heels have one of the worst rosters in the Power Four. Bill Belichick shuts down buyout talk, focused on winning at North Carolina: 'It's a learning curve' Brad Crawford Belichick addressed the rumors in a press conference on Monday. ""Reports about my looking for a buyout or trying to leave here is categorically false,"" Belichick said. ""There's zero truth to any of that. I'm glad I'm here."" A safe landing? While many jobs are heating up at the midway point of the season, the seats of several coaches have cooled considerably thanks to strong starts. Arizona Brent Brennan's seat was warm coming into his second season following a 4-8 debut that saw the Wildcats lose all the momentum they had generated under Jedd Fisch. But the Wildcats have gotten off to a strong start this season at 4-2 with plenty of opportunities to pick up wins down the stretch. Conversations around that job have cooled considerably. California In the ACC there was some scuttle that Cal head coach Justin Wilcox could be in trouble after five straight losing seasons and an offseason of roster losses. But the Bears look resurgent at 4-2 and have a building block for the future in true freshman quarterback Jaron-Keawe Sagapolutele . Cincinnati There was a lot of pressure on Scott Satterfield entering this year after back-to-back losing seasons with the Bearcats. But thanks to strong portal classes and internal development, the Bearcats have raced out to 5-1 and look like a burgeoning Big 12 contender. Louisiana Tech Coach Sonny Cumbie may have had the hottest seat in the country entering the year, but that's cooled thanks to the Bulldogs' 4-2 record. Louisiana Tech did suffer a bad 35-7 loss to Kennesaw State over the weekend, though, so it's not like Cumbie is totally safe. Latest on open jobs Arkansas Athletic director Hunter Yurachek said last month that the program was not set up to win a championship in football and a clear vision for future resources is a must. One personnel executive questioned Arkansas' front office setup with an overarching general manager with a basketball background, Remy Cofield, overseeing negotiations for multiple sports. Arkansas has multiple mouths to feed resource wise as John Calipari will expect ammunition to build on a Sweet 16 debut season, and baseball is also a significant concern to the school's fanbase. The obvious name is Rhett Lashlee, a Springdale, Arkansas native and Razorback alum. He will certainly have support, including from Dallas Cowboys owner and Jerry Jones. For Lashlee to consider it, however, Arkansas will have to prove that it has resources that would entice Lashlee away from an SMU job with nearly unlimited resources. Industry sources have indicated other jobs that could come open this cycle are far more likely to tempt Lashlee than Arkansas. Lashlee is also said to be quite happy at SMU, a school that's given him almost everything necessary to compete in the ACC. Sources told CBS Sports the current Arkansas football roster is worth around $14 million in revenue share and NIL combined, which is considered on the very low end of the SEC resource wise. Parker Search firm is assisting Arkansas' search and sources expect a sitting head coach to be the first place Hogs look with North Texas head coach Eric Morris and USF's Alex Golesh also potentially in play among others. ""I think they're all over the place. I think they've got a top two to three but they're all over the place outside the top three,"" an industry source said. There is also, obviously, the matter of interim head coach Bobby Petrino, who will certainly have his supporters. The length of this interim tenure (seven games) offers a true trial run for Petrino to prove if he still has what it takes to be a big-time college football coach and win over a fanbase divided over him as the head hog. If Petrino ends up with the job permanently one of two things likely happened: Best case is Arkansas shocks some combination of their remaining opponents (Texas A&M, Auburn, Mississippi State, LSU, Texas, and Missouri) or worst case, nobody Arkansas deems worth hiring actually wanted the job. Out of 136 FBS head coach jobs, Kent State is annually in the running to be the very worst. Interim head coach Mark Carney has been at the helm since the offseason firing of Kenni Burns, and multiple industry sources had little clarity about where Kent State was at in the process even with its sizable head start on the rest of its peers in the bottom rung of the sport. Even though Kent State announced its intent to do a full search when he was named Carney the interim, it's unclear where they would turn to as many in the industry view it as a dead end. There's a chance the interim tag gets removed if the Golden Flashes can find a way to squeak out a couple wins in the MAC. Beavers athletic director Scott Barnes has been an AD at multiple stops and promoted Trent Bray, a former OSU linebacker, to permanent head coach in 2024 after an interim spell. He was frank about Bray's limitations after firing him after OSU began the season 0-7 . ""The difference between those hires and this one was Trent didn't embrace the enterprise as a whole,"" Barnes told John Canzano . ""The CEO seat and the enterprise and the tough decisions. All coordinators are a work and progress but you see an appetite for wanting to take on the tough decisions, wanting to command the enterprise, and I didn't see that."" There is an open question from industry sources about whether Barnes will be in his post longterm. Oregon State has funding issues as an athletic department as one of the two teams left behind in the Pac-12's implosion, not to mention dwindling contributions from its state government (a growing concern for universities nationwide). There is also an open question as to the fairness of its deal with NIL marketing agency Blueprint sports . Whoever takes the job, as usual for the Beavers, will have to do more with less and middle-of-the-road resources in the new-look Pac-12. One name floated by sources is Montana State head coach Brent Vigen. The Cowboys are conducting a head coaching search in football for the first time since 2004 when Les Miles left the program for LSU and the program promoted a 38-year-old Mike Gundy to the head job. There are questions as to whether athletics director Chad Weiberg would make the next hire given he's been working without a contract since June. But sources indicate he's expected to soon sign an extension and is fronting the search. Weiberg is getting assistance from the search firm TurnkeyZRG. Whoever is the next head coach will have to invest more in the current era of NIL and rev share. Gundy said earlier this year the Cowboys had only spent ""around $7 million"" over the last three years on its roster. A common complaint among the Cowboys' brass was Gundy's unwillingness to embrace both NIL and the transfer portal. As for candidates to know, there's overlap with the Arkansas job, another program with a similar geographic profile. Industry sources have indicated names like Texas State head coach GJ Kinne, UTSA head coach Jeff Traylor and potentially even Oklahoma offensive coordinator Ben Arbuckle should be on the radar along with rising Group of Six coaches like Ryan Silverfield and Alex Golesh. But other names have been linked heavily with this job in talking with sources. One is Morris, who will be a candidate for multiple jobs this cycle. The other two are both Oklahoma State alumni. Multiple sources have linked Atlanta Falcons offensive coordinator Zac Robinson with the Cowboys. Robinson is a former Oklahoma State quarterback and has been an on-the-rise name in NFL circles for years. Said one source of the search: ""That's who I think is getting the job."" Robinson hasn't coached in college, however, and it's not quite clear he'd be willing to leave the NFL for college football. The other alumnus to know is Purdue offensive coordinator Josh Henson. A lineman for the Cowboys in the 90s who's made multiple stops with the program as an assistant, Henson is a popular name among Oklahoma State's booster class and is gaining some traction. A quote to note from Weiberg's press conference in the wake of Gundy's firing: ""We're not going to be afraid to talk to people who are assistant coaches."" Penn State The Nittany Lions sent a shockwave through the college football world when AD Pat Kraft fired James Franklin on Sunday in a decision that came together rapidly after Saturday's loss to Northwestern (the second loss in a row as a 20+ point favorite). When asked before the Northwestern game about Franklin's job security, one industry source said ""if they don't make the playoff, let's have this conversation again."" The reason many were surprised was due to the massive price tag of Franklin's approximately $48 million buyout. Kraft declined to go into any specifics of the financials of Franklin's buyout, and Penn State is not compelled to release Franklin's full contract under Pennsylvania public records laws. According to Front Office Sports , Franklin has a duty to mitigate clause in his contract. The clause, which is standard in college head coaching contracts, states that Franklin must actively seek new employment. If he gets it, the buyout owed to him is offset by his new salary. The Buyout Bubble: Why college football keeps paying millions to make coaches disappear Brandon Marcello Speaking to sources across the industry, the name that comes up in any conversation about Penn State is Nebraska head coach Matt Rhule. The 50-year-old is a Penn State alumnus and is close to Kraft, who hired him at Temple in 2012. Rhule didn't exactly tamp down any Penn State speculation with his initial comments on the job earlier this week: ""(Nebraska) is elite. And I want to be a great father, and I want to be a great college football coach. And so I'm not going to talk a lot about job openings when they come."" Outside of the obvious connections between Rhule and the Nittany Lions, many conversations with industry sources didn't stray too much from a list any common message board fan could put together due to the timing of Franklin's firing. Though, names like Curt Cignetti, Matt Campbell, Clark Lea, Manny Diaz, Eli Drinkwitz, Alex Golesh and even Urban Meyer have come up in conversations. General manager Andrew Luck is at the helm for a search that will serve as his official stamp on the future of Stanford football. Industry sources differ on the expected impact his father, Oliver, will have on the search. Some say the former West Virginia AD is a de facto co-leader of the search, while another termed his as more of a confidant -- which makes sense if your father had run double-digit executive hiring processes. Stanford recently announced a $50 million influx into the football program by a donor which made headlines, but when asked if the funds are immediately accessible in full, a Stanford spokesperson told CBS Sports that some of it is and ""some of it is pledged over time."" The spokesperson was unable to provide a breakdown of how much of the money can be used now and in the future. It is not expected that Stanford will relax admissions standards for football players in the future and it is almost certain that Luck's search will end up being wide ranging, including NFL assistant coaches like the Commanders' Tavita Pritchard or Troy Walters and former NFL assistants like current Maryland OC Pep Hamilton. UAB Another unclear AD situation lies in Birmingham where Mark Ingram remains in the job after firing Trent Dilfer. ""Ingram took a risk with Dilfer, it might cost him his job,"" an industry source said. UAB president Ray Watts is not considered deeply involved in athletics, and any move on Ingram would likely come from the school's board of trustees. One name floated for the job is SMU offensive coordinator Casey Woods, who was once an assistant. Another is ULM head coach Bryant Vincent, who is also interim AD for the Warhawks and was formerly interim head coach of the Blazers. There is potential, if Ingram is no longer in the job, to reunite with former head coach Bill Clark as well. UCLA The tenor around UCLA has changed considerably in recent weeks following back-to-back wins over Penn State and Michigan State . Interim head coach Tim Skipper is 2-1 and offensive coordinator Jerry Neuheisel, the son of former Bruins head coach Rick Neuheisel, might be the most popular person on that campus. Whether Skipper is given a real opportunity to get the job remains to be seen. Skipper, 47, served as Fresno State's interim head coach last year and many in the industry expected him to get the full-time job. But a 6-7 finish sunk any chance he had. Could Skipper change his fate a year later? Industry sources are skeptical, but if Skipper continues to win he may force the administration's hands. UCLA's search effort is fronted by athletic director Martin Jarmond and senior associate athletics director Erin Adkins, the same pair who led the abrupt 2023 search that led to DeShuan Foster. That pair will be assisted by a committee that is fronted by entertainment executive Casey Wasserman, former Warriors GM Bob Myers, former NFL pro Eric Kendricks and current Washington Commanders GM Adam Peters, each of whom are Bruin alums. There is considerable industry doubt as to UCLA's investment in football. The Bruins have lagged considerably behind other Big Ten programs in NIL investment the last few seasons, per multiple sources, but the Bruins brass has indicated there will be additional investment for the new regime. UCLA has already begun its initial round of conversations with potential candidates, per a source. Preliminary names that have come up early as possibilities include Washington's Jedd Fisch, North Texas' Morris, UNLV's Dan Mullen, Arizona's Brent Brennan and New Mexico's Jason Eck among others. Sources have indicated Florida State defensive coordinator Tony White, an alumnus who's been in the mix for multiple head jobs over the last few years, is interested. But the UCLA admin has communicated to agents that they'd prefer to hire a sitting head coach. Quick note with Mullen: The 53-year-old, who is off to a 6-0 start, strongly denied interest in any other jobs when asked at a recent press conference. ""Listen, I'll make it real simple. Want me to do that? I'm going to be the head coach at UNLV next year,"" Mullen said . The Hokies' search committee includes former coaches Bruce Arians and Bud Foster in addition to former player Eddie Royal and multiple alums from the business world. The search had a bit of a false start when Arians went on the Pat McAfee Show and said the school was ""going to hire a general manager and get him in charge of football"" before they ""get into the coaching search"" in late September. The Hokies have since walked that back, according to athletic director Whit Babcock, who is not leading the search, but assisting it. That is due to feedback Virginia Tech received that its candidate pool would be limited if it took a GM-first hiring approach. His longterm future in the job is a very open question according to industry sources as Virginia Tech looks to re-do its entire athletic department, including hiring a CEO-type leader of the department to modernize a department that multiple industry sources called ""outdated."" The Hokies are expected to start with sitting head coaches and then go from there, and have their own budgetary concerns. Recently, the school's board of rectors greenlit a $229.2 million infusion of funds over the next four years, with $47.1 million coming next year, and approximately $61 million in the next three years. But when looking into the funding sources, $30 million each year are due to come from fundraising efforts , which implies that the funds are not already on hand at the university. Requests for comment by CBS Sports from multiple members of the board charged with designing the budget were not returned, but Babcock said on a school-produced podcast he is confident the athletic department can secure the funds. ""We certainly have a high degree of confidence that we will operate with the additional $47.1 million budget resources committed to us this fiscal year and the out years too."" Babcock said athletics will be able to use fundraising staffers from the university side, which raised $225 million last year. Don't expect much more public comments from the search committee as it was reported the committee signed non-disclosure agreements and will no longer be speaking about it . But industry sources do not discount the possibility of a return by South Carolina head coach Shane Beamer to Blacksburg, where his father's legacy looms large. Asked about his possible interest in the Virginia Tech job in September, Beamer said : ""I think the week of the Virginia Tech game, I told everyone how I feel about South Carolina and my love for this place. That's where my focus is at right now, just getting our football team better.""",https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/news/hot-seat-rumors-coaching-carousel-updates-florida-billy-napier-wisconsin-luke-fickell-penn-state-james-franklin,Sport,cbssports.com,,https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2025/10/15/c3fd0232-6d05-4c36-9ad1-5655cce97bbd/thumbnail/1200x675/ad91ab477ef911a912b5e72fd55936ab/cfb-splice.png,2025-10-15T18:59:00+00:00,2359e19c009753eb018d24f50f5c5a6921e30f58

6cb1d242c0e6,"Mariners vs. Blue Jays odds, ALCS Game 3 pick: Best bets as Cal Raleigh and Co. look to go up 3-0",,"The first four games of the LCS round in the 2025 MLB playoffs saw the road team win every game, meaning the Mariners and Dodgers go home with a 2-0 lead. The chances of a comeback for the Blue Jays and Brewers feel pretty bleak. We saw a team come back from an 0-2 deficit in 2023, so we're pretty aware it can be done. That Diamondbacks team was going home, though, while the Brewers head to Los Angeles and the Blue Jays will be in Seattle. The Mariners were 51-30 at home this season. They lost Game 1 last round, though. The pitching matchup for Game 3 of the Blue Jays-Mariners ALCS -- the long game on Wednesday's schedule -- is Shane Bieber against George Kirby . In terms of picking, nothing really seems all too enticing. The Mariners feel more likely to win and are favored at -132. I'm not just sure enough to play that side with that juice. The total at 7 runs is perfectly placed. We'll just zero in on player props, via DraftKings , riding the hot hand. Kirby is a strike-thrower who can be squared up. He lets his defense and home ballpark do some work for him, but will also pile up some strikeouts. Springer is aggressive enough early in the count that he will have the chance to do a little damage. He's coming off a regular season in which he averaged almost 2.5 hits plus runs plus RBI per game (154 hits, 106 runs, 84 RBI in 140 games). He's been over 1.5 in this prop four of the six playoff games this season so far. The leadoff man has scored six runs in six games and is a good bet to be the first Blue Jays' run scored. Also, for anyone putting stock in the small-sample that is head-to-head matchups, he's 3 for 8 (.375) with a double in his career against Kirby. Everyone should know plenty about Raleigh by now. He had 147 hits, 110 runs and 125 RBI in the regular season (2.4 per game combined). He's hit this prop six of his seven playoff games so far and has at least one hit in six of the seven playoff games as well. He didn't get a hit for the first time in Game 2 of the ALCS, but he walked twice and came around to score both times, giving us a nice idea at how he could win this bet if the Blue Jays try to pitch around him. And, of course, one home run cashes us instantly. Even in this tough ballpark, 28 of Raleigh's 60 regular-season home runs happened in T-Mobile Park. Bieber has struggled since his first two starts with the Jays, too.",https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/news/mariners-vs-blue-jays-odds-alcs-game-3-pick-best-bets-as-cal-raleigh-and-co-look-to-go-up-3-0,Sport,cbssports.com,,https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2025/10/15/afc7e53c-9bb0-4256-b43e-3448d8526f09/thumbnail/1200x675/e122c0c982a49713fd40ea2a84c1f523/cal-raleigh-getty.png,2025-10-15T18:52:25+00:00,39576a734906069ce45c249936adf7e2a3555abb
ebb82af3e5d9,Kings remain directionless with Russell Westbrook signing: How Sacramento can escape pit of mediocrity,,"After losing to the Golden State Warriors in an intense seven-game playoff series back in 2023, it seemed like the Sacramento Kings had finally escaped the mediocrity that surrounded the franchise for the better part of the last decade. The Kings broke the longest playoff drought in North American sports, finished with the No. 1 offensive rating in NBA history (at the time), and finally, for once, had a clear direction with Mike Brown as coach and De'Aaron Fox and Domantas Sabonis as co-stars. Since that moment, most of the transactions the franchise has made -- highlighted most recently by the signing of former league MVP Russell Westbrook on Wednesday -- are more signs that Sacramento is heading in the wrong direction with a roster that lacks balance and makes no sense. A metaphor to describe Sacramento's current roster -- that has an influx of guards and very little playable forwards -- is to think of your local all-you-can-eat buffet, which probably serves a variety of cuisines. Sure, on the surface, having all the food options you could imagine sounds amazing, but would cheese pizza really pair well with seafood? Probably not. And that's exactly what Sacramento's current roster is -- a bunch of dishes that could make sense individually (in this case, on different teams), but paired together would make your stomach turn. The on-court product has a similar senetiment. Kings sign Russell Westbrook: Former league MVP heads to seventh different team for 2025-26 season Cameron Salerno Westbrook is approaching the twilight of his career. There is no denying he has had his moments -- for better or worse -- while playing for five different teams since 2019. Westbrook is still a good leader and someone who can provide a spark off the bench, but does he really make sense for a team that has a logjam of guards already? Sacramento entered this offseason without a true point guard on the roster, which, to Westbrook's credit, he still is. The Kings signed Dennis Schröder to a three-year deal after a sign-and-trade with the Detroit Pistons , which ended up dragging along during the start of free agency because Sacramento had strong reported interest in restricted free agent Jonathan Kuminga . But with Westbrook, Schröder, Malik Monk , DeMar DeRozan and Zach LaVine -- the headliner in the trade that sent Fox to the San Antonio Spurs at last season's trade deadline -- the Kings have a team built to compete for a play-in berth instead of looking in the mirror, having the uncomfortable conversation about how everyone fits together on the roster and developing the young talent the franchise has. Sacramento is +185 ( on FanDuel ) to make the Play-In Tournament. The Kings have the sixth-best odds to make the play-in behind the Spurs, Mavericks , Grizzlies , Lakers and Warriors. So, what direction should Sacramento take? Going back to the winter of 2022 -- before that season's trade deadline -- the Kings had a logjam of point guards on the team, with Tyrese Haliburton , Davion Mitchell and Fox on the roster. The fit of Haliburton and Fox never quite worked out. It was part of the reason why the front office could stomach trading Halliburton to the Indiana Pacers for Domantas Sabonis because Sacramento believed he could elevate their offense while serving as the playmaking hub, which he did during the 2022-23 season. The problem, however, dating back to the playoff loss in 2023, is that the Kings failed to make the big swing under former general manager Monte McNair. The Kings were linked to various trade targets in recent years, including OG Anunoby , Pascal Siakam , Lauri Markkanen , Alex Caruso and more. All of those names would've filled a clear need at the wing next to Keegan Murray , who is now set to miss at least the next four to six weeks after undergoing surgery on his thumb. It's part of the reason why the Houston Rockets ' big swing on trading for Kevin Durant was so admirable. After catching lightning in a bottle and having a remarkable turnaround en route to the No. 2 seed in the Western Conference, Houston parlayed that by making a substantial upgrade to its roster that puts the franchise in a position to make a run at the title this season. Without Murray, the Kings don't have a serviceable starting-level replacement on the roster. Sure, you can play DeRozan or even rookie Nique Clifford -- who was a star during summer league -- at the four, but both players would be undersized and overmatched for their respective matchups on a given night. That's part of the reason why Sacramento this offseason was reportedly so infatuated with the idea of pairing Murray with Kuminga in the frontcourt. Sacramento would have two forwards to build around who would complement each other's skill sets. Kuminga, who is eligible to be traded by the Golden State Warriors on Jan. 15, 2026, would've been the youngest player on Sacramento's roster. The direction Sacramento should take is a simple one that owner Vivek Ranadivé has shown he is not willing to do since buying the team in 2013: rebuild. The 2026 NBA Draft is loaded at the top, and the Kings (outside of a 2031 pick swap with the Spurs) have all their future firsts. There are three players in particular worth keeping an eye on: BYU's AJ Dybantsa, Kansas' Darryn Peterson and Duke's Cameron Boozer. Even outside of that, Tennessee's Nate Ament and Louisville's Mikel Brown Jr. look worth losing for. All of those players would give Sacramento a true building block and clear direction heading into the 2026-27 season and beyond. However, the signing of Westbrook signals the Kings aren't ready to take that necessary step to one day return to the playoffs. Instead of playing former first-round pick Devin Carter , soon-to-be free agent Keon Ellis , Clifford, Murray and other young pieces on the roster substantial minutes, they will likely be relegated to smaller roles with the veterans taking the front seat toward a berth in the play-in. Signing Westbrook for the minimum isn't the problem at the end of the day. In fact, most of the moves Sacramento made to put itself in this position in the first place were by (current Kings general manager) Scott Perry's predecessor. Perry, who has experience rebuilding rosters, once again finds himself behind the eight ball with an expensive roster that lacks a clear identity. With one week until the Kings begin their season against the Phoenix Suns , Sacramento has a roster that makes no sense -- with no clear resolution in sight. If Ranadivé's goal is to fill the arena by adding big-ticket players, then signing Westbrook accomplishes the mission and fulfills the shortsided vision.",https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/kings-remain-directionless-with-russell-westbrook-signing-how-sacramento-can-escape-pit-of-mediocrity,Sport,cbssports.com,,https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2025/10/15/1152d207-42eb-432b-aec3-68387097ac7c/thumbnail/1200x675/0bf38d5579668f72aa450e6c5e7853e2/untitled-design-52.png,2025-10-15T18:50:20+00:00,41b8e0989e7a0ecf5274ca8e633ced9af0654bf1

4d0989832131,Patriots' Drake Maye elite? How QB has played his way into MVP discussion; how high is New England's ceiling?,"drake maye, nfl mvp, qb tiers, patriots, new england patriots, afc east","You can always tell when the game slows down for a younger player. Their movements become more controlled, processing becomes quicker and everything just moves in slow motion. Neo becoming The One in The Matrix , Midorya realizing the full extent of his powers in My Hero Academia, both are examples of when you could tell that the game really slowed down for them. You can now add New England Patriots ' QB Drake Maye into that conversation. The New England Patriots are 4-2 and sit at the top of the AFC East, and Maye's exponential growth from last season to this one is the biggest reason why. You can look for any metric and Maye is at or near the top of the list: seventh in EPA per play, eighth in Passing Success Rate, fifth in passing yards and tied for ninth in passing touchdowns. All of this in a year where the offense hasn't fully realized its potential yet, with a sporadic run game and pass protection that has been up and down. Yet, Maye has this offense top 10 in EPA per play and en route to a playoff push. How he's been able to make the leap from promising to legitimately great this year has been really fun, and it all starts with slowing the game down. The Patriots, despite not having an offense that's necessarily chock full of dynamic playmakers, is built to more maximize Maye's effectiveness as a downfield passer this year compared to 2024. With offensive coordinator Josh McDaniels at the helm, Maye's aggression throwing the ball deep has been unleashed. According to Next Gen Stats, Maye is tied for the third most completions of passes over 20 Air Yards this season and has a blistering +33.1% Completion Percentage Over Expected, second-highest in the NFL behind Sam Darnold . McDaniels is an old-school offensive designer; the Patriots play 12 personnel on 37.08% of their plays this season, sixth-highest in the NFL. When they get into heavy looks and throw the ball deep, Maye is more than capable of putting in the launch codes downfield. However, what makes him even more dangerous on these plays is the fact that his ball placement is pristine. PFF charts him with zero turnover-worthy plays on passes over 20 air yards. His ability to throw 40-yard handoffs is what separates him from the pack, and that growth has been evident this season. Maye's downfield aggression is something that traveled with him from 2024, but I think his ball placement on those deep passes has trended upwards as well. Even on passes that were called back due to ghost OPI calls or passes just off the fingertips of WRs like Mack Hollins , Maye is putting them in the bucket, maximizing a wide receiver corps that doesn't necessarily have a dominant threat on the outside. WR Kayshon Boutte has been the Pats' best jump ball receiver this year, which is a testament to his growth but also Maye putting passes in the only spot that he could for his guy to go get. That's not just top tier quarterbacking, it's darn near MVP level. Where Maye truly has entered the matrix is when it comes to avoiding pressure and what he does in the face of it. I always thought he was better against pressure than most gave him credit for, but without any supporting cast in 2024, his pressure numbers were abysmal: per Sumer Sports, his EPA per dropback last year under pressure was -0.22, 21st in the NFL. Through six games this year, Maye has completely flipped his fortunes: his 0.09 EPA per play under pressure is now up at fifth in the entire league. Where I think he's improved the most under pressure is his understanding of what works and what doesn't for him, his answers against pressure. QBs can beat pressure with any combination of their arm, legs or mind. Patrick Mahomes this year has chosen to beat pressure with his legs, to the tune of leading the Kansas City Chiefs in rushing yards. Where Maye is winning is through his arm and legs, creating space within the pocket while keeping his eyes downfield and generating explosive passes. Maye is second in the NFL in passing touchdowns under pressure, and a large part of that is because of his ability to keep his eyes downfield and make movements to create space for himself to get passes off. Maye can scramble to get first downs, but what I've been the most impressed with is the ability to gash defenses downfield under pressure. With the deep ball and accuracy downfield to strike fear into opponents and the pocket movement to maximize his abilities, he's raised the floor and ceiling of the Pats offense. In their win against the New Orleans Saints , all three of Maye's touchdown passes came under pressure, on plays where he keeps his eyes up and throws strikes downfield. I love Maye's ability to keep the ball tight to his body when moving up in the pocket, and then the off platform throw to move the chains on 3rd down is big boy quarterbacking. This is what some of the best in the business do, and Maye is playing at that level to start the season. However, it's not only the way the game has slowed down for Maye. He's getting through his progressions much quicker, and his ability to keep the offense on schedule without a run game to really speak of has been incredibly impressive. He's trimmed most of the fat off of his footwork and has been able to make a lot of plays just based on how quick he's getting through progressions. Through the first six games of the season, it's safe to say that Maye has arrived as an upper echelon NFL QB. Maye has the Patriots dreaming of the playoffs for the first time in four years. His growth as a passer, while still maximizing the strengths he came in with has helped New England become a top passing offense in the NFL. How high Maye can get remains to be seen, but someone so young shouldn't be this good, and it's making for a fun watch.",https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/patriots-drake-maye-elite-how-qb-has-played-his-way-into-mvp-discussion-how-high-is-new-englands-ceiling,Sport,cbssports.com,,https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2025/10/02/1698b2b5-c9f7-4ddb-be20-9413473539d3/thumbnail/1200x675/53ce4813d7a1dc529426d3801c03010a/drake-maye.jpg,2025-10-15T18:45:10+00:00,67c2c403c0d96576efc9e80f3086045d5d3e826d
1abd46968fbe,"Jaguars, Travis Hunter reveal keys to getting the No. 2 overall pick more involved on offense",,"When trying to solve any issue, one of the first steps is identifying possible solutions. For the Jaguars and Travis Hunter , both parties know the keys to getting the No. 2 overall pick more involved in the offense. Through six games, the Jaguars' rookie dual threat has caught 20 of 31 targets for 197 yards. He is still looking for his first touchdown entering Jacksonville's Week 7 showdown with the Rams in London. ""Scheming him open is part of it, No. 1,"" Jaguars coach Liam Coen said. Coen added that the Jaguars are prioritizing getting Hunter more involved in the offense. ""Our job as an offensive staff [is] to make sure we're putting him in the progression and putting him in the position to be No. 1 [option] a little bit more often in some ways. And then when he is the primary [option], we've got to throw and catch. We've got to make sure that we identify it, find him, be able to be at the right spot at the right time. So, I think it's a combination of a lot of those things that ultimately can all be controlled."" While he hasn't been overly involved in the offense, Hunter has made an impact when he has gotten the ball. During the Jaguars' Week 5 over the Chiefs , Hunter caught each of his three targets for a season-high 64 yards. He made a nifty 44-yard catch early in the second half that led to Trevor Lawrence's game-tying touchdown run. Later in the game, Hunter caught an eight-yard pass that set up Cam Little's 52-yard field goal that gave the Jaguars their first lead in an eventual 31-28 win. It's important to note that Hunter is being asked to contribute on both sides of the ball, something that hasn't been done at a high level in the NFL since his college coach -- Deion Sanders -- did so roughly 30 years ago with the Cowboys . Sanders, however, never caught more than 36 passes in a season; Hunter is currently on pace to catch 57 passes. While Coen and the Jaguars' coaching staff know what they have to do, Hunter is also aware of the things he can do to increase his productivity as a receiver. ""It is very important for me to be patient,"" Hunter said. ""Just got to let the game come to me. Coach is trying to dial up a couple things for me, and I've just got to continue to just work and just having the guys trust me because I'm doing my job every time.""",https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/jaguars-travis-hunter-reveal-keys-to-getting-the-no-2-overall-pick-more-involved-on-offense,Sport,cbssports.com,,https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2025/10/15/02c0f5aa-399c-427f-882b-6c29ec08348d/thumbnail/1200x675/4021e0ae2ca43e8160a29800e645a963/travishunterweek6.jpg,2025-10-15T18:43:16+00:00,27638a9fcb5c6ef1b0789ddff7aa9b8967715be4
fa65dc1b1ace,Rashee Rice is back -- and his return could change everything for the Chiefs' offense and fantasy managers,,"It was doom and gloom for the Kansas City Chiefs through the first two weeks of the regular season. The franchise dropped to 0-2 as murmurs of the dynasty's demise began to spread, but it has since landed on its feet again. After throttling the Detroit Lions in Week 6, K.C. is suddenly back to .500 on the year -- a game behind both the Chargers and Broncos for first place in the AFC West -- and the offense is getting a substantial boost with the return of Rashee Rice . The standout receiver has finished serving his six-game suspension and will make his season debut in Week 7 when Kansas City hosts the Las Vegas Raiders at Arrowhead Stadium. This will be Rice's first game since Week 4 of last season, when knee and hamstring injuries led to season-ending surgery. With that injury and this suspension behind him, Rice could be an X-factor in the overall landscape of the AFC , as the 2023 third-round pick has shown flashes of being a true No. 1 receiver when he's been on the field. What the Chiefs are saying about Rashee Rice's return Andy Reid to reporters on Monday on Rashee Rice's role upon his return: ""Listen, I know he's been working like crazy. The rule states that we can't work with him, but I know he's been working out hard. I think it's just a matter of getting him back in the swing. I've got to see it to kind of work through it, but I know he's in good shape; that's the one thing I do know. I think that'll be important, him coming back in there, getting him with Patrick, kind of getting them on the same page, and that whole deal. We'll see how all that works out. We haven't put the game plan in yet, so we're working through all that now."" Andy Reid to reporters on Wednesday on Rashee Rice returning to practice this week: ""Yeah, I think he's excited to get going. I think getting through practices here will be good for him. Kind of get back into the swing of things. We'll see how everything goes from there, but he's been working hard and he's in good shape."" Patrick Mahomes to reporters on Wednesday on Rashee Rice rejoining an offense and his workload expectations: ""We've gotten better and better. Adding a guy like Xavier [Worthy] back and then Rashee back, we'll just continue to hopefully improve what we can do. All you can ask for is to get better each and every week, and I feel like we're doing that."" ""He's going to want to be out there on every single play. That's just the mentality that he has. I think it's going to be our job as teammates and coaches to kind of build him back the right way, but it's going to be hard to keep him off the field for sure."" Xavier Worthy to reporters on Wednesday on getting Rashee Rice back in the receiver room and what he does for the offense : ""Rashee's our guy. Like Coach Reid said, the room's really close, so just having him back in the building is good to have him around. ... He's just another threat. Everybody eats. It's more eyes going on somebody else. I feel like everybody in this offense can make a play and go win on one-on-ones, so it's just another explosive guy in this offense."" How the offense will improve with Rashee Rice in the fold We cannot overstate how good Rice has been for the Chiefs in his young career. The wideout has the most receptions (103) in the first 20 games of his career in franchise history. While it was a small sample size (three full games), Rice's 2024 campaign looked like it was going to result in a Year 2 breakout as one of the more prolific receivers in the NFL . Week 1 vs. Baltimore: 7 receptions (9 targets), 103 yards Week 2 vs. Cincinnati: 5 receptions (6 targets), 75 yards, 1 touchdown Week 3 at Atlanta : 12 receptions (12 targets), 110 yards, 1 touchdown Rice went down with his knee injury just four snaps into Kansas City's Week 4 matchup against the Chargers and wasn't targeted. Still, that three-game pace from last year would result in an eye-popping 136 catches, 1,632 yards receiving and roughly 11 receiving touchdowns over a full 17-game schedule. If you want a bigger sample size, here's Rice's 17-game pace based on his past nine healthy games: 126 catches for 1,522 yards and nine touchdowns. No matter how you slice it, you're looking at one of the busiest receivers in the NFL. Rice's role will largely be as a possession receiver with most of his targets coming inside of 10 yards and even behind the line of scrimmage. Here's a look at Rice's career passing bins (via TruMedia), which shows exactly that. TruMedia Rice's presence will likely make star tight end Travis Kelce more of a situational, red zone player in the passing attack, as Rice will likely work in similar windows and eat at his production. His return will also send JuJu Smith-Schuster back to being a depth piece. Rice working over the middle could open up deep-shot opportunities for Patrick Mahomes with downfield threats like Xavier Worthy and Hollywood Brown. Sunday's game against the Raiders will mark the first time the trio of Rice, Worthy and Brown will play together since Worthy was drafted in 2024. Betting impact of Rashee Rice's return Rashee Rice to record 750+ receiving yards (+185) Rashee Rice to record 1,000+ receiving yards (+800) The Chiefs' recent surge has brought them back as the betting favorites to win the AFC West at +125 on FanDuel Sportsbook . They also possess the second-best odds to win the AFC at +320, only behind the Buffalo Bills . If Rice can return to form relatively quickly and keep the Chiefs offense on the ascent, those odds will only get shorter. Meanwhile, Rice is currently +185 to record at least 750 yards receiving on the season and +800 to record at least 1,000 yards receiving, per FanDuel . With 11 games left on Kansas City's schedule, Rice would need to average roughly 68 yards per game to get to 750 and about 91 to get to 1,000 yards. During that small three-game sample size last year, Rice averaged 96 yards per game. Rice will not be eased back into action; the Chiefs are set to allocate a heavy workload for him as soon as possible, per ESPN . If that's to be believed and he remains healthy for the final 11 games, both the 750- and 1,000-yard marks are worth a sprinkle. Bet Rashee Rice props at FanDuel Sportsbook , where new users get $300 in bonus bets with a winning $5 wager. Fantasy impact of Rashee Rice's return From a fantasy perspective, Rice was in all likelihood drafted in most leagues, and managers will be hard-pressed to trade him now after enduring six weeks of him on their bench. Rice is rostered in 97% of CBS Sports Fantasy Football leagues, and that number should be a clean 100%. He's being started in 62% of leagues, which is another figure that should be much higher. That's particularly true in PPR leagues if he is expected to get the lion's share of targets in a Mahomes-led offense. Rice's return could slow down Kelce's target volume, but the tight end is still worth starting given the scarcity at his position. Bye week-fillers like Smith-Schuster and Tyquan Thornton are droppable in my eyes, while Worthy and Brown become even more boom-or-bust plays each week.",https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/rashee-rice-return-impact-chiefs-fantasy-betting,Sport,cbssports.com,,https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2023/12/13/30baac15-9e3f-4bd5-8f78-2f669dadb67d/thumbnail/1200x675/659e7f745209294fdd9aeca519c15e12/rashee-rice-kansas-city-chiefs-usatsi-21980782.jpg,2025-10-15T18:42:00+00:00,890d12c8f8b06acb210637d041739e0eefa69c05

Bet it at bet365 here : Mariners (-130) vs. Blue Jays The Mariners were able to overcome their short rest in the first two games of the ALCS after needing 15 innings to get past Detroit in Game 5 of the ALDS, as their best players stepped up with clutch hits in both games. They also benefited from outstanding pitching, silencing Toronto's offense on their home field. Starting pitcher George Kirby allowed just three runs on nine hits across 10 innings in Games 1 and 5 of the ALDS.

However, favorites were generally successful on Sunday with the Packers and Steelers both winning off the bye week. Will favorites continue to roll in Week 7 or can more underdogs get wins? If you're looking to get into parlay betting and NFL betting for Week 7 NFL games , be sure to see what SportsLine expert Jeff Hochman has put together. He's going with two parlays for Week 7, with one featuring only favorites on the money line and the other featuring only underdogs. Week 7 NFL money line favorites parlay Betting heavy favorites can be a solid strategy if you want to bet on a 3-team NFL money line parlay. This approach focuses on teams with odds of -150 or better, which means you lean towards high-probability outcomes. By pairing three teams that usually have odds between -150 and -350 or even higher, you're not only aiming for consistent, modest returns, but you're also stacking the deck in your favor for a higher chance of winning. Remember that you can still parlay a favorite with odds of -140 or less to avoid laying 2.5 points, which can significantly impact your chances of winning. Remember, you have to win all three legs for a successful wager. According to BetMGM data, NFL moneyline favorites at -115 or shorter posted a 68% win percentage in 2023, with a 66.5% rate in 2022. Over the six-season period from 2018-2024, NFL moneyline favorites maintained a 66.6% win rate (1,013-508-7). The strength of favorites correlates directly with their odds. In sports betting, if you see teams with odds between -150 and -200, they generally have a solid chance of winning, with around a 60-65% success rate. Teams that are even bigger favorites, with odds from -250 to -400, tend to be more reliable, showing win rates of about 70% to 80%. The 2024 NFL season stood out for favorites, with an overall win rate hitting 71.8%. NFL favorites dominated the opening week, winning 13 of 16 games for an 81.2% success rate. The second week saw more competitive results, with favorites winning 9 of 16 games for a 56.2% success rate. In Week 3 of the 2025 NFL season, 12 out of 16 favorites won outright, giving betting favorites a 75.0% success rate. In Week 4, favorites struggled on a relative basis, going 10-5-1. Two weeks ago, NFL betting favorites had its worst week this season going 8-5. In Week 6, NFL betting chalk bounced back by winning 11 of 15 games. NFL betting favorites have won 63 out of 92 games through the first six weeks of the 2025 season, resulting in an overall success rate of 68.4%. That number is currently below the 71.8% mark from last year. What does it mean for Week 7? Will underdogs bounce back? Cleveland Browns over Miami Dolphins Let's not overthink this matchup. I was skeptical about the Dolphins heading into this season, and nothing I've seen so far indicates they are prepared to succeed against the Browns' defense in the Dawg Pound. Cleveland's defense ranks third in the NFL, allowing just 262.3 yards per game, while Miami's stop unit ranks 30th, averaging 389.3 yards allowed per game. Myles Garrett recorded two sacks when these teams faced off in Florida last year. However, both starting quarterbacks were different, making that game irrelevant to the current matchup. Garrett has not recorded a sack in his last three games and will be looking to capitalize against a subpar offensive line. Watch for his anytime sack line if it's available at a reasonable price (+140 or higher). Cleveland's rushing defense is ranked third, conceding only 79.7 yards per game, while Miami yields 168.5 yards on the ground (32nd). At home, the Browns will lean further into early-down runs to wear down Miami's front and control the clock. I don't care whether it's Dillon Gabriel or Shedeur Sanders ; whichever quarterback finishes this game should find success in this spot. Los Angeles Chargers over Indianapolis Colts The Chargers host the Colts at SoFi Stadium in what could be a critical AFC clash between two division leaders. The Colts will be playing their second consecutive road game in Los Angeles after two straight home tilts. They are currently ranked fourth in net yards per play, while facing the 29th hardest schedule. In contrast, the Chargers are ranked 10th in NYPP while playing against the 17th hardest slate. Jonathan Taylor is the Colts' most dangerous offensive weapon. He leads the NFL with 603 rushing yards through six games, averaging 5.3 yards per carry and scoring seven rushing touchdowns. However, the Chargers' rushing defense—while struggling recently—has shown it can rise to the occasion. The key to stopping the Colts is to contain Taylor and the running game. The Chargers' brilliant coaching staff knows Indianapolis cannot run wild if they want to win this game. Daniel Jones will have difficulty throwing against the Chargers, who rank second in opponent passer rating (73.7). It should be an entertaining matchup to watch. Although Los Angeles has struggled without Khalil Mack (elbow injury since Week 2), the unit ranks ninth in overall defensive rankings. With Mack potentially eligible to return after opening his 21-day practice window, the Chargers could see a significant boost to their pass rush at the perfect time. The Colts have scored 71 points in their last two games and now hit the road. This is a strong system play that supports the home team. Justin Herbert should have a lot of success passing and running the ball. Play the hosts. Denver Broncos over New York Giants This will be a significant test for Jaxson Dart and the Giants, who will face an elite defense at a high altitude following a big win against the defending Super Bowl champions. The Giants will have a quick rematch against Philadelphia next week. Denver's defense has been historic through Week 6. It leads the NFL with 30 sacks—ten more than any other team—and ranks second in both total defense (4.3 yards allowed per play) and scoring defense (15.8 points allowed per game). New York's offense has significantly improved, and its season-long statistics are somewhat skewed due to Russell Wilson 's play early in the season and the absence of Andrew Thomas at tackle. During their current six-game home winning streak, the Broncos have allowed just 12.8 points per game and outscored opponents by nearly 20 points each contest. Based on simulations, I believe the home team will win, with a probability of over 85%. However, I would not be surprised if the Giants remain within one possession due to a backdoor cover. Week 7 NFL money line underdogs parlay A very popular option is available if you're willing to take on a bit more risk for a potentially higher reward. Underdog money line parlays offer the largest possible payouts in the NFL betting landscape. Combining three underdogs with odds like +200, +150, and +300 could result in payouts exceeding 20-to-1 or higher. The best part is that, due to the high payouts, underdog parlays can still be profitable even when winning only a small percentage of bets. For example, hitting just one of several large underdog parlays could offset multiple losses and generate overall profit. NFL underdogs have historically outperformed expectations in specific situations, with home underdogs of +2 to +3 winning outright 46-48% of the time. Tennessee Titans over New England Patriots I know we are on the Titans again. Don't turn away. Please hear me out. Following Brian Callahan's termination last week, Mike McCoy has been appointed as the interim head coach for Tennessee. McCoy's first challenge is competing against Patriots head coach Mike Vrabel, who led Tennessee from 2018-23 before moving to the Northeast. This emotional subplot should fire up a buy-in from players and fanbase alike, turning Nissan Stadium into a potential hostile environment for Vrabel's new squad. In terms of matchups, there is an excellent opportunity for an upset. New England's pass defense has yielded 239.0 yards per game (25th-ranked), allowing a 69.4% completion rate. Tennessee counters with rookie QB Cam Ward 's play-action mastery and WR Calvin Ridley , who leads the team with 290 receiving yards. On the flip side, the Titans' pass defense is ranked 13th, allowing only 209.7 yards per game. Tennessee has played the eight-hardest schedule, while New England has played the second easiest through six weeks. The Titans have a massive special teams edge. Tennessee ranks first in net punting (45.3 yards) this season. New England's coverage unit surrenders a 24.1-yard kick-return average (29th) and has given up multiple return TDs this season. Consistently flipping field position enables the Titans to start their drives from beyond the 35-yard line. New England sits dead last (32nd) in EPA per rush and 29th in yards per carry, with both running backs grading among Pro Football Focus's bottom five this season. The Patriots are uncertain about how the new head coach plans to attack them offensively and what adjustments the Titans might make defensively. It's a guessing game for the road team as big chalk. Throw in a 50% chance of light rain, and we have all the ingredients for an upset that nobody saw coming except for yours truly. Minnesota Vikings over Philadelphia Eagles Minnesota's defense leads the NFL in expected points added (EPA) per play allowed at –0.20, anchored by the league's top pass defense at –0.42 EPA per pass play. Its front seven generates pressure on 36.6% of dropbacks, ranking 11th, and allows fewer than 160 passing yards per game. This seems like a terrific matchup for the Vikings. The Eagles' offense has struggled significantly because opposing teams have figured out their play strategy. Philadelphia ranks 22nd in EPA per pass play, and Jalen Hurts ' unit has been held to 17 points in each of its last two losses. The Super Bowl hangover has been in full effect. The betting market is giving too much respect to Philadelphia's Super Bowl pedigree and 4-2 record while undervaluing Minnesota's defensive improvements and home-field advantages. With the Vikings getting 2.5 points at home and +125 to win straight up against a struggling Eagles offense, this line presents clear value. The Eagles are in the middle of a division sandwich, having played the Giants last Thursday and playing them again in Week 8. Every team will be fired up to play the defending Super Bowl champions. Minnesota has a strong home-field advantage, ranking in the top five. Kevin O'Connell has won two of three after a bye week, with the only loss by two points against Detroit last year in Minnesota. Giving offensive-minded head coaches two weeks to prepare is typically an advantage not accounted for in the line. I made this line Philadelphia -1 with a healthy J.J. McCarthy under center. Love the home team at plus money. Houston Texans over Seattle Seahawks Despite entering as +155 underdogs, the Texans' elite pass rush and top-five defense, combined with Seattle's offensive line vulnerabilities and key injuries, create the perfect recipe for an upset on Monday Night Football. Also, the schedule makers did the Seahawks no favors through Week 6 by alternating home and away games from the beginning of the season. The Seahawks are favored for a reason. Seattle owns a clear advantage in offensive efficiency, generating more yards per play and converting third downs and red-zone trips at a higher rate. Its special teams and run defense are both top-five units. The Texans' strong pass defense and proficient third-down stops keep them competitive, and they have two weeks to prepare against a fatigued team playing in its seventh consecutive week. Houston's defense currently ranks fourth in defensive DVOA, allowing only 12.2 points per game, the lowest in the league, over the first six weeks. The Texans have a strong pass rush, ranking third in pass-rush win rate by generating pressure on 29% of dropbacks. Meanwhile, Seattle's offensive line is struggling, sitting at the bottom with a pass-block win rate of just 51%, which leaves them vulnerable to stunts and blitzes. Seattle is just 1–2 this season at Lumen Field with a blowout win over New Orleans. Seattle's injury report lists multiple defensive linemen as out or questionable, including a starting end and both starting tackles. While these absences weaken Seattle's pass rush, they also limit rotation against Houston's rushing attack, creating fewer favorable matchups to slow down C.J. Stroud and company. The Texans are currently at league average in rushing yards, but show increased production following a bye week. This is an excellent price for the underdog in this spot.",https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/nfl-week-7-betting-chargers-texans-in-experts-best-money-line-parlays-for-favorites-and-underdogs,Sport,cbssports.com,,https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2025/09/30/e88f44d0-d35f-4a64-9520-0aed696b28a6/thumbnail/1200x675/d19688beccc2e2f7962ffac27a43e66e/texans.png,2025-10-15T18:35:26+00:00,fc46260adf21e64cbbd1b4364adec82ec88dea99
8832501bae48,"Fantasy Football Dynasty Rankings Update for Week 7: Expectations for CeeDee Lamb, Rashee Rice, and Mike Evans",,"It has been a difficult year at wide receiver in Fantasy Football . We are hoping it is about to get easier with CeeDee Lamb , Rashee Rice , and Mike Evans expected to make their returns in Week 7. This could shift the landscape in many leagues, and for at least two of these players, there may be an opportunity to make a deal as they make their return. Here is my Dynasty outlook for each before we get to the weekly rankings update. Lamb is the most valuable of the trio, clocking in at WR6 in the rankings below. He had been a top-three Dynasty wide receiver for most of the last three years, and I wouldn't really fault anyone for putting him there right now. Truth be told, Lamb is about as close in value to WR2 as he is to WR8 in my trade chart. His age isn't a concern yet; he doesn't turn 27 until next April, but he is older than any other receiver in my top seven. Expect a top-five wide receiver rest of the season, with multiple top-five seasons on the horizon. Rice comes in next, at WR20 in my rankings. I want to acknowledge from the start that I am lower than the consensus at that ranking. Many people will point to the 12-game sample from the end of Rice's rookie year through the start of last year as proof of what he will be, a Fantasy WR1. I am slightly more skeptical, particularly this year. The Chiefs receiver room is as deep as it's ever been, and Patrick Mahomes doesn't need to hyper-focus on Rice like he did before. That being said, if he does, I will be quick to move Rice up closer to where everyone else has him. But if you agree with me, this is an excellent chance to sell high, before he disappoints anyone in his first game back. This week on Fantasy Football Today Dynasty , I answered your questions about Marvin Harrison Jr. , Jaxon Dart, and more. Check it out: Evans is perhaps the easiest to diagnose. If you have Evans on your roster and your team is no longer contending like you expected, he is one of the most important sells in Dynasty. The difficult part is knowing whether to deal him on excitement that he's back or wait for one big game and try to get a higher return. If I could get two second-round picks, I would make the move now. He's 32 years old, coming off a hamstring injury, and Emeka Egubka and Chris Godwin are both likely coming back this year. If he struggles in his first game back, you may struggle to get even one second-round pick. As always, you can get my weekly updated Dynasty Trade Charts over on SportsLine .

e96a212f040e,Agent's Take: These big NFL acquisitions have made little impact on their new team this season,,"New veteran acquisitions, either by trade or signed as free agents, paying dividends were highlighted last week . The opposite end of the spectrum gets the focus this time around. Several veteran newcomers who haven't lived up to expectations so far have been identified. Contribution, availability, salary and draft capital to acquire were taken into account when making the selections. Joe Flacco and Russell Wilson aren't included because each was expected to be replaced by a rookie quarterback at some point this season. It happened sooner than anticipated. Wilson was benched for New York Giants first-round pick Jaxson Dart , who was taken 25th overall, after three games. Flacco lasted four games before Cleveland Browns third-round pick Dillon Gabriel took over. Obviously, neither was playing well. Both ranked near the bottom in completion percentage and passer rating. Flacco's six interceptions when he was benched were the NFL's second most through four games. Fields' preseason struggles were dismissed instead of being seen as a warning sign after he played well against the Pittsburgh Steelers in the regular-season opener. It's been downhill for Fields ever since the Steelers game. Fields had a dubious distinction in Week 6's loss to the Denver Broncos , which dropped the NFL's only winless team to 0-6. Fields was sacked nine times in producing a franchise-worst minus-10 net passing yards. The 2021 first-round pick has a tendency to hold the ball too long and doesn't see the field as well as he should in his fifth NFL season. Coach Aaron Glenn was taken aback at questions about whether Fields should be benched in favor of Tyrod Taylor . Fields may have a fairly long leash because of economics. The Jets signed him to a two-year, $40 million deal with $30 million fully guaranteed as an unrestricted free agent in March. The Raiders dealt a 2025 third-round pick to the Seattle Seahawks for Smith in March to provide quarterback stability after having six players start at quarterback since releasing Derek Carr , following the 2022 season. Shortly after the trade, Smith was given a two-year, $75 million contract extension, averaging $37.5 million per year with $50.5 million in guarantees where $42.5 million was fully guaranteed at signing. Incentives and salary escalators make the deal worth as much as $84 million. The trade reunited Smith with Pete Carroll, who was hired as Raiders coach in January. Carroll was Smith's coach during the first five years of his six years in Seattle. Smith hasn't resembled the player who was named 2022's NFL Comeback Player of the Year. He leads the NFL with 10 interceptions while the Raiders are off to a 2-4 start. Smith is the first to throw 10 interceptions in the first six games since Kirk Cousins in 2020. His 77.6 passer rating is 31st in the NFL. Smith could have a short stint in Las Vegas if he can't get the interceptions under control like Cousins did. Cousins only had three more passes picked off for the rest of the 2020 season. Out of Smith's $26.5 million base salary in 2026, $18.5 million was fully guaranteed at signing. The Raiders would pick up $8 million of 2026 salary cap space by releasing Smith before the remainder of his base salary becomes fully guaranteed next March 13 on the third day of the 2026 league year. Moore received a four-year, $82 million contract with $50 million in guarantees, of which $42.51 million was fully guaranteed at signing to be a key upgrade for the Titans on the offensive line. The signing allowed JC Latham , 2024's seventh overall pick, to move to right tackle, his position in college at Alabama. Things haven't gone as planned. The four sacks Moore has surrendered are tied for the NFL's fourth most among left tackles, according to Pro Football Focus. The 18 quarterback pressures (combined sacks, quarterback hurries and quarterback hits) Moore has allowed are also the sixth most for a left tackle as tracked by PFF. Engram quickly found a home in Denver after being a salary cap casualty of the Jacksonville Jaguars in early March. He signed a two-year, $23 million contract worth up to $26 million through incentives with $16.5 million fully guaranteed. Coach Sean Payton envisioned Engram operating in the ""Joker"" role as an offensive weapon who moves around to create mismatches like he utilized to great success with his offenses during his 15 years coaching the New Orleans Saints . Engram, who has been slowed with calf and back issues, has 17 receptions for 137 yards and one touchdown in five games this season. The Broncos will need to get Engram more involved in the offense to reach his potential. The Giants signed Adebo to a three-year, $54 million deal (worth up to $57 million through incentives) with $38.5 million in guarantees where $34.75 million was fully guaranteed at signing to be their No. 1 cornerback. Adebo has allowed the second most receptions (29) and the fifth most receiving yards (308) among cornerbacks this season, according to PFF. Adebo struggled in coverage against both CeeDee Lamb and George Pickens in Week 2's game with the Dallas Cowboys . A.J. Brown got the better of Adebo in Week 6's contest against the Philadelphia Eagles . Under PFF's lockdown percentage metric, which measures how well a defender prevents a receiver from getting open, Adebo is at 31.07%. By contrast, Charvarius Ward , who signed a similar $18 million per year deal with the Indianapolis Colts , has a 55.56 lockdown percentage this season. Reddick was one of the NFL's most effective pass rushers before an ill-convinced 90-day holdout that ended during the latter part of October last season. He had one sack in the 10 games he played with the Jets after ending his holdout. NFL teams didn't give Reddick the benefit of the doubt for his 2024 performance as a big payday in free agency eluded him. Reddick signed a one-year, $14 million contract where $12 million was fully guaranteed with the Buccaneers. Reddick has yet to resemble the two-time Pro Bowler who was coming off four straight seasons with double-digit sacks prior to his holdout. The 31-year-old has 1.5 sacks in six games this year, which puts him on pace for four sacks. The Broncos ignored durability concerns about Greenlaw when signing him to a three-year, $31.5 million contract, averaging $10.5 million per year worth up to $34.5 million. Greenlaw looked great when making his short-lived 2024 season debut in Week 15 after recovering from a torn Achilles suffered in Super Bowl LVIII. Left knee soreness sidelined Greenlaw during the third quarter of his return game. A calf injury the following week landed Greenlaw on injured reserve. Greenlaw was on the field for just 34 defensive snaps last season. He was also limited to three games in 2021 because of a groin injury. Greenlaw is on IR with a quad injury. He initially hurt his quad while training and couldn't participate in the offseason workout program because of the injury. A setback during training camp kept Greenlaw out of action in preseason games and the first two regular-season games before landing him IR. Greenlaw is now eligible to be activated from IR after missing the requisite four games after going on the list. He is expected to give an already stingy Broncos defense a boost once he returns. Robinson was signed to a one-year, $12 million contract worth a maximum of $14.5 million through incentives as a part of wholesale changes the Texans made in revamping the offensive line. The assumption was Robinson would replace Laremy Tunsil , who was traded to the Washington Commanders in March, at left tackle. Robinson's minor left knee injury during training camp opened the door for 2025 second-round pick Aireontae Ersery to take the starting role. Robinson had started all of the 101 games he had played in his eight NFL seasons prior to this year. The Cleveland Browns losing starting left tackle Dawand Jones to a season-ending knee injury in Week 3 led to a trade for Robinson. The Texans acquired a 2027 sixth-round pick in exchange for Robinson and a 2027 seventh-round pick. Robinson was a healthy scratch in his final game with the Texans against the Titans in Week 4 before the trade. The Texans paid $9,415,032 for his four-game stint, which mostly consisted of an $8.75 million signing bonus. Harris signed a one-year prove-it deal for a fully guaranteed $5.25 million, with an additional $4 million in incentives, despite rushing for over 1,000 yards in each of his four NFL seasons. An eye injury sustained in a Fourth of July fireworks mishap cost Harris practically all of the preseason. He wasn't cleared for full contact until a couple of days before the Chargers' regular-season opener. The Chargers were starting to gradually increase Harris' workload when he tore his left Achilles in Week 3 against the Broncos. Harris, who was expected to split time in the backfield with 2025 first-round pick Omarion Hampton , had 61 yards on 15 carries in the three games he played prior to his injury. The Super Bowl champion Eagles sent Gardner-Johnson and a 2026 sixth-round pick to the Texans for offensive guard Kenyon Green and a 2025 fifth-round pick in March. Only $2 million of Gardner-Johnson's $7.75 million base salary was fully guaranteed until $6.58 million of this $7.75 million was converted to signing bonus a few days before Houston's regular-season opener. The remaining $1.17 million left as base salary was fully guaranteed. Gardner-Johnson, who tied for the NFL's third most interceptions with six in 2024, started Houston's first three games, before he was released. Key missed assignments in those games, all one-score losses, and reported locker room friction led to Gardner-Johnson's departure. Gardner-Johnson joined the Baltimore Ravens ' practice squad ahead of Week 6's games. He was granted his release after the Ravens subsequently acquired safety Alohi Gilman from the Chargers in a trade.",https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/agents-take-these-big-nfl-acquisitions-have-made-little-impact-on-their-new-team-this-season,Sport,cbssports.com,,https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2025/09/16/d8ca3b9d-6c10-4ffa-843d-c7d4fa64f0d2/thumbnail/1200x675/5b7fec94ac2bee55c1c217d43882e748/geno-smith-hype-getty.jpg,2025-10-15T18:20:33+00:00,10236eef372ea7edd4f20e30e3509275676d5fa6

Creel also helped get the best rushing performance of the season from Cam Cook, a junior transfer from TCU who now leads the nation at 832 rushing yards. Cook ran for 218 yards and two touchdowns on 7.0 yards per rush last week. Jacksonville State is third in the nation on rush attempts per game (49.6), and despite teams thinking they know what type of play is coming, the Gamecocks are 14th in the nation in yards per rush (5.4). The model projects this rushing attack to be too much for Delaware, which is allowing 4.4 yards per rush (74th in the nation), and the Gamecocks cover the spread in 70% of simulations.

Hunter Watson completed 12 of 19 passes for 136 yards and three touchdowns while rushing for 52 yards. Alton McCaskill added 87 yards on 14 carries (6.2 yards per rush) and Chris Reed had two touchdown receptions.

Several NFL prop picks will center on Rodgers, Jaylen Warren , DK Metcalf and other Steelers considering Cincy's poor defense, but Pittsburgh hasn't been a Steel Curtain on that side of the ball either. It ranks 27th in passing defense, so Joe Flacco , Ja'Marr Chase and Tee Higgins will also be popular with NFL player props and Thursday Night Football betting. Rodgers has an NFL prop bar of 216.5 passing yards, after he threw for 235 yards in Week 6 and hit the Over. However, he went under this NFL prop total in three straight games prior to Sunday, and with Cincy possessing the No. 28 run defense, Pittsburgh may lean more on the ground game. With the same prop odds of -114 for the Over and Under, this may be one TNF prop to simply avoid altogether.

Top NFL player prop bets for Bengals vs. Steelers After analyzing the Steelers vs. Bengals props and examining the dozens of NFL player prop markets, the SportsLine's Machine Learning Model  says Bengals WR Chase goes Over 69.5 receiving yards (-114 at FanDuel ). The Steelers have always struggled to contain Chase, who has at least 81 receiving yards in four straight versus Pittsburgh. He's averaged 98 receiving yards over this stretch, and many of those defenses were much better than this year's unit in Pittsburgh. The Steelers are giving up 178.8 receiving yards to opposing wideouts, which is the third-most in the NFL. Chase is also coming off 94-plus receiving yards in each of the last two weeks, and he showed great rapport with Flacco on Sunday, posting a stat line of 10-94-1. It's also important to note that Thursday's game will take place in Cincinnati, where Chase has gone over his receiving yardage prop in each of his last five home games, which includes a Week 13 contest versus the Steelers last season.

bb5de3348195,Russell Wilson landing spots: Where the benched Giants QB could end up before the trade deadline,"russell wilson trade, russell wilson landing spots, russell wilson trade rumors, russell wilson trade destinations, nfl trade deadline 2025, jaxson dart giants, nfl trade rumors","Russell Wilson 's future with the New York Giants is firmly in question, particularly after the veteran quarterback was benched earlier this season in favor of rookie standout Jaxson Dart . With the NFL trade deadline looming on Nov. 4, Wilson is a potential name to monitor for a quarterback-needy team . Wilson signed a one-year, $10.5 million deal this offseason and was supposed to hold down the fort as Dart, the 25th pick in the 2025 NFL Draft , developed in the shadows. Even amid Dart's tremendous preseason, head coach Brian Daboll held firm with Wilson as the team's starter. That faith deteriorated quickly with Wilson, who completed 59.1% of his passes and registered a 78.5 passer rating through three weeks (both on pace to be career lows). That was all Daboll needed to see to push the eject button on Wilson. So what's next? Let's explore that possibility, shall we? Below, we'll identify a couple of landing spots if he were to be dealt and ponder what's next for the former Super Bowl champion. At least he'd save on moving fees, right? The New York Jets are in a bad way at the moment, currently 0-6 on the young season. They are coming off a Week 6 matchup against the Denver Broncos in London where Justin Fields was non-existent as a passer. In all, New York had a -10 net passing yard total, which has brought Fields' job security into question. If the coaching staff/front office feel as if they've gotten all they get out of Fields and do not want to turn things over to Tyrod Taylor , Wilson could be an option in an attempt to bring the passing attack to a somewhat respectable level. New Orleans went through the least-exciting quarterback battle this summer, and it felt like Spencer Rattler bested rookie Tyler Shough by default. Fast forward to Week 7, and the Saints are 1-5 on the year. Rattler has been efficient (at least a 66.7% completion rate in five straight games), but the wins have been few and far between. They've also registered the ninth-fewest yards per game (306.7) in the league and are averaging just 18.5 points per game (fourth lowest). That lackluster production could open the door for a pursuit of Wilson to make sense if they want to be a more competitive outfit. Retirement Cards on the table, I tried getting to three possible trade destinations for Wilson and was struggling to find the third. And that brought me to this avenue: Retirement. Maybe there isn't a next stop for Wilson. After all, his play is deteriorating, he is set to turn 37 years old in November and is already on his third team in as many seasons and possibly onto his fourth. If no team comes calling at the deadline, that could be a sign that things are just about wrapped up. Oftentimes, the game tells you when the time has come rather than the other way around, and, after 14 seasons in the league, a Super Bowl title and 10 Pro Bowls to show for it, the clock may be striking midnight on Wilson.",https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/russell-wilson-trade-deadline-landing-spots-giants-qb-rumors,Sport,cbssports.com,,https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2025/09/14/98a5f527-464c-4d02-aad1-b8471232cc28/thumbnail/1200x675/918ef390ec02778753c1ce0d7addde7c/usatsi-27082202-russell-wilson-nyg-qb-1q-2025-1400.jpg,2025-10-15T18:06:18+00:00,97110b9ecc36eda221c3dfeeb2b63b3b604112e5

93ac8197020b,"Big 12 fines Texas Tech for repeated tortilla throwing, Kansas for disparaging comments about conference",,"Getty Images The Big 12 announced Wednesday it has fined both Texas Tech and Kansas following the Red Raiders' 42-17 win against the Jayhawks in Week 7. Texas Tech was tagged for ""repeated instances of objects being thrown onto the playing surface,"" while Kansas incurred a penalty after coach Lance Leipold publicly critiqued both Texas Tech and the Big 12 for their handling of Tech's tortilla-tossing tradition. ""After a formal review, Texas Tech did not take sufficient steps to prevent and deter the repeated throwing of objects onto the field and team bench areas,"" Big 12 commissioner Brett Yormark said in a statement. ""Coach Leipold's comments questioned the integrity and professionalism of both the Conference and a member institution. Both actions warranted a financial penalty. ""The Big 12 Conference prioritizes integrity and will have no further comment on the matter."" Texas Tech was assessed two separate 15-yard personal foul penalties when fans threw tortillas onto the field following kickoffs while the game was being played. Fans have tossed tortillas onto the field inside Jones AT&T Stadium for decades. But the issue reached a head in the offseason when Big 12 athletic directors voted 15-to-1 to crack down on the league's enforcement policy against foreign objects being thrown onto the field. Texas Tech coach Joey McGuire and Leipold got into a heated exchange on the field following Saturday's game. Against the wall: Texas, Michigan, LSU among college football teams with most to prove in season's second half Will Backus Leipold stated after the game he thought the tortilla-related incidents were handled ""very poorly"" by the Big 12's officials. ""One of the officials almost got hit and he tried to throw a flag and it got picked up so that was disappointing,"" Leipold said. ""We have a policy put in that wasn't followed through, so that was very disappointing on how that was... I know the officials were just as frustrated after the one penalty was picked up."" Leipold also claimed that a pocketknife hit one of his staff members when it was thrown from the crowd. The Big 12 called that an ""inaccurate statement.""",https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/news/big-12-fines-texas-tech-for-repeated-tortilla-throwing-kansas-for-disparaging-comments-about-conference,Sport,cbssports.com,,https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2025/10/15/652a09cc-0bd5-4c70-8ce2-fcbdc2106b32/thumbnail/1200x675/36828ac30b45ced87bb315ff34cfed1e/adobe-express-file-42.jpg,2025-10-15T17:42:55+00:00,ec58267914dd16b260f5fe71589b7aa281143e9a

Patriots vs. Titans sees New England on the road for the third straight week, and the Pats, led by former Tennessee coach Mike Vrabel, are 7-point favorites as they look to complete this road trip 3-0. Additionally, the Chiefs fans will get to see their team take part in a 1 p.m. ET kickoff for the only time in the first 11 weeks of the 2025 NFL season. Kansas City is an 11.5-point home favorite, the largest on the board, per the latest Week  NFL odds, as they host the Raiders. Then, a Monday night doubleheader sees the Texans visiting the Seahawks in the nightcap at 10 p.m. ET. This is just the second time in the last 20 years that the Texans will play at Seattle, with the home team favored by 3.5 points. Detroit is -5.5 against the Bucs in the first Monday game.

Philly is coming off a mini-bye after playing last Thursday, but Minnesota is coming off a full bye after covering versus Cleveland in Week 5. Covering, or winning, isn't something that the Eagles have done recently as they're 0-2 both against the spread and straight up over their last two games. The Philly offense is in shambles as its two lowest point totals over the last calendar year have come in its two most recent contests. Since the start of last year, Minnesota has the second-best spread record overall (14-8-1), as well as the second-best spread record at home (7-3). As for the Eagles, they haven't shown a tendency to bounce back versus the line after outright defeats, which is what they're coming off with a Thursday loss to the Giants. Philadelphia is only 3-7 against the spread after a straight-up loss since the start of the 2023 season. The model has Minnesota prevailing versus the spread well over 50% of the time. See which other teams to pick here . Another one of its Week 7 NFL predictions: the Broncos (-7, 40.5) cover versus the Giants in well over 50% of simulations. Bo Nix is a perfect 6-0 against the spread versus NFC opponents in his career and is also 7-1 versus the line as a home favorite. A big part of that is Denver having the most ferocious pass rush the NFL has possibly ever seen. Last year, Denver's 63 sacks were the most in the league and the second-most by any team over the last two decades. This year, Denver is on pace for an NFL record of 85 sacks which would shatter the record of 72 set by the 1984 Chicago Bears. Now, the Broncos get to face a rookie quarterback in Jaxson Dart who gets sacked at the ninth-highest rate in the league. Dart has looked impressive at home but had three turnovers in his lone road start at New Orleans, which was both a defeat and a spread loss for New York. After taking down one New York quarterback in Justin Fields nine times in Week 6, Denver is projected to take down another, in Dart, at least five times on Sunday, as the Broncos are forecasted to win by double-digits. The model also says the Over hits well over 50% of the time. See which other teams to pick here . How to make Week 7 NFL picks The model has also made the call on who wins and covers in every other game on the Week 7 NFL schedule and just revealed four teams that win by nearly 70% of simulations, or more, potentially giving you a huge payday.

The Volunteers have been without their two top corners all season and it shows. Tennessee ranks 119th in pass defense, allowing 277 yards per game. Alabama quarterback Ty Simpson should feast on the Volunteers and strengthen his Heisman Trophy candidacy Saturday after facing tough defenses in Georgia, Vanderbilt and Missouri the last three weeks. ""Tennessee has allowed 30+ points in its three SEC games against Arkansas, Mississippi State and Georgia. They also gave up 24 points to lowly UAB.

a13272edf6bf,"Against the wall: Texas, Michigan, LSU among college football teams with most to prove in season's second half","college football teams to watch, college football midseason, college football second half, texas football, michigan football, lsu football, oregon football","We've reached the midway point of the 2025 college football season, which means it's an appropriate time to re-evaluate where teams stand and adjust their expectations for their last six games. Most programs have already gone through their nonconference slates and are already in the thick of league play. There's plenty of data to parse through. While there have been a lot of positive surprises thus far -- such as No. 3 Indiana reaching its highest AP Top 25 ranking in program history -- there are a fair share of teams that have failed to meet preseason expectations. The year is far from over. The 12-team College Football Playoff format means that a larger field of schools is involved in the race, even if they've already faced some early season slip-ups. It's still hard to climb to the top. Here's a look at a few teams that still have plenty to prove in the second half of the 2025 college football season. The Buyout Bubble: Why college football keeps paying millions to make coaches disappear Brandon Marcello 247Sports' Big 12 team site staffers picked Arizona State to repeat as conference champions before the season began. The Sun Devils did lose do-it-all weapon Cam Skattebo to the NFL Draft , but they returned a wealth of experience on both sides of the ball, including a potential Heisman Trophy candidate at quarterback in Sam Leavitt . Halfway through the year and the Sun Devils are behind the likes of Texas Tech , BYU and Cincinnati . They are a respectable 4-2, with both of those losses coming on the road. Arizona State was also without Leavitt in its latest loss to Utah as he recovers from a lingering injury. Any loss can set you behind in the Big 12, though, and the Sun Devils have no margin for error if they want to make their way back to AT&T Stadium -- and perhaps beyond. Outlook the rest of the way: Arizona State is still in the thick of the Big 12 race. One loss sets it back a bit, but that pendulum swings the other way -- the Sun Devils can absolutely benefit from creating some chaos of their own. They'll get a chance to unseat No. 7 Texas Tech, the runaway league favorite thus far, this Saturday. No. 10 LSU If the College Football Playoff started today, LSU would be squarely in the field for the first time since 2019. But it doesn't start today and, in spite of the lofty ranking next to its name, LSU has not looked entirely convincing thus far. The Tigers' most notable win -- their season opener against Clemson -- looks worse with each passing week and they lost in their only game against a currently ranked opponent. The defense has taken significant strides. Surprisingly, it's the offense that has held LSU back this season. Quarterback Garrett Nussmeier is clearly battling through some injury issues, but he didn't look all that great before that. He's also not a very mobile quarterback playing behind a poor offensive line, which is a recipe for failure. The Tigers have not scored more than 20 points against a Power Four conference opponent. That's not going to cut it when they play the likes of No. 17 Vanderbilt , No. 6 Alabama and No. 4 Texas A&M . Outlook the rest of the way: The SEC is cannibalizing itself a bit this year, which keeps the door open for LSU in spite of its early season setback against Ole Miss . As outlined above, it's going to be an extremely tough road. The Tigers are an underdog against Vanderbilt for the first time since 1948 and they won't be favored against either Alabama or Texas A&M. They're going to have to go 2-1 in those games, at the very least, to maintain those playoff hopes. Michigan's got a steep hill to climb if it wants to be considered a serious contender for either the playoff or its own conference. The Wolverines' 31-13 loss to USC in Week 7 hammered home the fact that they're a long way from the top. So far, they're 1-2 against currently ranked opponents with an average scoring margin of 8.7 points in the opponent's favor. Michigan's win against Nebraska also came before the Huskers were ranked inside of the AP Top 25, while USC beat Michigan while it was ranked. Maybe it isn't a coincidence that Michigan's offense looked a lot better when coach Sherrone Moore was suspended. Freshman quarterback Bryce Underwood hasn't looked the same since the Nebraska win. Moore could benefit from unleashing him. Perhaps most surprising, though, is the defense's poor play. Michigan just allowed a walk-on running back to rush for 158 yards and one touchdown on just 18 carries in the USC loss. Outlook the rest of the way: All is not lost. Michigan has to win out, starting with a tough game against Washington on Saturday. No. 1 Ohio State also looms large at the end of the year. It's doable -- especially since the Wolverines have won four straight against the Buckeyes -- but this team put itself behind the 8-ball. It's fair to question Oregon's strength of record thus far, especially since Penn State plummeted off a cliff in the weeks after Oregon's overtime win against the Nittany Lions. The Ducks have won four games against FBS opponents. Those FBS opponents have a combined record of 8-17. Their highest-quality win thus far? Against a 4-2 Northwestern squad that lost 23-3 against Tulane in its season opener. Oregon lost by 10 points to No. 3 Indiana in its only showdown against a currently ranked opponent. That's not a good look for a team trying to build off of last season's Big Ten title and appearance as the College Football Playoff's top overall seed. The only reason Oregon's still ranked inside of the top 10 is because of poll momentum. Outlook the rest of the way: Oregon's toughest remaining opponent is No. 20, and the Ducks get that game at home. It's hard to see them being underdogs at any point in the latter half of the year. An 11-1 Oregon gets into the playoff without any sweat. That might also be good enough for a repeat appearance in the Big Ten Championship Game. Texas may actually be turning a corner entering the meat of its SEC schedule. Turning a corner midway through the year isn't exactly the standard that a preseason No. 1 team should be striving for, but that is reality for the Longhorns. They were quickly knocked down from that top spot in a season-opening loss to Ohio State and then eliminated from the top 25 entirely a few weeks later due to a stunning defeat against Florida . Texas did get back on track with its Week 7 triumph over Oklahoma , giving the Longhorns their third Red River victory of the past four years. Embattled quarterback Arch Manning didn't put up eye-popping numbers, but he did put up arguably his best performance of the season against a strong Sooners defense. Maybe that was what Texas needed to build some momentum for a latter half of the schedule that sees it play No. 17 Vanderbilt, No. 9 Georgia and No. 4 Texas A&M. Outlook the rest of the way: It's the SEC, so Texas still has plenty of time to stack some quality wins. As with other two-loss teams, though, the 'Horns are skating on thin ice. There will be a glut of 10-2 teams by season's end, so that means it will be virtually impossible for any programs beyond that bar to make the cut for a 12-team playoff.",https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/news/college-football-teams-most-to-prove-texas-michigan-lsu,Sport,cbssports.com,,https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2025/10/15/c1391b99-f718-4d52-85e6-d43fc93c9812/thumbnail/1200x675/dbd4612f61a5da6013808548f12dcf49/anthony-hill-texas-oklahoma.jpg,2025-10-15T17:32:26+00:00,960dce2eca85418ccefe568ad4e180016987b7a5
31e9c26e4f82,"‘Big Rock Burning’ Documentary, About Aftermath of Palisades Fire, Reveals Trailer and Streaming Date",,"A documentary about the aftermath of this year’s devastating L.A. wildfires — executive produced by Mark Hamill and Ricki Lake — has launched as the film hit Vimeo on Wednesday. Directed by David Goldblum, a local to Big Rock who lost his home in the fire, “Big Rock Burning” is a 30-minute film that tells the stories of residents impacted by the Pacific Palisades blazes and captures their process of rebuilding destroyed neighborhoods. Following the reported arrest of suspected arsonist Jonathan Rinderknecht, who authorities have accused of intentionally setting the spark, the filmmakers chose to bypass traditional distribution to release the film directly to audiences. “Although we were in ongoing conversations with various distributors, the timeline wasn’t aligning with our hopes to make the film available as soon as possible,” Goldblum said in a statement. “We never made the film to sit on it. People need closure, and we hope this release helps communities begin to heal. We are using this film to call for change.” “Big Rock Burning” has premiered at Malibu City Hall. Its festival run includes screenings at Mill Valley Film Festival, Santa Fe International Film Festival, Newport Beach Film Festival and SCAD Savannah Film Festival. As part of the film’s ongoing impact campaign, Goldblum will be a part of a special session with the Council of Global Change at the United Nations Headquarters on Oct. 22 to use the film as a call to action. The session, which includes the World Bank and Malala Fund, will be live on United Nations Web TV. The filmmakers are dedicated to advocating for legislative reform around land management at the local and state levels. Ten percent of all proceeds from the film release will benefit the Boys & Girls Club of Malibu’s Disaster Recovery Services, which is providing long-term, whole-person, trauma-informed care coordination and resources to Pacific Palisades fire survivors. “Big Rock Burning” is produced by Julie Parker Benello (“American Factory,” “Athlete A”) of Secret Sauce Media and James Costa (“The Dating Game,” “Welcome to Chechnya”) of Bird Street Productions, alongside Goldblum. Oscar-winning director Bryan Fogel also serve as executive producers alongside Marilou Hamill, Trevor Burgess, Judith Helfand, Oliver Blank and Meadow Fund.

Brinkman replaces Michael Condrey, who was ousted from 31st Union back in February amid mounting internal criticism of Project Ethos’ progress. In a memo to staff Wednesday, which was provided to Variety by 2K Games , 2K president David Ismailer told 31st Union and 2K Games staff: “The community feedback from last fall’s Project ETHOS playtest was enlightening. It affirmed the promise of a roguelike shooter but told us we still had work to do. It uncovered the need for a more distinct identity. It’s been inspiring to see how far you’ve come.

f77e0f5c62a1,Jim Carrey in Talks to Star in ‘The Jetsons’ Live-Action Movie,,"Jim Carrey is in talks to lead a “Jetsons” movie at Warner Bros. Pictures with Colin Trevorrow in talks to direct, Variety has confirmed. Trevorrow, who last helmed “Jurassic World: Dominion,” and Joe Epstein are in talks to write the screenplay. No information on the storyline was immediately available. The last “Jetsons” feature film was the 1990 animated “Jetsons: The Movie.” A live-action version of the familiar family animated property, which first aired in 1962, has been attempted numerous times over the years. The series was revived several times in the 1970s and ’80s, making the typical nuclear family that happens to live in outer space familiar to several generations of viewers. The story revolved around George and Jane Jetson, their children Judy and Elroy and dog Astro. The family lives in the space-age styled Orbit City and enjoys innovations that were considered wildly futuristic at the time, such as video chat, domestic robots and even flying cars are part of or about to be part of daily life 60 years later. Among the unfulfilled attempts to bring “ The Jetsons ” to screen were a 2003 version directed by Adam Shankman, a 2007 CGI version directed by Robert Rodriguez and a 2017 animated version . Carrey most recently has appeared in “Sonic the Hedgehog” and its two follow-up installments. He has a long history of taking on iconic characters such as the Grinch in “How the Grinch Stole Christmas” but has been seen less frequently onscreen in recent years. Before “Jurassic World: Dominion,” Trevorrow directed “The Book of Henry,” “Jurassic World” and the indie “Safety Not Guaranteed.” Warner Bros. had no comment.",https://variety.com/2025/film/news/jim-carrey-jetsons-live-action-movie-1236553869,Entertainment,variety.com,Pat Saperstein,https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/MixCollage-15-Oct-2025-02-54-PM-6934.jpg?w=1000&h=563&crop=1,2025-10-15T19:04:52+00:00,632952f919edc6d2419c58150bccc6f4b4c19339

65cf1de32cc6,"Apple’s Souped-Up Vision Pro AR/VR Headset Still Costs $3,500, but It May Be the Product’s Last Upgrade for a While",,"In launching the Vision Pro headset last year, Apple touted it as the “ultimate entertainment device,” essentially providing an immersive high-end home theater you wear on your face. But at a list price of $3,500, the AR/VR “spatial computing” product by all accounts has failed to live up the hype and hasn’t sold a significant number of units. Undeterred, Apple has stuck to its road map — for now, at least. On Wednesday, it announced an upgraded version of the Vision Pro with its M5 processor, which “delivers a leap forward in performance, improved display rendering, faster AI-powered workflows and extended battery life,” the company said. The headset still costs $3,499, which is significantly more than the $500 Meta Quest 3 mixed-reality headset. The Vision Pro M5 upgrade could be the last major rev on the headset for several years. Apple has postponed plans to make a lighter and less expensive version of Vision Pro, originally targeted for 2027 release, in favor of focusing on AI-enabled smart glasses to compete with Meta, according to a Bloomberg report earlier this month, citing an internal announcement. (Apple declined to comment on the report.) With the Vision Pro product upgrade, the tech giant is still hoping to make AR/VR experiences a bigger thing — and, Apple claims, the headset “remains the ultimate entertainment device” with a screen “that appears up to 100 feet wide.” With the new model, users can experience immersive concerts with Amplium, and Vision Pro features natively developed apps for streaming services including HBO Max, Disney+ and Paramount+ (but not for Netflix or YouTube). The Apple TV app provides a large selection of 3D movies available to buy and view in Vision Pro, including recent hits like “Superman,” “Jurassic World Rebirth,” “How to Train Your Dragon” and “Wicked.” New series and films on the Apple TV app available on Vision Pro include “Metallica,” “Submerged,” “The Weeknd: Open Hearts” and “VIP: Yankee Stadium.” Later this NBA season, users in the L.A. Lakers’ broadcast territory will be able to watch select live games in Apple Immersive format on the Vision Pro, the company announced. Additionally, new titles from CNN, the Audi F1 Project, the BBC, HYBE and Red Bull will launch for the headset over the next few months. Thanks to the M5 chip, Vision Pro can increase the video refresh rate up to 120Hz for “reduced motion blur” when users look at their physical surroundings. In addition, according to Apple, the 16-core Neural Engine makes AI-powered features run up to 50% for system experiences (like transforming photos into spatial scenes) and up to twice as fast for third-party apps compared with the previous generation. Vision Pro — which is outfitted with 12 cameras, five sensors and six microphones — is able to stream new images to the displays within 12 milliseconds “to create a real-time view of the world.” The new battery now supports up to 2.5 hours of general use and up to 3 hours of video playback on a single charge. Other enhancements to the upgraded Vision Pro include a new dual-knit band (for “an even more comfortable fit”) and visionOS 26, which “unlocks innovative spatial experiences, including widgets, new Personas, an interactive Jupiter Environment, and new Apple Intelligence features with support for additional languages.” For all Apple’s efforts to try to make Vision Pro appealing to consumers, the product may ultimately see its most traction for business applications. In its announcement Wednesday, Apple called out CAE, which specializes in simulation and instruction solutions, as using Vision Pro to help pilots complete training activities outside of traditional flight-training centers. The company said Porsche is using the headsets to let drivers visualize and personalize new vehicles in select showrooms before taking delivery. Apple also cited Visage Imaging’s 3D medical imaging app for Vision Pro, which is being used at hospitals like UC San Diego Health.",https://variety.com/2025/digital/news/apple-vision-pro-headset-m5-upgrade-price-development-paused-1236553756,Entertainment,variety.com,Todd Spangler,https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Apple-Vision-Pro-M5-Chip-Upgrade.png?w=1000&h=563&crop=1,2025-10-15T18:53:22+00:00,c8bb2fca1398aa9a20c412d7982c820065e01c2e

V10 and Vice are behind a new hybrid clip/competition series dubbed “ Clip Bait .” The show pits online videos opposite each other in a tournament, as each clip is judged by a panel of content creators. The “ultimate viral champion” will then be chosen in a “live, interactive finale.” “‘Clip Bait’ is what happens when viral videos stop being watched and start getting judged,” said Vice Studios head of non-scripted development Joe Ingham. “This big, beautiful, bonkers format is part banter, part treasure hunt, and totally participatory. We’ve turned the infinite scroll into a full contact sport, and we cannot wait to unleash it onto a screen near you very soon.” Ingham will exec produce the series for Vice Studios, while John Stevens and Rick de Oliveira are exec pdoducers for V10 Entertainment. Global rights to the series are currently being shopped at the Mipcom international television market. “’Clip Bait’ reimagines the clip series and reality competition formats with immediacy and energy to reflect today’s viral video audiences,” said de Oliveira said. “Our partnership with Vice will deliver a high-stakes competition that seamlessly taps into the way audiences watch, share, and connect.” V10 knows a thing or two about video clips. The Clarion Capital-backed media company acquired “America’s Funniest Home Videos” creator Vin Di Bona Productions, Venture 10 Studio Group,  and Fishbowl Worldwide Media in 2023. That gave V10 a library of more than 2.8 million videos, with an output of 250 hours of original content annually. V10’s library includes 44 owned digital and FAST channels with more than 1600 hours of owned content including “America’s Funniest Home Videos” (36 seasons on ABC), “Follow Me” (Amazon Prime), “Blue Collar Auction” (Peacock), “Totally Funny Kids” and “Totally Funny Animals” (The CW) and “World’s Funniest Videos” (Fox). The company also has “America’s Funniest People” on ABC, Discovery’s “Wild & Weird” and Roku’s “Visionaries with Keanu Reeves & Gard Hollinger.” As for Vice Studio, which is a division of Vice Media, the company’s output includes Sky’s “Gangs of London,” which was recently renewed for a fourth season, a well as another series for Sky, “Atomic.” Vice is also behind the satirical Saoirse Ronan feature “Bad Apples,” which premiered this year at TIFF and was selected for San Sebastián, BFI London and AFI Film Festival. Vice Studios also owns and operates Cuba Pictures, which is behind Channel 5’s “The Rumour” and RTE’s “The Walsh Sisters.” In unscripted, Vice has “Into the Void” (Hulu), “Hollywood Hustler: Glitz, Glam, Scam” (Prime Video), “Pavements” (Mubi), “Bama Rush” (HBO Max), and “Lewis Capaldi: How I’m Feeling Now” (Netflix).",https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/v10-entertainment-vice-studios-video-clip-competition-show-1236553735,Entertainment,variety.com,Michael Schneider,https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/V10-vice.jpg?w=1000&h=563&crop=1,2025-10-15T18:46:45+00:00,64798824c303a7f3ffab4f4cc960f169871d0826
0150bc276399,No Doubt Adds Six Dates to 2026 Residency at Las Vegas’ Sphere,,"After announcing their residency at Las Vegas’ Sphere earlier this month, No Doubt is plotting six additional dates for their 2026 stint in Sin City. The group, consisting of Gwen Stefani , Tony Kanal, Tom Dumont and Adrian Young, will head over to Sin City for what was initially billed as a six-night limited engagement on May 6, 8, 9, 13, 15 and 16. The new dates are set for May 21, 23, 24, 27, 29 and 30. Presale tickets are now live on Ticketmaster . “The opportunity to create a show at Sphere excites me in a new way,” says Stefani in a statement. “The venue is unique and modern and it opens up a whole new visual palette for us to be creative. Doing it with No Doubt feels like going back in time to relive our history, while also creating something new in a way we never could have imagined.” “When we are on stage together playing these songs we feel the magic,” says Dumont. “We are stoked to play together again for our fans, to celebrate their years of love and support.” Young adds, “For anyone who has ever cared or is curious about a No Doubt live concert, this is a special opportunity for that electric band/fan energy exchange in a very unique venue!” Kanal also notes, “There is a beautiful energy that happens when we play together, an electricity I have felt through all of our years. To be able to leave it all on the table each night and take our fans on the insane journey that is Sphere is beyond our wildest dreams.” No Doubt was one of the headline-grabbing performances from Coachella 2024 across both weekends, marking the first time the group performed together since 2015. The quartet followed the Coachella bookings with a performance at the FireAid benefit concert at Los Angeles’ Kia Forum earlier this January. The Sphere residency also marks the first time that a female-fronted act will headline the venue, as previous performers have included Dead & Co., U2, Eagles, Anyma and Backstreet Boys. It would be a return to the Strip for Stefani, who staged her own “Just a Girl: Las Vegas” residency at the Zappos Theater in 2018. Those shows were set to conclude in May 2020, but eight were postponed due to the pandemic and rescheduled for the following year. As for any indication of new No Doubt music, the band hasn’t signaled that they’ll head back to the studio to record the follow-up to their last album, 2012’s “Push and Shove.” During an interview with Nylon following their Coachella performances, Stefani said that she’s “open to anything.” “Well, I don’t have a crystal ball,” she said. “Most things have surprised me in life. One of the things I’ve learned is to be present in the moment and try to absorb what’s happening around me instead of looking ahead.” Fans who previously registered for tickets have access to the new dates starting at 12 p.m. PT today. General tickets will be available starting on Oct. 17 at 10 a.m. PT on Ticketmaster.",https://variety.com/2025/music/news/no-doubt-announces-2026-residency-las-vegas-sphere-1236545053,Entertainment,variety.com,Steven J.

2d6f2f510789,"Penelope Milford, Oscar-Nominated Actress in ‘Coming Home,’ Dies at 77",,"American stage and screen actress Penelope Milford , who was nominated for the Best Supporting Actress Oscar in 1979 for her role in Hal Ashby’s “ Coming Home ,” died Tuesday in Saugerties, N.Y. She was 77. Her death was confirmed by her brother Doug Milford. A cause was not immediately available. Milford’s professional career on the New York stage began in 1971 where she co-starred opposite Richard Gere in an Off-Broadway production of “Long Time Coming and a Long Time Gone,” based upon the life of musician-novelist Richard Farina. In 1972 Milford made her Broadway debut in Julian Barry’s Tony Award-winning play “Lenny.” Three years later Milford received a Drama Desk Featured Actress in a Musical nomination for “Shenandoah.” In that same period, Milford began appearing in films, first playing a role in Norman Mailer’s notorious, edgy, indie film “Maidstone” (1970) and she played a silent-film star in Ken Russell’s 1977 biopic “Valentino.” But it was her turn as Vi Munson in the Oscar-nominated Best Picture “Coming Home” that placed her in the top ranks of Hollywood performers. Nominated for nine Oscars, including her supporting actress nomination, the film won three Oscars, including Best Actress for Jane Fonda and Best Actor for Jon Voight. In 1981 she also appeared in Franco Zeffirelli’s “Endless Love.” In the ’80s, Milford also played several notable roles on television, co-starring with Henry Fonda, Cloris Leachman and Timothy Hutton in the Emmy-winning TV play, “The Oldest Living Graduate” (1980), starring with Leonard Nimoy in the television movie “Seizure: The Story of Kathy Morris” (1980), as well as taking a key role in the landmark TV film about spousal abuse, “The Burning Bed” (1984) which starred Farrah Fawcett and garnered numerous accolades, including a WGA award and a Golden Globe. Reportedly dissatisfied with the entertainment industry, Milford played a few more key roles in acclaimed films such as “Heathers” (1988) and John McNaughton’s gritty 1996 crime shocker “Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer,” which starred Michael Rooker and garnered several international film festival awards. In the 1990s, Milford taught film acting in Chicago and Minneapolis, and in 2003 moved to the Hudson Valley village of Saugerties, where she was an ardent preservationist, restoring a historic residence and serving her local community’s efforts to maintain its storied commercial district and homes. She also performed in local theater, sang in the Bard Symphonic Chorus, and was active in the Woodstock Christian Science church. She is pre-deceased by her brother, actor/singer Richard Kim Milford, and is survived by her sister Candace Saint and her brother Doug Milford.",https://variety.com/2025/film/news/penelope-milford-dead-coming-home-1236553775,Entertainment,variety.com,Steven Gaydos,https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/MSDCOHO_EC014.jpg?crop=299px%2C14px%2C2590px%2C1456px&resize=1000%2C563,2025-10-15T18:33:08+00:00,bac30bf2ae0a35f96e40d1cd16bb32e36f500c58
ca419c0545e6,Netflix’s ‘KPop Demon Hunters’ Returning to Movie Theaters for Halloween Sing-Along Screenings,,"Huntr/x is returning to movie theaters near you. Netflix is bringing “ KPop Demon Hunters ,” an animated fantasy adventure about a fictional K-pop girl group who protect the world from demons with their music, back to the big screen for Halloween-themed sing-along screenings. (Costumes are encouraged, the streamer wrote in a press release.) It’ll play from Oct. 31 through Nov. 2 at all three major U.S. theatrical chains — AMC, Regal and Cinemark — and in select theaters. That’s significant because the nation’s top circuits are usually loath to program films from the theatrical-averse Netflix. To that end, it’s also notable that Netflix is re-releasing its most popular movie in cinemas. For exhibitors, this should be another boon amid a sluggish October at the box office. All that’s otherwise currently scheduled to open around Halloween is Yorgos Lanthimos and Emma Stone’s twisted thriller “Bugonia” and a “Twilight” re-release. “KPop Demon Hunters” topped the box office in late August, generating a surprisingly strong estimated $18 million when a sing-along edition was initially released in theaters for two days. It was unusual that Netflix scheduled “KPop Demon Hunters” on the big screen in the first place — not just because the company doesn’t prioritize theatrical, but because the movie had debuted on the streaming platform about two months prior. But since June, “KPop Demon Hunters” has become Netflix’s most popular release ever while three of its original songs — “Golden,” “Your Idol” and “Soda Pop” — have been mainstays on Billboard’s Hot 100 chart. A theatrical event helps drive fans back to the platform for re-watches and the forthcoming sequel . AMC Theatres, the world’s largest circuit, was the only major chain that didn’t play the film the first time around. Now “KPop Demon Hunters” will screen at approximately 400 AMC locations across the U.S. and Europe. And AMC seems to be softening its stance against Netflix, meaning this might not be the last collaboration between the world’s largest theater chain and the biggest streaming platform. (AMC played “Glass Onion: A Knives Out Mystery” in 2022 but otherwise has avoided scheduling Netflix releases because the two companies don’t agree on the length of time a movie should remain exclusively in theaters.) “While the two companies have not had a commercial relationship in recent years, both Netflix and AMC are intrigued by the mutually beneficial opportunities that could arise from this and future collaboration,” a spokesperson for AMC Theatres said in a statement. “Discussions are underway as to what that may entail, but no further details are being shared at this time.”",https://variety.com/2025/film/news/kpop-demon-hunters-movie-theaters-halloween-screenings-1236553788,Entertainment,variety.com,Rebecca Rubin,https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/KpopDemonHunters_ProRes422HQ_SDR_2ch_20250424.00_25_52_12_L-1.jpg?w=1000&h=563&crop=1,2025-10-15T18:18:26+00:00,6d6a0b79d5a69383482591cfa580f54da500dd15
a13796986e94,When government websites become campaign tools: Blaming the shutdown on Democrats has legal and political risks,"democracy, democrats, governance, government shutdown, hatch act, propaganda, republicans, federal agencies","For decades, federal shutdowns have mostly been budget fights. The 2025 one has become bigger than that: It’s turned into a messaging war. Official government communications , including website banners, out-of-office email replies and autogenerated responses that denounce “Senate Democrats,” “the Radical Left” or “Democrats’ $1.5 trillion wishlist” for closing the government, mark a sharp break from past practice. These messages are more than rhetorical escalation. Many may violate the Hatch Act , the 1939 statute that limits partisan political activity by federal employees and agencies. They also represent new tests for how far a White House can push the bounds of campaign-style messaging while also claiming to govern. In any democracy, power lies not only in who writes the laws or signs the budgets but in who shapes the story . Communication is not an afterthought or byproduct of governance. It is one of its essential instruments. Political narrative helps citizens understand who’s responsible, who’s acting in good faith and who’s to blame. The 2025 shutdown has turned that truth into strategy. Federal communication systems – agency websites, automated emails and public information portals – are being used to persuade rather than inform. It’s a move that is both politically risky and legally perilous. Serve the public, not a party The Hatch Act was passed during the Great Depression, after years of concern that federal agencies were being used improperly as political machines . Its goal was simple: to ensure that public servants worked for the American people, not for the party in power. At its core, the Hatch Act prohibits executive branch federal employees – except for the president and vice president – from engaging in partisan political activity as part of their official duties or under their official authority. Government workers may not use their positions or public resources to influence elections, coerce individual behavior or engage in political advocacy. The law requires federal agencies to avoid the partisan fray and focus on serving the public rather than political agendas. The Office of Special Counsel , which enforces the law, has been clear on this point. “The purpose of the Act,” says an Office of Special Counsel guide written for federal employees, “is to maintain a federal workforce that is free from partisan political influence or coersion.” Government communication can inform, but it cannot campaign. An auto-reply to an email sent to the press staff at the U.S. Department of Education on Oct. 14, 2025. CC BY Yet the shutdown has already produced multiple potential violations: • The Department of Education, according to a lawsuit, altered employees’ email auto-responses – without consent – to say things like “the Democrats have shut the government down.” Such changes do more than convey impartial information. They compel employees to align themselves with institutionally imposed scripts. • Likewise, agencies including Health and Human Services and the Small Business Administration reportedly distributed or directed staff to adopt partisan out-of-office auto-replies assigning blame to Democrats . • The Department of Housing and Urban Development posted a banner on its official website stating that the “ Radical Left are going to shut down the government .” Taken individually, each incident might provoke a Hatch Act complaint. Collectively, they amount to a systematic campaign to transform nonpartisan federal agencies into partisan political messengers. The message on the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development homepage, Oct. 14, 2025. U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development Why this is unprecedented What sets the 2025 messaging apart isn’t just its volume – it’s the scale, the coordination and the brazenness of its political targeting. In past shutdowns , partisan spin lived mostly in press conferences and campaign talking points. Agencies themselves, even under pressure, stayed neutral. This time, the administration is using the machinery of government to deliver partisan blame. The timing and similarity of messages across departments seems coordinated. Housing and Urban Development posted a banner blaming Democrats the day before the shutdown began. Within hours, other agencies followed using nearly identical language. More troubling are the reported changes to federal employees’ auto-replies without their consent . These missives forced career civil servants, many of them furloughed, to become unwilling messengers for partisan ends. Federal agencies and their workers are supposed to serve everyone, not only those who support the party in power. And because the watchdogs who could enforce the legal boundary are also sidelined – the Office of Special Counsel is furloughed  – complaints have nowhere to go , at least for now. They simply land in unattended email inboxes. Legal challenges and limits Whether shutdown communications truly violate the Hatch Act – or related laws – is not yet clear. The administration could argue that it’s not campaigning but merely explaining why services are suspended. As a scholar of political communication and American democracy , I believe that defense weakens when official messages explicitly assign partisan blame or name a political party. And not every political statement is a Hatch Act violation. The law allows employees to express views off duty or in private contexts , so long as they use their own phones and computers. Even if the Office of Special Counsel later finds violations, harm will likely persist. Once messages are posted or auto-replies sent, their effects can’t always be undone. And because ethics officials are furloughed, too, accountability will be delayed, if it comes at all . Some employees are likely to claim their speech rights were violated by being forced to send partisan messages. This is an argument already at the heart of the lawsuit filed by the American Federation of Government Employees against the Education Department. Doors at the Internal Revenue Service in a Seattle federal building are locked and a sign advises that the office will be closed during the 2018-2019 partial government shutdown. AP Photo/Elaine Thompson Why this matters Federal agencies exist to administer laws impartially and to do so on behalf of the people. When the government uses its own infrastructure for partisan messaging, the very neutrality on which democratic governance depends erodes. It dilutes public trust in the idea of a neutral state. The damage also extends into the future. If the current administration succeeds in turning its administrative machinery into a political weapon, without consequence, a precedent will be created. Future presidents may be tempted to follow suit , making acceptable the use of taxpayer-funded systems as campaign tools. And because enforcement bodies such as the Office of Special Counsel also are sidelined during a shutdown, accountability has to wait. That creates an asymmetry of power : One side gets to amplify its message through government channels in real time, while its opponents must wait for the system to restart just to file a complaint. By the time they can, the moment will have passed and the political narrative is likely to have already hardened. Crises demand explanation, even blame. Citizens expect their leaders to tell them what went wrong. But they also expect honesty and fairness in how that story is told . The administration’s messaging strategy during this shutdown tests whether government communication remains a public service or becomes another instrument of political power.",https://theconversation.com/when-government-websites-become-campaign-tools-blaming-the-shutdown-on-democrats-has-legal-and-political-risks-267086,Society,theconversation.com,Stephanie A.

In separate press briefings Tuesday, a network of terminated CDC staff that goes by the name the National Public Health Coalition, and the union representing employees at the agency discussed what the wide-scale cuts mean for the American people, as well as the trauma, despair, and damage they have wreaked on the workers of the once-premier public health agency. In a normal federal layoff—called a reduction in force, or RIF—the agency would be given a full outline of the roles and branches or divisions affected, as well as some explanation for the cuts, such as alleged fraud, abuse, or redundancy. But, the Trump administration has provided no such information or explanation, leaving current and former employees to essentially crowd source what has been lost and only guess at the possible reasons. The numbers The union representing CDC workers, the American Federation of Government Employees (AFGE) Local 2883, has been assessing the cuts since termination emails began arriving in employee inboxes late Friday. The union estimates that the Trump administration sent termination notices to 1,300 CDC employees on Friday, in what they called an illegal ""politically-motivated stunt."" Of those 1,300 terminations, around 700 were rescinded, beginning on Saturday. The Trump administration said the 700 rescinded terminations were sent due to a ""coding error."" But CDC workers didn't buy that explanation, saying all the terminations were intentional, and some were only reversed after backlash erupted when people realized what the administration was trying to cut—for example, terminating the experts responding to domestic measles outbreaks and those responding to an Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo who received RIF notices that were later rescinded. Still, with the rescissions, some 600 terminations appear to remain.",https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/10/cdc-tormented-hr-workers-summoned-from-furlough-to-lay-off-themselves-others,Innovation,arstechnica.com,,https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/GettyImages-2228551722-1152x648.jpg,2025-10-15T19:23:54+00:00,dbf4cd23a6ccd11a8512792d825d5f89c69343a8

Through the API (for developers), the small model is priced at $1 per million input tokens and $5 per million output tokens. That compares to Sonnet 4.5 at $3 per million input and $15 per million output tokens, and Opus 4.1 at $15 per million input and $75 per million output tokens. The model serves as a cheaper drop-in replacement for two older models, Haiku 3.5 and Sonnet 4. ""Users who rely on AI for real-time, low-latency tasks like chat assistants, customer service agents, or pair programming will appreciate Haiku 4.5’s combination of high intelligence and remarkable speed,"" Anthropic writes . Claude 4.5 Haiku answers the classic Ars Technica AI question, ""Would the color be called 'magenta' if the town of Magenta didn't exist?"" On SWE-bench Verified , a test that measures performance on coding tasks, Haiku 4.5 scored 73.3 percent compared to Sonnet 4's similar performance level (72.7 percent). The model also reportedly surpasses Sonnet 4 at certain tasks like using computers , according to Anthropic's benchmarks. Claude Sonnet 4.5, released in late September, remains Anthropic's frontier model and what the company calls ""the best coding model available."" Haiku 4.5 also surprisingly edges up close to what OpenAI's GPT-5 can achieve in this particular set of benchmarks (as seen in the chart above), although since the results are self-reported and potentially cherry-picked to match a model's strengths, one should always take them with a grain of salt. Still, making a small, capable coding model may have unexpected advantages for agentic coding setups like Claude Code . Anthropic designed Haiku 4.5 to work alongside Sonnet 4.5 in multi-model workflows. In such a configuration, Anthropic says, Sonnet 4.5 could break down complex problems into multi-step plans, then coordinate multiple Haiku 4.5 instances to complete subtasks in parallel, like spinning off workers to get things done faster.

Gavin Newsom signed a bill that aims to increase broadband competition in apartment buildings. The new law taking effect on January 1 says landlords must let tenants ""opt out of paying for any subscription from a third-party Internet service provider, such as through a bulk-billing arrangement, to provide service for wired Internet, cellular, or satellite service that is offered in connection with the tenancy."" It was approved by the state Assembly in a 75–0 vote in April, and by the Senate in a 30–7 vote last month. ""This is kind of like a first step in trying to give this industry an opportunity to just treat people fairly,"" Assemblymember Rhodesia Ransom, a Democratic lawmaker who authored the bill, told Ars last month . ""It's not super restrictive. We are not banning bulk billing. We're not even limiting how much money the people can make. What we're saying here with this bill is that if a tenant wants to opt out of the arrangement, they should be allowed to opt out."" Ransom said lobby groups for Internet providers and real estate companies were ""working really hard"" to defeat the bill.

Complaining that property owners would have ""to provide a refund to tenants who decline the Internet service provided through the building's contract with a specific Internet service provider,"" the cable group said the law ""undermines the basis of the cost savings and will lead to bulk billing being phased out.""

Published On 15 Oct 2025 15 Oct 2025 Click here to share on social media share2 Share A United States federal judge in California has ordered President Donald Trump’s administration to halt mass layoffs during a partial government shutdown while she considers claims by unions that the job cuts are illegal. During a hearing in San Francisco on Wednesday, US District Judge Susan Illston granted a request by two unions to block layoffs at more than 30 agencies pending further litigation. Recommended Stories list of 4 items end of list Her ruling came shortly after White House Budget Director Russell Vought said on “The Charlie Kirk Show” that more than 10,000 federal workers could lose their jobs because of the shutdown, which entered its 15th day on Wednesday. Illston at the hearing cited a series of public statements by Trump and Vought that she said showed explicit political motivations for the layoffs, such as Trump saying that cuts would target “Democrat agencies”. “You can’t do that in a nation of laws. And we have laws here, and the things that are being articulated here are not within the law,” said Illston, an appointee of Democratic former President Bill Clinton, adding that the cuts were being carried out without much thought. “It’s very much ready, fire, aim on most of these programs, and it has a human cost,” she said. “It’s a human cost that cannot be tolerated.” Illston said she agreed with the unions that the administration was unlawfully using the lapse in government funding that began October 1 to carry out its agenda of downsizing the federal government. A US Department of Justice lawyer, Elizabeth Hedges, said she was not prepared to address Illston’s concerns about the legality of the layoffs. She instead argued that the unions must bring their claims to a federal labour board before going to court. ‘Won’t negotiate’ The judge’s decision came after federal agencies on Friday started issuing layoff notices aimed at reducing the size of the federal government. The layoff notices are part of an effort by Trump’s Republican administration to exert more pressure on Democratic lawmakers as the government shutdown continues. Democratic lawmakers are demanding that any deal to reopen the federal government address their healthcare demands. Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson predicted the shutdown may become the longest in history, saying he “won’t negotiate” with Democrats until they hit pause on those demands and reopen. Democrats have demanded that healthcare subsidies, first put in place in 2021 and extended a year later, be extended again. They also want any government funding bill to reverse the Medicaid cuts in Trump’s big tax breaks and spending cuts bill that was passed earlier this year. About 4,100 workers at eight agencies have been notified that they are being laid off so far, according to a Tuesday court filing by the administration. The Trump administration has been paying the military and pursuing its crackdown on immigration while slashing jobs in health and education, including in special education and after-school programmes. Trump said programmes favoured by Democrats are being targeted and “they’re never going to come back, in many cases.” The American Federation of Government Employees and American Federation of State, County, and Municipal Employees claim that implementing layoffs is not an essential service that can be performed during a lapse in government funding, and that the shutdown does not justify mass job cuts because most federal workers have been furloughed without pay.",https://www.aljazeera.com/economy/2025/10/15/us-judge-temporarily-blocks-trump-plan-to-fire-thousands-of-govt-workers,World,aljazeera.com,,https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/afp_68dd8508766e-1759347976.jpg?resize=1920%2C1440,,4a63f5b3b2c7035c7f3f85a873e25ed1a43aa13d
31ee85ff5715,UN calls for Israel to open more Gaza crossings for surge in aid deliveries,"news, gaza, united nations, israel, middle east, palestine","The United Nations humanitarian chief, Tom Fletcher, has urged Israel to immediately open more crossings into the famine-stricken Gaza Strip to allow for a surge in aid deliveries. In remarks to reporters on Wednesday, Fletcher said that the UN is seeking a dramatic boost in humanitarian aid for Gaza, saying the hundreds of relief trucks cleared to enter the devastated enclave were nowhere near the thousands needed to ease a humanitarian disaster. Recommended Stories list of 3 items end of list Thousands of humanitarian vehicles must enter weekly to avert further catastrophe, he told the Reuters news agency. “We have 190,000 metric tonnes of provisions on the borders waiting to go in and we’re determined to deliver. That’s essential life-saving food and nutrition,” Fletcher said. Israel’s two-year war on Gaza has displaced almost all of the Strip’s 2.2 million residents from their homes, and famine is present in the north, global monitors say. Vast swaths of the coastal territory have been reduced to a wasteland by Israeli bombardments and air strikes that have killed nearly 68,000 Palestinians, according to Palestinian health authorities. Rights groups and a UN commission of inquiry have accused Israel of committing genocide in the war. Israel has denied the allegations. US President Donald Trump and regional leaders on Monday signed a declaration in the Egyptian resort of Sharm el-Sheikh to cement a ceasefire deal. The resumption of aid deliveries is listed as a provision in Trump’s 20-point plan for ending the war on Gaza. Al Jazeera’s Hani Mahmoud, reporting from Gaza City, said the Israeli army retained control of parts of the city. “Large areas of Gaza City and the north remain under firm control of the Israeli military,” Mahmoud said. “Armoured vehicles and tanks are still stationed in the eastern parts of the city, preventing many residents from going back to their homes.” “No aid is reaching Gaza City, not even from the 300 trucks that were promised entry. Major roads have been destroyed or blocked by rubble from collapsed buildings, especially high-rises, cutting off key access routes in and out of the city,” Mahmoud added. Meanwhile, Israeli forces have continued to sporadically attack various parts of Gaza despite the ceasefire, killing at least three people since dawn on Wednesday, according to medical sources. Gaza’s Health Ministry said hospitals in Gaza received at least 11 other bodies, including eight recovered from rubble and three who succumbed to injuries from earlier attacks. ‘Unhindered access’ Israeli officials said 600 trucks have been approved to enter the blockaded territory under the current US-brokered truce deal. Fletcher called the announcement of 600 trucks a “good base” but said it was not enough to meet the scale of need. He called for more than 50 international NGOs, including Oxfam and the Norwegian Refugee Council, to be allowed to bring in aid, saying the issue has been raised with Israel, the United States and other regional partners. “We cannot deliver the scale necessary without their presence and their engagement. So we want to see them back in. We are advocating on their behalf,” he said. “We’ve been calling for unhindered access,” Fletcher told the AFP news agency, adding: “It should happen now. We want it to happen immediately as part of this [ceasefire] agreement.” Fletcher said the looting of aid trucks had dropped sharply in recent days as deliveries increased. “If you’re only getting in 60 trucks a day, desperate, hungry people will attack those trucks. The way to stop the looting is to deliver aid at massive scale and get the private sector and commercial markets operating again.” The Palestinian Authority (PA), which governs in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, has meanwhile said it is prepared to operate the Rafah crossing, which it previously did with EU assistance. Fletcher welcomed the PA’s offer to play a role in reopening the crossing. He said medical evacuations through the crossing would be a priority, citing recent talks with Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi and PA President Mahmoud Abbas. The Rafah crossing remained shut on Wednesday, despite reports that it could reopen to aid convoys, as Israel insisted Hamas hand over the remains of the last deceased Israeli captives that were held by Palestinian groups in Gaza, as agreed in the truce deal. In a statement on Wednesday night, the Palestinian group’s armed wing said it has abided by the terms of the agreement, handing over all living captives in their custody, as well as the bodies they were able to retrieve. The group added that locating and recovering the remaining bodies would require extensive effort and specialised equipment, and that it is continuing to make efforts towards that end. Gaza’s Health Ministry announced on Wednesday that it received the bodies of 45 Palestinians who had been held in Israeli custody through the International Committee of the Red Cross, bringing the total number returned to 90.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/15/un-calls-for-israel-to-open-more-gaza-crossings-for-surge-in-aid-deliveries,World,aljazeera.com,,https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/afp_68ef985e9771-1760532574.jpg?resize=1920%2C1440,,cbce7ba4963f7af8526579545a58e9d6b5bebc08

Published On 15 Oct 2025 15 Oct 2025 Click here to share on social media share2 Share A  judge in Peru has rejected a bid to prevent former President Dina Boluarte from leaving the country while state prosecutors investigate her for alleged abuse of office and money laundering. Boluarte, one of the world’s least popular leaders, was ousted from the presidency last week when Congress voted 122 to zero in favour of her removal. Recommended Stories list of 3 items end of list She left office with approval ratings ranging between 2 and 4 percent amid growing unrest over insecurity, as transport workers and young people protested rising extortions and murders. On Wednesday, Judge Fernando Valdez struck down the request from Peru’s State Prosecutor’s Office in a hearing, arguing that Boluarte did not present a flight risk and the request was “unfounded”. Boluarte, who faces a series of criminal accusations, has denied wrongdoing. Prosecutors had sought to prevent Boluarte from leaving the country over investigations that she allegedly collected money from a criminal group and failed to notify Congress during a surgery. In the latter case, Boluarte is accused of abandoning her post for two weeks in July 2023 while she underwent a rhinoplasty. Prosecutors say she did not notify Congress, nor appoint a caretaker president. Other allegations concern questions of corruption: There has been scrutiny over the origins of her collection of luxury Rolex watches. Her government is also accused of using excessive force against the deadly protests that erupted in support of her predecessor, Pedro Castillo, who was also impeached and removed from office in December 2022. On the night of her removal from office last week, a crowd had gathered outside Ecuador’s embassy in Lima amid speculation that Boluarte could seek asylum with the neighbouring country.

a78ce6dacbd6,REM sleep may reshape what we remember,,"The amount of REM sleep you get may influence which details of your memories remain in storage, a new brain study suggests. Previous research had found that sleep helps fortify our memories , but the question of how it shapes the contents of these memories has been harder to pin down. Now, a study published Oct. 1 in the journal Communications Biology hints that the time spent in different stages of sleep may influence this aspect of memory storage. The sleep cycle is split into four stages: one stage of rapid eye movement (REM) and three non-REM stages, including ""deep sleep,"" marked by slow brain waves. To test how these sleep stages impact our memories, the researchers asked 32 healthy young adults to learn 96 word-picture pairs — such as an action word linked to an image of an animal or plant — while their brain activity was recorded with an electroencephalogram (EEG), which monitors brain waves that wash over the surface of the brain. The volunteers were then monitored with EEG as they slept overnight and had their recall tested the next morning. The researchers compared the before-and-after brain patterns using a technique called representational similarity analysis. These data enabled the scientists to focus both on detailed memories tied to specific images — like a photo of a beagle — and on broader, categorical memories, covering all the animal images, for instance. ""By using EEG, we could track how brain activity linked to memories changed from before to after sleep,"" first study author Jing Liu , a research assistant professor at The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, told Live Science in an email. The team uncovered a pattern: Brainwaves linked to the individual images weakened after sleep, while the broader category signals remained stable. The shift was stronger when REM made up more of an individual's total sleep time, compared to deep sleep. Liu explained that this pattern suggests REM sleep may help the brain link new memories with what it already knows, while slow-wave sleep helps keep those memories in their original, more-detailed form. Get the world’s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox. ""Even when people remembered the same things after waking, the brain patterns behind those memories had shifted,"" she added. This suggests sleep not only strengthens memories but may reorganize how they're represented in the brain, with REM and slow-wave sleep contributing in different ways. Together, these results add to evidence that memory consolidation — the brain's process of stabilizing and reorganizing new memories — involves both preservation and transformation. Rather than storing memories of experiences exactly as they happened, the brain may be subtly restructuring them during sleep, balancing accuracy with generalization. The distinction, the researchers noted, could help explain how knowledge networks in the brain evolve over time. However, the pattern doesn't necessarily mean that deep sleep and REM sleep work in opposition to one another. Rather, the two phases support different facets of remembering, Dr. George Dragoi , professor of psychiatry and neuroscience at Yale University who was not involved in the study, told Live Science in an email. ""The results here point to a complementary role of REM and slow-wave sleep in different types of memory,"" he said, such as general knowledge and facts versus memories of specific experiences. He added that keeping regular sleep schedules may help support these processes, since good sleep quality is broadly linked to healthy cognitive function. ""Longer REM periods may promote the kind of memory transformation this study highlights,"" he suggested. Liu, however, cautioned that the results show associations, not causation. ""[EEG] prevents us from precisely identifying the brain regions driving these changes,"" she said, adding that combining EEG with recordings taken directly from electrodes placed inside the skull could clarify the circuitry behind the effect. She also pointed to future studies that might try to reactivate specific memories during sleep — for instance, by replaying sounds or cues linked to earlier learning — or interrupt particular sleep stages to see whether that changes how flexibly people can use what they've learned.

20313d3d4dc4,"NBA's most underrated players: Josh Hart, Trey Murphy and a former MVP make the list",,"We all have our favorites. Every year, the NBA staff at CBS Sports ranks the 100 best players in the league. And every year, inevitably, each of us has a player or two that we ranked substantially higher than everyone else. Maybe it's a young player we expect to grow. Maybe it's someone on a team we happen to watch more than others. Maybe it's a player who's been stuck in the wrong circumstances but is primed for a breakout. Or maybe it's just irrational faith. But it's a central part of the basketball-viewing experience. We all have players that we simply believe in more than anyone else. So this year, we're going to put our metaphorical money where our mouths are. Each of us decided to highlight one player that we ranked higher than all or most of the rest of the voters. Below, we will explain what we see in those players that the rest of the basketball world does not. These are the players that our staff consider to be the most underrated in the NBA going into the 2025-26 season. NBA Top 100 players, ranked: How Nikola Jokić, SGA, Luka Dončić and more stack up as new season begins Sam Quinn Trey Murphy, Pelicans The Pelicans are so cursed that the one reasonably consistent part of their team is by far the most overlooked. Trey Murphy isn't the predestined franchise player battling conditioning issues like Zion Williamson . He's not the ace defender with wildly fluctuating shooting percentages like Herb Jones. He's really the only young player in New Orleans who has simply arrived and progressed in a somewhat linear fashion towards potential stardom. You can count on one hand how many players combine his shooting and athleticism, and with so many teammates missing time last season, Murphy, No. 72 on our list, got his first taste of a star-caliber work load. He handled it with aplomb, largely maintaining his efficiency despite increased volume while getting to the line and assisting at career-best rates. Things may be rough in New Orleans, but Murphy is the diamond waiting to be mined from this mess. -- Sam Quinn There's been so much discussion about the Nuggets ' offseason acquisitions to boost their depth that it seems like everyone has forgotten about Braun, who snuck on to our list at No. 95. He was awesome last season in a breakout campaign in which he averaged an extremely efficient 15.4 points on 58/39.7/82.7 shooting splits. Only four other players in the league averaged at least 15 points on 58% shooting or better last season, and they were all centers: Giannis Antetokounmpo , Domantas Sabonis , Mark Williams and Ivica Zubac . Braun is an excellent cutter and finishes everything in transition, which makes him a perfect partner for Nikola Jokić. No Nuggets teammates played more minutes together than Braun and Jokić, and when they were on the floor Denver had a plus-11.8 net rating. The big question for Braun and the Nuggets is whether he can become a more consistent outside shooter. He shot 39.7% last season, but only took 2.8 attempts per game; in the playoffs, when teams dared him to beat them, he made just 29.6% of 5.1 attempts per game. -- Jack Maloney I anticipate a minutes bump and an All-Defense nod for Thompson this season, and I bet he'll be much higher on next year's list. Yes, his poor shooting is a problem, but, fortunately, he's awesome at pretty much everything else. Few defenders are as much of a menace one-on-one, and his feel for the game on both ends is exceptional. Thompson, ranked 75th on our list, gets ridiculous rebounds, and the Pistons plan to put him on the ball a lot more this season , which means everybody will get to see that he has much more to offer on offense than his cutting in the halfcourt and his speed in transition. -- James Herbert I understand why the ranking on Embiid was so varied, given injuries have to factor into these projections. That said, if Embiid can get back to even playing 50+ games this season (certainly a big if), I think 26 is far lower than he belongs. He is one of the most dominant forces in the game when he's functional, and as he ramps up for the regular season, the hope is he's closer to the level we saw before his latest knee injury in 2023-24. I don't know if we'll ever see the MVP-level Embiid again, but even if he's 85% of the player he was at his peak, he's among the game's best bigs. This is a player who averaged north of 30 points and 10 rebounds per game for three straight seasons (while providing high-end rim protection). Perhaps I'm wish-casting a bit here, but I really hope we see at least one more run of Embiid near his best because he is one of the most unique, talented forces the league has ever seen. -- Robby Kalland Maybe Josh Hart's problem is that he's too easy to forget. Or at least he's severely undervalued. But this guy -- ranked 94th in our Top 100 -- does everything for the Knicks . I could've made the argument that he was New York's second-most important player last season. You might not agree, but I assure you on a lot of nights it's an honest argument. He swings so many games with his rebounding, pace pushing, end-to-end buckets, et cetera. We all love to focus on some of the lineup limitations he brings because of his shooting inconsistencies, but bottom line is Hart can be a borderline top-50 player when it comes down to impacting winning. -- Brad Botkin",https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/nbas-most-underrated-players-josh-hart-trey-murphy-and-a-former-mvp-make-the-list,Sport,cbssports.com,,https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2025/10/15/7ac455b5-b70f-40ca-bef8-71a62353115b/thumbnail/1200x675/34d1af2e100895c343b2d89f9e739169/josh-hart-imagn-1.png,2025-10-15T20:22:45+00:00,944577d9cd1122b793ceac4e597ad492cd0010af

""Today, I officially begin my transition out of my basketball career,"" he said in a statement . ""I have proudly given my mind, body, and spirit to the game over the last few decades. With the many sacrifices it took to get here, I have received many rewards. I am deeply grateful to have arrived to this point on my own terms and now to be able to reap the benefits of my career with my family and friends. Thank you, from the bottom of my heart, to all who have had a place in my journey."" Brogdon signed a one-year deal with the Knicks last month. He appeared in line to be a part of the team's backcourt depth plans behind Jalen Brunson and Josh Hart and had played in all four of the team's preseason games. New York also has Miles McBride and Jordan Clarkson , among others, though Brogdon's ability to play both guard spots could have proven helpful. The Knicks, in their first season under coach Mike Brown, are +410 to win the Eastern Conference (via FanDuel ), with only the Cleveland Cavaliers (+200) having shorter odds. The Milwaukee Bucks selected Brogdon 36th overall in the 2016 NBA Draft out of Virginia, and he won Rookie of the Year thanks to a stellar debut. After three seasons in Milwaukee, he was traded to the Indiana Pacers for several picks. Following three years in Indiana -- including the 2020-21 season in which he averaged a career-high 21.2 points per game -- he was traded to the Boston Celtics . In Boston, he became a full-time bench player for the first time in his career, and it worked out very well, as he won Sixth Man of the Year in 2023. He is one of just two players in NBA history to win both Rookie of the Year and Sixth Man of the Year. Brogdon then headed to the Portland Trail Blazers in the deal that netted the Celtics Jrue Holiday before being traded to the Washington Wizards as part of the Deni Avdija deal after just one year in the Pacific Northwest. Injuries hampered Brogdon throughout his career and he appeared in just 63 games over the past two seasons, but he was productive when he was able to play. He averaged double-digit points in all nine of his NBA seasons and finishes his career with career averages of 15.3 points, 4.7 assists and 4.1 rebounds per game as well as a 38.8% mark from 3-point range.",https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/former-rookie-of-the-year-sixth-man-malcolm-brogdon-announces-retirement-one-week-before-knicks-season-opener,Sport,cbssports.com,,https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2025/10/15/f30ca9fc-5465-4f00-9f43-778e13e7f9bd/thumbnail/1200x675/5e394dd731c84abc7198ed3119f94aea/malcolm-brogdon-knicks.jpg,2025-10-15T20:22:38+00:00,df41df6850a3ec609eab17d063d867f1bb0811b1
22f7737e2fd7,WATCH: USWNT midfielder Lily Yohannes scores stunning goal from near midfield in UEFA Women's Champions League,,"Getty Images Lily Yohannes is showing off her prodigious talent in the 2025-26 UEFA Women's Champions League. The 18-year-old scored a remarkable goal from near the halfway line in a 3-0 victory for OL Lyonnes on Matchday 2 on Wednesday against St. Pölten. The young American signed with the French powerhouse in July and is rapidly making her mark with the club, scoring in the domestic league and now the Europe's most prestigious competition. Her move to eight-time Champions League winners Lyon signals the next step in her development, and her distant goal comes just hours after she was recently named to the USWNT October roster by Emma Hayes . Yohannes also scored in her club debut in a win against Marseille in September. Her rise in the women's game is no secret as she's no stranger to the European stage. As just 16 years old, she became the youngest player to ever start a UWCL group stage match during her time with Ajax, making her also the youngest American to ever play in the tournament. Her creativity and poise in the midfield earned her the Johan Cruyff Talent of the Year award. OL head coach Jonatan Giraldez is already utilizing the young player in a starting capacity, and the teenager has a bright future ahead of her. OL Lyonnes will play their next Champions League in November and will face the Frauen Bundesliga team Wolfsburg at home in Groupama Stadium.

Following Sunday's loss, Tagovailoa publicly called out teammates for either being late to or not attending players-only meetings. Tagogvailoa said that, while those comments were well-intended, he realizes now that it created an unneeded distraction for a Dolphins team that enters this Sunday's game against the Browns with a 1-5 record. ""I made a mistake, and I'm owning up to that right now,"" Tagovailoa said . The Dolphins' former Pro Bowl quarterback said that he has spoken to the team's other leaders about his comments while adding that they ""know that my intent was right."" ""The intent can be right,"" he said, ""but when things get misconstrued or however the media wants to portray it, that leaves a void of silence and a lot of questions for the guys on our team now."" In addition to adding to the outside noise, Tagovailoa also acknowledged that he didn't protect the locker room by airing the team's business publicly. ""I felt like I let the emotions of the game get to me after the game,"" he said. ""That's something that I can learn from as a leader on this team. What happens in-house should be protected, and none of that should have gotten out. And so want to publicly apologize about that. Want to move forward and focus on the Cleveland Browns."" As Tagovailoa surely knows, winning can cure a lot of things for a struggling team.

d87a7844b393,Breece Hall landing spots: Where talented Jets RB could be dealt before NFL trade deadline,,"The New York Jets are in free fall, off to an 0-6 under first-year coach Aaron Glenn. New York's 2025 0-6 start is just the third such winless beginning to a season in team history along with the 1996 season (0-7) and the 2020 season (0-13). The Jets will certainly be in the midst of a rebuild next offseason or two, which puts the future of talented, 24-year-old running back Breece Hall up in the air. The 2022 second-round pick is set to become a free agent next offseason, and the team drafted promising Wisconsin running back Braelon Allen in the fourth round of the 2024 NFL Draft a year ago. New York is projected to have the seventh-most effective cap space ($58.2 million) in the NFL next offseason, according to OverTheCap.com, but there's a decent chance the franchise won't prioritize that money on a running back next year with plenty of other holes to address. That's why it would make sense for the Jets to at least shop Hall around to see what they could get for the talented, well-rounded back. Which teams would make the most sense for Hall? Here is a look at five possible landing spots for the young running back ahead of the NFL's Nov. 4 trade deadline. Alvin Kamara to Chiefs? New WR for Giants' Jaxson Dart? 10 NFL trades that should happen before 2025 deadline Cody Benjamin The Chiefs could use more juice on offense, including an upgrade at running back since quarterback Patrick Mahomes is currently Kansas City's leading rusher with 222 yards this season. Isiah Pacheco has rushed for under 55 yards in every game this season, and he's gone 12 consecutive games without a rushing touchdown. He's second on the team in rushing with 214 yards this season. New York would certainly be happy to absorb as many draft picks as it can get amid a rebuild, and the Chiefs are obviously in win-now mode. Following an encouraging 30-17 victory over the Detroit Lions on ""Sunday Night Football"" in Week 6, this is a deal that Kansas City should look to make. The Chargers offense is as beaten down with injuries as it gets with offensive tackle Rashawn Slater (torn patellar tendon, out for the season), offensive tackle Joe Alt (ankle), running back Omarion Hampton (ankle, on injured reserve) and wide receiver Derius Davis (knee) all wounded. Quarterback Justin Herbert could use some assistance, especially a reliable checkdown release valve out of the backfield given his ragged offensive line. Hall could aid Herbert and the Chargers both in the ground game and through the air. Hall's 150 catches and 1,224 yards receiving since 2023 are both the second most in the entire NFL among running backs in that span while his seven receiving touchdowns in that time are tied for the fifth most at the position with Saquon Barkley . Los Angeles needs to inquire about Hall, especially since Hampton is on a rookie deal. Plus, he could be a nice mentor for their first-round rookie back. The Pittsburgh Steelers are all in on the 2025 season after signing 41-year-old quarterback Aaron Rodgers , signing 34-year-old cornerback Darius Slay , trading for soon-to-be 31-year-old cornerback Jalen Ramsey and trading for 30-year-old tight end Jonnu Smith . This is a team in win-now mode, and that approach is working for Pittsburgh thus far with the Steelers out to a 4-1 start and in first place in the AFC North. However, the Steelers currently have the fourth-worst run game in football, averaging just 84.0 yards rushing per game through six weeks. That's surprising considering Pittsburgh offensive coordinator Arthur Smith can typically scheme up a capable run game no matter who is in the backfield. Perhaps he and the Steelers are missing the between-the-tackles consistency Najee Harris provided them the prior four seasons when he went for over 1,000 yards each year from 2021 to 2024. Hall could complement the speedier Jaylen Warren to beef up the Pittsburgh rushing attack. Plus, the Steelers also have an extra third-round pick for 2026 thanks to trading wide receiver George Pickens to the Dallas Cowboys in the offseason. Not necessarily saying a third-round pick is the right price for a rental running back, but the Jets would likely be interested in that offer. The Arizona Cardinals are off to a tough 2-4 start to the 2025 season, but their record is somewhat deceiving. All six of their games have been decided by seven points or fewer this season: they won their first two and are currently on a four-game losing streak. Pro Bowl starting running back James Conner suffered a season-ending ankle injury and 2024 third-round pick Trey Benson is now on injured reserve with a knee injury. The Cardinals don't have much time to right the ship. If they want to get their run game back on track and potentially give Hall an extended tryout to be a part of their future plans, the trade makes sense given he is only 24 years old. The Houston Texans are 2-3 this season, but it's not their defense's fault. Coach DeMeco Ryans ' unit is the NFL's No. 1 scoring defense, allowing just 12.2 points per game. That's the fewest points per game allowed by a team with a losing record through five games in the Super Bowl era (since 1966), per CBS Sports Research. On the other hand, Houston's offense is averaging just 21.6 points per game, 22nd in the league this season. They've been league average on the ground, averaging 116.2 rushing yards per game this year. Their offense sorely lacks juice with just 31 explosive plays this season, tied for the fifth-fewest in the NFL, per TruMedia. The Texans' nine explosive runs are tied for the seventh-fewest in the league in 2025. Quarterback C.J. Stroud is still on his rookie deal, and with Joe Mixon out and Nick Chubb not looking the same after multiple, serious knee injuries throughout his career, Houston should pursue Hall in an attempt to salvage its season.",https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/breece-hall-landing-spots-where-talented-jets-rb-could-be-dealt-before-nfl-trade-deadline,Sport,cbssports.com,,https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2025/10/03/8ce2607b-8c04-437a-b735-04e1d73ef3ea/thumbnail/1200x675/63063490e2f4cc1d4152c345a551a13e/breece-hall-jets-cbs.jpg,2025-10-15T20:04:52+00:00,56f4ff15505c4993ea0de9f718806b0c562f1ab9
f917b2e2eedf,USWNT development: USA soccer's Emma Hayes sees U-23s as crucial piece and Jaedyn Shaw is a glowing example,,"The U.S. women's national team will finally take the pitch after a long summer. The program had no matches with global tournaments across Europe, Africa, and South America this year, and head coach Emma Hayes has named a 26-player roster for the upcoming October friendlies . The Stars and Stripes will play three games during the international window, beginning with two games against Portugal before closing out against New Zealand. Hayes spoke with the media about her roster selections and vision for the senior team as the group looks ahead to FIFA World Cup qualifiers on the horizon. Qualifiers closer than you think The Concacaf W Championship, set for Nov. 2026, is the official World Cup qualifying competition for the region. The USWNT, alongside Canada, is the top-ranked nation in Concacaf, and they will await the six winners from the Concacaf W Qualifiers, which begin next month. ""This is really the build towards qualification for next year. That's what the start of this cycle actually means. And that's not to say that this is the pool of players, solely. You know, It was difficult to make roster selections for this camp,"" Hayes told the media on Wednesday. 'We felt that by taking 26 players, one, I want to honor the place where NWSL is with playoffs and want to maximize. We take 26 so that I can play players, and also send them back to their clubs in a really good condition. But I think this was the one camp I had to make some really, really hard decisions, and that's the place that I wanted to be in, but it's the build for qualification for next year."" U-23 program an extension of the senior team The USWNT manager was clear that three months away from competition isn't ideal, but time away is necessary sometimes and there's fresh energy about a reunion between staff and players. There's also continuing the work around ""futures camps,"" with the U-23 team that was relaunched earlier this year. ""Three months feels like a long time, that's, you know, we're really excited to get back in with the players. Second of all, we've always looked at the futures, initially in the under-23 as an extension of a larger playing pool,"" said Hayes. ""I won't bore you with it now, but we know that we have to provide so many more development opportunities for younger players, and that's why there'll be a flip-flopping between [USWNT] and under 23s."" The U-23 roster will be announced on Thursday, and the training camp will run concurrently with the senior team while they're in camps preparing for friendlies in Philadelphia and Connecticut. Hayes and the staff are also integrating the U-20s team, with a camp that will join the senior team in Kansas City for the final match against New Zealand. Jaedyn Shaw example of youth and senior collaboration Midfielder Jaedyn Shaw is back in the mix with the senior team after for the first time since February. The 20-year-old was recently traded to Gotham FC and has been more productive in the attack since the move. She's split time with senior camps and U-23 teams throughout 2025. ""I think Jayden Shaw, even Jordan Bugg, maybe Lily Reale, are good examples of like the integration between under-23s and seniors,"" said Hayes. ""Do I think that Jaden Shaw will stay solely playing for the seniors from here all the way? No, I don't. I think there is a possibility, especially next camp, we may make the decision as a collective to give her games against top European teams. But what I feel is that Jaedyn has taken on board everything that we've been asking of her ... I think she's really starting to put all of those things together. She's an incredible goal threat in so many ways. And I think this is an opportunity for us to see from the last time, to now, how much of that gap she has closed.""",https://www.cbssports.com/soccer/news/uswnt-development-usa-soccers-emma-hayes-sees-u-23s-as-crucial-piece-and-jaedyn-shaw-is-a-glowing-example,Sport,cbssports.com,,https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2025/10/15/e91461de-75b7-478b-af90-84b4d4872eb8/thumbnail/1200x675/e25b5dec5b1e2351c15e258c3f968d16/shaw.jpg,2025-10-15T19:34:00+00:00,e8d477171358577b51e5563214f46f55e1ef98b0

The guest list included Chris Martin , Alejandro Iñárritu , LL Cool J , “The Pitt” star Supriya Ganesh , Helen Hunt , Beck and Drew Scott of the “Property Brothers.” The evening marked the beginning of Dudamel’s final chapter as the music and artistic director of the LA Phil before he officially takes the helm of the New York Philharmonic in September 2026. “I’m so grateful,” Dudamel said at the start of the concert, adding, “I had only one dream when I was a child, to play with my friends. I didn’t have any ambition. I didn’t have any ambition to go out of Barquisimeto [in Venezuela], my hometown, and conduct…My dream was to get out of the school, El Sistima, and play with my friends and have fun.” That desire to have fun extends to today, he said: “That is my motto.” Dudamel reflected on his years with the LA Phil, joking about times he may have let anger get the best of him. “I can get a little angry [at times] but it always gets to the funny place,” he said, turning to the orchestra. “We always finish with a smile. We look at each other with respect.” One of Dudamel’s signature accomplishments is YOLA (Youth Orchestra Los Angeles), which he launched in 2007 and now provides free instruments and music education to 1,700 young people. Several of the current students, wearing black shirts with “Gracias Gustavo” emblazoned on the back, joined the orchestra on Wednesday night for a performance of the finale of Dvořák’s Symphony No. 9 “From the New World.” “What I found here was generosity to open space to others to make their dreams come true,” Dudamel said. The evening’s concert ended with three encores before guests headed to dinner followed by a dance party, where Dudamel’s father, trombonist Oscar Dudamel, was joined on stage by his son playing the violin. A video tribute played before the concert highlighted Dudamel’s career, including performing at Coachella, multiple Grammy wins and having a playful lightsaber battle with “Star Wars” composer John Williams at the Hollywood Bowl. “The bond [Dudamel] has built here with us is indelible,” the narrator says, in part. “It is family. It is forever.” See more photos from the gala below. Oscar Dudamel, Gustavo Dudamel at the LA Phil Opening Night Gala held at Walt Disney Concert Hall on October 14, 2025 in Los Angeles, California.

c15a1de02f73,‘Splinter Cell: Deathwatch’ Renewed for Season 2 at Netflix,,"“ Splinter Cell: Deathwatch ” has officially been renewed for a second season at Netflix . The news comes one day after the series premiere on Oct. 14. Variety first reported that a “Splinter Cell” animated series was in the works back in 2020, at which time it was reported that Netflix had given the show a two-season order. Based on the “Tom Clancy’s Splinter Cell” video game franchise, the animated series stars Liev Schreiber as Sam Fisher, with Kirby Howell-Baptiste as Zinnia Mckenna. Additional voice cast members include Janet Varney, Helen Hong, Kari Wahlgren, Joel Oulette, Aleks Le, Kiff VandenHeuvel, Bella Dayne, and Navid Negahban. The official logline for the series states, “Legendary agent Sam Fisher is drawn back into the field when a wounded young operative seeks out his help.” Derek Kolstad, best known for his work on the “John Wick” franchise, developed the series for television and serves as executive producer. Guillaume Dousse directs with Félicien Colmet-Daage as co-director. Helene Juguet, Hugo Revon and Gerard Guillemot executive produce for Ubisoft Film & Television. Sun Creature and Fost provides the animation. The first “Splinter Cell” game was released in 2002 to near universal acclaim from critics and massive sales. The game follows former U.S. Navy SEAL Fisher after he is recruited by the NSA to work for the mysterious Third Echelon division within the agency. The game sees Fisher engage in a number of black ops missions, employing stealth and military tactics. The game has spawned six sequels as well as a series of novels.",https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/splinter-cell-deathwatch-renewed-season-2-netflix-1236553948,Entertainment,variety.com,Joe Otterson,https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Splinter_Cell__Deathwatch_u_S1_E2_00_15_04_03_R.png?w=1000&h=563&crop=1,2025-10-15T20:06:36+00:00,6181acba31cded76c64b531e522d65cb313cd48a
3c0a87645ca2,OpenAI’s Plans to Roll Out AI ‘Erotica’ for ChatGPT Slammed by Anti-Porn Group,,"Artificial-intelligence tech giant OpenAI has announced plans to introduce sexually explicit material for its ChatGPT AI-based chatbot later this year — a move that a conservative advocacy group says risks introducing “real mental health harms from synthetic intimacy” without appropriate safeguards. The National Center on Sexual Exploitation issued a statement calling on OpenAI to reverse its plan to allow “erotica” on ChatGPT. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said in a post on X Tuesday that in December, “as we roll out age-gating more fully and as part of our ‘treat adult users like adults’ principle, we will allow even more [kinds of content], like erotica for verified adults” on ChatGPT. According to Altman, the company originally made ChatGPT “pretty restrictive to make sure we were being careful with mental health issues. We realize this made it less useful/enjoyable to many users who had no mental health problems, but given the seriousness of the issue we wanted to get this right.” Altman continued, “Now that we have been able to mitigate the serious mental health issues and have new tools, we are going to be able to safely relax the restrictions in most cases.” The change will mean that ChatGPT will be able “to respond in a very human-like way, or use a ton of emoji, or act like a friend” — or, evidently, talk dirty to you. NCOSE, formerly known as Morality in Media, argues that OpenAI is adding sexual content to the AI chatbot “without credible safeguards.” “Sexualized AI chatbots are inherently risky, generating real mental health harms from synthetic intimacy; all in the context of poorly defined industry safety standards,” said Haley McNamara, executive director and chief strategy Officer at the National Center on Sexual Exploitation. “While [OpenAI’s] age verification is a good step to try preventing childhood exposure to explicit content, the reality is these tools have documented harms to adults as well. We’ve already seen other chatbots emboldened to engage in sexual conversation simulate themes of child abuse or push sexually violent written content on users who asked them to stop.” McNamara concluded, “If OpenAI truly cares about user well-being, it should pause any plans to integrate this so-called ‘erotica’ into ChatGPT and focus on building something positive for humanity.” Reps for OpenAI did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Washington, D.C.-based NCOSE calls itself “the leading national non-profit organization exposing the links between all forms of sexual exploitation such as child sexual abuse, prostitution, sex trafficking and the public health harms of pornography.” Separately, OpenAI has come under fire from the entertainment industry for its Sora 2 video-generation system, which is able to produce recognizable movie and TV characters. Amid the backlash, the Motion Picture Association called on OpenAI to take “immediate action” to fix its copyright opt-out system to shoulder the burden of policing copyright infringement.",https://variety.com/2025/digital/news/openai-erotica-chatgpt-anti-porn-group-ncose-1236553925,Entertainment,variety.com,Todd Spangler,https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/OpenAI-Logo.png?w=1000&h=563&crop=1,2025-10-15T20:03:41+00:00,a4ddc71465dbc2c4e78a780d8b06af5c36fdc192

The image was taken by Zhang You of Yunnan, China. Another of You's photographs placed 15th in this year's contest. “It pays to dive deep into entomology: understanding insects’ behaviors and mastering lighting,"" You said in a statement. ""A standout work blends artistry with scientific rigor, capturing the very essence, energy, and spirit of these creatures.” There was an element of luck in creating his winning image, too. ""I had observed rice weevils in grains before, but never one with its wings spread,"" You said. ""This one was naturally preserved on a windowsill, perhaps in a final attempt to escape. Its tiny size makes manually preparing spread-wing specimens extremely difficult, so encountering it was both serendipitous and inspiring.” Nikon's annual contest was founded in 1974 ""to showcase the beauty and complexity of things seen through the light microscope."" Photomicrography involves attaching a camera to a microscope (either an optical microscope or an electron microscope) so that the user can take photographs of objects at very high resolutions. British physiologist Richard Hill Norris was one of the first to use it for his studies of blood cells in 1850, and the method has increasingly been highlighted as art since the 1970s. There have been many groundbreaking technological advances in the ensuing decades, particularly with the advent of digital imaging methods.",https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/10/meet-the-2025-nikon-photomicrography-winners,Innovation,arstechnica.com,,https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/nikon1-1152x648-1760544093.jpg,2025-10-15T20:30:43+00:00,500f9c4917900e264f912a248fd88129437c3ec9

Artemis V : Will reuse approximately 250 components, primarily life support and avionics equipment, from Artemis II. Artemis VI : Will reuse primary structure (pressure vessel) and secondary structures (gussets, panels, brackets, plates) from Artemis III Orion, and approximately 3,000 components. Lockheed plans to build a fleet of three largely reusable spacecraft, which will make their debuts on the Artemis III, IV, and V missions respectively. Those three vehicles would then fly future missions, and if Lockheed needs to expand the fleet to meet demand, it could. This photo, from 2023, shows the Orions for Artemis II, III, and IV all together. Credit:

          Lockheed Martin Orion, of course, can never be made fully reusable. The service module, built by Europe-based Airbus and providing propulsion, separates from Orion before reentry into Earth's atmosphere and burns up. ""We probably should call it maximum reuse, because there are some things that are consumed,"" Shireman said. ""For instance, the heat shield is consumed as the ablative material is ablated. But we are, ultimately, going to reuse the structure of the heat shield itself."" Vectoring along a new path Orion is always going to be relatively expensive. However, officials said they are on track to trim the cost of producing an Orion by 50 percent from the Artemis II to Artemis V vehicles and in follow-on missions to bring this down by 30 percent further, or more. Minimizing refurbishment will be key to this. Lockheed will never achieve ""full and rapid reusability"" for Orion like SpaceX is attempting with its Starship vehicle. That's just not the way Orion was designed, nor what NASA wants. The space agency seeks a safe and reliable ride into deep space for its astronauts. For the time being, only Orion can provide that. In the future, Starship may well provide that capability. Blue Origin and other providers may develop a deep space-capable human vehicle. But Orion is here and ready for its first astronauts in 2026. It will be years before any alternative comes available. It is nice to see that Lockheed recognizes this advantage won't last forever and that it's moving—or should we say, Vectoring —toward a more sustainable future.",https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/10/once-unthinkable-nasa-and-lockheed-now-consider-launching-orion-on-other-rockets,Innovation,arstechnica.com,,https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/jsc2025e016293large-1152x648.jpg,2025-10-15T20:22:24+00:00,a911666e488afc8fc198e8cd0e77461a810dd36a

Given BIG-IP's network position and its role in managing traffic for web servers, previous compromises have allowed adversaries to expand their access to other parts of an infected network. F5 said that investigations by two outside intrusion-response firms have yet to find any evidence of supply-chain attacks. The company attached letters from firms IOActive and NCC Group attesting that analyses of source code and build pipeline uncovered no signs that a “threat actor modified or introduced any vulnerabilities into the in-scope items."" The firms also said they didn’t identify any evidence of critical vulnerabilities in the system. Investigators, which also included Mandiant and CrowdStrike, found no evidence that data from its CRM, financial, support case management, or health systems was accessed. The company released updates for its BIG-IP, F5OS, BIG-IQ, and APM products. CVE designations and other details are here . Two days ago, F5 rotated BIG-IP signing certificates, though there was no immediate confirmation that the move is in response to the breach. The US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security agency has warned that federal agencies that rely on the appliance face an “imminent threat” from the thefts, which “pose an unacceptable risk.” The agency went on to direct federal agencies under its control to take “emergency action.” The UK’s National Cyber Security Center issued a similar directive. CISA has ordered all federal agencies it oversees to immediately take inventory of all BIG-IP devices in networks they run or in networks that outside providers run on their behalf. The agency went on to direct agencies to install the updates and follow a threat-hunting guide that F5 has also issued.

Published On 15 Oct 2025 15 Oct 2025 Click here to share on social media share2 Share Germany has pledged more than $2bn in military aid for Ukraine, as the government in Kyiv signalled that it would need $120bn in 2026 to stave off Russia’s nearly four-year all-out war. Speaking on Wednesday at a Ukraine Defence Contact Group meeting in Brussels, German Foreign Minister Boris Pistorius said that Western allies must maintain their resolve and provide more weapons to Ukraine. Recommended Stories list of 3 items end of list “You can count on Germany. We will continue and expand our support for Ukraine. With new contracts, Germany will provide additional support amounting to over 2 billion euros [$2.3bn],” Pistorius told the meeting in Brussels, which was also attended by US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and Ukrainian Defence Minister Denys Shmyhal. “The package addresses a number of urgent requirements of Ukraine. It provides air defence systems, Patriot interceptors, radar systems and precision guided artillery, rockets and ammunition,” Pistorius said, adding that Germany will also deliver two additional IRIS-T air defence systems to Ukraine, including a large number of guided missiles and shoulder-fired air defence missiles. In recent months, the transatlantic alliance started to coordinate regular deliveries of large weapons packages to Ukraine to help fend off Russia’s war. Spare weapons stocks in European arsenals have all but dried up, and only the United States has a sufficient store of ready weapons that Ukraine most needs. Under the financial arrangement – known as the Prioritised Ukraine Requirements List (PURL) – European allies and Canada are buying US weapons to help Kyiv keep Russian forces at bay. About $2bn worth had previously been allocated since August. Germany’s pledge came as Ukraine’s Western backers gathered to drum up more military support for their beleaguered partner. Shmyhal put his country’s defence needs next year at $120bn. “Ukraine will cover half, $60bn, from our national resources. We are asking partners to join us in covering the other half,” he said. Air defence systems are most in need. Shmyhal said that last month alone, Russia “launched over 5,600 strike drones and more than 180 missiles targeting our civilian infrastructure and people”. The new pledges of support came a day after new data showed that foreign military aid to Ukraine had declined sharply recently. Despite the PURL programme, support plunged by 43 percent in July and August compared to the first half of the year, according to Germany’s Kiel Institute, which tracks such deliveries and funding. Hegseth said that “all countries need to translate goals into guns, commitments into capabilities and pledges into power. That’s all that matters. Hard power. It’s the only thing belligerents actually respect.” The administration of US President Donald Trump hasn’t donated military equipment to Ukraine. It has been weighing whether to send Tomahawk long-range missiles if Russia doesn’t wind down its war soon, but it remains unclear who will pay for those weapons, should they be approved.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/15/germany-pledges-2bn-in-military-aid-for-ukraine-as-kyiv-seeks-more-funds,World,aljazeera.com,,https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/afp_68efed92afd3-1760554386.jpg?resize=1920%2C1440,,77c5d84c2db47fcbec7578c19f080aa3ac82d2de

The Eagles struggled mightily on defense last week, and it's uncertain if cornerback Quinyon Mitchell (hamstring) will be back this week. ""I think it's fair to call this game a must win for Philadelphia coming off two straight losses.

Coming off a bye week and with a brutal stretch ahead, this game might be a must win for Minnesota as well.

Pittsburgh (4-1) has won three straight, including a 23-9 victory over Cleveland on Sunday, and the Steelers are 2-0 on the road this season. Cincinnati (2-4) has lost four in a row since losing Joe Burrow to injury, and the Bengals suffered a 27-18 loss to Green Bay in Week 6. These teams split their two matchups last season, with the road team winning each game. Cincinnati tight end Mike Gesicki (pectoral) and defensive end Trey Hendrickson (hip) were among the players who did not practice Tuesday. Kickoff is at 8:15 p.m. ET from Paycor Stadium in Cincinnati, and Pittsburgh has won each of its last three trips to Cincy.

Aaron Rodgers ' 105.4 passer rating is the sixth-highest of his career, and of the five years in which he had a better rating, he won NFL MVP in four of them. Rodgers also has the third-highest completion percentage and touchdown rate of his career, while his pairing with DK Metcalf has hit its stride. The former Seahawk has touchdown receptions in four straight games, as he's just one touchdown catch away from matching his total from last season (five). The Steelers' +7 turnover differential is the second-best in the league, and even if they don't notch a takeaway, the defense can still produce elite performances. That's what occurred on Sunday as Pittsburgh's nine points allowed to Cleveland were the fewest the Steelers have given up all year. Another dominant defensive effort can be expected on Thursday versus a Cincinnati team which ranks in the bottom four in the key stats of points scored, yards gained, rushing offense and passing offense. See which team to back at SportsLine . Why the Bengals can cover Cincinnati is coming off a road loss to Green Bay, but there were some promising signs for the Bengals. One is that the team covered, after losing three straight ATS, and another was the performance of Joe Flacco , just days after being acquired by the team. Flacco provided a spark for the offense as he had two touchdown passes and no turnovers, compared to Jake Browning , who failed to have more touchdowns than turnovers in any of his four games. Ja'Marr Chase had a 10-94-1 stat line as his 12th career game with 10-plus catches and a touchdown are now tied for fourth-most in NFL history. Cincy is a perfect 4 for 4 in red-zone scoring over their last two games, and it ranks second in the NFL in red-zone conversion percentage this season. That could be a bad omen for Pittsburgh, as its defense isn't quite on par with prior seasons. The Steelers are 26th in total defense, 27th in passing defense and haven't experienced much recent success in flustering Flacco. The 40-year-old has played turnover-free ball versus the Steelers over his last three games versus them. See which team to back at SportsLine .

Couple that with a number of upsets, including the Thursday night New York Giants win over the Philadelphia Eagles 34-17, and many survivor pool players' hopes are in tatters. For those still alive, this week's schedule does give them a number of options to be able to move on. Among the likely targets for NFL survivor players this week include Packers vs. Cardinals (+6.5), Buccaneers vs. Lions (-5.5) on 'Monday Night Football,' Patriots (-7) vs. Titans and Broncos (-7) vs. Giants. Meanwhile, the Kansas City Chiefs will look to battle their way back to the top of the AFC West standings when they take on the visiting Las Vegas Raiders. Las Vegas is 2-4 on the year and fourth in the AFC West, while the Chiefs are third at 3-3. Kansas City enters as an 11.5-point favorite, the largest line of the week, so the Chiefs will be an appealing option for those who can still use them.

With a huge rivalry win against Florida State in the rear view, Mario Cristobal's squad is now focused on finishing strong and securing a spot in the ACC Championship Game, which is the first step to winning the first ACC title in program history. Louisville also had last week off but entered its break on a far different note, falling in overtime at home to Virginia back in Week 6. The Cardinals got 329 yards passing and three total touchdowns (two passing, one rushing) from quarterback Miller Moss in the effort, but lost the turnover battle and gave up a walk-off touchdown on the second possession of overtime. At 4-1 overall, Louisville can still accomplish its goals of similarly competing for an ACC title, but that likely requires taking down the top-5 Canes in their own house on Friday night. Miami leads the all-time series with a 12-4-1 record, though Mario Cristobal and Jeff Brohm have split their meetings since taking over as head coaches at their respective alma maters. Louisville won 38-31 in 2023 en route to locking up a spot in the ACC title game, then last season Miami got revenge with a 52-45 win in Louisville last year. Miami vs. Louisville: Need to know Carson Beck's resurgence drives the Miami offense: Trying to fill the shoes for Cam Ward was going to be no easy task, but Carson Beck has found similar success without trying to replicate Ward's game. Beck ranks in the top five nationally in completion percentage and has done a great job of staying patient behind one of the best offensive lines in the country to dissect opposing defenses. The Hurricanes aren't putting up the same eye-popping offensive numbers as they did in 2024, but when Beck needs to take over he has shown he is capable of doing so like his 4 touchdown, no interception performance in the win against Florida State. Miami defense boasting one of the best DE tandems in the country: The combination of Akheem Mesidor and Rueben Bain Jr . have taken Miami's defense to a terrifying new level in 2025. The group needed a reset as new defensive coordinator Corey Heatherman took over a unit that was falling short of expectations, and with a new scheme and some healthier weapons the defense has become an absolute strength this season. Mesidor and Bain are among the best in the country when it comes to pressuring the quarterback, and their unique advantages change the way offenses have to adjust their play-calling particularly in key downs. Miami ranks second in the ACC and 14th nationally in third down defense, with that pass rush playing a key part. Chris Bell stepping up in ACC play for Louisville: Louisville wide receiver Chris Bell has been one of the best pass catchers in ACC play, totaling 22 receptions for 305 yards and three touchdowns over the last two games. Bell was a machine in the loss to Virginia, racking up 12 receptions for a career-high 170 yards and two scores, becoming the first Louisville player since 2020 to have 170+ receiving yards in a game. Quarterback Miller Moss has been tasked with shouldering more of the offensive load as the Cardinals have dealt with some nagging and minor injuries in the running back room, and he's responded by elevating his production with the help of Bell's outstanding work at wide receiver.

Miami vs. Louisville prediction, picks Miami has a major matchup advantage here when Louisville tries to block one of the best defensive fronts in the country. The Hurricanes don't do anything too exotic, they just have elite players who pin their ears back, win battles in the trenches and get after the quarterback. That's going to make for a long evening for Miller Moss so even if Miami's offense is a little slow out of the gates over the course of the game the Hurricanes should be able to cover the two-touchdown spread.

faa60f993370,Draymond Green doesn't think he could average 20 points on a lottery team,,"Draymond Green begins his 14th NBA season when the Warriors take on the Lakers Oct. 22 on opening night. He is a four-time champion, Defensive Player of the Year winner, four-time All Star and two-time All-NBA player. He will retire as a first-ballot Hall of Famer easily, and despite the ever evolving roster around him, Green will almost certainly retire with the Warriors. But Green's also at the point in his career where we see some decline in players, which often leads to the team making a tough decision in moving on from them in favor of a younger -- or in Klay Thompson's case, a cheaper -- option. However, Green doesn't appear to be itching to leave Golden State, and even if he did it certainly wouldn't be for a rebuilding team. ""Could I average 20 [points] on a lottery team? I have no interest in doing that,"" Green said on the ""Why is Draymond Green Talking About Football?""  podcast when asked how much he could average on a lottery team. ""You want me to go play bad basketball? ... I once averaged 15 [points] on a great team. So, you do the math."" Green is probably the worst person to ask that question to, because he's never been the type of player to chase stats. The reason he's considered an all-time great is because he carved out a role for himself with the Warriors which consists of a lot of intangible things that don't show up on the box score. He's going to be the defensive anchor, capable of sliding between multiple positions, can be the connector offensively as a facilitator and is the heart of the Warriors dynasty with his fiery personality which has its pros and cons. That lone season Green averaged 15 points (actually was 14 points but that's a minor discrepancy) is the year that the Warriors set the record for most regular season wins with 73. That team clicked on all cylinders in more ways than one, and could be considered the peak of Golden State's powers despite losing in the Finals to LeBron James and the Cavaliers . Since that year, Green's role has been less of a scorer and more as a Swiss army knife doing whatever is necessary. ""I don't know if I have that mindset anymore,"" Green said. ""That's a mindset that you have to have, and I left that mindset so long ago that I'm not sure I could even tap back into that. ... The reason I got to the NBA is because I could score. To then come into the NBA and be doing that, and then like have to switch the whole thing up, it's hard to just go back to that. It requires you to change how you see the game. There's a certain way that I had to start seeing the game for our teams to work. So to then try to flip back to that, it's a very tough thing to do."" Luckily, Green probably doesn't have to concern himself with those hypotheticals, because it would be incredibly shocking if he didn't retire with the Warriors. Or at the very least if he were to leave, he'd certainly join another championship-contending team.",https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/draymond-green-doesnt-think-he-could-average-20-points-on-a-lottery-team,Sport,cbssports.com,,https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2025/10/15/59df3237-d2a8-4690-ae47-55e12592d960/thumbnail/1200x675/70ceb412fd49b4e08ac894e28a00606e/draymond-green-warriors.jpg,2025-10-15T20:39:43+00:00,929e7fe3aae6fa9c6f62c72a5b1533acf5b3c10e

As injuries around the league have started to take their toll, the parity among the 32 teams has never been greater. There are plenty of teams in contention through six weeks and Super Bowl aspirations are starting to become real for a good chuck of the surprising teams. As for injuries, there are quite a few to monitor this week. Will Los Angeles Rams wide receiver Puka Nacua play on Sunday? Is San Francisco 49ers tight end George Kittle returning? Will New York Jets wide receiver Garrett Wilson practice this week? How about Arizona Cardinals quarterback Kyler Murray and wide receiver Marvin Harrison Jr. ? We'll keep an eye on the key injuries from all the Wednesday practices in this injury rundown. The Steelers might not have Elliott on a short week, as he did not travel with the team to Cincinnati this week -- but still listed him as questionable (so there's a chance he'll play). Jalen Ramsey , who fought through a hamstring injury to play last week, was not given an injury designation this week. The Bengals may go into Thursday's game without Hendrickson, but listed him as questionable after he didn't practice at all on a short week. Cincinnati placed Gesicki on injured reserve and Hudson didn't clear protocol, so Drew Sample is the TE1.

71b6ec89ef8f,"Michael J. Fox Met With Eric Stoltz for the First Time, 40 Years After ‘Back to the Future’ Recasting: We Discovered It ‘Had Not Made Us Enemies or Rivals’",,"Michael J. Fox reveals in his new memoir, “Future Boy,” that he wrote a letter to Eric Stoltz asking to finally meet 40 years after Fox replaced Stoltz as Marty McFly in the blockbuster “ Back to the Future .” As the infamous story goes, Stoltz was already in production for six weeks on the Robert Zemeckis-directed blockbuster when the decision was made to boot him and recast the lead role with the director’s first choice, Fox, who had been blocked from the film due to his commitment to the NBC sitcom “Family Ties.” “Eric has maintained his silence on the subject for 40 years, so I was prepared for the likelihood that he’d prefer to keep it that way,” Fox writes in the memoir (via Entertainment Weekly ), noting the two had never come face to face to discuss the casting swap. Fox wrote to him: “If your answer is ‘piss off and leave me alone’… That works, too.” Stoltz responded with a “beautifully written reply” that “began, ‘Piss off and leave me alone!’ Thankfully, this was followed by ‘I jest…’ Eric was thoughtful about my outreach, and although he respectfully declined to participate in the book, he seemed open to the idea of getting together.” When Fox and Stoltz finally found themselves together in the same room, the actors “immediately fell into an easy dialogue about our careers, families, and yes, our own trips through the space-time continuum,” Fox writes. “[Stoltz entered] with a smile, and we quickly acknowledged that neither of us had an issue with the other. What transpired on ‘Back to the Future’ had not made us enemies or fated rivals; we were just two dedicated actors who had poured equal amounts of energy into the same role. The rest had nothing to do with us. As it turned out, we had much more in common than our spin as Marty.” “In the months since meeting, Eric and I have maintained a friendly correspondence – volleys back and forth between like-minded actors and dads, offering up recent movies we’ve loved, the latest adventures with our kids and an occasional detour into politics,” Fox adds. “His emails are reliably witty and always fun to read [and] a reminder that some of the best parts of our future can come from the past.” Replacing Stoltz as Marty McFly in “Back to the Future” changed the course of Fox’s career, as he made the jump from sitcom star to blockbuster actor. The movie grossed $381.1 million worldwide in 1985 to become the year’s highest-grossing movie and spawned a franchise that led to 1989’s “Back to the Future Part II” and 1990’s “Back to the Future Part III,” both of which Fox headlined. In his memoir, Fox writes that “Family Ties” creator Gary David Goldberg “removed me from consideration” to play Marty McFly when Zemeckis and producer Steven Spielberg wanted to originally cast him. The film “had already shot for over a month” and the dailies with Stoltz front and center “were disappointing” to the creative team. “Eric was an immensely talented actor, but the creative team felt that he just wasn’t the right fit for Marty McFly,” Fox notes. Fox’s memoir, “Future Boy,” is now available for purchase.",https://variety.com/2025/film/news/michael-j-fox-met-eric-stoltz-back-to-the-future-recasting-1236553741,Entertainment,variety.com,Zack Sharf,https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/MCDBATO_UV022.jpg?w=1000&h=563&crop=1,2025-10-15T20:42:50+00:00,924483356d1e9263f586816aef4c25533262d4b6
ba831e5fca7b,Army general says he’s using AI to improve “decision-making”,,"Last month, OpenAI published a usage study showing that nearly 15 percent of work-related conversations on ChatGPT had to deal with ""making decisions and solving problems."" Now comes word that at least one high-level member of the US military is using LLMs for the same purpose. At the Association of the US Army Conference in Washington, DC, this week, Maj. Gen. William ""Hank"" Taylor reportedly said that ""Chat and I are really close lately,"" using a distressingly familiar diminutive nickname to refer to an unspecified AI chatbot. ""AI is one thing that, as a commander, it’s been very, very interesting for me."" Military-focused news site DefenseScoop reports that Taylor told a roundtable group of reporters that he and the Eighth Army he commands out of South Korea are ""regularly using"" AI to modernize their predictive analysis for logistical planning and operational purposes. That is helpful for paperwork tasks like ""just being able to write our weekly reports and things,"" Taylor said, but it also aids in informing their overall direction. “One of the things that recently I’ve been personally working on with my soldiers is decision-making—individual decision-making,"" Taylor said. ""And how [we make decisions] in our own individual life, when we make decisions, it’s important. So, that’s something I’ve been asking and trying to build models to help all of us. Especially, [on] how do I make decisions, personal decisions, right — that affect not only me, but my organization and overall readiness?"" That's still a far cry from the Terminator vision of autonomous AI weapon systems that take lethal decisions out of human hands. Still, using LLMs for military decision-making might give pause to anyone familiar with the models' well-known propensity to confabulate fake citations and sycophantically flatter users .",https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/10/army-general-says-hes-using-ai-to-improve-decision-making,Innovation,arstechnica.com,,https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/GettyImages-2219849110-1152x648.jpg,2025-10-15T21:31:00+00:00,5dd77415cd560e4f6fcb75cd8194d584c69fb534

Published On 15 Oct 2025 15 Oct 2025 Click here to share on social media share2 Share United States President Donald Trump says that Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has pledged to stop buying oil from Russia, and Trump said he would next try to get China to do the same as Washington intensifies efforts to cut off Moscow’s energy revenues. India and China are the two top buyers of Russian seaborne crude exports, taking advantage of the discounted prices Russia has been forced to accept after European buyers shunned purchases and the US and the European Union imposed sanctions on Moscow for its invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. Recommended Stories list of 3 items end of list Trump has recently targeted India for its Russian oil purchases, imposing tariffs on Indian exports to the US to discourage the country’s crude buying as he seeks to choke off Russia’s oil revenues and pressure Moscow to negotiate a peace deal with Ukraine. “So I was not happy that India was buying oil, and he assured me today that they will not be buying oil from Russia,” Trump told reporters during a White House event. “That’s a big step. Now we’re going to get China to do the same thing.” The Indian embassy in Washington did not immediately respond to emailed questions about whether Modi had made such a commitment to Trump. Russia is India’s top oil supplier. Moscow exported 1.62 million barrels per day to India in September, roughly one-third of the country’s oil imports. For months, Modi resisted US pressure, with Indian officials defending the purchases as vital to national energy security. A move by India to stop imports would signal a major shift by one of Moscow’s top energy customers and could reshape the calculus for other nations still importing Russian crude. Trump wants to leverage bilateral relationships to enforce economic isolation on Russia, rather than relying solely on multilateral sanctions. During his comments to reporters, Trump added that India could not “immediately” halt shipments, calling it “a little bit of a process, but that process will be over soon”. Despite his push on India, Trump has largely avoided placing similar pressure on China. The US trade war with Beijing has complicated diplomatic efforts, with Trump reluctant to risk further escalation by demanding a halt to Chinese energy imports from Russia.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/15/trump-says-modi-has-assured-him-india-will-not-buy-russian-oil,World,aljazeera.com,,https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/AP25287682861481-1760473075.jpg?resize=1920%2C1440,,688cfe51b6daab062f3b90768330a7548fe0dbf2

Bank of America, the second-largest bank in the United States, declined to comment on the allegations. BNY did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Recommended Stories list of 3 items end of list The woman, referred to in court papers on Wednesday as Jane Doe, is seeking an unspecified amount of damages from both banks. She is represented by law firms Boies Schiller and Edwards Henderson, who previously secured settlements of $75m and $290m with Deutsche Bank and JPMorgan, respectively, over their alleged financial ties to Epstein. Neither Deutsche Bank nor JPMorgan admitted wrongdoing in agreeing to settle. Congress probes Epstein case Epstein died by suicide in 2019 in jail while awaiting trial on sex-trafficking charges. The circumstances of his death, as well as his social relationships with wealthy and powerful individuals, have fuelled theories that others were involved in his crimes. His case has become a political headache for President Donald Trump’s administration. After pledging during the 2024 campaign to release files from the Department of Justice’s investigation into Epstein, the administration reversed course this year, prompting an outcry from Trump’s conservative base and members of Congress . The House Oversight Committee is now investigating the Epstein case. In both lawsuits, Jane Doe said she met Epstein in 2011 while she was living in Russia. She said she became financially dependent on Epstein, who raped her, forcibly touched her and forced her to engage in sex acts with other women at least 100 times between 2011 and 2019. “As Congress works toward unraveling how Jeffrey Epstein was able to orchestrate his criminal sex trafficking enterprise for decades without detection, we are taking another important step forward toward justice for survivors,” Sigrid McCawley, a lawyer for Jane Doe, said in a statement. Plaintiff says Epstein paid her rent Jane Doe said she opened a Bank of America account in 2013 at the direction of Richard Kahn, Epstein’s former accountant, and that Kahn regularly sent her money for rent through the account. Lawyers for Kahn did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Doe said that, in 2015, Kahn’s assistant told her Epstein was adding her to the payroll for a “sham company” and that she would receive funds through her Bank of America account. She said she did not know the purpose of those payments. Her lawyers wrote that those transactions should have raised red flags for Bank of America. Epstein had pleaded guilty to state-level prostitution charges in Florida in 2008 as part of an arrangement that allowed him to avoid federal prosecution. The lawsuit against BNY said the bank gave a line of credit to MC2, a modelling agency that Epstein and French model scout Jean-Luc Brunel used to traffic victims , according to the lawsuit. In total, BNY processed $378m in payments to women trafficked by Epstein, the lawsuit said. Brunel was arrested in December 2020 and was found dead in jail in 2022, according to Parisian prosecutors. Both lawsuits said the banks should have filed Suspicious Activity Reports with the US Department of the Treasury. The complaints also allege that such reports could have helped law enforcement stop Epstein sooner.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/15/bank-of-america-bank-of-new-york-sued-for-alleged-ties-to-jeffrey-epstein,World,aljazeera.com,,https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2025-10-15T105012Z_1274804158_RC29CHAF0YTM_RTRMADP_3_BANK-OF-AMERICA-RESULTS-1760561828.jpg?resize=1920%2C1440,,62c627772d94d02d28a550ee72375db7a7018dc5

On Wednesday, Minister of Industry Melanie Joly sent a letter to Stellantis CEO Antonio Filosa noting that the company had agreed to maintain its Canadian presence in exchange for substantial financial support. Recommended Stories list of 4 items end of list “Anything short of fulfilling that commitment will be considered a default under our agreement,” she said. If Stellantis did not live up to its commitment, Canada would “exercise all options, including legal”, she said. Stellantis announced a $13bn investment in the US on Tuesday, a move that it said would bring five new models to the market. As part of the plan, production of the Jeep Compass will move to the US state of Illinois from a facility in Brampton in the Canadian province of Ontario. A copy of the letter was made available to the Reuters news agency. The existence of the letter was first reported by Bloomberg. Stellantis had paused retooling of the Brampton plant in February, shortly after US President Donald Trump announced tariffs against Canadian goods, upending the highly integrated North American auto industry. In a statement on Tuesday night, Canada’s Prime Minister Mark Carney said Ottawa had made clear it expected Stellantis to fulfil the undertakings it had made to the workers at the plant. “We are working with the company to develop the right measures to protect Stellantis employees,” he said. Ontario is Canada’s industrial heartland and accounts for about 40 percent of its national gross domestic product (GDP). “I have spoken with Stellantis to stress my disappointment with their decision,” Ontario Premier Doug Ford said on social media on Wednesday. Stellantis spokesperson LouAnn Gosselin said the company was investing in Canada and noted plans to add a third shift to a plant in Windsor, Ontario. “Canada is very important to us.

In November 2024, McBee pleaded guilty in federal court to — according to a Department of Justice press release — a “multi-million dollar fraud scheme involving federal crop insurance benefits he was not entitled to receive” from 2018 through 2020. In other words, he falsified reports for the family’s Gallatin, Mo., farm in order to receive subsidies and insurance payments they weren’t authorized to get. In a memo from Oct. 6, prosecutors asked U.S. District Court Judge Stephen R. Bough to sentence McBee to 41 months in prison, followed by three years of supervised release and more than $4 million in restitution. On the show, the economics of McBee Farming Operations are always presented as precarious. Because of these legal problems, McBee appeared only twice in the show’s second season, after taking center stage in Season 1. According to ratings provided by Bravo, Season 2 of “The McBee Dynasty” — which ran from June 30-Sept. 1 — averaged 1.3 million weekly viewers across platforms. Compared with Season 1, its ratings were up 82% on Peacock and 213% on DVR. The second half of the 10-episode season showed gains of +16% on Peacock and +8% on Bravo through seven-day viewership. In an interesting statistic, about one-third of the second season’s “McBee” audience, Bravo says, “co-viewed with someone else on both Bravo and Peacock, making it a Top 4 Original Series of 2025 on both platforms – fueled by female viewers watching with male viewers.”",https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/mcbee-dynasty-renewed-season-3-bravo-steven-mcbee-sentencing-1236551578,Entertainment,variety.com,Kate Aurthur,https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/NUP_206000_02412.jpg?w=1000&h=563&crop=1,2025-10-15T22:00:00+00:00,468ec74ae54673afea754e6b8b66ce564e8520c2

Randrianirina “will be sworn in as President of the Refoundation of the Republic of Madagascar during a solemn hearing of the High Constitutional Court” on October 17, said the statement, published on social media by a state television station on Thursday. Recommended Stories list of 3 items end of list Rajoelina, who was impeached by lawmakers after fleeing abroad during the weekend, has condemned the takeover and refused to step down despite youth-led demonstrations demanding his resignation and widespread defections in the security forces. Randrianirina led a rebellion that sided with the protesters and ousted Rajoelina on Tuesday in the sprawling country of about 30 million people off of Africa’s east coast. Since gaining independence from France in 1960, the country has had a history of coups and political crises. The latest military takeover capped weeks of protests against Rajoelina and his government, led by youth groups calling themselves “Gen Z Madagascar”. The protesters, who also included labour unions and civic groups, have demanded better government and job opportunities, echoing youth-led protests elsewhere in the world. Among other things, the Madagascar protesters have railed against chronic water and electricity outages, limited access to higher education, government corruption and poverty, which affects roughly three out of every four Madagascans, according to the World Bank. Although some suggest the military seized power on the backs of the civilian protesters, demonstrators cheered Randrianirina and other soldiers from his elite CAPSAT unit as they triumphantly rode through the streets of the capital Antananarivo on Tuesday. The colonel has promised elections in two years. The takeover was “an awakening of the people. It was launched by the youth. And the military supported us”, said the protest leader, Safika, who only gave one name as has been typical with the demonstrators. “We must always be wary, but the current state of affairs gives us reason to be confident,” Safika told The Associated Press news agency. The protests reached a turning point Saturday when Randrianirina and soldiers from his unit sided with the demonstrators calling for the president to resign. Rajoelina said he fled to an undisclosed country because he feared for his life. Randrianirina had long been a vocal critic of Rajoelina’s administration and was reportedly imprisoned for several months in 2023 for plotting a coup. His swift takeover drew international concern. The African Union condemned the coup and announced the country’s suspension from the bloc. The United Nations said they were “deeply concerned by the unconstitutional change of power”.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/15/au-suspends-madagascar-as-military-leader-to-be-sworn-in-as-president,World,aljazeera.com,,https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/ap_68f017b54dd47-1760565173.jpg?resize=1920%2C1440,,300935baaf2deec7dd1cba0fb681ee73c05bf83a

But we’re going to stop them by land also.” Trump’s remarks are likely to further escalate tensions with Venezuela, whose leader, Nicolas Maduro , has long been a target for the US president, stretching back to his first term in office. Already, both leaders have bolstered their military forces along the Caribbean Sea in a show of potential force. But the New York Times’ reporting suggests Trump has gone a step further, greenlighting the presence of US intelligence officials on Venezuelan soil to carry out lethal missions. Citing anonymous administration officials, the Times says the new authorisation is part of a broader strategy to topple Maduro. Reporters sought to confront Trump with that assertion as well. “Does the CIA have authority to take out Maduro?” one journalist asked at the White House on Wednesday. “Oh, I don’t want to answer a question like that. That’s a ridiculous question for me to be given,” Trump said, demurring. “Not really a ridiculous question, but wouldn’t it be a ridiculous question for me to answer?” He then offered an addendum: “But I think Venezuela’s feeling heat.” Claiming wartime powers Trump’s response, at times meandering, touched on his oft-repeated claims about Venezuela, though. Since taking office for a second term, Trump has sought to assume wartime powers — using laws like the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 — by alleging that Venezuela had masterminded an “invasion” of migrants and criminal groups onto US soil. He has offered little proof for his assertions, though, and his statements have been undercut by the assessments of his own intelligence community. In May, for example, a declassified US report revealed that intelligence officials had found no evidence directly linking Maduro to criminal groups like Tren de Aragua, as Trump has alleged. Still, on Wednesday, Trump revisited the baseless claim that Venezuela under Maduro had sent prisoners and people with mental health conditions to destabilise the US. “Many countries have done it, but not like Venezuela.  They were down and dirty,” Trump said. If accurate, the Times report would be the latest indication that Trump has been signing secret proclamations to lay the groundwork for lethal action overseas. In August, for instance, anonymous sources told the US media that Trump had also signed an order allowing the US military to take action against drug-trafficking cartels and other Latin American criminal networks. And in October, it emerged that Trump had sent a memo to the US Congress asserting that the country was in a “non-international armed conflict” with the cartels, whom he termed “unlawful combatants”. Many such groups, including Tren de Aragua, have also been added to the US’s list of “foreign terrorist organisations”, though experts point out that the label alone does not provide a legal basis for military action. Strikes in the Caribbean Sea Nevertheless, the US under Trump has taken a series of escalatory military actions, including by conducting multiple missile strikes on small vessels off the Venezuelan coast. At least five known air strikes have been conducted on boats since September 2, killing 27 people. The most recent attack was announced on Tuesday in a social media post: A video Trump shared showed a boat floating in the water, before a missile set it alight. Six people were reportedly killed in that bombing. Many legal experts and former military officials have said that the strikes appear to be a clear violation of international law. Drug traffickers have not traditionally met the definition of armed combatants in a war. But Trump has justified the strikes by saying they will save American lives lost to drug addiction. He has maintained the people on board the targeted boats were “narco-terrorists” headed to the US, though he has failed to provide evidence for those assertions. On Wednesday, he again brushed aside a question about the lack of evidence. He also defended himself against concerns that the bombings amount to extrajudicial killings. “When they’re loaded up with drugs, they’re fair game,” Trump told reporters, adding there was “fentanyl dust all over the boat after those bombs go off”. He added, “We know we have much information about each boat that goes. Deep, strong information.” Framing the bombing campaign in the Caribbean as a success, Trump then explained his administration might start to pivot its strategy. “ We’ve almost totally stopped it by sea. Now, we’ll stop it by land,” he said of the alleged drug trafficking. He joked that even fishermen had decided to stay off the waters. “ We are certainly looking at land now because we’ve got the sea very well under control.”",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/15/trump-seems-to-confirm-report-that-he-greenlit-cia-operations-in-venezuela,World,aljazeera.com,Brian Osgood,https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/AP25288740495663-1760566840.jpg?resize=1920%2C1440,,82c927b5f0d0b4bfae3eb6d4a13e4aead20f3329

Reunions saw a mix of joy and sadness after people heard about the conditions and mistreatment their loved ones endured. Hundreds more were forced into exile by Israel. And the majority return to rubble in Gaza, and others risk being arrested again in the occupied West Bank. So, is it possible for former Palestinian prisoners to embrace freedom with life under occupation and the scars of Israeli detention?

66ecc0fb1a91,Gaza medics find signs of torture on Palestinian bodies returned by Israel,"news, gaza, israel, middle east, palestine","Gaza’s Ministry of Health says it has received the remains of 45 Palestinians who were held in Israeli custody via the International Committee of the Red Cross, bringing the total number of bodies returned to 90 as part of a United States-brokered ceasefire deal. Medical teams are continuing to examine, document and prepare the bodies for delivery to families “in line with approved medical procedures and protocols”, the Health Ministry said in a statement on Wednesday. Recommended Stories list of 3 items end of list Under a ceasefire deal backed by US President Donald Trump and aimed at ending the two-year Gaza war, Israel was to turn over the bodies of 15 Palestinians for every deceased Israeli returned. The remains of 45 people were returned on Monday. Palestinians awaited information about the bodies that arrived at Nasser Hospital on Tuesday and Wednesday. The forensics team described disturbing conditions, bearing signs of physical abuse. Some of the Palestinian bodies were blindfolded and handcuffed, indicating “field executions” may have taken place, medical sources told Al Jazeera. Israel is expected to hand over more bodies, though officials have not said how many are in its custody or how many will be returned. It remains unclear whether the bodies were dug up from cemeteries by the Israeli army during its ground offensive or if they belong to detainees who were killed during the Israeli assault. Throughout the war, Israel’s military has exhumed bodies as part of its search for the remains of captives. As forensic teams examined the first remains returned, the Health Ministry on Wednesday released images of 32 unidentified bodies to help families recognise missing relatives. Many appeared decomposed or burned. Some were missing limbs or teeth, while others were coated in sand and dust. Health officials have said Israeli restrictions on allowing DNA testing equipment into Gaza have often forced morgues to rely on physical features and clothing for identification. The forensics team that received the bodies said some arrived still shackled or bearing signs of physical abuse. “There are signs of torture and executions ,” Sameh Hamad, a member of a commission tasked with receiving the bodies at Nasser Hospital, said. The bodies belonged to men aged 25 to 70. Most had bands on their necks, including one who had a rope around his neck. Most of the bodies wore civilian clothing, but some were in uniforms, suggesting they were Palestinian fighters. Hamad said the Red Cross provided names for only three of the dead, leaving many families uncertain of their relatives’ fate. Israel’s war on Gaza has killed nearly 68,000 Palestinians since October 2023, according to the Health Ministry. Palestinian officials say the true toll could be far higher, with tens of thousands of bodies believed to be under the rubble. Thousands more people are missing, according to the Red Cross and Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics. Rasmiya Qudeih, 52, waited outside Nasser Hospital, hoping her son would be among the 45 bodies transferred from Israel on Wednesday. He vanished on October 7, 2023, the day of the Hamas-led attack. She was told he was killed by an Israeli strike. “God willing, he will be with the bodies,” she said. The Health Ministry released a video showing medical workers examining the bodies, saying the remains would be returned to families or buried if left unidentified. Rights groups and a United Nations Commission of Inquiry have accused Israel of committing genocide in Gaza, and South Africa has filed a case alleging Israel committed genocide at the International Court of Justice. Israel denies the accusations.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/15/gaza-medics-find-signs-of-torture-on-palestinian-bodies-returned-by-israel,World,aljazeera.com,,https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/epa_68efa4812c80-1760535681.jpg?resize=1920%2C1440,,861ba0e9d2385e30735e9293f8d5a9cb3cde2914

They suffered the most embarrassing loss of any team in the league two weeks ago when they melted down against the then-winless Titans to hand Tennessee a victory. At 2-4 and in danger of falling fully out of the playoff race, they are dealing with another injury absence from quarterback Kyler Murray . Murray missed last week's game with a foot sprain, and his status still unsure for this week against Green Bay. Cardinals coach Jonathan Gannon received a question Wednesday about dealing with injuries and when he learned to put emotion aside as a coach. He offered up an extremely blunt answer about his time on the Atlanta Falcons coaching staff. ""2007. When our quarterback went to jail,"" Gannon said, succinctly. It's highly doubtful that was the answer which the reporter expected, but that was Gannon's first year in the NFL (and only year in Atlanta) as a quality control coach. That situation would certainly impact you as a young coach in the NFL and provide a harsh lesson about how quickly things can change. Gannon is navigating a very different situation in Arizona, but one that has him on the hot seat nonetheless. It's been pretty clear that Gannon feels the frustration of another losing season in Arizona, as he's now 14-26 as an NFL head coach, and that's surfaced in a variety of ways. Most notably, Gannon got tagged with a $100,000 fine for hitting Emari Demarcado on the sidelines during the Titans loss after he dropped the ball before reaching the goal line. He's also apparently not particularly interested in offering up flowery anecdotes about lessons he's learned as a coach, as evidenced by his answer that left those in his press conference without a follow-up on Wednesday.",https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/jonathan-gannon-explains-when-he-learned-to-take-emotion-out-of-coaching-when-our-quarterback-went-to-jail,Sport,cbssports.com,,https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2025/10/15/ad41cf59-443a-47bb-9b79-c9ea7d958085/thumbnail/1200x675/a1d5595e49bdf1db7df9853f99d47ee8/jonathan-gannon.jpg,2025-10-15T22:49:27+00:00,ff8c4eb7c4be76b3e47008c819e5391aa7b0b17e

McCarthy missed his entire rookie season due to a knee injury. He already missed three games this season due to an ankle injury. ""It's getting there. I wouldn't say it's 100 percent,"" McCarthy said . If it was up to McCarthy, who returned to practice on Monday and was a limited participant Wednesday, he would play when the Vikings (3-2) host the Philadelphia Eagles (4-2) on Sunday. ""We've got to be smart and understand there's a lot of things that go on. I'm just going to do what I'm told and try to get better,"" McCarthy said. The Eagles, who are on a two-game losing streak, would go up against Carson Wentz if McCarthy can't play. Wentz, who the Eagles picked No. 2 overall in the 2016 draft, started in place of McCarthy the last three weeks.

Players expressed their concerns over poor field conditions, as the grass field was said to be ""dry"" and multiple players reported kicking up chunks of the field upon making explosive movements. The field conditions wound up having a visible impact on Sunday's game, as Steelers kicker Chris Boswell missed a field goal attempt in the fourth quarter after slipping on the turf. The Steelers also lost special teams ace Miles Killebrew to a significant non-contact knee injury, which he suffered as he planted on the turf. Steelers coach Mike Tomlin had acknowledged concerns over the playing field, saying Monday that he believed the conditions were ""poor"" but noting that the field was to be swapped out following the game.

Bengals' Joe Flacco recalls his favorite moments vs. Steelers ahead of Thursday night's showdown Bryan DeArdo Playing fields have been a hot button labor issue among NFL players, as players have generally pushed for more grass fields as opposed to synthetic turf surfaces, which have been blamed for major injuries given how synthetic turf can be far more difficult on players' bodies than natural, more forgiving grass. However, an NFLPA spokesperson noted to ESPN that ""all grass surfaces aren't equal,"" as illustrated by the conditions at Acrisure Stadium on Sunday.

Pittman, who played collegiately at USC, already had one good game at Los Angeles in Week 4 at the Rams with five catches for 41 yards and a touchdown on 10 targets. And the Chargers have struggled with No. 1 receivers as Marquise Brown, Courtland Sutton, Deebo Samuel and Jaylen Waddle have each scored at least 15.5 PPR points.

2cfcc9352ca1,‘Gen V’ Actor Keeya King on Annabeth’s Heartbreaking Confession to Marie Amid Cipher Reveal,,"SPOILER ALERT : This story contains spoilers for Season 2, Episode 7 of “ Gen V ,” now streaming on Amazon’s Prime Video. It turns out Marie (Jaz Sinclair) had a very good reason for originally thinking Dean Cipher (Hamish Linklater) had no powers: He doesn’t. Toward the end of this week’s episode of “Gen V,” Marie, her sister Annabeth ( Keeya King ), Cate (Maddie Phillips) and Emma (Lizze Broadway) look on in horror as they discover the elderly burn victim man they correctly assumed was Thomas Godolkin (Ethan Slater) has been controlling Cipher this whole time. It wasn’t Cipher who had the power to control others, it was Thomas Godolkin. And from his hyperbaric chamber, Godolkin was controlling the man known as Cipher (who has no powers at all), and jumping in and out of others’ bodies as well, while he remained on life support. Until, that is, Marie brought the century-old supe back to fighting form on this week’s “Gen V,” in the hopes thatThomas Godolkin would help them stop Cipher. But too bad, he is Cipher! Now, Marie and Annabeth have Godolkin’s pending massacre plans to deal with, on top of trying to mend their fragile sibling relationship: Annabeth confesses she knew Marie was going to kill their parents by accident before it happened, and it’s haunted her ever since. Jaz Sinclair as Marie Moreau and Keeya King as Annabeth Moreau in “Gen V” Jasper Savage/Prime “She’s been completely removed from the supes, living with her Aunt Pam, and she thinks that supes are monsters. She doesn’t fully grasp her powers, nor does she really understand them,” King told Variety abiut playing Marie’s precog sister. And in her confusion over what happened to them and their parents, Annabeth’s pain and shame after their deaths turned into resentment toward Marie — she chose to blame her sister for something Annabeth knew was not Marie’s fault. The twist in the sisters’ story raises the stakes for not only Marie and Annabeth, but also for Cate, Emma, Jordan (Derek Luh/London Thor), Sam (Asa Germann) and Polarity (Sean Patrick Thomas) going into the “Gen V” Season 2 finale next week. It shifts the perspective from what the audience saw in the opening scene of Season 1 — the deaths of Marie and Annabeth’s parents — and revealed that Marie is not solely responsible for her parents’ deaths. Annabeth could have said something and stopped it. Hamish Linklater as Dean Cipher in “Gen V” Jasper Savage/Prime “I’ve watched the show, and I’m like, ‘OK, Annabeth thinks that Marie killed her parents,'” King said. “And then when I sat down with our showrunner, Michelle, she actually explained to me the path that the writers had for Annabeth, which is that she actually had these visions and she’s been holding onto them for a very long time. “As an actor, it’s sort of weaving in little moments of pain and regret of not acting on those visions, and then also sort of blaming my sister as well,” she continued. “Because when you’re upset with yourself, sometimes it’s like, ‘Where do I place that hurt?’ So sometimes she does place it on Marie, her sister.”",https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/gen-v-godolkin-cipher-identity-marie-annabeth-parents-death-1236553598,Entertainment,variety.com,Jennifer Maas,https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Gen-V-4.jpg?w=1000&h=563&crop=1,2025-10-15T23:30:00+00:00,3ec94e91345fc63640f4044dd1227a6ba2080de4

Thank you, darling.’ And this guy comes over and he pushes her outta the way, and he shoves Woody. Bad. Because Woody’s first response is not ‘shove someone back,’ but ‘immediately punch them in the face.’ Which is the right thing to do, by the way. It’s the absolute right thing to do. But then a whole melee broke out in this bar. I was in the middle of it and it was turning into a— it was getting to become a whole thing… And I grabbed [Woody].” “I grabbed [Woody] and I pulled him out,” Ruffalo continued. “Because I was like, ‘This could be fun, but it also just could go so disastrously wrong because you and I might be able to handle ourselves but the rest of the folks we were with… I don’t think so.” Ruffalo and Harrelson starred in “Now You See Me” alongside Jesse Eisenberg, Mélanie Laurent, Isla Fisher, Dave Franco, Morgan Freeman and more. The movie was a box office hit with $351 million worldwide and spawned a franchise that led to 2016’s “Now You See Me 2” and the upcoming “Now You See Me: Now You Don’t,” in theaters Nov. 14.

Both teams pulled off two consecutive road wins to open the LCS round of the 2025 MLB playoffs. In the ALCS, the Toronto Blue Jays hitters finally showed some life as the offense powered the team to a 13-4 blowout Game 3 win Wednesday night as the series moved to Seattle. They'll look to continue that momentum into Game 4. The Dodgers are up 2-0 against the Milwaukee Brewers after Yoshinobu Yamamoto threw a complete game gem in Tuesday's Game 2 win. The Dodgers, now 7-1 in the playoffs, allowed just two runs to the Brewers in the first two games of the NLCS. The Mariners punched their ticket to their first ALCS since 2001 last week by eliminating the Tigers in 15 innings in a winner-take-all ALDS Game 5. The Blue Jays knocked out the Yankees in the ALDS. The Dodgers, meanwhile, took out the Phillies in four games in the NLDS, and the Brewers got past the Cubs in five games.

d95a595e80de,"USA soccer has another upcoming talent with a bright future, but European national team is making a push",,"American midfielder Rokas Pukstas made the move to Barcelona's academy from Sporting Kansas City in 2020, and now shining for Croatian club Hajuk Split, Pukstas is wanted by more than just U.S. Soccer. The 21-year-old is rebuffing interest from Lithuania while keeping the door open for the United States in the future. Pukstas is in the midst of a strong season with the Croatian side, already scoring four goals in nine league appearances. Due to Pukstas' parents being Lithuanian, the midfielder is also eligible to represent the nation, but when they've called, he's been clear that his heart is set on representing the United States. Born in Stillwater, Okla., Pukstas has represented the United States at youth levels, but he hasn't been capped since the U-20 World Cup, where he appeared in midfield in June of 2023 under Mikey Varas. ""Being a dual national, you get calls from Lithuania, but I made clear, I made it direct that I'm here to play for the USA,"" Pukstas said on CBS Sports Golazo's Morning Footy. ""That's where my heart is, so they know where my heart is, and that's what I tell them."" Pukstas added that he hasn't had conversations with the current USMNT regime under Mauricio Pochettino, but having represented the youth teams and been around the federation, he knows what he needs to focus on. Being the best he can be at his club and helping Hajuk Split win matches is what Pukstas can control, and he's doing just that after also getting to improve playing alongside a legend in Ivan Rakitic. Rakitic is now in the Hajduk Split front office, but he spent the 2024-25 season with the club before retiring, which was a transformative time for Pukstas. He was able to learn from the midfielder and how he sees the field, and it's showing this season. ""I asked him a step-by-step process of how he approaches it, you know, and he took me through everything,"" Pukstas said. ""He took me through all his small details that he's learned. So just everything that he's given to me, I'm more than grateful."" It's something that can be helpful, having club legends around, but credit must be given to Pukstas for soaking up everything that he could in their time together. His journey has been far from an average one, and seeing his old teammates do well for their clubs and with the USMNT is something that gives Pukstas confidence that he can make the breakthrough, too. ""The guys like Diego Luna, Jack McGlynn, you see them, and you know, I was in their cycle with them for two to three years, so we saw each other develop,"" Pukstas said. ""So it's great to see these guys, you know, perform, not only play, but perform for the team. So it gives me confidence because I was there with them, too, and it also makes me happy that they're performing so well."" Only 21, even if Pukstas doesn't make this World Cup squad, there's plenty of time for him to make that breakthrough. His team are level with Dinamo Zagreb atop the Croatian Football League, which could also lead to Pukstas gaining Champions League experience. Already appearing in UEFA Conference League qualifiers this campaign, the UCL would provide more opportunities for Pukstas to continue his upward trajectory and get onto the USMNT roster.",https://www.cbssports.com/soccer/news/usa-soccer-has-another-upcoming-talent-with-a-bright-future-but-european-national-team-is-making-a-push,Sport,cbssports.com,,https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2025/10/15/b31360dd-c263-46cb-9308-4a387f54c1cd/thumbnail/1200x675/6a7a52ed2a02d724a5f16c0e60b06661/uswnt-1.jpg,2025-10-16T02:35:00+00:00,122ab6ee146f64e1bbd9e1b5bf327d6ffabb4f0f

Per the NFL , Branch's appeal was heard by Jordy Nelson , the longtime receiver who now works as an appeals officer for the leagur. Branch initiated a fight after the Lions' 30-17 loss to the Chiefs, as he punched receiver JuJu Smith-Schuster following the game-ending kneeldown, triggering a larger skirmish between the two teams. Branch was publicly admonished for his actions by Lions coach Dan Campbell, and he himself expressed remorse despite saying that he had been frustrated with Smith-Schuster's actions during the game. "" I did a real childish thing ,""  Branch said. ""I'm tired of people doing stuff in between plays and refs  don't catch it. They be trying to bully me out there. I shouldn't have  did it, it was childish."" NFL suspends Brian Branch without pay for initiating postgame brawl between Lions, Chiefs Bryan DeArdo Branch's suspension marks the latest disciplinary action taken toward him by the NFL league office. Branch has already been fined 14 times in his NFL career including four times this season. Prior to Sunday night, Branch had been fined a combined $34,784 for one unsportsmanlike conduct infraction and two unnecessary roughness penalties. Branch's suspension deprives the Lions defense of one of their best players entering another tough matchup, as they will play in primetime on Monday night against the 5-1 Tampa Bay Buccaneers.",https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/lions-safety-brian-branch-loses-appeal-of-one-game-suspension-will-miss-week-7-after-post-game-fight,Sport,cbssports.com,,https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2025/10/16/a783c884-860c-45fc-bdbb-1dcae5618867/thumbnail/1200x675/554a9440107a8c9cd0274e24fb610a06/gettyimages-2240354615.jpg,2025-10-16T01:02:33+00:00,121e6a04be62cc1a23b69b097bf5ba97382a2973

With the CFP now using a straight-seeding model -- giving the top four teams in the rankings first-round byes -- the battle for at-large bids and the committee's bubble decisions have started to reshape how we view the second half of the season. Before the year, we each took our shot at predicting the first 12-team Playoff and the eventual national champion. Some of those picks couldn't have aged worse -- I was one of three who tabbed Penn State as the No. 1 overall seed and national champion. Thankfully, our editors are giving us a midseason mulligan to re-pick our CFP bracket and national champion. We've also updated our Heisman Trophy and Coach of the Year selections. And while it's unlikely our new champion pick will have fired its coach by season's end, college football in 2025 has proven that just about anything is possible when it comes to the sport's elite programs. College Football Playoff predictions Top four seeds get first-round byes Rest of field (No. 5-12) 2025 national champion Ohio State : As other contenders stumble in the first half of the season, Ohio State's almost made it look easy in cruising to 6-0. Yes, Texas and Washington pushed the Buckeyes a bit, but those games were never in any serious doubt. And a very good Illinois team couldn't do anything against OSU until garbage time. The Buckeyes have a top five defense and a top 20 offense, and it really does feel like that offensive unit can hit another gear or two. Given the path for Ohio State to the playoff (no remaining Top 25 opponents on the schedule) and its talent, I think Ohio State is the obvious pick at the midway point to win the national title. -- Chris Hummer (also Shehan Jeyarajah, Tom Fornelli, Brandon Marcello, Brad Crawford, Richard Johnson) Miami : Miami could get to the College Football Playoff blindfolded at this point, as the Hurricanes are likely to be favored by at least a touchdown in their final seven games. Once the 'Canes get there, they have all the ingredients of a team that can win it all. In Year 4 under coach Mario Cristobal, Miami finally has the heft and talent on both lines of scrimmage to withstand the rigors of a 16-game grind. Miami's capability of offensive explosiveness is also standing out. Georgia transfer quarterback Carson Beck is looking like the 2023 version of himself, thanks in large part to the emergence for star receivers Malachi Toney and CJ Daniels . Few, if any, teams have been tested as thoroughly as Miami, and the Hurricanes have passed each assignment with flying colors. There is no reason to doubt this team's bona fides as a championship contender. -- David Cobb (also John Talty) Alabama : The season opening loss to Florida State was the wake-up call that this Alabama team needed to remember the thin margin for error when it comes to playing at the top of the sport. And this prediction is not to say that Alabama will win the rest of its games, either, as recent wins against Georgia, Vanderbilt and Missouri put that thin margin on full display before the Crimson Tide came up with the game-winning plays late. But when you are operating on the margins you need a difference-maker, and to me that's Ty Simpson . He's playing like one of the best quarterbacks in the country right now and according to the players in that locker room he's one of the team's leaders and most important voices. After years of sticking with the Tide, and not transferring, I think his moment here in 2025 includes leading Alabama back to where fans believe they belong: at the top of college football's mountain. -- Chip Patterson Midseason Coach of the Year Joey McGuire, Texas Tech : It's one thing to have a talented roster, it's another to win the games, and Joey McGuire is doing nothing but win early this year. The Red Raiders are 6-0 and have the highest average scoring margin (30.4 points) of any team in college football. Yes, McGuire had the offseason resources to go out and get players. But it looks like he's made all the right calls. The roster upgrades are almost all hits, and both of Texas Tech's new coordinators have excelled. The Red Raiders are in the conversation to be the best team in the country. That's remarkable given where that program's been over the last decade -- Hummer (also Jeyarajah) Curt Cignetti, Indiana : Cignetti has guided Indiana to a 6-0 start and its highest-ever ranking in the AP poll while proving that last season's 11 wins and CFP appearance were anything but a fluke. The Hoosiers' Week 7 triumph at Oregon is in the running for best college football victory of the season, and it brings the possibility of 12-0 campaign closer to reality. This isn't just the best coaching job of the season; what Cignetti is doing at Indiana may be the best coaching job of the 21st century. -- Cobb (also Johnson, Marcello) Tony Elliot, Virginia : It's admittedly close with Indiana's Curt Cignetti, but Elliott has done more with less than nearly any coach in college football this season. The Cavaliers are one red-zone conversion away from being unbeaten and ranked inside the top 10 at midseason — something no one saw coming two months ago with a 31-player transfer class ranked outside the top 25 nationally. The fact that this team still controls its ACC title and playoff hopes in mid-October is an impressive feat on its own. The home win over then-unbeaten Florida State was special. -- Crawford (also Talty) Mario Cristobal, Miami: One of the pieces of coaching that can be the most valuable is the ability to successfully imprint an identity on your locker room. Miami fans might have been dreaming of the old days when Cristobal stepped to the podium at his introductory press conference, but in reality what he wanted from this program was the foundational element of physicality pushed into the future for a new era. You can't spend all your time trying to recreate Miami's success from a bygone era, and Cristobal has successfully gotten the entire program to buy in on the blend of old school physicality in the trenches while embracing the on-field and off-field aspects of modern football. Miami's got one of the best offensive line-defensive line combinations in the entire country, and that's a byproduct of four great years of recruiting and developing the part of the field that Cristobal values the most. Getting the entire program to buy in on the plan and seeing it play out in an undefeated 5-0 start and No. 2 national ranking? That's just great coaching. -- Patterson (also Fornelli) Heisman Trophy frontrunner Ty Simpson, Alabama: -- Not only has Simpson been statistically great, he's also been on point in key situations during Alabama's five-game winning streak. He was dialed in during a game-defining first half in a victory at Georgia, steady and accurate in a win over Vanderbilt and clutch again late in a win at Missouri. All three of those wins came against top-20 opponents, and two of them were on the road. Simpson's pinpoint accuracy is his best trait, and when you combine that with some mobility and confidence, you get elite quarterback play. That's what Simpson has been providing for the Crimson Tide, especially in big moments against quality opponents. -- Cobb (also Johnson, Fornelli) Carson Beck, Miami: Filling the shoes of a Heisman finalist is no easy task, especially given how 2024 ended for Carson Beck, but he's been terrific for the Hurricanes. In three wins over top-25 opponents, Beck has thrown nine touchdown passes with a sparkling completion rate. Miami offensive coordinator Shannon Dawson identified his guy early in the portal, and the Hurricanes made it happen. Expect to see Beck in New York a few months from now — likely with Miami preparing for its first playoff appearance as a No. 1 or No. 2 seed in the final regular-season rankings.-- Crawford (also Marcello, Talty) Trinidad Chambliss , Ole Miss : The Heisman Trophy is a story award at heart, and there is no better story in college football than Chambliss. The senior did not start at Division II Ferris State until 2024, but has taken the sport by storm since transferring to Oxford. He has averaged more than 390 yards per game as a starter, which would lead the nation. If the Rebels can finish the job and earn a trip to the SEC title game and College Football Playoff, few will have better or more compelling cases when the award is finally handed out. A road trip to No. 9 Georgia this weekend marks a pivotal opportunity. -- (Jeyarajah)",https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/news/college-football-predictions-second-chance-expert-picks-for-2025-national-champion-playoff-field-more,Sport,cbssports.com,,https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2025/10/15/078035b6-e0a7-4ed2-bae0-f789b4efad1d/thumbnail/1200x675/ebe75b014193b460b16602ccbb35f2fe/img-4198.png,2025-10-16T00:55:00+00:00,eb6d67938dd4ca13dcd78056c10517fb35e67ac2
5f5e996503f2,USMNT's starting XI and depth chart if the 2026 FIFA World Cup started today: Cristian Roldan making his case,,"The October international break has come to a close for the United States men's national team on a positive note, defeating Australia 2-1 . Slowly, Mauricio Pochettino is restoring faith that this team can topple top opposition around the world as they're now on a three-match unbeaten run, and we're learning more about his roster by the day. The shift to a back three has been a positive one, and while questions may still remain around the team , panic is beginning to lessen. But with the World Cup drawing closer, it brings up an important question -- if the tournament started today, what would the starting XI look like? I took a stab at answering that, and here's how things shook out. 2026 roster projection Goalkeepers (3): Matt Freese (New York City FC), Matt Turner ( New England Revolution ), Patrick Schulte ( Columbus Crew ) Defenders (8): Sergino Dest (PSV), Antonee Robinson ( Fulham ), Miles Robinson (FC Cincinnati), Chris Richards (Crystal Palace), Tim Ream (Fulham), Alex Freeman (Orlando City SC), Max Arfsten (Columbus Crew), Mark McKenzie ( Toulouse ) Midfielders (7): Weston McKennie (Juventus), Tyler Adams (Bournemouth), Diego Luna ( Real Salt Lake ), Luca De La Torre (San Diego FC), Cristian Roldan ( Seattle Sounders ), Malik Tillman ( Bayer Leverkusen ), Tanner Tessemann ( Lyon ) Forwards (6): Christian Pulisic (Milan), Folarin Balogun ( Monaco ), Ricardo Pepi (PSV), Tim Weah (Marseille), Patrick Agyemang (Derby County), Haji Wright (Coventry City), Alex Zendejas (Club America) Goalkeeper Starter: Matt Freese Backups: Matt Turner, Patrick Schulte The year of Matt Freese continues with the keeper now starting 11 consecutive games for the USMNT between the Gold Cup and friendlies. Showing what he can do in penalty shootouts, even the return of Matt Turner wasn't enough to see Freese miss out on minutes between the sticks. Pochettino hasn't outright awarded the New York City FC man the starting job, but unless there's an injury or a major dip in performance, keeper is one of the few set positions for the USMNT as the World Cup approaches. Right wing back Starter: Sergino Dest Backups: Alex Freeman, Tim Weah And just like that, we get to chaos. Tim Weah could easily continue in a fake wing back role where he helps overwhelm opposing attackers, especially since Sergino Dest hasn't been healthy enough to play a full 90 minutes for the USMNT this year. Dest's verisitlity could also work against him as he's one of the primary backups for Antonee Robinosn on the right, so if Pochettino needs to cut a wing back, it could make sense to have Dest as the primary backup on both sides. Alex Freeman has been one of the biggest risers in the entire squad during this year, and I'd find it tough to cut him from any potential World Cup squad. Center back Starters: Chris Richards, Tim Ream, Miles Robinson Backups: Mark McKenzie This is probably too light in central defense, but coming by defenders who have impressed enough to get the call to the World Cup has been tough. One of Tristan Blackmon or Cameron Carter-Vickers will likely be needed if the back three is hear to stay, but the starting trio feels locked in at this stage. Miles Robinson has been a strong performer under Pochettino, and alongside Richards, his anticipation helps make up for Tim Ream's lack of pace. While it'd be great to find a contingency plan for Ream if anything were to happen, that is something that could be easier said than done for this squad, so I wouldn't hold my breath there. Left wing back Starter: Antonee Robinson Backup: Max Arfsten, Sergino Dest Another position where it's clear who the starter is, Antonee Robinson is one of the first names on the entire USMNT team sheet. Max Arfsten has had great showings as a wing back due to what he can bring going forward, but Robinson's consistency is what could cause issues in relation to the Columbus Crew man sticking on the roster. With Dest being able to back up both positions and the need for another center back, this is where Pochettino will have some decisions to make. Central midfield Starters : Tyler Adams, Weston McKennie Backups: Tanner Tessmann, Cristian Roldan, Luca De La Torre The defensive mistakes during the October international window, which Tyler Adams missed due to the birth of his child, showed yet again that no one can replace what he brings to the midfield. Adams captained the USMNT at the 2022 World Cup and is still one of the leaders on the pitch when healthy. Now, next to him is where things get interesting. Weston McKennie made his return to camp and would still seem to be the favorite to start, but with Cristian Roldan putting in good shifts and assisting Haji Wright twice, things could get interesting. There is a world where Roldan is the starting USMNT midfielder in a double pivot when the World Cup kicks off, especially as Pochettino called him a ""perfect player"" following the victory over Australia. Tanner Tessmann is trending in the right direction, but if only two deeper midfielders are starting, it will be tough to break into the starting XI. Attacking midfield Starter: Malik Tillman Backups: Diego Luna Without Gio Reyna in the squad, Malik Tillman becomes the x-factor for the USMNT. Able to play centrally and float out onto the wing, he brings versatility to how the attack can set up. Growing into his role at a bigger club at Bayer Leverkusen, Tillman is also developing more confidence as a player, which will help lead the USMNT attack when the lights are at their brightest. If a change of pace is needed, Diego Luna isn't afraid to take anyone on and will be ready for the moment. This is one of the few positions that doesn't change much in a back three or a back four. Forwards Starters: Folarin Balogun, Christian Pulisic Backups: Tim Weah, Haji Wright, Ricardo Pepi, Patrick Agyemang, Alex Zendejas Sitting Weah here is hard, as even when he's not at his best, the USMNT are better with him on the pitch. Weah very well may be played in defense, but he'll still be expected to contribute to the attack. Folarin Balogun has come into his own and brings a different class to the nine for the USMNT, raising the bar of what they can accomplish as a squad when he's on the pitch. It's similar to what Christian Pulisic brings which is why along with Robinson, they're locked in no matter what. Haji Wright has shown what he can bring coming off the bench or starting, and who knows, after being the last player to score a World Cup goal for the USMNT, he just may be the first player to score a goal in 2026 on home soil for the USMNT.",https://www.cbssports.com/soccer/news/usmnts-starting-xi-and-depth-chart-if-the-2026-fifa-world-cup-started-today-cristian-roldan-making-his-case,Sport,cbssports.com,,https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2025/10/16/03e4353b-6d43-4bd1-b93e-305ad4ca9309/thumbnail/1200x675/6e51ff2ae3e1f07ca4aac7bf2e110eaf/roldan.jpg,2025-10-16T00:48:08+00:00,3b0f096320be81d6268666d37a0c47f554fec46a
92ba12501acf,"Fantasy Football Week 7 Lineup Decisions: Who to start, who to sit, must-start plays, flex plays and more",,"Fantasy Football is all about the matchups. Even though you drafted your team with certain hopes and intentions, your weekly lineup decisions shouldn't be determined by the order you picked your players in. You need to check who your players play and make sure you've got the right guys in -- and the wrong guys out. We can take some educated guesses based on coaches film, meaningful data, healthy personnel, defensive schemes, track records, and key details of offenses. The things we know can help us minimize the impact of the things we don't know. This should lead to better decisions being made. We'll go through every game and highlight the players who aren't obvious starts and sits (because you don't need to be told to sit Elic Ayomanor). You should feel more comfortable starting or sitting players based on the information given, and feeling comfortable with your Fantasy lineup before the games start is the best feeling in the world. All lines from Caesars Sportsbook . There's been only one game when the Steelers had over 100 rush yards from their running backs: against the Vikings in Ireland in Week 4. Not only have they been under 90 RB rush yards in their other games (all with Jaylen Warren ), but they've failed to average even 3.7 yards per carry in those games. Enter the Bengals , who in their past four have allowed 4.9 yards per rush to running backs and are bottom-six in defensive total rush EPA and success rate allowed, with five rushing touchdowns given up. It's a good spot on a short week to try and get the run game going, even with Warren leading the charge. Warren led the Steelers run game last week against a tough Browns defense with 4.7 yards per rush on 11 carries while playing 63% of the snaps in the first three quarters. Tee Higgins has posted 11.2 PPR points in each of his past two games. Those are tied for the fifth-best games he's put together in his career without Joe Burrow on the field with him. Gross, right? Well, it gets worse: In three of the other four games Higgins played well in without Burrow, Ja'Marr Chase was either injured or not yet in the NFL ! So, just to drive the point home, Higgins has one career game with more than 12 PPR points with Chase active and Burrow not active. Joe Flacco seems to be a small upgrade for both receivers, so there's hope Higgins can nail down some weeks closer to 15 PPR points. Against the Browns last week was the second time Pittsburgh didn't allow a receiver to notch 15-plus PPR points in a game this season; the first was New England in Week 3. The problem for Higgins is that it's been high-volume No. 1 receivers (like Chase) who have brought home big numbers against the Steelers. Due to scarcity at the position, Higgins is a high-end No. 3 or flex receiver this week as expectations remain mid. MUST-STARTS : Ja'Marr Chase STARTS : DK Metcalf , Jaylen Warren (PPR), Steelers DST FLEX : Tee Higgins, Chase Brown SITS : Aaron Rodgers (high-end No. 2 QB), Joe Flacco, Kenneth Gainwell (desperation PPR RB), Jonnu Smith (desperation TE), Noah Fant , Darnell Washington , Andrei Iosivas , Pat Freiermuth , Samaje Perine , Bengals DST Jacksonville's pass rush pressure rate has dipped under 32% in its past two games as stud Travon Walker has either missed time or been limited. No surprise, they have two total sacks in those games. Giving Matthew Stafford time to throw, even against zone-heavy coverage, is a recipe for a loss, but I'm not sure the Jaguars are willing to blitz a lot more even without Puka Nacua on the field. Tutu Atwell has stepped up as recently as last year when the Rams have had injured receivers, as he adds a speed element while capable of lining up everywhere. The Jaguars have been burned by big plays and speedy receivers all season, making Atwell someone with sleeper appeal. Stafford also carries some sleeper appeal, even without Nacua, because the matchup doesn't figure to be that difficult. Jaguars coach Liam Coen emphasized this week that the team needs to do a better job running the ball, but he's got a tough opponent to do it against. The Rams are the only team left to not allow a running back to rush for a touchdown against them, and they're also the team to hold Saquon Barkley , Jonathan Taylor , Christian McCaffrey and Derrick Henry to a combined 3.5-yard rushing average over the past four weeks (Henry wound up averaging 4.6 yards per run last week but didn't have a run longer than 12 yards). That matchup works against Travis Etienne , which is why Fantasy managers should hope for a continued workload through the air. Etienne has nine targets and seven catches in his past two games, salvageable numbers for his PPR floor. That keeps him in the No. 2 RB range, even in a tough spot. MUST-STARTS : Kyren Williams , Davante Adams STARTS : Brian Thomas Jr. , Travis Etienne, Rams DST FLEX : Tutu Atwell (No. 3 WR) SITS : Matthew Stafford (high-end No. 2 QB), Trevor Lawrence , Jordan Whittington , Travis Hunter , Parker Washington , Dyami Brown , Bhayshul Tuten , Blake Corum , LeQuint Allen I'm always keyed in on matchups of ex-defensive playcallers taking on their former teams, and ex-Saints coach Dennis Allen is in that exact spot this week as his old team takes on his current team in Chicago. Allen's guys are on a roll -- they held the Commanders to 3.5 yards per carry last week, thanks in large part to the return of linebacker T.J. Edwards and some really solid play from their secondary to limit big plays. Saints QB Spencer Rattler seems to be about the same against man and zone coverages, and pressure versus no-pressure pass rushes, but I figure Allen knows his strengths and weaknesses best and will put his improved defense in a position to slow the entire Saints offense down. That could make for a one-sided game for the Bears , and thus providing opportunities for Caleb Williams and D'Andre Swift (even against a suddenly stingy Saints run defense) to keep up their solid play from Monday night. MUST-STARTS : Rome Odunze STARTS : Caleb Williams, D'Andre Swift, Bears DST (one-week only) FLEX : Chris Olave (PPR), Alvin Kamara SITS : Spencer Rattler, Rashid Shaheed (desperation flex), Luther Burden (stash), Olamide Zaccheaus , Taysom Hill , Juwan Johnson , Kendre Miller , Colston Loveland (stash), Kyle Monangai , Saints DST The primary reason why you're starting Harold Fannin Jr . is because he figures to see a lot of targets with tight end David Njoku sidelined. Dillon Gabriel has targeted tight ends on 36.1% of his throws in his two starts -- that's massive, guys. Taking on a struggling Dolphins defense helps, as they've let up at least 11 PPR points to Dalton Kincaid , Mason Taylor , and Oronde Gadsden in the last four weeks (no one on the Panthers could come through in Week 5). Fannin is much more of a receiver than a blocker, which is good, and he has some nice versatility in his routes, even though he doesn't always play with good speed. Unless Quinshon Judkins runs roughshod over the Dolphins, which is possible, Fannin should be solid. When these teams played last year, the Browns blitzed about a third of the time, got plenty of pass rush pressure on the quarterback, and even sacked him four times. Yet the Dolphins won 20-3 and the quarterback -- Tyler Huntley -- completed nearly 85% of his passes for 8.7 yards per attempt and scored 26.2 Fantasy points (rushing yardage and a rush TD helped). The point is that even with the Browns' aggressive pass rush, the Dolphins figure to come up with something to keep the game competitive. I would guess it would be a lot of quick throws, much like Miami has resumed doing ( Tua Tagovailoa's 2.62 average time to throw ranks third fastest out of 34 qualifiers). It's tough to expect a big game from Tagovailoa this way, which is why any quarterback with a modest floor and high ceiling is a better play than he is. MUST-STARTS : De'Von Achane STARTS : Quinshon Judkins, Jaylen Waddle (No. 2 WR), Darren Waller , Harold Fannin SITS : Tua Tagovailoa, Dillon Gabriel, Jerry Jeudy (desperation flex), Jerome Ford (desperation PPR RB), Isaiah Bond , Julian Hill , Malik Washington , Ollie Gordon II , Browns DST, Dolphins DST The domino effect of Rashee Rice's return from suspension should result in some downgrades across the board for Chiefs players not named Patrick Mahomes . Both last year and in the preseason this year, Kansas City deployed Rice as a short- and intermediate target who lined up in the slot roughly half of his snaps. That's what Hollywood Brown and JuJu Smith-Schuster have been doing for the first six weeks of the season. And because Rice figures to command a lot of those short-range throws (especially against zone-leaning Las Vegas), Travis Kelce's 18% target share figures to take a dip. The Chiefs already have the seventh-highest pass rate in non-garbage time this season, so it's not like Rice's return will do anything to alter how many touches their running backs get. If anything, the matchup against the Raiders may offer some short-yardage touchdown chances for the running backs since Las Vegas has allowed five RB scores in their past three games (four inside the 3-yard line). If you're desperate, Kareem Hunt might be the guy to get you 10 Fantasy points ... but Rashee Rice should be good for much more than that if catches count. MUST-STARTS : Patrick Mahomes STARTS : Rashee Rice, Ashton Jeanty , Xavier Worthy (low-end No. 2 WR), Travis Kelce (low-end TE), Chiefs DST FLEX : Tre Tucker , Jakobi Meyers , Kareem Hunt (low-end non-PPR flex) SITS : Geno Smith , Marquise Brown (desperation WR), Michael Mayer (desperation TE), Tyquan Thornton , Isiah Pacheco , JuJu Smith-Schuster, Jack Bech , Raheem Mostert , Raiders DST Not having cornerback Quinyon Mitchell would be a big problem, as just about every other outside cornerback they've tried has struggled. The Eagles pass rush has also been an issue -- they have nine sacks in six games and have struggled to generate pressure on a game-to-game basis. Having defensive tackle Jalen Carter back would be huge (literally!), but the Vikings offensive line figures to be a lot healthier coming out of their bye, making the matchup easier for them and tougher for Philly. And if the Eagles' defense struggles like they did last week, then their offense will have no choice but to throw, just as they have in their games whenever they've trailed. MUST-STARTS : Jalen Hurts , Justin Jefferson , Saquon Barkley STARTS : A.J. Brown (low-end No. 2 WR), Jordan Addison (low-end No. 2 WR), Jordan Mason (low-end No. 2 RB), Dallas Goedert , Eagles DST FLEX : DeVonta Smith (high-end flex) SITS : Carson Wentz , T.J. Hockenson (high-end No. 2 TE), Jahan Dotson , Zavier Scott , A.J. Dillon, Will Shipley The Broncos pass rush completely humiliated the Jets offensive line last week, getting pass rush pressure on 58.6% of Justin Fields ' dropbacks. For the Jets, this isn't anything new: a 47.2% pass rush pressure rate allowed by the Cowboys in Week 5 was an improvement compared to the 50%+ rate allowed to the Bills , Buccaneers , and Dolphins (!) in Weeks 2 through 4. In fact, three of the top-five most pressure rates allowed have come against the Jets. That's not all on the O-line -- it's also on Fields holding the ball too long or running around before making a decision on where to throw (or to run). Carolina's pass rush is among the most tepid in football, but even they should be able to get some pressure on Fields. They've already improved their run defense now that they're healthier up front (a league-best 1.5 yards per carry allowed against the Dolphins and Cowboys), and their secondary has been mostly good this year. Not having the receiver responsible for 29% of Fields' completions, 35% of Fields' yards, and 75% of Fields' passing touchdowns isn't exactly a good thing either. Fields clearly has the upside to run for 50 yards and a touchdown; it's everything else that he may or may not do that comes into question, including the Jets' desire to throw the ball, something they've done just 49.2% of their snaps with Fields outside of garbage time. STARTS : Rico Dowdle , Breece Hall , Tetairoa McMillan , Mason Taylor (low-end PPR TE) SITS : Bryce Young , Justin Fields, Jalen Coker , Josh Reynolds , Tommy Tremble , Isaiah Davis , Tyler Johnson , Panthers DST, Jets DST The easiest thing the Titans can do to change their fortunes, at least offensively, is work to get the ball out of Cam Ward's hand faster. That'll be in play this week against a Patriots defense that's been great against the run and has the potential to wreck a game with its pass rush. Reliable short-area targets like Chig Okonkwo and Tyjae Spears should be blended into the game plan along with more work for veteran pass-catchers like Van Jefferson and Tyler Lockett . Spears specifically ran much better than Tony Pollard last week at Las Vegas and also caught four passes to Pollard's two. Between changing things up and a likely negative game script, you could feasibly buy into Spears as the better PPR option. This is more of an observation than a prediction: Last week, TreVeyon Henderson's quickness and vision were unquestionably better than Stevenson's. Henderson had at least four yards on 6 of 9 runs, and Stevenson had four-plus on 3 of 13 runs. The reason why I'm not predicting anything is because we've seen Henderson have better efficiency than Stevenson before, and it's led to no discernible change in their usage. I'm certain that the day is coming when Henderson will lead this backfield, but I can't predict it for this week, even if the matchup is more favorable for Henderson to attack the Titans' edges rather than have Stevenson plow into interior linemen. STARTS : Drake Maye , Patriots DST (should be good in Week 8 too) FLEX : Stefon Diggs (high-end PPR flex), Rhamondre Stevenson (low-end flex), Tyjae Spears (low-end PPR flex) SITS : Cam Ward, Tony Pollard (desperation RB), TreVeyon Henderson (sneaky sleeper), Kayshon Boutte (desperation WR), Chig Okonkwo, Van Jefferson, Elic Ayomanor , Demario Douglas , Hunter Henry , Titans DST This feels like the week where the Jaxson Dart train slows down. Denver's defense has rapidly climbed to the top of the league in explosive RB runs allowed (two), RB rushing touchdowns allowed (one), pass rush pressure rate (46.5%), and sacks (30!). A lot of that had to do with their drubbing of the Jets last week, but even before last week, they were second in pass rush pressure rate and first in sacks with 21. New York deserves credit for improving its pass protection and for letting Dart play fast and loose, but this road matchup seems too tough for Dart to overcome. MUST-STARTS : Courtland Sutton STARTS : Cam Skattebo , JK Dobbins , Evan Engram (borderline PPR starter), Broncos DST FLEX : Wan'Dale Robinson (PPR) SITS : Bo Nix , Jaxson Dart, Theo Johnson , R.J. Harvey, Troy Franklin , Marvin Mims , Lil'Jordan Humphrey , Tyrone Tracy Jr. , Jalin Hyatt , Giants DST Playing against the terrible Dolphins run defense (minus a starting linebacker) obviously was a factor, but Kimani Vidal looked pretty dang good weaving his way. He seemed to rotate drives with Hassan Haskins until the third quarter, when the coaches opted to ride Vidal's hot hand, something he rewarded them with gains of 27, 13, and 7 yards on consecutive plays. Vidal had a number of big gains but didn't flash top-notch speed, getting ground on quick vision and finishing with power. Indianapolis' run defense is improving, lowering their rushing average against to a better-than-average 4.0 yards while limiting explosive plays to just 2.4%. That's a wake-up call for Vidal's Fantasy managers -- expecting another big game from him might be too much to ask for. However, it's not a mistake to figure he'll see a good dose of work on the ground and through the air, enough to keep him in No. 2 RB territory, just not top-10 territory. MUST-STARTS : Jonathan Taylor, Tyler Warren , Michael Pittman STARTS : Justin Herbert , Daniel Jones , Ladd McConkey , Kimani Vidal (low-end No. 2 RB), Colts DST (borderline start) FLEX : Keenan Allen , Josh Downs (PPR) SITS : Oronde Gadsden, Alec Pierce , Hassan Haskins, Chargers DST Bam Knight proved to be the better Cardinals running back last week, but it took a while for him to get his chance. Michael Carter started and dominated snaps until the Cardinals got near the goal line and changed him out for Emari Demercado for a play, then Knight for two, including his touchdown plunge. It wasn't until the Cardinals' fifth drive of the first half that Knight got a real opportunity to play, and from then on, he took on most of the snaps until the fourth quarter, when the Cardinals were trailing and Carter played in the hurry-up offense. It's that last note that makes me think Carter could be the better back this week -- the Packers figure to build a lead, if not keep the game competitive, pushing the game script closer to the Cardinals working at a quick rate. He's the better passing-downs back. Using either Arizona running back is a big-time risk, but in PPR formats (and maybe even non-PPR), Carter figures to be the better bet. Any game the Cowboys are in has shootout potential -- they've scored 27-plus in four of their past five and have allowed 30-plus in four of their past five (and 22 points in each game). Dallas' defense has shown flashes of life over the past two weeks, but it's not on the same level as Washington's. Dan Quinn's unit has thrived on man coverage (especially when trailing) and has started to win with pass rush pressure (14 sacks in their past four games, including a one-sack disappointment at Atlanta). That should give the Commanders an edge -- and a chance to get their offense fully back on track, run game included. MUST STARTS : Jayden Daniels , Dak Prescott , CeeDee Lamb , Deebo Samuel STARTS : Javonte Williams , Jacory Croskey-Merritt , George Pickens , Jake Ferguson SITS : Zach Ertz (No. 2 TE), Luke McCaffrey , Chris Moore , Jeremy McNichols , Commanders DST, Cowboys DST Jauan Jennings deserves credit for playing with all the ailments he claims. I thought his film from Week 6 was a mixed bag -- he flashed quick agility, but his straight-line speed didn't impress. Kendrick Bourne was about as solid, and he's healthier and was on the same page as Mac Jones , so it's easy to understand why he had so many more targets than Jennings. But change is coming: Not only did George Kittle start the week practicing, but so too did Brock Purdy . There's no reason for the 49ers to pull Bourne off the field if Purdy starts and Mac Jones sits, but the relationship Purdy has with Kittle and Jennings isn't the same as what he has with Bourne. It makes me nervous to trust either receiver, and the matchup against a suddenly upstart Falcons pass rush and pass defense (with top cornerback A.J. Terrell ) doesn't make anything easier. MUST-STARTS : Christian McCaffrey, Bijan Robinson , Drake London STARTS : George Kittle, Kyle Pitts (if Darnell Mooney is out), Falcons DST (low-end starter) FLEX : Jauan Jennings (if Brock Purdy plays), Kendrick Bourne (if Mac Jones plays) SITS : Mac Jones, Michael Penix Jr. , Tyler Allgeier (desperation RB), Brian Robinson Jr. , Demarcus Robinson , 49ers DST Five members of Detroit's secondary, including stud safety Brian Branch and cornerback Terrion Arnold, are not expected to play due to suspension or injury. Another defensive back, Kerby Joseph, is also banged up. It's a fortunate break for the Buccaneers, who figure to have Mike Evans back but won't have Emeka Egbuka after the rookie hurt his hamstring last week. Rookie Tez Johnson had an 84% route rate last week and figures to remain on the field to take advantage of the depleted defense. Veteran Sterling Shepard will probably man the slot more than anyone else. I wouldn't be surprised if all three, along with other pass-catchers (Cade Otton, Kameron Johnson), play a lot and the Bucs use a lot of spread formations to get a bunch of Lions cornerbacks and safeties on the field. Though the Lions pass rush is one of the most aggressive in the league (37% pass rush pressure rate and 19 sacks in their past five games), Baker Mayfield should have the chance at a very good game because of the downfield matchups his receivers should have. MUST-STARTS : Amon-Ra St. Brown , Jahmyr Gibbs STARTS : Jared Goff , Baker Mayfield , Rachaad White , Mike Evans , Sam LaPorta FLEX : Jameson Williams , David Montgomery (non-PPR) SITS : Tez Johnson (desperation WR), Sterling Shepard (desperation WR), Cade Otton (desperation TE), Sean Tucker , Lions DST, Buccaneers DST The Seahawks will win or lose on the arm of Sam Darnold this week. That's because Houston's run defense has allowed just 3.3 yards per carry in its past three games, with just three explosive runs allowed all season (no run longer than 21 yards!). Between the matchup and the workload split between Kenneth Walker III and Zach Charbonnet, it's tough to expect a big game from either. The Texans tend to play a lot of zone coverage and don't blitz much, yet still get good pass rush pressure from game to game. Darnold has been at his worst when pressured in 2025, seeing a nearly 30-percentage-point drop in completion rate and a 3.1-yard per attempt drop in efficiency when the heat's on. At least his offensive line has evolved into a better-than-average group in terms of pass rush pressure rate allowed, and Darnold deserves the benefit of the doubt based on how he's fared in road games at Pittsburgh and Jacksonville, as well as in his past home game against an equally aggressive Bucs defense. MUST-STARTS : Jaxon Smith-Njigba , Nico Collins STARTS : Sam Darnold (low-end starter), C.J. Stroud (borderline starter), Kenneth Walker III (low-end No. 2 RB), Seahawks DST, Texans DST FLEX : Woody Marks SITS : Trevor Lawrence, Zach Charbonnet , Cooper Kupp (desperation PPR flex), Tory Horton (desperation flex), A.J.

f7740d05bab0,"Keegan Murray contract: Kings forward agrees to five-year, $140 million rookie extension, per report",,"Getty Images The Sacramento Kings have reportedly signed forward Keegan Murray to a five-year, $140 million rookie extension, per ESPN's Shams Charania . The fourth overall pick in the 2022 NBA Draft was set to become a restricted free agent next summer, but this new deal locks him in with Sacramento through the 2030-31 season. The hope is that Murray can return to the version of himself that averaged 15.2 points on 35.8% from 3-point range in his sophomore season. He looked like a solid 3-and-D threat that season, but his numbers took a dive last season (12.4 points, 34.3% from deep), in part due to all of the changes around him on the roster with the additions of DeMar DeRozan and Zach LaVine , and the departure of De'Aaron Fox . There was also the firing of Mike Brown and promoting Doug Christie to the lead position, which certainly contributed to Murray's third-year slump. But with a full offseason with this roster and coaching staff, Murray could certainly return to form. Unfortunately, though, he'll be starting the season on the injured list after suffering a torn ligament in his thumb which will keep him sidelined for 4-6 weeks . That's a massive loss out the gate for the Kings. But in the long-term, locking Murray into an extension is a win for a franchise that has seemed directionless over recent years. Kings remain directionless with Russell Westbrook signing: How Sacramento can escape pit of mediocrity Cameron Salerno Murray's extension comes on the heels of the team signing veteran guard Russell Westbrook to a deal on Wednesday, adding him to an already overcrowded backcourt. It's unclear how Westbrook will fit on this roster, or what minutes he'll get given the team already employs Dennis Schröder, Malik Monk and Keon Ellis . But that's small potatoes when you consider all the bad moves the Kings have made over the years (like trading Tyrese Haliburton ). Signing Murray to an extension was the smart move. Either the Kings can see how Murray continues to develop, or he becomes a valuable trade chip for a contending team looking for size on the perimeter who is a career 37.2% 3-point shooter. Murray holds the Kings record for most 3s made in a single game (12), according CBS Sports research. He also broke the NBA rookie record for most 3-pointers in a season (206) and is one of just three players to post at least 500 3-pointers, 150 blocks and 150 steals over the last three seasons. The other two players in that category are Anthony Edwards and Derrick White , pretty good company to be in for the fourth-year forward.",https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/keegan-murray-contract-kings-forward-agrees-to-five-year-140-million-rookie-extension-per-report,Sport,cbssports.com,,https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2025/10/16/eb6250b2-8452-4e80-864a-d5e286c221ba/thumbnail/1200x675/04daf9991b0c4f3be1c8fbc105e3f402/keegan-murray.jpg,2025-10-16T00:21:28+00:00,d1f1443d53c08ee27b17dbd4cb1d730fe04a5e74
66febc8bbed1,Kaulig Racing fires spotter for Ty Dillon after playoff-altering accident involving William Byron,,"NASCAR spotter Joe White shared Wednesday that he has been fired following a major accident involving Ty Dillon, the driver for whom he spotted, and Cup Series playoff contender William Byron late in Sunday's race at Las Vegas Motor Speedway. White worked for Kaulig Racing as the spotter for their No. 10 Cup Series team as well as their No. 11 Xfinity Series team. With 31 laps to go in Sunday's opening race of the Round of 8 at Las Vegas, Dillon -- who had been running laps down with a car that he had been struggling with -- was called to pit road for a green flag stop just after the leaders finished their cycle of stops. Normally, there is an expectation for a team coming to pit road to alert traffic behind them that they are slowing down to come to pit road, whether it be by the spotter alerting the spotter for the car running behind them or by the driver delivering a hand signal to traffic behind them. This is especially true in cases where a lap down car is coming to pit road in front of lead lap cars. Dillon was called to pit road just after being put a lap down by race leader Kyle Larson, and he began to slow in Turns 3 & 4 in order to make the entry to pit road a short distance ahead of William Byron, who just lost the lead and remained second. But apparently, Byron's team had not received a message from Dillon's team that they were going to pit: Byron had only been informed to expect Dillon to run in either the second or third lane, leaving him completely unaware that the No. 10 in front of him was coming to pit road. The result was a violent collision that took both Dillon and Byron out of the race, and one which has severely hampered Byron's championship hopes. Prior to the crash, Byron had possessed a 23 point advantage over the cut line to make the Championship 4, and still had a chance of earning a spot in the final round outright by winning. Instead, and despite having led 55 laps, Byron left Las Vegas with a 36th place finish that has left him 15 points below the cut line. Byron will now have to either overcome his points deficit or win at either Talladega or Martinsville to advance to the final round of the playoffs and have a chance to win the Cup Series championship in the season finale at Phoenix. ""I never saw him wave.

aa12f08b9118,Woman Dies in Apparent Suicide at Disney World’s Contemporary Resort,,"A woman died in an “apparent suicide” on Tuesday outside Disney World ‘s Contemporary Resort in Florida, according to the Orange County Sheriff’s Office. “We can confirm this was an apparent suicide,” a spokesperson for the Orange County Sheriff’s Office told Variety in an email. The suicide’s proximity to the famous Disney World monorail sparked unconfirmed reports online about the cause of death. However, a spokesperson from the Orange County Sheriff’s Office told People that the victim was “NOT struck by the monorail,” and deemed any reports suggesting she was “erroneous information.” Local outlet WKMG reported that local authorities received word around 6:40 p.m. local time about a body on North World Dive, which runs through Disney’s Contemporary Resort. A video by an onlooker posted online showed employees erecting a white pop-up tent on the terrace of the Contemporary Resort in the wake of the incident. Police cars can be seen congregating in the parking lot below. Originally opened in October 1971 as the Tempo Bay Hotel, the Contemporary Resort is one of the two original residences built at the Disney World Complex. On the Disney World website , the hotel is described as an “ultra-modern” lodging featuring the “iconic A-frame Contemporary tower” and a “90-foot-tall mural by Disney Legend Mary Blair — responsible for the distinct look and feel of the ‘it’s a small world’ attraction.” The suicide comes a week after a woman in her 60s experienced a health issue and died after riding Disneyland’s Haunted Mansion attraction in California. Anaheim Police confirmed that the woman was unresponsive after exiting the ride, and that Disneyland security administered CPR until first responders rushed her to the hospital. She was later pronounced dead.",https://variety.com/2025/film/news/suicide-disney-world-contemporary-resort-1236554219,Entertainment,variety.com,Jack Dunn,https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Disney-World-Contemporary-Resport.jpg?crop=0px%2C157px%2C1500px%2C843px&resize=1000%2C563,2025-10-16T00:38:43+00:00,ee1c8b679b60a751f84cbbaf4b19788631ee391b

Several recent “ Survivor ” contestants — including Teeny Chirichillo (Season 47), Yam Yam Arocho (Season 44) and Katurah Topps (Season 45) — have returned to tribal council to advocate for Zohran Mamdani in a new campaign advertisement paid for by the New York City mayoral candidate. The spot, which aired locally on WCBS-TV in New York during Wednesday night’s episode of “Survivor,” is one of several in a seven-figure ad buy to reach different demographics of the voting public. Mamdani’s campaign ran a “Bachelor”-inspired ad during a recent episode of “The Golden Bachelor.” “Andrew, New Yorkers want a mayor who will make groceries and childcare affordable, not sell us out to their billionaire donors,” Chirichillo says in the ad while holding up a piece of the show’s signature voting parchment with Cuomo’s name on it, as if voting him out of the race. In a spin on the confessionals shown during “Survivor” elimination ceremonies, Brandon Donlon (Season 45) pushes for “a mayor who will make buses fast and free,” while Arocho hopes to elect someone who will “not defund the MTA.” Before Cuomo’s fictional torch is snuffed out, Natalie Anderson (Season 29) makes a final plea: “We’re with assemblyman Zohran Mamdani. He’ll stand up to Trump, freeze the rent and deliver universal childcare.” Mamdani appears at the end of the spot to conclude: “We’re going to build a city where no one has to struggle to survive.” WCBS ran a disclaimer before the ad to make sure this wasn’t seen as an endorsement by the brand: “The Following Message Is Not Associated with Either ‘Survivor’ or CBS.” It’s understood that CBS and the “Survivor” producers weren’t consulted about the use of the “Survivor” concept or appearance by previous contestants. “Federal law required our New York station WCBS-TV to run this candidate ad despite there not being any relationship to either ‘Survivor’ or WCBS-TV,” a CBS spokesperson said in a statement. Mamdani, a 33-year-old Democratic Socialist and state assemblyman whose progressive economic platform has galvanized younger voters, won the Democratic primary in a stunning upset. He and his rivals — former Gov. Cuomo, running as an independent, and Curtis Sliwa, the Republican nominee — are expected to spend millions of advertising dollars ahead of the mayoral election on Nov. 4.",https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/zohran-mamdani-survivor-campaign-ad-vote-cuomo-off-island-1236553778,Entertainment,variety.com,Rebecca Rubin,https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/survivor-mamdani-ad.jpg?w=1000&h=563&crop=1,2025-10-16T00:30:00+00:00,bc42e7153f2afe2171e92d42bbe690ddc401c021

The Lakers announced Oct. 9 that James would be out 3-4 weeks, but Charania noted that James, 40, will take a ""patient approach"" with his rehabilitation process. Reports surfaced earlier this month that James was dealing with nerve irritation in his glute and would likely miss the entire NBA preseason . It was reported that James was ramping up his workload to prepare for the Lakers' season opener against the Golden State Warriors on Oct. 21. However, his timeline to return has been pushed back, meaning he will miss his team's first game of the season for the first time in his 23-year career.

c4ff838d1eee,‘South Park’ Abruptly Starts Season 28 With Viral ‘6-7’ TikTok Trend and Peter Thiel Hunting Down Trump’s Antichrist Baby,,"After a three-week wait, “ South Park ” is back with a new episode and a new season. In an abrupt turn of events, the short-lived Season 27 has ended after just five episodes, instead of the previously determined 10, a spokesperson for Comedy Central confirmed. No details were provided as to why. Wednesday’s Season 28 premiere saw South Park Elementary enveloped in the “6-7” TikTok trend, and Palantir co-founder Peter Thiel thinks the Antichrist is to blame. The episode opens on a rally led by PC Principal, who is determined to get South Park Elementary back on track after catching wind of some “santaic numerology shit” going on.” To set things straight, he brings in a guest speaker to talk some sense into the student body: The “absolute expert on the end of days and the coming of the Antichrist,” Peter Thiel. “Hello, kids, I’m Peter Thiel, and I’m here to talk to you about the Antichrist,” he says. “Ok, so first, what is the Antichrist? The Antichrist is a newer, more human form of Satan that will soon walk the Earth. We don’t know how soon it will walk the Earth, but it could be within the next six to seven weeks.” The South Park Elementary student body then explodes in unison, “6-7!” Confused, Thiel continues his impromptu TED Talk. He explains that Satan wasn’t able to have a child until Donald Trump came along, who has the perfect-sized manhood to fit inside Satan’s “pinhole” sized rectum. How big is Trump’s manhood? Thiel estimates it’s between “six and seven centimeters.” Once again, his Gen Alpha audience shouts, “6-7!” Now frustrated, Thiel yells back at the kids, “The Antichrist is coming! The Bible refers to the eagle, which refers to America, the fourth seal broken, and hell coming to Earth. It’s right here in Revelations Six… Six-Seven.” Dead set on putting an end to the seemingly demonic “6-7” craze, Thiel dives into the school data center with PC Principal and South Park Elementary’s counselor, Jesus Christ, to look for answers. “I’ve downloaded all the students’ information and loaded them into an AI face detection program so the school’s security cameras can watch their every move,” he says. “Now look. Two students passing each other in the hallway. They give each other the sign: six, seven. Exactly 67 seconds later, this odd parka-wearing child makes the same gesture. And then inside the girls’ bathroom, two girls doing the same thing!” A concerned Jesus stops him, “Wait, why is there a camera inside the girls’ bathroom?” Thiel returns, “To stop the Antichrist!” All the while, Thiel has been secretly working for JD Vance, who is determined to stop the Antichrist from being born so that he can take Trump’s place instead of the devil child. He tells Vance, while en route to a child he suspects is connected to the demon spawn, “I’m very close to finding the secret of the numbers. I’ve narrowed it down to one little boy who seems more possessed than the others.” The child in question: Eric Cartman. Ala “The Exorcist,” Thiel walks up to Cartman’s room to free him from the possession. Thiel tells a giggling Cartman, “I came to see you in an Uber. You know how long it took me to get here? Around six or seven minutes.” Cartman starts laughing so hard that he projectile vomits all over Thiel. Unable to complete the exorcism, he tells Ms.Cartman that he must take her child to D.C., and that “everything we hold dear could end” if he doesn’t “unlock the secrets he holds.” “6-7” (pronounced “six seven”) is a viral lyric from the rap single “Doot Doot (6 7)” from American artist Skrilla. The phrase skyrocketed into the cultural zeitgeist through TikTok, proving especially popular with younger users. As demonstrated by “South Park,” “6-7” is often recited in tadum with a hand gesture popularized by a TikTok user named Maverick Trevillain, fittingly known as “The 67 Kid.” The phrase doesn’t appear to have any real meaning and functions more as an internet inside joke. Thiel recently made headlines after the Washington Post published the contents of his invite-only, off-record lectures on religion and the tech industry. Across the four, roughly two-hour-long talks, the venture capitalist accused Greta Thunberg as well as all those who are critical of the rapid development of artificial intelligence of being “legionnaires of the Antichrist.”",https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/south-park-season-28-tiktok-peter-thiel-antichrist-trump-1236554275,Entertainment,variety.com,Jack Dunn,https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/MixCollage-15-Oct-2025-08-32-PM-3709.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1200px%2C675px&resize=1000%2C563,2025-10-16T04:02:40+00:00,291e2877bfca75ec52d32392fb61f30c1c638548
48f237b6c6e7,"Kevin Federline Speaks Out on Britney Spears’ Alleged Drug Use and Erratic Behavior, Opposes End of Her Conservatorship: 7 Biggest Revelations From New Memoir",,"With his debut memoir “You Thought You Knew,” Kevin Federline is telling his side of the story. The 47-year-old first came to public prominence as Britney Spears ‘ second husband after they married in 2004, plucked from his rising career as a dancer and thrust into a chaotic world of paparazzi and superstardom. But things soon turned acrimonious following the birth of their two sons, Preston and Jayden, leading to years of infighting over custody out of concern for Spears’ mental health and his ridicule as a public figure. Federline outlines much of his experiences with Spears in “You Thought You Knew,” out Oct. 21, while shedding light on his personal trajectory. From the start, the Fresno native reflects on his burgeoning dance career on tour with LFO and Pink amid his relationship with Shar Jackson, with whom he has two children. But much of his story focuses on Spears and their tumultuous romance, from the whirlwind of attention to their inevitably contentious dynamic. Through it all, he reiterates his devotion to being a father to his six children, stating that he only cares to protect them from the ills of the world. In a statement to Variety , a rep for Spears says, “With news from Kevin’s book breaking, once again he and others are profiting off her and sadly it comes after child support has ended with Kevin. All she cares about are her kids, Sean Preston and Jayden James and their well-being during this sensationalism. She detailed her journey in her memoir.” Now living in Hawaii with his wife Victoria Prince, Federline traces the shocking moments from his life in “You Thought You Knew,” divulging how it all unfolded. Federline Was Thrown Into the Deep End After meeting Spears at Hollywood club Joseph’s and sparking their romance, Federline was brought into her circle, as she demanded that her team include him on her European tour. Her security warned him to “be careful” and that he was “on a sinking ship,” which he said was “the first real warning,” but it was a night in Amsterdam that ultimately changed his perspective. They returned to their hotel room after a night of partying when Spears said she’d be right back. Federline later found her making out with a dancer named Theresa and swiftly packed to leave the tour, only to change his mind after she apologized. Still, he recalled, “that moment was a turning point for both of us,” one where she realized that he wasn’t there for the “fame or perks.” Spears Had ‘Unfinished Business’ With Justin Timberlake The night before Federline married Spears in 2004, he recalls that she had a phone call with her ex-boyfriend Justin Timberlake outside of where they were staying in Santa Monica. He said he could “tell Britney still had some unfinished business” with Timberlake, and that she had been crying. She explained that she needed to call Timberlake “to end one chapter of her life before starting a new one” and wanted closure. But “even after the wedding, I could tell she hadn’t fully moved on,” he writes. “Looking back, especially after hearing what she said in her book, I realize it was deeper than that. She never really got over him. She might’ve loved me, but there was always something there with Justin that she couldn’t let go of.” He Learned of Their Divorce Through an Interview Federline claims throughout his memoir that he had several breaking points during his relationship with Spears, but points specifically to one evening where he knew “this was the beginning of the end” for their marriage. In 2006, Federline was celebrating the release of his debut album with a party at Los Angeles’ Paramount Studios on Halloween. Spears initially said that she would not be attending, but inevitably did show up along with her brother Brian, father Jamie, agent Jason Trawick and an unnamed actress. Federline walked in on her in his dressing room doing cocaine with the actress, something that he’d seen her do before, but was shocked to witness as she was breastfeeding at the time. Federline confronted her about using cocaine, telling her, “Please don’t go home and breastfeed the kids like this. Call your mom or someone. We need to get formula. You can’t do this.” Spears then threw a drink in his face and stormed off, while Federline called her mother and insisted that she not let Spears breastfeed at her home. The next morning, Federline called his lawyer Mark Kaplan to draft a legal letter demanding that Spears stop breastfeeding their children, and Federline left town to promote his record, ignoring her calls and messages. While he was in Toronto for an interview at MuchMusic, a producer asked him just before he went on air, “How do you feel about Britney filing for divorce?” — the first he’d heard of their split. He Details Spears’ Erratic Behavior Towards Their Children Federline spends much of “You Thought You Knew” insisting that his main priority has always been protecting his children and providing them with a safe life. But he writes of several instances where he claims Spears acted abusively and erratically around their two children. In perhaps the most shocking moment in the book, he describes how their sons Preston and Jayden awoke several nights to Spears standing in the doorway watching them sleep with a knife in her hand. “Oh, you’re awake?” she said, only to “turn around and pad off without explanation.” The book also details several other incidents that his children relayed to him, including one where Preston claimed that Spears punched him in the face. Federline states that Spears bleached their hair down to the scalp, leaving them with burns, and that Preston once asked him when he was 10 or 11 why Spears kept forcing him to bathe with her. The boys recorded some incidents with Spears on their phones, including times that she verbally berated them and once woke up Jayden at midnight to put lotion on his face on a school night. He says that Spears also gave Jayden shellfish, knowing that he was allergic to it. In what Federline describes as another breaking point, Preston went to Europe with his girlfriend’s family on vacation where he received a call from Spears, blaming Federline for everything. After Preston confronted her and called her out, Federline recalls, “Her response was chilling: she told him she wished he, his brother, and me were all dead.” He Reflects on Spears’ Infamous Paparazzi Moments In her memoir “The Woman in Me,” Spears explains that her split from Federline and severe postpartum depression led to her infamous episode where she shaved her head and attacked a paparazzo’s car. Federline reflects on that period in “You Thought You Knew,” describing the time that Spears locked herself in a bathroom with Jayden and claimed that Jayden was being abused at Federline’s house. After a standoff that lasted for hours, Spears was removed in a straitjacket and placed in a 5150 hold as their children were inspected by doctors due to her “outlandish claims.” “I felt sick over what she was going through,” he states. “This was someone I had loved.” Federline Couldn’t Get Behind the Free Britney Movement After Spears was put in a conservatorship, Federline says that he “supported the decision because I believed it was the only way to stabilize her situation, and more importantly, provide a safer environment for our kids.” He turns his attention to the Free Britney movement, which rallied for her freedom from the conservatorship. “I tried to understand where they were coming from, but I could never fully get behind it,” he writes. “At times, it felt more like a fandom’s mob mentality than genuine concern for Britney’s well-being.” He theorizes that the judge who terminated the conservatorship in 2021 felt “pressure” from the Free Britney movement, which “led the judge to ignore professional reports and cave to public opinion, especially with her own election on the line.” When the conservatorship ended, he “braced for the worst.” “The Free Britney movement got it wrong,” he says. “All of those people who put so much effort into that should now put the same energy into the Save Britney movement. Because this is no longer about freedom. It’s about survival.” He’s Concerned for Spears’ Well-Being Though Federline has not spoken with Spears in years, he says that he feels “an increasing urgency that I can’t ignore” and that her situation is “racing toward something irreversible.” “The signs are all there: the erratic behavior, the isolation, the cycling of people around her, the refusal to accept help. It’s become impossible to pretend everything’s okay,” he writes. “From where I sit, the clock is ticking, and we’re getting close to the eleventh hour. Something bad is going to happen if things don’t change, and my biggest fear is that our sons will be left holding pieces. They love their mom. They’ve seen the red flags. But they don’t know how to help without being attacked, misunderstood, or blamed.”",https://variety.com/2025/music/news/kevin-federline-memoir-britney-spears-drugs-conservatorship-1236554156,Entertainment,variety.com,Steven J.

Speaking to Variety , Deol says the fan response remains extraordinary. “It’s kind of overwhelming when you get so much love and keep getting more and more love from the audiences. Thirty years, what better way to celebrate with especially with your fans, and to have such a big, successful web series: ‘ The Ba***ds of Bollywood.’ ” The actor credits streaming platforms with fundamentally altering his career trajectory. “It all changed with OTT platforms for me, because that gave me my first chance to do something different,” he says. His Netflix film “Class of 83” (2020), a gritty police drama set in 1980s Mumbai, marked the beginning — but it was the Amazon MX Player series “Aashram,” in which he played a sinister godman, that truly changed perceptions. “It released one week later, and it just overshadowed ‘Class of 83’ completely. I still, till date, whenever I meet Prakash Ji [director Prakash Jha], I can’t come to terms with it, but it took me a long time to come to terms with the fact that what did he see in me to cast me as Baba Nirala.” That role signaled to the industry that he was capable of far more than his initial career suggested. “That was the beginning of everything, because people started having belief and faith in me as an actor that, OK, Bobby doesn’t just have to be how I was in my beginning of my career. He can play different characters,” he says. Deol’s performance as a mute antagonist in Sandeep Reddy Vanga’s violent crime saga “ Animal ” (2023) proved pivotal to his resurgence and led directly to his collaboration with Anurag Kashyap on “Bandar” (Monkey in a Cage) , a raw prison drama that premiered at the Toronto Film Festival in September. After “Animal’s” release, Kashyap called Deol and spoke to him for 45 minutes, expressing admiration for his evolution as an actor. The validation from a filmmaker he’d long admired left Deol both thrilled and anxious. “Bandar” ( Monkey in a Cage ) Saffron Magicworks Private Limited “I’d been wanting to work with Anurag since years,” Deol says, recalling their various encounters over the decades, from when Kashyap was still a writer visiting his home, to running into each other at their children’s martial arts events and at the gym. “As a director, I’ve always loved his work, and he always gets something different out of every actor he works with.” The night before his first day of shooting on “Bandar,” sleep eluded him. “I’m like wondering to myself, ‘What have I done that has made Anurag want to work with me?'” At 3 a.m., he put on Netflix and watched “Animal” again, trying to understand what others saw in his performance. “I still couldn’t figure it out, because obviously, as actors, you can’t figure out certain times when things change in your life and what you’ve been waiting for — that moment — happens. It’s like, surreal. It’s like a dream.” After only an hour of sleep, Deol headed to set, where the experience proved transformative. “Working with Anurag was like being in a workshop. I always give myself completely to my director, and working with Anurag was like going to this acting coach, being with him and giving yourself up — no inhibitions, nothing. Just give yourself completely.” Kashyap’s communication style made that vulnerability possible. “I think that’s because of the way he communicates with his actors. And I guess that’s the reason why people enjoyed my work in the film, because for me, it was totally out of my image, my everything.” The process allowed him to learn more about himself. “Every time you’re working on a project, you kind of start understanding different aspects of your emotions,” he says. The film was completed in just 23 days. “Bandar” marked Deol’s first festival premiere at Toronto’s 50th anniversary, where he also represented his father for the festival’s golden jubilee celebration of “Sholay,” one of the greatest Indian films of all time. “I never imagined going to a film festival. I mean, never thought that a movie of mine will be premiered at a festival,” he says. “And what better way to celebrate — it was the 50th year of TIFF, and I also got the opportunity to represent my father for ‘Sholay’s 50 years. It was like being in India.” Deol’s decision to join Bollywood superstar Shah Rukh Khan’s son Aryan Khan’s directorial debut — the Netflix series “ The Ba***ds of Bollywood ,” a behind-the-scenes drama exploring the underbelly of the Hindi-language film industry — stemmed from industry solidarity and parental empathy. “I’m a parent myself, and I’m from this industry, and I’d want anyone to be there to stand by me when my sons are getting into this industry,” he says. “I know that Shah Rukh is that kind of a person who would stand by me, or so many people I know in my industry, and I just felt that positive feeling and that emotion and when I got the call, I just said that I’m doing it.” “The Ba***ds of Bollywood” Netflix What began as support became something more substantial after a long meeting with Aryan Khan. “I sat with him for seven hours and heard the whole story because it’s seven episodes, and I just was taken in by his conviction, by his writing, by his thoughts, by his maturity,” he says. “Every time you talk to a director, I always believe you get scripts to read. But when you sit with them and you hear it from them narrating to you, you get a better idea of what they’re visualizing. So I think I just got lucky.” Deol praises Khan’s approach to the material. “The show, whatever it is, it’s all because of Aryan. I think that child has done a great job. So mature, his conviction, his instincts, his fearlessness, and to give something which is so different yet so connecting. It’s about things you’ve seen, but at the same time it is so differently approached.” The series’ success, he argues, stems from its comprehensive storytelling. “I think every character in the show is something you’ll remember, not just one person. That happens very rarely. It only when the writing is good and when the direction is good that every actor tries to work hard. But it can only be seen if the captain of the ship can bring it out.” The series explores Bollywood myths and realities in a very insider way. “I think it’s just making fun of yourself in a way, it’s just being absolutely open,” he says. “It’s a fiction, end of the day. So how do you entertain people? You bring out elements, you show elements, so people discuss them and get excited about it. As it is, ‘The Ba***ds of Bollywood’ is a show based on all the myths of the Bollywood industry. Because stories can’t be written if there’s no truth behind it. But most of the stories which are created for cinema or for OTT platforms, they have to be fictionalized, because you got to make it more juicier and more interesting.” Asked whether being born into the industry but experiencing career setbacks gives him unique insight into how Bollywood treats talent, Deol offers a measured perspective. “I think it works for any kind of industry, for any profession. Being an insider was my luck, because I was born in this family. I never asked to be born in this house.” His father, he notes, was an outsider who struggled for years before his first break. “Definitely being an insider, I have experienced ups and downs, and I’ve learned from that. So yes, I’m lucky to be Dharmendra’s son, and I’m just so proud about that,” he says. “But at the same time, it’s not easy for anybody. You can be an insider, an outsider. You have to work hard. The only thing that any parent would do for the child is spend their own money to launch you. They have worked so hard that they want the kids to live a very happy life, so they would spend every penny to make things for them. But after that, you have to make every penny worth it with your hard work.” His journey from a strong start through difficult years to his current resurgence carries particular meaning because his aging parents have witnessed it. “I’m happy that I went through a great start and a bad middle, and now again, I have succeeded to a certain level. And I’m so proud that my parents have seen that, because my parents are growing old, and I wanted that to happen for them,” he says. “I’ve always felt that I could never live up to my dad’s expectations. I was always this little Bob, the youngest in the house, his golden child, because you end up being the youngest and you end up getting all that affection,” he adds. The turning point came with his father’s validation. “The biggest compliment I ever got was from my father, like four, five years back, saying that ‘now you’ve understood yourself as an actor’ and ‘I’m very proud of you.’ I think that made me feel very happy, because that’s what I wanted to hear, and I’m really proud of that.” Having lived through single-screen theaters, the multiplex wave, and now streaming, Deol remains format-agnostic. “I never think about which medium I’m going to be part of in that sense. For me, things have evolved because times are changing. You have to move with the times. So you have to do things according to how the times are moving. Because to exist, you have to be in sync with what’s happening.” Still, he waxes nostalgic about the communal experience of single-screen cinemas. “The magic of single screen is something else. I’ve grown up watching movies in single screens, and I’ve seen people going crazy. The atmosphere in a single screen is completely something you really, really become a part of when you’re sitting there in the theater.” Nevertheless, he embraces evolution. “But then multiplex, it had to come, the time had to evolve, and then OTT platforms. I really am happy that OTT platforms exist, because it changed my life. And I think all of them can coexist. It’s just how the creators, they have to be honest with their work and try to do their best.” Deol also expresses nostalgia for earlier eras of filmmaking. “I always say that I wish I was born in the 30s so I could have been an actor in the 50s and enjoy the golden period and be a part of everything that was done for the first time, because there was so much honesty and sincerity and passion.” Though he hasn’t experienced it himself, he’s heard stories from his father about the kind of filmmakers and the honesty that pervaded that era. Today’s landscape is different. “But now people have changed. They’ve evolved. Everyone’s living a tough life because it is becoming tougher out there. So there’s no time to get entertained besides seeing things on your mobile phone or your laptop or sitting somewhere, waiting in a lounge. But I’m just glad that these 30 years I’ve actually had a great time and I’m just happy, and I’m so lucky that I’m doing what I love the most still.” Looking ahead, Deol has “Alpha” releasing Dec. 25, the latest installment in producer Aditya Chopra’s YRF Spy Universe, directed by Shiv Rawail, son of Rahul Rawail who directed his brother Sunny Deol’s first film “Betaab” (1983). “Rahul directed my brother’s first film. And now Shiv, his son is directing his first film, and I’m a part of it, so it makes it special.” While he occasionally contemplates directing, Deol admits it’s not his calling. “I think I wish I could direct. Sometimes, every actor thinks they want to direct, because as an actor, you start imagining and thinking how the story moves and how that character would react, and how that person would do things. But I’m not someone who can control people. I can’t multitask. So I wish I was a director, but I can’t be one.” His focus now is on continuing to push boundaries. “I am just glad that my audiences have helped me. The love they’ve given me is giving me the opportunities now to do work which is out of my comfort zone, and just keep surprising myself and surprising the audiences with what I can do. That’s what I’m hoping for.”",https://variety.com/2025/film/news/bobby-deol-career-resurgence-aryan-khan-1236553504,Entertainment,variety.com,Naman Ramachandran,https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Bobby-Deol.jpg?w=1000&h=563&crop=1,2025-10-16T05:30:00+00:00,c92bc89baec6c79acc6266677cc403035f1dec23

Something bad is going to happen if things don’t change, and my biggest fear is that our sons will be left holding the pieces.” Now, Spears is telling her side of the story. In a post to Instagram on Wednesday, the Grammy winner wrote, “The constant gaslighting from [my] ex-husband is extremely hurtful and exhausting. I have always pleaded and screamed to have a life with my boys. Relationships with teenage boys is complex. I have felt demoralized by this situation and have always asked and almost begged for them to be a part of my life. Sadly, they have always witnessed the lack of respect shown by [their] own father for me. They need to take responsibility for themselves. With one son only seeing me for 45 min in the past 5 years and the other with only 4 visits in the past 5 years. I have pride too. From now on I will let them know when I am available.” She added, directly attacking Federline’s book, “Trust me, those white lies in that book, they are going straight to the bank and I am the only one who genuinely gets hurt here. I will always love them and if you really know me, you won’t pay attention to the tabloids of my mental health and drinking. I am actually a pretty intelligent woman who has been trying to live a sacred and private life the past 5 years. I speak on this because I have had enough and any real woman would do the same.” Federline and Spears were married in 2004, and Spears filed for divorce two years later in 2006.

It is the latest wave of violence to have engulfed the South American nation in recent years. The government of President Daniel Noboa has been struggling to beat back criminal groups, who have shifted their drug smuggling from more militarised countries like Colombia to historically peaceful Ecuador. Recommended Stories list of 3 items end of list Explosives were placed on bridges “to block traffic”, Transport Minister Roberto Luque wrote on X on Wednesday, describing the acts as “terrorism”. No casualties have been reported, though roads leading to the affected areas remain closed. Interior Minister John Reimberg accused Ecuadorian gang Los Lobos, which is designated as a “foreign terrorist organisation” by the United States, and former rebels of the now-defunct movement Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC, with ties to the gang, of being behind the blasts. Reimberg said the attacks came after security operations destroyed “illegal mining operations” in northern Ecuador and detained ex-FARC members. No group immediately claimed responsibility for the blasts, and no arrests have been made. The US State Department’s Bureau of Western Hemisphere Affairs condemned the attacks in a post on X, calling them “brazen terrorist attacks against the Ecuadorian people”. “We remain committed to the fight to eradicate organized crime and stand ready to support Ecuador in holding those responsible to account,” it wrote in a statement. The Associated Press news agency obtained a police report that confirmed the bridge structure in the city of Naranjal, about 290km (180 miles) southwest of the capital, Quito, sustained damage “from the suspected detonation”. Marcela Aguinaga, prefect of the Guayas province, where Naranjal is located, condemned the “criminal act” on X. The other explosion occurred on a bridge connecting the provinces of Azuay and El Oro in southern Ecuador. The emergency services reported on X that the route was closed due to a “possible collapse” of the structure. Images released by local media showed rubble, twisted metal from the bridge, and shattered windscreens on at least two buses. The bridge explosions occurred just hours after a car bomb went off outside a shopping mall in Guayaquil, Ecuador’s largest city, killing one person and injuring many. A second vehicle containing explosives was found nearby but was deactivated. The Attorney General’s Office said it had launched an investigation into the blasts, while the government offered a reward for any information leading to the identification and capture of those responsible. Noboa, speaking at a public event in Guayaquil on Wednesday, said criminal groups were attempting to destabilise the government and that the country cannot “back down before people who want to terrorise Ecuadorian families”. In March, a vehicle exploded outside Ecuador’s largest and most dangerous prison on the outskirts of Guayaquil, killing a prison guard. In 2023, Ecuador saw several more car bomb attacks as part of a wave of criminal violence that has plagued the Andean nation since early 2021.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/16/explosions-hit-ecuador-local-criminal-gang-and-ex-farc-dissidents-blamed,World,aljazeera.com,,https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/AP25288094382166-1760594479.jpg?resize=1920%2C1440,,d11ba743b967064edf6cf02b7fa00b2de9fe6ee0

The Ukrainian energy ministry has said the country’s power infrastructure has been hit with drones, knocking out electricity supplies in several areas including in the central Dnipropetrovsk region. Weapons and military Kyiv will need up to $20bn in military aid next year from NATO countries, Ukrainian Defence Minister Denys Shmyhal said. The aid will help Ukraine build 10 billion drones in 2026, according to the Reuters news agency. German Defence Minister Boris Pistorius has announced that Berlin will finance a US weapons package for Ukraine amounting to $500m, as Western allies seek to fortify Kyiv’s defences in the ongoing war with Russia. Speaking at a meeting in Brussels, Pistorius said the package includes air defence systems as well as Patriot missiles, among others. Russia’s Federal Security Service chief said that Moscow has no doubt about NATO’s security services’ involvement in incidents with alleged Russian drones over EU territory, RIA cited him as saying. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen proposed a “drone wall” after about 20 Russian drones allegedly entered the airspace of EU and NATO member Poland last month. Politics and diplomacy The US and its allies would “impose costs on Russia for its continued aggression” if the war in Ukraine does not come to an end soon, US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth declared during a meeting at the NATO headquarters. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has appointed Serhiy Lysak as the mayor of the Black Sea port city Odesa, a day after revoking the citizenship of the former mayor, Gennadiy Trukhanov , prompting his automatic dismissal. Trulkhanov allegedly holds a Russian passport, a claim that he denies. Energy and economy Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov has rejected US President Donald Trump’s warning of a collapse of the Russian economy , saying Moscow has a “sufficient and considerable margin of safety” and was strong enough to allow President Vladimir Putin to achieve his goals. EU Economy Commissioner Valdis Dombrovskis told the AFP news agency that the bloc will urge G7 partners to consider tapping immobilised Russian assets in aiding Ukraine, as finance ministers of the group meet in Washington this week. Repairs are set to begin “soon” to restore the power supply to Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant, according to Rafael Grossi, head of the UN’s nuclear watchdog IAEA. The site has been under the control of Russia since shortly after its invasion of Ukraine in 2022, and it has been cut off from the Ukraine grid since September 23. The price of crude oil has risen 1 percent following US President Donald Trump’s announcement that Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi had promised that his country would stop its purchase of oil from Russia . According to Brent crude futures, the price rose 54 cents, or 0.87 percent, to $62.45 a barrel as of 04:30 GMT on Thursday, while US West Texas Intermediate (WTI) futures climbed 57 cents, or 0.98 percent, to $58.84. As part of the US effort to put more pressure on Russia, US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent also told Japanese Finance Minister Katsunobu Kato that the Trump administration expects Japan to stop importing Russian energy. The International Monetary Fund has announced that the head of the global lending institution, Kristalina Georgieva, will be visiting Ukraine, although the exact timing is still unclear. Georgieva’s visit comes as Ukraine seeks a new loan package amid the ongoing war. Based on the current deal, Ukraine has already received $10.6bn of the $15.5bn loan from the IMF. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said in his nightly video address that he had discussed by phone with Greece’s Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis the possibility of the US supplying natural gas to Ukraine. Ukraine’s Energy Ministry has announced that it is introducing emergency power cuts in all but two regions following the recent Russian attacks on its energy infrastructure.

The 48-hour truce began Wednesday at 6:00pm Islamabad time (13:00 GMT), with each country claiming the other requested the pause in hostilities. Pakistan confirmed the ceasefire duration, stating: “During this period, both sides will sincerely strive to find a positive solution to this complex but resolvable issue through constructive dialogue.” In Kabul, the Taliban government directed its forces to respect the truce “unless it is violated” by Pakistan, according to a spokesman’s statement on X. This temporary cessation follows a week of escalating violence. The Taliban had initiated offensives along the southern Pakistani border, prompting Islamabad to threaten decisive retaliation. Pakistan has consistently accused Afghanistan of sheltering Pakistani Taliban (TTP) fighters, claims that Kabul rejects. As tensions peaked, two explosions in Kabul on Wednesday evening sent black smoke rising above the city. Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid attributed these to an oil tanker and generator explosion without linking them to the border conflict. Earlier on Wednesday, Pakistan’s military reported that Afghan Taliban fighters assaulted two major border posts in the southwest and northwest. It claimed both attacks were successfully repelled, with approximately 20 Taliban fighters killed near Spin Boldak in Afghanistan’s Kandahar province. “Unfortunately, the attack was orchestrated through divided villages in the area, with no regard for the civil population,” the Pakistani military stated. It reported about 30 additional casualties from overnight clashes along Pakistan’s northwestern border. The Taliban countered that 15 civilians died and dozens were wounded near Spin Boldak, with “two to three” of its fighters also killed. Spokesman Mujahid claimed 100 civilians were wounded and that Pakistani soldiers had been killed and weapons captured – assertions Pakistan’s military dismissed as “outrageous and blatant lies”. While Pakistan did not detail its recent casualties, it had previously confirmed 23 soldiers killed in the confrontations last week. The Taliban government claimed it launched its offensive in “retaliation for air strikes carried out by the Pakistani army on Kabul”. Islamabad pledged a robust response on Sunday, after which numerous casualties were reported on both sides. In Khost province, Afghan state television journalist Abdul Ghafoor Abid was killed Sunday by Pakistani fire while reporting on the border conflict, according to a Taliban official.",https://www.aljazeera.com/gallery/2025/10/16/afghanistan-pakistan-enter-48-hour-truce-after-deadly-border-clashes,World,aljazeera.com,,https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/AFP__20251015__78VM2CQ__v2__MidRes__TopshotAfghanistanPakistanUnrest-1760591627.jpg?resize=1200%2C630,,6b54eacf8dc1239729344719ef83803ebae5610d

Titmus confirmed her decision on Thursday, bowing out as one of Australia’s most decorated athletes with eight Olympic medals and four world titles. Recommended Stories list of 4 items end of list The decision came as a shock to her nation, and the swimming world in general, as she had long planned a return to the pool to chase more Olympic glory at the Los Angeles Games in 2028. “A tough one, a really tough one, but one that I’m really happy with,” she said of her decision in a video on social media. “I love swimming, I’ve always loved swimming. It’s been my passion since I was a little girl. “But I guess I’ve taken this time away from the pool and realised some things in my life that have always been important to me are just a little bit more important to me.” Ariarne Titmus won four gold medals, three silver and one bronze during her Olympic career [File: Petr David Josek/AP Photo] Race of the century Titmus won her third individual Olympic gold medal in a 400m freestyle final dubbed “the race of the century” at the Paris Games when she beat Ledecky and Canada’s Summer McIntosh to defend her title. After Paris, she resolved to take a year off from competing and training to recharge, electing to skip the world championships in Singapore and instead cover the meet as a TV commentator. But the return to the pool never materialised. Titmus had undergone surgery to remove benign tumours from her ovaries eight months before Paris, and she said the health issue had reminded her about having a life outside swimming. “Delving more into those health challenges, I’ve had to think about what’s most important to me,” said Titmus, who retires as the 200m freestyle world record holder. “Beyond swimming, I’ve always had goals in my personal life. “More than anything, I’m excited for what’s next.” The face of Australian swimming at the last two Olympics, Titmus’s retirement robs the national team of an inspirational leader who did much to restore the country to superpower status in the sport after a lean decade.

Earning the nickname Terminator after sweeping the 400m and 800m freestyle titles at the 2018 Commonwealth Games in Gold Coast, she then announced herself to the swimming world by beating Ledecky in the 400m freestyle at the 2019 World Championships. Two years later, her swim to reel in Ledecky and snatch her 400m freestyle crown at the Tokyo Games became instant swimming folklore, along with Boxall’s manic celebrations in the stands. The successful defence of her title in Paris made her the first Australian woman to go back-to-back in an individual swimming event since Dawn Fraser in the 1960s. Titmus also bagged two silvers and a relay gold at Paris, including her runner-up finish behind Ledecky in a thrilling 800m freestyle final. She always said Ledecky, the “GOAT” of women’s swimming, made her a better rival, but as intense as the rivalry was, there was only mutual admiration, hugs and kind words outside the pool.

Published On 16 Oct 2025 16 Oct 2025 Click here to share on social media share2 Share Dozens of news outlets have lost access to the Pentagon after they refused to sign a new set of guidelines that sharply restrict their ability to report on the United States military. The Pentagon had set a deadline of Wednesday afternoon in the US for reporters to agree to a new 21-page set of rules in order to obtain press credentials and access to the Pentagon’s premises. Recommended Stories list of 4 items end of list More than 30 outlets declined to cooperate, including The Associated Press, Bloomberg, Politico, The Atlantic, The Guardian, The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal, The Washington Post, Reuters, CNN, and more. Conservative news outlets like Fox News and Newsmax – both favoured by US President Donald Trump – also declined to sign the rules. The Pentagon Press Association, which represents more than 100 news outlets, said in a statement Tuesday that the Department of Defense had started confiscating media badges “from virtually every news organisation in America”. “It did this because reporters would not sign onto a new media policy over its implicit threat of criminalising national security reporting and exposing those who sign it to potential prosecution,” the press group said. Media outlets have announced they will continue to report on the Pentagon, albeit without direct access to the building and news briefings. The Pentagon’s new rules restrict the ability of reporters to move around the building, engage with staff, and “solicit information” from sources, according to a Pentagon memo posted online by The New York Times. They also try to restrict the media’s ability to publish classified and even some kinds of unclassified information, although this right is protected by a 1971 Supreme Court ruling. The case, New York Times v United States, protected the rights of The New York Times and The Washington Post to publish the Pentagon Papers at the height of the Vietnam War. Previous guidelines from the Pentagon fit on a single page. They primarily concerned protocols for entering the Pentagon premises and storing personal property, according to another document shared by The New York Times.

They were met with immediate criticism because they appeared to make journalists legally liable for reporting on the Pentagon. A revised version of the rules toned down some of the language, but media outlets say they still violate their constitutional rights to freedom of speech and freedom of the press. The Pentagon played down media concerns in a statement on Monday. “The policy does not ask for them to agree, just to acknowledge that they understand what our policy is. This has caused reporters to have a full-blown meltdown, crying victim online. We stand by our policy because it’s what’s best for our troops and the national security of this country,” said Chief Pentagon Spokesman Sean Parnell.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/16/us-media-return-pentagon-passes-giving-up-access-after-new-rules-kick-in,World,aljazeera.com,Erin Hale,https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/AP25288762937800-1760588639.jpg?resize=1920%2C1440,,df8d7d7fa9171582a7578d72a6cd0bd536f8190d

BHM Films produced the neo-noir pic in partnership with Yūgen Studios and Lollipop. Buffalo 8 has unveiled a trailer. The film centers on a pair of detectives hunting a serial murderer in Rawalpindi, Pakistan . Muhammad Arsalan plays the killer, with Mustafa Rizvi and Anjum Habibi starring as SI Naveed and Constable Arshad, respectively. The investigation forces both officers to confront their own moral compromises as the boundaries between justice and revenge begin to dissolve. “‘Jujji’ is not just a film – it’s a statement that Pakistani cinema can take risks and still resonate globally,” Shahzad said. “We wanted to capture the essence of Rawalpindi while making it universally human. It’s a deeply personal journey that became a collective one for our team – and we hope, for audiences everywhere.” The project took two years to develop, originating as an independent effort to spotlight Rawalpindi’s stories internationally. “Jujji” won the top prize at the Gandhara Independent Film Festival 2024 and claimed best feature at the Punjab Police Film Festival 2024. The film also screened at the Divvy Film Festival 2024. Nikki Stier Justice, Buffalo 8’s head of distribution, called the acquisition a significant pickup for the company. “From the first screening, Jujji stood out as a bold, genre-defying thriller that merges authentic South Asian storytelling with the universal appeal of true-crime cinema,” she said. “It’s the kind of film that challenges conventions while signaling the exciting global evolution of independent filmmaking.” Buffalo 8, based in Santa Monica, handles production, post-production, financing and distribution for independent films. Yūgen Studios and BHM Films develop projects across film, theater and digital platforms, with a focus on South Asian narratives and emerging filmmakers. The film launches on demand Nov. 21 in the U.S. and U.K. via Amazon and Verizon Fios/Vubiquity, with additional territories to be announced.

24cb6e918e5a,Warner Bros. Discovery and CJ ENM Form Strategic Partnership to Expand K-Content Reach,,"Warner Bros. Discovery and CJ ENM have revealed a sweeping multi-year partnership that will bring a pipeline of Korean drama and entertainment to HBO Max subscribers across Asia Pacific, marking one of the most significant collaborations between a Hollywood studio and a Korean content powerhouse. Under the deal, HBO Max will become the streaming home for Tving — the CJ ENM-affiliated Korean streaming platform — in 17 markets across Asia Pacific, including Southeast Asia, Taiwan and Hong Kong. The partnership includes the launch of a dedicated Tving branded hub on HBO Max in early 2026, featuring exclusive premieres of new original K-dramas alongside hundreds of hours of scripted and unscripted content from CJ ENM and TVING’s library. Ahead of the hub’s official launch, HBO Max will begin rolling out K-content titles starting in November, including the premiere of the highly anticipated drama “Dear X” on Nov. 6. The two companies will also co-invest and co-produce original Korean drama for global distribution on HBO Max, creating a development pipeline designed to feed the growing international appetite for Korean storytelling. “We are honored to partner with CJ ENM, a true leader in creating universally popular stories that resonate worldwide,” said David Zaslav, president and CEO of Warner Bros. Discovery. “This collaboration marks a cornerstone of our commitment to great locally relevant stories in key markets around the world.” Miky Lee, vice chair of CJ Group, added: “K-content captivates audiences everywhere with its creativity and originality. At CJ ENM, our mission has always been to connect people through the power of storytelling. This partnership with Warner Bros. Discovery takes that mission to a new level, combining Warner Bros. Discovery’s storytelling legacy with CJ’s unique voice. Together, we will deliver authentic narratives that transcend borders on a platform where fans can discover new favorites, revisit timeless classics, and experience the best in global content.” The deal represents a strategic bet on Korean content for Warner Bros. Discovery, which has been working to strengthen HBO Max’s position in competitive Asian markets. For CJ ENM, it offers a powerful distribution channel to expand the reach of its content library and its TVING platform beyond Korea. “HBO Max is the streaming destination for unique, premium storytelling so this partnership with CJ ENM, a leader in the enormously popular K-content genre, aligns perfectly with our strategy and brand,” said JB Perrette, CEO and president of global streaming and games at Warner Bros. Discovery. Tving, founded in 2020, has rapidly emerged as a leader in Korea’s streaming landscape and is currently working on a merger with Wavve, another major Korean streaming service. As of August, Tving reported 7.56 million monthly active users, representing a 4.7% increase from May. The combined reach of Tving and Wavve approaches 10 million users. The platform has built a reputation for acclaimed original series that have traveled well internationally. Tving’s “Death’s Game” ranks as one of the best K-dramas of 2024, while “Pyramid Game” was the only Korean content invited to Series Mania 2024, Europe’s largest TV series event. “Bargain” won best screenplay at the 2023 Cannes International Series Festival, becoming the first Korean streaming original series to win at the competition. “CJ ENM has spearheaded the industrialization and global expansion of K-content over the past 30 years, positioning itself as a global IP powerhouse,” said Pious Jung, CEO of CJ America and president of content, global business for CJ ENM. “Through our extensive partnership with Warner Bros. Discovery, we will strive for the sustainable growth of K-culture, which has now become a lifestyle for many across the globe.” Further details on the Tving branded hub and content lineup will be revealed in the coming months.",https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/warner-bros-discovery-cj-enm-partnership-k-content-1236554309,Entertainment,variety.com,Naman Ramachandran,https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Pyramid-Game.jpg?w=1000&h=563&crop=1,2025-10-16T06:17:23+00:00,64f0e9ec1f2c51b92afdaf856c202160b6169e57
30cd804f05b1,"‘Conclave’ Composer Volker Bertelmann, ‘The Brutalist’s’ Daniel Blumberg Win at the 25th World Soundtrack Awards",,"German composer Volker Bertelmann was named Film Composer of the Year at the Ghent Film Festival’s prestigious World Soundtrack Awards on Wednesday for his work on Edward Berger’s “Conclave” and James Hawes’ “The Amateur.” This is the second time Bertelmann has won the award, having nabbed it just two years ago for his scores for “War Sailor,” “Memory of Water” and his Oscar-winning music for “All Quiet on the Western Front.” Bertelmann couldn’t attend the ceremony but sent a video message thanking both Berger and Hawes for “giving me the chance to experiment.” “I recognize it’s so nice to have directors who let you do your thing when you can stretch the boundaries and experiment a bit more. It’s a collaborative process, but ultimately you have to find your voice.” British composer Daniel Blumberg, the recipient of this year’s best original score Oscar for his work on Brady Corbet’s “ The Brutalist ,” won the Discovery of the Year award. Several other awards were also handed out at the ceremony, which was interspersed with a concert by the Brussels Philharmonic, conducted by Dirk Brossé. Theodore Shapiro won Television Composer of the Year for his work on “Severance,” and Clément Ducol, Camille and Jacques Audiard were others to repeat their Oscar feats by winning best original song for “El Mal” from “Emilia Pérez.” Shapiro thanked “Severance” while accepting his award. “I want to thank working on a show that is so incredibly generous in the space that it allows for music to have a real voice and character on the show. Not every project gives music that kind of space, so I want to thank Ben Stiller for his vision of what language this show was going to be. I’m grateful to have him as a friend.” This year marks a landmark 25th edition for the World Soundtrack Awards. The event originated from Belgium’s Film Fest Ghent , which cleverly realized it needed to set itself apart from similar film festivals in the 1980s. The festival’s focus on film music eventually settled into the World Soundtrack Awards and its parent organization, the World Soundtrack Academy, in 2001. The anniversary begged for “unique celebrations,” with the WSA choosing to honor two “absolute legends of the game” in Philip Glass (“The Hours”) and Michael Nyman (“The Piano”). The duo received the Lifetime Achievement Awards and are being further honored at the festival with a special concert titled “Minimalism in Motion: Glass, Nyman and Beyond” on Thursday. Their music will be performed live alongside the work of contemporary minimalists Emilie Levienaise-Farrouch (“All Of Us Strangers”) and Martin Phipps (“Napoleon”). The WSA also highlighted two guests of honor in Debbie Wiseman and A. R. Rahman. Wiseman is one of the most prolific British and television composers of her time, with work that includes “Tom & Viv” and “To Olivia and Wilde.” Meanwhile, Rahman is a two-time Oscar winner and is “arguably the biggest Indian composer for the screen working today.” He has numerous credits in Bollywood and won the Oscar for his work on Danny Boyle’s “Slumdog Millionaire.” “Bugonia” composer Jerskin Fendrix returned to Ghent after making history at the awards in 2024, becoming the first person ever to win both Film Composer of the Year and the Discovery of the Year Award for his work on Yorgos Lanthimos’ “Poor Things.” Speaking from the stage before his award-winning music was played live, Jerskin, who also scored Lanthimos’ “Kinds of Kindness,” said he is at a point where he has “no other choice” but to continue to collaborate with the Greek director. “I was writing songs before I started working with Yorgos,” he recalled of the beginning of their collaboration. “To a certain extent, songwriting can be very self-centered, and when you’re writing for something like ‘Poor Things,’ you have to wipe yourself off the desk. Through doing these scores with Yorgos, I think I gained a good amount of artistic empathy. It’s been really, really helpful. He’s really supportive. I feel very lucky, generally.” World Soundtrack Awards 2025, courtesy of WSA To mark the 25th anniversary, the WSA released a triple album including: “Debbie Wiseman: Music for Film and Television,” featuring all-new studio recordings from the British composer behind “Edie” and “Tom and Viv”; “Craig Armstrong: Music For Film,” an expanded reissue of the first album launched by the festival back in 2007; and “World Soundtrack Awards – 25th Anniversary Celebration,” a limited-edition vinyl set bringing together over two decades of WSA history and featuring live recordings of memorable live and studio performances at the festival.

4c8e2f45d291,‘The Diplomat’ Re-Centers Keri Russell and Rufus Sewell’s Live Wire Chemistry With an Effective Season 3 Shake-Up: TV Review,,"SPOILER ALERT: This review contains a plot detail from the Season 3 premiere of “ The Diplomat ,” now streaming on Netflix. There are no other spoilers about the rest of the season. Season 3 of “The Diplomat” is the first installment of the Netflix political drama to come out since the 2024 presidential election, which means the series is now even more of an escapist fantasy than it already was. Watching Ambassador Kate Wyler ( Keri Russell ) stalk the halls of the United States embassy in London, earnestly working to satisfy Danish concerns over British oil drilling in the North Sea and gushing over bipartisan treaties as the key to domestic popularity, it’s hard not to think of Elon Musk’s minions laying waste to USAID or trade wars conducted via Truth Social. These pangs are only compounded by the cliffhanger that concluded Season 2, in which President William Rayburn (Michael McKean) suffered a fatal heart attack and elevated his vice president, Grace Penn (Allison Janney), to the top of the call sheet. If a female VP struggling to gauge how much distance to place between herself and her now-former boss while she attempts to fill his shoes gives you a sinking feeling, this season may be a tough sit. The good news is that “The Diplomat,” still under the leadership of creator Debora Cahn, makes other changes that bring the series back to its core strengths. At just six episodes, and with a fast-paced plot unfolding in the immediate aftermath of an explosion that injured multiple major characters, Season 2 diverted its focus from the volatile marriage between Kate and her husband, Hal ( Rufus Sewell ), also a veteran of the foreign service. The accelerated momentum was helpful in stabilizing — or perhaps acclimating viewers to — the show’s mishmash of tones, which staple together motormouthed policy wonkery and combustible romantic chemistry. But Season 3 goes beyond extending the pre-existing story and meaningfully alters the status quo. Paradoxically, shaking up “The Diplomat” also returns the series to its roots: the tug-of-war between the aspirations of two ambitious people, both straining against the gender dynamics of monogamous heterosexual marriage. Grace’s sudden promotion creates many job openings in the new administration, chief among them her old gig. Hal spent the first two seasons of “The Diplomat” scheming, along with White House Chief of Staff Billie Appiah (Nana Mensah), to get Kate promoted to VP. To Hal’s mind, the plan was — along with moving to London — a mea culpa for subordinating his wife’s career to his own for many years, even though she’s a capable professional in her own right; to Kate, Hal’s maneuvering behind her back was her husband once again going rogue to serve his own agenda. The question of just how sincere Hal is in wanting Kate to take the lead for once is one of the animating tensions of “The Diplomat.” Which is why Grace offering the job to Hal over his better half is so good for the health of the show. The idea that Hal’s Richard Holbrooke-esque résumé would land him in the line of succession is part of the series’ alternate reality, where the only skill that matters is wielding American influence abroad with an expert knowledge of protocol. (The entire season premiere is dedicated to the minutiae and optics of Grace’s swearing-in: where to stage the event, which Bible to use and who to administer the oath of office.) This institutionalist worldview, inherited from Cahn’s old workplace “The West Wing,” can grate in light of recent events; a casual mention of the Jared Kushner-negotiated Abraham Accords of the first Trump administration raised my eyebrows given ensuing developments in the Israel-Palestine conflict. It’s also less tenable with Hal working out of the White House, an office with a much broader portfolio than that of a diplomatic mission — including domestic issues “The Diplomat” still largely avoids. Regardless, there are real benefits to Hal’s new workplace. One is simply expanding the world of the show, which has added a production outpost in New York (where Russell and Cahn both live) that enables setpieces like a “Succession”-esque interlude at Grace’s Hamptons retreat. Mensah, once confined largely to Zoom, FaceTime and phone calls as her character patched in from D.C., gets to join the ensemble in earnest as she spars with the Wylers face-to-face. Both she and the new environs are breaths of fresh air. The shock to Hal and Kate’s equilibrium, already unsteady to begin with, is even more rewarding. For two seasons, Hal tried and mostly failed to occupy the role of “ambassador’s wife,” as he introduces himself to Grace’s husband Todd (Bradley Whitford). (With Whitford joining Janney and Cahn in the “West Wing” reunion, one wonders if Richard Schiff is waiting in the wings for Season 4.) Now, he’s once again in the higher-profile position, a shift Kate tries to spin as “all upside” — he can negotiate a bigger role for her! she can get a meeting with any foreign dignitary she wants! — before admitting how she really feels. When asked if playing second fiddle is what she actually wants, Kate sighs: “Apparently. It’s what I keep choosing.” The season’s second episode looks back on the early days of Hal and Kate’s relationship as they contemplate this major change. It is, to this critic’s mind, the finest chapter of “The Diplomat” to date, because it centers the unhappy power couple that is the show’s most singular creation. Sewell gives Hal a childlike quality for both good and for ill; he’s as sincerely enthusiastic as he is reflexively selfish and petulant. Russell, for her part, can match Sewell’s intensity without uttering a word, as in a scene where Kate silently unpins her hair while Hal spirals out over Grace’s VP offer. And with Grace and Todd, “The Diplomat” gives Kate and Hal a mutual foil, and perhaps a look into their future. Kate finds commonality with Todd as the spouse shut out of the room where it happens, but she doesn’t want to be him. Ultimately, “The Diplomat” doesn’t have much to say about international relations, being too in love with surface pageantry and process to dive into the real power dynamics beneath. Rather, it’s a story about the messy intersection of love, work and the battle of the sexes, with a setting grand enough to heighten both the stakes and the eroticism. In Season 3, “The Diplomat” recommits to this core mission, a pivot that pays dividends. “The Diplomat” Season 3 is now streaming on Netflix.",https://variety.com/2025/tv/reviews/the-diplomat-season-3-review-keri-russell-1236554173,Entertainment,variety.com,Alison Herman,https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/The_Diplomat_n_S3_E7_00_27_13_06RC.jpg?w=1000&h=563&crop=1,2025-10-16T07:01:00+00:00,8e73df7c7a38326255d4427002fc0cc2387e55f7

The images show a contemporary staging that reimagines Shakespeare’s tragedy in late-20th-century Scotland. Heughan appears in casual modern clothing — a white tank top with an open shirt and gold chain — while the set features a detailed bar environment with bottles, fluorescent tubes and intimate staging. Sam Heughan – “Macbeth” Helen Murray Several photos show dramatic moments, including scenes with visible stage blood that emphasize the play’s violent narrative. Conor McLeod – “Macbeth” Helen Murray Director Daniel Raggett has relocated the story to 1990s Glasgow’s working-class neighborhoods, framing the power struggle through the lens of gang conflicts and family feuds. The design, captured in Helen Murray’s moody photographs, uses stark lighting and a stripped-down aesthetic that brings audiences close to the action in an in-the-round configuration. Lia Williams – “Macbeth” Helen Murray Raggett previously helmed the RSC’s 2024 staging of Marlowe’s “Edward II” with Daniel Evans. For this production, he has drawn inspiration from Scottish filmmaker Peter Mullan’s work, Francis Ford Coppola’s “Godfather” films, and recent psychological horror cinema like Ari Aster’s “Hereditary.” Sam Heughan – “Macbeth” Helen Murray Lia Williams plays Lady Macbeth in what is otherwise an entirely Scottish cast spanning multiple generations. The company includes Alec Newman as Macduff, Nicholas Karimi as Banquo, and Alison Peebles, Eilidh Fisher and Irene Macdougall as the three witches. Irene MacDougall, Eilidh Fisher, Alison Peebles – “Macbeth” Helen Murray Heughan has spent the past decade primarily in television and film, becoming widely known for playing Jamie Fraser on Starz’s “ Outlander ” alongside Caitriona Balfe. He trained at the Royal Scottish Academy of Music and Drama and earned a 2003 Olivier nomination for most promising performer for David Greig’s “Outlaying Islands” at the Royal Court and Traverse Theatre. His stage credits also include “Crime & Punishment,” “The Seagull” and “Prometheus Bound.” Lia Williams – “Macbeth” Helen Murray The production features design by Anna Reid, lighting by Ryan Day, and an original score by Tommy Reilly.

The role marks her 124th screen appearance across a career spanning more than six decades. Since her film debut in 1959’s “Asa o yobu kuchibue,” Yoshinaga has remained at the forefront of Japanese cinema. She has won the Japan Academy Film Prize for best leading actress multiple times, including for “Ohan,” “Station to Heaven,” “Crane,” “A Chaos of Flowers,” “Nagasaki Bura Bura” and “Year One in the North.” Her work has earned recognition at the highest levels of Japanese society, with the government naming her a Person of Cultural Merit and bestowing the Medal with Purple Ribbon. Yoshinaga served as both producer and star of “Cape Nostalgia,” which took home both the jury grand prix and the ecumenical jury prize at the Montreal World Film Festival.

Published On 16 Oct 2025 16 Oct 2025 Click here to share on social media share2 Share A new study by World Weather Attribution and United States-based Climate Central has calculated the increase in dangerous “superhot days” – defined as warmer than 90 percent of comparable days between 1991 and 2020 – due to climate change. The report, which is not yet peer-reviewed but uses established techniques for climate attribution, was released on Thursday. It highlights the significant effect of the Paris Climate Agreement . Recommended Stories list of 3 items end of list Before the 2015 accord, the world was on track for a catastrophic 4C (7.2F) of warming by the end of the century, which would have resulted in an additional 114 superhot days per year. By fulfilling current commitments to curb emissions, the world is now heading towards 2.6C (4.7F) of warming. Under this scenario, the Earth will still add 57 superhot days annually by 2100 – nearly two months of dangerously high temperatures – but this is half the increase of the worst-case scenario. Since 2015, the world has already added 11 superhot days on average. Potsdam Climate Institute Director Johan Rockstrom, who was not part of the research team, said people should not be relieved that we are no longer on the 4-degree warming pre-Paris trajectory because the current track “would still imply a disastrous future for billions of humans on Earth”. The report does not say how many people will be affected by the additional dangerously hot days, but coauthor Friederike Otto of Imperial College London said “it will definitely be tens of thousands or millions, not less”. She noted that thousands die in heatwaves each year already. The study also underscores the profound unfairness of the impact of climate change across the world, showing a massive disconnect between carbon pollution and expected heat exposure. The 10 countries that will experience the biggest increase in dangerous heat days are almost all small, ocean-dependent nations like Panama, the Solomon Islands, and Samoa. These countries are expected to see the largest spikes, with Panama projected to face 149 extra superhot days a year. These 10 nations collectively produce only 1 percent of global heat-trapping gases. In stark contrast, the top carbon-polluting countries – the United States, China, and India – are predicted to get only between 23 and 30 extra superhot days. Despite being responsible for 42 percent of the world’s carbon dioxide, they will face less than 1 percent of the additional superhot days. University of Victoria climate scientist Andrew Weaver, who was not part of the study team, said this heat inequality drives “yet another wedge between have and have-not nations”, potentially sowing seeds of geopolitical instability.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/16/climate-study-finds-overheating-world-will-add-57-superhot-days-a-year,World,aljazeera.com,Mariamne Everett,https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/AP25288763940364-1760598054.jpg?resize=1920%2C1440,,59a2f0b66e9e7cbcd463f9bf6c488cabf4c4e672

By Wednesday, the official death toll had reached 66, with the number of missing people increasing to 75. Nearly 200 communities remain isolated — predominantly in Hidalgo’s central mountainous region, where persistent cloud cover has hindered helicopter access. A persistent dust cloud hangs over the main avenue of Poza Rica, a gulf-adjacent oil-producing city, where soldiers laboured continuously. To the east, near the overflowed Cazones River, numerous streets remained submerged under 3 feet (about 1 metre) of water and mud, covered by an additional 6 feet of accumulated rubbish, furniture, and debris. “A week later, this looks horrible — worse. You can’t even cross the street,” lamented Ana Luz Saucedo, who escaped with her children when water rushed in “like the sea”. She now fears disease because a decomposing body near her home remains uncollected. “The dead body has already started to rot, and no one has come for him.” The impact of last week’s catastrophic rains, floods, and landslides continues to unfold as Mexico’s government proceeds with rescue and recovery operations. Officials attribute the disaster to multiple converging weather systems — two tropical systems colliding with warm and cold fronts — arriving as an unusually intense rainy season concluded, leaving saturated rivers and unstable hillsides. Residents like Saucedo believe warnings were insufficient, particularly in Poza Rica. “Many people died because they didn’t give notice — really, they didn’t warn us,” she said. “They came only when the river was already overflowing … not before, so people could evacuate.” President Claudia Sheinbaum explained that alert systems for such events differ from hurricane warnings. She acknowledged the need to review river maintenance and emergency protocols after the crisis to determine “what worked, what we need to improve and whether there are better alert mechanisms”. Military, naval, and civilian emergency teams continue operating across affected states, supplemented by hundreds of volunteers. In Poza Rica, women from Veracruz distributed clothing and 1,000 pots of homemade tamales to flood victims. Meanwhile, authorities work to clear blocked roadways, restore electricity, and monitor dams — many now at maximum capacity.",https://www.aljazeera.com/gallery/2025/10/16/a-week-after-the-floods-central-mexico-still-reels-from-the-devastation,World,aljazeera.com,,https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/AP25289059864672-1760596474.jpg?resize=1920%2C1440,,e5d7fa01ed654623be2c7b03e1c354e8abb0d7c4

It’s the tale of the Wellsleys, an aristocratic family desperate to save their ancestral property due to insurmountable debts. Hailing from an illustrious family of actors, Redgrave’s first lead in “Morgan: A Suitable Case for Treatment” (1966), by Karel Reisz, won her best actress at Cannes and scored BAFTA and Oscar nominations. She returned to Cannes in the following year as Jane, the mysterious woman in the park in “Blow Up” by Michelangelo Antonioni. More Oscar nominations followed: in 1969 for her performance as Isadora Duncan in “Isadora” by Reisz, which again won her best actress at Cannes, and in 1972 for Charles Jarrott’s “Mary, Queen of Scots,” which won her a special David at Italy’s David di Donatello Awards. Her performance in Fred Zinnemann’s “Julia” (1978) won her an Oscar, and she scored further nominations for James Ivory’s “The Bostonians” (1985) and “Howards End” (1993). In 1994, she received the Volpi Cup in Venice for “Little Odessa” by James Gray. “When you are nominated for an Oscar six times, you’re no longer just one of the world’s greatest actresses: you become a legend,” said Torino artistic director Giulio Base in a statement. He went on to note that “Vanessa Redgrave is an icon of theater and cinema, but also a committed activist.” Torino’s 43nd edition is being held Nov. 21-29 in the Northern Italian city of Turin.

a2e95c80580a,"Insurrection Act: What is it, and does US president have plenary authority?","news, donald trump, explainer, military, politics, united states, us & canada","When asked whether United States President Donald Trump would invoke the Insurrection Act , Vice President JD Vance said this week that Trump is “looking at all his options”. The decision would allow Trump to deploy the US military domestically for law enforcement purposes without congressional authorisation and over the objections of state governors. Recommended Stories list of 4 items end of list Vance’s October 12 comment on NBC’s Meet the Press was just one of many in recent months about Trump’s ambitions to send the National Guard to Democratic cities such as Portland and Chicago. But the legal terms being tossed around – Insurrection Act, plenary authority, martial law, Posse Comitatus Act – have traditionally not been commonly used in US politics. These terms defy simple definitions after decades of interpretation by the courts. We explain what they are: What is the Insurrection Act? This 1807 law allows the US president to deploy federal military personnel domestically to suppress rebellion and enforce civilian law. Invoking the Insurrection Act temporarily suspends another US law that forbids federal troops from conducting civilian law enforcement. A president can invoke the law after determining that “unlawful obstructions, combinations, or assemblages, or rebellion” against the federal government make it “impracticable to enforce” US law “by the ordinary course of judicial proceedings”, the law says. In those cases, the Insurrection Act would allow the president to direct federal troops to enforce US laws or stop a rebellion. The law is broadly written and does not define terms such as “insurrection” or “rebellion”. The US Supreme Court ruled in 1827 that the president has exclusive power to decide whether a situation represents an acceptable reason to invoke the law. Chris Edelson, an American University assistant professor of government, previously said the law provides “limited authority” for the president to use the military to respond to “genuine emergencies – a breakdown in regular operational law when things are really falling apart”. The Insurrection Act has been formally invoked about 30 times in the US since 1808, including when southern governors refused to integrate schools in the 1950s and 60s and during the 1992 Los Angeles riots, after four white police officers were acquitted in the roadside beating of Rodney King, a Black man. What is martial law? People sometimes conflate martial law with the Insurrection Act. Martial law typically refers to imposing military law on civilians, while the Insurrection Act uses the military to impose civilian law. Martial law is more stringent and has fewer protections than civilian law, experts said. The Supreme Court wrote in a 1946 ruling that the term martial law “carries no precise meaning” and that it was not defined in the Constitution or in an act of Congress. Legal experts say, because of this, it is not clear whether the US president has a legal path to declaring martial law in the way that it is commonly understood. Still, it has been declared in the past. The US imposed martial law in Hawaii after the 1941 Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, and President Abraham Lincoln declared martial law in certain parts of the country during the Civil War. The Supreme Court held in 1866 that martial law could be imposed only if civilian courts were not functioning. The court “more or less found that martial law could only be declared in an active war zone”, said Chris Mirasola, University of Houston Law Center assistant professor. “The circumstances within which presidents have invoked martial law and that the Supreme Court has understood martial law are incredibly narrow. It would require an active hostility on US territory that prevents civilian legal proceedings from occurring.” Trump, who has shown a willingness to challenge constitutional precedent, has continued to muse about using military powers against civilians. Trump told top US military commanders on September 30 that the military could be used against the “enemy within” and suggested that some cities could be used as military “training grounds”. What is plenary authority? “Plenary authority” is defined by the Legal Information Institute at Cornell Law School as “power that is wide-ranging, broadly construed, and often limitless for all practical purposes”. The term made headlines when White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller started to say that Trump has “plenary authority” to deploy National Guard troops to US cities in an October 6 CNN interview. Miller abruptly stopped talking, and CNN said the disruption was due to a technical glitch. But social media users said Miller froze because he mentioned plenary authority. When the show returned, Miller finished his answer, saying he was “making the point that under federal law, Title 10 of the US Code, the president has the authority anytime he believes federal resources are insufficient to federalise the National Guard to carry out a mission necessary for public safety”. Although the president has broad powers under the Constitution, like issuing pardons for federal crimes, he does not have limitless power. The US government is divided into three branches – legislative, executive and judicial – in order to have checks and balances. Title 10 of the US Code outlines the role of the country’s armed forces and constrains what the military is allowed to do and what orders the president can lawfully issue. It does not include terms like “plenary authority” or “plenary power”. Instead, it says when the president “is unable with the regular forces to execute the laws” and the US faces a foreign invasion, a rebellion, or danger of rebellion, the president “may call into Federal service members and units of the National Guard of any state”. A judge in Oregon has twice blocked the Trump administration from deploying National Guard troops to Portland; a federal appeals court also blocked the administration from deploying the guard to Chicago, saying troops can remain federalised for now but cannot be deployed. Trump officials say the guard is needed to protect Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officers and federal facilities. Trump previously cited section 12406 of Title 10 when he called for National Guard troops to be sent to Los Angeles during immigration protests in June. A federal judge ruled in September that the deployment violated the law. The administration is appealing. What is the Posse Comitatus Act? The Posse Comitatus Act, passed in 1878, generally prevents the use of the military as a domestic police force on US soil, with exceptions for the Insurrection Act. The phrase “posse comitatus” refers to a group of people called upon by a county sheriff to maintain peace and suppress lawlessness. Think of Western movie depictions of posses of townspeople gathering to catch fugitives. “The Posse Comitatus Act is so named because one of the things it prohibits is using soldiers rather than civilians as a posse comitatus,” the Brennan Center for Justice, a nonprofit policy institute, wrote in 2021. As the Posse Comitatus Act has been interpreted by the courts, civilian law enforcement officials cannot make “direct active use” of military personnel, including using federal military forces, over their citizens to “regulatory, prescriptive, or compulsory authority,” according to the Congressional Research Service. The Posse Comitatus Act does not apply to the National Guard when it is under state authority and the command of a governor; the law’s restrictions apply when the National Guard is federalised by the president. This means the National Guard generally cannot conduct arrests, searches or seizures unless there is an exception, such as the Insurrection Act. The only National Guard exception is the District of Columbia’s, which is solely under federal control. What is the National Guard? The National Guard is a state-based military force with certain federal responsibilities. It often responds to domestic emergencies, such as natural disasters and civil unrest, and can support US military operations overseas. More than 430,000 National Guard members serve in units in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, and the US territories of Guam, Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Islands. The National Guard typically operates as a part-time reserve force that can be mobilised for active duty by governors. The guard also helps train foreign allies in more than 100 countries under the State Partnership Program. A president, in some cases, can federalise and take control of a state’s National Guard over the objection of governors for domestic missions and to serve in wars overseas, but it rarely happens without governors’ consent. When the National Guard is federalised, its troops are subject to the same restrictions as federal troops. The National Guard has been federally mobilised in the US several times , including in response to the 2020 protests over the murder of George Floyd; the 1992 Los Angeles riots; and civil unrest following the 1968 assassination of Martin Luther King Jr. The Ohio National Guard’s 1970 deployment to antiwar protests at Kent State University resulted in troops shooting students, killing four people and injuring nine others.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/16/insurrection-act-what-is-it-and-does-us-president-have-plenary-authority,World,aljazeera.com,,https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/afp_68e4ff6dc04b-1759838061.jpg?resize=1920%2C1440,,a65374fc184d83637ae019bba00c68f8efbfb4c3

9eefc861a239,Analysis: Why Pakistan and the Taliban won’t find it easy to patch up,"news, conflict, military, pakistan taliban, politics, taliban, afghanistan, asia, pakistan","The recent downward spiral in Afghanistan-Pakistan relations would have been hard to imagine when Pakistani military and civilian leaders welcomed the Taliban’s return to power in Kabul in August 2021. A Taliban government, Islamabad believed, would be friendly to Pakistan and would become a bulwark against any security threats to the country. After all, Pakistan’s military and intelligence services had for more than two decades supported the Afghan Taliban movement. Between 2001 and 2021, this meant a contradictory foreign policy. On the one hand, by supporting the United States’ military intervention in Afghanistan, Pakistan recognised the US-backed governments that ruled the country. At the same time, Pakistan covertly tolerated – and even enabled – the resurgence of the Taliban inside Pakistani territory, which also included cohabitation with other Pakistani fighter groups. Yet, that relationship has now collapsed as the Pakistani air force struck targets in Kabul for the first time this week. An apparent disconnect in their mutual expectations and disrespect for each other’s capabilities make it harder for them to resurrect what they once had. What is at stake for both countries? The Pakistani security establishment, comprised of the army and the country’s powerful military intelligence agency, the Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI), is responsible for devising and driving the nation’s Afghan policy. Historically, the army has also exercised significant power over the civilian administrations, even when Pakistan was not under military rule. Pakistan has faced a surge of unprecedented attacks against its security forces since 2021, coinciding with the Taliban’s return to power in Afghanistan. More than 2,400 deaths were recorded for the first three quarters of 2025, towering over last year’s total figure of about 2,500 people killed in attacks across Pakistan. Pakistan has blamed a majority of attacks on the Pakistan Taliban, known by the acronym TTP, whose leaders are now based in Afghanistan. TTP members hail largely from the tribal areas of Pakistan, along the Afghan border. Pakistan had hoped that TTP leaders would leave Afghanistan once the Pakistan-friendly Taliban government was established in Kabul. Some TTP fighters reportedly did return home, but this did not translate into a decline in violence. The TTP demands a localised implementation of Islamic law and the reinstatement of the former semi-autonomous status of tribal areas bordering Afghanistan. For Pakistan, confronting a deadly and persistent uprising at home has become a national security crisis. The country is, meanwhile, also reeling from several other intersecting crises: A stunted economy, geopolitical tensions with archrival India – marked by the recent conflict in May – as well as growing domestic political discontent, and natural disasters. Taliban leaders in Afghanistan insist that the TTP is a domestic challenge for Pakistan to address. In 2022, shortly after forming an interim administration, the Taliban government mediated talks between TTP leaders and the Pakistani army in Kabul. After initial indications of progress, underpinned by a temporary ceasefire, the talks collapsed. For the Taliban government, which is heavily sanctioned and isolated from international financial institutions, the realities of ruling a vastly underdeveloped and economically poor country are stark. Over four years since taking power, Russia is the only country that has formally recognised the Taliban administration, though a growing number of countries – China, India and Iran among them – have acknowledged the group as Afghanistan’s rulers and are hosting their diplomatic representatives. Afghans are suffering from the near-collapse of the economy, and public sector institutions, such as health and education services, are on the brink of a complete breakdown. Faced with severe food shortages and humanitarian challenges, Afghans suffer as United Nations-led aid agencies face funding cuts. A prolonged conflict with Pakistan is likely to further deepen these challenges. Can both sides return to their past friendship? Both sides appear, at the moment, to be digging their heels in. Though they have agreed to temporary ceasefires, neither side wants to look weak by admitting it needs to back down. Official Pakistani government statements now refer to the Taliban government – whose return to power in Kabul was once celebrated – as a “regime”, calling for a more “inclusive” administration in Afghanistan. They warn of continuing attacks within Afghan territories if the Taliban fail to act against the TTP. To be sure, Pakistan possesses a substantially more powerful military, technologically advanced weaponry, and considerable geopolitical leverage against the Taliban government. There is also a renewed sense of self-confidence as Pakistan considers it successfully fought the recent war with India in May 2025, including by downing multiple Indian jets. Since the 1980s, it has hosted millions of Afghan refugees, a generation of whom were educated and have built livelihoods in Pakistani cities. This, according to Pakistani leaders and some public opinion, should mean that Afghans must bear goodwill towards Pakistan. Forcing out Afghan refugees will be a key leverage Pakistan would want to use against the Taliban government. Fundamentally, Pakistani leaders view their country as a serious and powerful entity with strong global alliances – one that any Afghan government, especially one led by a group supported by Pakistan, should respect and cooperate with. The Taliban, on the other hand, view themselves as victorious, battle-hardened fighters who waged a long and successful war against foreign occupation by a global superpower. Hence, a potential conflict imposed by a neighbour would be a lesser mission. Taliban spokesmen are pushing back against Pakistani officials’ recent narrative, underlining the significance of the ongoing information war on both sides. They have alleged, for instance, that Pakistan’s tribal border areas shelter ISIL (ISIL) fighters with tacit backing from elements of the Pakistani army. Nonetheless, as a landlocked country, Afghanistan is heavily dependent on trade routes via Pakistan, which remain shut due to ongoing tensions, resulting in major losses for traders on both sides. The Taliban government lacks air defence systems, radars or modern weaponry to counter any further incursions by Pakistani drones and jets. The path to de-escalation The Pakistani army continues to frame its fight against TTP as part of the wider confrontation with India. It has alleged, without evidence, that the armed group is backed by New Delhi. Pakistan also expects the Taliban to disown and distance themselves from the TTP and instead align themselves with Islamabad. However, the TTP and Taliban share long-term camaraderie, ideological compatibility and social bonds that go beyond stringent organisational peculiarities. For the Taliban, a conflict with the TTP could also risk creating space for minacious actors such as the ISIL affiliate in Khorasan Province (ISKP) armed group. And while Pakistan is stronger militarily, the Taliban have their own tools that could hurt Islamabad. What if the Taliban’s Kandahar-based supreme leader, Haibatullah Akhunzada, were to issue a fatwa for war against Pakistan’s security establishment? The TTP leadership had already pledged allegiance to Akhunzada in 2021. But the Taliban’s top leader is also held in high religious regard by a large segment of Pakistani religious school students and religious leaders, and a call against Islamabad from Akhunzada could lead to serious internal security challenges for Pakistan. Islamist political groups in Pakistan would also not support an all-out war with the Taliban. Meanwhile, any sustained Pakistani attacks against Afghanistan will likely bolster domestic support for the incumbent Taliban administration, even when there is palpable resentment among Afghans against the Taliban. To prevent further escalation and seek meaningful political dialogue, there is an urgent need for a trusted mediation actor capable of sustainable engagement. This role is best suited for Middle Eastern and Muslim nations trusted by both sides, such as Qatar and Saudi Arabia. There is evidence that this is a fruitful pathway. Taliban Foreign Minister Amir Khan Muttaqi confirmed in a news conference in New Delhi last week that the Taliban ceased retaliatory attacks against Pakistan after Qatar and Saudi Arabia mediated. But first, there needs to be a real desire for peace from the leaders in Pakistan and Afghanistan. Even as Afghan and Pakistani officials hurl warnings at each other, and their forces engage in repeated bouts of cross-border fire, both countries are acutely aware that war will cost them heavily. However, this does not mean that relations will return to the erstwhile bilateral warmth anytime soon or that miscalculations cannot happen. Geography and history bind Afghans and Pakistanis into interdependence, which needs to be capitalised upon. Governments need to stop hoping in vain for the success of failed approaches that have been tried for decades. Afghan leaders must work at developing amicability with Pakistan. Pakistani leaders need to reciprocate by conceiving a wholesome foreign policy towards Afghanistan, which is not coloured by rivalry with India. The world does not need yet another war in the Afghanistan-Pakistan region. It can never bear better dividends than peace.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/16/analysis-why-pakistan-and-the-taliban-wont-find-it-easy-to-patch-up,World,aljazeera.com,Hameed Hakimi,https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/AP25288196227461-1760579611.jpg?resize=1920%2C1440,,cf3ed2888e93f3b3e3d8a46563fc227d85b7ce2b

As of Thursday, fewer than 300 trucks are entering Gaza , instead of the 600 trucks necessary to deliver humanitarian aid. And of the 300 trucks being allowed to enter daily, Al Jazeera has learned that many carry commercial products instead of humanitarian aid.

They need clothes, shoes, hygiene kits, medical supplies, and nothing is going to be delivered to the population until they have good stock in the warehouses, so that’s why we’re not seeing any distributions happening on the ground now. “What is entering are the commercial trucks and things that are being sold in the market.

At the Patient’s Friends Benevolent Society (PFBS) hospital in Gaza City, doctors describe the situation of some malnourished children as “desperate”, with the medical facility running out of medicine and food, as well as fuel to keep the facility functioning. “We are still waiting for the medical and other humanitarian aid to reach our hospital,” Dr Musab Farwana, a paediatrician, told Al Jazeera. “When they arrive, the situation will surely improve, especially for the children, who have been the most vulnerable group suffering from malnutrition in the two years of war.” Randa Aldhadar, mother of baby girl Ruqayya, told Al Jazeera that she is “desperate” for the humanitarian aid to arrive. The lack of food has left Randa unable to produce milk for Ruqayya, leaving her severely malnourished and “on the brink of death”. “The hospital has yet to provide the help necessary for my daughter to recover. Things like biscuits, milk and nutritional supplements, so she can recover and regain her health,” she said. Two years of Israeli bombardment across Gaza, attacking and destroying many medical facilities and killing hundreds of medics, and a complete humanitarian blockade since April have resulted in the collapse of the territory’s medical infrastructure. Hamas and Israel agreed last week to cease hostilities and return all remaining Israeli captives – dead and alive – in exchange for about 2,000 Palestinians held in Israeli prisons. The first phase of the agreement includes the lifting of the humanitarian blockade that would allow the delivery of food, water and medical aid into the territory. But Israeli restrictions are still choking the flow of aid, especially to the neediest patients in hospitals. At PFBS hospital in Gaza City, Tahani Hassouna is also in anguish as she continues to look after her infant daughter, Alma, who is suffering from a serious heart condition. “Due to the lack of medical equipment here [PFBS hospital], she’s not getting enough care,” she told Al Jazeera. “Her illness prevents her from gaining weight, and she has to fully rely on oxygen to be able to breathe,” she said. Tahani said that every day, she is anxiously waiting for the border to reopen, allowing her and her daughter to travel abroad for a life-saving surgery. As of Thursday, Israel has yet to announce the reopening of the Rafah crossing in southern Gaza. COGAT, the Israeli Defence Ministry body that oversees civil affairs in the Palestinian territory, also said on Thursday that no humanitarian aid will pass through the Rafah crossing, claiming this was never agreed upon at any stage. It said aid will continue to enter through the Karem Abu Salem (Kerem Shalom to Israelis) and other crossings. Trucks carrying humanitarian aid line up at the Rafah border on the Egyptian side of the crossing to the Gaza Strip on October 16, 2025. [Stringer/Reuters] At al-Shifa hospital , medical director Mohammed Abu Salmiya told Al Jazeera that he has not witnessed any notable progress in terms of health services or the availability of medicines since the ceasefire began.

Published On 16 Oct 2025 16 Oct 2025 Click here to share on social media share2 Share Madagascar ‘s new military leader, who came to power on the back of a popular rebellion, has announced that he will be sworn in as the country’s president, defying the decision of the African Union (AU) to suspend the island nation’s membership. The military seized power, forcing President Andry Rajoelina to flee the country last week. Colonel Michael Randrianirina announced late on Wednesday that he will take his oath as the country’s new leader on Friday, saying the High Constitutional Court will perform the ceremony. Recommended Stories list of 3 items end of list “Colonel Michael Randrianirina will be sworn in as the President for the Refoundation of the Republic of Madagascar during a formal hearing,” the statement read. The announcement throws the country deeper into a constitutional crisis, as Rajoelina has refused to renounce his position as president and earlier ordered the dissolution of the National Assembly. He had also accused the assembly of colluding with Randrianirina to mount the military takeover. In a statement to the AFP news agency late on Wednesday, Rajoelina said he left the country between October 11 and 12 after “explicit and extremely serious threats were made against the life of the Head of State”. According to news reports, Rajoelina was evacuated on Sunday on board a French military plane. On Monday, Rajoelina said he had taken refuge in a “safe place” without giving further details. Rajoelina has remained silent about the possibility of returning to the country. Randrianirina said earlier that the military had taken power and dissolved all institutions except the National Assembly. He also said a committee led by the military would rule for up to two years alongside a transitional government before organising new elections. The removal of the former leader followed weeks of deadly “Gen-Z” protests, which initially erupted over power and water shortages, and evolved into the most serious crisis the country and Rajoelina’s government had faced in years. Randrianirina was a commander in the elite CAPSAT army unit that played a key role in the 2009 coup, which brought Rajoelina to power, but broke ranks with him last week, urging soldiers not to fire on protesters. Madagascar is the latest of several former French colonies to have fallen under military control since 2020, after coups in Mali, Burkina Faso, Niger, Gabon and Guinea. On Wednesday, the AU suspended Madagascar as a member with immediate effect following the coup, and called for the restoration of civilian-led governance as well as elections. Suspension by the 55-member bloc carries political weight and could isolate the country’s new leadership.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/16/madagascars-new-army-ruler-to-be-sworn-in-as-rajoelina-confirms-departure,World,aljazeera.com,,https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/AFP__20251015__78VM8KB__v1__MidRes__MadagascarEconomyUnrest-1760604944.jpg?resize=1200%2C630,,52a51ea146baee16da4e306a72ac1b406e24a03c

Published On 16 Oct 2025 16 Oct 2025 Click here to share on social media share2 Share Patrick Kluivert’s stint as Indonesia coach is over after only nine months as both parties “mutually” agreed to part ways following a failed bid to reach the FIFA World Cup 2026. Indonesia’s hopes of qualifying for the tournament in North America next year ended with defeats by Iraq and Saudi Arabia in the past week in the fourth round of Asian Football Confederation (AFC) qualifiers. Recommended Stories list of 4 items end of list The former Netherlands and Barcelona forward was only appointed in January, on a two-year contract partway through Indonesia’s qualifying campaign, and was in charge for eight matches. The 49-year-old won three of his games in charge, losing four and drawing one. In a post on Instagram, Kluivert described his time in charge as “an unforgettable journey”. He added: “Even though I’m deeply disappointed and sorry for the fact that we didn’t make it to the World Cup, I’ll always be proud of what we built together. “The defeats against Saudi Arabia and Iraq were bitter lessons, but also reminders of how high our shared dreams are. As head coach, I take full responsibility.” The 49-year-old Kluivert replaced South Korean coach Shin Tae-yong amid the intensification of the Indonesian federation’s policy of naturalising players from Europe with Indonesian heritage. The programme helped take the team to the final stages of qualification for the first time since 1938, when it appeared at the World Cup as Dutch East Indies. The majority of Kluivert’s final roster of 23 were born overseas, mainly in the Netherlands. However, results didn’t noticeably improve under the new coaching setup. The Football Association of Indonesia, PSSI, said Kluivert’s departure was “through mutual termination”. “This step was taken as part of a comprehensive evaluation of the national football coaching and development programme,” it added. The statement did not name Kluivert’s successor. Amsterdam-born Kluivert retired as a player in 2008 after a stellar career that started at Ajax, where he won the Champions League, before moves to AC Milan and Barcelona. Kluivert’s managerial career has not been nearly as spectacular. His previous coaching role was in charge of Adana Demirspor in Turkiye for five months in 2023. Before that, he was caretaker manager of Curacao in 2021.

Baby Einstein

Amazon

Lowe's

Walmart

Target

The Baby Einstein Sea Dreams Soother has been in rotation in our house since day one. It’s part sensory toy, part sound machine, and doubles as a tummy time prop with its glowing lights and gentle motion. At night, the machine attaches to the crib and plays lullabies with a soft glow. I love that it combines multiple uses into one machine, so it’s a small but mighty tool that gets a lot of use during both playtime and bedtime. —Nicole Kinning

SweeTooth

Amazon

The SweeTooth Teether feels a little extra, but it’s totally worth it. Shaped like an ice cream cone, it’s just the right size for little hands to grab, and it happens to be the teether my daughter reaches for every time. Maybe it’s the subtle sweet vanilla scent that reels her in—can you blame her? Bonus: It’s easy to clean and dishwasher-safe, which makes me love it almost as much as she does. —Nicole Kinning

730 Project

Amazon (3-pack)

I skipped sippy cups altogether and went straight to straw training with this Amazon dupe of the Honey Bear cup . It’s simple but effective: Give the bottle a little squeeze to help your baby learn how to use the silicone straw. It fits neatly in a diaper bag’s bottle pocket, and it made the transition to straw cups pretty seamless. It’s also easy to take apart and clean—no fussing with tiny pieces—and it’s sturdy enough to survive the occasional roughhousing or chewing. —Nicole Kinning

Kids Preferred

Amazon

Barnes and Noble

This Goodnight Moon soft book is one of those things I picked up on a whim, thinking it wouldn’t make a difference in my day-to-day life as a mom. Boy, was I wrong! This crinkle book has kept my baby entertained on countless road trips, in restaurants, or any time I realize I forget to pack a little distraction for her in the diaper bag. It’s packed with textures, sounds, flaps, and even a teether on the corner, and it clips right onto a stroller or car seat. Selfishly, the condensed story is also nostalgic for me (I grew up with the classic), while my daughter just loves to grab, chew, and crinkle to her heart’s content. —Nicole Kinning

Grownsy

Amazon

Grownsy

Walmart

A baby bottle washer is worth every penny. I said it. In fact, I wrote a whole guide to them , and this was my top pick. This gift might be geared toward parents, rather than babies, but let’s be honest: The less time spent washing bottles, the more time you get with your baby. The Grownsy’s deep interior fits everything from 8-ounce bottles to pump parts, so you can load up a day’s worth of gear at once. With customizable wash modes, this machine quietly and efficiently handles all the work of cleaning grimy bottles without soaking, scrubbing, or chapped hands. —Nicole Kinning

Mushie

Amazon

Mushie

This swaddle was the superhero gift of my baby shower. My son used it every day for his first two years. He was a summer baby, and receiving two of these from his aunt was an absolute necessity to have something to wrap him in without making him too sweaty. We were constantly using it as a layer between him and us so that we wouldn't just sweat all over each other when he wanted a contact nap. These swaddles were large enough to help cover his infant car seat from sunshine in the car or stroller, and now that he's a toddler it's still big enough to use as a summer blanket for bedtime. It's winter now, and we're still using these swaddles as one of his blankets at bedtime. I can't rave enough about them. If you're giving these as a gift, grab two so that Baby will have a backup when they spit up on the first one. There are a ton of pastel colors and cute prints to choose from. — Nena Farrell

Tiny Love

Amazon

Target

My favorite thing to do when my son was really small was place him on different colorful blankets and play mats and watch him experience the kaleidoscope of entertainment 2 inches from his face. His favorite play mat was a hand-me-down from my own childhood, but I've been testing Tiny Love's massive, beautiful mats with my best friend's baby. The Super Mats are super for a reason: They're huge! We're talking over 3 feet on one side and just under 5 feet on the other. But that means plenty of room for Baby to wiggle and explore. The mat is nice and soft, too, which is great to gift to a friend with hardwood floors. There's tons of built-in entertainment, like a little mirror and chewable attachments, which Baby can learn to crawl to as they explore. — Nena Farrell

Munchkin

Amazon

Munchkin

If your favorite baby is a pacifier lover, gift them this little sanitizer so Mom and Dad can keep those pacis clean on the go. It comes with a little strap to hook it onto a diaper bag and uses UV light to sanitize the pacifier in about a minute. It's a handy gadget to have on the go after the pacifier is dropped yet again. You'll still need a wipe handy to clean off any true dirt or grime, but I loved using this to feel like I at least tried to get rid of unseen germs. — Nena Farrell

Walmart (Dragon)

Amazon (Spider)

Look, babies destroy books. I can't tell you how many books in my son's room no longer have covers, or have ripped-off flaps and straight-up eaten-away corners. But one of the sturdiest book series my son has loved is this colorful one by Rosie Greening. There are a handful of different ones, all with similar titles: Never Touch a Spider , Never Touch a Dragon , Never Touch a Polar Bear … the list goes on. It's all about never touching a certain animal or creature unless it's doing something silly that they'll only find in the pages of this book. These books are great for so many reasons: Nice and short! Fun and colorful! Lots of sensory parts to the pages! Hard to rip! My son got one as a gift, and now I'm just continually adding more to our collection. — Nena Farrell

Guidecraft Jr.

Amazon

Target

Guidecraft

I waited too long to get one of these for my kid. He was still into it at age 2 ½—it was his favorite spot to eat dinner, mix cupcakes, and even draw or use Play-Doh at our kitchen island. But I missed out on how we could've had all this kind of fun so much sooner. Especially since this Step-Up Tower from Guidecraft is the new junior version, and it's slimmer than the usual one. That slimmer size makes it easier to add to my kitchen, letting it fit in nicely size-wise without causing any obstructions, and the smaller size makes a smaller kiddo feel more secure. The tower is designed for 18 months and up, and if I have another kid, this tower will be ready and waiting on their half birthday. — Nena Farrell

Jellycat

Amazon

Jellycat

Everyone has heard of Jellycat stuffed animals these days; even the teens want their own. They make a great gift for newborns and toddlers, first as just a little buddy they can look at, and eventually a snuggly friend for bedtime and couch cuddles. Don't be afraid to get a fun Jellycat just because it's for a baby, either: My son has half a dozen of these, but his number one favorite is Grizzo Gremlin. — Nena Farrell

Infantino

Amazon

Target

Walmart (Activity Station)

These aren't real Lego bricks. These building blocks, which have a Lego look, are made by Infantino from a super soft, squishable plastic (BPA-free!) that's easy to stack, squeeze, or even chew on. It's a fun sensory toy as well as a chance to learn to stack and build Lego-style without needing to worry about sharp corners or Baby eating the pieces. My son mostly wanted me to build stuff he could knock down, but I'm hoping the early exposure leads to a love of Lego and building that we can enjoy together for years to come. — Nena Farrell

Vivobarefoot

Vivobarefoot

We're big fans of barefoot shoes around here, and it turns out babies can enjoy them just as much as adults. My son loved Vivobarefoot's Pluma Knit shoes right after he got the hang of walking. These shoes were nice and comfy to pull over his chunky feet, and he used the barefoot texture to his advantage to learn to climb up the slide at a ridiculously early age. He noticeably slipped less when wearing these, so I highly recommend them for new walkers. He had these right after turning 1 in a size 6, but they come in smaller sizes if the baby you're shopping for will be walking sooner (or has less-fat feet than my kid!). Plus, these shoes get a ton of compliments on the playground. — Nena Farrell

Fisher-Price

Walmart

Kohl's

Macy's

We play a lot of video games in our house, so it's no surprise we wanted to snag this baby video game controller for our kid. But it's been a fantastic toy to bring for long drives or when waiting at a restaurant for the food to come out. There are two settings—Learn and Game, per the name—each with its own set of sounds, so it doesn't get too boring to use repeatedly. It's small enough to throw in just about any diaper bag. My son has liked this version a lot better than the similar remote control toy ($15) .  — Nena Farrell

Fisher-Price

Amazon

Barnes and Noble

This little record player is for 18 months and up, but that didn't stop my son from playing with it as soon as he could belly-worm his way over to it. The Fisher Price Record Player comes with five colorful records, each playing two songs, and is sturdy enough to survive the following: constant chewing from a teething baby on both the records and the player, said records being ripped from the player mid-song multiple times, and an unknown number of bumps and throws to the device itself. My personal favorite song is “The Ants Go Marching.” It's a bop. — Nena Farrell

Early Rider

Early Rider

Made for ages 10 months to 2 years old, the Early Rider Bella Velio is an indoor balance bike that's fun for the little ones and pretty enough that no one will mind it's been abandoned in the middle of the rug again. The massive wheels are easy to maneuver while still providing plenty of challenge for a toddler to learn how to stay upright and go in the direction they want. The low profile means they won't have far to fall, and starting indoors where there's soft carpet is less stressful on Mom and Dad. — Nena Farrell

Little Tikes

Wayfair

Walmart

I bought my son a water table for his first birthday, and he's loved it both summers of his little life. I actually bought him the Step2Rain Water Table ($85) and added on this rechargeable water pump ($17) so that water would constantly rain down. But if I could go back in time, I'd get him the Foamo 3-in-1 Water Table instead. It's got a bubble machine and a foam machine built into it, and let me tell you: Toddlers go crazy for it. My son's friend has one, and he has never been so focused (or quiet, praise be) as when he's playing with foam on this water table. It's designed for 2 and up, but my 1-year-old was obsessed. — Nena Farrell

John Deere

Amazon

Target

Walmart

This cool toy, made for 18 months and up, lets a toddler disassemble and reassemble a dump truck with an included toy drill and large screws that attach the truck's pieces together. The hardest part for my son, even now as a 2-year-old, is remembering how to switch the drill's direction to either put the screws in or out. It's a really cool toy that will satisfy the mind of any budding builder or puzzle solver. — Nena Farrell

Yoto

Amazon

Yoto

Technically, the Yoto Player ( Read our review here ) isn't for children under 3 years old. My 2-year-old loved the Mini, though, and I wish I'd gotten it sooner to use as a music box or storyteller in his room during the months of being too young to do more than tummy time and another walk around the block. The Yoto uses cards with an NFC tag that you register with the Yoto app, and then they can play a variety of music and stories. My son's favorite cards are the Super Simple Songs Collection ($35) , followed by the Moana soundtrack ($15) You can even buy blank cards ($18) and make your own custom playlist of content. While the device is designed for ages 3 and up, there are still cards you can buy designed for babies and toddlers; you just need to be the one clicking the buttons. But before you know it, they'll be the DJ. — Nena Farrell

Newton

Amazon

Babies are so cute, and so gross. One minute they're sleeping peacefully, next they've managed to spit up all over the bed and themselves. Get your favorite baby an extra couple sets of sheets for those nights when accidents happen, because nothing's worse than running out of sheets at 2 am after another spit-up or leaky diaper incident. I like this set from Newton Baby ($40) since it's soft, organic, and comes with two crib sheets, plus there are lots of color combos to choose from for Baby's nursery.

Another good backup is extra swaddles or sleep sacks, depending on how old Baby is. (Swaddles are for newborns who can't roll, while sleep sacks are for all other baby stages!) I really like Kyte's gorgeous sleep sacks—they're nice and long, so my son didn't grow out of them as fast as he did Halo sleep sacks . I'd recommend a 1.0 TOG weight for most times of the year, but 0.5 is great for summer, and 2.5 is good for winter. — Nena Farrell

Melissa & Doug

Amazon

Wayfair

Walmart

Kohl's

As soon as my son could walk and start grabbing things, he wanted the kitchen broom. My mom saved the day by buying us this Melissa & Doug toy cleaning set that gave him his own pint-sized broom, mop, duster, hand broom, and dustpan. It's been great to placate him when he sees me sweeping or for him to grab on his own. It also works well enough that I can use it in place of my own broom when he won't give it back. Kids learn fast, so don't make my mistake and have a cat bowl nearby. They'll realize the mop is perfect for dipping into it. — Nena Farrell

Lovevery

Lovevery (Every Two Months)

Nervous you won't find a gift that's perfectly age-appropriate? Especially with how much babies can change between just 3 and 6 months, it can feel intimidating to try to find a toy they'll love and be able to use. Lovevery's Play Kits are organized in two- or three-month increments (e.g., 3-4 months, 5-6 months, 22-24 months), making it easy to nail a gift that's right for their developing skills. My son really loved the toys he tried from the various 1-year-old boxes, and the options range from newborn to 5 years old. — Nena Farrell

cb941aee91f9,"Stalagmites adhere to a single mathematical rule, scientists discover",,"Stalagmites all adhere to a mathematical rule, scientists have discovered after creating equations showing how the dramatic mineral formations develop into different shapes. The new mathematical descriptions could help scientists extract more accurate data about past climate conditions, the researchers noted in a study to be published the week of Oct. 13 in the journal PNAS. ""It turns out that the rich diversity of stalagmite shapes can be explained by one simple parameter,"" study co-author Piotr Szymczak , a physicist at the University of Warsaw, said in a statement . ""This is a rare case where the beauty we see in nature corresponds directly to a clean mathematical law."" Stalagmites can grow up to hundreds of feet tall from cave floors and take many different shapes — from sharp, narrow cones to wide, flat-topped mounds. They're created when mineral-rich water drips from the ceiling of a cave onto roughly the same spot for thousands of years, where it steadily deposits calcite in a tower growing from the cave floor. In the new study, Szymczak and his colleagues developed a set of mathematical equations that describes how all of these shapes come to be. They found that the shape a stalagmite eventually adopts is controlled by the rate at which water drips from the cave's ceiling onto the stalagmite, and how quickly the calcite in that water gets left behind. These can be represented by a single value called the Damköhler number. Fast-flowing water dripping from a cave ceiling tends to create pointy, cone-shaped stalagmites, while water that drips more slowly onto the same spot forms thicker, column-like stalagmites. When the water drips down from a great height, or doesn't drip in exactly the same place, wide stalagmites with flat tops can form. The scientists then validated their equations by comparing the expected shapes of stalagmites under different conditions to actual stalagmites taken from Postojna Cave in Slovenia.

""When we compared our analytic solutions with real cave samples, the match was remarkable,"" study co-author Matej Lipar , a physical geographer at the Research Centre of the Slovenian Academy of Sciences and Arts, said in the statement. ""It shows that even under natural, messy conditions, the underlying geometry is there."" Scientists could use this geometry to get more accurate data about past climate from the formations, the authors wrote in the study. Much like tree rings, stalagmites grow in layers, recording information about rainfall and temperature over time. Scientists use the ratios of different forms, or isotopes, of carbon in each layer to extract that information. The stalagmites' shape affects how those layers are deposited, which could in turn affect how scientists interpret the conditions under which they grew. ""Stalagmites are natural climate archives, but we now see that their geometry leaves its own imprint on the isotopic record,"" study co-author Anthony Ladd , a chemical engineer at the University of Florida, said in the statement. ""Recognizing this effect will allow us to extract more reliable information about past climates.""",https://www.livescience.com/planet-earth/geology/stalagmites-adhere-to-a-single-mathematical-rule-scientists-discover,Science,livescience.com,,https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/dKdkA5y2PEV2BtWAxugdy7-1600-80.jpg,2025-10-16T10:10:45+00:00,dfc48465306ad838d4182d19224ad6e7e6151d21
12ad08e7e208,Review: Proton Mail,"shopping, reviews, review, privacy, software, email","Further, Proton automatically identifies these mailing lists as “newsletters” and puts them in their own view. There, you can see how many messages they’ve sent, move addresses to different folders, and unsubscribe. Proton also shows the services you’ve already unsubscribed from. After unsubscribing from probably 100 mailing lists, I had at least half a dozen companies still sending me emails. I was able to chase them down and properly get off their lists. (Gmail also recently added a system for managing subscriptions .) The difference with Proton over other clients is that these tools are brought to the forefront. I had only five email addresses that it didn’t recognize as mailing lists. The vast majority of emails were categorized properly, and the app itself pushed me to use the tools available. A Cozy View Proton Mail via Jacob Roach The look of Proton is familiar. By default, you have a list-style inbox reminiscent of Gmail, with options for standard or “compact” spacing, the latter of which will squish down each line. You can use the column layout, which moves your inbox to the left of the screen with a view for each message on the right, similar to the default Outlook view. You also get a toolbar on the right that will show your contacts and calendar, and a menu on the left that shows your labels and folders. You’ve used an interface like this before. Proton Mail via Jacob Roach Once you start digging around, there are some important differences. When composing an email, you’ll find a handful of buttons at the bottom of the screen. One allows you to set a password, encrypting the email to its destination regardless of the server it travels through. Another lets you set an expiration date for messages, as well as attach your public key; more on that later. I don’t use AI writing assistants, but Proton allows you to run its writing assistant locally, which is an important distinction compared to nearly every other email service with a similar feature. Most AI features run on remote servers, so when you enter prompts with Google’s AI, for instance, those prompts and the responses are stored on Google’s servers. With Proton, you can keep that all local, no remote server involved. You’ll need a PC that meets certain system requirements, and generating text isn’t as fast as on Proton’s servers. But having the option is huge. Proton Mail via Jacob Roach As for reading emails, Proton goes out of its way to make things as straightforward as possible. By default, messages load in full rich text, including images. However, Proton will block images from loading if there are trackers tied to them. It will also, by default, ask for confirmation when you click a link, showing the full URL before it’s loaded. That’s important, especially on mobile devices where you can’t hover over a link to check whether an email is legitimate or a phishing attempt . Most of the features available in the web app or on desktop are available in Proton’s mobile app, which, at the time of writing, was very recently overhauled on Android and iOS. You can bind actions to swiping left or right to quickly archive or organize messages, as well as use offline mode, which is a new addition. My only issue with the mobile app is that it doesn’t provide the same tools for unsubscribing from mailing lists. They’re completely absent, so you’ll need to handle all of that through the web or desktop app.",https://www.wired.com/review/proton-mail,Technology,wired.com,Jacob Roach,"https://media.wired.com/photos/68eff0fa1cba2fbcf693a46d/191:100/w_1280,c_limit/proton-mail-app-Credit-Jacob-Roach.JPG",2025-10-16T07:00:00-04:00,87d4c63aa61c913a4d3f4df73c3ee03e6ecc3450
310687720108,Here’s What Your Browser Is Telling Everyone About You,"shopping, browsers, privacy, chrome, firefox, vpn, websites, the web","The problem with browser fingerprinting is that it's probabilistic in nature. It looks at a treasure trove of data to track you online, not any individual piece of information. A VPN, for instance, can hide your IP address and make you appear in a different location. If enough of the other data in your fingerprint is consistent, however, it can still be used to track you. Your IP address may be different, but just about everything else about your browsing is not. There may be practical use cases for fingerprinting, but you really don’t have much say in the matter. Even with protections like the GDPR, the moment you load a website, there are likely a few dozen (if not more) trackers copying the information your browser shares for their own purposes. Services like Fingerprint leverage that information to create an identifier, but make no mistake, the data is always there. How to Get Around Browser Fingerprinting You can’t get around browser fingerprinting, at least not without significant compromises to your browsing experience (more on that later). Even if you were to spoof or obfuscate every piece of data your browser sends along, that’d probably work against you. The goal with avoiding fingerprinting is to become a Jane Doe online; you want to disappear in the crowd, so every piece of data that makes you stand out sends up a red flag. The best way to fight back against fingerprinting is to hide or rotate enough information so that it’s more difficult to track you, not impossible. And that starts with a VPN, though it doesn’t make you fully anonymous. The clearest online fingerprint you leave is your IP address and physical location, and VPNs hide both. More importantly, many of the best VPNs today include additional tools to combat fingerprinting. ProtonVPN , which is what I use myself, includes NetShield to block trackers, ads, and malware. It doesn’t prevent fingerprinting, but NetShield can at least capture and block requests from well-known trackers to make you a bit more private online. NordVPN has a similar feature, as does Surfshark . The most robust version of this type of blocker comes from Windscribe . Through its browser extension, you can do things like rotate your browser’s user agent to make it appear as if you’re using a different browser, as well as spoof your language, time zone, and GPS information to match the VPN server you’re connected to. Again, this will not make you fully anonymous online. But an extension like the one Windscribe offers makes tracking your fingerprint more difficult.",https://www.wired.com/story/what-is-browser-fingerprinting,Technology,wired.com,Jacob Roach,"https://media.wired.com/photos/68f003a5e97d71d6bb451db5/191:100/w_1280,c_limit/browser-fingerprint-2-Jacob-Roach.jpg",2025-10-16T11:00:00+00:00,391fe430825fec1edb2319d0a56f294aad68cd62
b7b18afe8fa7,"Spit On, Sworn At, and Undeterred: What It’s Like to Own a Cybertruck","tesla, elon musk, politics, cars","Then I got my wife the Model S for Christmas. I started driving that around, and I'm like, I kind of like this. I put an order back in for the Cybertruck and I started building the excitement after that. How do you feel about it now? Oh, I love it. Now, everything else to me—and I'm not talking down on anybody else's stuff, I still love a lot of other vehicles out there—but everything else, to me, those soft lines and everything, it all kind of blends together. And the Cybertruck obviously stands out. I mean, we take the trailer out a lot, and I can go to a campground and there's 50 kids that come out: “Cybertruck, Cybertruck, Cybertruck.” I carry little toys inside the frunk so I can pass them out and give them to kids, and they love it. It's a lot of fun. Anything you don’t like about it? I can't really see the front out of the windshield because it’s so long. What’s the Cybertruck community like? When I had my Bentley and I met other people with Bentleys or Rolls-Royces, it was exclusive. They were a little standoffish to other people with other vehicles. I've learned that with Cybertruck owners, it's like, “Hey, you want to see it? Come on. You want to test drive? Come on.” They're more inclusive. What’s the biggest reaction you’ve gotten from someone while driving it? A couple of months ago, I think it was in Idaho, my son and I stopped at this place where they had a bunch of bears. It was almost infested with bears, it was kind of gross. This person literally drove through the grass, through the bears, and cut off the other cars and was behind me following me out.

80bb19d02a72,"NFL Week 7 betting: Expert breaks down underdog betting strategies, including for Vikings vs. Eagles","nfl odds, nfl betting, nfl gambling, nfl week 7 odds, nfl underdogs, nfl expert picks, nfl best bets, nfl expert best bets, nfl week 7 bets, nfl week 7 underdog bets","Week 6 of the 2025 NFL season was a rough one for underdogs with favorites running the show, but that won't always be the chaos. Will underdogs get some big wins and covers this week? Ahead of Week 7, SportsLine expert Jeff Hochman has identified two betting strategies when it comes to underdogs, with one game highlighted for each criteria. If you're looking to place NFL bets for Week 7, you need to see what Hochman has to say about these games. Pre-bye week underdogs (66.0% ATS) • Win rate: 66.0% (33-17-2) • Time frame: Since 2015 • Criteria: Home underdogs playing before bye week • Edge: Extra incentive to perform well Why this works Home underdogs heading into their bye week have been a reliable bet, posting a 33-17-2 record against the spread (ATS) since 2015, which translates to a winning percentage of 66.0%. These teams often play with added urgency, knowing they have extra time to regroup after the game. Many head coaches motivate their players by offering an extra day off if they win, and this added incentive is often overlooked in the betting line. Week 7 qualifiers (confidence level 1-5) Arizona Cardinals +6.5 vs. Green Bay Packers | Confidence: 4 This proven 66.0% ATS system for home underdogs before their bye week shows the Cardinals' exceptional home record before a bye. Arizona has an 8-3 record against the spread in pre-bye week games, including 5-1 straight up and 6-2 ATS at home. The low total enhances the underdog's value with the potential to qualify for the 69.6% extensive underdog system if the line moves to +7. The Jaguars technically qualify but lose the home-field advantage playing in London, making the Cardinals the clear system play for Week 7. The Packers present significant vulnerabilities as road favorites. Green Bay is 0-1-1 on the road this season, with its only road appearances resulting in a loss to Cleveland (13-10) and a tie with Dallas (40-40). For Packers supporters, Green Bay has a record of 3-7 against the spread in its last 10 games as road favorites, illustrating a continuing difficulty in covering outside of Lambeau Field. The Cardinals are 2-4 straight up but have shown fight in close games, losing four consecutive contests by a combined nine points through Week 6. This pattern of competitive losses indicates a team that stays within numbers (3-3 ATS), making them attractive as substantial underdogs. This total of 44 points suggests that points are at a premium. Low-scoring environments usually benefit underdogs, as fewer possessions lead to closer margins in the game. Kyler Murray is expected to return from his mid-foot sprain after missing Week 6, but Marvin Harrison Jr . is questionable while in concussion protocol. His absence could increase this line by half a point, as the public often overreacts to injuries to skill position players. NFL consistency rankings evaluate a team's reliability over time, highlighting those that perform steadily compared to those with boom-or-bust potential. Arizona ranks first in down-by-down consistency, while Green Bay is ranked 20th. Very surprising. I would expect a closer game than the line suggests. Week 7 underdogs vs. winning teams (3-2 or better) Win rate: 63% Sample size: Since 2005 Subset: 69% since 2015 (38-17-3) Best role: Home underdogs receiving less than 30% of the money Why this works In Week 7, underdogs facing opponents with a winning percentage of 60% or higher have covered the spread at a rate of 63% since 2005, averaging a margin of 1.9 points per game. This system has been particularly strong from 2015 to the present, achieving a 69% ATS record with 38 wins and 17 losses and 3 pushes. When the home team receives less than 30% of the money, the win rate jumps to 66.3% overall. Week 7 qualifiers (confidence level 1-5) Minnesota Vikings +2.5 vs. Philadelphia Eagles | Confidence: 4 As of Tuesday afternoon, the Vikings received 28% of the money. This could change, but this selection remains strong using the underdog system mentioned above. J.J. McCarthy is practicing on Tuesday; if he's active all week, he will return to action. Based on what we have seen between these two teams, the line makes no sense. My only thinking is the difference in strength of schedule, where Minnesota is ranked 30th, while the Eagles rank second. Minnesota has a better net yards per play (No. 11 vs. No. 26) and point differential (No. 8 vs. No. 19). Interestingly, both teams have struggled with third-down conversions (Philadelphia: 27th, Minnesota: 30th). However, the Eagles have struggled with third-down defense, ranking 26th, while the Vikings excel, holding the No. 2 spot. The Vikings rank higher in nine of the most useful predictive metrics. I may be missing something, but this line seems off. The betting market is giving too much respect to Philadelphia's Super Bowl pedigree and 4-2 record while undervaluing Minnesota's defensive improvements and home-field advantage. With the Vikings getting 2.5 points at home against a struggling Eagles offense, this line presents clear value. The Eagles are in the middle of a division sandwich, having played the Giants last Thursday and playing them again in Week 8. Every team will be fired up to play the defending Super Bowl champions. Minnesota has a strong home-field advantage, ranking in the top five. Kevin O'Connell has won two of three after a bye week, with the only loss by two points against Detroit last year in Minnesota. Giving offensive-minded head coaches two weeks to prepare is typically an advantage not accounted for in the line. I made this line Philadelphia -1 with a healthy McCarthy under center. You also have my permission to play the Vikings on the money line.",https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/nfl-week-7-betting-expert-breaks-down-underdog-betting-strategies-including-for-vikings-vs-eagles,Sport,cbssports.com,,https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2025/10/15/346dcccd-e3f3-4ca4-970e-8ab86ba7898b/thumbnail/1200x675/91ae9ed865799f62d0a1e8ab88d7bbf4/vikings-td.jpg,2025-10-16T11:00:35+00:00,a4612b7c1bac425fabc5c42c64a784ed7b44419b
7130f3fb2c87,Inside the web infrastructure revolt over Google’s AI Overviews,,"That's not so for many other crawlers, making Google an outlier among major players. This is a sore point for a wide range of website administrators, from news websites that publish journalism to investment banks that produce research reports. A July study from the Pew Research Center analyzed data from 900 adults in the US and found that AI Overviews cut referrals nearly in half . Specifically, users clicked a link on a page with AI Overviews at the top just 8 percent of the time, compared to 15 percent for search engine results pages without those summaries. And a report in The Wall Street Journal cited a wide range of sources—including internal traffic metrics from numerous major publications like The New York Times and Business Insider—to describe industry-wide plummets in website traffic that those publishers said were tied to AI summaries, leading to layoffs and strategic shifts. In August, Google's head of search, Liz Reid, disputed the validity and applicability of studies and publisher reports of reduced link clicks in search. ""Overall, total organic click volume from Google Search to websites has been relatively stable year-over-year,"" she wrote , going on to say that reports of big declines were ""often based on flawed methodologies, isolated examples, or traffic changes that occurred prior to the rollout of AI features in Search."" Publishers aren't convinced. Penske Media Corporation, which owns brands like The Hollywood Reporter and Rolling Stone, sued Google over AI Overviews in September. The suit claims that affiliate link revenue has dropped by more than a third in the past year, due in large part to Google's overviews—a threatening shortfall in a business that already has difficult margins. Penske's suit specifically noted that because Google bundles traditional search engine indexing and RAG use together, the company has no choice but to allow Google to keep summarizing its articles, as cutting off Google search referrals entirely would be financially fatal. Since the earliest days of digital publishing, referrals have in one way or another acted as the backbone of the web's economy. Content could be made available freely to both human readers and crawlers, and norms were applied across the web to allow information to be tracked back to its source and give that source an opportunity to monetize its content to sustain itself.",https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/10/inside-the-web-infrastructure-revolt-over-googles-ai-overviews,Innovation,arstechnica.com,,https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Co-founder_and_CEO_of_Cloudflare_Matthew_Prince-1152x648.jpg,2025-10-16T11:00:03+00:00,db2c630c52121f03495ea300ec6fa244adcc2eed

As per the ceasefire agreement , Israel was supposed to allow 600 humanitarian aid trucks into Gaza per day. However, Israel has since reduced the limit to 300 trucks per day, citing delays in retrieving bodies of Israeli captives buried under the rubble by Israeli attacks. Recommended Stories list of 4 items end of list According to the UN2720 Monitoring and Tracking Dashboard, which monitors humanitarian aid being offloaded, collected, delivered and intercepted on its way into Gaza, from October 10-16, only 216 trucks have reached their intended destinations inside Gaza. According to truck drivers, aid deliveries are facing significant delays, with Israeli inspections taking much longer than expected. ‘Palestinians want food’ While some food aid has trickled in over the past few days, medical equipment, therapeutic nutrition and medicines are still in extremely short supply, despite being desperately needed by the most impoverished, particularly malnourished children. Reporting from Deir el-Balah, in central Gaza, Al Jazeera’s Hind Khoudary said some commercial trucks have entered Gaza over the past few days, but most Palestinians do not have the ability to buy any of the items they are bringing in as they have spent all of their savings in the past two years. So far, what has arrived in the trucks includes “wheat, rice, sugar, oil, fuel and cooking gas”, she said. While food distribution points are expected to open for parcels and other humanitarian aid, people in Gaza have yet to receive them. “Palestinians want food, they want shelter, they want medicine,” Khoudary said. She added that even 600 trucks a day would be insufficient to meet the needs of Gaza’s entire population. Palestinians gather to receive food from a charity kitchen, in Nuseirat, central Gaza Strip, on October 7, 2025 [Mahmoud Issa/Reuters] Food ‘is not a bargaining chip’ The UN humanitarian chief, Tom Fletcher, has urged Israel to open more border crossings for humanitarian aid. “We need more crossings open and a genuine, practical, problem-solving approach to removing remaining obstacles. Throughout this crisis, we have insisted that withholding aid from civilians is not a bargaining chip. Facilitation of aid is a legal obligation,” Fletcher said. Since the ceasefire began, 137 World Food Programme trucks have entered Gaza as of October 14, delivering supplies to bakeries and supporting nutrition and food distribution programmes. Israeli authorities continue to block UNRWA The United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) – the primary and largest organisation providing aid to Palestinians – has faced significant restrictions imposed by Israel. The agency, which was responsible for delivering food, medical care, education and emergency assistance, says it has enough food aid in warehouses in Jordan and Egypt to supply the people in Gaza for three months. (Al Jazeera) This includes food parcels for 1.1 million people and flour for 2.1 million, and shelter supplies sufficient for up to 1.3 million individuals. However, despite the ceasefire, Israeli authorities are continuing to block them from entering. Malnutrition among children As of October 12, at least 463 people, including 157 children, have died from starvation amid Israel’s blockade of the Gaza Strip. Nearly one in four children suffers from severe acute malnutrition. After prolonged starvation, food must be reintroduced carefully under medical supervision to avoid re-feeding syndrome, a potentially fatal condition in which sudden intake of nutrients causes dangerous shifts in electrolytes, affecting the heart, nerves and muscles. A larger supply of nutritional aid, given safely, could dramatically save lives. (Al Jazeera) According to the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), 90 percent of children in Gaza less than two years of age consume fewer than two food groups each day, which doesn’t include protein-rich foods. At least 290,000 children between the ages of six months and 5 years, and 150,000 pregnant and breastfeeding women require feeding and micronutrient supplies. In addition to this, there are an estimated 132,000 cases of children less than the age of five, and 55,000 pregnant and breastfeeding women projected to be suffering from acute malnutrition by June 2026, if immediate food aid isn’t made available.

b2741dda18c9,Can Trump force India to give up buying Russian oil?,"economy, news, donald trump, energy, international trade, narendra modi, politics, russia-ukraine war, trade war, china, india, united states","United States President Donald Trump has claimed that India has agreed to stop buying Russian oil , as Washington seeks to pressure Russia to end its war in Ukraine by cutting off the Kremlin’s vital energy revenues. Trump had said he would try to persuade China to do the same. The US president told reporters on Wednesday that he had received assurances from Prime Minister Narendra Modi that India would halt its oil purchases “within a short period of time”. India and China are the two biggest buyers of Russian seaborne crude exports. Recommended Stories list of 4 items end of list Trump has sought to leverage his ongoing trade negotiations with New Delhi to pressure India over Russian oil. And, in August, he used India’s continuing imports of Russian oil as a pretext to impose additional trade tariffs on New Delhi. But Modi has so far refused to back down. For months, Indian officials have defended purchases of Russian energy as vital for India’s national security. A move by India now to stop its imports would signal a major shift by one of Moscow’s top energy customers, and could undermine Russia’s war efforts in Ukraine. Why has Russian oil been a bone of contention between India and the US? Citing India’s continued imports of Russian oil, Trump slapped an additional 25 percent trade tariff on New Delhi in August – bringing tariffs to a total 50 percent. He did not instigate similar punitive actions against China, which remains the largest importer of Russian oil, however. China imported a record 109 million tonnes of Russian crude last year, representing nearly 20 percent of its total energy imports, according to Chinese customs data. India, by contrast, imported 88 million tonnes of Russian oil in 2024. New Delhi has, therefore, accused Washington of selectively targeting India in its latest round of tariffs. Some observers argue that Trump’s stance in part reflects frustration with India’s unwillingness to acquiesce to his specific demands in ongoing trade talks. “India’s longstanding protectionist measures – such as high tariffs for agricultural goods and subsidies on pharmaceuticals – have been a point of friction in US-India trade talks,” Alicia Garcia Herrero, chief Asia Pacific economist at Natixis in Hong Kong, told Al Jazeera. By contrast, Trump has adopted a noticeably softer approach with China, avoiding similar punitive, energy-linked tariffs. Some observers believe he may be biding his time to secure a broader trade deal with Beijing that would include access to China’s rare-earth metals. Rare earths are a group of 17 elements essential to various manufacturing industries, including in the US, from car parts and military technology. China has long dominated the mining and processing of rare earth minerals and currently restricts exports of 12 of them . The upshot is that “China has much more leverage [than India], as shown by its recent export controls”, explained Garcia Herrero. The most recent of China’s export restrictions, which require foreign companies to obtain special approvals from Beijing if they wish to purchase certain rare-earth products, were introduced this week, ahead of an expected meeting between Trump and his Chinese counterpart – President Xi Jinping – later this month. In response to Beijing’s move, Trump has threatened to impose a new 100 percent tariff on Chinese exports from November 1. Still, he said his planned meeting with Xi is expected to go ahead: “I’m going to be there regardless, so I assume we might have it,” he told reporters last Friday. How reliant is India on Russian energy? Russia is New Delhi’s largest source of oil. According to Kpler, the shipping analytics company, India imported 4.5 million bpd (barrels per day) of crude in September. Of that, Russian supplies accounted for roughly 1.6 million bpd – or 34 percent of the total. That represents an eye-watering 2,250 percent increase from January 2022, one month before Russia launched its full-scale invasion in Ukraine. At the time, India was importing just 68,000 bpd of oil from Russia. Meanwhile, India is the second-largest buyer of Russian energy after China, according to data from the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air (CREA). China purchased 47 percent of Russia’s crude exports in September, followed by India at 38 percent. Why is India buying so much Russian oil now? In December 2022, several Western nations imposed a $60 price cap on Russian crude oil in a bid to reduce Russia’s ability to finance its war in Ukraine. This forced Moscow to compete more aggressively on prices if buyers wanted access to Western shipping and insurance services. But cheaper Russian oil helped narrow New Delhi’s current account deficit, which fell by 65 percent in 2023-2024 compared to the previous year. Elsewhere, Reliance Industries (RIL) – now India’s top importer of Russian seaborne crude – became the biggest corporate winner. In 2021, Russian crude accounted for just 3 percent of imports at Reliance’s Jamnagar refinery, India’s largest private facility. By 2025, that share had surged to around 50 percent, according to CREA. CREA has also calculated that the Jamnagar refinery exported $85.9bn of refined products globally from February 2022 to July 2025. Incidentally, an estimated 42 percent ($36bn) of that has gone to countries sanctioning Russia. How has India responded to Trump’s latest claim? India has not officially confirmed Trump’s claim that it has promised to stop buying Russian oil. Despite Trump’s punitive tariffs, New Delhi has consistently defended its purchase of Russian oil amid the war in Ukraine. A spokesperson for India’s External Affairs Ministry, Shri Randhir Jaiswal, reiterated that stance on Thursday. But he also hinted that India could look to diversify its import base. In an official statement, he said: “Ensuring stable energy prices and secured supplies have been the twin goals of our energy policy.

709a12233d49,"French PM Lecornu survives no-confidence parliament vote, now eyes budget","news, emmanuel macron, government, politics, europe, france","French Prime Minister Sebastien Lecornu has survived two confidence motions, just days after he appointed his new government in time to submit a draft budget to parliament in a bid to end the political turmoil that has gripped the country for months. A motion sponsored by Marine Le Pen’s far-right National Rally and its allies was defeated on Thursday, receiving the backing of just 144 lawmakers in the 577-seat National Assembly. Recommended Stories list of 3 items end of list Just moments before, a motion tabled by far-left France Unbowed gained support from 271 lawmakers, 18 short of the 289 needed for a majority. The votes followed Lecornu’s decision Tuesday to back suspending a divisive 2023 pension reform , in a bid to keep his cabinet afloat long enough to pass the much-needed 2026 austerity budget by the end of this year. The leftist Socialist Party (PS) had threatened to vote to topple the premier if he did not move to freeze the reform that would raise the retirement age from 62 to 64. After the motions failed to pass, PS lawmaker Laurent Baumel warned that sparing the premier “was in no way a pact” for the future, urging “new concessions” in the looming budget talks. Yael Braun-Pivet, president of the National Assembly and an ally of Macron, had a more positive outlook following the votes. “I am pleased to see that today there is a majority in the National Assembly that is operating in this spirit: Work, the search for compromise, the best possible effort.” Lecornu, who at the time of his first appointment last month was France ‘s fifth prime minister in less than two years, must now steer a cost-cutting budget through a deeply divided parliament before the end of the year, in what is expected to be a bruising fight. The confidence votes followed a dramatic two weeks in French politics. This vote marks a reprieve, “but he [Lecornu] is far from out of the woods yet because he has a very challenging few weeks ahead of him,” said Al Jazeera’s Natacha Butler, reporting from Paris. Lecornu now “has to try to push through a budget … that is going to please all sides of the House and for now, he’s dealing with a government that has no majority so he’s relying on [individual] MPs”, said Butler. “But as we’ve seen, there are MPs who are on the far-right, the far-left and in between who simply want to bring him down, as they say his policies are simply continuations of the French president. They are calling for new elections and they certainly don’t want to see Lecornu succeed.” Lecornu resigned last Monday after criticism of his first cabinet, only to be reappointed days later and unveil a reshuffled team in time to submit a draft budget to parliament. Under pressure from the European Union to rein in its deficit and debt, France faces an uphill battle over cost-cutting measures that felled Lecornu’s two predecessors. France’s debt-to-GDP (gross domestic product) ratio is the EU’s third-highest after Greece and Italy, and is close to twice the bloc’s 60 percent ceiling. Lecornu has pledged not to invoke a constitutional tool used to push through every budget without a vote since 2022 and pledged to put all bills to debate. “The government will make suggestions, we will debate, and you will vote,” the 39-year-old Macron loyalist emphasised in a speech to lawmakers Tuesday. But the opposition has challenged his optimism. Le Pen accused lawmakers of granting Lecornu a reprieve out of “terror of elections”, saying she was waiting with “growing impatience” for Parliament’s dissolution. The far right sees its best chance yet to take power in the 2027 presidential race, when Macron’s second and final term ends. This vote is “something of a reprieve” for Macron as well, said Butler, as “for the moment at least, his government survives. “That’s more than we can say of the picture that has been painted here [in France] over the last few months, as we’ve seen one prime minister after another in government collapse.” If Lecornu’s government were to fall in the coming weeks, “many say Macron will be under pressure to dissolve Parliament and call elections, which would likely favour the far-right, so it’s certainly something the French president would like to avoid,” said Butler. The political turmoil has also deeply affected Macron’s image both domestically, “where he is very fragile”, and internationally, said Butler, referring to when United States President Donald Trump “poked fun at President Macron” while in Egypt earlier in the week to join other world leaders in signing the Gaza war ceasefire deal. French politics has been deadlocked ever since Macron gambled last year on snap polls that he hoped would consolidate power – but ended instead in a hung Parliament and more seats for the far right.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/16/french-pm-lecornu-survives-no-confidence-parliament-vote-now-eyes-budget,World,aljazeera.com,Mariamne Everett,https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/AFP__20251016__78YB47N__v1__HighRes__FrancePoliticsGovernmentParliamentConfidence-1760612223.jpg?resize=1920%2C1440,,79aab4e03d663cdd0a2dcd99aa0851961f3c0cbc

Published On 16 Oct 2025 16 Oct 2025 Click here to share on social media share2 Share The European Commission is in discussions to adopt a new counter-drone initiative to protect European Union airspace from Russian violations, as it seeks to strengthen border security with its own advanced drone technology after a string of drone incursions were reported in a host of EU and NATO member countries over the past month. The proposal, which was included in a defence policy “roadmap” presented on Thursday, will aim for the new anti-drone capabilities to reach initial capacity by the end of next year and become fully operational by the end of 2027, according to a draft of the document. Recommended Stories list of 3 items end of list It will then be presented to EU foreign affairs chief Kaja Kallas, European Commission Executive Vice President for Security Henna Virkkunen, and European Commissioner for Defence Andrius Kubilius. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said last month that it was time for Europe to build a “drone wall” to protect its eastern flank, hours after some 20 Russian drones reportedly entered the airspace of EU and NATO member Poland . The concept has since morphed into a broader “European Drone Defence Initiative” including a continent-wide web of anti-drone systems in an effort to win support from EU capitals. The drone initiative is one of several flagship EU projects aiming to prepare the bloc for a potential attack from Russia as its more than three-year-long war in Ukraine grinds on. In the meantime, as a counterpoint, Russia’s federal security chief said on Thursday that Moscow has no doubt about NATO’s security services’ involvement in incidents with alleged Russian drones over EU territory, Russian news agency RIA Novosti cited him as saying. Following the drone incursion into Poland, other incidents were reported at airports and military installations in several other countries further west, including Denmark, Estonia and Germany, although there has not been confirmation that the drones were sent by the Kremlin. For its part, NATO has launched a new mission and beefed up forces on its eastern border, but it is playing catch-up as it tries to tap Ukraine’s experience and get to grips with the drone threat from Moscow. NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte said on Wednesday that NATO was now “testing integrated systems that will help us detect, track and neutralise aerial threats” for use on the bloc’s eastern flank. Ukrainian officials say Russia’s incursions into other countries’ airspace are deliberate. “Putin just keeps escalating, expanding his war, and testing the West,” Andrii Sybiha, Ukraine’s foreign minister, said last month after the drones were spotted in Poland. Other NATO allies have also claimed the incursions were deliberate. However, experts in drone warfare say it is still possible that the incursions were not deliberate. Russia has denied deliberately attacking any of the European countries, instead accusing them of making false allegations to cause tensions. While Brussels wants to have the drone project fully up and running by the end of 2027, there is scepticism from some EU countries and fears that the bloc is treading on NATO’s toes. “We are not doubling the work that NATO is doing; actually, we are complementing each other,” said Kallas.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/16/eu-discusses-drone-wall-to-protect-airspace-from-russian-violations,World,aljazeera.com,Mariamne Everett,https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/AFP__20251016__78ZA7WE__v1__HighRes__BelgiumEuPolitics-1760614003.jpg?resize=1920%2C1440,,92c39ac58a16e5dbaec11d3612d242e8de62daa1

The explosive device detonated while the bus, belonging to the Syrian Ministry of Energy, was travelling on a highway connecting Deir Az Zor and al-Mayadin, SANA reported in a post on X on Thursday. Recommended Stories list of 3 items end of list All four deaths were security personnel at an oil facility in Deir Az Zor, the country’s oil heartland and seventh largest city, which was the site of fierce battles against ISIL (ISIS) during the country’s ruinous civil war. Oil facility workers as well as civilians were among those who were injured in the attack, SANA added, without providing further details. A video verified by Al Jazeera from the site of the explosion showed several security personnel inspecting a bomb-damaged bus on the side of a road. According to the Reuters news agency, the security personnel were part of an army contingent securing the Teim oilfield. They were reportedly returning home after their shift at the oil facility when the explosion took place. The incident is said to be the deadliest explosion in the eastern province, which also produces most of Syria’s wheat, since the fall of longtime ruler Bashar al-Assad last December. No group has claimed responsibility for the attack. In May, a blast killed at least three people targeting a police station in al-Mayadin, a day after Syrian authorities said security forces killed three ISIL fighters and arrested four others in Aleppo. In June, authorities had also accused ISIL of being behind a deadly suicide attack in a Damascus church that killed 25 people , though the group never claimed responsibility. During Syria’s civil war, which erupted in 2011, ISIL carried out similar attacks on buses targeting the forces of al-Assad. However, since the interim government of President Ahmed al-Sharaa took power after a lightning rebel offensive, attacks on government-controlled areas have been rare. The site of the latest deadly attack also lies near an area controlled by the Kurdish US-backed Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) east of the Euphrates, where skirmishes and tensions between government forces and the SDF have risen in recent weeks. The region lies along the border with Iraq and is divided by the Euphrates River between areas controlled by the state and the US-backed and Kurdish-led SDF, which controls Syria’s oilfields east of the river. In August, Syria’s Ministry of Defence had accused the SDF of carrying out a rocket attack on a military position in northern Syria, injuring four army personnel and three civilians. Internal, external concerns for al-Sharaa The Syrian leader has been on a painstaking mission to try and unify the war-ravaged nation, making major inroads in ending Syria’s international isolation, crowned with a visit to the United Nations General Assembly last month, the first by a Syrian in six decades, where he called for an end to all sanctions on his nation. Damascus has also been attracting substantial economic investment from Gulf Arab nations, a critical economic lifeline. Deadly sectarian fighting in the southern province of Suwayda in July rocked the fledgling government, prompting it to deploy forces there to quell unrest between Bedouin tribes and Druze militias. There are also external interventionist security issues to contend with, as Israel attacked Syrian positions during that fighting under the pretext of protecting the Druze. But Israel has carried out multiple bombings and incursions into Syria both before and after that, despite ongoing security talks between the two nations. Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s vision of a “Greater Israel” , condemned by Arab and Muslima countries, involves hegemonic designs on Syrian territory, among others. On Friday, SANA reported Israeli forces conducted incursions and raids in Eastern al-Samadaniyah and Ofaniya, in the Quneitra countryside. According to SANA, the Israeli operation consisted of eight military vehicles, a heavy bulldozer, and two tanks advancing from near Tal Krum Jaba towards Eastern al-Samadaniyah, before withdrawing hours later towards the destroyed city of Quneitra in southwestern Syria, in the occupied Golan Heights.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/16/several-killed-injured-in-bus-explosion-near-syrias-deir-az-zor-state-tv,World,aljazeera.com,"Al Jazeera Staff,News Agencies",https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/AFP__20200312__1PU51C__v2__MidRes__SyriaConflictKurdsOil-1760611888.jpg?resize=1920%2C960&quality=80,,6c57bf95c89d84e0337998e4fd07c8eff1a46a96
75e4d0f0b7cd,Which countries owe the IMF the most money in 2025?,"news, business and economy, explainer, infographic, interactive, africa, argentina, asia, asia pacific, egypt, europe, latin america, middle east, ukraine, us & canada","Central bankers and financial delegates have gathered in Washington, DC this week for the annual International Monetary Fund (IMF) and World Bank meetings, which conclude on Saturday. Discussions this week have focused on global economic headwinds, as the IMF warns of signs of distress following US trade tariffs and protectionism . The IMF is widely seen as a “lender of last resort”, only stepping in when countries face severe financial crises and cannot access usual borrowing channels. Its loans, however, often come with strict conditions which can result in austerity measures and deepen social and economic hardships, making the loans a double-edged sword. What is the IMF and how does it fund itself? Founded in 1944 during World War II at the Bretton Woods Conference in New Hampshire, US, the IMF was established to help stabilise the post-war global economy. Now based in Washington, DC, it has since grown from 44 founding members to 191 today and works closely with the United Nations and other international organisations to support global financial stability. It does this by providing policy advice, short-term financial assistance and capacity development to countries and institutions. Any country can join the IMF if approved by existing members and by paying a quota based on the size of its economy, with wealthier countries contributing more. This quota is used to set how much the country contributes, how much it can borrow and how much voting power it has. How big is the IMF’s fund? Overall, the IMF has a total lending capacity of about $1 trillion. When the IMF lends money, it draws on the pooled resources of its member countries. Wealthier and more stable economies often act as creditors, supplying the funds the IMF uses to provide loans. In return, these creditor countries earn interest on their contributions. In 2024, about 50 creditor nations received approximately $5bn collectively in interest. Which countries owe the most money to the IMF? The amount of money owed to the IMF is typically expressed as Special Drawing Rights (SDRs), the IMF’s own unit of account based on a basket of five currencies – the US dollar, euro, pound sterling, the Chinese renminbi and the Japanese yen. While SDRs are not a currency, countries can exchange them for the currencies mentioned above. As of October 15, one SDR was equivalent to $1.36. The IMF currently has the highest-ever total credit outstanding. The chart below shows how much money has been owed to the IMF over the past 40 years. In total, 86 countries owe the IMF SDR 118.9 billion, roughly equivalent to $162bn. The three countries that owe the most make up almost half of the total, while the top 10 countries owe 73 percent. The chart below shows the 86 countries which owe money to the IMF, broken down by region. Argentina owes the most to the IMF, with SDR 41.8 billion (about $57bn) in outstanding credit, followed by Ukraine with SDR 10.4 billion ($14bn) and Egypt with SDR 6.9 billion ($9bn). Why does Argentina owe so much? Argentina is the IMF’s largest borrower, with its debt exceeding the combined total of the following seven countries – Ukraine, Egypt, Pakistan, Ecuador, Ivory Coast, Kenya and Bangladesh. In April, the IMF approved its 23rd programme to Argentina with a $20bn bailout programme to help prop up the economy. Argentina’s history with the IMF is marked by repeated borrowing – it is the recipient of the most bailouts in the history of the IMF. In 2018, the country secured a $57bn loan – the largest in IMF history – to address fiscal imbalances after facing a currency crisis and double-digit inflation. In October 2025, the Trump administration announced a $20bn financial support package for Argentina, aimed at stabilising the country’s economy before its October 26 midterm elections. The package includes a $20bn currency swap with Argentina’s central bank, providing US dollars in exchange for pesos to bolster the nation’s foreign currency reserves.

Ukraine’s economy tanked after Russia’s invasion in February 2022 and its external debt is now more than double what it was before the war began. The country’s total government-guaranteed debt reached $152bn by the end of April, according to the Reuters news agency, with more than 70 percent ($108.4bn) constituting external obligations. In March 2023, the IMF approved a four-year Extended Fund Facility (EFF) worth $15.5bn, which was part of a broader international support package to help stabilise Ukraine’s economy and support civilian spending and debt servicing due to the country’s high expenditure on weapons. As of October, Ukraine has received $10.6bn out of the planned $15.5bn for 2023-2027 under the EFF arrangement.

Egypt has had to borrow from the IMF on numerous occasions to stabilise its economy as a result of high debt and fiscal deficits. It has also faced shortages of foreign currency reserves and is tackling high inflation. In 2016, the IMF approved programmes under the Extended Fund Facility (EFF) for Egypt worth $11.9bn following longstanding economic issues in the shadow of the 2011 uprising, including an overvalued currency, slow growth and high unemployment. The aim of the IMF’s programme was to fix these issues via a flexible exchange rate and inflation control, raising taxes and cutting subsidies and wages. In March, the IMF approved the disbursement of $1.2bn to Egypt after completing a fourth review of the country’s $8bn economic reform programme. Egypt reported that inflation had almost halved in February, helped by financial reforms taken as part of the IMF financial support agreement.

While IMF loans run into the billions of dollars, they usually make up only a small part of a country’s total debt and gross domestic product (GDP). As a share of GDP, the countries with the most debt to the IMF are: Suriname (13 percent), Central African Republic (9.4 percent), Argentina (8.3 percent), Barbados (7.4 percent) and The Gambia (6.95 percent).

a4a3d05fb813,How Trump got his Nobel Peace Prize after all,"opinions, donald trump, latin america, united states, us & canada, venezuela","By Steve Striffler Steve Striffler is the Director of the Labor Resource Center and Professor of Anthropology at UMass Boston. Published On 16 Oct 2025 16 Oct 2025 Click here to share on social media share2 Share Although the White House immediately put the Nobel Committee on notice for putting “politics over peace” when it failed to deliver the peace prize to United States President Donald Trump, the administration had to be pleased that the award went to Venezuela’s Maria Corina Machado . Trump and Machado are cut from the same right-wing authoritarian cloth, which in part explains why the president quickly congratulated her, and why Machado, in turn, dedicated her award to him. As a leader of Venezuela’s hardline right-wing opposition, Machado has been committed to a brand of peace that has sought to undermine Venezuelan democracy and sovereignty for more than a quarter of a century. In 2002, she helped orchestrate a coup against Hugo Chavez, the democratically elected president at the time. Undeterred by failure, Machado subsequently worked to build an opposition whose primary goal has been to create enough political and economic chaos to undermine the Venezuelan government and return the country to oligarchic rule. This has included mobilising violent mobs to block streets, targeting opponents, wreaking havoc on the country’s economy, and terrorising large segments of the population. More recently, Machado’s tireless pursuit of “peace” led her to ask none other than Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, whose genocide in Gaza Machado vocally supports, to bomb Venezuela in an effort to “liberate” the country. Machado’s rise to international prominence has long been aided by Western media and political elites who frame her as a freedom fighter rather than a destabilising force. Her image has been carefully curated to appeal to the US and Europe, where right-wing populists increasingly claim the mantle of democratic renewal. By awarding her the Nobel Peace Prize, the committee has helped launder that image and reinforced the narrative that the West alone defines what counts as legitimate democracy. What is troubling about Machado being awarded the Nobel Peace Prize is not so much that the committee “got it wrong”, something it has done often enough , or even that mainstream coverage of her award has been largely uncritical. It is that, in awarding the prize to Machado, the Nobel Committee has provided an open invitation for Trump to continue, and even escalate, military intervention and gunboat diplomacy in Latin America. For Venezuela, this means violent regime change is firmly on the table. In fact, Machado herself has suggested that the attention brought by the Nobel Peace Prize might lead to increased international intervention in Venezuela, a sabre-rattling sentiment echoed by Bret Stephens in The New York Times. This should come as no surprise, given that Machado has encouraged Trump’s ongoing illegal efforts to “combat narcotrafficking”, cheered his periodic threats of invasion, and even pushed for international sanctions that have strangled the Venezuelan economy and killed hundreds of thousands of Venezuelans. That warning already appears prescient. Just this Wednesday, The New York Times revealed that the Trump administration has authorised covert CIA operations aimed at destabilising Venezuela’s government. The disclosure confirms exactly what many feared: that rewarding Machado under the banner of “peace” would embolden Washington to pursue regime change by other means. In effect, the Nobel Committee has provided moral cover for the very interventions its prize was meant to condemn. Put another way, the problem with Machado receiving the Nobel Peace Prize is not just that it makes a mockery of any meaningful understanding of peace. In the process, it embraces and validates the Trumpian sleight of hand by which violence not only becomes peace but, in so doing, becomes an effective tool for advancing an authoritarianism that is repackaged as democracy. Opponents are then cast as enemies of freedom who must be eliminated, the destruction of whom allows for a broader project that benefits the very rich while leaving working people in misery. In this sense, Venezuelan sovereignty and democracy mean as little to Machado as they do to Trump. The goal and practice of right-wing authoritarianism look much the same across the Americas. It is to ensure that political power is controlled by a wealthy elite who are free to implement long-discredited economic policies designed to facilitate the upward distribution of wealth while reducing government regulation of the natural resources and public goods that support working people. Awarding the Nobel Peace Prize to Machado, someone who puts a democratic face on violent foreign intervention and an economic war on the poor, is not just bad for Venezuela. It is deeply disturbing for the rest of the hemisphere and the world.

The New York Times first disclosed the directive, quoting US officials who privately said the administration’s strategy is focused on removing President Nicolas Maduro from power. Recommended Stories list of 4 items end of list Trump also said his administration was mulling a land attack on Venezuela, amid sharply escalating tensions after multiple US strikes on Venezuelan boats in the Caribbean Sea in recent weeks and a troop build-up in those waters ordered by the US president. Maduro appeared on national television Wednesday night, urging restraint and caution against any further escalation. “No to regime change that reminds us of the failed wars in Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya … No to coups d’état carried out by the CIA … Latin America does not want them, does not need them, and rejects them,” said the Venezuelan president in response to Trump’s announcement. So what might Trump be planning? Are his moves legal? How has Venezuela responded, and what does history tell us about what covert CIA operations in Latin America might look like? What did Trump announce? “Why did you authorise the CIA to go into Venezuela?” a journalist asked the US president at a White House news conference. “I authorised for two reasons, really,” Trump said. “Number one, they [Venezuela] have emptied their prisons into the United States of America. “And the other thing are drugs. We have a lot of drugs coming in from Venezuela, and a lot of the Venezuelan drugs come in through the sea, so you get to see that, but we’re going to stop them by land also,” he added. When asked if the CIA “had the authority to take out Maduro”, Trump demurred – refusing to rule out regime change, though not committing to it, either. “Oh, I don’t want to answer a question like that … That’s a ridiculous question for me to be given … not really a ridiculous question, but it would be a ridiculous question for me to answer. But I think Venezuela is feeling heat,” Trump added. What operations has the US already carried out? The US has carried out at least five strikes on boats in Venezuelan waters, alleging that the boats were carrying drugs, and killing a total of 27 people. The latest attack took place on Tuesday, Trump said. “Under my standing authorities as commander-in-chief, this morning, the Secretary of War, ordered a lethal kinetic strike on a vessel affiliated with a Designated Terrorist Organization (DTO) conducting narcotrafficking in the USSOUTHCOM area of responsibility – just off the Coast of Venezuela,” Trump wrote in a post on his Truth Social platform. He added that six “male narcoterrorists aboard the vessel” were killed. The first US strike on a Venezuelan boat was on September 2, killing 11 people. Two more attacks were carried out on September 15 and 19, each killing three people. A fourth strike occurred on October 3, with US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth reporting four people killed. Trump and his administration have so far not provided any evidence that these bombed boats were carrying narcotics headed for the US. Can the president launch secret or military actions without Congress? Experts have previously told Al Jazeera that US strikes on Venezuelan boats possibly broke international law and went against the US Constitution. Declared operations on Venezuelan land, whether by the CIA or the US military, would go even beyond maritime strikes in testing the legal authority of the president. Salvador Santino Regilme, an associate professor at Leiden University in the Netherlands, explained to Al Jazeera last month that the use of deadly force during maritime operations must respect the right to life and adhere to the principles of law enforcement necessity and proportionality. “UNCLOS [United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea] and the 1988 UN Drug Trafficking Convention emphasise cooperation, boarding and consent mechanisms at sea, not summary destruction. Any strike that kills suspected traffickers should trigger a prompt, independent, and transparent investigation,” Regilme said. Constitutional lawyer Bruce Fein was even more definitive in his criticism of the US maritime operations. “Any use of the military [except] in self-defence to an actual attack requires express congressional statutory authorisation. The military attack on the alleged Venezuelan drug traffickers was unconstitutional,” Fein told Al Jazeera last month. The War Powers Resolution of 1973 is a federal law that requires the US president to obtain Congressional approval before committing to war. It also mandates that the president notify Congress within 48 hours of initiating any military action. Fein told Al Jazeera that there would need to be a public vote in Congress for the approval of such a strike, and such a vote has not taken place. At the beginning of his term, Trump designated Venezuelan drug cartels as foreign terrorist organisations. In a statement to Al Jazeera in August, Fein said this designation is “illegal because [it is] contrary to the statutory standards to qualify as a Foreign Terrorist Organization “. The standards, according to the US Constitution, are that a group must be based outside the US, involved in terrorist acts or activities, and its terrorism must pose a threat to the safety of US citizens or to US national security. Trump has also repeatedly alleged that Maduro’s administration is behind the Venezuelan drug cartels that the US administration has branded “terrorist” organisations, even though US intelligence agencies have themselves said there is no evidence to back this assertion. How has Venezuela reacted? Venezuela accused the US of violating international law and the United Nations charter. “The purpose of US actions is to create legitimacy for an operation to change the regime in Venezuela, with the ultimate goal of taking control of all the country’s resources,” the government said in a statement. Maduro also rebuked the CIA’s involvement in different parts of the world, without explicitly referencing Trump’s authorisation of the CIA to carry out operations in Venezuela. Carlos Pina, a Venezuelan political scientist, said Trump’s announcement could unify Maduro’s political base domestically. “Today, the Venezuelan president once again denounced US interference in Venezuela’s internal affairs and, in particular, reinforced the anti-colonialist discourse that a large number of leftist governments and parties in the region have used in the past to oppose Washington’s influence in their own countries,” Pina said. “That said, in practical, real-world terms, Trump’s announcement will likely lead the Venezuelan government to increase its mechanisms of internal surveillance and repression – which, if left unchecked, could result in possible human rights violations.” What is the CIA’s history in Latin America? It is dirty, and while, at the moment, it is unclear what the US’s external espionage organisation plans for Venezuela, history offers clues to the nature of its operations in Central and South America and the Caribbean. From the late 1800s through the early decades of the 20th century, the US carried out a series of military interventions in Central America — the so-called Banana Wars — to protect the interests of US corporates with interests in the region. In 1934, under President Franklin D Roosevelt, the US adopted what was known as the “Good Neighbor Policy”, which in effect meant a commitment to not invade or occupy Latin American nations and to not interfere in their domestic affairs. But the US did not remain a “good neighbour” for long. Through the Cold War, in particular, the US funded several operations to unseat elected left-wing leaders in Latin American countries. Here are some instances: 1950s in Guatemala In 1954, elected Guatemalan President Jacobo Arbenz was toppled by local fighter groups backed by the CIA under the presidency of Dwight Eisenhower. Arbenz had sought to nationalise a company, stoking fears within the US of more socialist policies in the country. Under the CIA’s Operation PBSuccess, the agency trained fighters led by military officer Carlos Castillo Armas, who took power after the coup. A civil war raged in Guatemala from 1960 to 1996 between the Guatemalan government and military on the one hand, and leftist rebel groups on the other. 1960s in Cuba In 1959, Cuban communist leader Fidel Castro came to power after overthrowing dictator Fulgencio Batista. Under Eisenhower, the CIA devised a plan to train Cuban exiles to invade the country and overthrow Castro. Democratic President John F Kennedy, who won the 1960 election, was briefed about the plan during his inauguration. Castro found out about the training camps through Cuban intelligence. In 1961, Kennedy signed off on the Bay of Pigs Invasion, a plan for the Cuban exiles to overthrow Castro. However, the invasion failed when the Cuban military overwhelmed them. 1960s in Brazil In 1961, Joao Goulart came into office as president, with a mandate to pursue social and economic reforms. He maintained good relations with socialist countries such as Cuba and nationalised a subsidiary of the US-owned International Telephone and Telegraph (ITT). In response, the CIA funded pro-US politicians and supported anti-communist groups. This undermined Goulart’s leadership, culminating in a military coup in 1964, which established a US-friendly dictatorship. 1960s in Ecuador Ecuador had long been a basket case of political instability, with 27 presidents between 1925 and 1947. That, however, changed in the 1950s when the country witnessed a rare period of stability. It was not to last. By the early 1960s, the US was worried about the pro-Cuba policies of President Jose Velasco Ibarra and his Vice President Carlos Julio Arosemena, who in fact advocated even closer relations with Soviet bloc nations. The CIA, using US labour organisations as its conduits, financed the spread of anti-communist sentiment in the country. “In the end, they [the CIA] owned almost everybody who was anybody [in Ecuador],” a CIA agent told analyst Roger Morris later, in a 2004 CIA-approved appraisal of the agency’s activities in Latin America. Arosemena first staged a coup against Ibarra, and initially turned further to the left, before trying to moderate his positions. Then, in 1963, the military staged a coup against him, banning the communist party and severing ties with Cuba, aligning with US interests. 1960s and 70s in Bolivia Between 1963 and 1964, the US used covert funding, largely through the CIA, to influence Bolivia’s politics. The funding backed leaders that were friendly to the US, and supported a military coup in November 1964 led by General Rene Barrientos Ortuno against elected President Victor Paz Estenssoro. The coup was successful and forced Paz Estenssoro into exile. But the US was not done with interfering in Bolivia. By the early 1970s, Washington had eyes set on another regime change. This time, the target was President Juan Jose Torres, who had come to power in 1970 and had nationalised multiple US companies in the country. According to the US State Department’s official history , the US ambassador in La Paz, in June 1971, told Washington that it needed to support Torres’s opponents. The White House secretly sought, and received $410,000 in what critics within the administration described as “coup money” to finance military leaders and political leaders opposed to Torres. Two months later, senior military officer Hugo Banzer led a successful coup against Torres. The US continued to fund Banzer’s government, which ruled until 1978. Nearly two decades later, Banzer would return to power once again, after actually winning an election in 1997. 1970s in Chile The CIA provided funding to help end the presidency of Salvador Allende, an elected leftist leader. Allende had planned to nationalise Chilean copper companies, many of which were owned by US interests. The CIA funding was used to back Allende’s opponent and spread anti-communist sentiment. This spiralled into the 1973 military coup led by General Augusto Pinochet. Allende shot himself dead using an AK-47 rifle before he was captured: Doubts about the cause of his death lingered for decades before it was confirmed by an independent autopsy years later. The brutal US-backed dictatorship of Augusto Pinochet lasted 17 years. 1970s: Operation Condor In 1975, the CIA supported right-wing military dictatorships in six Latin American countries in setting up a transnational network of terror called Operation Condor. This began during the presidency of Gerald Ford. These countries included Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Uruguay and Paraguay. The operation was aimed at crushing political dissidents, leftists and communist sympathisers. The dictatorships used a shared database to monitor dissidents and their families across state borders. They used tactics such as exchanging intelligence, information, prisoners and torture techniques. Under the operation, at least 97 people were assassinated, according to Plan Condor, a joint initiative by Latin American organisations and the University of Oxford. 1980s in El Salvador In December 1981, the Salvadoran military’s elite Atlacatl Battalion conducted a deadly massacre in the village of El Mozote, killing about 1,000 civilians, including women and children. This was during El Salvador’s civil war of 1980-92. The battalion was trained and equipped by the US under its larger Cold War policy of suppressing leftist rebellions in Latin America. The US government greatly increased military aid to El Salvador between 1980 and 1982. 1980s in Grenada It was a familiar story by now. Maurice Bishop, the prime minister of the tiny Caribbean island, had adopted Marxist-Leninist policies after seizing power himself in 1979 when the previous premier, Eric Gairy, was out of the country. By the early 1980s, the US was worried about Cuban influence in the country. As bloody infighting broke out within Bishop’s party over a leadership struggle in October 1983, the US swooped in, invading the country, capturing Cubans in Grenada and ensuring that the country’s future was aligned with US priorities. 1980s in Panama The US invaded Panama in 1989 during the presidency of Republican George HW Bush. The invasion was called Operation Just Cause. The US underplayed the death toll and justified the invasion, saying it was carried out to remove President Manuel Noriega for alleged drug trafficking. What are the possible risks or consequences for Venezuela and the region? Pina, the Venezuelan analyst, told Al Jazeera that most other Latin American countries have so far been cautious in their response to Trump’s order and threat. Pina said there are a few exceptions to this, such as Gustavo Petro’s Colombia, and those in the regional ALBA (Bolivarian Alliance for the Peoples of Our America) bloc: Cuba, Nicaragua, Bolivia, Honduras and some Caribbean islands. He said that while an escalation like this would normally cause serious friction between Latin American governments and the US, many Latin American countries have erred on the side of caution after Maduro returned to power through a controversial presidential election in July 2024. “The current situation is due to the fact that Maduro ‘burned’ many diplomatic bridges after the presidential elections of July 28, 2024.” The election in Venezuela resulted in widespread allegations of fraud from within and outside the country. The US, which has not had a diplomatic relationship with Venezuela since 2019, and its allies did not accept the election result. In July 2024, the Carter Center and a UN panel said they could not confirm the credibility of Venezuela’s election results, stating the vote lacked international standards for fairness and democracy. Nine Latin American countries also called for the results to be reviewed by independent observers. Pina said that for the region, the most likely response is that some countries might try to act as mediators and encourage talks between Venezuela and the US to find a peaceful solution. However, at the moment, that seems unlikely, with both sides seeming “far” from reaching an agreement. He added that, for now, he expects the US to continue to put pressure on Maduro to step down peacefully, while increasing its military and naval presence – but that Maduro is likely to resist these demands. A full-fledged war will also have consequences for all of Latin America. Already, because of US sanctions on Venezuela and the economic crisis that has gripped the oil-rich nation for years, more than 8 million people have migrated from the country since 2014, mostly to other nations in the region. “If a real armed confrontation were to develop between the two sides,” Pina said, “it would likely also trigger a new wave of migration, one that, as of now, is impossible to quantify.”",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/16/trump-approves-cia-operations-in-venezuela-what-we-know-and-whats-next,World,aljazeera.com,"Elizabeth Melimopoulos,Sarah Shamim",https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/AFP__20250808__692V79U__v1__MidRes__ComboUsVenezuelaPoliticsTrumpMaduro-1758013331-1760605614.jpg?resize=1200%2C630,,e7a2f3232c369d9f7dddb4c177db8c376c450fa2

Here are a few more we like, but for one reason or another don't warrant a place above. Baseus Nomos 5-in-1 Charging Station for $100 : If you liked the PicoGo W2 above but need more gadget-charging power, this 5-in-1 could be worth a look. It also has a tilting pad and retractable USB-C cable, but adds two more USB-C ports and one USB-A, along with a stats-filled display. It’s perfect for your desktop. I also tried and quite liked the Baseus Nomos 8-in-1 Magnetic Charging Station ($80) , which combines a similar folding Qi2 pad with three US AC outlets, three USB-C ports, and one USB-A. Rapport London Formula Wireless Charging Tray for $475 : Yes, this is an obscene price for a Qi wireless charger. You can probably make a version for a fraction of the cost. But Rapport's build quality is quite nice, with a lacquered grey box and a soft-touch fabric to keep your watches and phone scratch-free. It reliably recharged several Android phones without making them too warm, all while offering storage for a few watches. It's attractive, but you have to have cash to burn at this price. iOttie iOS Wireless Duo for $60 : This dual-charging system looks pretty—I like the fabric-wrapped stand—and you can charge another device on the rubberized charging pad next to it. The stand can be used in portrait or landscape, though in the latter orientation it'll block the pad. I use the pad to top up my wireless earbuds, but I wouldn't use this iOttie on a nightstand, because the LED on the front can be glaring. A cable and adapter are included, which makes it a good value. It can charge Pixel phones at up to 15 watts, iPhones at 7.5 watts, and other Android phones at 10 watts. Samsung Wireless Charger Trio for $58 : If you have a recent Samsung Galaxy Watch smartwatch, then this is an excellent triple wireless charger to add to your home. You place the watch on the circular dip; I used it near my front door for several months, and it charged the Samsung's Wear OS-powered Galaxy Watches with zero issues. The Trio is attractive, has LEDs that light up quickly, and comes with a 25-watt wall charger and USB cable. My partner and I usually drop our wireless earbuds cases next to the watch. I don't need to be too precise—the six coils inside give you some flexibility as to where you place them. If you only need the watch charger and space for one other device, it comes in a standard pad version, too. Just remember, it only supports the models specified above. Several customer reviews mention that it does not work with older Galaxy watches. Journey Alti Play Performance Desk Mat for $120 : This is a desk mat that doubles as a wireless charging pad. On the left side is a plasticky rectangle with a Qi2 magnetic puck for your smartphone. Above it is a little area to charge wireless earbuds (5 watts). Naturally, there's RGB all over, and there are two buttons you can press to cycle through patterns and colors. It's a smart-looking system, though the quality of the actual mat leaves a bit to be desired. I didn't have issues gliding my mouse on it, and it stays put thanks to the rubber underside, but I just didn't like the look and feel of the Lycra surface. Journey has some other versions of this mat that use different materials , so take a look if you like the overall aesthetic. Anker MagGo Pad Photograph: Simon Hill Anker MagGo Wireless Charger Pad (Qi2) for $20 : This simple pad from Anker sticks well, has a durable aluminum casing that stays relatively cool, charges at up to 15 watts, and has a 5-foot USB-C cable permanently attached. You can use this charger with Qi2 Ready phones, such as Samsung's Galaxy S25 series, provided you use a magnetic phone case. Apple MagSafe Charger for $43 : Apple's MagSafe charger is quite basic. Since the charger magnetically stays attached to MagSafe iPhones, you don't have to worry about accidental misalignments causing you to wake up to a dead device. There's no charging adapter, but this is the version with the longer 2-meter cable. RapidX Modula 5 Modular Wireless Charging System for $24 : This modular system from RapidX is great for couples or families, because it is compact and can wirelessly charge two phones at up to 10 watts each. The beauty is that you can add or remove pods, and a single charging cable can power up to five. The pods snap together magnetically and pull apart for easy packing. You can buy additional phone pods and an Apple Watch pod. You only get a 30-watt US power adapter and a 5-foot USB-C cable in the box, so you will need a more powerful adapter if you plan to add pods. (RapidX recommends 65 watts or above for three or more devices.) Courant Catch:2 Essentials for $150 : Wireless chargers should look nice. You shouldn't settle for anything less! This Courant dual charger oozes luxury with its Belgian linen-wrapped surface (especially in the camel color). I've used it by my front door to recharge my partner's and my wireless earbuds for two years. The rubber feet prevent it from shifting around, but even if there are five coils in this pad, you should try to be precise when you put your device down to charge and make sure the LED lights up to double-check. It comes with a color-matching USB-C cable. Photograph: Simon Hill Zens Liberty Wireless Charger for $185 : I tested the Glass Edition of this wireless charging pad, and it looks stunning with the 16 overlapping copper coils on display (the standard version has a woolen fabric top). It can charge two devices simultaneously at up to 15 watts apiece, and there’s an optional Apple Watch add-on ($15) . As stylish as it is, the price is too high. Because you can see the coils, placement is never an issue, but it’s a bulky charger; the fan is audible at times, and while I had no problem charging my iPhone or AirPods, my Pixel 6 Pro got very warm on this pad. Xiaomi Mi 80-W Wireless Charging Stand for $50 : By far the fastest wireless charger we have tested, this stand is only worth considering for Xiaomi phones (it seems to charge most other phones at 10 watts or below). I tested with the Xiaomi 13 Ultra , which tops out at 50 watts (some Xiaomi models can go higher). The unusual sail shape combines a white triangular section with a clear acrylic base that has a subtle groove to hold your phone in place and a gap underneath for the exhaust grill from the noisy fan. The USB-C port and LED indicator are on the back. Don’t Bother They can’t all be winners. Here's a wireless charger we don’t recommend. Photograph: Simon Hill Raycon Magic Mat Pro : I love the idea of a mouse mat with a wireless charging spot for your phone, but the execution here is terrible. The spot is finicky to find, it can’t cope with thick cases, and my Xiaomi 14 Ultra would not charge at all (the camera bump is too big). Raycon says the fake leather is waterproof, but I found it a dud as a mouse mat and uncomfortable to rest my arm and hand on. Power up with unlimited access to WIRED .

Now, the company has announced a series of Copilot features coming to all Windows 11 PCs, including Voice, Copilot Vision, and Copilot Actions. Alongside the update, Microsoft is launching an ad campaign to expose people to these new features. The timing isn't an accident. Windows 10 support ended on October 14 , and we're about to see a wave of people upgrade to Windows 11 ; Microsoft seems intent on putting advanced Copilot features at the fingertips of as many people as possible—and convincing them they're worth using. It's All About Voice Courtesy of Microsoft “Hey, Copilot.” That's the wake word for the AI assistant in voice mode, now coming to all Windows 11 computers. Whether you like it or not, Microsoft wants you to start talking to your computer . The company is introducing new Copilot features across all Windows 11 devices, featuring direct voice interaction with Copilot in apps and throughout the operating system. This capability has been available on smartphones for many years with varying degrees of success, as well as Microsoft's own Copilot+ line of laptops . “It's been almost four decades since the PC changed the way you interact with it, which is primarily mouse and keyboard,” says Yusuf Mehdi, consumer chief marketing officer at Microsoft. “But what if you can go beyond that and talk to it? In our minds, voice would become the third input mechanism to use with your PC.” The push to speak directly to your PC has some data behind it. Mehdi cited Microsoft's own observations of how people interact with its PCs via voice, such as through dictation, note-taking, voice typing, and transcriptions. Mehdi also says people use the Copilot app twice as much when using voice instead of typing, due to ease of use. “People talk through their computer, they don't talk to their computer or with their computer,” he says. “But we think that's what's actually going to change a lot.”",https://www.wired.com/story/microsoft-is-rewriting-windows-11-around-ai,Technology,wired.com,Luke Larsen,"https://media.wired.com/photos/68f005c69879315923ced3b0/191:100/w_1280,c_limit/Windows%20Blog%20Hero%20Image_High%20Res.jpg",2025-10-16T13:00:00+00:00,56bb18eee7e5f22de65267c893a1778746b3c88c
01ecbfc423c0,Review: Yamaha True X Surround 90a Dolby Atmos Soundbar System,"audio, home entertainment, speakers, review, soundbars, shopping, yamaha","Another baffling omission, especially on a high-end system with surround speakers that can be placed almost anywhere: There’s no room correction. Limited Streaming Yamaha MusicCast via Simon Cohen Yamaha MusicCast via Simon Cohen Music streaming is a mixed bag, largely because of Yamaha’s limited options. The True X Surround 90A supports Apple AirPlay, Tidal Connect, and Spotify Connect, but it doesn’t work with Google Cast or Alexa Cast. It works with DLNA servers, but unlike some other Yamaha products, there’s no Roon support. I found that the MusicCast app’s native support for streaming services proved to be the most reliable high-quality option, though sadly, it’s a very limited set: Amazon Music, Qobuz, Deezer, SiriusXM, and Pandora. Bluetooth is also an option, but with only SBC and AAC codecs, it’s best for casual listening. Still, listening to lossless, hi-res FLAC tracks from Amazon Music and Qobuz was exhilarating, especially when using the All listening mode. Bottom line? Yamaha’s True X Surround 90A can enthrall you with its clarity and precision. It adds breathtaking realism to movies and shows, often revealing details that lesser soundbars obscure. Much of that performance translates to music, too, as long as you don’t mind its streaming service limitations. The fully wireless surrounds provide excellent immersion and a lot of flexibility, both in terms of placement and use as a secondary sound system. But Yamaha charges a hefty price for the True X Surround 90A, and with a big investment comes big expectations. The lack of inputs, the lack of control over the center channel level, and the absence of room correction are serious omissions. Apple Music subscribers who want to get the highest-quality audio should also note the absence of any way to get a lossless or Dolby Atmos signal to the soundbar, without the use of an intermediary device like an Apple TV 4K. That’s a lot of compromises. This makes it hard to give the True X Surround 90A an unqualified recommendation. But if you value its strengths and don’t mind its weaknesses, Yamaha’s flagship is a good, if pricey, sound addition to any TV setup.",https://www.wired.com/review/yamaha-true-x-surround-90a,Technology,wired.com,Simon Cohen,"https://media.wired.com/photos/68f079360078f51b4f545f57/191:100/w_1280,c_limit/Review-%20Yamaha%20True%20X%20Surround%2090a%20Dolby%20Atmos%20Soundbar%20System.png",2025-10-16T08:00:00-04:00,3697d60d0ce2f9bb85136f41a1ac9137210c4de6
591b820763f5,"5,000 years ago, Stone Age people in China crafted their ancestors' bones into cups and masks",,"Skull cups and skeleton masks have been discovered among a pile of 5,000-year-old discarded human bones in China , according to a new study. The sculpted skulls were found jumbled up with pottery and animal remains, but the purpose of the macabre items has so far eluded experts. These bones come from the Liangzhu culture, which included the earliest city in East Asia, according to the study, which was published Aug. 26 in the journal Scientific Reports . The collection of bones was carbon-dated to between 3000 and 2500 B.C., during China's Neolithic period . Several Liangzhu cemeteries have been discovered in the past, but none of them had sculpted bones. Archaeologists recovered more than 50 individual human bones from canals and moats at five sites that show signs of being ""worked"" — split, perforated, polished or ground down with tools. ""The fact that many of the worked human bones were unfinished and discarded in canals suggests a lack of reverence toward the dead,"" study lead author Junmei Sawada , a biological anthropologist at Niigata University of Health and Welfare in Japan, told Live Science in an email. There were no traces of the bones coming from people who died violent deaths, or signs that the skeletons had been pulled apart. That means the bones were likely processed after corpses decomposed, Sawada said. Archaeologists found four skull cups at a Neolithic site in China. (Image credit: Sawada et al., Scientific Reports ( CC BY 4.0 )) The researchers discovered that the most common worked bone was the human skull. They found four adult skulls that had been cut or split horizontally to create ""skull cups,"" and another four skulls that were split top-to-bottom to create a skeleton mask-like object. Get the world’s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox. Human skull cups have been previously recovered from high-status Liangzhu culture burials, the researchers wrote in the study, which suggests that they may have been made for religious or ritualistic purposes. The mask-like facial skulls, however, have no parallel. And other types of discarded worked bone, including a skull with perforations on the back and a lower jaw that had been purposefully flattened, are also unique. ""We suspect that the emergence of urban society — and the resulting encounters with social 'others' beyond traditional communities — may hold the key to understanding this phenomenon,"" Sawada said. A lower jawbone that was purposefully flattened around 5,000 years ago in what is now China. (Image credit: Sawada et al., Scientific Reports ( CC BY 4.0 )) Because many of the worked bones are unfinished, this suggests that human bones were not particularly rare or significantly valued, according to the study, which highlights a transformation in the perception of the dead during the swiftly urbanizing Liangzhu culture. When people no longer know all their neighbors or count them as kin, it may be easier to separate bones from the people they belonged to, the study authors suggested. ""The most interesting and unique thing about the findings is the fact that these worked human bones were essentially trash,"" Elizabeth Berger , a bioarchaeologist at the University of California, Riverside, told Live Science. Berger agreed with the researchers that the atypical treatment of the bones might be related to the increasing anonymity of an urban society. The Liangzhu culture's practice of working human bones appeared suddenly, lasted for at least 200 years based on radiocarbon dates, and then disappeared, the researchers wrote. ""The people of Liangzhu came to see some human bodies as inert raw material,"" Berger said, ""but what caused that to happen and why did it only last for a few centuries?"" Sawada said that future studies may help address these questions, particularly by helping reveal when and how people sourced the bones. These additional analyses could help the researchers tease out the meanings behind the practice and its relationship to changing social ties and kinship in Neolithic China.

1d27d0853032,Toyota to launch world's first EV with a solid-state battery by 2027 — they're expected to last longer and charge faster,,"One of the world's biggest car manufacturers has announced plans to mass-produce a type of battery for electric vehicles (EVs) that can last far longer and charge much quicker than current technologies. On October 8, Toyota and the Japan-based Sumitomo Metal Mining Company announced a joint venture to mass-produce cathode materials for solid-state batteries, to be used in the automaker’s battery-powered EVs. Toyota plans to launch a line of cars featuring the new solid-state battery in 2027 or 2028, company representatives said in a statement . Together, the companies ""aim to achieve the world’s first practical use of all-solid-state batteries "" in battery-powered EVs, the statement added. A typical lithium-ion battery has a liquid electrolyte solution sandwiched between two solid electrodes. The new solid-state battery would replace that liquid electrolyte with a third solid. Because the liquid electrolyte in lithium-ion batteries is flammable, switching to a solid-state battery comes with a lower fire risk. Solid-state batteries also have the potential for higher energy densities than lithium-ion batteries, meaning they could power a car for longer with the same size battery. Toyota and Sumitomo Metal Mining have been researching materials for solid-state batteries together since 2021. As part of the push toward a solid-state battery for electric vehicles, the two companies have developed what they describe as a ""highly durable cathode material,"" which will act as one of the electrodes in the planned solid-state batteries. Neither company has released details about the new cathode material. Get the world’s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox. Sumitomo Metal Mining plans to supply this cathode material to manufacturers beginning in 2028, a company spokesperson told Reuters . ""We will prioritize supplying Toyota, then respond flexibly to market demand,"" the spokesperson said. In addition to Toyota, carmakers such as Honda, Nissan, BMW and Volkswagen are developing their own solid-state batteries, alone or in partnerships with other companies. Many aim to release electric vehicles containing solid-state batteries in the next few years, according to Inside EVs . Honda has previously said it would begin producing solid-state batteries for EVs that could deliver 620 miles (1,000 kilometers) on a single charge by 2030. This would more than double the range of the best EVs on the market today.

cb963c003dfb,2025 MLB playoffs: How Brewers can rally from 2-0 NLCS deficit vs. Shohei Ohtani and the Dodgers,,"With Tuesday's loss to the Los Angeles Dodgers in Game 2 of the National League Championship Series , the Milwaukee Brewers now find themselves down by a 2-0 margin in the best-of-seven set. The Brewers, the team with the best record during Major League Baseball's regular season, will now have to defy overwhelming odds to advance to their first World Series since 1982. How deep of a hole are the Brewers in? MLB teams that have trailed 2-0 in a best-of-seven series have an all-time record of 15-78, according to WhoWins . That's roughly an 84% elimination rate. Of course, the Brewers needn't worry themselves with empirical data, lest this become a self-fulfilling prophecy. ""The one thing is you guys might have us counted out. And I understand that. Ninety percent of the teams that have been in this situation don't win the series. But this team has been counted out a lot this year. And I think there's some fight left in them,"" manager Pat Murphy said after Game 2. ""It will be a little tougher path doing it on the road, but we swept the Dodgers earlier in the year on the road. So at least there's some capability. I know the Dodgers weren't the same team then. But 10 times this year we've won four in a row so that's also a possibility."" How can the Brewers turn that possibility into an inevitability? Here are three keys. 1. Get into Dodgers bullpen Coming into the NLCS, I noted that the series would be determined by exposure . These teams employ contrasting approaches to their pitching staffs: the Dodgers were always going to leverage their impressive rotation to avoid their bullpen, while the Brewers were always going to do the inverse. Past studies have shown that pitchers perform worse the more often they see the same hitter, in a game or in a series, and so that effect would ultimately dictate the winner. vs. Dodgers SP 17 4 1 1 1 vs. Dodgers RP 1 1 0 3 1 So far, the Dodgers have prevailed, with starters Blake Snell and Yoshinobu Yamamoto resembling something out of Event Horizon to the Brewers lineup. Those two have combined for 17 innings of one-run ball, all the while surrendering four hits and a walk. The Brewers' pathway won't get easier, either, as the Dodgers are able to turn to Shohei Ohtani and Tyler Glasnow for starts. Milwaukee's best hope is finding a way into the Dodgers' volatile bullpen earlier in the game. That's easier said than done, of course. Unlike many of their contemporaries, the Dodgers seem willing to let their starters tackle six-plus innings each time out , even if it's out of necessity. Meanwhile, the Brewers haven't been able to generate enough traffic to lure Dave Roberts into an early hook, in part because they've played into the Dodgers' hands of making questionable swing decisions. ""Offensively you've got to grind out at-bats,"" Murphy said. ""That's been our forte. The ball-strike has been really at the core of our offensive success, and sometimes great pitching brings out the worst in you."" Somehow, be it through pitch count or run tally, the Brewers are going to have to force that decision heading forward. They have to -- have to -- make this Dodgers bullpen carry its weight if they're going to successfully push this series into a Game 6 and/or Game 7. 2. Stick to plans versus Ohtani, Betts Perhaps the most frustrating aspect of this series for the Brewers is that they've done an excellent job hampering the top of the Dodgers lineup. Shohei Ohtani will enter Game 3 wearing a 1-for-7 start, while Mookie Betts has yet to collect a hit in his first seven at-bats. The other members of the Dodgers lineup have picked up the slack, but the Brewers would've gladly taken their performance against Ohtani and Betts -- and probably would've expected to have at least split the series to date. Don't take my word for it, either. ""If I would have told you that the Dodgers were going to score seven runs in two games, and what was the outcome in the first two games, I'd say there's a chance we win one of them for sure,"" Murphy said. Coming into the NLCS, I wrote the following : ""It wouldn't be much of a departure, then, if manager Pat Murphy and the front office formulated a gameplan where Ohtani is either facing [Freddy] Peralta, a high-leverage reliever like Abner Uribe or Trevor Megill , or one of those aforementioned lefties."" Sure enough, Ohtani has taken 10 trips to the plate. He's faced Peralta, Uribe or Megill, or Aaron Ashby , Jared Koenig , or Robert Gasser in seven of those plate appearances. As for Betts, the Brewers have done a great job of ensuring he can't get too comfortable at the plate. Through the first two games, he's seen: 11 sinkers, 11 four-seamers, six changeups, four cutters, three sliders, and a curveball. They've mixed and matched and pitched him both down and away and up and in. So far, it's worked -- even if the Brewers haven't been rewarded with a win. 3. Get lucky There's no way around it. The Brewers need to catch some breaks if they're going to overcome the odds. Those can manifest in a number of ways, ranging from some fortunate hits of their own to robbing the Dodgers on some well-struck balls and beyond. I don't think it's all that likely to materialize, but one obvious possibility at hand would have Ohtani carry some of his offensive woes to the mound with him. In turn, Ohtani would have a rough, abbreviated start that could provide an opening for the Brewers. Again, I don't think it's all that likely. Ohtani has demonstrated time and again that he's mentally resilient and more than capable of compartmentalizing his game. But, if you're the Brewers, all you have right now is unconditional hope that you can win four of the next five games.",https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/news/2025-mlb-playoffs-how-brewers-can-rally-from-2-0-nlcs-deficit-vs-shohei-ohtani-and-the-dodgers,Sport,cbssports.com,,https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2025/10/15/bf8e9b6f-36a1-40e5-87a0-d5d9069477ad/thumbnail/1200x675/c61982c25f80fc3b5f22c32a4c800423/chourio-imagn.png,2025-10-16T13:34:11+00:00,24ba39180ec8b17c10d9d5e479295c98c1ba4923

ae1217def532,"Steelers vs. Bengals preview, prediction: Can Aaron Rodgers keep rolling as Cincinnati fights to stay alive?","where to watch steelers vs. bengals, steelers vs. bengals game, steelers vs. bengals kickoff, steelers vs. bengals time, steelers vs. bengals live stream, steelers vs. bengals line, thursday night football, tnf","In the Week 7 edition of ""Thursday Night Football,"" the Cincinnati Bengals play host to the division rival Pittsburgh Steelers . Cincinnati has lost four in a row since starting the season 2-0. The Bengals last week traded for Joe Flacco , who got the start last week against the Green Bay Packers but wasn't able to pull Cincy out of its slide. They need to start stacking wins, quickly, if they want to salvage their season and still be in contention if and when Joe Burrow is able to return to the lineup. Pittsburgh, meanwhile, is riding high with a 4-1 record and sits atop the AFC North with several games' worth of cushion. The Steelers came out of their bye and rather easily dispatched the Browns , and they're set up here to extend their division lead even further. The schedule toughens up a bit after this, so it's important to capture the victory before that happens. Will the Steelers continue to roll, or will the Bengals finally get back in the win column? We'll find out soon enough. But before we break down the matchup, let's take a look at how you can watch the game. Where to watch Bengals vs. Steelers live Bet NFL Week 7 games at DraftKings Sportsbook , where new users get $300 in bonus bets and three free months of NBA League Pass. When the Steelers have the ball Did you know that the Steelers are 29th in the NFL in yards per game? Look it up, it's true. They're 14th in scoring because they have the third-best average starting field position in the NFL and have rarely turned the ball over (only 5.7% of their possessions, per Pro-Football-Reference), but the underlying metrics on their offense aren't all that encouraging. They're 30th in plays per drive and 28th in yards per drive. They're 22nd in success rate, via TruMedia, 20th in negative play rate and 25th in the share of plays that gained 10 or more yards. They're 20th in third-down conversion rate and don't go for it on fourth downs. They've only kicked nine total field goals. So how on earth are they scoring? Some of it is just the Jets game in Week 1 skewing things. They've scored a touchdown on just 21.4% of their possessions over their last four games after doing so on four of their 10 non-kneeling trips in the opener. They also have five scoring drives (three of which resulted in touchdowns) that started in opposing territory. And yet! They're about to play the Bengals, who might have the worst defense in the NFL, and might be without their best defensive player in Trey Hendrickson . Cincinnati is 31st in yards allowed per game and 30th in points allowed per game. The Bengals are 30th in both EPA per play against and opponents' success rate. Opponents have scored touchdowns at the league's third-highest rate and punted at the 10th-lowest. They don't do anything well: They're 30th against the pass and 25th against the run. In other words, this Steelers offense probably doesn't need to be good in order to move the ball on Thursday night. They just need to not shoot themselves in the foot with turnovers, and that has been the single-biggest strength of this offense this season. Aaron Rodgers still takes care of the ball, and that shouldn't change against a defense that doesn't have much ammo when it comes to forcing takeaways. Pittsburgh can get some stuff going with DK Metcalf in the passing game, and everyone runs it with success against the Bengals, so Jaylen Warren and Kenneth Gainwell should be able to find some running room as well. The Steelers might not light up the scoreboard here, but they're also probably not going to struggle all that badly because the Bengals don't force anyone to struggle. A solid-ish offensive performance with a few short-ish scoring drives seems likely. When the Bengals have the ball On the surface, it might seem as though Joe Flacco breathed some life into the Cincinnati offense given that the Bengals were within one score of the Packers for a brief time in the fourth quarter, but the reality is that wasn't really the case. The Bengals were scoreless until the last five minutes of the third quarter. They also totaled just 268 yards of offense. Flacco averaged a pathetic 4.9 yards per pass attempt and the rushing ""attack"" generated 55 yards on 16 carries. Cincinnati really did not do much of anything offensively and mostly scored some garbage-time points and never threatened to actually win the game. Still, it was a marked improvement over previous weeks with Jake Browning at the helm -- mostly because Flacco managed to get out of the game without any turnovers. But that's actually out of character for him. He threw six interceptions in his four starts for the Browns this season, seven in his six starts in Indianapolis last season and eight in his five starts for the Browns the year before. He is a turnover machine. He just happened to not turn it over on Sunday. The Steelers, meanwhile, have forced turnovers on 18.4% of their opponents' possessions, according to Pro-Football-Reference. That's the third-highest turnover rate in the league. Some of that is skewed by an incredible five-turnover performance by the Patriots , but they also forced five total turnovers in their three other pre-bye games. They're coming off their first game of the season without a takeaway, but Flacco is always ripe for an interception. It wouldn't be surprising if the Steelers turned him over here. Will Ja'Marr Chase and Tee Higgins be able to get theirs on occasion against Joey Porter Jr . and Darius Slay on the outside? Probably. They're that good, and Flacco has a strong arm and is willing to fire the ball to anywhere on the field. But Flacco is also a sitting duck in the pocket and will still be working behind one of the weakest offensive lines in the league. It's not going to be easy for the Bengals to move the ball through the air. Cincinnati, meanwhile, is just a dreadful rushing offense. Chase Brown is averaging 2.7 yards per carry on the season. His runs are yielding only 0.45 yards before contact, on average, which ranks 34th out of the 37 players with 50-plus carries this season. His yards after contact per carry average (2.28) actually ranks 36th among that same group of players, so it's not like he's doing much to overcome the poor blocking he's getting up front. The Steelers are yielding 4.1 yards per carry, but the idea of the Bengals suddenly becoming a team that can successfully run the ball seems outside the realm of possibility here. Prediction Pittsburgh doesn't really have the profile of a 5-1 team given the talent level on both sides of the ball, but the schedule has broken in such a way that it feels like it's going to happen. (The Steelers got the Jets in Week 1, the Carson Wentz-led Vikings in Week 4, the Browns in Week 6 and now the Burrow-less Bengals in Week 7.) The Bengals don't have enough juice on either side of the ball to pull off the upset here.

Appearing on The Club 520 Podcast , Franklin passionately defended Branch, who lost his appeal of a one-game suspension for punching Smith-Schuster following the Lions' Week 6 loss to the Chiefs on Sunday night. ""JuJu needed his ass whooped,"" Franklin said. ""Let's just go there ... He's been needing his ass whooped for a minute. Brian Branch is doing the work of the Lord."" Branch's punch at the end of the game set off a brief scuffle between players from both teams. Lions coach Dan Campbell criticized Branch's actions, and the second-year safety admitted he acted ""childish"" after feeling provoked throughout the game. Franklin, however, saw no reason to condemn Branch. Instead, he turned his attention to Smith-Schuster, saying the veteran receiver's antics on the field have rubbed players the wrong way for years. ""[Smith-Schuster's] an asshole, bro,"" Franklin said. ""This is my thing, I'm gonna talk greasy to you. We gonna go right up. And when we get that one-on-one, I ain't gonna duck the smoke. So if I win or lose, it is what it is. He the type that's gonna do all the little weird, sneaky stuff, push you behind the back, go run to the ref ... then try to be cool with you after."" Franklin also couldn't resist clowning Smith-Schuster for how he looked after the altercation, referencing photos that circulated online showing the wideout with a bloodied nose. ""Bro, you can't be crying with your nose (bloody). You got kids, bro,"" Franklin said. ""Like, what's going to happen with your son? C'mon, bro. ... I really be feeling like, bro, I can't let y'all -- my son in the stands, I can't let you put your hands on me. My girl watching. She might like you now after this. Like, what, I'm going to tell my girl when I come home I just got my ass whooped on Sunday night."" Branch's suspension will keep him out of Detroit's Week 7 game against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers , costing him a game check and leaving the Lions without one of their most physical defenders. As for Franklin and Smith-Schuster, their next meeting might come sooner rather than later. The Colts are scheduled to visit the Chiefs in Week 12 -- a matchup that suddenly carries more intrigue than anyone expected. After Franklin's comments, that November game might also carry some bad blood.",https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/colts-zaire-franklin-defends-brian-branchs-punch-of-juju-smith-schuster-he-needed-his-ass-whooped,Sport,cbssports.com,,https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2025/10/16/d1bc4dfe-0198-421c-a830-c93c4bf03c1b/thumbnail/1200x675/7b5645fcdb7ec78371de392641ce691d/juju-smith-schuster.jpg,2025-10-16T13:11:36+00:00,99bd33911df345f29978bb23562a8b4da21a4a1b

Four of the five teams to receive first-place votes in the AP Preseason Top 25 have already loss. Three of those squads (Clemson, Texas and Penn State) have lost multiple times. Even more remarkably, Penn State fired coach James Franklin coming off a College Football Playoff semifinal appearance just a few months prior. With all that movement, some of college football's brightest stars have risen, while others have faded back into the pack. Alabama first-year starter Ty Simpson looks like the Heisman Trophy favorite after his recent tear. Meanwhile Rueben Bain Jr. is making a strong case for the No. 1 overall pick in next year's draft. With all the movement, CBS Sports expert Brockermeyer has put together a fresh list of his top 150 players. Top 150 Players at Midseason of 2025 1. Rueben Bain Jr. | Edge. | Miami ""Hurricane"" Bain has been the best player in the country this season, dominating the line of scrimmage in both phases and embarrassing his opponents weekly with a relentless blend of speed and power. He plays with a nonstop motor and is a major disruptive force for the Hurricanes. First-year starter who might be a one-and-done at Alabama, Simpson delivers an accurate ball with a strong arm, processes quickly, and can layer throws to all areas of the field. He can run effectively and plays with a killer mentality. Explosive playmaker who can stretch the field as both a receiver and a kick returner. A dynamic player with an edge, he is USC's go-to when they need a big play. He has top-end speed and is a physical receiver with excellent hands and range. Powerful runner who excels after contact, with a thick lower half, excellent feet, and strong vision. Shows good speed and the ability to separate in the open field. Has some stout defenses ahead on the schedule, making it worth watching if he can maintain his pace. Delane has elevated his play in 2025. A playmaker performing like a No. 1 corner, he shows excellent hips, fluid breaks, and exceptional ball skills. Delane plays with quick feet, strong route recognition, and body control. He has the experience and ability to excel in man coverage and is likely a top corner at the next level. Tyson is exceptional at tracking the ball in the air and shows strong contact balance after the catch to maximize YAC. He has the speed to win against press coverage and the ability to thrive in the middle of the field and in the red zone. Veteran leader who has seen it all, Beck is playing at a high level this season, taking care of the football and leading a balanced Miami offense. He reads the field well, throws a nice deep ball, and has taken fewer risks this year while remaining unafraid to check the ball down. A high-IQ player, Beck is flourishing under OC Shannon Dawson. Smith is starting to catch fire again as the Buckeyes grow more confident in Julian Sayin as the season progresses. Rare talents like Smith don't come around often; expect him to be near the top of this list by season's end. His presence on the field creates opportunities for teammates, and when he gets his chances, he delivers. 9. Sawyer Robertson, QB, Baylor Robertson leads the country in multiple passing categories and has done an excellent job protecting the football. Poised and experienced, he has a strong arm, processes quickly, and throws with precision. Could be a Tyler Shough–type in this year's draft, as NFL scouts are high on him. Mendoza reads defenses well and has the arm strength to deliver the ball on time and through tight windows. He takes what the defense gives him, processes quickly, and is athletic enough to extend plays and create on the move. 11. Arvell Reese, LB, Ohio State Off-ball linebacker who does everything exceptionally well. A rare talent and a key chess piece for an impressive Buckeye defense. Long and strong with excellent change of direction and the speed to match up against backs and tight ends. Excels at rushing the passer when given the opportunity. Twitched-out edge rusher with an explosive first step, Howell has finally put it all together in his second year for the Aggies.

Bailey is a natural pass rusher off the edge, able to win with speed and showing exceptional quickness in tight spaces. A dynamic player who can wreck a game. Currently leads the country in sacks as Tech's upgraded defense has made them one of the better teams in the country early this season.

Physical in the run game, able to displace defenders, and shows quick feet in pass protection to reach the spot and stone defenders. A leader and alpha on a very good Miami offensive line. Moore plays like a seasoned veteran, throwing an accurate ball both in the pocket and on the run. He looked calm under pressure in a hostile white-out game against a talented Penn State defense but showed some flaws against Indiana. Moore can run through defenders when needed and create plays on the move. Google his name and King's pops up. Tough and gritty player who sacrifices his body every week. Beats you more as a runner but can deliver in the clutch and throws it better than he's given credit for. A winner. Stoudt is a powerful back who uses his lower half to run over defenders and always seems to fall forward. Shows good speed and is a reliable chain mover, racking up tons of YAC and explosive runs against everyone not named Ohio State. High-IQ player and team leader who excels in both phases. Can erase tight ends and is equally effective as a run stuffer, playing in the box and making tackles in space with precision. Before his thumb injury vs. Auburn , Mateer was a top-two player in the country. He may have rushed back too early, looking a bit rusty against a tough Texas defense. The dual-threat quarterback is a winner who operates at a high level and delivers under pressure. Mateer is a weapon with his legs and a high-level processor, reading defenses and delivering the ball on time with accuracy. Trigg has had a breakout season and often plays more like a jumbo receiver than a tight end. He has natural hands and is explosive after the catch, creating mismatches in the middle of the field for a Baylor offense unafraid to air it out with multiple weapons. Tough to bring down after the catch, he runs with a powerful lower half. Excellent bend and motor, playing with flawless technique as a pass rusher. Uses his hands and hips to finish and has been one of the most disruptive players in the country. Possesses a great first step and forms one of the most feared edge tandems in college football . Reed has had a tremendous season, leading the Aggies to one of their most explosive offenses since the Manziel era. He's shown major improvement as a passer and remains a weapon as a runner, even though he hasn't used his legs as much in 2025. Haynes looks healthy for the first time in years and is playing at a high level as a shifty back with great vision, patience, and the speed to take it the distance. Possesses elite, game-breaking speed, excellent contact balance, and is a dangerous threat as a receiver. Tate is underrated nationally, with the ability to beat defenses anywhere on the field. He tracks and high-points the ball in contested situations as well as anyone in the country. A dependable, trustworthy receiver, he's a sharp route runner with strong hands who can consistently move the chains. Consistent, reliable leader. Fano plays with sound technique, excellent feet, and the ability to operate on the blindside. His best days are still ahead, but his power at the point of attack and ability to move defenders in the run game stand out.Consistent, reliable leader with good technique and footwork. Effective in the run game and poised for growth at the blindside position. Maiava has taken a big jump in 2025 after getting his feet wet last year. He has a big arm that can hit all areas of the field and extend plays on the move. A capable runner as well, he's only going to improve under Lincoln Riley. Always nice to have a security blanket in Malaki Lemmon, who will get the ball if it's in his area code. Love's production was down early this season, but he is starting to break out in a huge way as the Irish offense begins to click. He has exceptional vision and patience, is a weapon as a receiver, and is the best back in the country. Carver has been one of the most explosive receivers in the country early this season, with exceptional speed, quickness, and elite hands. He excels all over the field and has shown the ability not only to outrun defenders but also to break arm tackles. Pavia continues to improve and has changed the culture at Vanderbilt with his exceptional play and winning DNA. The dual-threat quarterback has been very accurate this year and remains a thorn in the side of every defense he faces. Love him or not, Pavia has been mostly clutch in big moments for an ascending program. Hood is very sticky in coverage and does an excellent job of tracking the ball in the air to break up passes. Underrated in run support, he shows rare physicality. One SEC team told me he was the best defensive back they've seen this season. Elusive dual-threat with a quick release and good accuracy, Williams has been very efficient this season. He throws a nice ball that can hit all areas of the field and is a real weapon as a runner, with the ability to take it the distance when he sees green grass. He has the ability to take over games. Sadiq is a fluid mover who runs like a big wide receiver, with the natural ability to catch the ball away from his body and get north. He understands how to get open and find soft spots in coverage, and is a dependable target who can be counted on to make plays. Has big-play potential after the catch and is a better blocker than you might think. Massive pickup for a team that always has impact defensive linemen. Long and strong, he has developed his pass-rushing repertoire with a blend of speed and power. Made a huge impact against Alabama, creating chaos. Great size and length off the edge has allowed him to terrorize every team he's faced this season. Shows an explosive first step and the ability to win with both speed and power. A very disruptive player with a high ceiling as a pass rusher. Anchor and leader, Brailsford plays like he's 350 pounds despite being an undersized center. He uses excellent technique and footwork, wins with leverage, pulls effectively, and loves to finish blocks. 37. Darian Mensah, QB, Duke Big-time talent who looks even better this year under OC Jonny Brewer. Accurate passer with a big arm capable of hitting the entire field.

9f95e951d871,"2025 Heisman Trophy odds, Week 8 outlook: Fernando Mendoza cements elite status, early favorites fall back","heisman odds, heisman trophy odds, heisman odds 2025, heisman trophy odds 2025, college football odds, college football betting, sports betting","To be the best, you have to beat the best. Fernando Mendoza and Indiana did so last week when they took down Dante Moore and Oregon in one of the biggest games of the Big Ten season. It was a program-defining victory for the Hoosiers in what has been an incredible rise to college football's upper echelon over the last season and a half, and it was the kind of win and individual effort that Mendoza needed to cement himself among the most legitimate of Heisman Trophy contenders. That triumph was an example of the magic that can occur in a top-25 showdown. The outcomes that occur on the biggest stages are what define each and every college football season. And, boy, Week 8 is about to be a treat in that regard. Five -- count 'em, five -- games this week pit ranked teams against each other. No. 5 Ole Miss and No. 9 Georgia meet in top-10 action to headline the slate, and both teams bring a Heisman hopeful at quarterback into the contest. A ranked rivalry battle between No. 20 USC and No. 13 Notre Dame will also feature award contenders. There is a defined top three in the Heisman race, according to FanDuel . But with a special performance in one of the myriad Week 8 marquee matchups, an outsider can very well join the mix. Heisman Trophy odds entering Week 8 QB Carson Beck , Miami (+300) QB Ty Simpson , Alabama (+320) QB Fernando Mendoza, Indiana (+430) QB Marcel Reed , Texas A&M (+1600) QB Julian Sayin , Ohio State (+1800) WR Jeremiah Smith , Ohio State (+1800) QB Gunner Stockton , Georgia (+2500) QB Devon Dampier , Utah (+2500) QB Jayden Maiava , USC (+2500) QB CJ Carr , Notre Dame (+2500) QB Trinidad Chambliss , Ole Miss (+2500) Stock up: Fernando Mendoza, Hoosiers prove they are elite Remember last season when College Football Playoff bubble teams clamored to keep Indiana out of the bracket because of its strength of record? Mendoza made sure those voices will not have a platform in 2025. The first-year Hoosier led Indiana into Autzen Stadium and slayed the Oregon dragon for easily one of the biggest wins in program history. In turn, the Hoosiers picked up three first-place votes in the AP Top 25 poll, and Mendoza improved his Heisman odds more than twofold. For Heisman winners, the lights can never be too bright. They sure have not blinded Mendoza in 2025. He is 2-0 against ranked opponents with six touchdowns and one interception in those wins over Illinois and Oregon. That came with an astounding 41-for-54 completion rate, no less. The Big Ten touchdowns leader stepped up to the plate and delivered when his team needed him the most, and that right there is a Heisman trait. Indiana quarterback Fernando Mendoza cemented his status as a Heisman Trophy frontrunner last week at Oregon. Getty Images Stock down: Dante Moore, John Mateer combine for five interceptions For every winner, there is a loser. Moore stood on the opposite side of the Indiana-Oregon showdown and turned in his least effective performance of the year. The perceived Heisman frontrunner going into the week suddenly finds himself at +3000 to receive the honor. Two interceptions in a loss will do that. The Oregon offensive line may be more to blame than Moore himself, though. He was under duress at an unfathomable rate by the Ducks' standards. It could have been worse for Moore. He could have done what John Mateer did in the Red River Rivalry. Mateer's return from hand surgery got off to a nice start. But then the Texas defense happened. No. 14 Oklahoma did not find the end zone once in its 23-6 loss to the Longhorns, and Mateer tossed three picks to bring his season total to six. In contrast, he threw seven interceptions all of last year in his breakout campaign at Washington State . This is still one of the most electrifying dual-threat talents in college football, but Heisman voters' last two impressions of Mateer were a three-interception blemish and a week off due to injury. Mateer's momentum is kaput. Don't look now, but No. 24 Cincinnati is in the Big 12 Championship picture. Sure, it may be Texas Tech's title to lose, but as long as Brendan Sorsby stays on his current pace, the Bearcats may have something to say about it. This is quietly shaping up to be a monster year for a quarterback who was not often in the same conversation as the perceived top dogs in a stacked Big 12 quarterback class. The last time Sorsby threw an interception? Week 1. The last time Sorsby had less than two total touchdowns in a game? Last season. Oh, and he went a perfect 15-for-15 against Northwestern State a month ago. It might be time to accept that this is just who Sorsby is. The people and places that made Trinidad Chambliss, Ole Miss' breakout star QB living his dreams in the SEC Shehan Jeyarajah Week 8 performances to watch If Garrett Nussmeier and Diego Pavia had not lost ground in the Heisman race over the first half of the season, this would have been among the most tantalizing quarterback matchups of this gargantuan week. They kick off the top-25 showdowns in Saturday's noon ET window. The spotlight will be brighter later in the day, though, for the following contenders. Gunner Stockton vs. Trinidad Chambliss Trinidad Chambliss is one of the best stories in the sport and has a shot at the biggest win of his young Ole Miss career. The Division II transfer has yet to throw for fewer than 253 yards in a game. Can he keep that rolling against the Georgia defense? If not, it may be Gunner Stockton's day. He could use one after a string of relatively pedestrian passing performances. Jayden Maiava vs. CJ Carr The quarterback that receives the Jeweled Shillelagh at the end of the rivalry battle between USC and Notre Dame may also climb the ladder in pursuit of the Heisman Trophy. Both have been massively efficient of late, and they combined for three 300-yard efforts in their last six outings. Carr in particular needs a win in this spot after going 0-2 against ranked opponents to start the year. Maiava is 1-1 in such games. Ty Simpson has been the best quarterback in the SEC all year. A fourth top-25 win in as many weeks would only bolster his resume, especially if he plays like he did in No. 6 Alabama's previous victories. This one carries extra weight because of the rivalry element. And don't sleep on Joey Aguilar on the Tennessee side, who could re-emerge as a dark horse if the No. 11 Volunteers reign supreme on the Third Saturday in October. Devon Dampier vs. BYU The Texas Tech disaster almost feels like forever ago for Devon Dampier. Since then, it's eight total touchdowns and back-to-back blowout wins for the Utah quarterback. He and the No. 23 Utes represent the biggest challenge to date for undefeated No. 15 BYU. With a Holy War win and a few more touchdowns, the Big 12's strongest Heisman contender can continue his rebound up the odds board.",https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/news/heisman-trophy-odds-2025-week-8-outlook-fernando-mendoza-indiana,Sport,cbssports.com,,https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2025/10/15/4ea79136-fd3f-4e1b-b544-c5606f13a368/thumbnail/1200x675/eae27cf3134abc6aa38e8f2d310f8dbd/mendoza-hoosiers.jpg,2025-10-16T13:01:29+00:00,9814c6e6c0a0d7ff9bba57f489520df6c83be0ad
34df6a368c33,Early 2026 Fantasy Baseball Rankings: Top 36 in the outfield gives prominent placement to surprise standouts,,"1 Judge isn't just the No. 1 outfielder but the No. 1 player overall, a historic power hitter who has become just as much of a standout in batting average by hitting .300 or better with 50-plus homers in three of the past four seasons. 2 Already a first-round mainstay, Soto added to his skill set with an out-of-nowhere 38-steal season. He seems unlikely to repeat it, judging from his poor sprint speed, but his work with first base coach Antoan Richardson to improve his jumps and reads is well documented. He's likely to gain some in batting average even if he loses some in stolen bases. 3 Acuna's return from his second torn ACL was a little clunky, as was also true when he returned from his first torn ACL in 2022, but we all know what followed in 2023. He turned in what may go down as the best season in Fantasy Baseball history. Mostly, we're just looking for him to regain some of his old enthusiasm for stealing bases, which seems likely given that his sprint speed remains unchanged. 4 Carroll genuinely grew into more power this past year with improved exit velocities and a career-best pull-air rate, and a late surge in stolen bases made him a 30/30 man for the first time. The one area where he's lacking is batting average, but the expected stats say he has room to improve there. 5 The line between Carroll and Tucker is razor thin, and part of me wants to side with Tucker because of his superior plate discipline (which indeed gives him the edge in points leagues) and batting average potential. Ultimately, Carroll wins out because of downside risk, with Tucker having dealt with more injuries the past couple years, but I'll note that Tucker's 2025 line is all the more impressive when you consider how much playing through a fractured finger dragged it down in the second half. 6 By now, we know better than to apply Rodriguez's typically big second half, which happened again in 2025, to his full-season projection, but just taking the numbers as they are, he's a 30/30 man who won't hurt you in batting average. That's a first-round pick in categories leagues, though Rodriguez's poor plate discipline bumps him down a round in Head-to-Head points. 7 A poor pull-air rate likely explains why Tatis continues to fall short of his expected stats, creating some separation between him and Rodriguez, at least in this scoring format. We're more likely looking at a 25-homer, 25-steal guy here than 30/30, though Tatis' improved walk rate in 2025 probably gives him the edge over Rodriguez in Head-to-Head points. 8 Chourios's 2025 only feels like a disappointment because we were hoping the big jump he made in the second half of his rookie season would sustain over his full sophomore season. His overall stat line was nearly identical, though, and doesn't require any improvement to justify this draft spot. A little extra exit velocity would do wonders for him and is still possible given that he'll only be 22 next season. 9 The most discussed player of 2025 slashed .272/.309/.559 over the first four months and then .188/.237/.295 over the final two, taking him out of the MVP conversation in real life and first-round consideration in Fantasy. On balance, he was a 30/30 man and could be again, but his high chase rate brings a volatility to his game that we just saw play out in the most dramatic way. 10 Pete Crow-Armstrong , meet James Wood , who likewise took a nosedive in the second half after seemingly establishing himself as a first-round-caliber bat in the first half. Wood's case may be even more concerning, given that his strikeout rate jumped from 26.4 percent to 39.4 percent. Then again, it was the first full season for a player with a huge prospect pedigree, and if not for the winding route he took to his final numbers, we'd be floored by them. 11 You know how I said you may need to go outside of your comfort zone to secure a potential difference-maker at this position? Buxton was certainly that in 2025, combining for nearly 70 home runs and stolen bases while ranking fifth among outfielders in Head-to-Head points per game, but it was a rare example of him remaining (mostly) healthy for a full season. The upside is clear, but so is the downside. 12 Drafting Langford this high also requires a glass-half-full approach, but it may be more palatable for him than for Buxton, given his relative youth and recent top prospect standing. The 23-year-old did take a step forward in his second season, actually bettering Jackson Chourio in home runs and stolen bases by one each, but certain aspects of his hitting profile may make him a mild liability in batting average. 13 I said Byron Buxton trailed only four outfielders in Head-to-Head points per game this past season. Believe it or not, Springer was one of them, and his 4.79 in the second half (when he hit .369) were more than Aaron Judge averaged for the season. Yes, we all thought he was cooked just a year ago, and no, you wouldn't normally bet on a career-best performance from a 36-year-old. But looking at what follows, this is as far as I can fade Springer, who, of course, has had studly seasons in the past. 14 I could elevate Bellinger by as much as three spots if I knew he'd be back with the Yankees , who offer the perfect venue for maximizing his modest exit velocities, as evidenced by his .302/.365/.544 slash line there vs. .241/.301/.414 on the road. But he's expected to enter the free agent market this offseason, and there are a whole host of venues that would be detrimental to his Fantasy value. 15 Rooker was great in 2024 but merely good in 2025, losing about a quarter of his home runs and 30 points of batting average. This happened even with him shaving nearly seven points off his strikeout rate and transitioning to what became the league's most homer-friendly park in Sacramento, so maybe you can count on him regaining some of those losses. I'm choosing to rank him more conservatively. 16 Sure, his data set isn't particularly strong. Yes, he stumbled to the finish line with a .216 batting average and .641 OPS in August and September. We've expressed similar concerns for Arozarena in past seasons, only for him to bounce back with another 20-30 homers and 20-30 steals. He's a liability in batting average, sure, but there are no perfect players at this stage of the rankings. 17 Greene has upped his home runs from 11 to 24 to 36 over the past three years, making good on his potential as a former top hitting prospect but in an unexpected way. He's a pure slugger, basically, and seems to be leaning into it all the more with escalating strikeout and pull-air rates. It's not the most versatile profile, but it's a valuable one provided your format doesn't penalize for strikeouts. 18 Suzuki did a much better job pulling the ball in the air in 2025, leading to a career-high 32 home runs, but the tradeoff was about 40 points of batting average. That second development might be the flukier of the two, though. He actually finished with a higher xBA than in 2024 and was doing fine with batting average until about midseason. It fell off even as he cut down on his strikeouts. 19 Even with improved exit velocities, Duran's production declined across the board, making it easier to say in retrospect that his monster 2024 season will likely never be repeated. Still, 2025 seemed like an overcorrection, particularly for stolen bases and, to a lesser degree, batting average. He wouldn't need to regain much to justify this price tag. 20 The consensus top prospect at the time of his promotion, Anthony enjoyed immediate success as a rookie and was beginning to tap into power, finally, when his season ended a month early due to an oblique strain. There are refinements to make with regard to launch angle and contact rate, but he already made such strides during his short time in the majors that optimism is warranted. 21 You're obviously drafting Altuve to man second base rather than the outfield -- really, it shouldn't be in question -- and the upcharge for that preferred eligibility is fairly minimal. The decline for the 35-year-old isn't as clear as some would have you believe, judging by the underlying data, but his 2025 did see him give up some batting average and stolen bases. 22 Harris did the reverse of Pete Crow-Armstrong en route to his first 20/20 season, slashing .210/.234/.317 in the first half compared to .299/.315/.530 in the second. The comparison seems apt since both are athletic marvels with considerable chase issues, which invites volatility, but seeing as Harris entered 2025 with a career .285 batting average, it's fair to presume he'll regain something there. 23 Merrill's sophomore season was partly salvaged by him hitting seven of his 16 home runs in September, but even with that late surge, the final line wouldn't warrant a pick this high. He gets some benefit of the doubt because his season was throttled by three separate IL stints, and of course, his rookie performance still speaks for itself. If he's not a base-stealer, though (swiping just one bag in 2025), it puts even more pressure on him to deliver a high batting average. 24 Cruz is no longer eligible at shortstop and no longer figures to be a Draft Day darling after batting .200 in 2025, including .185 from May 1 on and .140 over his final 37 games. He still hits the ball as hard as anyone, but he's now 27 and has made no progress with respect to the finer points of hitting. His base-stealing bails him out somewhat, and you'd be satisfied to take him here if he can bring that batting average back up to the .230-.240 range. 25 It's easy to forget about Stowers because he missed the final six weeks with an oblique strain, but the dude was one of the biggest outfield breakouts of 2025, delivering the fifth-best OPS at the position (minimum 300 at-bats) with expected stats that fully back it up. His strikeout rate raises concerns, as do his occasional sits against left-handed pitchers, but even taking those into account, this ranking is hardly aggressive. 26 There's a good chance you'll be drafting Soderstrom to man first base instead, but he's perfectly viable in the outfield as well. He's still learning to optimize his swing, seeing his fly-ball rate collapse after hitting more than one-third of his home runs in April, but he contributes to batting average as well and is only beginning to hit his stride at age 23. 27 Even with some bumps and bruises along the way, Nimmo has played in more than 150 games each of the past four seasons, which keeps his run and RBI production high in a deep Mets lineup. You can go ahead and pencil him in for a .260-24-85-85-12 line right now, and while that may seem boring to some, it's incredibly valuable at the point in the draft when he's likely to be taken. 28 Pages broke out with similar 5x5 production to Nimmo, though he isn't as proven, and his exit velocity readings are a little suspect. The walk disparity also makes for more separation between the two in points leagues. It's doubtful Pages moves up in a deep Dodgers lineup, keeping his counting stats modest, though he should still make an impact in RBI while batting sixth or seventh. 29 There may be less separating Adell from Riley Greene than these 12 spots in the rankings would have you believe, but that's only if you take the 26-year-old's breakthrough season at face value, putting aside all the futility that came before it. Adell's batting average in 2025 trailed Greene's by more than 20 points, but that advantage is reversed if you look at xBA (.273 for Adell vs. .250 for Greene). 30 Butler couldn't deliver on the hype that made him the darling pick of Fantasy Baseball analysts everywhere, reverting to his past struggles with left-handed pitchers and making contact in general. He still eked out a 20/20 campaign, but he was routinely sitting against left-handers by the end of the year. There may be hope for a rebound given his youth and athleticism, but you'll want to take a guarded approach in drafts. 31 With only small gains in exit velocity, strikeout rate, and pull-air rate, Grisham transformed himself from benchwarmer to 30-homer guy just in time for free agency. Mid-career transformations are always deserving of skepticism, but if you're presuming his power will dry up upon leaving the Yankees, given that he bats left-handed, the splits suggest otherwise. Twenty-one of his 34 homers in 2025 came on the road. 32 After staking out a reputation as a just-good-enough option for standard-size leagues, Ward took his power game to new heights, besting his previous high in home runs by 11. But there were no underlying improvement to back up this windfall -- his expected stats were virtually identical to the previous two years, in fact -- which makes me wary of drafting him as if it will continue. 33 This may seem like too steep of a downgrade for Hernandez if you just glance at the final numbers. Yeah, they were down a little across the board, but they weren't an order of magnitude different from what we've come to expect from him. You should note, though, that he did the heavy lifting in April. From May 1 on, he batted only .228 with a .678 OPS, which deserves additional scrutiny coming from a 33-year-old. 34 Marsee came up in August and immediately shook up the Fantasy Baseball world, his 3.33 Head-to-Head points per game ranking 13th among outfielders in 2025. But he fell off quite a bit in September, which should raise some alarm given his lack of prospect pedigree and modest contact quality. I trust him to work the count and steal bases, but with much to sort out still on the hitting side, I can't rank him any more aggressively than this. 35 I wouldn't blame anyone for writing off Robert after two straight disappointing seasons, but he showed genuine improvement during his last healthy stretch in July and August, focusing on letting pitches travel deeper into the zone en route to hitting .293 with an .808 OPS and 16 percent strikeout rate. Even going by his full-season numbers, he had a 162-game pace of 21 homers and 49 steals, so there's still plenty to dream on here. 36 A year later, it's still hard to say whether Profar's 2024 breakthrough was legitimate. His big August relieved concerns that it was entirely PED-fueled, but all the time he lost to that suspension still made for an inconclusive sample. His average exit velocity was closer to 2024 than the years prior, at least, and his on-base skills eventually got him hitting leadoff for the Braves , which may continue. I feel better about him in points leagues, for sure.",https://www.cbssports.com/fantasy/baseball/news/early-2026-fantasy-baseball-rankings-top-36-in-the-outfield-gives-prominent-placement-to-surprise-standouts,Sport,cbssports.com,,https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2025/10/15/c65703c6-5690-471f-b26b-222ce16dddf3/thumbnail/1200x675/852824d3662c25dfdbdbf850a042cbff/george-springer.jpg,2025-10-16T13:00:31+00:00,0265dd49f43d82a8190b11c59f5d633cb319a539

It's not the first time it's happened, but it happens at a time when we've been treading water all season. Now we're under it, and we've got to figure out a way to avoid drowning. It won't be easy, but I believe we can do it. I will not run from this. I will work harder. I will find the light at the end of the tunnel, and I will lead us to it. There will certainly be more bumps, but if we can survive an 0-6 week, we can survive anything. Unless, of course, we don't survive, and this is just the start of a never-ending free fall. Wait, no! We will not let the negative thoughts win! Positive vibes only! We've got this! Games of the Week No. 5 Ole Miss at No. 9 Georgia : These are two teams I don't have much confidence in this year, which makes it somewhat amusing that they're both ranked in the top 10. In truth, it comes down to the fact that I don't trust either quarterback much. I know Trinidad Chambliss has been a pleasant surprise, but the best defense he's faced was LSU, and it was his worst performance. I know he threw for 314 yards, but that was more volume-based, seeing as how he threw the ball 39 times and hasn't thrown it more than 29 times in any other game. That said, I like Chambliss more than I do Gunner Stockton ! I'm on the record with my belief that the Bulldogs aren't nearly as good along the lines of scrimmage as we're used to, which makes having a plucky, game-manager type at QB much more of a detriment than it has in years past. I also think Stockton is a major reason we've seen Georgia get off to slow starts in games, and that's what I'm leaning into here. Georgia has played four SEC games this season and has been outscored in the first half of those games 62-55. It trailed Tennessee 21-17 at halftime, it trailed Alabama 24-14, and it was down 10-3 at halftime (and could've been down a lot more). The only team it had a halftime lead against was Kentucky , and, well, Kentucky stinks. Ole Miss does not. To Georgia's credit, it's done a phenomenal job in the second halves of those games, but there's no reason to believe Ole Miss won't get off to a good start here. Did you watch them against Washington State last week? What is it about that performance that makes you believe the Rebels spent more time worrying about a game plan for the Cougars than they probably spent working on the Dawgs? I don't know if the Rebels will have a halftime lead, nor do I know they'll pull off another upset over Georgia, but they'll hang around through 30 minutes. The Pick: Ole Miss 1st Half +4.5 (-115) via DraftKings No. 11 Tennessee at No. 6 Alabama : A funny thing has happened to Alabama in SEC play. After playing in games that saw an average of 57.7 points in nonconference play, none of Alabama's three SEC games have seen more than 45 points scored. While Ty Simpson has continued to make big plays when needed and looks like one of the best quarterbacks in the country, on the whole, the Alabama offense has been far choppier against SEC opponents. That shouldn't come as a huge surprise, but the drop-off has been significant. They've gone from a success rate of 48.5% and 4.27 points per drive out of conference to 43.8% and 2.70 in conference. They haven't been able to run the ball nearly as effectively, even with the addition of Jam Miller . I don't know how well they'll run the ball in this matchup, nor do I know how well Tennessee will run the ball, and that could be a much bigger problem for the Vols. Tennessee fans were spiking the football over the Joey Aguilar for Nico Iamaleava swap early, and rightfully so. I still think Aguilar has performed better in this offense than Nico did, but Aguilar's come back to Earth quite a bit. His touchdown rate in conference play has been nearly halved, while his interception rate has practically quadrupled. He's been pressured far more often and has not handled it well. All of which leads me to believe that, unless there are touchdowns scored on defense or special teams, this game is far more likely to stay under the total than not. The Pick: Under 58.5 (-108) via DraftKings Lock of the Week Georgia State at Georgia Southern : Here's a line that stood out to me when it was first posted. At first glance, you may look at Georgia Southern's 2-4 record on the season and wonder why it would be favored by this much over anybody, even a 1-5 Georgia State squad. Well, it's simple: Georgia Southern's a better football team than Georgia State! Southern opened the year with road games against Fresno State and USC , and it was predictably beaten soundly. It also faced James Madison , one of the Sun Belt's best, on the road and lost by 25. Last week, it lost to Southern Miss at home by three, and Southern Miss is up there with James Madison as one of the Sun Belt's best teams. At home, this Eagles offense is averaging 40.3 points per game. Georgia State? The Panthers have scored more than 21 points in one game this season, and it was against Murray State . Against FBS competition (which has included Ole Miss, Memphis and Vanderbilt , mind you), it's averaging 14.2 points per game. I don't think the Panthers will score enough to keep up here. The Pick: Georgia Southern -6.5 (-115) via FanDuel Home Dog of the Week No. 14 Oklahoma at South Carolina : Fun little side note here. Former South Carolina QB Spencer Rattler transferred to South Carolina from Oklahoma after losing his job to Caleb Williams. On Sunday, Spencer Rattler's Saints will face Caleb Williams and the Chicago Bears. So this game can be considered something of a Spencer Rattler Revenge Weekend appetizer. That's not why I'm picking the Gamecocks to cover; I'm just amused by those games being played on the same weekend. No, the reason I'm picking South Carolina to cover is that the Gamecocks have one of the best pass rushes in college football , and Oklahoma still has one of the worst offensive lines in college football. I firmly believe the Gamecocks can get pressure on John Mateer and force him into the same kinds of mistakes we saw last week against Texas . I believe this because those Mateer mistakes were nothing new. The only thing different last week was that Texas' defensive backs didn't drop the interceptions like Michigan and Auburn did. I don't see either one of these offenses doing much of anything, which makes the under an enticing option as well, but what pushes me more toward South Carolina is a trend that's hard to ignore in the SEC. There have been 21 SEC conference games played on campus this season, and the home team is 14-6-1 ATS in those games. As an underdog, the home team is 4-1-1. It pays to bet the home team in SEC play so far. The Pick: South Carolina +5.5 (-110) via Draftkings Team Total of the Week Wyoming at Air Force : Listen, not every bet is fun, all right? Sometimes, when you're suffering, you need to subject yourself to even more suffering to find the release of joy. That's what we're doing here, because betting on Wyoming's offense isn't an exciting proposition. Unless you consider betting on an offense that ranks 121st nationally in points per possession, 102nd in success rate and 106th in explosive play rate to be a great time. I don't, but we're playing the matchup here. As bad as Wyoming's offense is, Air Force's defense is even worse. Like, horrifically worse. Think of the worst movie you've ever seen, and it's a better movie than Air Force's defense is a defense. The Falcons opened their season by holding Bucknell to 13 points. They haven't allowed fewer than 34 since, and that was against Navy , which ran up 517 yards of offense and did more to stop itself in that game than anything. Air Force ranks dead last in the country in points allowed per possession at 3.69. They have allowed explosive plays on 18.16% of snaps they've faced, which also ranks dead last. The 8.1 yards they allow per play? You guessed it, the worst in the country. But, don't worry, their defensive success rate of 54.0% ranks 120th, so it's not all horrific! The Pick: Wyoming Team Total Over 26.5 (-125) via FanDuel Upset of the Week Purdue at Northwestern : Here's the thing about Purdue. It's not very good, but it's not horrible, either. We saw a glimpse of that last week when the Boilermakers went on the road to face Minnesota and were in that game until the end, even leading after three quarters. They hung around with Illinois and USC, too. They were only embarrassed by Notre Dame . According to FPI, the Boilermakers have played the 16th most difficult schedule in the country, and they've hung tough most of the time. Northwestern's a much easier matchup. Yes, the Wildcats have won three straight. They're the last team to beat UCLA , and they got James Franklin fired last week. However, last week's upset was more about Penn State beating itself than Northwestern beating it. Don't get me wrong, this Northwestern team isn't nearly as bad as last year's squad was, either, but I like Purdue's offense better. If the Boilermakers are able to turn this game into a shootout, they've got a much better shot of winning this game than they're getting credit for. Also, while Purdue's defense hasn't been great, Northwestern's not a bad matchup for them. Beware the Boilermakers on Saturday.

87937f78642c,Blue Jays smash their way back into ALCS; Ranking the NBA's 25 best under 25,,"This is an article version of the CBS Sports HQ AM Newsletter, the ultimate guide to every day in sports. You can sign up to get it in your inbox every weekday morning here . ⚾ Five things to know Thursday The Blue Jays got on the board with a blowout win over the Mariners. With the Mariners bringing a 2-0 ALCS lead back to Seattle, T-Mobile Park was rocking, but it didn't stay that way for long. Toronto's bats mashed five homers en route to a 13-4 win . We have a series now. Lions DT Alim McNeill is set to make his 2025 debut on Sunday. McNeill has yet to play a down this season after tearing his ACL last December, but that should change this weekend. As Dan Campbell put it on Wednesday, McNeill is ""freaking playing"" against the Buccaneers. A disruptive force in the middle of the defensive line, McNeill's return will be a major boost. Tua Tagovailoa has apologized to his Dolphins teammates for his bizarre postgame press conference. Tagovailoa faced a lot of criticism -- from inside and outside the team facility -- for publicly calling out teammates about their attendance in players-only meetings. Tagovailoa has since apologized , saying his ""intent was right,"" but can he really put that toothpaste back in the tube? Russell Westbrook is signing with the Kings. Westbrook will now suit up for his seventh team in his 18th NBA season after inking a deal with Sacramento . Westbrook may not be the MVP-caliber player he once was, but he'll give the Kings some nice depth at point guard after finishing seventh in Sixth Man of the Year voting with the Nuggets last season. The Orioles have expressed interest in Albert Pujols as their next manager. The three-time NL MVP is garnering quite a bit of interest on the MLB manager carousel. Pujols has already interviewed for the vacant Angels gig , and the Orioles are reportedly eyeing him for their opening . The 45-year-old Pujols is coming off a Dominican Winter League title with Escogido in his managerial debut. 💪 Do not miss this: Blue Jays slug their way back into ALCS Getty Images After laying an egg (pun intended) in the first two games of the ALCS at home, the Blue Jays needed to show signs of life in Game 3. Well, their vital signs look just fine from where I'm sitting. After falling behind 2-0 in the bottom of the first, Toronto's bats woke up, and the team smacked the cover off the ball. Five different players -- George Springer , Vladimir Guerrero Jr. , Alejandro Kirk , Addison Barger and Andres Gimenez -- hit home runs as the Blue Jays ran away with a 13-4 win to make it a 2-1 series. What was the key to the Jays' offensive resurgence ? As Mike Axisa explains, it was their ability to jump all over Mariners starter George Kirby 's fastball. Axisa: ""Toronto put 11 balls in play against Kirby's fastball and the average -- average -- exit velocity was 94.2 mph. That includes two doubles and two homers. The Blue Jays were all over Kirby's heater after too many swings resulted in weak contact in Games 1 and 2. It was like someone flipped a switch. In the third inning, Toronto's offense finally locked in."" 💸 Ballooning buyouts in college football Adam Eargle, CBS Sports The best job in America, maybe the world, is a fired college football coach. No one gets paid more (millions) to do less (nothing), and the price tags have skyrocketed in recent years. Less than one year after taking Penn State to the College Football Playoff, James Franklin was shown the door on the heels of consecutive losses to Oregon , UCLA and Northwestern . On his way out the door, Franklin will cash a $49 million check, the second-largest buyout in college football history. Our own Brandon Marcello took a deep dive to find out what's behind these ballooning contracts and buyouts in college football. Sometimes, these gargantuan deals stem from one thing: Fear. The higher-ups at these schools are scared to miss out on -- or lose -- the hottest names in the sport. Marcello: ""For athletic directors, one bad hire can end a career. Reputation is the currency. That's why, as one search-firm executive put it, 'It's not the president or board's money. If a president, board and AD make an elite hire that turns the program around, no matter what it costs, that's going to help the public's perception of their ability to do their jobs.'"" As the money continues to explode ( nine coaches are set to make at least $10 million in 2025), here are the biggest buyouts in college football today: 1. Kirby Smart , Georgia ($105.1 million) 2. Lincoln Riley , USC ($80+ million) 3. Ryan Day , Ohio State ($70.9 million) 4. Mario Cristobal , Miami ($61 million) 5. Kalen DeBoer , Alabama ($60.8 million) Most of those coaches are relatively safe at their current gigs, but these nine coaches are feeling the heat . At least the severance packages will be quite generous. 🏀 Who are the NBA's best 25 under 25? Getty Images Our NBA Top 100 players list was released on Tuesday, but we have another list that's just as interesting. Adam Finkelstein captured a snapshot of the league's future in his 25 under 25 ranking . It's hard to beat the combination of youth and skill, especially when it means cheaper contracts in the present and a bright future down the road. Every player on this list has both of those, and one of them already has a ring. Mentioned in the same ballpark as Victor Wembanyama and Anthony Edwards , Thunder star Jalen Williams comes in at No. 6 after helping Oklahoma City win its first NBA title. His ability to accept a role and play it to the best of his ability is invaluable, according to Adam Finkelstein. Finkelstein: ""SGA may have been the MVP, but Williams was just as valuable to OKC's championship run. His versatility, two-way impact, and consistent improvement are all widely acknowledged, and rightfully so. Beyond that though was his toughness to play through injury and unselfishness to buy into his role and not allow any fraction or dissent to be formed around role allocation."" Here's a little taste of the top 10 -- that's called a tease, folks. 6. Jalen Williams, Thunder 7. Chet Holmgren, Thunder 8. Amen Thompson, Rockets 9. Evan Mobley, Cavaliers 10.

e9c87e199da6,State of the third base position for 2026: Junior Caminero leads thin third base class,,"What's the state of third base heading into the 2026 offseason? I won't beat around the bush: It's bad. How bad? In 2025, Zach McKinstry and Lenyn Sosa were both top-12 finishers at the position. And it's not like either was great – McKinstry was an All-Star but struggled mightily in the second half, while Sosa finished with 22 homers and just 132 combined runs and RBI. It was a bad season at the position, and it's actually even worse than it appears, with long-time stalwart Rafael Devers heading into 2026 with just first base eligibility in CBS Fantasy leagues. Fellow top-10 3B Jorge Polanco will also be losing eligibility, as will the likes of Colson Montgomery and Sal Stewart , who provided a nice little boost to the position down the stretch. That's not to say this position is a total wasteland. There are plenty of high-end stars out there if you want to shore up the position early on. If you don't want to follow that path, there are still upside options to target, whether you want to bet on an Austin Riley , Mark Vientos , or Royce Lewis bounceback or a breakout from someone like Jordan Lawlar or Matt Shaw , neither of whom took advantage of their opportunities in 2025. But if you skip those first few rounds, you're going to be taking on a risk. There are few sure things here, and some of the apparent sure things are getting up there in age. We really need some of those younger guys to step up to solidify the hot corner – especially because, as you'll see later in this newsletter, there aren't a lot of reinforcements coming from the minors, either. For more on third base, check out Scott White's top-20 rankings for both Roto and H2H here , and you can find my way-too-early rankings for every position here . 2025 Third Base Review Jose Ramirez , CLE: .283 - 103 - 30 - 85 - 44 Junior Caminero , TB: .264 - 93 - 45 - 110 - 7 Eugenio Suarez , SEA: .228 - 91 - 49 - 118 - 4 Manny Machado , SD: .275 - 91 - 27 - 95 - 14 Jazz Chisholm , NYY: .242 - 75 - 31 - 80 - 31 Rafael Devers, SF: .252 - 99 - 35 - 109 - 1 Maikel Garcia , KC: .286 - 81 - 16 - 74 - 23 Jorge Polanco, SEA: .265 - 64 - 26 - 78 - 6 Jose Caballero , NYY: .236 - 52 - 5 - 36 - 49 Lenyn Sosa, CHW: .265 - 57 - 22 - 75 - 2 Matt Chapman , SF: .231 - 76 - 21 - 61 - 9 Zach McKinstry, DET: .259 - 68 - 12 - 49 - 19 According to FanGraphs' Player Rater tool, there were just seven third basemen who returned at least $10 in value in 2025. That's the fewest of any infield position, including catcher! And, as noted earlier, one of those seven won't actually be third base eligible for 2026. It's rough out here. Biggest Breakout from 2025 Junior Caminero, Rays That went just about as well as anyone could have hoped. You could quibble and hope for better than a .264 batting average from a guy who makes as much contact as Caminero does, but 45 homers, 93 runs, and 110 RBI from a rookie are pretty incredible numbers. And hey, the low-ish batting average gives you hope that there's room to grow. Caminero managed just a .260 BABIP, but it's not like that was just a fluke – his expected batting average was just .269, just about right in line with what he managed. The issue? Caminero has a very loose launch angle spread, which basically means he hits the ball at extreme angles that aren't conducive to production. His barrel rate – batted balls hit at a more or less optimal launch angle and exit velocity – was 14%, nearly twice the league average. That's great for hitting for power, as is his 97.7 mph average exit velocity on fly balls and line drives, the 10th-highest mark in the league. However, he also had a higher share of his batted balls defined as either ""pop-ups"" or ""topped,"" per BaseballSavant.com , and there's very little production to be found there. And you see it in Caminero's expected stats – his .359 xwOBA was very good, but not quite as good as you would expect for a guy who hits the ball as hard as he does and strikes out less than 20% of the time. That mark was up to .400 over his final 250 plate appearances, and if he can sustain that, he's going to take another step forward. As good as he was in 2025, there's still some meat left on those bones. Biggest Bust from 2025 Austin Riley, Braves Once might be an aberration, but two down seasons in a row is a lot harder to ignore. I was mostly willing to give Riley the benefit of the doubt for his poor showing in 2024, in large part because it was mostly just due to a slow start, as Riley more or less looked like himself for the final couple of months before his season came to an early end. With the underlying numbers mostly where you expected them to be, optimism coming off 2024 made sense. I think it's harder to make that case for 2025. For one thing, Riley was worse in 2025 than in 2024, and it wasn't just the surface-level numbers; his quality of contact held mostly steady, but Riley's plate discipline (never a strength) collapsed. His zone contact rate fell from 81.3% to a career-worst 78.1%, leading to a 28.6% strikeout rate and 6.0% walk rate, his worst marks since his rookie season in 2019. Maybe he was still dealing with lingering effects from the right hand fracture that ended his 2024 campaign, though it's hard to square that with the fact that Riley's best months of the season were actually April and May. He didn't get better as the season progressed in the way teammate Ozzie Albies did, which makes it harder to buy that as an explanation. Riley will be 29 shortly after Opening Day, and while that's not so old that you would necessarily expect him to be on the decline, it's not so young that we should bet on a bounceback, either. Biggest rankings movers from 2025 to 2026 Up: Junior Caminero, Rays; Eugenio Suarez, Mariners ; Isaac Paredes , Astros ; Maikel Garcia, Royals We'll get to Suarez when we talk about pending free agents, so let's take a moment to appreciate what Paredes managed this season. Back in a park more well-suited for his pull-heavy swing than Wrigley Field ever was, he put up some of the best numbers of his career. He played just 102 games but was on a 33-homer, 85-run-85 RBI pace before a hamstring injury in July effectively ended his season. That's pretty much exactly what we were hoping for from him, because it's pretty much exactly what he did in Tampa before being traded to the Cubs . As long as he plays in a park with a short fence in left field, Paredes is going to be a very good Fantasy option. And he might just be an underrated one yet again. After enjoying eligibility at second base, third base, shortstop, and the outfield in 2025, Garcia will enter 2026 as just a third baseman. But if he's as good as he was in 2025, that plays at any position. Garcia has always had excellent plate discipline and better-than-you-think power, but he took both to another level this season. He cut his strikeout rate to 12.6% while improving his expected wOBA on contact from .331 to .358. He started elevating the ball more consistently, and while he still has the problem of hitting the ball harder on the ground than in the air, he makes enough contact to overcome that. There probably isn't too much more he can squeeze out of his current skill set, but the nice thing about Garcia is that if the bat does take a step back, he did steal 37 bases in 2024, so there are other ways for him to contribute. Down: Austin Riley, Braves; Mark Vientos, Mets ; Luis Rengifo , Angels Let Vientos serve as a bit of a cautionary tale for your favorite ""Big power, bad plate discipline"" breakout. Ironically, Vientos actually saw more fastballs and pitches in the strike zone in general in 2025 than he did in 2024, and he actually managed to cut his strikeout rate from 29.7% to 24.8%. But he made them pay for those pitches less, with his xwOBA on contact dropping from .444 to .403. But, if you look under the hood, Vientos doesn't look that much different from his successful 2024 version. His expected wOBA dropped from .331 to .325, which isn't nothing, but it doesn't explain why he was such a disappointment. This does: He went from overperforming his xwOBA by 25 points in 2024 to underperforming by 22. His aggregate production over the past two seasons has him right in line with his overall xwOBA, and it would see him hit .250/.305/.464 with a 31-homer pace … and you know what, that's not so bad. There are playing time concerns for Vientos, but if you don't expect him to be what he was in 2024, you could get a very nice power-hitting corner infielder for what should be a steep discount. As for Rengifo … yeah, we just whiffed on this one. I mean, sure, he took a gigantic step backwards from 2024 and suffered through his worst season since 2021, but it's not like we had a ton to actually get excited about here. He overperformed his expected wOBA by 40 points in 2024 and randomly became a high-volume base-stealer out of nowhere despite mediocre speed. He'll hit better than his .238/.287/.335 line in 2026, I'll bet, but not by enough to be anything more than a bench flier in Fantasy drafts. Offseason preview Who needs an upgrade most? The Red Sox and Mariners are listed here because they are the current home of the two biggest free agents. Alex Bregman will opt out of the remaining two years of his contract to head into free agency again, this time looking for the long-term deal he couldn't find last offseason. He'll be turning down at least $40 million (and up to $80 million) by opting out. Eugenio Suarez is the other big free agent, and he'll be looking for one more big deal after getting traded to the Mariners. He has struggled since the trade – just like he struggled the first time he was in Seattle – and while the culture and clubhouse fit seems great from the outside, you have to wonder if the Mariners might not be better off passing on him in free agency to find a better fit for their ballpark. The Pirates need help everywhere, the Athletics have multiple holes to fill if they want to take a step forward, and the Tigers got away with a platoon at third but would likely prefer to have something a bit more stable at the corner. And then there's the Phillies. This high-priced, star-powered team has largely fizzled out in the playoffs in recent years, and the core isn't getting any younger. Alec Bohm has never been much more than fine at his best, and now he's nearing 30 and getting more expensive. Would they be better off trying to find a legit impact bat for that spot? Could they dip their toes into the Bregman/Suarez sweepstakes? Or are they pretty much at their spending limit? Top impending free agents Alex Bregman* Eugenio Suarez Miguel Andujar Munetaka Murakami** Kazuma Okamoto** *Has an opt-out **Likely to come over as a free agent from Japan Bregman is coming off a bounceback season, though one that looked a lot better before a quad injury derailed his season. Bregman is no longer a superstar as he nears his early 30s, but he's a very solid all-around hitter and Fantasy option – though landing somewhere like the Cubs or Tigers probably wouldn't help his value, given their home parks and the particulars of his pull-heavy swing. Suarez is just a bad fit in Seattle. He has played 195 career games at T-Mobile Park and is hitting just .211/.311/.406 there, with an untenable 31.2% strikeout rate. He'll be heading into his age-34 season, with the risk that implies, and returning to Seattle would probably be enough to push him out of the top 12 at the position for me. If he lands pretty much anywhere else, he'll be a target. However, expecting him to flirt with 50 homers again is probably asking too much. He's a strong source of power and a big batting average risk, and there's always a chance the bottom completely falls out sooner rather than later, given the inherent swing and miss in his game. The rest of the free agent crop is pretty bad, but you probably need to know about Murakami and Okamoto. Murakami is a two-time Central League MVP in Japan, and he won the Triple Crown in 2022, when he broke Sadaharu Oh's single-season record for home runs by a Japanese-born player with 56. He struggled to live up to that level in his next couple of seasons, but was a dominant force yet again in 2025, hitting .286/.392/.659 in a league where the average OPS was just .652. He carries significant swing-and-miss issues with him – a 27% strikeout rate compared to 19.5% as the league average – and there are real questions about whether he'll be able to handle major-league heat (and whether he'll be able to stick at third base long term), but given the relative lack of other appealing options, he seems like a worthwhile dice roll as a 25-year-old free agent. Okamoto is a few years older than Murakami, at 29, and his highs haven't been quite as high in Japan either. But he also doesn't bring quite as much strikeout risk while still looking capable of hitting for power, with a career-high of 41 in 2023 and 248 in his NPB career. FanGraphs.com's scouting reports give him a better hit tool than Murakami, with less power, though still above-average. He'll likely get a significantly smaller contract than Murakami and come over with less hype, but if he signs somewhere he could start, he'll be a name to know for the later rounds. Trade candidates Arenado seems like the one sure thing to be moved, and he acknowledged he'll ""have to be"" more open-minded to being traded this offseason than he was last. That's noteworthy because Arenado rejected a trade to the Astros, one of the few spots where his pull-heavy swing could still play. He's still an excellent defender at the hot corner, but Arenado's bat has slipped a ton, and he hit just .237/.289/.377 with 12 homers in 107 games last season. He still has two pretty expensive seasons left on his contract, so the market for his services is likely to be pretty limited unless the Cardinals are willing to take on more. Landing in Boston as a cheaper alternative to Bregman might be the best possible outcome for Arenado, though the Red Sox' bevy of cheap, young talent might make it tough to justify that kind of move from their perspective. Top 2026 rookies to know It's not great down in the minors, either. There will certainly be players who shift down the defensive spectrum to third, of course, and one obvious name to know who isn't listed here is JJ Wetherholt , who could slide into the spot vacated by Arenado whenever the Cardinals do move on from him. Wetherholt has enough glove to stick at shortstop long term, but he's nowhere near the defender Masyn Winn is, so sliding to the hot corner would make some sense. Wetherholt hit .314/.416/.562 as a 22-year-old at Triple-A this season and looks like he should be a strong source of batting average with the upside to hit 20 homers and steal 20 bases at his best. I'll also acknowledge here that, while Condon was drafted as a third baseman, he's actually listed as an outfielder on CBS Fantasy and has primarily played first base in the minors so far.

Coming out of Week 6, I look like I jumped into the ring with prime Mike Tyson after taking my fair share of licks. Last week's slate concluded with a 5-10 record against the spread and a 10-5 record straight-up. That brought me to an even 15-15 with my locks of the week, a 41-52 ATS record and a 57-35-1 record straight-up. We'll certainly take the moneyline wins, but we need to be better against the number, and I expect we will as the season goes along. That tide should hopefully turn this week, with several intriguing revenge narratives lurking in my five locks of the week.

I don't love this spot for the Patriots, who are playing their third road game in as many weeks. They are also facing a Titans team playing their first game after firing head coach Brian Callahan , which is typically a situation where clubs respond well the following game. That said, is Mike Vrabel really going to lose his first game against a Tennessee franchise that fired him after the 2023 season? The Patriots head coach should be dialed in for this matchup, and I expect the players in the locker room will also be motivated to win this game for Vrabel. New England is also far superior -- it's playing like a top-10 team in the NFL at the moment -- with Drake Maye putting up top-five numbers at the quarterback position.  On the other side, Cam Ward has struggled as the No. 1 overall pick: he has a league-worst 55% completion rate and ranks bottom three in the league in yards per attempt (5.5) and touchdown-to-interception ratio (3-to-4). Going up against a New England defense that is 3-0 and allowing just 17.3 points per game since All-Pro corner Christian Gonzalez returned, it could be another long day at the office for Tennessee. Projected score : Patriots 30, Titans 17 The pick : Patriots -7 Sunday, 1 p.m. (Fox | Fubo , try for free) I think Caleb Williams is going to be particularly motivated for this game against New Orleans and, more specifically, Spencer Rattler . This will be the first time these former Oklahoma quarterbacks will face one another since their position battle with the Sooners. Rattler started over Williams to begin the 2020 season, but Williams eventually got the nod during the sixth game of that campaign. Williams started the rest of that year, and Rattler eventually transferred to South Carolina. Williams admitted in 2024 that he was ""so angry"" starting the season as the backup to Rattler at the time, and I wonder if that feeling will linger in this game with a desire to continue to prove that he was the top quarterback in that room. On top of the motivation factor from Williams, I like the way Chicago is playing. It has won three straight coming into Week 7 and is averaging 2.4 takeaways per game (most in the NFL). That should match up well against Rattler's Saints, with the quarterback 0-5 on the road as the starter and his offense averaging just 11.8 points per game. Meanwhile, Williams is 7-3-1 ATS at home in his career. Projected score : Bears 27, Saints 20 The pick : Bears -4.5 Sunday, 1 p.m. (Fox | Fubo , try for free) It's hard for me to back the Eagles at this stage, particularly on the road. The offense continues to look lost and is averaging just 274.5 yards per game (third-fewest in the NFL). The club has been outgained in every game this season and has been outscored 52-17 in the last five quarters. This offense is expected to rebound against a Vikings defense that is fifth in the NFL in points per game allowed (19.4), sixth in yards per game allowed (289.8), and second in third-down efficiency (30%)? I don't see it. Meanwhile, the Vikings are 9-2 at home since the start of last season, which includes a 2-0 record as a home underdog. The club is 4-1 straight-up as an underdog since 2024. Projected score : Vikings 23, Eagles 20 The pick : Vikings +1.5 Sunday, 1 p.m. (Fox | Fubo , try for free) The Jets initially opened as the favorite in this matchup, but the odds have swung toward Carolina. While it's hard to fault anyone for fading the Jets after an abysmal performance in London last week, this is a sneaky good spot for them to notch their first win of 2025. The Panthers are a dramatically different team on the road than they are at home. This season, Carolina is 0-3 on the road and is averaging just 15 points per game on offense while allowing 31.7 points per game on defense. Bryce Young is just 1-15 on the road in his career as a starter. If this continues, Justin Fields won't be asked to do anything beyond his capabilities as a passer, and New York could control a low-scoring game. After all, the Jets did play well on defense and on special teams last week, to the point where they nearly pulled off the upset despite issues on offense. Those two areas could continue to shine, and if they get remotely competent play from Fields and Co., it'll result in the first win for head coach Aaron Glenn. Projected score : Jets 20, Panthers 17 The pick : Jets +1.5 Don't look now, but the Kansas City Chiefs have clawed back to .500, the offense is coming alive, and the team is set to welcome back standout receiver Rashee Rice from his six-game suspension. K.C. has gone 3-1 since beginning the year at 0-2 and takes on a Raiders team that hasn't impressed at all this season, despite bringing in veteran quarterback Geno Smith and respected head coach Pete Carroll. Smith has an NFL-high 10 interceptions and the offense is averaging just 17.2 points per game (29th in the league). That won't be good enough against a Chiefs offense that is starting to heat up and is getting a key weapon back in the fold. That's also not mentioning Patrick Mahomes ' 12-2 record against the Raiders in his career. I expect Kansas City to cover the double-digit spread.

The Western Conference looks miles better than the East with the likes of superstars Jayson Tatum and Tyrese Haliburton expected to miss this season. Milwaukee tried to stay competitive sans Damian Lillard by eating the remaining $113 million of his deal via waivers and signing Myles Turner. Giannis Antetokounmpo will have to play at an MVP level for the Bucks to hang in the East provided he's not traded. Lillard returned to Portland but won't play this year. Incidentally, the past seven NBA MVP winners have been born outside the United States: Greece's Antetokounmpo (twice), Serbia's Nikola Jokic (thrice), Cameroon's Joel Embiid and then Canada's Shai Gilgeous-Alexander of the Thunder last season. I find an American to be the best value this year; James Harden in 2018 (Houston version) was the last USA winner.

Reportedly, all rookies will wear an NBA debut patch on his uniform that will be removed after play and put onto an autographed, numbered rookie card. Last season's MVP (Gilgeous-Alexander), Rookie of the Year (San Antonio's Stephon Castle) and Defensive Player of the Year (Cleveland's Evan Mobley) will have a Gold NBA Logoman patch placed on their uniforms, which will be removed after play and inserted into rare trading cards. I have picks for all those awards this year but subbed in Most Improved Player for Defensive Player of the Year because the Spurs' Victor Wembanyama (-180) seems all but a sure thing to win it if he doesn't get hurt again. The 7-foot-4 shot-blocking demon was the runaway favorite for DPOY at last season's All-Star break but wasn't able to play after due to deep vein thrombosis. The 2023 first overall pick is good go to for his team's opener in Dallas next Wednesday. That's must-see TV with Wemby vs. Flagg. MVP pick: Jalen Brunson, Knicks (+10000, FanDuel ) I certainly don't rule out Gilgeous-Alexander but like Heisman Trophy winners, NBA MVPs generally have to exceed their previous season's numbers to repeat and I'm not sure SGA can do better than 32.7 points per game on 51.9% shooting from the field, 6.4 assists per game and 5.0 rebounds per game. I do quite like Antetokounmpo to have a big season and he's pretty good value at +1100. But the Bucks might not be very good -- and as noted, Antetokounmpo might be traded. Because I like the Knicks to win the watered-down East, why not take Brunson at this terrific number? He just led New York to the Eastern Conference Finals for the first time since 2000. Playing more games against a watered-down East while MVP contenders in the West have to face much tougher competition can only help Brunson's cause. Voters already love him as Brunson won the NBA's Clutch Player of the Year for 2024-25. And that was while he was playing under a defensive-minded head coach in Tom Thibodeau. New head coach Mike Brown should bring in some modern offensive concepts to put Brunson in position to be even more efficient. Rookie of the Year pick: Cooper Flagg, Mavericks (-170, DraftKings ) This price is obviously too short for much value, but Flagg is such a cut above the rest of the rookie class. The only way he doesn't win is if the No. 1 overall pick misses a ton of games with an injury. Note that players aren't required to play 65 regular-season games to be eligible for Rookie of the Year, unlike other major awards. I'm just not sure I see another rookie who will contribute as much to a potentially good team. The No. 1 overall pick won ROY in 2023 (Orlando's Paolo Banchero ) and in 2024 (San Antonio's Wembanyama), but it went to No. 4 overall pick Castle of the Spurs last year. While a handful of clubs have had back-to-back Rookies of the Year, no team has had three in a row. San Antonio's Dylan Harper , the No. 2 overall pick this year, is +1000. But he won't even start most games as a rookie with De'Aaron Fox and Castle in the backcourt. Harper is raw, while Flagg is much more polished. Most Improved Player pick: Amen Thompson, Rockets (+900) This recommendation is 100% a result of Fred VanVleet's season-ending injury for Houston, as arguably no player will benefit more from playing time and having the ball in his hands than the 22-year-old Thompson, the No. 4 pick in the 2023 draft. With the departures of Dillon Brooks and Jalen Green to Phoenix in the Kevin Durant trade, Thompson was expected to take on a larger role even before the injury. As it was, Thompson took a massive step forward last season in his sophomore campaign, raising his scoring from 9.5 PPG as a rookie to 14.1, his rebounding from 6.6 to 8.2, his assists from 2.6 to 3.8 and his blocks from 0.6 to 1.3. If he makes a similar third-year jump, Thompson will likely not only win this but be named an All-Star for the first time. The 6-foot-7 Thompson is already an elite defender and made the All-Defensive first team in 2024-25.",https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/2025-26-nba-awards-odds-picks-cooper-flagg-clear-rookie-of-year-choice-longshot-jalen-brunson-steals-mvp,Sport,cbssports.com,,https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2025/10/15/b0a4d254-09aa-450e-b255-55d882ffedb7/thumbnail/1200x675/7c6d769c55057f1b8bd3c74d77e36eab/flagg.jpg,2025-10-16T12:01:02+00:00,6de2e43de340f5ac51c59d5c225864b767c4774a
3a28f827ca42,"Peacock’s John Wayne Gacy Drama ‘Devil in Disguise’ Is a Tasteful, Considered Take on the Sensationalized Serial Killer: TV Review",,"Seven years ago, the second season of the Ryan Murphy-produced anthology series “American Crime Story” dramatized “The Assassination of Gianni Versace,” but the name was something of a misnomer. In the telling of screenwriter Tom Rob Smith, the story began with the namesake killing, but it worked backwards from there to profile the other, much less high-profile victims of Versace’s killer Andrew Cunanan. The bait-and-switch was a powerful rejoinder to how history has largely erased Cunanan’s victims, all of whom were other gay men, who didn’t happen to found a successful fashion brand. In 2023, the HBO docuseries “Last Call” made a similar argument about how homophobia shapes the public memory of, and police response to, serial killers who prey on marginalized groups. Working within a true crime industrial complex that tends to fetishize monstrous murderers and idealized victims (preferably white, female and middle class), these shows swam against the current to elevate the lives lost over the man who took them. They lived within a larger subgenre  — one might deem it “anti-crime” — that includes works like “The Investigation,” the Scandinavian drama that refused to even name the killer of Swedish journalist Kim Wall, and the oeuvre of documentarian Liz Garbus, whose work on the Gilgo Beach and University of Idaho murders also centered the victims. But “Assassination” and “Last Call” took on a specific valence by focusing on gay men, whether contorted by the closet’s pressures into violent criminals or ignored by a society that didn’t value their safety. At first glance, the Peacock series “ Devil in Disguise: John Wayne Gacy ” seems inspired by another Murphy project. (The scripted project is not to be confused with the 2021 docuseries “John Wayne Gacy: Devil in Disguise,” which also aired on Peacock. Besides a near-identical name, the shows share an executive producer, Liz Cole.) Much like the Netflix hit “Monster,” which kicked off with a Jeffrey Dahmer-focused season in 2022, “Devil in Disguise” intends to inaugurate a seasonal anthology by piggybacking on the notoriety of a Midwestern, well, monster — a latter-day bogeyman so notorious their last name alone is synonymous with gore. The Dahmer edition of “Monster” shared some themes with “Last Call” and its ilk, but hewed closer to more typical Murphy sensationalism. “Devil in Disguise,” by contrast, is pointed and deliberate in its deconstruction of Gacy’s image, which almost singlehandedly cemented the archetype of the killer clown in American culture’s shared subconscious. The series quickly situates itself in the “Assassination” and “Last Call” school of thought, applying the same lens to an even higher-profile example. Showrun by Patrick Macmanus, a veteran of such scripted true crime shows as “Dr. Death” and “The Girl From Plainville,” “Devil in Disguise” is principally distinguished by what it doesn’t show the viewer, who’s likely familiar with at least the broad outlines of the case. We never, for example, get a head-on look at Gacy (Michael Chernus) in his clown getup. We never see Gacy actually kill his victims — just sparing, oblique hints of the lead-up and aftermath to a select few of his 33 documented murders, all young men. And when Gacy stands trial late in the eight-episode season, we never see any courtroom testimony. We don’t need to; the guilty verdict and eventual death penalty are already predetermined. “Devil in Disguise” fills the ensuing space with the victims and the families they left behind. The series begins with the disappearance of Gacy’s final victim, suburban Chicago teenager Rob Piest (Ryker Baloun), abducted from his place of work while his mother Elizabeth (Marin Ireland) was waiting in the car. Local detective Rafael Tovar (Gabriel Luna) and his boss Joe Kozenczak (James Badge Dale) make relatively short work of pinpointing Gacy, in part because the contractor did such a poor job of covering his tracks; multiple witnesses saw him speaking with Piest before his disappearance, and a prior conviction for sodomy only further raises suspicions. Once the jig is up, Gacy can’t stop talking, inviting cops into his home and helpfully pointing out where he’s hidden the bodies. The ease of Gacy’s eventual arrest makes for a gut-wrenching contrast with the dozens of human remains found in his crawl space. If Tovar and Kozenczak found him so quickly, why had no one else bothered to in the preceding six years? The story alternates the investigation and prosecution that uncover the full extent of Gacy’s crimes with flashbacks that give the victims, after one or two of whom each episode is named, a face and a background. Some are kids just starting to explore their stigmatized sexuality; some are sex workers; some are dismissed as troublemakers; some are just looking for honest, well-paying work. In many cases, “Devil in Disguise” doesn’t even show them interacting with Gacy, letting the audience fill in the gaps between their final moments onscreen and the terrible fate that befell them soon after. This approach achieves the desired emotional effect, decentering Gacy while driving home the human cost of law enforcement hamstrung by their own bias and a lack of modern technology like shared databases. Ireland does typically excellent work as a grieving mother, moving from distraught panic to quiet fury to resigned acceptance as the season progresses. At times, though, “Devil in Disguise” verges on pedantic, as when a repentant Kozenczak admits “I’m realizing that I have blind spots.” The structure can also be repetitive — not in the contents of the specific flashbacks, which communicate the victims’ individuality, but in the expected pivot from the present to its context. As for Gacy himself, Chernus is sparing with overt menace. The actor is best known for supporting roles as comic buffoons in shows like “Severance” and “Orange Is the New Black,” a quality that suits Gacy’s pathetic need for approval and overplayed Midwestern folksiness. (“It’s colder than a witch’s itty bitty titty out here!”) His goal, and the show’s, is to cut Gacy down to size from the stuff of legend to an ordinary, if awful, man, beholden to such mundane influences as his father’s judgement and internalized bigotry. “He was killing off bits of himself that he hated — that his father hated,” is one psychologist’s straightforward read of Gacy’s motivation. This analysis arrives just halfway through the season, once again running into the issue of length and redundancy. To put some distance between Gacy and the viewer, “Devil in Disguise” uses his lawyer Sam Amirante (Michael Angarano) as a kind of intermediary. Amirante, who knew Gacy through the local Chicago community before agreeing to represent him, is an odd choice of character to elevate to such prominence. His inner conflict over representing a man he knows to be guilty isn’t especially compelling when held up against the cumulative loss of life. Rather, Amirante comes off like a way for the show to observe Gacy up close without fully inhabiting his perspective. In that sense, at least, he serves his purpose, offering a front-row seat to Gacy’s compulsive lying and relentless self-delusion that lends some credence to Amirante’s ultimately unsuccessful insanity defense. Even with these bumps in the road, however, “Devil in Disguise” maintains a clarity of purpose that grounds the show throughout. There’s a well-articulated sense of why we’re revisiting one of the most picked-over, thoroughly covered killing sprees of the 20th century, and what the series wants to say about the people and events it depicts. That quality is missing from so much true crime it’s worth praising, whatever flaws emerge in the telling. All eight episodes of “Devil in Disguise: John Wayne Gacy” are now streaming on Peacock.",https://variety.com/2025/tv/reviews/devil-in-disguise-john-wayne-gacy-review-peacock-1236553092,Entertainment,variety.com,Alison Herman,https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/NUP_205701_00861.jpg?w=1000&h=563&crop=1,2025-10-16T13:30:00+00:00,1ec545e7bc540da8ec83af4c9c0c26e053897076
f5bb304b1009,‘The Age of Disclosure’: Documentary Revealing Government Cover-Up of Non-Human Intelligence Sets Release in Theaters and on Amazon Plus New Trailer,,"“ The Age of Disclosure ,” Dan Farah ‘s buzzy documentary that aims to establish that we’re not alone in the universe, is finally making its way to the masses. The film will have an Oscar-qualifying run in select theaters in New York and Los Angeles beginning on Nov. 21 along with a concurrent release on Amazon Prime Video . Additionally, a new trailer for the film was released on Thursday. Per the official description, “The Age of Disclosure” documents “an 80-year global cover-up of non-human intelligent life and a secret war among major nations to reverse-engineer advanced technology of non-human origin. Featuring testimony from 34 members of the U.S. Government, military and intelligence communities, the film exposes the profound stakes for the future of humanity.” One of the key voices in the film is Jay Stratton, former Defense Intelligence Agency official and director of the government’s UAP Task Force. As seen in the trailer, he says, “I have seen, with my own eyes, non-human craft and non-human beings.” Farah, a debut feature director, spent three years making “The Age of Disclosure” in secrecy, seeking out sources with direct knowledge of the government’s work around UAPs (unidentified anomalous phenomena, the more formal term for UFOs). Among the interviewees are high-ranking politicians from both the Democratic and Republican parties, such as secretary of state Marco Rubio and senator Kirsten Gillibrand, as the congressional hearings about UAPs  and the proposed UAP Disclosure Act have seen major bipartisan support. “The Age of Disclosure” has had significant word-of-mouth momentum behind it all year even without a public distribution plan; the initial trailer quickly reached more than 20 million views across YouTube and social media when it was dropped in January leading up to the film’s premiere at SXSW in March. Farah directed and produced “The Age of Disclosure” via his Farah Films banner. Relentless Releasing serves as distributor. See the new trailer below.

Under the official tile of “BFI and Chanel Filmmaker Awards: Celebrating Creative Audacity” the 2025 awards for rising British talent were chosen by a jury made up of Tilda Swinton, Edward Enninful and BFI chief executive Ben Roberts. The winners this year includes writer/director Harry Lighton, whose debut feature “Pillion” bowed in Cannes, Sandhya Suri, whose narrative feature debut “Santosh” was the U.K.’s official selection for the Oscars in 2024, and The Neurocultures Collective — made up of Sam Chown-Ahern, Georgia Bradburn, Benjamin Brown, Robin Elliott-Knowles, Lucy Walker — and artist-filmmaker Steven Eastwood, behind “The Stimming Pool” docufiction film that released to acclaim earlier this year. Selected for “creative audacity and ambition to explore a new dynamic to their practice,” each of the three award winners will receive financial support of £20,000 ($27,000) in order to help them “expand their work and explore new ideas, cultivate co-creation and knowledge exchange, and widen the representation of voices in today’s cultural community.” The awards were presented at an event held at London’s Claridge’s Hotel where, alongside the winners and jury, guests included Imogen Poots, George MacKay, Connor Swindells and one of Variety ‘s latest 10 actors to watch list, Jay Lycurgo. “Once again, a highlight of the year for my fellow jurors and I: a glimpse, not only of phenomenally impressive projects achieved, but, even more excitingly, of groundbreaking new voices proposing new perspectives that widen the cinematic landscape and promise enlightening and inventive horizons ahead,” said Swinton. “We are enormously proud of this prize and the opportunity it gives us to offer encouragement and support for each of these distinctly original artists at what we feel sure is the beginning of their audacious and nourishing life’s work.” Added Roberts: “We are thrilled to continue our partnership with Chanel and award these unique awards to some of the U.K.’s brightest filmmakers. This year’s winners have all made startling and moving films, and we hope this award offers them the space and freedom to continue to take risks and be audacious in the next steps of their careers.” The BFI and Chanel Filmmaker Awards have been running since 2022.

ddeabf8ae152,CNN to Launch Streaming Subscription Tier for $6.99 Per Month,,"CNN is ready to enter the streaming era…again. The Warner Bros. Discovery-backed news outlet said it would launch a new “All Access” subscription product for $6.99 per month, or $69.99 per year, starting October 28. The company billed the new service as the best way to interact with a burgeoning suite of new content built for audiences using mobile devices or connected TVs. Subscribers who sign up by January 5, 2026 can get the annual plan for a special introductory price of $41.99 for the first year. “With this new subscription offering, our audience will now have access to the best of CNN across platforms, including multiple live stream channels, our signature video-led journalism and all articles on CNN.com and in the mobile app,” said Alex MacCallum, executive vice president, digital products and services, CNN Worldwide, in a statement. “It’s an essential step in CNN’s evolution as we work to give audiences the complete CNN experience in a format that reflects how audiences engage with the news today.” The new launch is emblematic of CNN CEO Mark Thompson’s continued efforts to push CNN, a mainstay of traditional television into a new age even as news junkies increasingly turn to non-traditional video sources for both quick-hit information and in-depth reportage. The maneuver is crucial. Unlike many of its rivals, CNN has yet to develop a sustainable digital-video product. And while it experiments, competitors like NBC News and CBS News have launched content offerings that can be found everywhere from Amazon’s Fire portal to YouTube. Subscribers to “All Access” — the product builds on a “basic” subscription tier that allowed for unlimited reading of articles on CNN and its mobile app, along with some subscriber-only content — will be able  to stream a selection of CNN’s live U.S. and international programming; a library of CNN original series and documentaries; new content from CNN journalists; and exclusive live events. CNN said it would disclose a  full schedule and content at launch. In some ways, the new concepts echo one of CNN’s biggest recent initiatives: The company in 2022 debuted CNN+, a subscription-based streaming hub that executives said represented the best way to capture die-hard viewers with a mix of lifestyle and news programming that relied on personalities including Wolf Blitzer, Kate Bolduan and Kasie Hunt. Within a month of its launch, the service was shut down by CNN’s new parent corporation . CNN unveils the launch as its parent company, Warner Bros. Discovery., readies itself for a split of its assets, with CNN being placed amid other traditional cable networks. As such, a streaming CNN product that was previously available on the company’s Max streaming hub is being removed, and there will likely be new considerations of whether to bundle it with other broadband offerings from the new corporate entity.",https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/cnn-streaming-subscription-launch-6-99-per-month-1236554428,Entertainment,variety.com,Brian Steinberg,https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/CNN-Broken-Illustration-Full.jpg?w=1000&h=563&crop=1,2025-10-16T13:19:39+00:00,035ac07bacc99417c68652b062d0b1ed72632862
c75c8bea3965,CBS News’ Standards Chief Exits Amid Chaotic Period for News Division (EXCLUSIVE),,"Claudia Milne , who has overseen standards and practices at CBS News since 2021, announced her departure from the Paramount Skydance unit Thursday morning, becoming the first senior executive to exit since the arrival of digital Bari Weiss as editor in chief and the naming of a former Trump adviser as an ombudsman placed the news division under intense scrutiny. “We live in complicated times. For our company, for our industry and for our country. And it’s times like this that what we do matters most,” Milne said in a farewell note to colleagues. “I believe our role as journalists is to hold the powerful to account. We are here to question and challenge our political leaders on behalf of our audiences, Republican or Democrat, liberal or conservative…we must interrogate the social media companies that want to control our attention, the businesses that manage our healthcare and the institutions that shape our education system… and So. Much. More.” She added: “I encourage you all to keep asking those tough questions, challenge those in authority and keep informing the audience. And I know that you will continue to do it in the fair, balanced and unbiased way that this organization always has and is the bedrock of good journalism.” Her announcement comes as CBS News staffers have been put under a microscope following Paramount’s decision to put the direction of newsgathering under the aegis of Bari Weiss , a digital opinion entrepreneur whose company, The Free Press, has captured attention among conservatives and political-opinion aficionados, but who has no experience running a mainstream media organization. Weiss reports directly to David Ellison, Paramount’s new CEO, while the president of CBS News, Tom Cibrowski, is working alongside her to put initiatives into practice. CBS News has endured months of chaos. Some of its shows, such as “60 Minutes” and “Face the Nation,” have been the subject of complaints from the Trump administration, and two different groups of Paramount managers have undermined those programs’ authority by paying a $16 million settlement to President Trump for what many experts believe was a flimsy lawsuit tied to a “60 Minutes” interview with former U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris. Two senior executives, Bill Owens, the former “60 Minutes” executive producer, and Wendy McMahon, the former head of CBS News and local stations, both left the company, citing differences of opinion on how Paramount was handling these matters. More recently, CBS News agreed to only present live interviews on “Face the Nation,” giving up its ability to edit out falsehoods or stonewalling by guests. Paramount drew further attention by installing a former Trump adviser, Kenneth Weinstein, as an ombudsman tasked with monitoring CBS News’ reporting and adjudicating claims of bias — a decision that could undermine the authority of the standards department. CBS News will still have executives overseeing standards and practices. Susan Zirinsky, a former CBS News president, was asked earlier in 2025 to serve as an interim “executive editor,” helping to vet stories and journalistic practices. Al Ortiz, a former CBS News senior producer and standards executive, Milne has held many roles at CBS News since joining in 2019. She was initially managing editor of “CBS This Morning,” an iteration of the CBS morning franchise that sought to devote more attention to harder news. She took on added leadership responsibilities during coronavirus pandemic and the 2020 presidential election. In 2021, she was given the additional role of overseeing a new unit devoted to examining misinformation and so-called “ deepfakes ,” or false videos that can often be generated via artificial intelligence. Before joining CBS News, Milne was the senior editor of video at ProPublica and head of live TV at Bloomberg TV. She spent the majority of her career at the BBC, where she worked in senior positions as a producer on the flagship broadcasts and across all digital and 24-hour news platforms. Milne has deep ties to CBS News. Her father, Stephen Milne, worked as an editor in CBS News’ London Bureau for 30 years, including more than a decade working for Don Hewitt, the first executive producer of “60 Minutes.” “I learned young the sacrifices you and your families make to do this work. The late nights, missed birthdays and holidays, while he worked in Iran during the hostage crisis, the Afghan war (the Soviet one), Israel, Iraq and so many other places. He gave me a curiosity about the world and a belief in the importance of what you all do. When he was home, I learned a lot at the kitchen table,” Milne said, adding: “It has been a privilege to work alongside all of you and hopefully sometimes help make your work a little better.”",https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/cbs-news-standards-chief-exit-claudia-milne-1236554051,Entertainment,variety.com,Brian Steinberg,https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2942108_0565bc2-e1760561998380.jpg?w=320&h=241&crop=1,2025-10-16T13:04:13+00:00,09d8dc92618bb5f3bb7bd701ece93e5ef8eed50e

Under the deal, Hamada, whose producing credits include “The Conjuring” franchise, “It” and “The Batman,” will continue to focus on the horror genre, delivering multiple low-to-mid-budget films annually for the studio. News of the renewal comes as Paramount launches the trailer for 18Hz Productions’ upcoming horror film “ Primate .” The movie — directed by Johannes Roberts and starring Johnny Sequoyah, Jessica Alexander and Troy Kotsur — follows as a group of friends’ tropical vacation turns into a terrifying, primal tale of horror and survival when the family’s adopted chimp abruptly turns homicidal. “Primate” made its world premiere as the opening night screening at Fantastic Fest last month and the film — which also features Victoria Wyant, Gia Hunter, Benjamin Cheng, Charlie Mann and Tienne Simon — will be released in theaters on Jan. 9. VIDEO Roberts directs from a script he co-wrote with Ernest Riera. The film is produced by Hamada alongside John Hodges and Bradley Pilz; executive producers are Vicki Dee Rock, Nathan Samdahl (for 18Hz), Roberts, Pete Chiappetta, Anthony Tittanegro and Andrew Lary. 18hz Productions’ upcoming slate includes an untitled horror film from director André Øvredal, which stars Jacob Scipio, Lou Llobell and Melissa Leo and is written by Zachary Donohue and T.W. Burgess; “Familiar” from director Caye Casas (“The Coffee Table”), based on an original script by Julien Magnat; and “Suffer Little Children” from writer-director Rodrigue Huart, which is a reimagining of the cult classic 1976 Spanish horror movie “Who Can Kill a Child?.” Plot details are under wraps, but the original film — directed by Narciso Ibáñez Serrador and based on the novel “El Juego de Los Ninos” by Juan José Plans — follows a couple who travel to a remote island for vacation only to realize that all the adults there have been killed. Øvredal’s film is produced by Hamada and Gary Dauberman via Coin Operated, with 18Hz’s Nathan Samdahl executive producing; Nick Romano will executive produce “Familiar” and “Suffer Little Children” on behalf of the company; the latter film is produced by Hamada alongside rightsholder Pablo Cruz of Canana.

50b0425358ec,"Spotify Partners With Sony, Universal, Warner and More to Develop AI Music Products",,"In a significant step towards interfacing with AI and its impact on the music industry, Spotify has partnered with the big three record companies — Sony Music Group, Universal Music Group and Warner Music Group — as well as licensing giant Merlin and global digital music company Believe to develop “responsible” AI products to empower artists and songwriters. Spotify announced its latest initiative to make “significant investments in AI research and product development,” according to a release, marking one of the first times that major music companies have come together to develop tools that address artists’ and songwriters’ concerns about AI usage in the music space. Spotify notes that it hopes to expand its partnership to additional distributors and rights holders over time. Though Spotify doesn’t outline any specific products in the works, the company states that there are plans in place to build a generative AI research lab and product team to develop technologies that reflect its mission. They lay out four areas of focus: partnering with labels, distributors and publishing companies to develop products for artists and fans through upfront agreements; offering artists and rights-holders the ability to opt-in to using generative music tools; building products to create new revenue streams; and creating a stronger artist-fan connection with the AI tools. “Some voices in the tech industry believe copyright should be abolished. We don’t,” the release states. “Musicians’ rights matter. Copyright is essential. If the music industry doesn’t lead in this moment, AI-powered innovation will happen elsewhere, without rights, consent, or compensation. Together with rightsholders, artists, and songwriters, we are making significant investments in AI research and product development.” The news comes less than a month after Spotify announced AI safeguards on the platform, revealing that over 75 million “spammy” tracks were removed over the past 12 months. Spotify said that its new protections included a policy to police unauthorized vocal impersonation (“deepfakes”) and fraudulent music uploaded to artists’ official profiles, as well as an enhanced spam filter to prevent mass uploads, duplicates, SEO hacks and artificially short tracks designed to fraudulently boost streaming numbers and payments. As AI becomes an increasing focus in the music industry, record labels are starting to meet the challenges that come with it. Last week, Universal Music Group Chairman and CEO Lucian Grainge sent a memo to his staff outlining the efforts being made to develop commercial opportunities related to Gen AI to benefit songwriters and artists and generate new revenue. He explained that UMG has been working with AI developers to implement responsible AI and product agreements, outlined how artists can participate, and elaborated on what the company is doing to encourage responsible AI policies. Regarding Spotify’s newest initiative, Alex Norström, co-president and chief business officer, stated, “Technology should always serve artists, not the other way around. Our focus at Spotify is making sure innovation supports artists by protecting their rights, respecting their creative choices, and creating new ways for fans to discover and enjoy the music they love.” Grainge said, “For several years we’ve been driving initiatives with our partners to put artists at the center of the conversation about Gen AI and have struck Artist-Centric agreements that establish innovative new vehicles to unlock the opportunities presented by this revolutionary technology. I commend Daniel, Alex and Gustav on taking these critical steps forward to advance this approach. It is essential that we work with strategic partners such as Spotify to enable Gen AI products within a thriving commercial landscape in which artists, songwriters, fans, music companies and technology companies can all flourish.” Sony Music Group Chairman Rob Stringer added, “We are pleased to be collaborating with Spotify to develop responsible generative AI offerings that broaden opportunities for artists and songwriters, whilst enhancing the music experience for fans. This is an acknowledgement that direct licensing in advance of launching new products is the only appropriate way to build them and demonstrates how a properly functioning market benefits everyone in the ecosystem and fuels innovation. We appreciate and applaud Spotify’s leadership at this critical period.” “We’ve been consistently focused on making sure AI works for artists and songwriters, not against them,” said Robert Kyncl, CEO of Warner Music Group. “That means collaborating with partners who understand the necessity for new AI licensing deals that protect and compensate rightsholders and the creative community. We support Spotify’s thoughtful AI guardrails, and welcome the opportunity to pioneer the future together.” Merlin COO Charlie Lexton stated, “Merlin’s approach to the use of AI in music is straightforward. We actively look for partners who respect and value copyright, respect and value artists and want to enrich, not displace, the creative community. Spotify’s principles on AI announced today demonstrate that same commitment. We are excited to work together to ensure these principles translate into products that genuinely enhance the creative and commercial eco-system – for the benefit of our independent members, their artists and their fans.” “At Believe, we have always seen two sides to AI and GenAI,” explained Denis Ladegaillerie, founder and CEO of Believe. “On the one side is ‘responsible AI,’ focused on artist and copyright protection, guided by our four principles of consent, control, compensation, and transparency. On the other side is ‘value-creative AI,’ innovations that place artists and their careers at the center, empowering creativity, accelerating music discovery, and deepening fan engagement. After supporting Spotify’s recent initiatives to strengthen AI protections, we are now thrilled to partner with Spotify to co-develop ‘value-creative AI’ tools that will fuel artist development and unlock new creative and commercial opportunities.” Gustav Söderström, Spotify’s co-president and chief product and technology officer, added, “AI is the most consequential technology shift since the smartphone, and it’s already reshaping how music is created and experienced. At Spotify, we want to build this future hand in hand with the music industry, guided by clear principles and deep respect for creators, just as we did in the days of piracy. Our company brings deep research expertise to this opportunity and we’re actively growing our AI team and capabilities to drive the continued growth of the entire music ecosystem.”",https://variety.com/2025/music/news/spotify-partners-sony-universal-warner-develop-ai-products-1236554321,Entertainment,variety.com,Steven J.

362898afe019,Denver study shows removing parking requirements results in more affordable housing being built,"building, buildings, colorado, construction, denver, housing, local, parking, parking garages","Removing parking requirements for new buildings could help thousands of Coloradans who struggle to afford housing . There is a shortage of over 106,000 homes across Colorado , according to a recent study by the Colorado State Demography Office. Nearly 90% of the lowest-income households in the state spend over one-third of their pretax income on rent or mortgage payments. That means they pay more on housing, as a percentage of their income, than is considered affordable . The cost of providing parking – borne by developers and passed on to residents – helps push prices up. Parking minimums may be mandated by city ordinances or demanded by lenders . Some renters prefer apartments that come with dedicated parking. Structured parking can cost as much as US$50,000 per parking space , according to Denver’s Community Planning and Development office. Off-street surface parking, though cheaper to construct, requires dedicating valuable urban land to parking lots. We are a law professor and urban planning scholar who worked with data scientists at the Terner Center for Housing Innovation to model how parking requirements affect the development of multifamily residential housing in the city and county of Denver. The construction of a new home along Tennyson Street in Denver in 2018. Helen H. Richardson/The Denver Post via Getty Images Cutting parking boosts construction We found that cutting minimum-parking requirements would likely boost housing construction in Denver by about 12.5%, translating into roughly 460 more homes per year. This is a surprisingly high-impact result for a single, relatively simple policy change. We published our findings as a white paper with the Rocky Mountain Land Use Institute in July 2025. In August 2025, the Denver City Council eliminated parking minimums for new buildings . Denver followed the lead of other cities such as Boulder , Longmont , Austin and Minneapolis that have all recently abolished parking minimums. In 2024, the Colorado legislature also removed parking minimums near transit hubs statewide in order to increase housing supply. However, that effort has been challenged in court on the grounds that the state mandates infringe on local government prerogatives . This legal tug-of-war underscores the importance of Denver’s decision. The sun shines on the building that houses the Denver City Council. Dee Liu via Getty Images Parking can be expensive Before the policy change, market-rate apartments in Denver were required by law to provide as many as one parking space per unit . In a 200-unit building, parking could add millions of dollars to the developer’s costs. Parking requirements are often determined by a formula. Based in part on an outdated view that modern cities should be car-oriented, cities around the country, including Denver, passed zoning codes in the 1950s and 1960s that created legal requirements for the number of parking spaces that new housing projects must include. Land is expensive in high-demand cities like Denver. Dedicating part of a building’s footprint to parking imposes both a direct cost – because developers must pay to build the parking – and an indirect cost, because it leaves less space for housing. These development costs are passed along to renters and owners, decreasing affordability. Street parking near 18th Avenue and Marion Street in Denver, Colo. Hyoung Chang/The Denver Post via Getty Images Reducing parking requirements lets developers build only the parking spaces that residents want or need. Eliminating parking minimums We built a simulator that estimates the total number of apartments expected to be built in multifamily, market-rate rental developments in Denver in one year. It then allows for a comparison of possible outcomes based on changing policy assumptions. Our predictions factor in: Building size and allowable unit counts for parcels. The type of development and corresponding number of units that are likely to be financially feasible. The probability that parcels might actually be developed in the future based on a statistical analysis of historical Denver development data. Following guidelines developed by the Lincoln Institute of Land Policy , we modeled 75 scenarios. They included five potential parking policies tested across five economic environments and three sets of assumptions for developer-driven parking inclusion. Changes would bring hundreds of housing units Our prediction that eliminating parking mandates in Denver could result in approximately 460 additional multifamily units per year is based on three assumptions: Somewhat unfavorable economic conditions, including high interest rates and relatively low margins for developers. Elimination of all regulatory parking mandates. Voluntary construction of 0.5 spaces per unit near light rail and 1.0 spaces per unit away from light rail. We find that eliminating parking minimums creates more options for developers and renters . Developers will still build parking where needed or demanded by city residents. Eliminating mandatory parking requirements offers several additional benefits. The city will save labor costs associated with enforcing parking requirements, reducing housing costs. The policy change frees up land for more economically productive uses and for desired civic infrastructure such as sidewalks or green space. Developers freed from building parking are also more likely to invest in beautifying their building for residents and pedestrians . Removing parking minimums can increase the flexibility to use small undeveloped or underdeveloped parcels for “ missing middle ” forms of housing, such as duplexes or triplexes. These forms of housing provide “gentle density,” meaning they do not significantly alter neighborhoods but still make them more affordable for lower- and middle-income people and increase the city’s overall housing supply. It can also allow for the adaptive reuse of historic buildings that may have been built before the city required on-site parking. And finally, eliminating a requirement for surplus parking spaces allows more compact, efficient forms of development , which results in more walkable cities and more connected neighborhoods.",https://theconversation.com/denver-study-shows-removing-parking-requirements-results-in-more-affordable-housing-being-built-263889,Society,theconversation.com,Stefan Chavez-Norgaard,https://images.theconversation.com/files/692788/original/file-20250924-56-ickdwt.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&rect=0%2C451%2C5676%2C2838&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop,2025-10-16T12:42:49+00:00,a2a286e71f45cac1434fc59afa36cfc89b6f5d75
975125f5a4c2,Banning abortion is a hallmark of authoritarian regimes,"abortion, abortion rights, authoritarianism, catholicism, civil liberties, democratic backsliding, el salvador, franco, latin america, mussolini, nicaragua, reproductive justice, reproductive rights, travel bans, trump 2.0, us democracy","Pregnant women crossing borders to get an abortion . People who miscarry facing jail time or dying from infection . Doctors who won’t perform lifesaving procedures on a pregnant patient for fear of prosecution. For years, this was the kind of thing that happened in Poland , Nicaragua or El Salvador . Now, it’s headline news in the United States . As a scholar who studies the relationship between reproductive rights and political regimes , I see the U.S. mirroring a pattern that has happened in authoritarian regimes around the world. When a government erects barriers to comprehensive reproductive care, it doesn’t just cause more death and suffering for women and their families. Such policies are often a first step in the gradual decline of democracies . Yet, the U.S. is different in a meaningful way. Here, abortion has historically been framed as a personal right to privacy. In many other countries I’ve studied, abortion is viewed more as a collective right that is inextricably tied to broader social and economic issues. The American individualist perspective on abortion can make it harder for people in the U.S. to understand why banning abortion can serve as a back door for the erosion of civil liberties – and of democracy itself . Autocrats target abortion first Restricting reproductive rights is a hallmark of authoritarian regimes. From Benito Mussolini’s Italy in 1926 and Josef Stalin’s Soviet Union in 1936 to Francisco Franco’s Spain in 1941 and Nicolae Ceaușescu’s Romania in 1966, the first move most 20th-century dictators made after seizing power was to criminalize abortion and contraception. Polish demonstrators demand ‘stop killing us’ at a march to overturn Poland’s extremely restrictive abortion law in Warsaw, Poland, on June 14, 2023. Czarek Sokolowski/AP Initially, for some of those autocratic leaders, limiting access to abortion and contraception was a strategy to gain the approval of the nation’s religious leaders. The Catholic Church held great power in Italy and Spain, as did the Orthodox Church in Romania. At the time, these faiths opposed artificial birth control and still believe life begins at conception. Restrictions on reproductive rights also aimed to increase birth rates following two world wars that had stamped out some of the population, particularly in the Soviet Union and Italy. Many political leaders saw procreation as a national duty . They designated women – white, heterosexual women, that is – specific roles, primarily as mothers, to produce babies as well as future soldiers and workers for their regimes. In the past two decades, countries in Europe and the Americas have been following this recognizable pattern. Nicaragua and Poland have both banned abortion. Hungary , Turkey and Russia have all clamped down on access to it. Restricting reproductive freedoms has helped Hungary’s Viktor Orbán, Russia’s Vladimir Putin and Turkey’s Recep Tayyip Erdoğan stoke lasting political divisions within society that help them consolidate their own power. These leaders invoke a threat of moral and demographic decline , claiming that child-free women, queer people and immigrants pose a danger to national survival. In doing so, they portray themselves as defenders of their respective nations. It’s a way to regain and retain popular support even as their policies deepen poverty , erode civil liberties and increase corruption . These politicians have also taken power away from a significant portion of the population by reinstating earlier, fascist-era restrictions on bodily autonomy. As feminist scholars have pointed out, strong reproductive rights are central to functioning democracies. Restrictions on reproductive freedoms often necessitate other kinds of restrictions to enforce and maintain them. These might include free speech limits that prohibit providers from discussing people’s reproductive options. Criminalizing political dissent enables the arrest of people who protest restrictions on reproductive freedoms. Travel bans threaten prison time for individuals who help young people get abortion care out of state. When these civil liberties weaken, it becomes harder to defend other rights. Without the right to speak, dissent or move freely, people cannot engage in conversations, organize or voice collective grievances. Putting the US in a global context In 2022, the U.S. joined the likes of Poland and Hungary when the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, ending 50 years of federal abortion protections. President Donald Trump was not in power when this happened. Yet the Supreme Court’s conservative majority was shaped during his first term . Since then, both the second Trump administration and many states have enacted their own regulations or bans on abortion. This has created a divided country where in some states abortion is as restricted as it is under some of the world’s most autocratic regimes. Yet, there’s a key difference. In the U.S., abortion is viewed by the law and the public as a matter of individual rights. The debate often boils down to whether a person should be allowed to terminate their pregnancy. In many other contexts, reproductive rights are understood as a collective good that benefits all society – or, conversely, harms all society when revoked. This perspective can be a powerful driver of change. It’s how, for example, women’s and feminist groups in places such as Argentina , Colombia and Mexico have successfully pressured their governments to decriminalize abortion in recent years. Since 2018, the movement known as Latin America’s Green Wave, or “Marea Verde ” for their green protest bandannas, has deliberately and strategically reframed abortion as a human right and used that assertion to expand reproductive rights. The Latin American feminist activists have also documented how restricting abortion intensifies authoritarianism and worsens both individual and collective rights. Argentine feminists fought for decades to get legal abortion. In 2020, Congress finally voted to decriminalize the procedure. Victor R. Caivano/AP In a region where many citizens remember life under military dictatorship, highlighting the relationship between abortion and authoritarianism may be particularly galvanizing. Limits of framing abortion as an individual right Roe v. Wade in 1973 recognized abortion as a private medical decision between “ the woman and her responsible physician ” up to the point of fetal viability − roughly around 24 to 26 weeks − and that framing has stuck. This was basically what the mainstream pro-choice movement advocated for at the time. White feminists saw abortion rights as a personal liberty . This framing has real limitations. As Black and brown reproductive justice advocates have long pointed out, Roe never served women of color or poor people particularly well because of underlying unequal access to health care. Their work has, for decades, illustrated the strong connection between racial, economic and reproductive justice, yet abortion is still largely regarded as solely an individual issue. When debates about reproductive freedoms are framed as fights over individual rights, it can engender a legal quagmire. Other entities with rights emerge – the fetus, for example, or a potential grandparent – and are pitted against the pregnant person . Recently, for instance, a pregnant woman declared brain dead in Georgia was kept alive for several months until her fetus became viable, apparently to comply with the state’s strict anti-abortion law. As her mother told the press , her family had no say in the matter. Narrowly focusing on abortion as an individual right can also obscure why banning it has societal impacts. Research worldwide shows that restricting reproductive freedoms does not lead to fewer abortions. Abortion bans only make abortion dangerous as people turn to unregulated “back alley” procedures. Maternal and infant mortality rates rise , especially in marginalized communities. Simply stated: More women and babies die when abortion and contraception laws become more restrictive . Other kinds of suffering increase, too. Women and their families tend to become poorer when contraception and abortion are hard to get. Abortion bans also lead to discriminatory practices in health care beyond reproductive health services, such as oncology, neurology and cardiology . Physicians who fear criminalization are forced to withhold or alter gold-standard treatments for pregnant patients, for example, or they may prescribe less effective drugs out of concern about legal consequences should patients later become pregnant. Lifesaving procedures in the emergency room must await a negative pregnancy test. As a result, abortion bans decrease the quality and effectiveness of medical care for many patients, not just those who are pregnant. Defending reproductive freedoms for healthy democracies These findings demonstrate why reproductive rights are really a collective good. When viewed this way, it illuminates why they are an essential element of democracy. Already, the rollback of reproductive freedoms in the U.S. has been followed by efforts to limit other key areas of freedoms, including LGBTQ rights , freedom of speech and the right to travel . Access to safe abortion for pregnant people, gender-affirming care for trans youth, and international travel for noncitizens are intertwined rights – not isolated issues. When the government starts stripping away any of these rights, I believe it signals serious trouble for democracy.

55637e71219e,"Why countries struggle to quit fossil fuels, despite higher costs and 30 years of climate talks and treaties","brazil, china, climate change, cop30, energy, europe, european union (eu), renewable energy, un climate summit, us energy policy, world","Fossil fuels still power much of the world , even though renewable energy has become cheaper in most places and avoids both pollution and the climate damage caused by burning coal, oil and natural gas. To understand this paradox, it helps to look at how countries – particularly major greenhouse gas emitters, including the U.S., China and European nations – are balancing the pressures of rising electricity demand with the global need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions that are warming the planet . US embraces fossil fuels The United States makes no secret of its fossil fuel ambitions. It has a wealth of fossil fuel reserves and a politically powerful oil and gas industry. Since President Donald Trump took office in January 2025, his administration has been promoting oil and gas drilling and coal production, pointing to rising electricity demand to justify its moves , particularly to power artificial intelligence data centers . Reviving the “drill, baby, drill” mantra, the Trump administration has now embraced a “ mine, baby, mine ” agenda to try to revive U.S. coal production, which fell dramatically over the past two decades as cheaper natural gas and renewable energy rose. U.S. President Donald Trump shakes hands with coal industry employees who were invited to watch him sign legislation in April 2025 promoting fossil fuels. Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post via Getty Images The Department of Interior on Sept. 29 rolled out a plan to “unleash American coal power ” by opening 13 million acres of federal land to mining. The Department of Energy also pledged US$625 million to try to make coal competitive. It includes lowering the royalty rates mining companies pay and extending the operating lifespans of coal-fired power plants. However, these initiatives further lock communities with coal plants into a carbon-intensive fossil fuel. Coal’s resurgence would also have public health costs . Its pollution is linked to respiratory illness, heart disease and thousands of premature deaths each year from 1999 to 2020 in the United States. The Trump administration is also ceding the clean energy technology race to China. The administration is ending many renewable energy tax credits and pulling federal support for energy research projects. I work in the Climate Policy Lab at The Fletcher School of Tufts University , where we maintain a suite of databases for analyzing countries’ energy research budgets. The Trump administration’s 2026 U.S. budget request would slash funding for energy research, development and demonstration to $2.9 billion — just over half the budget allocated in 2025. These energy research investments would fall to levels not seen since the mid-1980s or early 2000s, even when accounting for inflation. China’s clean energy push – and coal expansion While the United States is cutting renewable energy funding, China is doubling down on clean energy technologies . Its large government subsidies and manufacturing capacity have helped China dominate global solar panel production and supply chains for wind turbines, batteries and electric vehicles . Cheaper Chinese-manufactured clean energy technologies have enabled many emerging economies, such as Brazil and South Africa , to reduce fossil fuel use in their power grids. Brazil surged into the global top five for solar generation in 2024, producing 75 terawatt-hours (TWh) of electricity and surpassing Germany’s 71 TWh. The International Energy Agency now expects global renewable energy capacity to double by 2030 , even with a sharp drop expected in U.S. renewable energy growth. However, while China expands clean energy access around the world, its production and emissions from coal continue to rise: In the first half of 2025, China commissioned 21 gigawatts (GW) of new coal power plants , with projections of over 80 GW for the full year. This would be the largest surge in new coal power capacity in a decade for China. Although China pledged to phase down its coal use between 2026 to 2030, rising energy demand may make the plan difficult to realize. China’s paradox — leading in clean energy innovations while expanding coal — reflects the tension between ensuring energy security and reducing emissions and climate impact. Europe’s scramble for reliable energy sources The European Union is pursuing strategies to reduce its reliance on fossil fuels amid the ongoing geopolitical tensions with Russia. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine exposed many countries to supply disruptions and geopolitical turmoil, and it triggered a global energy crisis as countries once reliant on Russian oil and gas scrambled to find alternatives. In June 2025, the European Commission proposed a regulation to phase out Russian fossil fuel imports by the end of 2027, aiming to enhance energy security and stabilize prices. This initiative is part of the broader REPowerEU plan. The plan focuses on increasing clean energy production, improving energy efficiency and diversifying oil and gas supplies away from Russia. Renewables are now the leading source of electric power in the EU, though natural gas and oil still account for more than half of Europe’s total energy supply. The EU’s fossil energy phaseout plan also faces challenges. Slovakia and Hungary have expressed resistance to the proposed phaseout, citing concerns over energy affordability and the need for alternative supply sources. Hungarian Prime Minister Victor Orbán said Hungary would continue importing Russian oil and gas . Cutting off these supplies, he asserted, would be an economic “disaster” and immediately reduce Hungary’s economic output by 4%. The path to reducing Europe’s dependence on fossil fuels thus involves navigating internal disagreements and incentivizing long-run sustainable development. Europe does appear to be gaining in one way from the U.S. pullback from clean energy. Global investment in renewable energy, which hit a record high in the first half of 2025 , increased in the EU as it fell in the U.S., according to BloombergNEF’s analysis. Brazil: Torn on fossil fuels as it hosts climate talks In November 2025, representatives from countries around the world will gather in Brazil for the annual United Nations climate conference, COP30. The meeting marks three decades of international climate negotiations and a decade since nations signed the Paris Agreement to limit global temperature rise. The conference’s setting in Belém, a city in the Amazon rainforest, reflects both the stakes and contradictions of climate commitments: a vital ecosystem at risk of collapse as the planet warms, in a nation that pledges climate leadership while expanding oil and gas production and exploring for oil in the Foz do Amazonas region, the mouth of the Amazon River. Thirty years into global climate talks, the disconnect between promises and practices has never been so clear. The world is not on track to meet the Paris temperature goals, and the persistence of fossil fuels is a major reason why. Negotiators are expected to debate measures to curb methane emissions and support the transition from fossil fuels . But whether the discussions can eventually translate into a concrete global phaseout plan remains to be seen. Without credible plans to actually reduce fossil fuel dependence, the annual climate talks risk becoming another point of geopolitical tension.",https://theconversation.com/why-countries-struggle-to-quit-fossil-fuels-despite-higher-costs-and-30-years-of-climate-talks-and-treaties-266993,Society,theconversation.com,Kate Hua-Ke Chi,https://images.theconversation.com/files/695477/original/file-20251009-66-1gfhdk.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&rect=531%2C2058%2C4635%2C2317&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop,2025-10-16T12:42:21+00:00,edf20a6adcf5cfb8382cd425b24970e0a9d4fa1e
87408a1c54bc,Why and how does personality emerge? Studying the evolution of individuality using thousands of fruit flies,"artificial selection, evolution, evolutionary biology, fruit flies, genetic variation, natural selection, personality, scientists at work, selection","As a Ph.D. student, I wanted to understand the evolution of individual differences in fruit fly behavior – the building blocks of personality. My experiments involved measuring how my tiny subjects acted in a maze. So each day in the lab began with using a thin paintbrush to lift a single, anesthetized fruit fly and transfer it into a simple maze. After it woke up and had explored the maze, I’d place the fly – careful not to let it escape in transit – back into a tube where it could eat and hang out while I decided its fate. My labmates and I repeated that process again and again, ultimately measuring the behavior of 900 individual flies daily. As many as 1,500 flies live in each of these Drosophila population cages. The bottles inside contain the food medium they eat and lay eggs on. Researchers can reach in the side to extract fruit flies. Shraddha Lall I listened to countless podcasts and audiobooks over many days of moving lots of flies around by hand and keeping track of their individual identities, but this wasn’t how I’d originally planned this experiment. I had been excited to work with MAPLE, my lab’s robot , to automate the first and last steps of the process. MAPLE would grab individual flies, safely move them into their own tiny mazes, and back out after I’d measured their behaviors. I’d been trying for months to modify MAPLE’s code. I finally got it running smoothly – and then on Day 1 of my 500-day experiment, MAPLE did not work. MAPLE hard at work moving flies into Y-mazes. After a little bit of panic, and a lot of deep breathing, I decided to power through without the robot’s help. MAPLE’s refusal to cooperate was the first of many obstacles I faced as I continued my experiment for the next year and a half. During this time, I learned a lot about the building blocks of personality – as well as the challenges of doing scientific research and how to work around them. Animals have personalities As an evolutionary biologist who studies animal behavior, I’m fascinated that no two individuals are completely alike. Think about the animal friends in your life — cats and dogs have unique personalities and idiosyncrasies, whether it’s a specific food they hate or a particular way they like to nap. All animals – from the smallest worm to the biggest whale – have personalities : individual behavioral preferences that remain more or less stable throughout their lifetime. In Drosophila melanogaster , the fruit flies I worked with, individuality is evident in simple binary behaviors . Individual flies show a preference for turning left or right, choosing a hot or cool environment, preferring brightly lit areas or the shade, and many other idiosyncrasies. Both nature and nurture influence animal personality. The environment during development can play a crucial role in some instances. In others, genes inherited from parents can drive preferences. In certain populations of fruit flies, for example, parents that like hot temperatures increase the chances that offspring prefer hot temperatures. All animals, including fruit flies, have individual preferences that are the building blocks of their personalities. vasekk/iStock via Getty Images Plus It is also possible for genes to influence how much individuals differ from each other. For instance, certain combinations of genes can lead individual fruit flies to have widely different temperature preferences , with some liking colder temperatures and others preferring it warm. These genes determine how wide the range of temperatures an individual’s preferences are drawn from. Scientists have found genes that influence variation in traits in many animals and plants , so evolution seems to have kept them around for a reason. But what’s the benefit of a gene that makes individuals within a group different from each other? The benefits of variation An evolutionary theory called bet-hedging suggests that in an unpredictable environment, having options can be less risky. When conditions are fluctuating, there is no one behavior that is best suited for the environment. Variability-influencing genes can be adaptive in this situation. Take temperature preference, for example. Imagine that an organism can have either a low temperature-variability gene, which I will call low-var, or a high temperature-variability gene, high-var. Animals with the low-var gene have similar temperature preferences and can all survive and reproduce when the environment has stable, average temperatures. Comparatively, animals with high-var have very different temperature preferences from each other. When the environment has average, stable temperatures, the preference of some animals with the high-var gene may be a good fit for conditions. They’ll be able to reproduce, but many other high-var individuals may not. However, if temperatures fluctuate unpredictably, going below or above the average, all the low-var animals will be unfit and unable to pass on their genes. The low-var population would completely collapse. In the high-var group, no matter how the environment fluctuates, there would be some individuals whose particular temperature preference makes them able to survive, reproduce and pass on the high-var gene. Bet-hedging theory explains how a gene increasing variability can be beneficial when the environment fluctuates. In the first generation, the low- and high-variability flies are well-suited to a warm environment. In the second generation, the environment is cool and the low-variability offspring aren’t fit for the conditions, while at least one fly from the high-variability line is. Shraddha Lall The competition underlying evolution is a fight for which genes win out and are able to persist over time. In fluctuating environments, a gene that makes the individuals variable across a certain trait, such as temperature preference, has a better chance of persisting long term . Populations with these kinds of bet-hedging genes can therefore have a higher chance of surviving in unpredictable environments. How can evolution shape this variation, and what kinds of genes are involved? To answer this question, I turned to artificial selection . This process is akin to how humans have domesticated plants and animals for millennia. An experimenter screens individuals from a population for a trait of interest, and only those that meet a certain threshold are allowed to reproduce to create the next generation. Instead of nature deciding who survives, the researcher chooses. Variability in behavior responds to evolution To evolve high variability, I picked a simple behavior: turn bias . When given a choice to turn left or right in a Y-shaped maze, some flies almost always choose left, others almost always choose right, and others choose left sometimes and right sometimes. These preferences remain stable over their lifetime, and their genetic background plays a role in determining it. Which way will the fruit fly go, left or right? Shraddha Lall While the particular turn bias is not inherited – a left-turning mom and a left-turning dad don’t necessarily make left-turning fly babies – the variability in turn bias can be influenced by genes. This potential for variability can be considered the fly’s “personality” – whether that’s a strong preference for one direction or a more flexible approach. For 21 generations, I used video and a type of AI called computer vision to track thousands of flies . I focused on siblings that shared a mother. If a sibling group made very similar turn choices, they likely had low-variability genes. If a group of siblings was mixed in terms of how biased they were for turning left or right, it was likely their lineage had a high-variability gene. The next step was the artificial selection. I’d choose the families most likely to have the high-variability genes to mate and produce the next generation. Computer vision can track individual flies in mazes and record their movements. At the end of my experiment, I had evolved populations with very high levels of turn-bias variability. My results showed that variability in traits and increased individuality in behaviors can evolve in response to selection, definitely in the lab and potentially also in nature. Now, I’m working on figuring out what happened to their genes as the flies evolved, and how their bodies and brains might have changed when I forced them onto this evolutionary path. Creating a world where bet-hedging dominates I now knew that increased behavioral individuality can evolve. That is, flies can evolve differing personalities driven by selection. Could I recreate in the lab the environmental conditions that would lead to this evolution in nature? Fruit flies are ectotherms , meaning they need to get heat from external sources. Their temperature preference ensures that they find a suitable environment to live and lay eggs in. In a world with increasing unpredictability in temperatures , bet-hedging strategies may evolve as animals adapt. Based on bet-hedging theory, I hypothesized that evolving in an unpredictable thermal environment in the lab, with temperatures fluctuating over generations, would lead to the evolution of higher variability in temperature preferences. With this in mind, a labmate and I began creating houses for flies where we could control temperatures of different areas and change them over time. Unfortunately, time and logistics stopped this experiment, and it sits in storage now. I hope to continue this work someday. My fly experiments taught me a lot about how animal behavior evolves, and also a lot about the process of doing research. There have been two constants – first, sometimes things don’t work out, and that’s OK. And second, regardless of the challenges – including broken robots, long hours and paused experiments – I want to keep exploring how evolution can shape personality as animals adapt to changing environments.",https://theconversation.com/why-and-how-does-personality-emerge-studying-the-evolution-of-individuality-using-thousands-of-fruit-flies-261615,Society,theconversation.com,Shraddha Lall,https://images.theconversation.com/files/696697/original/file-20251016-56-pgl0cg.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&rect=72%2C0%2C5129%2C2564&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop,2025-10-16T12:42:10+00:00,57b434bf27121e4d4b34b60dfa30bfad0f1b2e71

This medical device has been around for over 200 years and remains a staple in the clinic despite significant advances in medical diagnostics and technologies. The stethoscope is a medical instrument used to listen to and amplify the internal sounds produced by the body. Physicians still use the sounds they hear through stethoscopes as initial indicators of heart or lung diseases. For example, a heart murmur or crackling lungs often signify an issue is present. Although there have been significant advances in imaging and monitoring technologies, the stethoscope remains a quick, accessible and cost-effective tool for assessing a patient’s health. Though stethoscopes remain useful today, audible symptoms of disease often appear only at later stages of illness . At that point, treatments are less likely to work and outcomes are often poor. This is especially the case for heart disease, where changes in heart sounds are not always clearly defined and may be difficult to hear. We are scientists and engineers who are exploring ways to use heart sounds to detect disease earlier and more accurately. Our research suggests that combining stethoscopes with artificial intelligence could help doctors be less reliant on the human ear to diagnose heart disease, leading to more timely and effective treatment. History of the stethoscope The invention of the stethoscope is widely credited to the 19th-century French physician René Theophile Hyacinthe Laënnec. Before the stethoscope, physicians often placed their ear directly on a patient’s chest to listen for abnormalities in breathing and heart sounds. In 1816, a young girl showing symptoms of heart disease sought consultation with Laënnec. Placing his ear on her chest, however, was considered socially inappropriate. Inspired by children transmitting sounds through a long wooden stick, he instead rolled a sheet of paper to listen to her heart. He was surprised by the sudden clarity of the heart sounds, and the first stethoscope was born. One of René Laënnec’s original wooden stethoscopes. Science Museum London/Science and Society Picture Library , CC BY-NC-SA Over the next couple of decades, researchers modified the shape of this early stethoscope to improve its comfort, portability and sound transmission. This includes the addition of a thin, flat membrane called a diaphragm that vibrates and amplifies sound. The next major breakthrough occurred in the mid-1850s, when Irish physician Arthur Leared and American physician George Philip Cammann developed stethoscopes that could transmit sounds to both ears. These binaural stethoscopes use two flexible tubes connected to separate earpieces, allowing clearer and more balanced sound by reducing outside noise. These early models are remarkably similar to the stethoscopes medical doctors use today, with only slight modifications mainly designed for user comfort. Listening to the heart Medical schools continue to teach the art of auscultation – the use of sound to assess the function of the heart, lungs and other organs. Digital models of stethoscopes, which have been commercially available since the early 2000s, offer new tools like sound amplification and recording – yet the basic principle that Laënnec introduced endures. When listening to the heart, doctors pay close attention to the familiar “lub-dub” rhythm of each heartbeat . The first sound – the lub – happens when the valves between the upper and lower chambers of the heart close as it contracts and pushes blood out to the body. The second sound – the dub – occurs when the valves leading out of the heart close as the heart relaxes and refills with blood. The diaphragm and bell of a stethoscope transmit different sound frequencies to the listener. Jarould/Wikimedia Commons , CC BY-SA Along with these two normal sounds, doctors also listen for unusual noises – such as murmurs, extra beats or clicks – that can point to problems with how blood is flowing or whether the heart valves are working properly. Heart sounds can vary greatly depending on the type of heart disease present . Sometimes, different diseases produce the same abnormal sound. For example, a systolic murmur – an extra sound between first and second heart sounds – may be heard with narrowing of either the aortic or pulmonary valve. Yet the very same murmur can also appear when the heart is structurally normal and healthy. This overlap makes it challenging to diagnose disease based solely on the presence of murmurs. Teaching AI to hear what people can’t AI technology can identify the hidden differences in the sounds of healthy and damaged hearts and use them to diagnose disease before traditional acoustic changes like murmurs even appear. Instead of relying on the presence of extra or abnormal sounds to diagnose disease, AI can detect differences in sound that are too faint or subtle for the human ear to detect. To build these algorithms, researchers record heart sounds using digital stethoscopes . These stethoscopes convert sound into electronic signals that can be amplified, stored and analyzed using computers. Researchers can then label which sounds are normal or abnormal to train an algorithm to recognize patterns in the sounds it can then use to predict whether new sounds are normal or abnormal. Stethoscopes can capture diagnostic information the human ear alone cannot hear. Drs Producoes/E+ via Getty Images Researchers are developing algorithms that can analyze digitally recorded heart sounds in combination with digital stethoscopes as a low-cost, noninvasive and accessible tool to screen for heart disease. However, a lot of these algorithms are built on datasets of moderate-to-severe heart disease. Because it is difficult to find patients at early stages of disease, prior to when symptoms begin to show, the algorithms don’t have much information on what hearts in the earliest stages of disease sound like. To bridge this gap, our team is using animal models to teach the algorithms to analyze heart sounds to find early signs of disease. After training the algorithms on these sounds, we assess its accuracy by comparing it with image scans of calcium buildup in the heart. Our research suggests that an AI-based algorithm can classify healthy heart sounds correctly over 95% of the time and can even differentiate between types of heart disease with nearly 85% accuracy. Most importantly, our algorithm is able to detect early stages of disease, before cardiac murmurs or structural changes appear. We believe teaching AI to hear what humans can’t could transform how doctors diagnose and respond to heart disease.",https://theconversation.com/stethoscope-meet-ai-helping-doctors-hear-hidden-sounds-to-better-diagnose-disease-267373,Society,theconversation.com,Joshua Hutcheson,https://images.theconversation.com/files/696341/original/file-20251015-56-kodghd.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&rect=0%2C274%2C2500%2C1250&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop,2025-10-16T12:41:53+00:00,c960a08578612d8b44f88adcd877ef6d339848cc
4d5bd8541cb8,The real reason conservatives are furious about Bad Bunny’s forthcoming Super Bowl performance,"bad bunny, donald trump, english, football, immigration, immigration and customs enforcement (ice), language, latin america, music, nfl, puerto rico, rapper, spanish, super bowl, trump administration","Soon after the NFL’s announcement that Puerto Rican rapper Bad Bunny would headline the Super Bowl halftime show, conservative media outlets and Trump administration officials went on the attack . Homeland Security head Kristi Noem promised that U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement “ would be all over the Super Bowl .” President Donald Trump called the selection “ absolutely ridiculous .” Right-wing commentator Benny Johnson bemoaned the fact that the rapper has “ no songs in English .” Bad Bunny, conservative pundit Tomi Lahren complained, is “ Not an American artist .” Bad Bunny – born Benito A. Martínez Ocasio – is a superstar, one of the top-streaming artists in the world . And because he is Puerto Rican, he’s a U.S. citizen, too . To be sure, Bad Bunny checks many boxes that irk conservatives. He endorsed Kamala Harris for president in 2024 . There’s his gender-bending wardrobe . He has slammed the Trump administration’s anti-immigration policies . He has declined to tour on the U.S. mainland , fearing that some of his fans could be targeted and deported by ICE. And his explicit lyrics – most of which are in Spanish – would make even the most ardent free speech warrior cringe. And yet, as experts on issues of national identity and U.S. immigration policies , we think Lahren’s and Johnson’s insults get at the heart of why the rapper has created such a firestorm on the right. The spectacle of a Spanish-speaking rapper performing during the most-watched sporting event on American TV is a direct rebuke of the Trump administration’s efforts to paper over the country’s diversity. The Puerto Rican colony Bad Bunny was born in 1994 in Puerto Rico, an unincorporated U.S. territory that the country acquired after the 1898 Spanish-American War . It is home to 3.2 million U.S. citizens by birth. If it were a state, it would be the 30th largest by population, according to the 2020 U.S. Census. But Puerto Rico is not a state; it is a colony from a bygone era of U.S. overseas imperial expansion. Puerto Ricans do not have voting representatives in Congress, and they do not get to help elect the president of the United States. They are also divided over the island’s future . Large pluralities seek either U.S. statehood or an enhanced form of the current commonwealth status, while a smaller minority vie for independence. Revelers in New York’s Spanish Harlem wave Puerto Rican flags during the neighborhood’s annual 116th street festival. Mario Tama/Getty Images But one thing is clear to all Puerto Ricans: They’re from a nonsovereign land, with a clearly defined Latin American culture – one of the oldest in the Americas. Puerto Rico may belong to the U.S. – and many Puerto Ricans embrace that special relationship – but the island itself does not sound or feel like the U.S. The over 5.8 million Puerto Ricans that reside in the 50 states further complicate that picture. While legally they are U.S. citizens, mainstream Americans often don’t see Puerto Ricans that way. In fact, a 2017 poll found that only 54% of Americans knew that Puerto Ricans were U.S. citizens. The alien-citizen paradox Puerto Ricans exist in what we describe as the “ alien-citizen paradox ”: They are U.S. citizens, but only those residing in the mainland enjoy all the rights of citizenship. A recent congressional report stated that U.S. citizenship for Puerto Ricans “is not equal, permanent, irrevocable citizenship protected by the 14th Amendment … and Congress retains the right to determine the disposition of the territory .” Any U.S. citizen that moves to Puerto Rico no longer possesses the full rights of U.S. citizens of the mainland. Bad Bunny’s selection for the Super Bowl halftime show illustrates this paradox. In addition to criticisms from public figures, there were widespread calls among MAGA influencers to deport the rapper This is but one way Puerto Ricans, as well as other Latino citizens, are reminded of their status as “others.” ICE apprehensions of people merely appearing to be an immigrant – a tactic that was recently given the blessing of the Supreme Court – is an example of their alienlike status. And the bulk of the ICE raids have occurred in predominantly Latino communities in Los Angeles , Chicago and New York . This has forced many Latino communities to cancel Hispanic Heritage Month celebrations . Bad Bunny’s global reach The xenophobic fervor against Bad Bunny has led political leaders like House Speaker Mike Johnson to call for a more suitable figure for the Super Bowl, such as country music artist Lee Greenwood. Referring to Bad Bunny, Johnson said “it sounds like he’s not someone who appeals to a broader audience.” But the facts counter that claim. The Puerto Rican artist sits atop the global music charts . He has over 80 million monthly Spotify listeners . And he has sold nearly five times more albums than Greenwood . That global appeal has impressed the NFL, which hopes to host as many as eight international games next season . Additionally, Latinos represent the league’s fastest-growing fan base, and Mexico is its largest international market, with a reported 39.5 million fans . The Bad Bunny Super Bowl saga may actually become an important political moment. Conservatives, in their efforts to highlight Bad Bunny’s “otherness” – despite the United States being the second-largest Spanish-speaking country in the world – may have unwittingly educated America on the U.S. citizenship of Puerto Ricans. In the meantime, Puerto Ricans and the rest of the U.S. Latino community continue to wonder when they’ll be accepted as social equals.",https://theconversation.com/the-real-reason-conservatives-are-furious-about-bad-bunnys-forthcoming-super-bowl-performance-267078,Society,theconversation.com,Ediberto Román,https://images.theconversation.com/files/695775/original/file-20251012-56-i1expi.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&rect=545%2C725%2C2167%2C1083&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop,2025-10-16T12:41:43+00:00,84786a7b3c83a3059a37378c9c7a9c179b4ba72f

This is despite growing availability of a highly effective HIV prevention medication that has made it possible to live a long, healthy life with this once fatal disease. This medication – called preexposure prophylaxis, or PrEP – reduces the risk of HIV transmission by over 99% when taken as prescribed. Yet, in Southern cities such as Jackson, Mississippi, and Memphis, Tennessee, one of the most vulnerable populations – Black men who have sex with men – are rarely using it, with fewer than 1 in 5 who are eligible taking the drug. The Trump administration has previously frozen and proposed more cuts to HIV prevention programs in the U.S. And although the administration has restored some of the federal webpages and datasets it took down in January 2025, it is unclear what information remains missing or has changed. Communities in the South that already face the highest burden of infection will feel the greatest effects of changing public health priorities. In my work as a public health researcher , I have spent years studying HIV prevention and the social determinants of health in the Deep South. Through interviews with health care providers and Black patients in major Southern cities, what I learned was that a powerful clash between culture and public health plays a significant role in why effective medical treatments are still failing to reach those who need it most. I call this tension the Southern paradox – where medical solutions exist but systemic forces block access. The stories of these clinicians and patients in the South weren’t simply about a pill: They were about trust, identity, family and faith. And their words highlighted a complex web of emotions and experiences that often go unaddressed in standard health messaging. Southern culture and sexual health In my recent study , I interviewed 12 people in Jackson, Memphis, New Orleans and Atlanta: eight Black men who have sex with men , along with four health care providers. Three of these providers also identified as men who have sex with men. Many participants reported that physical access to PrEP wasn’t the issue. Instead, what stood in the way was far more personal and deeply embedded in their environment. “In church, you’re taught to love your neighbor, but there’s always an asterisk when it comes to who you love,” one participant from Jackson told me. “If you’re gay, you’re either ignored or silently judged.” Nearly all participants described the South as a place deeply shaped by conservative values , especially those rooted in religion and traditional family structures. The Black church emerged as both a protective factor and a challenge. While offering vital community support, it also often reinforced stigma around homosexuality and discouraged open conversations about sexual health. Tackling HIV in the South takes a village. One participant from New Orleans shared that he heard about PrEP from his health care provider and his friends, while another from Atlanta recalled learning about PrEP during his annual physical. Despite repeatedly being exposed to information about PrEP, both described hesitation about starting treatment. One worried about potential stigma if others discovered he was taking it, while the other questioned whether he “really needed” it. Ultimately, neither had started PrEP. In many of these communities, sex education in schools is still focused on abstinence and often excludes LGBTQ+ topics entirely. “You grow up not hearing anything about gay sex or HIV,” one man from Memphis said. “So, when you get older, it’s like starting from scratch.” Even decisions around condom use were heavily shaped by cultural norms. Men described relying on partner trust, age or perceived cleanliness rather than research-based ways to reduce the risk of HIV . This absence of comprehensive, inclusive sex education leaves many vulnerable to misinformation and, ultimately, to preventable infections. Trust is the real barrier One of the most striking findings from these conversations was the deep mistrust that many Black men who have sex with men feel toward the health care system. “It’s hard to find affirming care for people in the queer community,” said one Memphis-based health provider. Others talked about fears of being “outed” through their insurance, especially if they were still on a family health plan. A Jackson-based participant confided, “Some people avoid taking [PrEP] because for each prescription you are required to be evaluated. Some people don’t want the follow-up or the screening.” Another noted how fear of both outright and subtle judgment during medical appointments made it easier to avoid health care altogether. A welcoming health care environment can make all the difference. Jahi Chikwendiu/The Washington Post via Getty Images Systemic racism compounds these concerns. For many Black men, historical and ongoing experiences of discrimination , including rushed visits, lack of empathy, misdiagnoses and even being denied care altogether have built a lasting sense of caution. Even when resources like PrEP are available, these treatments often feel inaccessible to Black men because they do not trust the system offering them. Social networks step in Thankfully, these conversations also uncovered moments of hope. Many participants learned about PrEP from peers. “We talk about it regularly,” said one participant in Jackson. “I have friends who work in public health, along with friends who are taking the medication.” In the South, where community ties often serve as critical safety nets, these social networks can sometimes provide more trusted health information than clinics or campaigns. Informal conversations in group chats, at house parties or during community gatherings often serve as powerful platforms for health promotion. One provider in Atlanta said he intentionally shared his own experiences with PrEP to reduce stigma. “I have a little soreness,” he said with a smile, referring to a recent injection. “Then I tell everyone, ‘Yup, I just got mine.’ The casualness of that comment made a difference: It made PrEP feel normal, relatable, something for ‘us,’ not something done to ‘them.’” These social exchanges, rooted in trust and shared experience, frequently did more to shift attitudes than traditional public health campaigns. As one participant put it, “I trust my friends more than those ads. If they’re taking it and it works for them, that means something to me.” Making PrEP culturally relevant What these conversations show is that for PrEP to work in the South, access to treatment is only part of the equation. Building trust, cultural affirmation and community-led education are equally critical. Public health messages that go beyond medical facts and address the emotional, spiritual and social dimensions of health are more likely to build lasting engagement with HIV prevention. This includes investing in Black, LGBTQ+-affirming health care providers who reflect the communities they serve . It also means integrating discussions of sexual health into everyday conversations at barbershops , churches and community centers , not just in clinics. Public health officials and clinicians can explore alternative treatment delivery methods that address privacy concerns, such as telehealth PrEP programs, discreet mail-order services and community-based distribution points. These can make PrEP easier to access and reduce the stigma associated with clinic visits. Most importantly, valuing the knowledge already circulating within communities and supporting peer educators as legitimate public health messengers can strengthen credibility, normalize PrEP and empower people to take charge of their health. In the battle against HIV in the South, culture is not just a barrier. It can also be the solution. I believe that when care is offered in a way that honors people’s identities, experiences and values, it becomes not just accessible but empowering.",https://theconversation.com/hiv-rates-are-highest-in-the-american-south-despite-effective-treatments-a-clash-between-culture-and-public-health-257434,Society,theconversation.com,Brandon Nabors,https://images.theconversation.com/files/696252/original/file-20251014-56-rh7k82.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&rect=0%2C170%2C1024%2C512&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop,2025-10-16T12:40:21+00:00,0da987a20205f55f86f0e76146b6560d8513e7d1
b08db9809f8f,"Zombies, jiangshi, draugrs, revenants − monster lore is filled with metaphors for public health","apocalypse, epidemiology, infection, infectious diseases, pandemic, public health, zombies","Imagine a city street at dusk, silent save for the rising sound of a collective guttural moan. Suddenly, a horde of ragged, bloodied creatures appear, their feet shuffling along the pavement, their hollow eyes locked on fleeing figures ahead. A classic movie monster, the zombie surged in popularity in the 21st century during a time of global anxiety – the Great Recession, the specter of climate change, the lingering trauma of the 9/11 terrorist attacks and the COVID-19 pandemic. The zombie apocalypse became a way for people to explore the terrifying concept of societal collapse , a step removed from real threats such as nuclear war or global financial disaster. As a public health epidemiologist and an amateur zombie historian, I couldn’t help but notice the striking parallels between what epidemiologists do to stop infectious disease outbreaks and what horror movie heroes do to stop zombies. The key questions posed in any zombie narrative – how did this start, how many are infected, how to contain it – are the identical questions that epidemiologists ask during a real infectious disease outbreak or pandemic. In 2011, in fact, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention published a zombie apocalypse preparedness guide that explained how readying oneself for a zombie apocalypse can prepare people for any large-scale disaster. The zombie is more than just a monster; it is a powerful, public health teaching tool. Zombies in ancient history The idea of the reanimated dead has been part of human history for millennia, showing up across cultures and long before modern germ theory or epidemiology existed . These creatures were often a way for societies to understand and explain the natural world and disease transmission in the absence of scientific knowledge. The oldest written reference to creatures similar to modern zombies is found in “ The Epic of Gilgamesh ,” which was etched on stone tablets sometime between 2000 and 1100 B.C.E. Enraged after Gilgamesh rejects her marriage proposal, the goddess Ishtar tells him, “I shall bring up the dead to consume the living, I shall the make the dead outnumber the living.” This ancient terror – the dead overwhelming the living – has a direct parallel to the concept of an out-of-control epidemic in which the sick quickly overwhelm the healthy. Hollywood has readily adopted this concept in many zombie movies. The creatures in George Romero’s 1968 classic ‘The Night of the Living Dead’ were the first flesh-eating zombies in Hollywood. Wikimedia Commons The origins of the flesh-eating corpse on screen date back to George Romero’s 1968 classic “ The Night of the Living Dead .” You won’t hear the word “zombie” in Romero’s film, however – in the script, he called the creatures “flesh eaters.” Similarly, in Danny Boyle’s 2002 film “ 28 Days Later ,” the terrifying creatures were called the “infected.” Both these terms, “flesh eaters” and “infected,” directly echo public health concerns – specifically, the spread of disease via a bacteria or virus and the need for quarantine to contain the afflicted. The roots of the word zombie arefor the Haitian variety. thought to stretch back to West Africa and to words such as “ nzambi,” which means “creator” in African Kongo , or “ ndzumbi,” which means “corpse” in the Mitsogo language of Gabon. However, it was in Haitian Vodou, a religion that draws from the West African spiritual traditions among people who were enslaved on Haiti’s plantations, that the concept took its most terrifying form . According to Vodou, when a person experiences an unnatural, early death, priests can capture and co-opt their soul. Slave owners capitalized on this belief to prevent suicide among the enslaved . To become a zombie – dead yet still a slave – was the ultimate nightmare. This cultural concept speaks not just to disease but to societal trauma and the public health crisis of forced labor. Zombie-like creatures around the world Across the globe, other reanimated corpses crop up in local folklore , often reflecting fears of improper burial, violent death or moral wickedness. Many tales about these eerie creatures don’t just convey how to avoid becoming one of them, but also detail how to stop or prevent them from taking over. This focus on prevention and control is at the heart of public health. Jiangshi, or hopping zombies, were corpses reanimated when a soul couldn’t leave after a violent death. Ed5005000 via Sleeping Dogs Wiki , CC BY-SA During the expansion of China’s Qing dynasty , which took place between 1644 and 1911, a creature known as the jiangshi, or “hopping zombie,” emerged amid widespread unrest and integration of non-Chinese minorities . The jiangshi were corpses suffering from rigor mortis and decomposition , reanimated when a soul couldn’t leave after a violent death. Instead of staggering, these mythological creatures would hop, and their method of attack was to steal a person’s lifeforce, or qi. Fear of a lonely, restless afterlife led families who lost a loved one far from home to hire a Taoist priest to retrieve the body for proper burial with ancestors. In Scandinavia, the draugr – meaning “again walker” or “ghost” – was a creature bent on revenge . According to lore, draugrs typically emerged from mean-spirited people or improperly buried corpses. Like zombies, they could turn regular people into draugrs by infecting them. They would attack their victims by devouring flesh, drinking blood or driving victims insane. Draugrs’ contagious nature is a model for disease transmission. What’s more, their seasonal activity – they most often appear at night in winter months –  is similar to seasonal trends in infectious disease transmission . The draugr’s ability to ‘infect’ people can be seen as an example of disease transmission. Kim Diaz Holm , CC BY-SA In medieval times, meanwhile, legend had it that creatures called revenants – corpses that came out of their graves – stalked northern and western Europe. According to 12th-century English historian William of Newburgh, these creatures emerged from the lingering life force of people who had committed evil deeds during their lives or who experienced a sudden death. Clerics fueled people’s fears of becoming a revenant by claiming these creatures were created by Satan. The recommended but gruesome prevention method for this fate was to capture and dismember these creatures and to burn the body parts, especially the head. Archaeological evidence from a medieval village in England suggests that communities heeded this advice. Archaeologists excavated the village’s burial grounds, and among human remains from the 11th to 13th centuries they found broken and burned bones with knife marks . They show how a community may have taken extreme measures to control a perceived contagion or threat to public safety, mirroring a modern-day quarantine or eradication protocols. Perhaps the most striking similarity between these historical monsters and Hollywood zombies is that so many of them are created by an infectious agent of some kind. After an outbreak occurs, control is difficult to regain, underscoring the necessity of a rapid public health response.",https://theconversation.com/zombies-jiangshi-draugrs-revenants-monster-lore-is-filled-with-metaphors-for-public-health-261448,Society,theconversation.com,Tom Duszynski,https://images.theconversation.com/files/695304/original/file-20251009-56-j0d37e.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&rect=0%2C52%2C5760%2C2880&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop,2025-10-16T12:39:21+00:00,42325bf5eed8f574bb891824f3ed66126e43ed75

However, we also found that the majority of them give up their home to someone else, either selling it or leaving a rental home, rather than taking a government buyout offer. That transfers the risk to a new resident, leaving the community still facing future costly risks. FEMA’s buyout program at risk Government buyout programs can help communities recover after disasters by purchasing high-risk homes and demolishing them. The parcel is then converted to a natural flood plain, park or site for new infrastructure to mitigate future flood damage for nearby areas. FEMA has been funding such efforts for decades through its property buyout program . It has invested nearly US$4 billion to purchase and raze approximately 45,000 flood-prone homes nationwide, most of them since 2001. Those investments pay off: Research shows the program avoids an estimated $4 to $6 in future disaster recovery spending for every $1 invested . In return, homeowners receive a predisaster price for their home, minus any money they might receive from a related flood insurance payout on the property. Young trees along Briar Creek in Charlotte, N.C., are part of a successful local flood plain buyout program to purchase property in flood-prone areas and return it to nature. Eamon Queeney/The Washington Post via Getty Images But this assistance is now in jeopardy as the Trump administration cuts FEMA staff and funding and the president talks about dismantling the agency . From March to September, governors submitted 42 applications for funding from FEMA’s Hazard Mitigation Grant Program, which includes buyouts – all were denied or left pending as of mid-September. Our recommendation after studying this program is to mend it, not end it. If done right, buyouts can help maintain local ties and help communities build more sustainable futures together. Buyouts vs. selling homes in damaged areas Our team at Rice University’s Center for Coastal Futures and Adaptive Resilience developed an interactive mapping tool to show where buyout participants and neighbors living within a half-mile of them moved after FEMA initiates a buyout program in their area. The maps were created using individual data, down to the address level, from 2007 to 2017, across more than 550 counties where FEMA’s buyout program operated nationally. Zoomed out, they show just how many places the program has helped across the U.S., from coastal cities to inland towns. And, when zoomed in, they reveal the buyout locations and destinations of more than 70,000 residents who moved following FEMA-funded buyouts in their area. FEMA’s buyout programs have helped homeowners and communities across the U.S., in almost every state. James R. Elliott , CC BY The maps also show which people relocated by accepting a federal buyout and which ones relocated on their own. Nationwide, we see the vast majority of movers, about 14 out of every 15, are not participants in the federal buyout program. They are neighbors who relocated through conventional real estate transactions. This distinction matters, because it implies that most Americans are retreating from climate-stressed areas by transferring their home’s risk to someone else, not by accepting buyouts that would take the property out of circulation. Selling may be good for homeowners who can find buyers, but it doesn’t make the community more resilient. A map of buyouts in Sayreville, N.J., shows most people didn’t move far away. James R. Elliott , CC BY Lessons for future buyout programs Our interactive map offers some good news and insights for buyout programs going forward. Regardless of how they occur, we find that moves from buyout areas average just 5 to 10 miles from old to new home. This means most people are maintaining local ties, even as they relocate to adapt to rising climate risks. Nearly all of the moves also end in safer homes with minimal to minor risk of future flooding. We checked using address-level flood factors from the First Street Foundation, a nonprofit source of flood risk ratings that are now integrated into some online real estate websites . But many homes in risky areas are still being resold or rented to new residents, leaving communities facing a game of climate roulette. How long that can continue will vary by neighborhood. Rising insurance costs, intensifying storms and growing awareness of flood risks are already dampening home sales in some communities − and thus opportunities to simply hand over one’s risk to someone else and move on. The U.S. can create safer communities by expanding federal, state and local voluntary buyout programs. These programs allow communities to reduce future flood damage and collectively plan for safer uses of the vacated lands that emerge. Giving residents longer periods of time to participate after the damage could also help make the programs more attractive. This would provide property owners more flexibility in deciding when to sell and demolish their property, while still taking risky property off the market rather than handing the risk to new residents.",https://theconversation.com/fema-buyouts-vs-risky-real-estate-new-maps-reveal-post-flood-migration-patterns-across-the-us-262211,Society,theconversation.com,Debolina Banerjee,https://images.theconversation.com/files/695690/original/file-20251010-56-pcw0o7.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&rect=0%2C688%2C4027%2C2013&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop,2025-10-16T12:34:05+00:00,dfccd8160a98f98f0d9878a0014e4f16b4776266

2c8fba5183f2,Israel’s exploding robots still terrorise Gaza neighbourhoods,"features, news, crimes against humanity, gaza, human rights, israel-palestine conflict, middle east, palestine","Gaza City – The ceasefire between Israel and Hamas brought thousands of people back to their homes in Gaza City, to assess the damage, see what can be salvaged, and start to rebuild. In Jabalia, Sheikh Radwan, Abu Iskandar and beyond, people returned to flattened neighbourhoods, and to the knowledge that, still among the rubble, some of the explosive robots that had caused it sat, silent and undetonated. Recommended Stories list of 3 items end of list People aren’t sure where all the undetonated robots lurk, nor do they know what to do if they encounter one, adding to the anguish and uncertainty that clouds this homecoming. Exploding robots The “robots” had become a common fear in northern Gaza since the Israeli army first used them on Jabalia refugee camp in May 2024. Their deployment hit an “unprecedented pace” leading up to the October ceasefire, the Euro-Med Human Rights Monitor noted in a report on September 1, adding that they were used to destroy “about 300 residential units daily in Gaza City and Jabalia”. The robots are armoured carriers that Israeli soldiers would load with explosives, then drag into place using armoured bulldozers. Once the soldiers had retreated, they would remotely detonate the booby-trapped vehicle, destroying everything around it. Not much is known about the payload – or if it was ever consistent – Gaza City Civil Defence spokesman Mahmoud Basal told Al Jazeera. However, their destructive capacity was apparent, Bassal said, describing the robots’ “kill radius” which he said extended as far as 500 metres (550 yards). The damage to infrastructure, he added, was “staggering”. Palestinians continue returning north on the second day of the ceasefire in the Gaza Strip, with those arriving in Gaza City’s Sheikh Radwan neighbourhood finding widespread devastation after the Israeli army’s withdrawal, Gaza City, October 11 [Abdalrahman T. A. Abusalama/ Anadolu Agency] ‘Nothing remained’ Last November, Sharif Shadi realised he had not yet learned all the sounds of war. The sounds of air attacks, artillery, and rockets were etched into his memory from countless Israeli wars on Gaza since childhood. But during Israel’s brutal ground assault on northern Gaza, the 22-year-old from Jabalia refugee camp heard a new, more horrifying sound. It was the sound of the robots. Shortly after, the devices explode, swallowing entire neighbourhoods. “The explosive robot enters a complete residential block … and moments later, everything is reduced into bits of rubble,” Shadi explains of the Israeli military’s latest weapon. On that November morning, Shadi was in the street, going about the daunting daily quest of securing essentials for himself and his family of eight other members, when he saw a robot being dragged towards his neighbourhood by a D10 bulldozer. “They entered the block, and I started running away. “I ran at least 100 metres (110 yards), and suddenly found myself under rubble, the explosion was that strong. Those who were closer, nothing remained of them – not even remains or body parts.” Days later, he lost a friend. “My friend was unwell and needed to go to Kamal Adwan Hospital. I accompanied him, and on the way, we saw a robot coming in. In a moment of sheer panic and chaos, my friend and I ran in different directions. “The blast was immense and rocked the earth beneath my feet. When I went back to that same spot where I had last seen my friend … I found no trace of him. His body was completely vapourised.” According to Euro-Med’s report, these devices’ indiscriminate, widespread destruction puts them “under the category of prohibited arms, and their use in populated areas constitutes both a war crime and a crime against humanity”. Neither the Israeli military nor the government have publically acknowledged the use of these weapons, although some Israeli media outlets have reported on their use. The Israeli military has not responded to a request for comment from Al Jazeera. Toxic aftermath, respiratory crisis The effect doesn’t end with the explosion, as Dr Mohammed Abu Afash, director of the Palestinian Medical Relief Society in Gaza, explains. The “explosive robots” leave behind toxic vapours and gases, he says, “a powerful foul smell” that lingers and causes people serious respiratory problems. “Repeated cases of suffocation and breathing difficulties have appeared, and citizens continue to suffer from these symptoms due to inhaling toxic gases believed to contain lead and dangerous chemicals,” he adds. Um Ahmed al-Dreimli, who lives in Sabra in Gaza City, described the smell as “a mixture of gunpowder and burned metal that clung to our lungs, making our breathing difficult long after the explosion”. The 50-year-old mother of three – her eldest is 10-year-old Ahmed – was with her family in her damaged childhood home when she heard neighbours’ screams from the street, alerting her to the danger. The explosions came shortly after, with Israel giving no warning or time to flee. The sound of the explosion was different, Um Ahmed said. It had a heavy metallic rumble, not like “the sounds of hovering jets or drones, nor the screech of approaching missiles, which we’ve gotten used to … and it felt as if the ground was being pulled from under our feet”, she recalls. A drone view shows Palestinian houses and buildings lying in ruins, following a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas, in Rafah in the southern Gaza Strip, January 22, 2025 [Mohammed Salem/Reuters] A prelude to invasion Mohammed Abu Tamous from the Civil Defence and Ambulance media department has seen explosive robots multiple times during fieldwork. “When planning to invade a specific area, the army uses these robots to level buildings and erase landmarks in preparation for advancing vehicles,” he adds. He says they have been used across northern Gaza, including Jabalia camp, Beit Hanoon, Tal az-Zaatar, Beit Lahiya, Tuffah neighbourhood, Shujayea, Zeitoun, Sabra, Sheikh Radwan, Abu Iskandar, and Jabalia downtown. There is no whistle of an incoming rocket or air raid siren – just the explosion, followed by huge plumes of white smoke. “Air strikes on an apartment or building might affect two or three neighbouring houses, but the robot destroys a complete row of 10 adjacent houses,” Abu Tamous says. He added that Israeli soldiers use these explosive robots in crowded residential areas that they have surrounded and cut off, so they can prevent ambulance and civil defence teams from entering to help people. Even when rescue teams are allowed in, often the damage is so severe that they can no longer figure out landmarks or where streets begin or end. During the January ceasefire, he added, the team found an unexploded robot in Tal el-Zaatar and was able to examine its contents. “There was a yellow, paste-like substance in a container that we couldn’t identify, but it has stood out from all the explosives we’ve seen,” he says. Now that people are returning to Gaza City, Abu Tamous is worried because he has seen unexploded robots, and he and his team can do very little about them. “All we can do is tape off a perimeter and warn people not to approach, but there’s nothing else in our hands,” he said. “We do tell the specialised bomb disposal unit, but they would need more equipment to be brought into Gaza to deal with this.” This piece was published in collaboration with Egab .",https://www.aljazeera.com/features/2025/10/16/israels-exploding-robots-still-terrorise-gaza-neighbourhoods,World,aljazeera.com,,https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/s1-1760602866.jpg?resize=1200%2C675,,39e2b7724ccfa8f758d7fe1269dd4926c5383fa9

2a81ee5b93cb,Ukraine’s Zelenskyy to meet Trump as Russia focuses on Donetsk offensive,"news, russia-ukraine war, europe, russia, ukraine","Russia is increasing air attacks to compensate for its failure to crack Ukrainian defences on the ground, according to Kyiv. “Russia has started a new wave of air terror against Ukraine – against our cities and civilian infrastructure,” Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy told NATO’s 71st Parliamentary Assembly on October 13. Recommended Stories list of 4 items end of list Zelenskyy spoke days after Russia launched an overnight strike against Ukraine’s energy infrastructure involving 465 drones and 19 missiles. A boy with a bicycle looks on near buildings damaged during a Russian drone and missile strike in the town of Brovary, outside of Kyiv, October 10, 2025 [Alina Smutko/Reuters] Ukraine said it downed 405 of the drones and 15 missiles. The remainder deprived three-quarters of a million Ukrainians of electricity for the day, wounded 20 people and killed a seven-year-old boy. Zelenskyy said cold autumn weather had reduced the effectiveness of Ukraine’s air defences by 20-30 percent, claiming Russia “deliberately waited” for this. On Wednesday, Russian drones again knocked out power in some parts of Ukraine and struck a thermal power plant, according to Naftogaz, Ukraine’s gas utility. Russia ‘increased the number of air attack means’ On the battlefront, too, Russia was turning to the air. “In a month, the enemy has increased the number of air attack means used by 1.3 times,” wrote Ukrainian commander-in-chief Oleksandr Syrskii on his Telegram channel on Saturday. Syrskii generally refers to Russian first-person view (FPV) drones and air-launched glide bombs, which Russia uses at the front in addition to artillery and multiple launch rocket systems. But Russia was increasingly using its long-range Shahed drones – the type it deploys against cities – to hit targets at the front as well, said the Kyiv Independent after speaking with analysts. Shaheds are more precise than glide bombs, and Russia was “likely looking to conserve KAB guided aerial bombs where possible to prepare for a long war ahead”, said the newspaper. An Orthodox priest blesses Russian conscripts called up for military service during a ceremony marking the departure for garrisons from a recruitment centre in Saint Petersburg, Russia, October 15, 2025 [Anton Vaganov/Reuters] Russia’s tactics prompted a flurry of consultations with allies. On the day of the massive air strike, Zelenskyy said he spoke with United States President Donald Trump about the damage to Ukraine’s energy sector and what the nation needs to protect it. During the week, he also spoke with the leaders of Canada, Germany, the United Kingdom and France, and the European Union’s foreign policy chief, Kaja Kallas. Zelenskyy said he is short of air defences and has asked allies to increase provisions to protect 203 key facilities in Ukraine. At Wednesday’s meeting of the Defence Contact Group for Ukraine, Germany pledged 2.3 billion euros ($2.7bn) in new weapons and air defence systems, including interceptors for Patriot launchers and two more IRIS-T systems. Poland offered electricity exports, generators and the services of a liquefied natural gas (LNG) terminal to bolster Ukraine’s energy supply. Zelenskyy dispatched Prime Minister Yulia Svyrydenko to the US to lay the groundwork for his meeting with Trump on Friday. Russia’s fight for Donetsk On the ground, Zelenskyy said this week that Russia had planned to capture the entirety of the Donetsk region this autumn. About a quarter of it remains in Ukraine’s hands. The hammer has fallen hardest on Pokrovsk, once a city of 60,000 people. Russia has failed to take it by direct assault and by conducting an enveloping manoeuvre through Dobropillia to its north. Syrskii said a Ukrainian counteroffensive at Dobropillia had retaken 181sq km (70sq miles) of territory since the end of August. The Dobropillia counteroffensive caused 12,000 Russian casualties, including 7,000 deaths, and upset Russia’s plans to conquer Donetsk this autumn, Zelenskyy claimed. Al Jazeera was unable to independently verify the death toll estimated by Ukraine. Ukraine’s operation “disrupted all the plans that the Russians communicated to the American side, claiming they would supposedly occupy the Donbas – most of it – specifically by November. Initially, they said September, then pushed the deadline to November”, said Zelenskyy. Russia’s determination to capture Donetsk was evident in the fact that it had returned to high-casualty mechanised assaults on October 6, 9 and 13, said the Institute for the Study of War, a Washington-based think tank, having largely stopped reinforced company-sized mechanised assaults in late 2024. All three assaults came in the Dobropillia direction and were defeated with high losses to men and armour. “The Russians are now tasked with urgently taking Pokrovsk – at any cost,” Zelenskyy said, and some analysts suggested they may be swinging to the south of Pokrovsk instead. Russia has not been wholly without success. During the week of October 9-15, it claimed to have seized four villages in Donetsk, and settlements in Kharkiv and Dnipropetrovsk. In Kharkiv, Zelenskyy said, Ukrainian forces were pushing Russian troops out of some positions in the city of Kupiansk, in whose northwestern outskirts they have taken positions. Despite this, Ukrainian authorities on Wednesday evacuated hundreds of families from 27 villages in the Kupiansk area, citing the security situation. Ukraine’s strikes and Tomahawks Ukraine continued a successful campaign to choke off Russian fuel production. Its drones struck Lukoil’s Korobkovsky Gas Processing Plant in the Volgograd region of Russia on October 9. “The plant is part of the fuel supply system for the domestic market of the Russian Federation, as well as for export,” said Andriy Kovalenko, head of Ukraine’s Center for Countering Disinformation. On Monday, Ukraine struck the oil depot at the port of Feodosia in Crimea, confirmed the region’s occupation head, Sergey Aksyonov. It is used to supply Russian occupying troops in Crimea, Zaporizhia and Kharkiv with fuel by rail. Russian opposition news outlet Astra said the strikes damaged 11 fuel tanks, including eight 5,000-10,000-tonne diesel tanks and two petrol tanks. Geolocated footage confirmed the attack, as well as strikes on two electricity substations in Feodosia and Simferopol, also in Crimea. “This is absolutely fair that Ukraine strikes back with precise, targeted attacks,” said Zelenskyy. The Financial Times reported on Sunday that Ukraine has not been conducting these operations alone. Several US and Ukrainian officials told the daily that Washington has been providing intelligence for the targeting of Russian refineries for months. (Al Jazeera) “The shift came after a phone call between Donald Trump and Volodymyr Zelenskyy in July, when the FT reported the US president asked whether Ukraine could strike Moscow if Washington provided long-range weapons,” wrote the paper. The sources said the US was involved in target selection, timing and route planning to evade Russian air defences. Ukraine has so far mostly used its domestically produced drones, and Zelenskyy last month asked Trump to provide US Tomahawk cruise missiles , with a range of up to 2,500km (1,550 miles) The issue is to be among those discussed between Trump and Zelenskyy on Friday. Russia’s deputy chairman of its National Security Council warned against the deployment of Tomahawks, which are nuclear-capable. “The delivery of those missiles would not be good for anyone. First and foremost, it will end badly for Trump himself,” warned Dmitry Medvedev in a written post.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/16/ukraines-zelenskyy-to-meet-trump-as-russia-focuses-on-donetsk-offensive,World,aljazeera.com,John T Psaropoulos,https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2025-10-10T044611Z_1563552488_RC2S8HAI0FV5_RTRMADP_3_UKRAINE-CRISIS-ATTACK-KYIV-1760622803.jpg?resize=1920%2C1440,,c67468c87efda569d88b527f6e1553fa7a559846
976679088735,UN urges ‘lasting’ ceasefire after Pakistan-Afghanistan clashes kill dozens,"news, politics, taliban, afghanistan, asia, pakistan","The United Nations has called on the warring Afghan and Pakistani military forces to permanently end hostilities, after a 48-hour ceasefire took effect following days of skirmishes that killed dozens and injured more than 100 others. In a statement issued on Thursday, the UN Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA) welcomed the announcement of a ceasefire and called on all parties “to bring a lasting end to hostilities to protect civilians and prevent further loss of life”. Recommended Stories list of 3 items end of list It also urged both Afghanistan and Pakistan to comply with their obligations under international law “to prevent” more civilian casualties. The recent deadly clashes between the two neighbouring countries and former allies erupted last week after Pakistan struck targets inside Afghanistan, including in the capital Kabul. Pakistan had been demanding that the Afghan Taliban administration act to rein in armed groups who had stepped up attacks in Pakistan, saying they operated from havens in Afghanistan. In retaliation for the attacks, Afghan forces attacked Pakistani soldiers, accusing them of violating their territory. The Taliban has accused the Pakistani military of spreading misinformation about Afghanistan, provoking border tensions, and sheltering ISIL (ISIS)-linked groups to undermine the country’s stability and sovereignty. On Thursday, Karimullah Zubair Agha, director of public health in Afghanistan’s Spin Boldak, said clashes along the border areas killed 40 civilians just shortly before a truce took effect on Wednesday. “We have 170 wounded and 40 killed, all civilians,” the official told the AFP news agency. The fighting along the volatile, contested frontier has been described as the worst violence between the two nations since the Taliban seized power in Kabul in 2021 after the United States’s withdrawal. In its latest statement on Thursday, UNAMA said it received “credible reports of significant civilian casualties” including women and children, just shortly before the ceasefire. Most of the casualties were reportedly from the Spin Boldak district of Kandahar, UNAMA said, confirming at least 17 civilians killed and as many as 346 others injured. Meanwhile, Pakistan’s military has claimed that they have foiled an attempt by suspected Pakistan Taliban fighters to take advantage of the ceasefire and launch an attack on government forces in the border province of Ķhyber Pakhtunkhawa. The military claimed that dozens of Pakistan Taliban fighters, know by the acronym TTP, were killed in the attack. Perilous deportation for Afghan refugees? As the fragile ceasefire continues to hold on Thursday, Pakistan has ordered the closure of Afghan refugee camps within its border. Al Jazeera’s Kamal Hyder, reporting from Pakistan’s Torkham Crossing just across the border from Afghanistan, said that the UNHCR have expressed “deep concern” about the decision that could strip Afghans of their refugee status. “People say they have been living here for decades, and their livelihoods are at stake,” Hyder said, adding that Afghans are demanding a “dignified return” back to their home country. Hyder noted that there are an estimated two million Afghan refugees who fled to Pakistan during previous wars, and ordering them to leave within the next seven days could trigger an “enormous” refugee problem, and put many “in a very difficult predicament”. For now, residents along the border between Afghanistan and Pakistan are hoping that the ceasefire will be extended beyond its original 48-hour timeframe, but the situation on the ground makes it difficult to see how that can be achieved, Hyder noted. “But everybody is still hoping that the conflict will end and that the two sides will be able to resolve the key issues,” he said.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/16/un-urges-lasting-ceasefire-after-pakistan-afghanistan-clashes-kill-dozens,World,aljazeera.com,"Al Jazeera Staff,News Agencies",https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2025-10-16T101135Z_1138065367_RC2YCHAYJF1L_RTRMADP_3_PAKISTAN-AFGHANISTAN-1-1760618253.jpg?resize=1920%2C1440,,53612176c41e888cf1b7921a49523f974bcaa572

The company, acquired by Scott Leiendecker, a former Republican Party operative and election director in Missouri before founding Knowink, said in a press release that he was rebranding Dominion, which has headquarters in Canada and the United States, under the name Liberty Vote “in a bold and historic move to transform and improve election integrity in America” and to distance the company from false allegations made previously by President Donald Trump and his supporters that the company had rigged the 2020 presidential election to give the win to President Joe Biden. The Liberty release said that the rebranded company will be 100 percent American owned, that it will have a “paper ballot focus” that leverages hand-marked paper ballots, will “prioritize facilitating third-party auditing,” and is “committed to domestic staffing and software development.” The press release provided no details, however, to explain what this means in practice. Dominion, the second leading provider of voting machines in the US, whose systems are used in 27 states—including the entire state of Georgia—has developed its software in Belgrade, Serbia and Canada for two decades. A search on LinkedIn shows numerous programmers and other workers in Serbia who claim to be employed by the company. The Liberty statement does not say whether the company plans to re-write code developed by these foreign workers—which would potentially involve rewriting hundreds of thousands of lines of code—or whether the company will move foreign developers to the US or replace them with American programmers. (Dominion already has a US headquarters in Colorado.) A Liberty official, who agreed to speak on the condition that they not be named, told WIRED only that Leiendecker “is committed to 100 percent … domestic staffing and software development.” An unnamed source told CNN, however, that Liberty will continue to have a presence in Canada, where its machines are used across the country. Philip Stark, professor of statistics at UC Berkeley and longtime election-integrity advocate, says that Liberty’s assurance about domestic-only workers is a red herring. “If the claim is that this is somehow a security measure, it isn’t. Because programmers based in the US also … may be interested in undermining or altering election integrity,” he tells WIRED. With regard to third-party audits mentioned in the press release, a Liberty official told WIRED this means the company will conduct a “third-party, top-to-bottom, independent review of [Dominion] software and equipment in a timely manner and will work closely with federal and state certification agencies and report any vulnerabilities” to give voters assurance in the machines and the results they produce.

They were burly, stiff, and difficult to break in, but one pair would last you decades. Technology has mercifully caught up, however. If you head to the trails today, most hikers and backpackers are opting for more lightweight, low-cut options. While an influx of new shoes from brands like Hoka, Merrell, Danner, and Salomon has transformed the footwear industry, that doesn’t mean the hiking boot has had its day. It just depends on what you’re looking to do and when you’re doing it. Which shoes should you pick to go out for the day? I tested countless pairs of great hiking boots , trail runners and hiking shoes, across a variety of terrain, from forest trails and coastal paths, to high alpine terrain. To get a better understanding of the differences between the many options available—and which is right for you—I grilled Ingrid Johnson, a leading footwear product specialist at REI . (For what it's worth, Johnson's personal recommendation is the Salomon XA Pro ). When you’ve chosen your next pair of trail running shoes (or hiking boots), be sure to check out more of WIRED's outdoor guides , like the Best Running Shoes , Best Puffer Jackets , and Best Hiking Backpacks . Jump to Section AccordionItemContainerButton Here's When You Need Boots If you're carrying a heavy pack over rough terrain, or if it's wet or snowy, you need hiking boots. They tend to be higher at the ankle, with stiff midsoles, protective toe caps, and are generally made from very durable materials like leather and tough synthetic fabrics like Cordura. Hiking boots prioritize stability, protection, and durability. Boots generally have thick, deep lugs, tougher soles, stronger toe guards, sturdier ankle support. They protect you from rock impact, uneven ground, moisture, and often colder conditions. The high cut designs also offer more ankle support, something I found reassuring when coming back from a recent injury. But don’t think that hiking boot brands are stuck in the dark ages. Borrowing lightweight features and materials from trail running, brands are able to offer technical boots with cushioning, grip and stability. They’re still heavy, but featherweight compared to a traditional leather boot. Hoka’s Kaha 3 GTX ($240) is one of the best boots available, blending soft nubuck leather, Vibram Megagrip sole and bags of cushioning. Here are a few other picks. Perennially popular for good reason, these Salomons boast superb levels of comfort and support without the bulk typically associated with traditional walking boots. They feel like ski boots, but that’s not a criticism, the height and support is most welcome when walking all day carrying a full pack. The suede leather and rubberized toe-cap make them impressively robust, they’re easy to clean, and the Gore-Tex liner offers complete waterproofing. The outsole is deep, aggressive, and impervious to unexpected slips, and top marks go to the metal lacing system, especially the middle eyelet that grips the laces securely. They’re not as forgiving underfoot as many of the newer running-shoe-inspired designs, but there’s plenty of shock absorption in the ball and heel. Arc'teryx Kopec Mid GTX Boot You pay handsomely for the privilege, but the Kopec is a hugely versatile, waterproof boot for all seasons. Made from 100 percent nylon Cordura, the upper is very durable and gives the boot quite a stiff, secure feel, despite weighing just 11.9 ounces for a size eight. Designed for day hikes over varied terrain, they impressed me with a great mix of stability and cushioning. If you're not a fan of the pillowy feel of trail running shoes, these hit the sweet spot. They have out-the-box comfort, which is rare with a stiffer boot, and they feel really secure when scrambling and walking. The security in the heel and ankle is matched by a Vibram Megagrip rubber sole with mud loving 4-mm lugs. I'm a big fan of this rubber compound, and here the lugs have been arranged to give the most grip for the least weight. After months of regular wear—on and off the trails—they still look remarkably fresh, and I appreciate being able to simply hose them down to wash away the mud. Yes they're expensive for day hikers, but the materials used do offer a genuine crossover between old and new designs, without compromising on style or performance. Mammut Kento Tour High GTX Serious alpine terrain demands respect, and if you’re going to be encountering snow, ice, rocks and steep climbs, you need a mountaineering boot. Weighing 1 pound, 5.8 ounces per boot (9.5) the Kento Tour, from Swiss pioneers Mammut, offers a surprisingly agile mix of stiff soled support, grip and protection. Given the height and stiffness, it’s a remarkably comfortable boot, and despite the big 11 millimeter drop, it's easy to stick to your natural stride. This is about as far from a trail running shoe as you can get—it’s crampon-compatible, for one thing—but it does have out-of-the box comfort, and just enough flex to stop it feeling like a ski boot. Gore-Tex takes care of the waterproofing, and the velour leather upper and approach shoe style lacing system means you can really dial in the fit.",https://www.wired.com/story/should-you-hike-in-boots-or-trail-runners,Technology,wired.com,Chris Haslam,"https://media.wired.com/photos/68f073964674bf2fa8e2ea85/191:100/w_1280,c_limit/Should%20You%20Hike%20in%20Boots%20or%20Trail%20Runners_.png",2025-10-16T14:00:00+00:00,d5c58ff157d5ef39a5d626f442b9d3af54004057
3620c011c4be,'Most pristine' star ever seen discovered at the Milky Way's edge — and could be a direct descendant of the universe's first stars,,"Astronomers may have just discovered the ""most pristine"" star ever seen, lurking near the edge of the Milky Way . The unusual alien sun, which could be the offspring of one of the universe's first stars, is so metal-poor that it breaks a major rule of star formation. All known stars are powered by nuclear fusion , which forces the atoms of lighter elements together under immense pressure, fusing them into heavier elements and emitting large amounts of energy in the process. The most common example of this is hydrogen, the most abundant element in stars, fusing into helium, the second-most abundant element in stars. But at the very heart of stars, you can also find other fused elements including carbon , oxygen and iron — the latter of which is the most abundant metal in stars. Heavier metals such as gold , copper and uranium are created when dying stars explode in supernovas, and can also be found within most stars. But not all stars are created equally. Some stars have a much higher concentration of heavy elements, or metallicity, than others. This is largely determined by which materials have been left behind by exploded stars in their region of space. The stars with low metallicity, often dubbed ""pristine,"" are highly sought after by astronomers because they are most similar to the universe's very first stars, which have never been directly observed . In a new study, uploaded Sept. 25 to the preprint server arXiv , a group of researchers revealed the discovery of a new star, named SDSS J0715-7334, which has the lowest metallicity of any star ever seen, by a significant margin. It was spotted using the MINESweeper program, which searches for stars among data collected by the European Space Agency 's now-retired Gaia space telescope. The newly discovered star, which is a red giant around 30 times more massive than the sun, is almost twice as pristine as the previous lowest metallicity star and has more than 10 times less metal than the most iron-poor star seen to date, according to initial spectrographs of its light. It now holds both of these records, researchers wrote. Most elements heavier than iron are created during supernovas, and are then inherited by new stars that form from the material leftover from these stellar explosions. (Image credit: NASA, ESA, Leah Hustak (STScI)) J0715-7334 is likely around 85,000 light-years from Earth, although its exact distance is hard to calculate at this point, the researchers note. That puts it just within the Milky Way . However, the angular momentum of the star hints that it originated from the Large Magellanic Cloud — a dwarf galaxy containing around 30 billion stars that closely orbits the Milky Way — before falling into our galaxy. What makes J0715-7334 particularly intriguing is that it also has a low concentration of carbon. Most other iron-poor stars have a relatively high ratio of carbon, which keeps their overall metallicity high. (This is why the previous most iron-poor star did not also hold the record for lowest metallicity, as carbon is counted toward metallicity despite not being a metal.) Get the world’s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox. This extremely low metallicity points to J0715-7334 being a direct descendant of a first-generation star, which was formed from the primordial clouds of hydrogen leftover after the Big Bang . This provides other researchers with a window to look back to the very start of stellar evolution. J0715-7334 likely originates from a star forming region within the Large Magellanic Cloud. (Image credit: NASA, ESA, and Martino Romaniello (European Southern Observatory, Germany)) The new discovery could also help researchers work out how such metal-poor stars take shape, which should, in theory, be impossible. J0715-7334 is now the second known star whose metallicity falls below what researchers call the ""fine structure cooling threshold."" This threshold states the minimum amount of heavy elements needed for clouds of superhot gas to cool enough to start forming stars, because these elements release more energy, which in turn cools their surroundings. (This was not an issue for the first stars because the primordial hydrogen had a lower temperature when the first stars formed.) The study team believes that stars like J0715-7334 are still able to form thanks to cosmic dust — tiny fragments of dead stars and planets, which may provide additional cooling to the gas.",https://www.livescience.com/space/astronomy/most-pristine-star-ever-seen-discovered-at-the-milky-ways-edge-and-could-be-a-direct-descendant-of-the-universes-first-stars,Science,livescience.com,,https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/e8LorGYUnKcMzbXADjuzqc-1600-80.jpg,2025-10-16T14:31:05+00:00,1a58479591e8f9d8339f97cf921cef5fb9d316c0
3c0ea8971dcc,Chasing comets: How to photograph comets Lemmon and 3I/ATLAS,,"If you’ve been looking for an excuse to dust off your camera, two upcoming comets provide the perfect opportunity. First, comet Lemmon will be at its most visible between October 13-23 and could be as bright as Magnitude 4, meaning there’s a chance it could be visible with the naked eye. October 21 will be the ideal night to see it, thanks to the new moon, and you might even catch the Orionids meteor shower, too. Then, the first half of November and will be the ideal time to take long exposures of comet 3I/ATLAS — although at a predicted Magnitude 10, you’ll still need a camera, binoculars or telescope to be able to see it. Photographing a comet isn’t so different from shooting the moon or a meteor shower , but it’s far more thrilling, since comets are often once-in-a-lifetime sights — comet Lemmon won’t be around again for another 1,150 years! We’ll be going through what gear you’ll need to capture the comets and recommending our favorite models for all budgets, plus what settings to use and composition tips to get the best shots possible. What you'll need A camera, lens and tripod are the bare necessities for photographing a comet. (Image credit: Getty) Which camera should I buy? Technically, any camera can do the job if you know what settings to use. That said, some are better suited to astrophotography than others. Some high-end cameras — like our favorite astrophotography camera, the Nikon Z8 — have a dedicated astrophotography mode designed for low-light shooting, with other models like the Sony A7 IV boosting the brightness of the monitor to help with composing your shot in the dark. We also love the OM System OM-1 Mark II for comets and meteor showers specifically, where Live Composite really comes into its own for long exposures. The two most important factors you need to have in a camera are good noise handling (which, annoyingly, is something you can only really find out from actually using it), and enough controls on the body to adjust the aperture, shutter speed and ISO independently to avoid having to dive into the menus. This is a small but useful thing to have, as it makes manual shooting ten times easier when you’re out in the field and need to make adjustments. Most full-frame models have enough physical controls to make manual shooting much easier when you’re out in the field, but it’s something to be aware of if you’re buying a beginner astrophotography camer a. Most newer cameras have in-built intervalometers to shoot multiple exposures without having to press the shutter continuously, but if you’re using an older camera or a DSLR, a separate intervalometer or shutter release remote is also a handy accessory to have. Some of our favorite astro cameras Which lens is best for photographing comets? A lens with a wide aperture is best for astrophotography. (Image credit: Getty Images) The best astrophotography lenses are those that let in plenty of light, and two features that make this possible are a wide focal length (around 20mm and wider is ideal) and a wide (or fast) aperture of around f/2.8 or faster. Most astro lenses are prime lenses, but wide-angle zooms will also work (provided they have a wide aperture) and open up more composition possibilities with the ability to zoom in and out. Plus, because of the 500 rule — which determines how long you can expose before stars start to trail — a wider focal length lets you use longer shutter speeds. Get the world’s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox. Some of our favorite astro lenses Tripod As astrophotography requires long exposures, it’s not possible to do this handheld, so a sturdy tripod is required. You don’t need to spend a fortune, but if you can afford to invest in a good quality tripod, it’ll last you longer and be constructed from sturdier and more rugged materials. We loved the Benro Mach3 when we reviewed it . Photography accessories that make comet photography easier There are plenty of useful accessories that make photographing comets easier, which can also be utilized for other styles of photography. A good headlamp with a red light will preserve your night vision and help navigate remote trails, and a power bank ensures your electronics don't run out of juice. Some of our favorite tripods How to find the comet You can use astronomy apps to locate specific objects. (Image credit: Stellarium) Each comet appears in a different part of the sky depending on your location, its trajectory and how far it has traveled, so astronomy apps are incredibly useful for locating your subject. There are plenty available, and you can search for your subject and the app will show you when and where to look. Stellarium is a favorite of ours, but Sky Safari and Star Walk are also excellent choices. It’s also a good idea to check light pollution maps to find a dark spot away from city lights. Camera settings Photographing a comet uses similar setting to other types of astrophotography. (Image credit: Javier Zayas Photography via Getty Images) Shooting a comet is very similar to most other types of astrophotography, which is great news if you already know what you’re doing. Shoot in manual mode so you can adjust all your settings yourself, and you’ll need to set your lens to manual focus. Set your aperture to as wide as it can go in order to let the most light in, and divide 500 by your lens’ focal length to determine the best shutter speed to prevent unwanted star trails. Your ISO should be somewhere between 800 and 3,200, depending on the brightness of the comet and the amount of light pollution or ambient light. Start around ISO 800 and increase gradually — it’s better to take a few test shots than risk too much noise. Finally, you want to make sure you’re shooting in RAW so you can process the images afterward to bring the most out of them without destroying the original file. Composition tips Framing the comet and providing foreground elements give a sense of scale and context. (Image credit: John White Photos via Getty Images) To give your comet photos a sense of place and scale, include a foreground element. This can be anything — a mountain, a tree, bridge or a landmark works beautifully. Try to capture the coma (head) of the comet as well as the tail, and you can also experiment with time-lapse photography or shooting multiple calibration frames to stack them together afterward. Watching without a camera Binoculars are a great way to observe a comet that can't be seen with the naked eye. (Image credit: Kimberley Lane) Are binoculars good enough to view a comet? Binoculars aren’t a must-have for astrophotography, but they’re incredibly handy for spotting a comet that’s too faint to see with the naked eye. With a pair of the best stargazing binoculars , you can spot the comet and compose your shot around it, rather than having to rely on trial and error. Plus, you can spend time enjoying the view for the 20-or-so seconds your camera is taking the photo. If you want to use binoculars handheld, go for 8x42, 10x42 or 10x50. If you have a second tripod, you can power up to a 12x,15x or even 20x magnification. Or, if you really want to invest, image stabilization is surprisingly effective for stargazing, but the best image-stabilized binoculars don’t come cheap. Some of our favorite binoculars What sort of telescope do I need to view comets? If you’d like an even closer look, a telescope is a fantastic tool. A small telescope with an alt-azimuth mount will be the easiest option for beginners, while a telescope with a bigger aperture and EQ mount will suit more experienced users. If you’re more confident with telescopes, you could even mount your camera to it using an adapter to take even better astrophotos. Some of our favorite telescopes Telescopes are a fantastic tool for viewing comets. (Image credit: MARK GARLICK/SCIENCE PHOTO LIBRARY via Getty Images) Comets don’t come around often, but when they do, they offer a rare chance to capture something truly spectacular. With the right preparation and a bit of patience, you’ll be ready to make the most of the next one that streaks across our skies.

Rodman came off in the 41st minute of the Spirit's 4-0 win over Monterrey in the Concacaf W Champions Cup, going to ground after attempting a tackle. She was eventually helped up by team staff but was unable to place any weight on her right leg as she came off the field. She was then seen heading into the locker room at halftime on crutches, and later in a full-length knee brace post-match while still on crutches. The player's exact diagnosis is unclear at this time. ""We need to wait until tomorrow,"" Spirit coach Adrian Gonzalez said after the game, according to Pro Soccer Wire . ""She's going to get scanned tomorrow, and we will have more information."" The injury came on the same day that Rodman received her first USWNT call-up since April , spending much of the spring and summer treating a chronic back injury. She has, though, played a sizable role for the Spirit since returning from that injury and has seven goals and two assists across all competitions. The USWNT have three friendlies at the end of the month – two against Portugal on Oct. 23 and Oct. 26 – and another against New Zealand on Oct. 29.

531fbd7c35ad,What's wrong with Wisconsin? Luke Fickell's downturn in Madison starts and ends with problems at quarterback,"luke fickell, luke fickell coaching hot seat, wisconsin football, wisconsin quarterbacks, wisconsin qbs","As Wisconsin prepares for a showdown with No. 1 Ohio State on Saturday (3:30 p.m. ET, CBS, CBSSports.com , CBS Sports App , Paramount+ Premium ), an obvious reality looms over the program: Luke Fickell is battling for his job. The Badgers have lost four straight games, including a 37-0 drubbing to Iowa that Fickell described last Saturday as ""that's low as it can be."" Wisconsin athletics director Chris McIntosh gave Fickell his support on Sept. 20 after a loss to Maryland . But industry sources have continued to note that Fickell's seat is as hot as anyone's in the country. A reality that's especially notable with the Badgers preparing to face Ohio State and Oregon in back-to-back weeks ahead of a bye. This leads one to wonder: What happened? How did a program that used to be a bastion of consistency -- 22 straight winning seasons from 2002 to 2023 -- and a coach who took Cincinnati to the playoff just three years ago fail together? The Buyout Bubble: Why college football keeps paying millions to make coaches disappear Brandon Marcello There's never one answer. But there is an obvious place to start -- quarterback. It's been a disaster. Due to a run of horrendous injury luck and questionable takes, the Badgers have never ranked better than 108th in passer rating and only once had a QB finish among the top 60 in ESPN's QBR metric. That bad quarterback play -- a huge problem given the Badgers' 2023 offensive shift to the Air Raid under former OC Phil Longo -- has doomed Fickell, who is 1-15 in games against Power Four competition when the opponent scores more than 20 points. Wisconsin's QB takes under Fickell Modern college football provides a pair of avenues to address the quarterback spot– transfers and high school development. Let's look at Wisconsin's takes in those areas over the last three years. Transfer and high school recruit ratings are courtesy 247Sports. Transfers High school recruits Big misses out of high school Let's get the high school takes out of the way first. They've been horrendous. The jury is still out on Smith, who is considered more of a gamer than an elite thrower of the football. But LaCrue -- an inherited take from the old staff -- and Mettauer just didn't work. LaCrue is now at Eastern Illinois while Mettauer is now the backup quarterback at Sam Houston , where Longo is the head coach. Longo never came close to landing an elite passer in his two full seasons as a recruiter at Wisconsin. Those misses along with several cycles of them by Paul Chryst's staff -- now Albany QB Myles Burkett in 2022, current Utah Tech QB Deacon Hill in 2021 and no QB in 2020 -- forced Fickell to turn to the transfer portal in search of fixes every offseason. Tyler Van Dyke, who transferred from Miami, was supposed to be a solution for Wisconsin but a torn ACL ended his 2024 season prematurely. Getty Images Bad luck with transfer QBs To the Badgers' credit, their quarterback takes out of the portal have been good, at least on paper. Mordecai threw for 7,000-plus yards at SMU the two seasons prior to him arriving in Madison. He was an ideal fit for the system that Longo wanted to run, and he did have success. Mordecai completed 65% of his passes with the Badgers, led the team to a 6-3 record in games he played start to finish while averaging 27.8 points per game. Unfortunately, Mordecai missed three and a half games with an injury and Wisconsin went 1-3 in those contests while averaging 13.8 points. And that was a GOOD injury luck season for Wisconsin in terms of its portal takes. Wisconsin didn't go for a top-of-the-market QB during the 2024 offseason. Instead, getting Van Dyke on a bit of a discount coming off a down season with Miami. The Badgers started 2-0 with Van Dyke as the starter and there was optimism in the program he'd regain his 2022 form. Then Van Dyke suffered a torn ACL in Week 3 against Alabama . Wisconsin finished 3-7 the rest of the way, averaging just 21.6 points per game with Van Dyke out of the lineup. When Wisconsin reworked its quarterback room in the wake of the Fickell hiring, it considered Locke and Evers basically high school takes. Both were underclassmen and both were former high-profile recruits who fit, at least on paper, what Longo wanted to do offensively. But neither really worked out. Locke, who is now at Arizona , played a lot in 2023 and 2024 as the starter in the absence of Mordecai and Van Dyke. But he largely struggled with a 53.6 completion rate. As for Evers, he never threw a pass for the Badgers, spending one season in Madison before transferring to UConn . Then, for a second time in three offseasons, the Badgers overhauled their QB room. Wisconsin fired Longo and hired Kansas offensive coordinator Jeff Grimes, who brought a wide zone scheme to Madison that was more rooted in the program's history of winning with the run game and along the lines of scrimmage. This time, Wisconsin spent big to lure Edwards away from Maryland. Edwards, who received well into the million-dollar range, per sources, was supposed to be a bridge to the future. A solid, one-year option who could help steady the offense and provide a semblance of consistency. Instead, Edwards suffered a knee sprain in Wisconsin's opener against Miami (Ohio). He then suffered a setback to the same knee trying to come back on Sept. 20 against Maryland. He hasn't played since. Three years, three high-profile transfers and two brutal injuries. Wisconsin brought in O'Neil, a starter as a true freshman at San Diego State in 2024, with the intention that he could redshirt. Instead, he got thrown into action immediately. O'Neil had some flashes and is competing 70.6% of his passes. But he's thrown at least one interception in every game and got benched for Simmons, a FCS transfer who was brought in to be experienced depth. Simmons isn't fairing any better. He's completing 55.9% of his passes and has thrown for 329 yards in three games. It may be too late to fix Wisconsin's handling of quarterbacks is mostly bad luck, but there's a fair number of self-inflicted wounds given some of the takes for the program out of high school. The Badgers do have an intriguing high-upside 2026 quarterback take in the boat in Mater Dei (California) starter Ryan Hopkins, who is an incredible athlete with a sub-11-second time in the 100-meter dash. But the reality is, Fickell and his staff might not get a fourth offseason to fix their quarterback quandary. Moving to the Air Raid was a mistake in retrospect. The lack of high-level quarterback play didn't help, but neither did the Badgers' lack of legitimate playmakers on the outside. Those are just not players easily found in Wisconsin's high school recruiting footprint. Worse still, shifting to the Air Raid for two seasons seems to have sapped the program's usual identity of dominance in the trenches. The current Badgers' O-line ranks 91st in PFF's pass blocking metric and 119th in run blocking among FBS programs. A good quarterback might help make up for some of those shortcomings up front, and it's not as if Grimes' system requires elite offensive linemen to thrive. But a mid-stream swerve of philosophy leaves very little margin for error as Fickell attempts to prevent his program from taking on additional water. And a tidal wave in the form of Ohio State and Oregon are coming soon.",https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/news/wisconsin-football-luke-fickell-quarterbacks-recruiting-transfer-portal,Sport,cbssports.com,,https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2025/10/15/4abafa68-e018-4227-b94b-7060d2961ba9/thumbnail/1200x675/80db967df7057bdfa9cf748c38249c42/luke-fickell-wisconsin.jpg,2025-10-16T14:30:35+00:00,a9cac4b0142d44011689e9f75697eb5cea89e412
25e512a4d8f9,Seven stretch run storylines that will define the second half of the 2025 college football season,"college football storylines, miami national title, sec championship race, big ten championship race, college football playoff","As we enter Week 8 and the second half of the 2025 college football season, there's a rare sense of uncertainty — and a bit of joy in that uneasiness. It fuels anticipation for what's next. Which top-10 team will fall? Which under-the-radar matchup will turn into an instant classic? And what surprise twist might emerge in an increasingly chaotic coaching carousel? On the field, the sport has never felt more balanced. Call it the great flattening -- the best teams aren't quite as dominant, while the second tier has closed the gap. ESPN's Bill Connelly illustrated that trend through his SP+ ratings, a predictive and forward-facing metric. Comparing Week 8 SP+ data from 2019 to 2025, he found that the top eight teams this season are rated lower, on average and at every ranking position, than their 2019 counterparts. But from Nos. 9 through 25, the reverse is true — those teams are rated higher across the board in 2025. The proliferation of the transfer portal and NIL -- not just as tools available to some but as foundational pieces of program-building across the country -- has created a new era in roster construction. It's also stripped the top programs of their ability to hoard talent that could be contributing elsewhere. The lure of more playing time and compensation is allowing teams from No. 9 through No. 25 to get a little better, while the elite programs lose the depth edge they enjoyed for much of college football's modern era. Thankfully, this new competitive reality has arrived alongside an expanded postseason structure that's no longer limited to just two or four teams. Logically, if those top-five teams are closer than ever to the rest of the pack, then widening the lens to define a worthy College Football Playoff contender makes sense. But picking contenders is more difficult because the great flattening of college football has made previously stunning results more common. Losses by heavy favorites and top-10 teams are becoming routine because those top programs no longer carry the hammer of their predecessors -- and accepting that reality means learning to live with the uncertainty that has become the sport's new normal. And while the end point is uncertain, a road map has emerged for the journey ahead. Here are some of the storylines that will define the discussion around college football as we move through the second half of the 2025 season. College Football's Top 150 Players at Midseason of 2025: The definitive list, led by Miami's Rueben Bain Jr. Blake Brockermeyer A collision course for Ohio State and Indiana To call back to our ratings discussion, Ohio State is the only team that seems to be pulling ahead from a crowded pack at the top. The Buckeyes are an overwhelming No. 1 in the polls and the power ratings, and they seem be getting stronger with additional tests. Now that Penn State has crashed out, the number of roadblocks on the regular-season schedule is limited. So Ohio State's biggest enemy, it seems, is itself -- and any Michigan-related nightmares that could be lingering in Ann Arbor at the end of the year. As long as the Buckeyes take care of business, the reigning national champions will be back in the College Football Playoff, with a stop in Indianapolis to play for the Big Ten championship along the way. And what might be waiting for Ohio State in Indianapolis could be epic. Now that Indiana has handed Oregon a head-to-head loss, the Hoosiers find themselves with an inroad to the Big Ten Championship Game for the first time in program history. Curt Cignetti has shaken up the power dynamic locally in basketball-crazed Bloomington as well as nationally, taking Indiana up to No. 3 in the AP Top 25 poll for the first time in school history with a chance for back-to-back College Football Playoff appearances. Indiana, like Ohio State, has a game against Penn State game remaining that doesn't carry the same weight after James Franklin's firing. If the Hoosiers can handle business, they could meet one of the two teams that defeated them in 2024. Cignetti has reflected on last year's loss to Ohio State in Columbus with notes on what went wrong and what was learned, so there would be some enjoyment in getting another shot at the Buckeyes on a ""neutral"" site at Lucas Oil Stadium. Notre Dame tries to run the table (again) We're putting this storyline near the top because it could be settled by the end of Saturday's games. If Notre Dame holds serve at home and defeats USC for a third straight season, the Fighting Irish will keep alive the hope of winning 10 straight games after an 0-2 start. The fact that we're back here again -- with Notre Dame's postseason outlook hanging on a razor's edge each weekend -- seems exhausting from the outside. But inside Marcus Freeman's program, there's a calm, mature, step-by-step approach to the challenge. The urgency the Fighting Irish carried after an early season upset loss to Northern Illinois arguably contributed to some of the most impressive football we saw from anyone over the back half of the season. When teams had to level up for the College Football Playoff, it was no problem for Notre Dame. In terms of CFP contention, the situation is clearly different than it was a year ago. The Fighting Irish have more losses but also defeats to quality opponents, with Miami and Texas A&M off to a combined 11-0 start. Last year's CFP bracket included five teams at-large selections with two losses, but three of those participants suffered their second loss in a conference championship game. The other two, Ohio State and Tennessee, each had wins against a top-12 team according to the committee's final rankings. Currently, Notre Dame has no wins against top-25 teams, and its only remaining ranked opponent is USC at No. 20 in Week 8. So the Irish are not only playing with fire in terms of avoiding a third loss, but also need the teams they defeat to rise to the status of a ""good win"" in the eyes of the selection committee that will pick the seven at-large teams for the bracket. Considering all the possibilities is enough to make anyone's head hurt, which is why inside the program in South Bend the focus remains on improving and taking care of each opponent in dominant fashion. Outside South Bend, the debates will rage as long as the Fighting Irish keep winning. Who emerges from a muddled SEC picture? Last season, the SEC title race got so complicated that we had to build models to constantly calculate tiebreaker scenarios, and the threat of a coin toss may have been on the line. A 16-team league where half the conference is a realistic College Football Playoff contender at midseason creates loads of tension for the final weeks of the schedule. There's an easy path to the CFP -- winning the league -- and a much more difficult one: enduring and winning strength-of-schedule debates against competition from other conferences. Consider the Fable of 2024: Where Alabama had an inroad to the SEC Championship Game before losing at Oklahoma as a two-touchdown favorite on Nov. 23. Flip that result, and the Crimson Tide are playing in the SEC Championship Game and in the College Football Playoff, where the team still finished as the first at-large team left out, even with the late upset loss. So while the SEC vs. Big Ten battle for at-large spots is certainly coming, the more urgent storyline is figuring out which teams will make it to Atlanta with a chance to secure the easiest path to the CFP. Alabama, once again, finds itself as a main character, playing the role of pace car. The Crimson Tide have no SEC losses yet and are heavy favorites to make the title game this year. But they still have to play Tennessee, LSU and Oklahoma -- a trio of teams among the seven that enter Week 8 nationally ranked and with just one loss in league play. Alabama is joined at the top by Ole Miss and Texas A&M, each with 3-0 records, and those three teams have no crossover on the league schedule. It's possible, in theory, that all three go 8-0 in conference play, and we are right back to calculating the cumulative winning percentage of conference opponents. But don't break out the calculators just yet -- there's half a season left to play, and a Week 8 schedule alone could disrupt the entire outlook. As we head into the second half of the season, there are 10 teams with a fair argument as real SEC title contenders. They can't all make the CFP, so which two can give themselves the best chance by making it to Atlanta? Miami vs. November After more than two decades waiting for a true return to title contention, ""The U"" is back. Mario Cristobal has already achieved base-level success in breaking the hype cycle and delivering real results, carrying a 15-3 record since the start of last season. But while last year brought some program-level notoriety -- just the second 10-win season since 2004 -- it ended without appearances in the ACC Championship Game or the College Football Playoff. Those opportunities were dashed in November, when Miami went 2-2 against ACC opponents, including one-score road losses to Georgia Tech and Syracuse, the latter after giving up a 21-point lead in the regular-season finale. The loss to the Orange bounced Miami from the ACC Championship Game, and when the College Football Playoff selection committee issued its final ruling for 2024, the Hurricanes checked in at No. 13, the second team (behind Alabama) left out of an at-large spot. These were winnable opportunities for a team that entered November with an 8-0 record. Unfortunately, this is a theme not unfamiliar to Miami fans. While anecdotes recall November road games in cold environments that don't suit the Hurricanes, Cristobal's early tenure shows struggles finishing the season. Since taking over before the 2022 season, Cristobal is 4-8 in November. Adding to the concern, both the 2023 and 2024 seasons also included bowl losses. In total, Miami is 4-10 after Halloween under Cristobal, and the No. 2-ranked Hurricanes are likely to confront those demons again, with ACC title and College Football Playoff implications all through the month. For the record, this Miami team has the best offensive line-defensive line combination in the country and appears on a path to fulfilling expectations for a team entering Week 8 ranked No. 2. Carson Beck is a top contender for the Heisman Trophy (more on that later), and offseason defensive changes have produced a much more reliable -- even dominant -- unit. Miami looks as good as it has since the glory days fans are eager to reclaim, but the path to being comfortable as one of the sport's alphas requires putting the belt of title contention on the line week after week and successfully defending it as the season enters its most pressure-packed month. The cascading dominos of the coaching carousel If you include Stanford, six power conference programs are already searching for a new coach for 2026 and the firing of James Franklin may have accelerated the timeline for notable schools to make moves. The latest look at the hot seat has CBS Sports' Richard Johnson and Chris Hummer listing Florida, Wisconsin and Auburn among the other power conference jobs where things are heating up heading into the weekend. Penn State being open could spark just as much movement as Franklin being available, since the Nittany Lions could very likely target a sitting head coach who in turn would leave vacant a desirable position for another sitting head coach. So you see it happening, right? A world where Penn State, Florida, Auburn, Arkansas and Wisconsin are open is one that will lead to a lot of other openings at current FBS schools, sparking a chain reaction of change that could represent a seismic shift in the coaching landscape. It's not hyperbole -- we've seen it before, most recently at the end of the 2021 season, when it wasn't just the number of power-conference jobs changing hands (14) but the magnitude of the players involved. Florida, LSU, Miami, Notre Dame, Oklahoma, Oregon and USC have either won or played in a national championship game in the 21st century. All of them changed head coaches in that 2021-22 cycle. Lincoln Riley left Oklahoma for USC, Brian Kelly left Notre Dame for LSU, and the hires of both Mario Cristobal from Oregon to Miami and Dan Lanning to Oregon have proven transformative for both programs. We are in for that kind of cycle again, where the caliber of jobs open is already strong, but the domino hires could end up being just as impactful. Fascinating Group of Six races add intrigue to the CFP picture One of the obvious improvements to the College Football Playoff format was allowing access to the Group of Six. While far less inclusive than its FCS counterpart, the CFP hypothetically reserves one spot for a league champion outside the power conferences. The update was announced, and college football fans braced for a home stretch of concurrent CFP-related races across the country. But then Boise State ruined the fun with one of the program's many dominant runs through the regular season. The Broncos were ranked in the top 15 by Nov. 1, and the debate was not whether they would get the fifth conference champion spot, but how they stacked up against the champions from the Big 12 and ACC. As it turned out, Boise State finished ranked ahead of both Arizona State and Clemson and well ahead of Army, the next-highest ranked Group of Six conference champion. There is not an obvious favorite this season so far. The closest example might be South Florida, which logged wins against Florida and Boise State (interestingly enough) in nonconference play and just threw down the gauntlet in the American with a 63-36 win against fellow contender North Texas. The Bulls are currently No. 19 in the AP Top 25 poll and have another massive head-to-head coming with No. 22 Memphis in two weeks. But what if the winner of that game stumbles again, or unranked Tulane creeps into the picture? The American almost has too many contenders to allow a Boise State–like sun run from the Group of Six to the CFP, which opens the conversation to the Mountain West, Sun Belt, MAC and Conference USA. Boise State and James Madison have a chance to build their argument over the next couple of weeks, but the wide-open nature of all these conference races reflects the great flattening we see at the top of the sport. Is there room for a dark horse in the Heisman Trophy race? If we're going to use the oddsmakers as our guide, the results of the last two weeks have really winnowed the field for the top Heisman Trophy contenders. As teams tumble in the rankings, so do the Heisman chances for their star players, and the concurrent rise of players like Indiana quarterback Fernando Mendoza has stripped some of the odds equity from what was a wide-open field. Currently, FanDuel Sportsbook has three quarterbacks with far and away better odds than the rest of the field. Miami's Carson Beck (+300), Alabama's Ty Simpson (+320) and Indiana's Fernando Mendoza (+430) have a combined implied probability of 67.7%. But what about the other 32.3%? Odds, as always, are subject to change, and market conditions can — and will — dictate wild swings in these probabilities. As a thought exercise, it's worth considering how many worthy players have the potential to rise from that 32.3% and challenge the likes of Carson Beck, who, for the record, has odds of +300, translating to a 25% implied probability. Maybe it's USC's Jayden Maiava or Notre Dame's CJ Carr, each with a big stage Saturday to showcase what has been some of the most impressive quarterback play to date. Or maybe it's Utah's Devon Dampier, who could shake off his early-season defeat to Texas Tech with a stat-stuffed run that sets up a rematch against the Red Raiders two days before the Heisman ballots are due. The odds suggest there's a good chance one of the top three wins, but the rest of college football is filled with stars ready to be the underdog story from the 32.3%.",https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/news/seven-stretch-run-storylines-that-will-define-the-second-half-of-the-2025-college-football-season,Sport,cbssports.com,,https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2025/10/16/660111cd-3d68-476e-9fdc-f33c013a2547/thumbnail/1200x675/3000ec590eb35e0ca1f947d7ffcecd1a/ohio-statestoryline-1.jpg,2025-10-16T14:22:08+00:00,bd660f05ca768c38bf861782b05273e78882341c
77ef27afb81c,From Pittsburgh problem to Cowboys star: How once-troubled WR George Pickens is thriving in Dallas,"george pickens, dallas cowboys, jerry jones, george pickens contract extension, george pickens stats, george pickens trade, micah parsons trade","FRISCO, Texas -- When the Dallas Cowboys traded for explosive wide receiver George Pickens from the Pittsburgh Steelers in May, his stock was at an all-time low. Steelers head coach Mike Tomlin told him to ""grow up"" after he was flagged for two personal-foul penalties in the middle of the 2024 season. Pittsburgh signed four-time NFL MVP quarterback Aaron Rodgers and traded for Pro Bowl wide receiver DK Metcalf to bolster its offense, but it would've made sense to pair Pickens with those two high-end talents. Instead, the Steelers decided to ditch the 24-year-old receiver -- the only player in the NFL with at least 150 catches (206) who averages at least 16 yards per reception (16.3) since he was drafted in the second round of the 2022 NFL Draft . The price for Dallas to acquire Pickens was just a 2026 third-round pick and a 2027 fifth-rounder in exchange for the electrifying receiver and a 2027 sixth-round pick. Pickens rebuilding his image in Dallas Fast forward to Week 7 this season, and the Cowboys are overjoyed with Pickens both on and off the field. On the field, his production is among the best in the league: Pickens' six receiving touchdowns are tied with Detroit Lions All-Pro receiver Amon-Ra St. Brown for the most in the NFL, and his 525 receiving yards rank third. That's one reason team owner and general manager Jerry Jones is weighing the idea of carving out salary-cap space to extend Pickens , an impending free agent, next offseason. ""He is doing more than we could have expected,"" Jones said. ""We knew full well that if things really went like we wanted them to go, certainly, we need to think about having some room available if we're going to pay a second receiver at that level."" Pro Bowl wide receiver Amari Cooper is usually top of mind when people think about Dallas acquiring a receiver who made an instant impact. Cooper's addition in the middle of the 2018 season powered Dallas to a 7-2 finish, ending the regular season 10-6 and atop the NFC East. Pickens' statistical output mirrors Cooper's early on. Pickens is tied for the most receiving touchdowns (six) in a player's first six games with the Cowboys since the 1970 AFL/NFL merger, according to CBS Sports Research. Would Pickens be open to re-signing with the Cowboys on a long-term deal, similar to Cooper's five-year, $100 million extension in 2020? He's open to it. ""I wouldn't mind it. The guys in the locker room are super cool, the energy is great,"" Pickens said Wednesday. ""I always want to showcase my talents."" However, he said his long-term future isn't top of mind six weeks into the season. He's focused on getting the Cowboys back into the playoff mix after a 2-3-1 start in which Dallas has the No. 1 total offense (387.5 yards per game) and the worst total defense (411.7). Winning comes before money for Pickens Quarterback play, winning and money are typically the three biggest factors for a wide receiver when weighing a long-term deal in the NFL. Pickens made it clear which one he values most: winning. His Hoover High School team in Alabama won back-to-back Class 7A state championships in 2016 and 2017, and he helped Georgia capture its first national title since the 1980s during the 2021 college football season, his last as a Bulldog. Another thing to keep in mind about Pickens' potential extension with the Cowboys is his representation and relationship with Jones. He's represented by Athletes First, the same agency that represented former Dallas All-Pro edge rusher Micah Parsons . However, Jones said during a Cowboys press conference on Aug. 28 -- after trading Parsons to the Green Bay Packers -- that he didn't think those negotiations would affect talks with any other Athletes First client. ""He's definitely a cool guy for me,"" Pickens said. ""It's a guy I've always watched on TV and stuff like that, but I [would] definitely say he's a bigger person than everybody else around here. I feel like he has his own life going on as well, too. That's kind of the part I want to know about Jerry -- him outside of football."" He also feels somewhat of a connection with Jones, given both have been viewed as polarizing figures in football over the past few years. The two talked when Pickens first arrived in Dallas in May, but there hasn't been much contact since, with the wide receiver focused squarely on football. ""I feel like the media can ... definitely tarnish some people or give the wrong image to people,"" Pickens said. ""I feel like if you sit down and have a conversation with him, lighthearted guy."" 'What a great teammate' Pickens was aware of his Steelers reputation as an immature diva. He feels like he's able to show a more authentic, fun-loving side in Dallas -- something Jones, head coach Brian Schottenheimer and teammates agree on. ""It wasn't really hard to ignore because I knew who I was. I'm the person everybody is seeing now,"" Pickens said. ""It's just a thing that you kind of have to go through. I always kind of knew that the people didn't know me. I never really cared. ... I think there's better opportunities for me to show myself here."" Jones went out of his way to compliment Pickens on how seamlessly he's fit into the Cowboys' coaching staff and locker room. ""What's really special is he's a real plus to have around the team. He's a real plus around his teammates. He's a great plus around those coaches,"" Jones said. ""Those coaches really think highly of him, and so he's not only doing it on the field. He's doing it as a part of the team concept. That's very important, and in his particular case, should be noted."" Inside Pickens' personality and energy boost Recently, Pickens -- whose nine contested catches in 2025 are tied for the most in the NFL with Cincinnati Bengals All-Pro Ja'Marr Chase , per Pro Football Focus -- climbed the ladder to make a one-handed catch in practice. That led to a lighthearted exchange between him and Schottenheimer. ""Literally you guys can see how much he loves playing the game of football. It's very evident. It doesn't matter the situation: he just loves playing the game. His personality is truly infectious. We actually sit in meetings a lot and we just laugh about GP and some of the stuff he says on the field. ""Number one: any pass he catches, he practices a celebration, so that's kind of cool. He's got a lot of choreographed stuff. Some of the stuff he'll do; like he caught a ball the other day -- it was a one-handed catch and the safety was running over the top. I was asking him about it and said, 'Hey, man, that was an amazing catch.' He goes, 'Yeah, insane, right?' But he just loves it. What a great teammate, man. Seriously. Great teammate, and we're so lucky to have him."" Pickens laughed when recalling that interaction before revealing his thought process on the celebrations. ""I'm super funny. I feel like when you really get to know me, I feel like Schotty really knows me, so that's one thing he definitely can say about me because I'm a goofy guy that likes to make people laugh for sure,"" Pickens said ""Just certain jokes and certain little puns for guys. We're always playing football, so I kind of lighten it up. ... I'm an energy guy, so I caught a few go balls today, and I think like 'if I catch that in a game, then I'm going to do this. Or if I catch a slant and get a first down, I'm going to do this.' I definitely think about it."" Another thing Pickens is always thinking about: his handshakes. He has one with about 40 of his new Cowboys teammates. ""Since I was new to the team, that's kind of something that I wanted to bring to the team, lots of handshakes for the guys. I had a few in Pittsburgh but not as many as I do now."" Running back Javonte Williams is one of the many who enjoy a custom handshake with the NFL's co-leader in receiving touchdowns. ""He's a character. He's good. He brings a lot of energy and excitement to the team,"" Williams said Wednesday. ""He's got a different personality, but I get along with him. I feel like everybody else gets along with him, so you got to keep doing what you're doing."" Pickens went viral on social media for his hurdles and stiff arms in his explosion against the Carolina Panthers in Week 6 -- a game in which he recorded nine catches for a career-high 168 yards (the second-most in his career) and a touchdown. That's something he showcases in practice ""every day"" with Dallas. ""We just see it every day. That's how he always acts,"" Williams said. ""So just for the world to see the type of person he really is because it's easy for people to get you confused and narratives to be made about you. But he's a good guy. I really want the world to see that.""",https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/george-pickens-cowboys-contract-thriving-redemption,Sport,cbssports.com,,https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2025/10/16/9345059a-993a-4ee2-882c-3036694b5b63/thumbnail/1200x675/667a5eacb02399b97d38e485636717ea/pickens.jpg,2025-10-16T14:19:14+00:00,41ed5b621516125fe931f5e1555bacd41aa3d1e5

The Dukes, who are the first team in Sun Belt history to get off to 5-1 starts in four consecutive seasons and have yet to allow an opponent to register 300 total yards in 2025, have had the upper hand against the Monarchs of late. After losing the first two games in the all-time series, James Madison has won all three meetings since joining the FBS in 2022. SportsLine's Inside the Lines team's projection model sees the winning streak continuing as the Dukes defeat the Monarchs in 68% of its simulations . Hawaii vs. Colorado State Hawaii (5-2, 2-1) seeks its third consecutive victory when it visits Colorado State (2-4, 1-1) in a Mountain West matchup. The Rainbow Warriors have gotten off to their best start through seven games since beginning 2018 with a 6-1 record and have turned it up offensively of late. Hawaii scored 44 points in back-to-back games to defeat Air Force and Utah State , with QB Micah Alejado throwing for more than 400 yards and three touchdowns in each contest and wideout Jackson Harris eclipsing 100 receiving yards on seven catches in both wins. Colorado State halted its three-game losing streak with a 49-21 triumph over Fresno State last week. Jackson Brousseau had only 144 passing yards in the victory but threw three TD passes, including a pair to tight end Rocky Beers . The Rams, who also ran for three scores against the Bulldogs, have found the end zone on 76.5% of their trips to the red zone this season after doing so just 54.5% of the time in 2024. The Rams are 16-12 in the all-time series, including a 10-3 mark at home. But the Rainbow Warriors have won three of the last four meetings after losing seven straight, with both of the last two victories being one-score decisions. The ITL team's model doesn't believe Hawaii will prevail on Saturday as its simulations have Colorado State winning 71% of the time . Missouri vs. Auburn No. 16 Missouri (5-1, 1-1) looks to extend its winning streak against unranked opponents to 22 games when it visits Auburn (3-3, 0-3) in a showdown between SEC teams. Missouri, which is playing its first contest on the road this season, is hoping to bounce back from a 27-24 loss to Alabama that caused it to drop two spots in the rankings. Ahmad Hardy was limited to 52 yards on 12 carries in the defeat, ending his streak of seven consecutive 100-yard performances, but is second in the nation this season with an average of 130.3 rushing yards per game and nine touchdown runs. Auburn will be attempting to stop a losing streak that reached three games with last week's 20-10 setback against then-No. 10 Georgia. Each defeat during the slide came at the hands of a top 15 opponent, dropping Auburn to 1-18 in its last 19 meetings with ranked schools. Quarterback Jackson Arnold has made 319 consecutive pass attempts without an interception, which is the longest active streak in FBS and the third-longest in SEC history. Auburn, which has allowed only 519 yards on the ground this season - its fewest through the first six games of a season since permitting 488 in 1999, owns a 3-2 edge in the all-time series. However, Missouri posted a 21-17 victory last year on Jamal Roberts ' 4-yard touchdown run with 46 seconds remaining in the fourth quarter. The ITL team's model sees Missouri leveling the overall series as head coach Eli Drinkwitz's squad wins in 70% of its simulations . Money line underdog parlay for Week 8 LSU vs. Vanderbilt This SEC clash between No. 10 LSU (5-1, 2-1) and No. 17 Vanderbilt (5-1, 1-1) marks the first with both teams in the top 25 since 1947, when the 18th-ranked Tigers posted a 19-13 victory against the 19th-ranked Commodores. LSU bounced back from its first loss of the season with last week's 20-10 triumph over South Carolina , which was its eighth win in nine games dating back to last year. Quarterback Garrett Nussmeier threw for 254 yards and a pair of touchdowns as he improved to 13-1 as a starter against unranked opponents. The Commodores got off to just their second 5-0 start in 80 years before suffering a 30-14 loss at then-No. 10 Alabama last time out. Diego Pavia was held under 200 passing yards for the third time in 2025 after throwing for a season-high 321 against Utah State in his previous contest. Vanderbilt's signal-caller is just 2-5 against ranked teams in his career but is 13th in the nation this year with a 71.4% completion rate. LSU won last year's meeting 24-17 to extend its winning streak against Vanderbilt to 10 games and improve to 25-7-1 in the all-time series. The ITL team's model believes the Tigers will make it 11 in a row as its simulations have them winning 66% of the time . Southern Miss vs. Louisiana Southern Miss (4-2, 2-0) aims to remain perfect in Sun Belt action when it visits Louisiana (2-4, 1-1). The Golden Eagles withstood a late comeback attempt and edged Georgia Southern 38-35 last week to improve to 2-0 in conference play this season. Braylon Braxton threw for a pair of touchdowns, marking the sixth time in as many contests this year he has made multiple scoring passes, while Jeffery Pittman gained 140 yards on the ground and recorded his third consecutive game with two rushing TDs. The Ragin' Cajuns are coming off their third loss in four contests, a 24-14 setback at James Madison. Sophomore quarterback Lunch Winfield made his first career start and had a pair of touchdown passes after coming off the bench to throw for two scores and run for three others in a 54-51 double-overtime triumph over Marshall in Louisiana's previous game. Winfield also gained 129 yards on the ground in that win and has been the team's leading rusher in back-to-back contests. Southern Miss, which hasn't started 3-0 in conference play since 2004 while a member of Conference USA, has won 11 of its last 12 meetings with Louisiana and is 42-12-1 in the all-time series. But according to the ITL team's model, the Ragin' Cajuns will get the job done Saturday as they win in 71% of the simulations . Maryland vs. UCLA UCLA (2-4, 2-1) seeks its third consecutive victory when it hosts Maryland (4-2, 1-2) in a Big 12 matchup. The Bruins began the season with four straight losses before upsetting then-No. 7 Penn State 42-37 for Tim Skipper's first win as their interim head coach and trampling Michigan State 38-13. UCLA allowed the Spartans to record the game's first touchdown last week before scoring 38 consecutive points as Nico Iamaleava threw three touchdown passes - including a pair to running back Jalen Berger , who also ran for a score. Maryland's season has been the complete opposite, as it got off to a 4-0 start before suffering one-score home losses to Washington and Nebraska . The Terrapins built a 20-point lead against the Huskies but squandered it en route to a 24-20 defeat and entered the fourth quarter against the Cornhuskers ahead by seven but dropped a 34-31 decision. Despite the setbacks, Maryland is first in the FBS with a plus-10 turnover differential and tied for seventh in the nation with 20 sacks. The teams are meeting for just the third time overall and first since the Terrapins recorded a 7-0 victory in 1955. UCLA edged Maryland 12-7 in their first clash the previous year. The ITL team's model sees the Terrapins gaining the upper hand in the series, as its simulations say they win 64% of the time .",https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/news/college-football-picks-best-money-line-parlays-for-week-8-include-missouri-lsu,Sport,cbssports.com,,https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2025/10/14/ad7b2276-aa88-474c-ac5d-bfdd2a9079ff/thumbnail/1200x675/a170518a476c71df8a5389c858ef7231/garrett-nussmeier-lsu-tigers.jpg,2025-10-16T14:06:41+00:00,718a0c344f7d91e870665254a54a3f4764862ce1
079bd0a6758e,"College Football Playoff race 2025: Georgia vs. Ole Miss, Alabama vs. Tennessee take center stage in Week 8","college football playoff race, week 8 college football games, ncaaf week 8, college football games to watch, sec schedule, big ten schedule, acc schedule, big 12 schedule","Though rivalry weekend is often reserved for the final week of the regular season, we're getting an enticing preview in Week 8 as some of college football's most notable foes are set to face off against one another. It's one reason to be excited about a loaded slate of games. The other reason is the fact that five ranked teams will play against one another on Saturday alone. Considering that three of those ranked matchups are between the aforementioned rivals and this has the makings of a legendary weekend for college football. It's also a huge day for the SEC. No. 11 Tennessee's trip to No. 6 Alabama for the latest installment of the ""Third Saturday in October"" is the highlight. It's also one of three top-25 games between SEC opponents. There's plenty to pay attention to outside of the south, as well. Here's a look at the Week 8 games that matter in the playoff race, and what it means for both teams involved. College Football's Top 150 Players at Midseason of 2025: The definitive list, led by Miami's Rueben Bain Jr. Blake Brockermeyer LSU touts a lofty ranking but the Tigers haven't looked entirely convincing thus far. The defense is a lot better in its second year under coordinator Blake Baker. Surprisingly, the offense has held this team back thus far. Quarterback Garrett Nussmeier has far underperformed when considering the expectations for him entering the year. It's also clear that he's banged up after taking a lot of hits behind a poor offensive line. LSU's already got one loss. Another will completely eliminate its margin for error for the rest of the season, which is bad news when it still has No. 4 Texas A&M and No. 6 Alabama on the schedule. Vanderbilt is no slouch. In fact, this is shaping up to be one of the biggest seasons in university history -- certainly of the past century. The Commodores are favored against LSU for the first time since 1948. This also snaps a 176-game streak as a betting underdog against ranked opponents. That being said, Vanderbilt is still searching for a truly marquee win to boost its record. A top-10 SEC program would do that. It seems like Lane Kiffin is good for one inexplicable loss per year, so Ole Miss fans probably breathed a heavy sigh of relief when the Rebels escaped Week 7 with a 24-21 win against Washington State . It's better to look back at an uninspiring victory than dwell on a defeat. They're going to have to play a lot better as they travel to Athens. The Bulldogs are one of just two currently ranked opponents remaining on Ole Miss' schedule. Being undefeated at this point means that a win isn't entirely necessary, but if Ole Miss is able to come out on top, it would be hard to see the Rebels missing the playoff -- barring some late-season meltdown. The story of Georgia's season, thus far, has been slow starts. The Bulldogs fell behind 21-7 against Tennessee earlier in the year before roaring back for a win. In Week 7, Auburn jumped out to a 10-0 lead, but Georgia was able to rally with 20 unanswered points to avoid a potentially disastrous upset. Georgia can't start slow against an explosive Ole Miss team. The Rebels can put enough points on the board that it may be hard to dig out of a potential hole. No. 11 Tennessee at No. 6 Alabama Tennessee is 2-1 against Alabama in the past three years. That one loss came on the road. The Vols haven't won in Tuscaloosa since 2003. On top of that, Josh Heupel's Tennessee teams tend to struggle in big road environments. Since 2022, the Vols are 5-7 in SEC away games. They also lost 42-17 on the road against Ohio State in the first round of the College Football Playoff last season. At some point, Tennessee has to log a truly signature road win if it wants to take that next step under Heupel. Alabama, on the other hand, currently has a 15-game home win streak, which is tied with Boise State for first among FBS programs. The Crimson Tide are a legitimate juggernaut in their second year under coach Kalen DeBoer. That season-opening loss against Florida State seems like years in the past, as they've dispatched three straight ranked opponents over the last three weeks, including Georgia. Alabama already has such an impressive record that a loss to Tennessee may not even drop it out of the top 10. USC has flown under the radar a bit this year despite this being its second appearance in the AP Top 25 poll. The Trojans made their return with a dominant 31-13 win against Michigan . It was an impressive performance for coach Lincoln Riley's team who, in spite of leaning on a walk-on running back for a majority of the game, outgained Michigan 224 yards to 109 on the ground. The victory also vaulted USC back into fringe playoff status. It obviously still has work to do to become a true contender. Notre Dame has been on cruise control since it started the season 0-2. The caveat is that Notre Dame currently has the No. 28 strength of record, per ESPN's FPI metric , which is well outside of the range of expected playoff teams. As of right now, this is the Irish's last opportunity to get a quality win. They don't have another currently ranked opponent on their schedule and their top remaining opponent may just be a Group of Six program in Navy . No. 23 Utah at No. 15 BYU Utah isn't out of the conversation just yet. The Utes earned a much-needed statement win last week by beating preseason Big 12 favorite Arizona State 42-10. This writer doesn't personally put much stock into ""quality losses"" -- a patently absurd concept -- but Utah's lone setback against No. 7 Texas Tech isn't detrimental by any means. The Red Raiders are simply a buzzsaw. The path is still wide open for Utah to make it to the Big 12 Championship Game and beyond, but beating BYU is a necessity. BYU controls its own destiny. The Cougars remain undefeated and they're one of three Big 12 schools with a 3-0 mark in conference play. They survived a road scare against a solid Arizona team last week. This is their biggest test yet, though. Utah is the first AP-ranked team that BYU has faced all season. The Big 12 is very top-heavy this season. Every win and loss makes a major difference in the scramble for league supremacy. Dark Horse Game of the Week This could also read as trap game of the week for Georgia Tech. It's not going to be easy to go on the road and win at Duke, especially since the Yellow Jackets haven't looked entirely convincing in conference play thus far. Given the ACC's lack of depth this year, any loss in that conference looks bad on a team's resume. Duke had a rough go of it in non-conference play, though a home loss to Illinois and a road loss to one of the Group of Six's best in Tulane aren't the worst blots on a record. The Blue Devils have been great since. They're 3-0 in ACC play with an average margin of victory of 23.7 points. Georgia Tech is, obviously, a step up in the level of competition, but a win here would put Duke in the driver's seat for one of two ACC Championship Game spots. From there, the playoff is possible.",https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/news/college-football-playoff-race-2025-georgia-vs-ole-miss-alabama-vs-tennessee-take-center-stage-in-week-8,Sport,cbssports.com,,https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2025/10/16/58f6dd34-c91c-4510-b467-41ac45b521f0/thumbnail/1200x675/5d4190ced434a94816d1cedbe01fbcf5/alabama-tennessee.jpg,2025-10-16T13:48:32+00:00,cdac21b8c3ac56b61daa0910699c513ddb4e13a2

38e70fb58ce4,What's wrong with NFL powerhouses? Early struggles leading to most wide open title race in 15 years,"chiefs, patrick mahomes, ravens, lamar jackson, eagles, jalen hurts, bills, josh allen, lions, jared goff, nfl, powerhouses, favorites, super bowl, super bowl race","The word parity gets thrown around a lot, especially in the NFL . After all, there have been four new playoff teams in 35 straight seasons. There's parity every year. That's one of the beautiful things about this league. 2025 is taking it to a whole new level, though. It's not hyperbole to say this is the most parity we've seen in quite some time. The debate for the best team in the NFL is actually interesting right now. You could probably make a case that 10-15 teams have legit Super Bowl chances, too. This isn't any other year. The Chiefs and Bills are co-Super Bowl favorites with +650 odds, according to DraftKings , as of Wednesday night. Those are the longest odds by the Super Bowl favorite this late into a season in 15 years, since Week 13 in 2010 when the Falcons and Patriots were co-favorites. If 2025 is anything like 2010, we'll be in for a wild ride this winter. Let's review what happened in the 2010 postseason: The 7-9 Seahawks beat the Saints on Marshawn Lynch's ""Beastquake"" The Jets knocked out Tom Brady and Peyton Manning in the first two rounds Both top seeds (Patriots, Falcons) and the previous year's Super Bowl teams (Saints, Colts ) went one-and-done with Tom Brady, Matt Ryan, Drew Brees and Peyton Manning at quarterback The Packers won the Super Bowl as a six seed after making the playoffs on a strength-of-victory tiebreaker Slow start by top five teams in preseason title odds is historic Basically, all hell broke loose. We are headed for destruction again in 2025, with all the heavyweights struggling at the start of the season. This is why oddsmakers don't have a clear favorite right now. The preseason top five Super Bowl favorites were the Eagles , Ravens , Bills, Chiefs and Lions . They are a combined 16-14 this season, including 2-8 in the last two weeks. They were 69-16 last season. 2025 Preseason Top Five Title Favorites Eagles +700 4-2 Ravens +700 1-5 Bills +700 4-2 Chiefs +800 3-3 Lions +1000 4-2 2010 wasn't a fluke. Anytime the juggernauts stumble out of the blocks, there's a surprise Super Bowl champion. That 16-14 record is the worst among the top five preseason title favorites entering Week 7 since 2010. If you look at all the instances in the last three decades where the top five teams were slow out of the gate, it's ugly. I've highlighted in red the eight seasons where the win percentage was under 60% at this point in the year. None of the eventual champs those years ranked better than fifth in preseason title odds. They averaged 13th. The 1999 Rams , 2001 Patriots, 2010 Packers and 2017 Eagles were shocking Super Bowl champions. The 2002 Buccaneers , 2003 Patriots and 2008 Steelers had an element of surprise, too. I expect history to repeat itself as these contenders look very vulnerable. Why top five teams in preseason title odds are struggling Eagles (trenches) The Eagles lost a lot of talent up front and they have been getting bullied. They lost right guard Mekhi Becton , defensive end Josh Sweat and defensive tackle Milton Williams this offseason. Plus, edge rusher Nolan Smith is on injured reserve and Za'Darius Smith just retired. Jalen Carter is also hurt at the moment. Philadelphia is one of two teams ranking in the bottom five in the NFL in rush yards differential (29th) and sack differential (29th) this season, along with the 1-5 Titans . We can't just chalk up the ground game issues to a slow start by Saquon Barkley . After all, Giants rookies Jaxson Dart and Cam Skattebo just punched them in the mouth. The Eagles were outrushed by 99 yards on 'Thursday Night Football' last week. They are 26th in success rate defending the run this year, vs. ninth last year. The pass rush is probably the most worrisome, especially after it was the Eagles' meal ticket against Patrick Mahomes in the Super Bowl. Philly ranks 23rd in pressure rate without blitzing this season. They were third a year ago. And I haven't even gotten to A.J. Brown and the identity issues on offense with new offensive coordinator Kevin Patullo. The offense should recover, but the fatal flaw could be the four-man pass rush. They could improve when Nolan Smith and Jalen Carter get healthy, or if they make a trade, but I doubt it'll replicate what last year's unit did. Ravens (defense) The 2025 Ravens were the first team in the Super Bowl era to allow 37+ points in four of their first five games. The defense, injured or not, has been a disaster. They are fourth-worst in pressure rate and sack rate this year, as they have been unable to solve a problem that has plagued them for a few years. Find a star edge rusher. The big-name secondary hasn't delivered yet, either. The Ravens have allowed the most completions on throws of 15+ air yards this season (26). They solved their defensive issues in the second half last year by moving Kyle Hamilton to deep safety, but they'll need a new solution in 2025 as they plan on using Hamilton all over the field the rest of the way. I fully expect the Ravens to make a run at the AFC North title, assuming Lamar Jackson and guys like Roquan Smith, Kyle Hamilton and Marlon Humphrey are healthy out of the bye week with a soft upcoming schedule. Still, an unreliable Lamar Jackson in the postseason, combined with a shaky defense, spells trouble in January, again. Bills (run defense) There are many reasons the Bills have lost two straight games, leading us to question their credentials in the AFC East, as Zach Pereles wrote this week . The fact that they've played the easiest schedule to date and the Patriots have the easiest road the rest of the way doesn't help matters. The biggest reason to raise an eyebrow, though, is their run defense. They've allowed the most yards per rush through six games by any team in the Super Bowl era (5.8) and just got torched by Bijan Robinson . If they solve the run defense, then they still don't have solutions for the reasons they didn't get over the hump last year. No go-to target and no stud pass rusher. The Bills have one touchdown catch by a wide receiver on throws of 20+ air yards in the last two seasons, the fewest in the NFL. Chiefs (big plays) The Chiefs probably have the best outlook of any of these teams, as their offense is hitting its stride and they are finally going to be at full strength on that side of the ball with Rashee Rice returning. Still, I'll need a bigger sample to believe they are all the way back. Patrick Mahomes has the worst completion rate on throws of 20+ air yards (27%) in the last three seasons among the top 25 passers in attempts on those deep balls. The offense has been pedestrian in the last three seasons and the sluggish start is why the Chiefs stumbled to an 0-2 start. I still don't trust the Lions, no matter how good they look at times, between the razzle dazzle on offense, an efficient Jared Goff, 'Sonic and Knuckles', and Dan Campbell. I have too much Goff PTSD. He's wildly inconsistent in big games, especially lately. The Lions offense didn't show up in Green Bay or Kansas City in their two losses this year. Goff is 4-5 with nine interceptions in the last two seasons vs. teams that have a top-10 record in the NFL over that span. He's 15-0 with eight interceptions vs. everyone else. That's pretty ugly and his five-interception game in Houston last year is included with the 15-0 mark. Jared Goff last two seasons, including playoffs W-L 4-5 15-0 Yards per attempt 7.2 9.4 TD-INT 16-9 36-8 Top teams always have an Achilles heel. This year, we'll find out if they are fatal flaws. Right now, I'm betting yes based on the issues laid out above and an intriguing middle class with the Rams, Colts, Buccaneers, Broncos, Seahawks, Patriots, Falcons and more waiting in the wings.",https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/nfl-powerhouses-eagles-bills-ravens-chiefs-and-lions-struggling-as-super-bowl-race-is-wide-open,Sport,cbssports.com,,https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2025/10/16/412e4b70-b3c5-4483-8792-68a8de96f34f/thumbnail/1200x675/017adb9149e4167f7c743711d071e6b6/josh-allen-bills-g.jpg,2025-10-16T13:45:00+00:00,a1d074dfb018ae3beaa4c43b40ac192dc092a6f7
e2425b2b9fee,The Conversation: Can the Heat reinvent themselves again after the Jimmy Butler era?,,"Remember when Miami Heat coach Erik Spoelstra visited Chip Kelly at the University of Oregon and came back preaching ""pace and space?"" He made that trip in the summer of 2011, a couple of months after the Heat fell apart in the Finals against the Dallas Mavericks . As transformative it was for that version of the team, though, recent ones have had a decidedly different style. From 2019-20 (i.e. Year 1 of the Jimmy Butler era) to last season, Miami ranked 29th, 26th, 24th, 27th, 29th and 28th in offensive pace, per Inpredictable . Now that the Butler era is over, Spoelstra and his staff are once again thinking quick. ""We had some rules during the practice, like you got to get the ball over half-court in four seconds or it's a turnover and stuff like that,"" Miami forward Nikola Jović said last week, via the Miami Herald . ""Just to get our minds wrapped around that we have to play faster."" After the Heat's offense ranked No. 21 in the 2024-25 regular season and completely crumbled in their first-round series against the Cleveland Cavaliers , they want to speed things up in the halfcourt, too. Between this and an opportunistic offseason trade for Norman Powell , Miami is not the same team that it was in the immediate aftermath of the Butler trade. With Tyler Herro out until at least mid-November , though, it's not clear how much of a difference these changes will make. The State of Play Last year: Butler forced his way out of Miami, getting traded to the Warriors after three separate suspensions. The Heat were 21-21 following Butler's final game on Jan. 21, and they were 24-24 when, in the middle of a game against the Sixers, they agreed to the deal. In exchange for Butler, Josh Richardson and a 2026 second-round pick, Miami got Andrew Wiggins , Kyle Anderson , Davion Mitchell and Golden State's 2025 first-round pick. The team immediately went into a tailspin, but, after falling to 29-41, the Heat won eight of their next 11 games, qualified for the play-in and then beat both the Bulls and the Hawks to earn the eighth seed ... only for the top-seeded Cavaliers to annihiilate them in a four-game sweep that Pat Riley would describe as ""humbling."" The offseason: Miami drafted guard Kasparas Jakučionis with the No. 20 pick it got from the Warriors; re-signed Mitchell to a two-year, $24 million contract; signed Nikola Jović to a four-year, $64.4 million extension; signed-and-traded Duncan Robinson (on a three-year, $48 million deal) to Detroit for Simone Fontecchio , gave up a 2032 second-round pick to send Haywood Highsmith to Brooklyn and reunited with Precious Achiuwa on a one-year minimum deal. The biggest move the Heat made, though, was getting Powell from the Clippers in a deal that only cost them Anderson and Kevin Love . Vegas over/under: 37.5 wins, per FanDuel SportsBook The Conversation Heat believer: I'm amused by all the projections that have the 2025-26 Heat finishing with fewer than 40 wins. I don't need a statistical model to tell me how this season is going to go because I've seen Erik Spoelstra work his magic with rosters like this before. This is a classic Heat team: Not top-heavy like they were in the Big 3 era, but deep with competitive guys who are going to grind out more wins than people think. The summer that they had should be getting more attention! The Norman Powell trade was a masterstroke, Kasparas Jakučionis was a steal and Simone Fontecchio is exactly the type of guy who tends to pop up in Miami and immediately have a career year. To me, the Heat winning 30-something games is less likely than them starting at an above-.500 pace, making a win-now trade and pushing 50 wins. Heat skeptic: Those projections seem fair to me. I don't doubt that the Heat can get stops, but, uh, what about offense? Is there a reason to expect they will get to the rim and the free-throw line more often than they did at the end of last season? Are they going to grab way more offensive rebounds? Take way more 3s? I haven't forgotten how hopeless they looked against the Cavs in the first round, and I'm not that jazzed about the roster as presently constructed. The Powell trade was a win, value-wise, and he'll help them survive without Tyler Herro early in the season, but he and Herro have duplicative skill sets. If they don't make another big move, this is probably a play-in team again. Heat believer: You're underestimating the Heat and overestimating the rest of the East. I'm telling you, this is the sort of team Spoelstra has maximized before. They're going to turn defense into offense, and, when they are in the halfcourt, there's going to be more movement and much less matchup-hunting. Powell and Bam Adebayo are going to work beautifully together, Nikola Jović's playmaking is really going to pop in the new system and Jaime Jaquez Jr . is going to bounce back after a shaky sophomore season. I have no doubt that this team will be better than 2025-26 iterations of the Celtics and Pacers , and I'm not particularly optimistic about Giannis Antetokounmpo 's supporting cast or Joel Embiid 's health. If the Cavs, Knicks and Magic represent the East's top tier, then Miami is firmly in the second tier with the Pistons and Hawks. Heat skeptic: I'd sooner put the Heat with the Raptors and Bulls, other teams that could theoretically make the playoffs in a weak year but don't have a particularly high ceiling. If I'm wrong, though, it'll probably be because Kel'El Ware breaks out. Given the numbers he has put up in the preseason , I'm surprised you haven't even brought him up yet. Maybe I'm scarred from the Hassan Whiteside experience, but, especially after Spoelstra called out Ware for a lack of professionalism and consistency in his approach in July, I'm hesitant to get too excited about the preseason stuff. My expectation is that Jović will start at the 4 and the Ware-Adebayo frontcourt will only be seen in small doses. Heat believer: So you're saying you're Ware-y about playing the two bigs together? Got it! But seriously, you should adjust those expectations. Ware is simply too talented for your plan. He needs to play at least 25-30 minutes a night, and that's not happening unless he's sharing the court with Adebayo. Also, it's not like the Heat have a ton of other options at the 4, and that's probably intentional. If you have two extremely mobile bigs who can play inside and out, you have to see what they can do together. Spoelstra will figure out the right pieces to put around them. Heat skeptic: The other option is to play guys like Wiggins and Jaquez at the 4 a lot, since Miami salary-dumped Haywood Highsmith in the summer. (That was a bummer, by the way.) I know that isn't ideal, though, and this reinforces what I've been saying here: Miami is mid, man. I'd much rather bring Davion Mitchell off the bench than make him my starting point guard, but, on this team, I'd reluctantly start him for the sake of point-of-attack defense. I don't think the double-big look jibes with the plan to push the ball and make quick decisions, but you might be right about them going to it anyway. You are absolutely right that Spoelstra has solved plenty of lineup problems and overachieved with players who'd been cast aside by other teams. But turning this particular group into a second-tier playoff team seems like too tall of a task.",https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/the-conversation-can-the-heat-reinvent-themselves-again-after-the-jimmy-butler-era,Sport,cbssports.com,,https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2025/10/16/a6473eba-59e6-4bc3-843d-81de67be3c54/thumbnail/1200x675/8dd0ba1449d677d7f3e8f3ae94fcc0c4/spolestra-heat-getty.png,2025-10-16T13:41:51+00:00,0ea336fcc709f0f72d159b0e7778cf814dfb7d05

Pittsburgh (4-1) has won three straight, including a 23-9 victory over Cleveland on Sunday, and the Steelers are 2-0 on the road this season. Cincinnati (2-4) has lost four in a row since losing Joe Burrow to injury, and the Bengals suffered a 27-18 loss to Green Bay in Week 6. These teams split their two matchups last season, with the road team winning each game. Cincinnati defensive end Trey Hendrickson (hip) is questionable after not practicing on Wednesday, while tight end Mike Gesicki (pec) has been placed on injured reserve. Kickoff is at 8:15 p.m. ET from Paycor Stadium in Cincinnati, and Pittsburgh has won each of its last three trips to Cincy.

Aaron Rodgers ' 105.4 passer rating is the sixth-highest of his career, and of the five years in which he had a better rating, he won NFL MVP in four of them. Rodgers also has the third-highest completion percentage and touchdown rate of his career, while his pairing with DK Metcalf has hit its stride. The former Seahawk has touchdown receptions in four straight games, as he's just one touchdown catch away from matching his total from last season (five). The Steelers' +7 turnover differential is the second-best in the league, and even if they don't notch a takeaway, the defense can still produce elite performances. That's what occurred on Sunday as Pittsburgh's nine points allowed to Cleveland were the fewest the Steelers have given up all year. Another dominant defensive effort can be expected on Thursday versus a Cincinnati team which ranks in the bottom four in the key stats of points scored, yards gained, rushing offense and passing offense. See which team to back at SportsLine . Why the Bengals can cover Cincinnati is coming off a road loss to Green Bay, but there were some promising signs for the Bengals. One is that the team covered, after losing three straight ATS, and another was the performance of Joe Flacco , just days after being acquired by the team. Flacco provided a spark for the offense as he had two touchdown passes and no turnovers, compared to Jake Browning , who failed to have more touchdowns than turnovers in any of his four games. Ja'Marr Chase had a 10-94-1 stat line as his 12th career game with 10-plus catches and a touchdown are now tied for fourth-most in NFL history. Cincy is a perfect 4 for 4 in red-zone scoring over their last two games, and it ranks second in the NFL in red-zone conversion percentage this season. That could be a bad omen for Pittsburgh, as its defense isn't quite on par with prior seasons. The Steelers are 26th in total defense, 27th in passing defense and haven't experienced much recent success in flustering Flacco. The 40-year-old has played turnover-free ball versus the Steelers over his last three games versus them. See which team to back at SportsLine .

8184a5dd9954,The M for Montreal Festival: A Showcase for North America’s Most Overlooked Music City,,"Montreal is the most overlooked music city in North America. There are several reasons why. It’s in the upper-right corner of the continent, around 350 miles away from both New York and Toronto, a bit out of the way for touring artists unless they’re starting or ending a tour there. Yes, it gets pretty cold in the winter and yes, French — or more accurately Québécois — is the first language. But it’s a beautiful metropolis of over 4 million people just 90 minutes by air from those two cities; nearly everyone speaks fluent English even if they don’t lead with it; the summer weather is gorgeous; and it has a vibrant, diverse, government-supported music scene that packs the city’s thriving venues year-round and is on a par with (or stronger than) virtually any city of its size on the continent. Who has come out of Montreal? The city’s musical patron saint, Leonard Cohen , along with Arcade Fire, Alison Russell, Grimes, Godspeed You! Black Emperor, Anna & Kate McGarrigle, the Wainright siblings, Tegan & Sara, Charlotte Cardin, Mac DeMarco, Wolf Parade, Simple Plan, the Stills, Suuns and many more (and of course Joni Mitchell played the city’s folk scene extensively early in her career) — all of them independent-minded, determined musicians whose attitudes reflect the city’s spirit. Any music fan or industry person looking for an inspiration to visit can find a prime opportunity in the 20th annual edition of the M for Montreal festival , taking place from November 19-22. It features dozens of Canadian, Québécois and international acts performing at venues all over the city for more than 500 “delegates” (i.e. attendees) including label execs, agents, bookers, and media from all over the world, many of whom speak at the festival’s daytime conference. The goal is not only to promote Montreal as a music city but to amplify the festival’s artists beyond Canada, which it helped to do for Grimes, DeMarco, Cardin, Men I Trust and many others. An informal survey for this year’s highlights includes electronic rockers Choses Sauvages; the long-running instrumental outfit BadBadNotGood‚ who are playing the festival for the first time since 2014; Fine Food Market, a dream-pop outlet of singer-songwriter Sophie Perras; the dark electronic pop acts Apacalda and Kandle; Grammy-winning musician-composer Colin Stetson (who has collaborated with Arcade Fire and Bon Iver); Toronto-based indie rockers Kiwi Jr.; veteran Philadelphia rap group Digable Planets; a solo set from Welsh group Super Furry Animals’ lead singer Gruff Rhys; and even Montreal psychedelic veterans the Besnard Lakes, who played the first M for Montreal festival in 2006 (see the full lineup on the festival website here , and see the official playlist below). The event was launched by local musician/manager Sébastien Nasra and veteran British executive Martin Elbourne, a former agent who has founded several music festivals around the world, including Britain’s Great Escape. A year later Mikey Rishwain Bernard joined the team, eventually rising to artistic director and the festival’s key ambassador. Bernard was raised in both Quebec and California, giving him an unusual range of contacts and experience — and he was so excited by the scene emerging in Montreal in the mid-‘00s, featuring many of the above-named acts, that he moved back. “I saw everything that was happening here and the strong support from the government, and I got FOMO,” he recalls with a laugh, “so I left my apartment in California and came straight to Montreal. I wanted to be part of something that was speaking to the whole community, not just a certain roster, like a label or an agency does. And the glory of M for Montreal is you get to work with everybody, from the industry to the artists, and all different genres.” The variety of talent on display at the festival this year supports that. Bernard estimates that approximately 70% of the artists are Canadian (with around 60% of those from Quebec), with the remainder primarily from the U.S. and Europe, particularly countries with which the festival has a partnership: fellow outliers Wales, the Czech Republic, and the Basque region of France and Spain. What will a curious visitor to the city find? A dedicated and determined DIY music culture that developed for many of the reasons mentioned above, but one that also taps into Quebec’s fiercely independent and rebellious nature (there’s an anarchist bookstore in the middle of downtown Montreal), with the substantial bonus of government support for the arts. “We’re non-profit, so we’re giving everything back to the community,” Bernard says. “I’ve spent a lot of time in different scenes in Southern and Northern California, but I saw something special and more unique in Montreal. I still don’t know of another place like it.” A busy recent weekend in the city saw Variety visiting multiple venues, all of which were packed: the Piknic Electronik outdoor electronic music festival at the city’s Parc Jean Drapeau on an island in the middle of the St. Lawrence River (easily accessible by metro); Manitoba quintet Foxwarren at the 580-capacity Theatre Fairmount; a densely crowded Wet Leg show at the 2,800-cap M Telus; and several music-themed bars on a corner known as “The Triangle” in Le Plateau neighborhood (the names are hazy). It all concluded late Saturday night at the legendary venue Foufounes électriques, which has been the heart of the city’s music scene since 1983 — nearly every veteran has been there several dozen times over the years, and at least three people we met told stories about how their lives in music essentially began when they snuck in as underaged teens. An unexpectedly large venue, Foufounes is located on a major street just north of Montreal’s touristy Old Town and has two floors: a large downstairs bar and performance area, and two smaller upstairs rooms. We arrived too late on this particular evening/morning to catch the headlining act, but one upstairs room featured a sort of goth dance night (which explained the multiple people dressed like members of Sleep Token at the downstairs bar) while the other hosted a deafening death metal band. It’s Montreal’s equivalent of New York’s late, lamented CBGB or Washington DC’s 9:30 Club — the kind of venue that is not only a foundation of the local scene but also hosted the first area show for countless future superstars. Nirvana played there twice: first in April of 1990 and again 18 months later as the second date of the literally world-changing “Nevermind” tour. Over the years everyone from Marianne Faithfull to Green Day, from the Pixies to Nine Inch Nails, from LL Cool J to the Smashing Pumpkins has performed there, but it remains primarily a rock venue, and a refreshingly old-school one at that. The current crop of independent music companies share that spirit. A key influence is Constellation, the ferociously independent label launched by the Godspeed camp in the mid-1990s, which has served as a mentor to many of the current generation’s entrepreneurs. Two of the city’s most prominent success stories are Cult Nation, home to Charlotte Cardin and rising stars Lubalin and Chiara Navasta; and Arbutus, which helped launch the careers of Grimes and Mac DeMarco and currently Fine Food Mart and the indie rock band Tops. Both are multifaceted companies that not only include label and management but also a commercial music wing and video-production unit (the former) and a radio station and restaurant/nightclub (the latter). Cult Nation was founded by musician-producer Jason Brando after he and Cardin met while both were working on music for an advertisement to pay the bills. They began working together and Brando, who’d always wanted to start a label, took the plunge in 2015. “I had no real business background,” he says. “I basically learned everything by making mistakes.” Those were some productive mistakes: Cardin, who is essentially the label’s franchise artist, has racked up a billion global streams, a four-times platinum album in Canada (for her latest “Confetti”), has sold out Quebec City’s 10,000-capacity Place Bell four times; her concert at Paris’ Accor Arena next April is already sold out. (Cardin started as primarily an English-language singer but her career has taken off in France, where she now lives.) The company is based in a spacious, window-lined office-studio complex on the second floor of a former industrial building in the city’s Mile End neighborhood. Tasteful art and multiple SOCAN Awards hang on the walls; the ample daylight (even in the studios) and open spaces give an upbeat vibe; there’s a tidiness that implies a focus that is also reflected in the releases from its artists, who fall broadly under an indie-pop (or pop-indie) genre. Not far away is the home base of Arbutus , founded by Vancouver native Sebastian Cowan in 2009. The company was built on the early success of Grimes, for whom he basically served as manager, label and all-around Swiss Army Knife until they parted ways several years ago. Cowan started his career in music by organizing warehouse dance parties — that sort of bootstrap approach permeates nearly every aspect of the company — and lived in London for several years before moving to Montreal. While in the U.K., he learned his label chops by working closely with Martin Mills’ Beggars Group empire (which may well be the longest-lasting and most successful independent music company of the last 50 years), yet he took just as much from Constellation co-founder Don Wilkie; not coincidentally, both Mills and Wilkie operate from a philosophy that the label and the artist are true partners. The company and radio station operate out of the upper floors of a building in the Rosemont neighborhood; on the ground floor is le Systeme, a combination venue/ restaurant , because Cowan “wanted a storefront for the company” (he owns the building). “I was able to purchase a four-story commercial building and launch an internet radio station, bar and label — all self-financed, in a major city,” he says. “That demonstrates the opportunity that Montreal uniquely affords: In New York or London, projects don’t get off the ground without a millionaire backing it — that’s not the case here. Anyone with a good idea and a lot of hard work can start something, and they regularly do.” He adds that M for Montreal has played “such a huge role” in the company’s success by bringing international attention to both the artists and the city. Bernard adds, “Montreal has always been our focus, but our goal is to give some shine to all of Canada” (indeed, at one point he was heard telling a coworker, “I need to up my Manitoba game”). “And we’ve helped get rid of the stereotype that Quebec is hard to work with because it’s French. That’s bullshit: everyone speaks English, and this is an industry that we all share together. “Part of our goal,” he concludes, “is to put people in situations where they become friends.”",https://variety.com/2025/music/news/m-for-montreal-festival-showcase-north-americas-most-overlooked-music-city-1236554288,Entertainment,variety.com,Jem Aswad,https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/M4M-_CamilleGladu_nov-3035.jpg?w=1000&h=563&crop=1,2025-10-16T14:30:08+00:00,03a96de7ecc6944c82d5fc626e55f03e46d9de54

In the film, Tomnikov plays a 30-something trauma survivor named Heloisa who arrives at a summer cottage with her new boyfriend and discovers that her boyfriend’s mother, a woman named Anu, is her former psychotherapist with whom Heloisa had fallen out. Finnish actress and singer Jonna Järnefelt (“Abandoned Houses, Empty Homes”) plays Anu. “‘How to Shout’ is a film about an obsessive relationship and the power dynamics between a psychotherapist and a patient,” Rautinainen said in her director’s statement. “Through this unique human connection at the heart of the story, I wanted to explore the different forms of violence and the traces they leave behind, as well as aggression — approaching these themes with as humane and non-violent a perspective as possible.” Summerside Media, which is known for its slate of emerging voices and auteur-driven cinema, acquired rights outside the Nordics from Finnish production company Cinemanifest. Nordic distribution is being handled by Nordisk Film, which has set the Finnish premiere of “How to Shout” later this month. “We are truly excited to be handling international sales for ‘How to Shout,’ a striking debut by such a promising Finnish director” said Summerside Media chief Francesca Manno. “We’ve always felt a special connection with the Finnish film industry — having taken part in the Finnish Film Affair several times over the years, and proudly represented several Finnish titles.” Manno will be kicking off sales on “How to Shout” at the upcoming Tallinn Black Nights Festival.

There’s a self-help book (“Own It: The Secret to Life”); a coffee-table tome of some of her best looks (“Diane von Furstenberg: Woman Before Fashion”); a small novelty book in Italian, which I don’t speak (“Serenissima: Solution & Seduction”); and a book about the Statue of Liberty, because she served as the monument’s “godmother” during a fundraising event. “I thought it was a better title than being on the board,” she says of the self-invented appointment. The godmother of Liberty suits her well — after all, in her very best book, the 2014 memoir “The Woman I Wanted to Be,” von Furstenberg spills on all her adventures. The daughter of a Holocaust survivor, von Furstenberg came to New York in 1969, after a whirlwind adolescence of traveling in Europe, and changed fashion with the wrap dress, which she debuted in 1973. When she got to the city, von Furstenberg was already royalty as the socialite wife of Germany’s Prince Egon von Fürstenberg; she soon ruled the party scene too. After becoming a self-made millionaire, she bought herself an apartment on Park Avenue and a farm in Connecticut. In 2001, she married a second time, to the Hollywood mogul Barry Diller, reinventing herself as part of another New York power couple. Today, von Furstenberg splits her time between her farm, Cloudwalk, where she lives; New York, where she works; and Venice, Italy, where she plays. “I read a biography of Venice, and I realized Venice is a woman,” she says. Feminism is often on DVF’s mind, and she says her family refers to her as an “oracle or a goat.” Why a goat? “I climb,” she says. At 78, she’s talking to me because she’s agreed to accept the Perelman Performing Arts Center NYC Icon of Culture award. But DVF doesn’t like awards. She begrudgingly agreed to accept after former Mayor Michael Bloomberg invited her. She told Bloomberg she would appear at the Oct. 28 gala only if the event’s organizers roasted her. OK McCausland for Vareity In person, DVF is so modest, she’d rather talk about anything other than her achievements. “Ramin, are you Persian? I speak Persian,” she says, and she offers me a few sassy phrases in Farsi. Only with some prodding does she acknowledge her place in fashion history. But once she gets going, the stories spill out of her. After an hour, she sends me home with Sharpie-written inscriptions to me in all her tomes and some magical tales that only a New York godmother could spin. Congratulations on your award. Michael Bloomberg will be at the celebration. He called me and said, “You’re the only icon I know, so you have to say yes.” I was totally embarrassed. I said, “I don’t want to do this. The only way I agree is if you make it a comedy.” Is it because you’re at a place in your life where laughter is important? No. Because otherwise it’s boring. And embarrassing. But if you do it as a comedy, it’s fun hopefully. What does it mean to be an icon of culture in New York? I don’t know. It means you’ve lived a long time and you’ve been around a long time. Have I shaped our culture? I don’t know. I lived our culture. Diane von Furstenberg in the early 1970s Courtesy of Diane von Furstenberg But you also changed our culture. I don’t know if I changed it. I witnessed it. I changed it with the dress. With the invention of the wrap dress, you were suddenly a star. You were featured on the cover of Newsweek in 1976, and you made fashion more affordable. I definitely did that. I would drive from Park Avenue to Seventh Avenue and count the dresses on the street. They were everywhere. And at a point, I was making 25,000 wrap dresses a week. Every woman in America had one. Five. Twenty! That’s why it saturated the first time around. Instead of being an elitist, it let everyone look good. Also, QVC — I brought Barry there. [In 1992, Diller became head of QVC, and von Furstenberg appeared on the channel, selling her latest designs.] I brought everyone there — Marc Jacobs. Karl Lagerfeld made a drawing of me in a crystal ball like a magician in the TV. I have it somewhere. But you forget all the things you do. Sometimes I talk to kids: “Oh, I knew this one.” I don’t want to say it, because it’s like I’m boasting. I’ve known everyone my age who went around New York. I knew Andy Warhol. Hillary Clinton, Alyse Nelson and von Furstenberg in Venice in 2022 Courtesy of Diane von Furstenberg What was Warhol like? Andy Warhol never spoke. He wanted to know about you. He would photograph you, tape you. He was a voyeur. He is the one who created the idea of the icon. He lived in New York with his mother. His mother was very religious. In Greek churches or in Russian churches, you have lots of icons. When you first moved to New York, as a socialite you threw infamous parties with Prince Egon. Madonna came to one before she was Madonna. She was already Madonna, but no one knew her. She was 19. She came with a big brown hat, and she talked the entire time to my mother. OK, let’s talk about DVF as a brand. You recently took back control from a company in China. We have taken control back of the product. [ Her cellphone rings. She picks it up and says, in Italian, that she’s in a meeting: “Ciao.” ] It’s the last thing I wanted to do. In this stage of my life, where I am, I’m 78 years old. I’m in the winter of my life. It’s very important I take all the things I learn, accomplish, experienced, and all the connections that I have to kind of put it in a bundle and try to make sense of it and try to make other people benefit from it. How do you do that? I discovered the power of kindness. That is going to be my main focus for whatever time I have left. Kindness is a currency — like money, it compounds. Of course, it’s a virtue. It’s a tool. It’s a trick. It’s a muscle. Once you start practicing it, it’s a wonderful thing. I have a little manifesto which I’ll give you: Connect. Every day I make one miracle by introducing one person to a person who can change their life. I don’t need to speak. All I need to do is a nice, meaningful, thoughtful email — and a miracle happens! Barry Diller and von Furstenberg at the opening of Manhattan’s High Line in 2009 Courtesy of Diane von Furstenberg As a designer, you always told your models to smile on the runway. Very important. Before the show, I’d say, “Be the woman you want to be — and smile.” They’d look at me, because no one ever wants them to smile. I don’t know why. What is most beautiful in a woman is the eye contact, the smile and the body language. Or sometimes I would say, “Don’t behave like a model. Just be the woman. And when you look at the camera, think of your boyfriend. Seduce the camera.” I used a less attractive word. How has New York changed in your lifetime? When I came to live here, it was 1970. It was dirty, cheap and dangerous. It was dangerous and therefore cheap. And because it was cheap, you had a lot of artists. New York was great because it didn’t cost anything. I used to go to the supermarket and pay $50 for 25 people. And you helped revitalize the Meatpacking District by bringing DVF here. And now the Meatpacking District is synonymous with fashion and luxury. That I did. I bought a carriage house on West 12th Street. Everybody thought I was crazy. But I’d started my company again and thought, “Why pay rent uptown?” All the hard bars were still here. I got involved. We made the High Line happen. And then Barry came after me. He renovated the pier. It was his dream, and it was a wonderful thing. I wanted to ask you about your marriage to Barry, the great love of your life. He turned out to be my soulmate. I didn’t think of it at first. He was a man about town. I was giving a party for Sue Mengers, and he came. I was interested in being a good friend; I never thought it would be anything else. Then it turned to passion. He was very insistent. He called me the next day, and then we had dinner. And then I went to Paris, and he called me: “Why don’t you come to L.A.?” I made a stop in Montreal. I called the boyfriend I had at the time to tell him I was going to L.A. to meet someone else. Barry came to pick me up. He had a limousine for my luggage. Did he say that in his book? Diane von Furstenberg in New York, NY, 1974 Jill Krementz/Courtesy of Diane von Furstenberg You write about that in your book. In his book, “Who Knew,” released this year, he made the decision to come out as a gay man. Can you talk about supporting him in doing that? Supporting him? What do you mean, supporting him ? People see it that way. For me, it’s not that way. I don’t know. Yes, I encouraged him to do that book, and yes, I encouraged him to do the Audible. But for me, the book is not about that. It’s about his life. And of course, with me, he opened immediately. For 50 years, I was the only person he opened to. Then he wrote the book. What does it mean to be a woman married to a man who’s gay? What’s the difference? I don’t understand. A lot of women wouldn’t want to be married to a gay man. But it doesn’t change anything. I’m sorry — it’s a stupid question. I married two gay men, OK? I don’t know why, but to me, they’re not gay, so it doesn’t make any difference. I think I understand. Were there any downsides to becoming successful so young? No, of course not. Then you can make mistakes. I thought I would die by the time I was 30 because I had done everything. But I didn’t. Strangely enough, I feel the same energy I felt in those early years. How would you describe your business in the year 2025? The brand more than the business. The brand is really about: We make clothes for the woman in charge. It’s to give women confidence and to make them feel sexy on the go, ready to go. They’re a woman’s best friend in the closet. I stick to the closet: The clothes come out of the closet, the men come out of the closet! The closet is very important. Do you have a large closet? Yeah, in the country, I have archives. I am an archive too. I’m an archive in the closet. No, I’m not in the closet at all. I wasn’t asking that. In your book you write about choosing your own burial place in a patch of land on your ranch in Connecticut. Every Saturday with my son, we used to walk: “Oh, where should we be buried?” It was there, it was there and it was there. I got a little bit more land, and it was there. And then I made it a real cemetery. You have to go to town so it’s official. DVF wearing a shirt dress. Initially the cube was blank, and she thought it looked too plain, so she wrote – feel like a woman, wear a dress! Courtesy of Diane von Furstenberg Is it comforting knowing your resting place? Yes. But then I could be pulverized in a plane. You’re not in control of everything. If there was a movie about your life, who would play you? I used to say somebody, and then they aged. I don’t know. There have been plenty of documentaries. One day there might be a movie. But it won’t be as good as the movie I lived.

57093c446458,Apple’s Steve Jobs to Appear on $1 U.S. Coin: ‘Make Something Wonderful’,,"Steve Jobs , the legendary co-founder and CEO of Apple , will be honored with a special 2026 commemorative $1 coin from the U.S. Mint. The $1 Jobs coin — which will cost $13.25 when it goes on sale next year — depicts the tech exec as a young man “sitting in front of a quintessentially northern California landscape of oak-covered rolling hills,” according to the U.S. Mint. “His posture and expression, as he is captured in a moment of reflection, show how this environment inspired his vision to transform complex technology into something as intuitive and organic as nature itself.” The coin is inscribed with “Steve Jobs” and “Make Something Wonderful,” which is the name of the book published in 2023 with a collection of Jobs’ writings, interviews and speeches. Jobs died of pancreatic cancer in 2011 at the age of 56. The two-time Apple CEO launched several revolutionary computers, including the Apple II – one of the first mass-produced personal computers – and the Macintosh. He went on to oversee the company’s introduction of category-defining products including the iPod, iPhone and iPad. Jobs also was co-founder and CEO of Pixar Animation Studios, bringing to life the industry’s first fully computer-animated feature, “Toy Story.” California Gov. Gavin Newsom had earlier this year nominated Jobs to appear on the state’s American Innovation Coin. “Innovation and California are synonymous, and Steve Jobs encapsulates the unique brand of innovation that California runs on: innovation not driven by business alone, but as a vehicle to forever change the world,” Newsom said in a statement. Jobs, who was born in San Francisco and spent most of his life in California, once said about the state, “California has a sense of experimentation about it, and a sense of openness about it — openness and new possibility — that I really didn’t appreciate ’til I went to other places.” The forthcoming Jobs coin is part of the Mint’s “American Innovation” $1 coin series. Launched in 2018, the designs are aimed to be “emblematic of innovation” in each of the 50 states, the District of Columbia, and the five U.S. territories. Three other American Innovation coins for 2026 will feature Dr. Norman Borlaug, the agricultural pioneer dubbed “the father of the Green Revolution” (Iowa); the Cray-1 supercomputer (Wisconsin); and mobile refrigeration, showing a 1940s-era truck with an early front-mounted refrigeration unit (Minnesota). The design on the obverse (i.e. the heads side) of the American Innovation $1 Coins features “a dramatic representation of the Statue of Liberty in profile” with the inscriptions “In God We Trust” and “$1.” According to the U.S. Mint, each annual obverse design also includes a unique privy mark of a stylized gear, representing industry and innovation; the 2026 coins’ privy mark will also incorporate a Liberty Bell with the inscription “250” to commemorate the semiquincentennial of the country’s founding. The edge-incused inscriptions are “2026,” the mint mark, and “E Pluribus Unum.” RELATED: How Steve Jobs Courted Hollywood",https://variety.com/2025/digital/news/steve-jobs-1-dollar-us-coin-american-innovation-1236554423,Entertainment,variety.com,Todd Spangler,https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Steve-Jobs-1-Coin-US-Mint-2026-American-Innovation.png?w=1000&h=563&crop=1,2025-10-16T13:56:43+00:00,5ab77930b036812f638fc224d8315fd102fc5e66
3b0039aec904,Madagascar’s military power grab shows Africa’s coup problem isn’t restricted to the Sahel region,"africa, burkina faso, chad, coups, gabon, good governance, governance, guinea, madagascar, mali, niger, political violence, poverty, revolution, sudan","Those who rise to power through a coup often fall by the same means . That is one of the takeaways from events in Madagascar, where on Oct. 14, 2025, the military seized power after weeks of protests largely driven by Gen Z. Ironically, it was the same elite military unit that helped bring Andry Rajoelina , former mayor of the capital Antananarivo, to power in a March 2009 coup that now supported anti-government protesters and ultimately forced the president to flee. I lead a research team that compiles the Colpus Dataset of coup types and characteristics and have written on the history of coups d’état from 1946 through 2025. Our data suggests that even as coups have declined globally overall, coup risk remains comparatively high in Africa. Since 2020, the continent has now seen 10 successful coups across eight countries. But the military takeover in Madagascar marks only the second coup in that period to take place outside of the Sahel region , stretching from the Atlantic to the Horn of Africa – a signal that Africa’s coup problem is becoming a continental one. But why do some coups succeed and others fail? And why do Madagascar and various states in Africa have trouble escaping so-called coup traps ? Our data provides some answers. But first it is worth exploring what we mean when we use the term coup. What is a coup? A coup d’état is a seizure of executive power involving one or more concrete, observable and illegal actions by security personnel or civilian officials. Here, Madagascar’s military takeover appears to qualify. Despite claims by the country’s new military leader, Col. Michael Randrianirina, that he had an order from the High Constitutional Court legitimizing his seizure of power, this seemed to be contradicted by statements a day earlier that Randrianirina’s military council had suspended the high court’s powers. That’s not to say that every political event that smells like a coup is, in fact, a coup. Many coup plots never come to fruition. A bona fide plot may be preempted and the plotters arrested, or plotters may abandon their plan before taking any concrete action. Moreover, sometimes a leader falsely alleges a coup plot to purge members of the government suspected of disloyalty. A plot without an attempt to oust the leader is not, in our book, a coup. Conversely, attempts to target a leader without a plan to seize power are not coups. This includes leader assassination attempts by political opponents or lone wolves or mutinies by disgruntled soldiers who might even march on the presidential palace to demand higher pay, promotions or other policy concessions. Nor do most civilian-led mass uprisings entail coups, even if they are successful in toppling the government. Take Nepal, where in September a Gen Z-led protest turned violent and ousted the government. But there was no coup insofar as the military remained quartered rather than actively joining the protests or issuing a threat to compel the prime minister to resign. However, some revolutions and coups do co-occur, resulting in a “ coupvolution ” or “ endgame coup .” Determining whether a coup accompanies anti-government protests depends on how elites and the military behave, not on how violent protesters may be. In Madagascar, mostly peaceful civilian protests turned into a coup attempt once troops actively joined the demonstrations. That attempt succeeded when Randrianirina , commander of the elite CAPSAT force, claimed the interim presidency and insisted a military council would rule for the time being. Why do coups succeed? There have been 601 coup attempts since 1946 , according to our database, with 299 being successful – or about 50%. In Africa during that period, 111 out of 225 coup attempts were successful. Coups come in a variety of forms, with different causes and outcomes , and not all are equally likely to succeed. The events in Madagascar, however, tick many of the boxes associated with determining coup success. Coups depend on coordinating a lot of people, while simultaneously preventing the leader from finding out about the plot. Mass protests of the kind that rocked Madagascar in recent weeks provide cover – as well as motive and opportunity – for coup plotters. Counterintuitively, military force is rarely decisive. In a typical coup attempt, much of the military remains neutral, biding its time to see whether the leader or coupists will prevail. Consequently, the perceived momentum of events influences how the military rank and file react: If they think the coupmakers will succeed, they typically join; if they think the coup will fail, they generally oppose it. A coup’s momentum depends on a variety of factors, including the identity, location and strategy of coup leaders , as well as domestic and international reactions to the coup. Coups that are launched by government insiders and senior military officers in the capital and are nonviolent and result in pro-coup mass mobilization are the most likely to succeed. By contrast, coups that are launched by government outsiders and junior officers outside the capital and are bloody and generate fierce anti-coup mass mobilization are the most likely to fail. Coup violence is inversely correlated with success. When no force is threatened – usually because the security forces remain united under a senior command – coups succeed 85% of the time. By contrast, less than 40% of coups that escalate into civil-war levels of violence – that is, resulting in over 1,000 fatalities – succeed. In Madagascar, we saw the involvement of government elites and senior officers in the capital, mass pro-coup mobilization, low levels of coup violence and a history of prior successful coups – all of which make coup success likely. Coup supporters cheer police officers in Gabon in August 2023. AP Photo/Betiness Mackosso Madagascar is not alone Since 2020, military actors have also taken power in coups in Burkina Faso, Chad, Gabon, Guinea, Mali, Niger and Sudan. So why are so many African countries prone to falling into a coup trap? Scholars have asked this question for decades. Development economist Paul Collier suggests that Africa is the most coup-prone region because it is the poorest region of the world, and it is poverty and low growth – and associated political violence – that drive coups. Others have pointed to high levels of ethnic diversity, and a history of ethnic exclusion and ethnic militaries , as long-standing drivers of coups on the continent. But since 2020, a number of other factors also appear to be driving up structural coup risk on the continent. Many African countries have seen declining trust in public institutions and leaders and a rise of terrorist violence , which have generated mass popularity for recent coups on the continent. Anti-coup norms have also weakened in recent years . International pressure to restore civilian rule was quite strong in the 1990s and 2000s, contributing to the decline of African military coups . But new post-coup African governments appear more resilient to sanctions, are cooperating more with each other and are able to draw on the support of authoritarian “ patrons ,” notably Russia and China. As a result, African post-coup governments are staying in power longer, which in turn emboldens coup plotters elsewhere who see a more permissive environment. So even if there are limits to Africa’s “coup contagion,” Madagascar likely won’t be the last domino to fall, given structural conditions on the continent.",https://theconversation.com/madagascars-military-power-grab-shows-africas-coup-problem-isnt-restricted-to-the-sahel-region-267581,Society,theconversation.com,John Joseph Chin,https://images.theconversation.com/files/696719/original/file-20251016-56-e2j7cl.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&rect=0%2C35%2C1024%2C512&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop,2025-10-16T13:43:26+00:00,c22946d53ae63e0dba4fc8cc9d3993f9f61fa996
b4920a88f508,Antarctica is starting to look a lot like Greenland—and that isn’t good,,"“We thought it was just going to take ages for any kind of climate impacts to be seen in Antarctica. And that’s really not true,” said Mottram, adding that some of the earliest warnings came from scientists who saw collapsing ice shelves, retreating glaciers, and increased surface melting in satellite data. One of the early warning signs was the rapid collapse of an ice shelf along the narrow Antarctic Peninsula, which extends northward toward the tip of South America, said Helen Amanda Fricker , a geophysics professor with the Scripps Institute of Oceanography Polar Center at the University of California, San Diego. Stranded remnants of sea ice along the Antarctic Peninsula are a reminder that much of the ice on the frozen continent around the South Pole is just as vulnerable to global warming as Arctic ice, where a long-term meltdown is well underway.

          Bob Berwyn/Inside Climate News After a string of record-warm summers riddled the floating Rhode Island-sized slab of ice with cracks and meltwater ponds, it crumbled almost overnight. The thick, ancient ice dam was gone, and the seven major outlet glaciers behind it accelerated toward the ocean, raising sea levels as their ice melted. “The Larsen B ice shelf collapse in 2002 was a staggering event in our community,” said Fricker, who was not an author of the new paper. “We just couldn’t believe the pace at which it happened, within six weeks. Basically, the ice shelves are there and then, boom, boom, boom, a series of melt streams and melt ponds. And then the whole thing collapsed, smattered into smithereens.” Glaciologists never thought that events would happen that quickly in Antarctica, she said. Same physics, same changes Fricker said glaciologists thought of changes in Antarctica on millennial timescales, but the ice shelf collapse showed that extreme warming can lead to much more rapid change. Current research focuses on the edges of Antarctica, where floating sea ice and relatively narrow outlet glaciers slow the flow of the ice cap toward the sea.

1cbc9f81518d,What to know about Trump’s threat to take World Cup games from Boston,"news, sport, football, world cup, united states, us & canada","United States President Donald Trump has threatened to relocate FIFA World Cup 2026 matches set to be played next year in suburban Boston, after suggesting that parts of the city had been “taken over” by unrest. Foxborough, Massachusetts, home to the NFL’s New England Patriots and about 48km (30 miles) from Boston, is set to stage matches as the US cohosts the 2026 World Cup with Mexico and Canada. Trump was asked about Boston’s Mayor Michelle Wu, a Democrat whom he called “intelligent” but “radical left”. Recommended Stories list of 4 items end of list “We could take them away,” Trump said of the World Cup games. “I love the people of Boston, and I know the games are sold out. But your mayor is not good.” Trump has previously made similar threats against San Francisco and Seattle. He repeated his Boston threats on Wednesday. Can Trump take away the FIFA World Cup 2026 games? Trump has previously suggested he could declare cities “not safe” for the 104-game football tournament and alter a detailed hosting plan that FIFA confirmed in 2022. It includes games at NFL stadiums near New York, Los Angeles and San Francisco. World Cup host sites aren’t up to Trump. The 11 US cities — plus three in Mexico and two in Canada — are contracted with FIFA, which would face significant logistical and legal issues to make changes in the eight months before the June 11 kickoff. “It’s FIFA’s tournament, FIFA’s jurisdiction, FIFA makes those decisions,” the football body’s vice president Victor Montagliani said earlier this month at a sports business conference in London. The organisation seemed to soften its stance somewhat on Wednesday, saying in a statement that “safety and security are the top priorities at all FIFA events worldwide” and noting that precautions are “obviously the governments’ responsibility, and they decide what is in the best interest for public safety”. “We hope every one of our 16 Host Cities will be ready to successfully host and fulfil all necessary requirements,” the FIFA statement added. Trump has insisted that “if somebody is doing a bad job, and if I feel there’s unsafe conditions, I would call Gianni – the head of FIFA who’s phenomenal – and I would say, ‘Let’s move into another location’, and they would do that.” The president meant FIFA head Gianni Infantino, a close ally. Trump said Infantino “wouldn’t love to do it, but he’d do it very easily”. Speaking on a local podcast on Wednesday, Wu questioned how Trump could take away the games with less than a year to go. She said most everything is already “locked down by contract” so no single person “even if they live in the White House currently can undo it”. “There’s no ability to take away the World Cup games,” Wu said. “There’s no real threat when it comes to saying cities are so unsafe that they can’t host the games.” The FIFA World Cup 2026 games in Boston Among the seven matches that will be played at Gillette Stadium in the Boston suburb of Foxborough will be five group stage matches, one match in the round of 32, and a quarterfinal match on July 9, 2026. The news of so many big games was a surprise to local organisers. “The later in the tournament, the more eyeballs,” said Mike Loynd, head of Boston’s World Cup organising committee, when the schedule was announced last year. “For us, it’s just a matter of excitement. … For us, it’s a perfect schedule. I don’t think FIFA could have done a better job.” The tournament is expected to bring $1.1bn in local economic impact, create over 5,000 jobs, and generate more than $60m of tax revenue throughout the region, according to organisers. They also expect that more than two million visitors will come to New England throughout the tournament’s 39-day span. What is Robert Kraft’s connection with Trump? Gillette Stadium is operated by Robert Kraft, who owns the NFL’s New England Patriots and Major League Soccer’s New England Revolution. Kraft served as honorary chair of the United Bid Committee to help bring the World Cup back to the US. In a 2024 interview on the podcast The Breakfast Club, he described himself as a “social friend” of Trump beginning in the 1990s shortly after he purchased the Patriots. He said in that interview that the only donation he’d ever made to Trump was a “strong donation to his inauguration” following his 2016 election. But Kraft also gifted the president a diamond-encrusted Super Bowl ring during his first term after the Patriots won the NFL’s championship to cap the 2016 season. Sitting presidents typically receive gifts from sports teams during celebratory White House visits — a personalised jersey is standard — but Kraft gave Trump a ring as well, the team confirmed at the time. Kraft decided after the team’s April 2017 visit to have a ring made for Trump so he would have something special to display in his presidential library, the team said. But Kraft said in that same 2024 Breakfast Club interview that he hadn’t spoken to Trump since the January 6, 2021 attack by Trump supporters on the US Capitol. Trump takes aim at Boston Boston and its mayor have been frequent targets of the Trump administration for much of the year. Trump and his allies have focused their attacks on the city’s so-called sanctuary city polices and how much police should support deportations. In September, the Trump administration sued the city, arguing its sanctuary city policies are illegal under federal law and the city’s refusal to cooperate with immigration authorities has resulted in the release of dangerous criminals who should be deported. The Trump administration has already deployed US National Guard troops to Washington and Memphis, and efforts to do so in Chicago and Portland, Oregon, have sparked legal fights. Democratic and Republican leaders across Massachusetts have pushed back against the National Guard deployment in Boston, and Wu, who is running unopposed for re-election, often cites the city’s historical low crime rates. Wu touts the fact that gun violence fell to the lowest level on record in her first year in office and has continued to decline. Boston saw a historical low number of homicides in 2024, a total 24 — but the city has surpassed that number so far in 2025 with 27, the police department said.",https://www.aljazeera.com/sports/2025/10/16/what-to-know-about-trumps-threat-to-take-world-cup-games-from-boston,World,aljazeera.com,"News Agencies,Kevin Hand",https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2025-08-22T183124Z_545033972_RC2ICGAD3ZWO_RTRMADP_3_USA-TRUMP-1760625643.jpg?resize=1920%2C1440,,aebc7f42a40eda1096979cc6c31f2dd01e4e7e53

8d62471eb282,How to Use Satellite Communications on the Garmin Fenix 8 Pro,"gps, wearables, shopping, accessories and peripherals, gadgets, outdoors, fitness trackers","If I’ve learned one thing from listening to the entire back catalog of the excellent podcast Real Survival Stories , it’s this: Whether you’re mountain biking Californian trails or kayaking the west coast of England, the proverbial, you know, can hit the fan really fast. When an adventure flips unexpectedly into an emergency situation, the one thing you definitely want is a way to summon rescue, even when you're far from cell networks. Until now, tapping into off-grid comms meant carrying a dedicated satellite messenger . But alongside competitors like Google and Apple , Garmin—makers of the best outdoor sports watches —have made it possible to have satellite safety back up strapped to your wrist 24/7. The new Garmin Fenix 8 Pro now packs Garmin’s inReach satellite communication smarts, including satellite-powered text messaging, location check-ins and Emergency SOS–a virtual flare that hails assistance via Garmin Response. Here's how to use it. Jump to Section AccordionItemContainerButton What You Pay For First off, you must know that the new Fenix 8 Pro is $200 more than the original Fenix 8. You also need an inReach subscription plan , which starts from $8 per month and rises to $50 per month for the top tier. Picking the right plan depends on how many messages you want to send and how much you plan to use the live tracking. All inReach packages include the Emergency SOS and LTE services and require a 30-day commitment. Monthly subscriptions are available, and if your tracking or communication needs change, you can also move up or down tiers. For situations when you’re without your phone still have network coverage, there’s also phone-free LTE calls, voice messages, test messages, and live tracking. How to Set Up Satellite Comms From setup to send, I put the new satellite and LTE tools to the test using the Fenix 8 Pro 51-millimeter AMOLED. You need: The Garmin Fenix 8 Pro A smartphone with Garmin Connect and Garmin Messenger apps installed A Garmin account (that you sign into on your phone and watch) A Garmin Messenger account, linked to your phone number An inReach/satellite service plan–a free trial can be activated during setup The initial setup is a bit of a faff, involving multiple Garmin apps, creating an account within Garmin’s inReach platform, and lastly, deciphering which subs package you need. Still, the whole process took about 15 minutes and can be done on your phone and the watch. You'll consider that time well invested if you find yourself stuck in a ravine, being circled by predators, in need of help.",https://www.wired.com/story/how-to-use-satcomms-garmin-fenix-8-pro,Technology,wired.com,Kieran Alger,"https://media.wired.com/photos/68f07dd9cf9bcb735c2fc86a/191:100/w_1280,c_limit/How%20to%20Use%20Satellite%20Communications%20on%20the%20Garmin%20Fenix%208%20Pro.png",2025-10-16T15:00:00+00:00,ad5e840456098bdfd090af2ea84a59660ba8ee44
5699a1869cb2,The Best Cat Toys,"shopping, cats, pets, buying guides","Cats are beautiful, interesting, weird creatures. They're also very picky. Finding cat toys that they'll actually play with is tough, especially with the sheer oversaturation of the pet market today. Cats require a specific environment to play, scratch, and relax. Based on years of testing with our cats, these are our favorite WIRED-approved, techy cat toys (and furniture ). Even if our cats rejected a particular product, we still examined overall construction, design, and value to determine whether it may be useful for other kitties. We have tested everything on this list with our own cats. All of these toys have an element to engage their natural instincts, like an interactive mat that mimics the movements of prey, or a puzzle toy so your cat has to use their pecan-sized brain to get rewarded with delicious treats. Plus, increasing vertical space with cat furniture is a great way to provide passive enrichment. I'm a helicopter cat mom specializing in pet tech, and all of the cat toys and furniture in this guide are approved by both my and other staffers' (very spoiled) WIRED cats. Check out our related guides like the Best Automatic Cat Litter Boxes , Best Automatic Cat Feeders , Best Cat Water Fountains , and Our Favorite Fancy Cat Furniture . More of a dog person?

Jump to Section AccordionItemContainerButton Updated October 2025: We've added The Purrgola, Mau Reiya, and Mau Ivy 3, and removed the 5Strands Intolerances & Imbalances Test. We've updated prices and links throughout. Cat Toys Photograph: Molly Higgins Sofolor Interactive Cat Toy This feline crowd pleaser is the cat toy I recommend everyone buy. My extremely spoiled cats rarely interact with a toy for more than five minutes, but they play with this interactive cat toy for hours on end. It has three modes so cats never get bored: Normal, Active, and Interactive, and it shuts off automatically after a period of time not being used. It has a simple USB charger (but lasts on a charge for about six days), and a button that controls everything, plus it comes with a replacement wand in case your cats are as rough-and-tumble as mine. Although this is a bit more than I like to spend on cat toys, it was the best purchase I've made this year. Photograph: Molly Higgins Viwik Interactive Cat Toy Mat My cats go bonkers for interactive play mats, and although this one didn't keep their attention as much as the play mat above, it's still a solid choice and provides them with options when it comes to human-free play. The rechargeable rolling ball lights up and moves erratically inside the mat, which held my cats' attention for probably half an hour. I put this one away for a few days before bringing it back out to keep interest. You can even use the rolling ball as a toy outside the mat, but beware that it easily rolls under furniture and in hard-to-reach corners. My biggest gripe is that the rechargeable ball has a short battery life and needs to be charged after each play session. Photograph: Molly Higgins Valonii Motion Activated Cat Laser Toy There's some controversy in the cat-owning community about whether lasers are too frustrating for cats, who may feel like they can never “catch” the “prey” (aka pouncing on the laser dot without actually being able to get it). My cats are both obsessed with laser toys, and it's a great way for them to get exercise and keep themselves entertained; I just always give them treats after to reward them for a job well done. This toy has three interactive modes and motion sensor activation to further keep cats' attention, and it lasts about a day before needing to be recharged. Photograph: Molly Higgins Catstages Interactive Cat Treat Puzzle One of my cats is an extremely intelligent, high-energy cat who's also very food motivated, so it is a continual challenge to find things to keep him entertained—not to mention, I also have to make sure he doesn't inhale his food. With this toy, you can cover up the treats with the leaves or put them only in the cups for an extra challenge—I love that this puzzle toy is totally customizable based on your cat’s intelligence level. I have both the Melon Madness and Buggin’ Out models, and even years later, my cats are still entertained by them. I call that a good investment. If you can't figure out which kind of toy your cats will like, or you just want them to be refreshed every so often, Meowbox is a great subscription. You can choose to get deliveries every one or two months, and they include both treats and incredibly cute toys with an equally cute theme. Plus, for every box sold, the company gives food to a shelter. Snuggly Cat The Ripple Rug Former WIRED reviewer Medea Giordano 's cats went nuts for this Ripple Rug. The bottom piece stays in place while the top can be configured into different shapes for playing (or hunting), and you can reshape it as often as you wish. The material feels like felt, but is made from 24 post-consumer plastic bottles and can withstand sharp claws. All three of our cats love the Kong Kickeroo, and it has been one of the most long-lived cat toys we have ever bought. Bodhi is our eldest cat and rarely plays with toys anymore, but even he can’t resist the Kickeroo. It’s the perfect shape to grab and claw at with his back paws, and it has a tail, mixed textures, and crinkly material inside with a touch of catnip. We also tried the smaller model, but it was quickly chewed through, while the larger one has lasted for years. — Simon Hill Bawan Silvervine Chew Sticks My overactive cat Basil is one of roughly 40 percent of cats that don't react to catnip, which is a bummer because he gets FOMO watching his sister go wild. Luckily, both of my cats go crazy for these simple sticks. It helps them engage with natural kicking instincts and redirects aggressive chewing from my iPhone cord. I'd recommend that anyone with cats who don't react to catnip or have aggressive chewing tendencies give these a try. I’ve had seven cats over the past 20 years, and every single one of them has been obsessed with this interactive toy. And not just any wand toy, this one specifically and its original feather attachment, which uses the same swivel mechanism as a fishing lure to create movement through the air that registers as 100 percent authentic to cats. There are other attachments available, like fur “mice,” but nothing hits quite like the original feather cluster. Make sure you stock up on refills , in case your cat finds the wand in the middle of the night and has its way with it. (Speaking from experience.) — Kat Merck Photograph: Molly Higgins This pet camera has the ability to control a laser via app, so you can engage in play with your cat even when away, and it aims to auto-engage when motion is detected (but very often it didn't). Although I wish the motion sensors were a bit more sensitive to engage in play more often while I'm not home, it consistently kept my cats entertained, plus it was fun to be able to play with them through the app from afar. Photograph: Molly Higgins Enabot Rola PetPal Robot Pet Companion Is it a toy? Is it a security camera ? Is it a treat dispenser? There's no need to decide! While my cats were more curious than excited to play with this li'l robot pet camera , it did keep their attention, which is a win in my book. My cat Basil was obsessed with the toy attachment and loved finding different ways to proudly pull it off and bring it to me. The app can be a bit glitchy, and the robot is by no means smart, but it is a camera you can move about your house while you're away, and it'll roll, slam into objects, and shoot treats out at your confused cats. At the end of the day, the robot was great at keeping their attention, which is all we really want in the end. Cat Trees and Furniture Omlet Freestyle Indoor Cat Tree More than just a cat tree, the modular Freestyle lets you customize your own indoor or outdoor cat jungle gym from a series of bamboo platforms, beds, ramps, hammocks, and scratchers. The platforms are sturdy enough to support cats of any size or activity level, and the poles can accommodate ceilings up to 14 feet. The system is not inexpensive or especially easy to put together, but my cats Circe and Scylla spend every single day on theirs, making it worth the investment. — Kat Merck This is one of the most popular items I have ever tested with my cats. Neighbors love it, delivery people comment on it, and, of course, both my cats adore it. It’s super easy to assemble and install, provided you have a vertical sash window—just close the window on it, and raised acrylic stakes in the back will keep it in place. (You also have the option to screw the Purrgola to the window frame, which is recommended, and/or secure the window in place with window locks .) The thick, weatherproof acrylic—which is seriously thick; it even survived a tumble out of a first-story window during our test—is load-tested to 90 pounds, and the cushion inside has a soft, minky, machine-washable cover. The screens on either side are stainless-steel mesh to prevent any funny business. It’s got an acrylic door on the room side that pulls out and down to close, but this part is fragile; I’ve now broken it twice taking it in and out of the window, but it glues back just fine. I wouldn’t recommend using a Purrgola during a very rainy season, as a little heavy rain will come in the side screens (though not a lot!), or where there are lots of bugs, as it’s not an airtight fit in the window. However, if your cats are indoor-only ( and they should be !), this is a fun and stylish way for them to interact safely with the outdoors. Also note that it may take cats a while to get used to it—it took both of mine about a week, but after that, they were both in it every day. — Kat Merck No one does high-end cat furniture quite like Mau. WIRED has tested several of Mau’s cat trees over the years, and every one has been a banger: objectively beautiful, sturdy, well-made, and beloved by cats. The solid-oak Reiya isn’t one of Mau’s flashier designs, and in fact, I’m surprised by how unassuming it looks online—in person, it reads as a midcentury work of art, Hans Wegner -esque with rounded edges and a glowing oak finish. Everyone who visits our house has commented on it. I admit I was a little worried about the baskets being clawed or unraveled, but they’re plastic rattan. The woolly Oeko-Tex cushion covers zip off for washing, and for younger, more playful kitties, there are rings on the underside of the top platform for dangling white, green, or pink optional pom poms ($12) . The scratching pad is the hard kind of sisal material, which my cats don’t love, but they quickly warmed up to it with some training. In any case, a Mau cat tree is an investment, but you get what you pay for, and this is likely the last cat tree you will need to buy in your lifetime. If you’re not sure, Mau offers a 45-day trial period and one-year warranty. — Kat Merck Photograph: Molly Higgins It's pretty clear that the WIRED reviews team loves Mau furniture. It's sleek, well-made, and looks like a high-end piece of furniture rather than the ugly, cheaply-made cat trees of yesteryear. This piece is solid: with a heavy wood base, two sturdy sisal-rope lined trunk pieces that screw together, three woven baskets that screw in to place, and three super-soft fur pillows. Plus, all of of the pieces are replaceable, so that if something succumbs to wear and tear over time, you won't have to throw away the entire tree. The fur cushions are machine washable too, but make sure you read the cleaning directions to ensure they last as long as possible. Mau has free shipping (in the contiguous USA and Canada), a 45-day return policy, and a one-year warranty. My cats use this tree every day, and I'm happy to have this stylish piece proudly on display in my living room. Cats like to jump and climb whatever they can, so a cat tree should help keep them occupied and off your mantel or breakable glassware. Our favorite cat trees are made from materials that can be scratched up. (We also have a guide to the fanciest cat furniture we've tried if you really want the full scoop.) When you live in a small apartment, everything you decorate with matters because it's all on display—nothing gets hidden when you only have one to three rooms. Some of us want our cat's furniture to match, too. Mau's Cento is one of former WIRED reviewer Medea Giordano 's favorites. If you can afford it, your cats will thank you. Mau Kona End Table Scratcher Mau is known for its high-end and tasteful cat furniture (including our Mau picks above), and its Kona side table fits right into the lineup with a midcentury mod vibe and scratching pad discreetly tucked into the back. The solid-wood table is very heavy and well-made, with options for an oak or walnut finish. It didn’t dissuade my cats from scratching the chair it’s next to, but it does come with a bag of catnip to help with encouragement. This table is popular and often sold out, but you can sign up on Mau’s website to be notified of the next restock. — Kat Merck Photograph: Medea Giordano K&H Pet Products Kitty Sill Cat Window Perch Our favorite window perch lets cats responsibly interact with the outside world. Former WIRED reviewer Medea Giordano loved these window seats because they are a great way for cats to bask in the sun and keep a watchful eye on the neighborhood while safely indoors. They're easy to install too, with sticky strips that attach to your windowsill that can hold up to 40 pounds. You can also nail the base into the window frame, and there are even heated seats for super-spoiled kitties. The covers are removable and can be machine-washed. Heads up, you'll need a windowsill at least 2 inches deep to properly support it. Photograph: Molly Higgins This cat bed has a memory foam sculpted-contour mattress base with a super cozy (removable and washable) nano heating and volcanic-particle-infused cover. It has a button on the side with different heat settings, including timed heatings. It has optional self-heating natural herb pad attachments for further pain relief and to help reduce arthritic inflammation, which is especially ideal for senior cats. The sculpted bed is specially contoured to provide orthopedic support for the cat's joints. Pro tip : Put the bed on a higher surface or somewhere the cats already lounge. Cats love to be off the ground, and once I moved this on top of my side desk, both of my cats lay in it constantly. Photograph: Molly Higgins I've been getting Instagram ads for this stylish bed that attaches to your desk for so long, I had to cave and see if it was worth the hype. Especially since I have a very needy cat who loves to lounge on my laptop while I WFH. This bed is easy to assemble, with an arm that screws into the wooden base and a screwed vise to keep the bed in place on the desk. It has adjustable vertical height, and the base also rotates. Just make sure you measure the surface you want to attach it to before you buy. My desk was too thick, and my side table was too thin—luckily they sent additional planks to add into the screwed vise to make it sturdier, but I haven't found the purrfect spot for it yet. Other Essentials We Keep Going Back To Photograph: Molly Higgins Yeowww! Banana Catnip Toy for $6: This toy has been the single most loved toy by all of former WIRED reviewer Medea Giordano 's cats. Playology Feather Mice for $17 : Did you know there are “bird” cats and “mouse” cats? Most cats actually prefer to hunt specific types of prey , and I’ve seen this play out in my own house. Even though they’re litter mates, one of my indoor cats clearly prefers to leap at flying things (birds) and the other likes to hide and leap out at things down low (mice). They both enjoy these toys—they’re fuzzy like mice but feathered like birds, with some catnip for added interest. I recommend putting them away when playtime is finished to keep interest fresh, and to remove the bell if you don’t want to hear jingling in the middle of the night. — Kat Merck Cat Dancer Interactive Cat Toy for $4 : This absurdly simple toy is a cheap crowd pleaser. It's just some rolls of cardboard that weigh down a springy steel wire. The erratic movements are similar to bugs flying, and my cats always actively play with it. Lick Mat for $8 : A lick mat is a great way to add enrichment and stimulation—plus, it helps them promote slow eating (and less throwing up). I also have this set of two cute fish-shaped lick mats ($17) for each of my kitties, and it's a fun way to give them a treat while promoting slow feeding and stimulation. I put Churu puree with some added water to help sneakily add more hydration to their snacks.",https://www.wired.com/story/best-cat-toys,Technology,wired.com,Molly Higgins,"https://media.wired.com/photos/68effea60e5a5eb21018ff93/191:100/w_1280,c_limit/The%20Best%20Cat%20Toys.png",2024-04-11T13:30:00+00:00,4f3deeb2902c1428fc1a5585c7dc0fd0d4aea2c0
868cdef232cb,"Black eyes, orbital fractures and retinal detachment: Pickleball-related eye injuries are on the rise in the US",,"Eye injuries related to pickleball have increased at an ""alarming rate"" as the sport's popularity has exploded in the United States, a new study finds. More and more people in the U.S. are taking up pickleball as a leisure activity, with recent estimates suggesting that 19.8 million people participated in the sport in 2024, up about 45% from 2023 and 311% from 2020. Now, in a study published Thursday (Oct. 16) in the journal JAMA Ophthalmology , three eye doctors found that this uptick in people playing the paddle sport has triggered a rise in related eye injuries. For this study, they turned to the National Electronic Injury Surveillance System (NEISS), a government-funded database that documents consumer product-related injuries. NEISS primarily gathers its data from samplings of about 100 hospitals with emergency departments (EDs), which are selected as a representative snapshot of the more than 5,000 U.S. hospitals with EDs. The team focused on data gathered between the start of 2005 and the end of 2024. The search turned up a total of 2,472 pickleball-related injuries to any part of the body, including 73 eye injuries. Those numbers suggest that there were about 137,470 total injuries and 3,110 eye injuries nationwide across that timeframe. Notably, no pickleball-related eye injuries were reported prior to 2014, and 88% of the eye injuries reported took place between 2022 and 2024. The results suggest the rate of eye injuries increased by about 405 cases per year from 2021 to 2024, the authors calculated. About 70% of all the eye injuries were reported in players ages 50 years or older, which may hint that older age groups are more vulnerable to these types of injuries due to changes in muscle mass, bone density or balance, the researchers speculated. Get the world’s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox. In cases where the cause of injury was known, the most common mechanism was getting hit with the ball, followed by falling or getting hit with a paddle. Periocular lacerations — cuts to the area immediately around the eyeball — made up the highest proportion of reported injuries. Other minor injuries included scratches to the cornea, the clear window at the front of the eye; inflammation to the iris, the colored part of the eye; and periocular contusions, better known as black eyes. More serious injuries that could threaten a person's eyesight included hyphema, where blood pools in front of the eye; orbital fracture; retinal detachment; and globe trauma, in which the wall of the eyeball is ruptured, typically by blunt force. The study authors noted that recent surveys suggest the uptick in pickleball participation is being driven by an ""influx of casual players,"" as opposed to ""core players"" who play more than eight times a year. ""Although the increase in ocular injuries may simply reflect the increasing number of players, it is also possible that casual players are more susceptible to injury due to limited experience, unfamiliarity with the game, or lower level of physical fitness,"" the researchers suggested. But more data are needed to confirm that suspicion, they said in their report. Notably, because the NEISS data are pulled from just a sample of EDs, they may not be completely representative of the nation as a whole, the authors added. The study also didn't capture patients who may have sought care at outpatient clinics, rather than the ED. But nonetheless, the data point to a potentially ""alarming"" trend, the researchers concluded. ""Currently, no official guidelines exist regarding eye protection in pickleball,"" they added. The American Academy of Ophthalmology recommends that pickleball players wear protective eye gear during games, but this precaution is not mandated or promoted by pickleball organizations, the study authors noted. ""Increasing awareness for age-specific risk factors and establishing standardized recommendations for eye protection may help reduce injury rates and prevent vision loss,"" they wrote.

619c9c1bb23b,Record-breaking 'dark object' found hiding within a warped 'Einstein ring' 10 billion light-years away,,"Astronomers have discovered a surprisingly small ""dark object"" lurking within a distant ring of warped light. The record-breaking find could help shed light on the mysterious identity of dark matter, which would have major implications for the field of cosmology . The hidden object, likely a clump of invisible dark matter, was spotted within B1938+666 — an ""Einstein ring"" located around 10 billion light-years from Earth. This luminous halo (which appears dark in the black-and-white images) is made up of light from a distant galaxy that has been bent around a closer foreground galaxy (the dark dot at the center of the ring). This is an effect of gravitational lensing , a phenomenon that was first proposed by Albert Einstein's theory of general relativity in 1915. Gravitational lensing not only warps light but also significantly magnifies it. When the lensing object is perfectly aligned between the distant object and the observer, the light bends into a circle around the foreground object, known as an Einstein ring . However, an imperfect alignment can also create other strange shapes, such as crosses , zig-zags and question marks , and duplicate individual points of light within the same image . B1938+666 was discovered in the 1990s. But in a pair of new studies, published Oct. 9 in the journals Nature Astronomy and Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society , researchers took a closer look at the gravitationally lensed object and found a subtle wobble within a prominent arc of radio waves in the outer ring (colored red and yellow in the image). They quickly realized this was a gravitational disturbance caused by a hidden object. ""From the first high-resolution image, we immediately observed a narrowing in the gravitational arc, which is the tell-tale sign that we were onto something,"" John McKean , an astronomer at the University of Groningen in the Netherlands and the University of Pretoria in South Africa, and co-author on both new studies, said in a statement . ""Only another small clump of mass between us and the distant radio galaxy could cause this."" The researchers were able to detect a subtle gravitational disturbance within the Einstein ring by studying the object with multiple radio telescopes. (Image credit: Keck/EVN/GBT/VLBA) The object is around 1 million times more massive than the sun, which sounds like a lot. However, this actually makes it around 100 times smaller than the previous record-holder for the least-massive object ever detected via gravitational lensing. The study teams uncovered this object by combining data from radio observatories located across the globe, including the Green Bank Telescope in West Virginia, the Very Long Baseline Array in New Mexico and the European Very Long Baseline Interferometry Network. This enabled the researchers to achieve the equivalent observing power of an Earth-size telescope, which helped them to detect such a subtle fluctuation in the data. But there was so much information that the researchers had to come up with a new way of sorting it. Get the world’s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox. ""The data are so large and complex that we had to develop new numerical approaches to model them,"" Simona Vegetti , an astronomer at the Max Planck Institute for Astrophysics in Germany and co-author on both new studies, said in the statement. ""This was not straightforward as it had never been done before."" While they cannot be certain, the researchers are confident that the new object is a small clump of dark matter — the invisible matter that makes up 27% of the known universe and does not interact with light. This is unsurprising, given that gravitational lensing is one of the only ways we can detect and measure dark matter, making Einstein rings and other warped objects one of our greatest weapons in unmasking its true identity . B1938+666 was first discovered in the 1990s. These initial photos of the Einstein ring were taken by the Hubble Space Telescope (left) and the Pan-STARRS survey (right). (Image credit: Left: NASA/HST/NICMOS, Right: Pan-STARRS/F160W) Finding isolated dark matter clumps like this is especially useful for testing the ""cold dark matter theory,"" which posits that dark matter can only clump together if it moves at relatively slow speeds, meaning it would give off relatively low amounts of energy, Live Science's sister site Space.com reported . And the researchers predict that these clumps are far more common than we currently realize.

Sleek, durable and app-connected, it is one of the handful of models available on the market that offer a whopping seven brushing modes and AI-powered brushing guidance. This smart gem can actively help take your dental care routine to the next level, and that is not something that many toothbrushes can do. We were delighted to see it drop to the lowest-ever price during the last Prime Day sale, but if you missed your chance to save back then, do not despair — this electric toothbrush is now back on sale. The Oral-B iO Series 9 in black onyx color is now a massive 30% off at Best Buy , saving you a round $100. If you want to save an additional four cents, you can also get this model at Walmart . It may not be the most affordable model out there, but it is worth it. We gave this electric toothbrush a strong four-star rating in our full Oral-B iO Series 9 review , and we only knocked off that one remaining star due to its high price at the time of testing. Now that it costs just $229.99, this drawback is no longer there. Anna Gora Health writer and reviewer Image 1 of 3 The Oral-B iO Series 9 is one of our all-time favorite smart-enabled electric toothbrushes. (Image credit: Mina Frost) (Image credit: Mina Frost) (Image credit: Mina Frost) For almost two years, the Oral-B iO Series 9 firmly held the title of the best option for smart features in our guide to the best electric toothbrushes . Admittedly, we had to concede its prized spot the moment we tried the even more premium iO Series 10 . Still, it remains one of our all-time favorite smart devices. What we liked most about this electric toothbrush is that it can act like your own pocket-sized dental hygienist. The Oral-B iO Series 9 does a fabulous job of tracking your brushing movements and dental care habits, then using artificial intelligence to analyse the collected data and come up with helpful tips on how best to improve your brushing technique. This feature can be particularly useful for those with complex dental needs or individuals who struggle with establishing an effective dental care routine.

Key features: AI-driven brushing guidance, pressure sensor, light-up pressure ring, four color options, seven cleaning modes, charging travel case, three spare heads Product launched: August 2020 Price history: Before today's deal, the lowest price on the Oral-B iO Series 9 was $180.95, and for the better part of this year, the price fluctuated between $239.99 and $299.99. Today's offer from Best Buy brings the price down to $229.99, which is the lowest we have seen since the Prime Day in October sale. Price comparison: Amazon: $249.95 | Walmart: $229.95 | Best Buy : $229.99 Reviews consensus: Universally praised as one of the best smart-enabled electric toothbrushes on the market, the Oral-B iO Series 9 has impressed reviewers across the board with its superb brushing performance, AI-powered brushing guidance and sensitive pressure sensor. That said, most testers also complained about its relatively high price, and some reviewers were disappointed with its smart features and a hard-to-clean design.

18736c987d3e,Has Justin Fields been 'too conservative'? Jets QB says he needs to start 'letting it rip' after 0-6 start,"justin fields, new york jets","The New York Jets made a splash in free agency this past offseason when the franchise signed quarterback Justin Fields to a two-year, $40 million contract. However, Fields hasn't proved to be the offensive weapon that the team envisioned as he's thrown just four touchdown passes in six games. As a result, Fields feels he needs to be more aggressive going forward if the Jets want to be successful on the offensive side of the ball. ""I feel like I've been a little bit too conservative in a sense, "" Fields said, per ESPN. ""Probably just [need to] be a little bit more aggressive. I've always just been big on ball security and not putting the ball in jeopardy, but it comes to a point where you just have to find that healthy balance between trying to maybe fit it in smaller windows and just letting it rip."" Fields failed to get the ball out and down the field in a 13-11 Week 6 loss against the Denver Broncos . The former first-round pick completed just 9 of 17 passes for 45 yards and was sacked on nine different occasions. In total, the Jets finished with 10 net passing yards, which was the fewest in an NFL game since Ryan Leaf started for the San Diego Chargers back in 1998. One positive has been the fact that Fields hasn't thrown an interception in his 123 passing attempts this season. In fact, Fields is the only NFL signal-caller with at least 100 passes and zero interceptions. While Fields has taken care of the football, it hasn't resulted in much success for the Jets offense. The Jets, who possess an 0-6 record this season, are averaging just 20.5 points per game (25th in the NFL) and have scored 22 or fewer points in five of their last six contests. ""No interceptions is a great thing,"" Fields said, ""But I also think taking some shots down the field and trying to stretch the field a little bit, I think that's important for us as an offense to create explosive passes. ""Everybody is going to throw picks, that's just a part of playing quarterback,"" he continued. ""I looked at myself this past game, and really over the season, and kind of just told myself that I can be a little bit more aggressive. So this Sunday, [I'm] probably going to be a little bit more aggressive, but also not being reckless at the same time. So, it's just being smart when pushing the ball downfield."" Choosing to hold onto the ball too long has been a theme for Fields throughout the 2025 season. In fact, Fields has been sacked 19 times, which is the second-most in the league with only Tennessee Titans rookie Cam Ward being sacked more frequently. The Jets will look to land in the win column on Sunday when they host the Carolina Panthers . When Fields takes to the gridiron, he may have to do so without star wide receiver Garrett Wilson , who will likely miss the game due to a hyperextended knee .",https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/justin-fields-jets-qb-start-letting-it-rip-after-0-6-start,Sport,cbssports.com,,https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2025/10/16/6e0fb33a-fa87-477e-9ccd-69702f91df6d/thumbnail/1200x675/94058191839995c53aae8b8b5a226a3d/justin-fields-london-getty.jpg,2025-10-16T15:22:00+00:00,7bef916c67364f2617fbc0031d4a6fc39a9e1131
382fbe4b9cfb,Dwyane Wade reveals when he knew it was time to retire from the NBA: 'I didn't have that special quality',,"Dwyane Wade is one of the best basketball players of the last 25 years. In fact, he ranked 11th in our CBS Sports' top 25 players of the 21st century. He's a three-time champion, 13-time All-Star first-ballot Hall of Famer and a member of the NBA's 75th anniversary team. And that's just a small snapshot of his accolades. He's six years removed from throwing on his iconic No. 3 jersey and has since started a career as a basketball analyst, both in the podcast space and on television. As he prepares for his new gig as a member of NBA on Amazon Prime's broadcast crew, Wade shared when he knew it was time to retire. ""Once I knew that I didn't have that special quality anymore, that I lost all my powers and I became a regular basketball player, the game was not as fun as it used to be,"" Wade told GQ . Wade spent 14 years of his 16-year career operating at peak levels. Even at 35-years old, he was still averaging 18.3 points a game, something only seven other players have accomplished since 2000. But those last two seasons saw a downturn in production from one of the league's most efficient scorers when he was in his prime. The Conversation: Can the Heat reinvent themselves again after the Jimmy Butler era? James Herbert It's a situation most professional athletes go through when they're reaching their twilight years. Perhaps the only two people it hasn't impacted are LeBron James and Tom Brady, two titans who have defied father time. Brady played until he was 45 and won a Super Bowl at 43. James is about to turn 41 in December and is still operating at All-NBA levels. While James is set to miss his first season opener in his record-breaking 23rd season due to sciatica, there still isn't a more feared image for opponents than James driving full speed into the lane with the objective of finishing at the rim when healthy. Wade was once that way, too. He wasn't quite the physical specimen James is, but his quickness and athleticism made him one of the most difficult players to guard. ""When you had the career I had, you don't envy someone else's journey,"" Wade said. ""I got everything out of the game of basketball that I possibly wanted."" Wade wasn't just one of the best players in the league, he was one of the most popular, too. His talent transcended the Miami Heat fanbase, so it wasn't uncommon to see No. 3 Wade jerseys overflowing at away arenas whenever he and the Heat came to town. Fans chanting his name -- or booing him -- is a feeling that can't be replicated outside of the NBA, and while he likely doesn't miss back-to-back games, or the grind of an 82-game regular season, there is one thing the Hall of Famer misses. ""What I do miss is being better than people,"" Wade said. ""I miss being good at something, really good at it.""",https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/dwyane-wade-reveals-when-he-knew-it-was-time-to-retire-from-the-nba-i-didnt-have-that-special-quality,Sport,cbssports.com,,https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2025/10/16/5627a7cc-096d-415a-a47e-a7b98dba2aba/thumbnail/1200x675/7eef908820e434291d15d9cc1a43fccd/dwyane-wade.jpg,2025-10-16T15:20:01+00:00,630115112d5c67830c864b974bc69c54c452a88d
d1d0af9c1e53,"What's going on with Cardinals coach Jonathan Gannon? Sideline clash, Michael Vick comment raise questions","jonathan gannon, cardinals coach, arizona cardinals, michael vick comment, sideline clash, cardinals controversy, nfl week 7, gannon hot seat","Jonathan Gannon is no stranger to leaving spectators scratching their heads. Since stepping into the NFL limelight in 2023, the Arizona Cardinals head coach has had more than his share of viral moments -- from his awkward first team meeting and asking players if they drove or took the bus to the facility to smacking a broadcast camera out of his face on the sideline. But the past two weeks have elevated Gannon's reputation for unpredictability to a new level. Amid Arizona's 2-4 start, the 41-year-old coach has found himself back in the social-media crosshairs due to a string of sideline incidents and eyebrow-raising comments. Sideline altercation with Emari Demercado Things seemingly started to devolve in Week 5, when the Cardinals suffered arguably the worst loss of any team this season — blowing a 21-3 lead to the previously winless Tennessee Titans in a 22-21 defeat. The game's defining moment came when running back Emari Demercado broke loose for what should've been a 70-plus-yard touchdown, only to let go of the ball just before crossing the goal line . The ball rolled out of the end zone for a touchback, erasing the score. That led to a sideline altercation between Demercado and Gannon, where the head coach appeared to make contact with the player. The Cardinals fined Gannon $100,000 for his actions, and he publicly apologized the following day. ""Yeah, I woke up this morning and didn't feel great about it, honestly. So in the team meeting, I addressed it. I apologized to Emari, apologized to the team and I just told them I kind of let the moment of what happened get the better of me there. ""I try to be emotionally stable and calm because my job is to solve problems during a game, and kind of lead the charge on that. So it's not really who I am, who I want to be, and I told the guys that today. So it's a mistake by me, and it's just like everybody in there, everybody made some type of mistake yesterday, which culminates to why we didn't win the game, and we can't let it happen moving forward."" The very next week, Gannon was without his franchise quarterback in Kyler Murray after he was sidelined due to a foot sprain. Despite starting backup Jacoby Brissett , Arizona not only hung around with the Indianapolis Colts, but held a 24-17 lead entering the fourth quarter and a 27-24 lead in the middle of the final period as well. Yet once again, they couldn't close. The Colts rallied late for a 31-27 win, handing Arizona its fourth consecutive loss. Brissett's solid showing -- in which the Cardinals offense registered season highs in points (27) and yards (400) -- led to questions about a potential quarterback controversy when Murray comes back. Gannon quickly shut that down. ""When Kyler is healthy enough to play, he'll play,"" Gannon told Burns & Gambo on Arizona Sports . The Michael Vick comment that went viral Then came Wednesday's headline-grabbing moment. Asked during his press conference about learning to control his emotions as a coach, Gannon flatly replied: ""2007. When our quarterback went to jail."" That was Gannon's final answer of the presser before walking off. Gannon was referencing his time as a quality control coach for the Atlanta Falcons during Michael Vick's suspension and prison sentence related to a dogfighting investigation. While the moment may have been intended to show perspective gained early in his career, the blunt delivery left many stunned -- and the clip quickly went viral. Is Gannon feeling the heat? All of it raises a familiar question: Is Gannon's seat getting warm? The Cardinals have now been under .500 in each of his first two seasons (4-13 in 2023, 8-9 in 2024), and their 2-4 mark entering Week 7 has them tied with the New York Giants for the NFC's second-worst record. Arizona started 2-0 but has since dropped four straight and fallen to the bottom of the NFC West. It's possible these actions from Gannon, who signed a five-year deal in 2023, are concerns about his job status bubbling to the surface. Because if Arizona doesn't turn things around, it could very well result in him getting the boot at the end of the year.",https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/cardinals-jonathan-gannon-sideline-clash-michael-vick-comment,Sport,cbssports.com,,https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2025/10/16/f57e7dc1-6ece-4b96-b0b8-1fc12a55a38d/thumbnail/1200x675/6bec5169bb78b071b09ff7d91dc13b3f/template-pic.jpg,2025-10-16T15:19:28+00:00,2c59c82a1dcbb7d5e73da2c52693c52caa002f45

d36d451ff0df,"College basketball rankings: Michigan State, Auburn among teams in AP Top 25 who could miss NCAA Tournament",,"In every college basketball season since 2012, at least one team that began the season ranked in the AP Top 25 has failed to reach the NCAA Tournament. In the past three years alone, there were 13 teams ranked in the preseason that didn't reach March Madness . It's basically a guarantee that at least one team we are lauding in October will be flopping by February. Over the past 13 years (excluding the COVID-impacted 2019-20 season) an average of four teams ranked in the preseason poll fell short of the Big Dance. Last season, there were three culprits (No. 17 Indiana , No. 20 Cincinnati and No. 25 Rutgers ). Arguably the most famous recent example is from the 2022-23 season, which is when North Carolina became the first-ever preseason No. 1 team to fail to reach the NCAA Tournament. Those Tar Heels serve as the ultimate case study in how, just because a team looks good on paper, it doesn't mean they'll be good in reality. College basketball rankings: Each AP Top 25 team's strengths, weaknesses and depth chart entering 2025-26 Isaac Trotter Given recent history, it's safe to assume there will be at least a couple of teams ranked in this year's preseason poll that fall short of expectations. For this edition of the Dribble Handoff, our writers are picking the ranked teams they believe could miss the NCAA Tournament. I'll stay true to the Top 25 And 1 and start this list with Creighton, which is the only team in the Associated Press Top 25 preseason poll that isn't in my rankings. Does that mean I'm actually predicting the Bluejays to miss the 2026 NCAA Tournament? No. It just means that, by definition, according to my rankings, they are the team most likely to miss the field after losing the top three scorers from last season's team -- among them Ryan Kalkbrenner, an All-American who was a four-time Big East Defensive Player of the Year. Simply put, collectively, the players who exited Creighton's program seem to be better, at least on paper, than the ones who just enrolled at the Omaha-based school earlier this offseason. That's usually not good. And, don't forget, last season's theoretical better roster still only received a No. 9 seed in the 2025 NCAA Tournament before finishing 35th at KenPom.com . If you're curious, the Bluejays are now sitting at 41st in KenPom's preseason rankings, making them the lowest rated team in that computer that voters placed in the preseason AP poll. -- Gary Parrish Well, I suppose I have to tip my hand just a smidge here. My thinking is similar to GP's. Every year, I research and compile a ranking of the top 101 teams heading into the season. My rankings are finished but that piece won't publish until next week. That in mind, I'll reveal that the AP Top 25 team that I have ranked lowest is in fact Wisconsin. So logic would dictate I need to pick Bucky as my whiff candidate here (and yet, though this will obviously prove to be incorrect, I actually think every preseason Top 25 team is going to make the 2026 NCAA Tournament). My Wisconsin thinking goes: John Tonje (who was an All-American, remember!), Max Klesmit and Steven Crowl will not be replaced in the aggregate. UW went 27-10 and got a  No. 3 seed. Badgers fans should expect a step back for sure, but with a mix-matched group of transfers coming in to support John Blackwell , I wouldn't be shocked if Wisconsin just missed out. I also think the Big Ten will be the best league in the country, which will affect Wisconsin's push to be in the top six or seven in the league standings by mid-March. -- Matt Norlander How many programs in college basketball, realistically, could withstand the loss of a potential future Hall of Fame coach and be as good (or even better) after they stepped aside just weeks before the start of the season? Think about it. There's probably no schools that come to mind because it's highly unlikely any program would be in a better spot in that situation. That's the basis here on why I'm skeptical Auburn can maintain its preseason expectations as a top-25 team. With Bruce Pearl transitioning into a new role at Auburn and son Steven Pearl now head coach , it's reasonable, and even likely, I'd argue, that Auburn has downgraded dramatically at head coach. That's not to say Steven will fail or even that he won't do well. Don't hear what I'm not saying. But replacing a coach in the elder Pearl who retires with a career winning percentage better than Eddie Sutton, Rick Pitino and Bob Knight, among many others, is a gargantuan ask. Especially for a program that is now handing the keys to a first-time head coach at a place that has largely been unsuccessful in basketball without him. Tahaad Pettiford and the top of Auburn's roster is very good. Steven is set up for success. Auburn, over the short- and long-term, should largely succeed because of how the foundation was set over the last decade. But if any top-25 team finishes unranked or even misses the NCAA Tournament entirely, my bet would be on the Tigers. The SEC will take no prisoners and it can swallow up even the best coaches. If this team misses the Big Dance in five months I don't think we should be surprised given the headwinds it faces. -- Kyle Boone No. 22 Michigan State If this roster were coached by anyone else other than Tom Izzo, there is no chance it would be ranked in the preseason AP poll. But because it's Izzo who is on the sidelines, Michigan State is getting the benefit of the doubt, and understandably so. The Spartans have reached 27 straight NCAA Tournaments under Izzo, and that mark would be 28 if not for the COVID-impacted 2019-20 season. Izzo, 70, is one of the greatest to ever do it, and he might be able to take a roster full of kids from Michigan State's supply chain management program and lead them to the Big Dance. So, just bookmark this for whenever Michigan State ends up in the Final Four for a ninth time under his direction. Now that my respect and admiration for Izzo has been established, let's take a closer look at the 2025-26 Spartans. As has often been the case in recent years, Michigan State will need to be a team whose whole is greater than the sum of its parts. There are no preseason All-Americans, five-star freshmen or projected NBA lottery picks on this team. There aren't even any rockstar transfers. The top three scorers from a 30-win team are gone, and no one on this roster has ever averaged double figures for a high-major program. While there are four rotation players back from last season, they'll be taking on heightened roles in what figures to be a brutal Big Ten. Izzo deserves to be trusted. But if you take away the coach and do a blind roster breakdown, the Spartans would be no more than a bubble team. -- David Cobb No. 25 North Carolina I wrote about North Carolina not once, but twice during this week. I discussed why the Tar Heels shouldn't be ranked in the initial preseason AP Top 25 poll and should be lower than third in the ACC poll. So, I guess I'm (tripling?) down by picking North Carolina here. The main reason is that UNC coach Hubert Davis doesn't deserve the benefit of the doubt. North Carolina missed the NCAA Tournament entirely when the program was ranked preseason No. 1, reached the Sweet 16 in 2024 and shockingly were one of the ""Last Four"" teams in the field last year. Truthfully, UNC should've been sitting at home. This is a make-or-break season for Davis, and anything less than a deep run in the NCAA Tournament will put him back on the hot seat. UNC's roster is talented, no denying that. Five-star Caleb Wilson is a stud, Arizona transfer Henri Veesaar is a breakout candidate and Alabama transfer Jarin Stevenson has already proven he can step up in the big moment. Losing RJ Davis, one of the top scorers in program history, is a big deal. Colorado State transfer Kyan Evans will have big shoes to fill. What will make or break UNC's case for the NCAA Tournament is nonconference games against Kansas , Kentucky and Michigan State. The ACC is top-heavy this season and North Carolina only plays NC State and Louisville once. If North Carolina struggles in nonconference play, it will be playing behind the eight ball entering ACC play with not many opportunities to rack up signature wins. -- Cameron Salerno No. 23 Creighton Creighton's defense is pretty clearly the worst unit of any team that made the AP Top 25. Greg McDermott is a revered offensive mastermind, but he only had one top-25 defense before Ryan Kalkbrenner arrived in Omaha. With the King of Verticality off to Charlotte , Creighton's defense could take a massive plunge because the personnel on that end is uninspiring. Nik Graves comes from Charlotte, the worst defense in the AAC. Josh Dix and Owen Freeman come from Iowa , where it was defense optional. Oh, and Freeman is still recovering from a knee injury. Is Howard transfer Blake Harper going to be a shutdown defender at the high-major ranks right away? I'm skeptical. What about sweet-shooting Austin Swartz , who Creighton rescued from a Miami dumpster fire? No defense was played in The U for five straight months. McDermott is a smart coach, who will win the shot-quality game, but the personnel is a tad crippling. There's only so much you can do. Creighton faces a steep uphill climb just to get to that top-50 range defensively, which means you're asking an offense with a new starting point guard, new starting shooting guard, new starting wing and new starting center to bail you out time and time again? No, thank you. College basketball is cyclical. Kalkbrenner helped vault Creighton to new heights, but I'm projecting a step back in 2025-26 because you just don't replace dudes like that. -- Isaac Trotter",https://www.cbssports.com/college-basketball/news/college-basketball-rankings-michigan-state-auburn-among-teams-in-ap-top-25-who-could-miss-ncaa-tournament,Sport,cbssports.com,,https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2025/10/16/6eb2c9c4-1810-4397-9e68-fd4bc48e504a/thumbnail/1200x675/89f2a93b808ffaed72d6bb25da4bf13c/usatsi-25809839-1.jpg,2025-10-16T15:12:00+00:00,a951c9e19cb5c19524ae6611db7ca2f960866507

Several NFL prop picks will center on Rodgers, Jaylen Warren , DK Metcalf and other Steelers considering Cincy's poor defense, but Pittsburgh hasn't been a Steel Curtain on that side of the ball either. It ranks 27th in passing defense, so Joe Flacco , Ja'Marr Chase and Tee Higgins will also be popular with NFL player props and Thursday Night Football betting. Rodgers has an NFL prop bar of 219.5 passing yards, after he threw for 235 yards in Week 6 and hit the Over. However, he went under this NFL prop total in three straight games prior to Sunday, and with Cincy possessing the No. 28 run defense, Pittsburgh may lean more on the ground game. With the same prop odds of -112 for the Over and Under, this may be one TNF prop to simply avoid altogether.

Top NFL player prop bets for Bengals vs. Steelers After analyzing the Steelers vs. Bengals props and examining the dozens of NFL player prop markets, the SportsLine's Machine Learning Model  says Bengals WR Chase goes Over 73.5 receiving yards (-114 at FanDuel ). The Steelers have always struggled to contain Chase, who has at least 81 receiving yards in four straight versus Pittsburgh. He's averaged 98 receiving yards over this stretch, and many of those defenses were much better than this year's unit in Pittsburgh. The Steelers are giving up 178.8 receiving yards to opposing wideouts, which is the third-most in the NFL. Chase is also coming off 94-plus receiving yards in each of the last two weeks, and he showed great rapport with Flacco on Sunday, posting a stat line of 10-94-1. It's also important to note that Thursday's game will take place in Cincinnati, where Chase has gone over his receiving yardage prop in each of his last five home games, which includes a Week 13 contest versus the Steelers last season. The AI model projects Chase to have 93.7 receiving yards, giving this NFL prop bet a 4.5-star rating. See more NFL props here .

Few fighters have so much as inconvenienced Chimaev, but Reinier de Ridder believes he has a deep bag of tricks to trap the champ. De Ridder makes final preparations for UFC Fight Night in Vancouver. A win over Brendan Allen on Saturday is imperative to keep him in the title picture. De Ridder, a former two-division ONE Championship titleholder, has trained with Chimaev. De Ridder knows that beating Chimaev is no small feat, but thinks his submission skills and volume striking can overwhelm the reigning champion. ""Skill-wise, I'll be a good match,"" De Ridder told CBS Sports. ""I might be able to take him down and put him on his back. That's a position we haven't seen him in yet. We might end up striking more than he has in his previous fights. I think if he takes me down, I'm very dangerous off my back. I have some cool tricks there. If I end up on top, I think I have a good chance of choking him."" De Ridder is racing to close the gap between him and fellow contender Nassourdine Imavov. No. 2-ranked Imavov recently beat Caio Borralho and has a knockout win over former champion Israel Adesanya . A win over Anthony ""Fluffy"" Hernandez, De Ridder's original opponent, was De Ridder's best chance to make a case over Imavov. Some analysts perceive Hernandez as the best equipped to match Chimaev's relentlessness. Unfortunately, Hernandez was forced off Saturday's card. Replacing Hernandez is Brendan Allen, who recently lost to ""Fluffy"" and Imavov by unanimous decision. De Ridder will have a harder time converting a win over Allen into an immediate title shot, but believes the opportunity still exists. ""It still means something beating him,"" De Ridder said. ""He had close fights with Imavov  and 'Fluffy.' At least he has history with top guys. I think if I'm the  first guy, of the three, to finish him, that means something."" Check out the full interview with Reinier de Ridder below. Imavov will have an open-and-shut case as the top contender. However, De Ridder is still in the conversation with a win. UFC's busy event calendar requires readily available challengers. Few fighters have been as active as De Ridder, who competes for the fifth time in 11 months. De Ridder will be only the eighth UFC fighter to win four fights in a calendar year should he beat Allen this weekend.",https://www.cbssports.com/mma/news/reinier-de-ridder-thinks-he-can-take-down-choke-out-ufc-middleweight-champion-khamzat-chimaev,Sport,cbssports.com,,https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2025/10/16/38b6a860-22f1-4a12-9198-a9090afb5fa0/thumbnail/1200x675/0d219cca88c05ee63364b43cc300dec0/reinier-de-ridder-ufc-fight-night-vancouver-khamzat-chimaev-robert-whittaker-brendan-allen-mma-news-today-oct-16-2025.jpg,2025-10-16T14:55:00+00:00,b9099c5a109268add95f255e874c5d99b3d6d95d
5f862eefab1e,Man arrested for allegedly threatening Utah fans on social media ahead of Holy War rivalry vs. BYU,"byu-utah, holy war rivalry","A 28-year-old Utah man was taken into custody after threatening Utah fans on social media ahead of the Week 8 Holy War rivalry between Utah and BYU . Christopher Tai Justice, booked into Emery County Jail, was linked to an X account @juiceisloose328, according to the Utah Department of Corrections. Authorities say posts from the account threatened violence against Utah fans at LaVell Edwards Stadium in Provo. One Oct. 14 post read, ""I'll be in LES [LaVell Edwards Stadium] Saturday. Any Ute fan I see is dead. Mark my words."" When another user advised him to log off, Justice reportedly replied, ""nah anyone wearing red on Saturday is getting shot."" The account associated with Justice has protected its posts. Investigators said Justice initially denied owning the social media account but later admitted to making the posts after being confronted with screenshots and text messages showing he had planned to deny the threats, according to the report. Justice was booked on alleged misdemeanor threat of violence and obstruction of justice. He is reportedly on probation following a second DUI conviction within 10 years. The arrest came a day after University of Utah and BYU presidents released a joint video urging fans to maintain a safe and respectful environment during the annual Holy War rivalry. While the focus has been on online threats, previous incidents highlight the intensity of the rivalry. In November 2024, a BYU cheer coach was struck in the head by a water bottle thrown from Utah fans during last year's Holy War game at Rice-Eccles Stadium, causing her to lose consciousness. Court documents identified the man accused in that incident as 18-year-old William Andrew Gardner, who was in a south end zone suite above BYU staff. After BYU's win, Gardner allegedly yelled profanities at the team and threw a disposable water bottle, which hit the cheer coach in the head and caused her to collapse. The upcoming matchup marks the 97th meeting between BYU and Utah in the storied rivalry, with the Utes leading the series 59-33-4. However, the Cougars have won the last two meetings, including a dramatic 22-21 victory in Salt Lake City last year, when a 44-yard field goal in the final seconds secured the BYU win. The last time BYU won three consecutive games against the Utes was during a four-game streak from 1989-1992.",https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/news/man-arrested-threatening-utah-fans-social-media-posts-holy-war-rivalry-byu,Sport,cbssports.com,,https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2025/10/16/cec651db-8b28-4e35-9a96-439c3ecfd293/thumbnail/1200x675/0ea7acef0de2f0e5239b5eb099680688/byu-football-stadium.jpg,2025-10-16T14:53:00+00:00,11c9873b2c6a7d59d59f5e2e79a7beb0d52a9651

d905c465f610,"2025 NFL trade deadline: Top players at each position who could be dealt, including Alvin Kamara, Mark Andrews","nfl, trade, nfl trade, nfl trade deadline, mark andrews, alvin kamara","The NFL trade deadline is fast approaching as teams are starting to decide whether they are buyers or sellers. Another week of games should make the direction more straightforward for those teams, but some organizations may already know what they are doing in the coming weeks. There are logical sellers based on the start of the season, along with teams looking to get rid of players on expiring contracts or those not getting enough snaps to justify being on the roster. A change of scenery may be needed for those players, even those on contending teams. As for the buyers at the deadline, there's a good chance we know who they are, but what players could they be targeting? Who is available in the coming weeks around the league? With the Nov. 4 trade deadline fast approaching, let's take a look at the best players available by position. If the Falcons could find a way to get out of Cousins' contract, they would gladly find a taker. Cousins has a cap hit of $57.5 million in 2026 and 2027, but any team that trades for him can save $32.5 million in cap space next season if they move on (per Over The Cap). The 37-year-old Cousins is the No. 2 quarterback on the depth chart, and the Falcons aren't benching Michael Penix Jr . any time soon. Teams that are looking for an improvement at quarterback would consider Cousins, but his contract and cap hit for the remainder of 2025 are keeping the Falcons from actually moving on. The Saints aren't competing for the NFC South this season and there's little sense in retaining a 30-year-old running back with one year remaining on his contract on the roster. Kamara still has some juice as a dual-threat back, rushing for 314 yards (3.8 yards per carry) and having 122 receiving yards (5.5 yards per catch). Kamara provides a spark to any offense with a better roster around him, especially a better offensive line. He' still a featured back if needed, but could be dynamic splitting touches in the backfield. The $18.6 million cap number in 2026 may be why teams don't want to pay a steep price for Kamara. Meyers is in the final year of his contract and is an instant upgrade if a team needs a No. 2 wide receiver. The top wideout in Vegas, Meyers has 329 receiving yards and is averaging 11.3 yards per catch -- but would benefit from playing on a playoff-caliber roster. Coming off a 1,000-yard season, Meyers fits into an offense as a complementary piece. He should blend in smoothly with his route running and ability to open up the middle of the field. The Ravens aren't sellers yet, but they could be with another loss over the next few weeks. Lamar Jackson's top target over the past few seasons could be on the move, as the 30-year-old Andrews is in the final year of his contract and the Ravens have Isaiah Likely at tight end moving forward. A three-time Pro Bowl selection, Andrews is having his worst season with just 174 receiving yards and two touchdowns. Perhaps a chance of scenery would help Andrews as he heads into free agency this offseason. Some offensive linemen do get traded this time of year, but good ones are hard to find around the league. Bitonio is one of them, even if he's in the final year of his contract at 34 years old. Would the Browns trade a player who can protect Dillion Gabriel and help in his development? Highly unlikely, but perhaps they get a draft pick they can't reuse. Bitonio hasn't allowed a sack this season and has just a 3.4% pressure rate allowed per drop back, so he's still good at protecting the quarterback. Teams that need offensive line help should at least attempt to see if Cleveland would part ways with one of the longtime linchpins of their offensive line. Also gives Bitonio a chance to play for a contender in his mid-30s. Do the Bengals actually move on from Hendrickson? The season isn't going as planned, with Joe Burrow likely out for the rest of the year with turf toe and the Bengals struggling to find a competent replacement. A loss this week may have Cincinnati raise the white flag as sellers, meaning Hendrickson is up for bid. Teams badly need a pass rusher, and Hendrickson has the pedigree of an elite one. He has 4.0 sacks, 23 pressures, and a 14.5% pressure rate this season, perhaps needing to play for a contender in the final year of his contract. The Bengals could get some hefty capital if they move on from Hendrickson, and it would be foolish to retain him if the losing streak continues. Hendrickson may be the best player available at the deadline. Interior defensive lineman: Shelby Harris (Cleveland Browns) The defensive tackle market doesn't appear to be as strong as the other positions, but Harris would be a strong get for whatever team can land him. Harris wouldn't cost much in the final year of his contract, and the 34-year-old veteran provides depth at the position. With the Browns as sellers, they likely don't need Harris around. He'll have a chance to play for a contending team. Linebacker: Demario Davis (New Orleans Saints) Davis is one of those players who has gotten better with age, earning five All-Pro selections in his 30s. Now 36 years old, Davis is at the tail end of his career, yet he is still productive at off-ball linebacker. He has 51 tackles and a forced fumble this year, and is playing solid football in the final year of his contract. This is another player who would fit well with a contender as a veteran leader and a fundamentally sound player. Davis is good enough to retire on his own terms, making a playoff-contending team fortunate to have him. Woolen isn't the same player he was in his rookie season, back when he had a 46.1 passer rating in coverage is the primary defender. That rating has gone up each season, as Woolen isn't a fit in Mike Macdonald's defense. In the final year of his rookie contract, teams may take a flyer on the 26-year-old Woolen to assist their secondary. Cornerback is a tough position regardless, but the right scheme could help Woolen become the player he was three years ago. Woolen has played 90% of the snaps in Seattle's defense this year, but Seattle has Devon Witherspoon and Josh Jobe as better fits in that defense. The Seahawks may not get much for Woolen due to his struggles in coverage, but perhaps a team overpays because of his fit in their defense. A former starter in New England, Dugger has been playing just 36% of the snaps in Mike Vrabel's defense. The Patriots have tried to move Dugger after he was demoted to the second string, but haven't found a taker yet. The 29-year-old Dugger has just 15 tackles and no interceptions in his limited snaps, with a 79.0 passer rating in coverage as the primary defender. He has a cap hit of $17 million in 2026 and $18 million in 2027, making moving on from Dugger even harder. Dugger needs to play in the right system, and the Patriots have to be willing to absorb his money to move on. With Kirk Cousins, many teams don't want to have Dugger at that price -- even if they can save $8 million in cap space by moving on after the season.",https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/nfl-trade-deadline-2025-top-players-at-each-position-alvin-kamara-mark-andrews,Sport,cbssports.com,,https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2025/10/16/b8edf76b-c252-4583-a086-2e5accb11542/thumbnail/1200x675/08d81fc5cac53dbb51320609c6169837/mark-andrews-ravens-g.jpg,2025-10-16T14:40:00+00:00,0df9e9bba129c0d046eccb2b3e7588fc19e34578

Scanbox Entertainment is set to release the film theatrically across Scandinavia in November 2025, while Wild Bunch will oversee distribution in German-speaking territories. Additional deals have been secured with World Pictures for the CIS region, Karantajina for the former Yugoslavia, and Front Row for Middle East and North Africa. “The Elf and the Christmas Wonder” follows Lumi and her soul sister Talvi, who have been inseparable since birth, until Talvi is adopted, leaving Lumi behind in their snowy orphanage. Determined to reunite with her, Lumi sets off into the frozen wilderness, only to stumble upon a secret world hidden beneath the snow: a bustling Christmas factory run by elves. With the help of Pyry, a rule-breaking elf with a big heart, Lumi sets out on a Christmas Eve mission aboard Santa’s sleigh.

c105356e0ae3,Keanu Reeves’ Manager Told Him to Change His Name at 20 Years Old. They Considered ‘Chuck Spadina’ Before Using ‘KC Reeves’: ‘And Then I Couldn’t Do It’,,"Keanu Reeves revealed on the “New Heights” podcast that his manager was adamant about changing the actor’s name when he first arrived in Hollywood as a teenager. “I got paid when I was like 16, so I was a professional actor around 16, 17 [years old],” Reeves said. “I was in Toronto, Canada, and then I got a manager who lived in Los Angeles…. At 20 years old, I drove in my car to Los Angeles. Got out of my car and my manager said, ‘We want to change your name.’ So that’s like, a welcome to Hollywood [moment]. I remember I was walking on the beach and I was just like, ‘My name? What if I change my name ? What?” His manager’s request sent Reeves into an existential spiral. Then Reeves started brainstorming what he could possibly change his name to if he wanted to be a Hollywood performer. “My middle name is Charles, so I was like, ‘…Chuck?’ And I grew up on a street called Spadina, [therefore] Chuck Spadina,” Reeves said. “And then I was something Templeton. So then I became KC Reeves. I was credited as KC Reeves…  And then I couldn’t do it. So then I would be in auditions and they would go, ‘KC Reeves.’ And I wouldn’t even answer. Six months later, I was like, ‘I’m not doing this.’ That’s a Hollywood moment.” Reeves actually was credited as “KC Reeves” in one of his first films, a made-for-TV movie in 1986 for the Magical World of Disney. The actor told Jimmy Fallon in 2017 (via EW ) that the “Templeton” name that was considered for him was “Templeton Paige Taylor.” Fortunately by the time Reeves started landing more high profile work in projects like “Dangerous Liaisons” and “Bill & Ted’s Excellent Adventure,” he was being credited by his real name “Keanu Reeves.” Reeves is back on the promotional trail for his new comedy, “ Good Fortune .” Directed by Aziz Ansari and co-starring Seth Rogen and Keke Palmer, the movie casts Reeves as a guardian angel who loses his wings while trying to teach a human that money doesn’t solve one’s problems. The comedy opens in theaters Oct. 17 from Lionsgate. Name changes are a common practice in Hollywood. Leonardo DiCaprio revealed in his own “ New Heights ” interview last month that an ex-agent told him to ditch “DiCaprio” as a young actor because it sounded “too ethnic.” “I finally got an agent. They said, ‘Your name is too ethnic,’” DiCaprio recalled. “I go, ‘What do you mean? It’s Leonardo DiCaprio?’ They go, ‘No, too ethnic. They’re never going to hire you. Your new name is Lenny Williams.’ I said, ‘What is Lenny?’ I was 12,13. I said, ‘What is Lenny Williams?’ ‘We took your middle name and we made it. Now you’re Lenny.’” Watch Reeves’ full interview on the “New Heights” podcast in the video below.

a4e72694ff9a,OnlyFans Documentary ‘Virtual Girlfriends’ to Open Ji.hlava Film Festival,,"The Ji.hlava Intl. Documentary Film Festival will open on Oct. 24 with Czech director Barbora Chalupová’s “Virtual Girlfriends,” which reflects on the OnlyFans internet platform. Through the stories of three women, the film follows the process of content creation, conversations with subscribers, and the everyday dynamics of their romantic and work relationships. Where is the line between work and intimacy, and who is actually the victim in all this? ” ‘Virtual Girlfriend’ is not a sensationalist look at eroticism, but an attempt to understand how intimacy, relationships, and our ideas about closeness are changing in the digital world,” Chalupová said. “The audience in Ji.hlava is curious and sensitive. They perceive current phenomena without prejudice and seek out films that open up space for dialogue. I am glad that our film can open this year’s edition of this festival, which gives space to ethically sensitive and courageous documentaries.” Ji.hlava director Marek Hovorka said, “The film does not dwell on the surface and does not rely on sensationalism, but approaches the more general theme of loneliness in the digital world. The OnlyFans website thus becomes just one of many social networks, and the protagonists of the film are not so different from ordinary users of other social networks as it might seem at first glance.” The film will be screened in both Opus Bonum and Czech Joy sections. The festival will offer 305 films, including 76 world premieres, 28 international premieres, and 15 European premieres. The Opus Bonum competition section will feature 15 films. “Open” by Slovak director Diana Fabiánová explores open marriage through the eyes of the director herself, who turns the camera on herself and her partner, revealing the ethical and emotional layers of intimacy. Maximilien Dejoie’s tragicomic film “Everything Works Out (In the End)” follows former sex worker Katelyn, whose journey for faith, meaning and redemption turns into a parable about U.S. society. The seven-hour film diary “While the Green Grass Grows: A Diary in Seven Parts” by Swiss-Canadian director Peter Mettler offers a meditation on human existence, time, and the places we inhabit. From canyons and deserts to forests and caves, it reveals the universal experiences of life and death and connects spectacular landscape images with intimate details of everyday life. The documentary “Music in a Village Named 1PB” by Indian director Surabhi Sharma transports viewers to the Thar Desert in western Rajasthan, where a Muslim community of musicians preserves poetry and music that transcends the boundaries of religion and nation. The film sensitively shows the connection between people and the landscape, culture, and environment that shapes their identity. Landscape is also an important element in the documentary “Bürglkopf,” about a “return center,” by Austrian director Lisa Polster. The film contrasts the picturesque Alpine scenery of Tyrol with the hopelessness and isolation of the people who live in this landscape involuntarily – rejected asylum seekers placed on top of the Bürglkopf mountain. Panoramic shots of mountains and pastures create an illusion of peace and freedom, which is immediately shattered by the awareness of the existence of a strictly guarded center.

c942c21d140f,"Mipcom 2025: Sunny But Sobering, Galvanised by the Rise of YouTube and the Creator Economy as the TV Industry Shifts Focus Once More",,"CANNES, FRANCE — Mipcom 2025 played out in glorious sunshine, proving, however, in many ways a sobering affair. Since 2022-23 when Netflix first announced a subs decline and then Hollywood’s double strikes, the only certainty has been fear: That a sales-production sector’s chasing a contracted market is not a blip, but the new norm. With attendance just up on 2024’s event, the story of Mipcom 2025 is how the TV industry is reacting to this traction, especially by way of its exploration of possible partnership with YouTube and the creative economy revolution. These and other takeaways from this year’s Mipcom, which ran Oct. 13-17. The Crunch Though attendance at Mipcom this year, edged up on 2024 – plays – the party looks well and truly over. “Almost 18 months after we first identified the trend, we are still at ’75% Peak TV,” Ampere Analysis’ Guy Bisson said Wednesday at Mipcom. In other words, the market has contracted to 75% of its Peak TV Size. Compared to the first half of 2024, first-run scripted TV orders were 6% up in North America but down in Central and South America (-7%), Western Europe (-10%), Asia Pacific (-11%) and Central and Eastern Europe (-15%). Some countries – Spain, France and Italy – have held in commissions. But they are exceptions. Much of the downturn is driven by streamer pull back down over 100% on early 2024, Bisson said. The new reality, moreover, is here to stay, he added. And the Good News? The biggest draw at this edition of Mipcom was the presence of creator economy players . YouTube, which celebrates its 20-year anniversary, made its first official presence at the Cannes-set confab with a crowded session that brought together BBC Studios digital SVP Jasmine Dawson and YouTube’s EMEA boss Pedro Pina discussing their win-win partnership. It was one of the several examples of successful alliances between traditional media and the creator economy talked about at Mipcom — where Banijay unveiled the launch its YouTube-backed Entertainment Creators Lab in France, and announced its acquisition of the Dutch label Werktitel. A decade after hosting the Mip Digital Upfront, a one-off initiative, Mipcom also revisited the topic with a fully-fledged Digital Upfronts that welcomed on stage talents and executives from creator-led production companies, After Party Studios and Dhar Mann Studios, as well the AVOD platform Tubi . Finding a Business Model The big question, of course is: What is the business model?Traditional broadcasters cannot hope to make up the slack from declining advertising and lower audiences in a digital sphere where Costs Per Mille (CPMs) are radically lower, said Ampere’s Bisson. The maths will never add up. Yet they can leverage YouTube and other low CPM players in other ways. Banijay is now doing exactly with animation series “Ava & Digger,” produced by Banijay Kids & Family and digital giant TheSoul Publishing, which has 3 billion – that’s a “b” followers. The series will launch on YouTube later this year, honing and building IP. With data in hand – reach, demos, gender splits –  the partners will then pitch streaming services. Microdramas Dazzle… . What is the most watched form of TV in Colombia,– linear TV, powered by telenovelas, or global streaming services, led by Netflix? Neither, Spanish analyst Geca announced at Iberseries & Platino Industria two weeks ago. In viewing figures, both have been overtaken by microdramas. Hailed by Virginia Mouseler as one of the most watched TV shows of recent times, what title opened The Wit’s Fresh TV Fiction at Cannes on Oct. 15? ReelShorts’ 90-part, 90-second U.S. romantic melodrama “Breaking the Ice,” a vertical made for iPhone which notched up 340 million views in the U.S. ….And Are a Growth Phenom in International Explosively growing, microdramas will reach $11 billion in global revenues by 2025: double the size of FAST channels, María Rua Aguete, at Omdia, announced Monday. Microdramas “combine the immediacy of social media with the emotional depth of television drama. They are short, snackable, and utterly addictive.” So lucrative: Available on subscription/ transactional bases, average user revenue can reach $80 per month. “This is not just a trend – it’s the next wave of content evolution,” Rua Aguete affirmed. Also, they’re taking off most everywhere. At Mipcom, Lebanon’s Scene and Arab World giant Rotana Media announced they would co-produce microdramas, introduced for the first time in the Arab world, they said. Both partners looked very chuffed. Buzz Titles One, leading the pack, is Richard Gadd’s “Half Man.” The latest from the creator of “Baby Reindeer,” a Netflix smash hit, looks like one of the most talked-about series at this year’s confab. Banijay has now sold it to Canadian (Crave) and Australian (Stan) pay TV networks. As Mipcom unspooled, English-language “Hotel Costiera, starring Jesse Williams and located at a luxury hotel on Italy’s dazzling Positano coast,” hit No. 1 on Prime Video U.S. amid fulsome sales. “The appetite for this kind of bold, sky-blue drama is clear,” Fremantle ’s Jens Richter told Variety . Globo’s “Perfect Days” made both Variety’s Must-See TV and The Wit’s Fresh TV Fiction. Sally Wainright’s “Riot Women,”sold by Mediawan Rights, proved one of the most popular titles in the The Wit’s showcase. ‘Out of the Box’ Toy Brand Films and Series Toy brands like Hasbro, Lego and Mattel continue to develop their IP in the audiovisual space, but the movies and shows still need to stand on their own feet. Robbie Brenner, president of Mattel Studios and chief content officer, spoke about her plans for film and TV versions of IP like Masters of the Universe and Matchbox. The intention was “to find ways to tell those stories that feel authentic, and that they have integrity, and actually celebrate brands but to do it in a way that feels interesting and out of the box and unexpected,” she said. One Mantra: Flexibility in Rights Dealing Exclusivity is less of a priority when it comes to rights, and there’s a greater willingness to collaborate. “We want to find the audience wherever we can,” Ben Samek, CEO of Banijay Americas. “The more flexibility there is in the market, the more value there’ll be for lots of players.” Kate Phillips, BBC’s chief content officer, underscored the value of partners, such as Amazon on “The Night Manager.” “They can just increase the ambition and increase the impact. In a crowded global market, trying to get drama that breaks through is getting harder and harder so the more partnerships we have, the better.” What Territories Are Popping? Brazil. Or, rather, at least TV giant Globo. On the eve of Mipcom, at a Carlton Hotel Showcase, Globo walked an industry audience through its latest production deals with the BBC (an Amazon two-part doc), Fox (an Xmas feature) and Ron Leshem’s Crossing Oceans and Janeiro Studios (a Rio de Janeiro new X-Gen focused series). Drilled down on by Globoplay’s Alex Medeiros at Cannes, Globo now has deals with Disney (four movies), Turkey’s Ay Yapim (Turkish remakes of Globo novelas, such as “Leyla,” sold to 20+ territories), Gaumont (“Deluxe”), Beta Film, Fremantle (“Crime Inc.) and Telemundo (a first title TBA). Globo is entering the global mainstream. And, Yes, Flanders The northern part of Belgium, speaking a form of Dutch. Malin-Malin-Sarah Gozin’s hilarious, melancholic and eco-conscious “Dead End,” where a sleuth has to nibble a part of corpse to get a really good idea as to how it died, was reckoned by many as the most notable drama at April’s Canneseries. At The Wit’s Fresh TV Fiction, Flanders had five shows selected: Fun crime series “The Big Fuck Up,” sisters’ reckoning road movie “How To Kill Your Sister,” interior design world-set drama “Eyecatchers,” daily drama “Florentina” and microdrama “Red Flag.” That’s a large presence at Fresh TV Fiction than any other territory in the world, including Europe’s streaming leaders,  U.K. and Spain, which both had four a piece.

e2aa9bf80f35,‘The Idea of You’ Author Robinne Lee Sets Second Novel ‘Crash Into Me’ for Summer 2026 (EXCLUSIVE),,"Robinne Lee , author of the bestselling romance novel “ The Idea of You ,” will publish her second book, “Crash Into Me,” next summer. Lee’s debut, 2017’s “The Idea of You” — about a woman on the precipice of turning 40 who embarks on a whirlwind romance with the lead singer of a boy band — sold nearly a million copies worldwide. The film adaptation, starring Oscar winner Anne Hathaway alongside Nicholas Galitzine, became a global sensation, drawing over 50 million viewers on Amazon’s Prime Video and becoming the streamer’s No. 1 romantic comedy debut of all time. “Women feel like I see them and see their worth and their value; how they want the world to see them as — and how they’re afraid that the world no longer sees them,” Lee told Variety about “The Idea of You’s” breakthrough success. “I’ve given them permission to live that reality more fully, and to step outside of the box that society’s placed them in.” Likewise, “Crash Into Me” is described as a “bold and fresh novel of love, lust and self-discovery.” The novel follows Cecilia Chen, a wife and mother who reluctantly relocates from Paris to Los Angeles for her husband’s work with their two children in tow. As the title suggests, the story’s inciting incident is a car crash, and the other driver is Anouk Ferrand, a swan-necked beauty from Cecilia’s past. “It’s been 20 years since she last encountered the enigmatic model, on a photo shoot in Mexico,” the book’s synopsis details. (The year was 1996. Cecilia was a photographer’s assistant; Anouk was an unknown model, and this was the shoot that made her name.) “And it’s this chance meeting that will upend Cecilia’s life.” The synopsis continues: “Sexy and spellbinding, at ‘Crash Into Me’s’ core are familiar and complex challenges for many women: how to express creativity, how to be frankly sexual and emotionally vibrant in and out of a marriage, how to be an authentic friend and a good mother. In Cecilia, Lee creates a character straddling cultures: she’s an artist of Jamaican descent from the East Coast married to a Frenchman whose career has catapulted beyond her own.” The intensity of the women’s physical and emotional entanglement is the driving force of the narrative, which also aims to hook readers by exploring the dynamics of Cecilia’s conflicted marriage and her worries about raising her multiracial children amid L.A.’s climate of privilege and power. “Will what happened between them two decades ago sever the fragile bonds of the present? Will their addictive relationship destroy everything Cecilia has built? Will she find her way home?” the story posits. In a statement previewing the book, Lee teased: “I wanted to seduce my readers with a privileged, glamorous backdrop and an uncertain future. To lead them on an unexpected journey. Show them the world through a different lens. And give them something to think about long after the last page.” St. Martin’s Press has acquired the North American rights to the novel, which will be published on July 7, 2026. Elizabeth Beier, St. Martin’s executive editor, acquired the rights in a deal brokered by Richard Pine of InkWell Management.

bdff1459edc2,‘Roofman’ and Channing Tatum to Compete in Golden Globes Comedy Categories (EXCLUSIVE),,"“ Roofman ” is leaning into the laughs. Paramount Pictures will submit the crowd-pleasing crime film “Roofman” for consideration in the best motion picture – musical or comedy category at the 83rd Annual Golden Globe Awards, Variety has learned exclusively. The film, directed by Derek Cianfrance and starring Channing Tatum and Kirsten Dunst , has been gaining awards-season momentum since its world premiere at the Toronto International Film Festival, where it received a rare standing ovation. Based on the unbelievable true story of Jeffrey Manchester, “Roofman” follows a former Army Ranger (Tatum) who begins robbing McDonald’s restaurants by cutting through their roofs — later hiding inside a Toys “R” Us for months after a prison escape. The story takes a turn when Manchester falls for a single mother, Leigh (Dunst), sparking a charming yet suspenseful game of cat and mouse. Tatum will be submitted for lead actor (comedy or musical). If nominated, it would mark the actor’s first major nod of his career, despite a wide-ranging body of work across comedy, action, and drama movies such as “Foxcatcher” and the “Jump Street” series. His performance has been widely hailed as a career-best, drawing a TIFF Tribute Performer Award. Dunst, a four-time Golden Globe nominee, will be submitted for supporting actress. Her turn as Leigh has also been heavily praised for its emotional depth and comedic timing. The film also features an ensemble cast including Peter Dinklage, LaKeith Stanfield, Juno Temple and Uzo Aduba, all of which will be submitted in their respective supporting acting categories. Multiple Golden Globe voters and international audiences have screened “Roofman” through festival screenings in Toronto, Greece, Belgium, Switzerland and London, in addition to its U.S. premiere in Los Angeles. The overwhelming reception has focused on the film’s unexpected humor and tonal originality, despite its true-crime origins. Ahead of the Toronto premiere, the film landed Tatum and Cianfrance on the cover of Variety’s TIFF issue . Cianfrance, who co-wrote the screenplay with Kirt Gunn, will be submitted for director and screenplay consideration. Cianfrance is a past DGA Award winner for helming commercials for Nike Gold and Powerade in 2016, and an Oscar and WGA nominee for the drama “Sound of Metal” (2020), which he shared with co-writers Darius Marder and Abraham Marder. Some of his other past notable titles include the crime drama “The Place Beyond the Pines” (2012) and the raw love story “Blue Valentine” (2010) which received a best actress nom for Michelle Williams. Currently certified fresh on Rotten Tomatoes with an 84% rating, “Roofman” was released domestically on Oct. 10. The Golden Globe nominations will be announced on Dec. 8.

The film, which marks Polaha’s directorial debut, will be released February 6, 2026. “I was drawn to this unique story that explores fame and the supernatural, while managing to be at turns funny, romantic, and spooky,” said Polaha, who leads the film as Sam Reinhold, a struggling impressionist who makes a pact with nefarious puppet Fergus. The puppet both catapults Sam’s career and puts his well-being in peril. “The movie is a romp. Working on both sides of the camera to tell this story was an extremely gratifying experience.” “Mimics” stars singer Mōriah, Chris Parnell, Stephen Tobolowsky, Jesse Hutch, Jason Marsden and Austin Basis. The film, which premiered at Cordillera International Film Festival, was produced by Ken Carpenter under his Nook Lane Entertainment banner, along with Polaha; Adam Karm and Ben Wagner produced with Podunk Productions and AKA Productions. “I’ve collaborated with Kris several times, where he’s always delivered so well as an actor. I had every confidence that as a director, he’d find the spine of this special story,” said Carpenter. “He had a firm grasp on the directing wheel at every turn (while also acting and producing), and managed to blend elements of comedy, romance, and a thriller into a fun, scary, and cohesive story. That’s no small task. I’m eager for audiences to step into the world he created for ‘Mimics.'” Michael Scott, Panoramic Picture CEO added. “Kristoffer and Ken and the team they put together have told a very engaging story that’s entertaining and timely. We’re very much looking forward to taking the film out in theaters in February.” Polaha is repped by Gersh and Sugar 23.

aac431a651c9,"Claes Bang Stars as Himmler’s Masseur in ‘I Is Another,’ With Beta Cinema Selling at AFM",,"Beta Cinema has boarded international sales for “I Is Another,” about Nazi henchman Heinrich Himmler’s masseur, starring Claes Bang and Valerie Pachner. The film, directed by Felix Randau (“Iceman”), will launch at the American Film Market. The story is set in autumn 1952: journalist Hedda and her husband Winfried ambush Felix Kersten, former massage therapist to SS Reich Leader Himmler on a train to Oslo. Kersten is said to have helped thousands of concentration camp prisoners to freedom during the Nazi era—at least according to his own account. But Hedda has her doubts. She considers Kersten a mythmaker who is using fabricated heroic deeds to put himself in the running for the Nobel Peace Prize. What begins as an interview develops into a tense, psychological cat-and-mouse game: Kersten, rhetorically brilliant and armed with alleged evidence, encounters a stubborn opponent who relentlessly confronts him with contradictions. As the conversation comes to a head, the announcement of the Nobel Peace Prize winner draws ever closer. Randau directs from his own script, with cinematography by Sebastian Thaler (“Transatlantic,” “7500”). The cast also includes Susanne Wuest (“Sound of Falling,” “Goodnight Mommy”), Timocin Ziegler (“Learning to Die”), and Martin Müller. Beta Cinema commented: “Felix Randau’s new film explores the blurred lines between truth and self-mythologizing. The story of Himmler’s masseur is as controversial as it is compelling, and Claes Bang brings a powerful presence to this morally complex role.” “I Is Another” is produced by Ostlicht Filmproduktion (Marcel Lenz, Claritta Kratochwil) in co-production with Wega Film (Veit Heiduschka, Christian Bachmann, Julia Heiduschka), in collaboration with Mitteldeutscher Rundfunk, BR and Arte. The production is supported by MDM, ÖFI, DFFF, FFA, Filmfonds Vienna and the Thuringian State Chancellery. Principal photography wrapped on Sept. 3, with filming locations in Leipzig, Weimar and Vienna.

6980379a5f0a,Shae Cornette Joins ESPN’s ‘First Take’ After Molly Qerim Exit,,"Shae Cornette gets the hot seat at ESPN . The “SportsCenter” anchor will take on hosting duties on “ First Take ,” the hot-talk sports program built around the oratory and opinions of Stephen A. Smith . She replaces Molly Qerim in the role, who served as the program’s quiet sheriff maintaining a steadfast presence that may not have been the showiest, but which always commanded respect. Qerim had been with “First Take” since 2015, when it was still part of the schedule of ESPN2. Cornette, who has been filling in on “First Take” since Qerim’s departure, make her official debut on Monday, Nov. 3. She will wrap her duties on “SportsCenter” on October 25, with a final show. “Hosting ‘First Take’ is no easy assignment. It requires confidence, toughness, and real sports insight — and Shae brings all of that and more,” said Smith, in prepared remarks. “:I’ve seen her command the desk with poise and passion every time she’s hosted. She’s the real deal, and I’m thrilled to have her officially join the team.” Any move at “First Take” probably requires a second or third. The show is one of the most popular programs on ESPN , so much so that the Disney sports-media giant recently agreed to a mammoth new contract with Smith that allows him to offer his take on politics and other topics in venues that aren’t owned by Disney. Cornette is “meticulous in her preparation, connects naturally with our show’s high-profile personalities, and has a unique ability to keep lively debate engaging and on point,” said David Roberts, executive vice president and executive editor of sports news and entertainment at ESPN. “Her professionalism, presence, and energy make her an ideal fit for ‘First Take’ and a great addition to one of ESPN’s most successful franchises.” Before moving to “SportsCenter,” Cornette helped host ESPN’s college sports coverage and digital shows during major events. Previously, she worked for Chicago’s Fox station, covering the Bears and leading hier own weekly sports program. She began her career with roles on Big Ten Network and The Chicago Huddle on ABC 7. She graduated from Indiana University with a degree in broadcast journalism and kinesiology. “I feel ready to step into this role and know I can add to the already successful brand that First Take is,” Cornette said in a statement. “My journey at ESPN has been one of growth, challenge, and opportunity. ‘First Take’s’ energy, perspective and passion represents everything I love about sports, and I’m excited to bring more of that to the debate desk every weekday morning.”",https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/shae-cornette-espn-first-take-host-stephen-a-smith-1236554484,Entertainment,variety.com,Brian Steinberg,https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Shae-Cornette.jpg?w=1000&h=563&crop=1,2025-10-16T14:46:24+00:00,32cb58379da75fbe6b3c97ea743c02e85300a256
8fd7af0a829a,SpaceX has plans to launch Falcon Heavy from California—if anyone wants it to,,"There's more to the changes at Vandenberg than launching additional rockets. The authorization gives SpaceX the green light to redevelop Space Launch Complex 6 (SLC-6) to support Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy missions. SpaceX plans to demolish unneeded structures at SLC-6 (pronounced ""Slick 6"") and construct two new landing pads for Falcon boosters on a bluff overlooking the Pacific just south of the pad. SpaceX currently operates from a single pad at Vandenberg —Space Launch Complex 4-East (SLC-4E) —a few miles north of the SLC-6 location. The SLC-4E location is not configured to launch the Falcon Heavy, an uprated rocket with three Falcon 9 boosters bolted together. SLC-6, cocooned by hills on three sides and flanked by the ocean to the west, i s no stranger to big rockets. It was first developed for the Air Force's Manned Orbiting Laboratory program in the 1960s, when the military wanted to put a mini-space station into orbit for astronauts to spy on the Soviet Union. Crews readied the complex to launch military astronauts on top of Titan rockets, but the Pentagon canceled the program in 1969 before anything actually launched from SLC-6. NASA and the Air Force then modified SLC-6 to launch space shuttles. The space shuttle Enterprise was stacked vertically at SLC-6 for fit checks in 1985, but the Air Force abandoned the Vandenberg-based shuttle program after the Challenger accident in 1986. The launch facility sat mostly dormant for nearly two decades until Boeing, and then United Launch Alliance, took over SLC-6 and began launching Delta IV rockets there in 2006. The space shuttle Enterprise stands vertical at Space Launch Complex-6 at Vandenberg. NASA used the shuttle for fit checks at the pad, but it never launched from California. Credit:

          
          NASA ULA launched its last Delta IV Heavy rocket from California in 2022, leaving the future of SLC-6 in question. ULA's new rocket, the Vulcan, will launch from a different pad at Vandenberg. Space Force officials selected SpaceX in 2023 to take over the pad and prepare it to launch the Falcon Heavy, which has the lift capacity to carry the military's most massive satellites into orbit. No big rush Progress at SLC-6 has been slow. It took nearly a year to prepare the Environmental Impact Statement. In reality, there's no big rush to bring SLC-6 online. SpaceX has no Falcon Heavy missions from Vandenberg in its contract backlog, but the company is part of the Pentagon's stable of launch providers. To qualify as a member of the club, SpaceX must have the capability to launch the Space Force's heaviest missions from the military's spaceports at Vandenberg and Cape Canaveral, Florida.",https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/10/spacex-has-plans-to-launch-falcon-heavy-from-california-if-anyone-wants-it-to,Innovation,arstechnica.com,,https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/GettyImages-2211835625-1152x648.jpg,2025-10-16T15:40:14+00:00,3ecb37b8a5015a92c7b20f6a161377938af0c5af
e4a1cf1a01a8,What to know about the New York City mayoral debates,"news, donald trump, elections, politics, united states, us & canada","It was a primary that sent shock waves through the Democratic Party and captured nationwide attention in the United States. In June, democratic socialist Zohran Mamdani bested his better-known rival, former New York state Governor Andrew Cuomo , to secure the Democratic nomination to be New York City’s next mayor. Recommended Stories list of 3 items end of list Now, New York City is preparing for the final vote in its mayoral contest on November 4. But before voters head to the polls, they will have the chance to watch a series of two debates between the main candidates: Mamdani, Cuomo and Curtis Sliwa. The first airs on Thursday night. The stakes go beyond the question of who will govern the city. New York’s mayoral contest has become a flashpoint about the future of the Democratic Party and the changing politics surrounding US support for Israel, among other issues. Learn about the debates, the candidates and what issues are likely to figure prominently in this brief explainer. When are the debates? There will be two debates held before the election, each of them set to include the three main candidates. The first is on October 16 at 7pm US Eastern Time (23:00 GMT) and will be hosted by local news outlet WNBC. The second will take place on October 22 at 7pm US Eastern Time (23:00) and will be hosted by Spectrum News NY1, another local news channel. How can I watch? In New York City, the mayoral debates will be broadcast live on local television chains including WNBC, Spectrum News NY1 and PIX11. For those outside the metropolitan area, the debates will be available live on the YouTube channels for those stations. You can find NY1’s YouTube page here , and WNBC’s here . Who are the candidates? There are three main candidates in the race. Leading the field is Zohran Mamdani , a democratic socialist and member of the New York State Assembly whose rapid rise has been interpreted as a sea change within the Democratic Party. In February, an Emerson College poll found Mamdani trailing the pack, with less than one percent support. But by the time the Democratic primary arrived in June, the dark horse had become the frontrunner. He ultimately trounced his nearest rival, Andrew Cuomo , with 56 percent of the primary vote, in a contest widely viewed as a bellwether in the strongly Democratic-leaning city. Cuomo, however, remains Mamdani’s main competitor. After his loss in the primary, Cuomo announced he would continue his run as an independent in November’s general election. Cuomo served as New York’s governor from 2011 to 2021, but he ultimately resigned amid numerous allegations of sexual harassment. Finally, representing the Republican Party in the election is Curtis Sliwa, a conservative anti-crime activist and regular fixture in the city’s political scene. He previously ran for mayor in the 2021 race. What happened to the incumbent, Mayor Eric Adams? Mayor Eric Adams had been among the contenders for this year’s mayoral race. But in late September, he formally withdrew his bid. Adams had faced slumping poll numbers, and throughout his four years as mayor, he has been dogged by corruption scandals. One culminated with a federal investigation into allegations he had entered into a quid pro quo with the Turkish government. “I was wrongfully charged because I fought for this city,” Adams said in his withdrawal video. He blamed “the constant media speculation” for having “undermined” his ability to raise election funds. Adams had also faced scrutiny about his increasingly close relationship with US President Donald Trump. He visited Trump’s Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida in January, shortly before the Republican leader’s inauguration. Weeks later, in February, Trump’s Justice Department dropped its case against Adams. The mayor has since switched his party affiliation from Democrat to independent. What do polls say about the state of the race? Since Adams dropped out of the race, most recent polls have shown Cuomo gaining ground but trailing behind Mamdani by a substantial margin. A poll from Quinnipiac University on October 9 found Mamdani leading the field with 46 percent support, followed by Cuomo with 33 percent, and Sliwa with 15 percent. The figures for Mamdani and Sliwa were similar to those gathered from a Quinnipiac poll in September, which featured Adams on the ballot. Adams’s decision to drop out appears to have primarily benefitted Cuomo: His poll number rose from 23 percent in September. Other polls show Mamdani with a lead that ranges from around 14 percent to 21 percent. Media reports have suggested that Adams’s decision to exit the race may have been encouraged by Trump himself, in a bid to consolidate opposition to Mamdani. What has President Trump said about the race? Born in the borough of Queens, Trump has lifelong ties to New York City, and he has been vocal in his opposition to Mamdani’s candidacy. Trump has threatened to withhold federal funds from New York should Mamdani win the election. He has also repeatedly branded Mamdani a communist, a false allegation. “ I think he’s terrible,” Trump said of Mamdani after his primary win.  ”I think he’s bad news, and I think I’m gonna have a lot of fun with him, watching him, because he has to come right through this building to get his money.” “I  think the people in New York are crazy,” Trump added. “If they go this route, I think they’re crazy.” What issues will be discussed at Thursday’s debate? While debate topics are not announced in advance, a range of local and national issues are likely to be discussed. One question in particular is looming over the city’s election: How will the next mayor manage threats and intimidation from President Trump? The Republican leader has already deployed troops and federal immigration agents to Democrat-run cities across the country and slashed funds for areas he sees as politically unfriendly. The candidates may also be asked about their plans to address cost-of-living concerns, affordability and improvements to local transportation, three issues that have featured prominently in the mayoral race. Questions about Israel’s war in Gaza, which has killed nearly 68,000 Palestinians, have also figured prominently in the race. Mamdani is an outspoken supporter of Palestinian rights and has criticised Israel’s war as a genocide, a position held by a large number of scholars and rights groups as well as a majority of Democratic voters. In July, just 8 percent of Democrats said they approved of Israel’s military actions, according to a Gallup poll. Cuomo, for his part, is a strong supporter of Israel and previously volunteered his services for a group of legal professionals defending Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu against accusations of war crimes. In recent months, however, the former governor has struck a more conciliatory tone, telling The New York Times in a September interview that the violence has been “horrific”. A delicate ceasefire has since taken hold in Gaza.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/16/what-to-know-about-the-new-york-city-mayoral-debates,World,aljazeera.com,,https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/AP25164099284251-1750697615.jpg?resize=1200%2C675,,def9abb05e21f9d24400138cd764b970257d86e7

In a social media post on Thursday, Katz said that al-Ghamari was attacked in an Israeli strike. “We will do the same against any threat in the future as well”, he added. Al-Ghamari’s death was announced six days into a fragile US-backed ceasefire between Israel and Hamas in Gaza. The truce has halted Israel’s two-year war on Gaza, which has killed nearly 68,000 Palestinians and triggered a dire humanitarian crisis. Israel has been accused by rights groups and a United Nations Commission of Inquiry of carrying out a genocide in Gaza. Since Israel launched the war on Gaza in October 2023, the Houthis have carried out drone and missile attacks against Israel, saying that they have been conducted in solidarity with Palestinians under fire. The group has also targeted vessels in the Red Sea. In response to the Houthi attacks on shipping lanes, the United States and the United Kingdom have attacked Houthi sites in Yemen. ‘Brutal’ attacks In its statement announcing al-Ghamari’s death, the group condemned repeated “brutal” attacks by Israel against the Yemeni people, residential neighbourhoods, economic facilities and other civilian infrastructure, which have been faced “with patience, strength, steadfastness and resilience”. Operations carried out by Yemen’s armed and naval forces were “great victories” that would not have happened without the “support, guidance, and sacrifice” of fighters like al-Ghamari, the statement added. Their statement said the Houthis had carried out 758 military operations deploying 1,835 munitions, including drones and missiles, during their campaign. Israeli strikes on war-torn Yemen happen regularly and are often devastating, targeting vital infrastructure including the main international airport, while killing dozens at a time. The Houthis’ leader, Abdel-Malik al-Houthi, praised al-Ghamari’s major role in Yemen’s military operations in support of Gaza. In a televised address on Thursday, he said the armed forces had offered their leaders as a “sacrifice to God” as part of what he described as a sincere and steadfast stance of resistance. Al-Houthi said Yemen had acted despite US attempts at “isolating” the Palestinian people. He added that since al-Ghamari’s death, others in leadership and the military will “continue the path”. Last week, after the ceasefire in Gaza was announced, al-Houthi said the group would monitor Israel’s compliance with the agreement and resume its support for Gaza if Israel failed to adhere to it.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/16/yemens-houthis-say-military-chief-killed-as-israel-claims-responsibility,World,aljazeera.com,Al Jazeera Staff,https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2025-10-10T122434Z_648768245_RC209HAN3T3U_RTRMADP_3_ISRAEL-PALESTINIANS-PROTESTS-YEMEN-1760626371.jpg?resize=1920%2C1440,,f5322a3f6672e0580cc15f6e9f0dc27be73df302

13560ecf8b8e,How ByteDance Made China’s Most Popular AI Chatbot,"made in china, china, bytedance, apps, chatbots, artificial intelligence","When Chinese AI startup DeepSeek became a global sensation in January, it not only shocked Silicon Valley but also startled ByteDance, TikTok’s parent company. The Chinese tech giant had already launched Doubao, its own flagship AI assistant app with tens of millions of users. But when DeepSeek became the best-known Chinese AI company overnight, no one was talking about Doubao anymore. Now, ByteDance has gotten its revenge. By August, Doubao regained the throne as the most popular AI app in China with over 157 million monthly active users, according to QuestMobile , a Chinese data intelligence provider. DeepSeek, with 143 million monthly active users, slipped to second place. The same month, venture capital firm a16z also ranked Doubao as the fourth-most-popular generative AI app globally, just behind the likes of ChatGPT and Google’s Gemini. Doubao, which launched in 2023, was deliberately designed to be personable. Unlike most popular AI chatbots, Doubao’s app icon features a human-looking avatar—a female cartoon character with a short bob that greets people when they open the app for the first time. The name Doubao literally translates to “steamed bun with bean paste,” mimicking “the nickname a user would give to an intimate friend,” ByteDance vice president Alex Zhu said in a public speech in 2024 . Compared to Western AI apps, “there's a warmer, more welcoming feel,” says Dermot McGrath, a Shanghai-based investor and technologist. “ChatGPT, for example, feels like a tool you open to complete a task and then close again. Doubao has more features and a more colorful user interface that keeps you interested longer.” The Everything App Doubao offers users a little bit of everything—it’s like ChatGPT, Midjourney, Sora, Character.ai, TikTok, Perplexity, Copilot, and more in a single app. It can chat via text, audio, and video; it can generate images, spreadsheets, decks, podcasts, and five-second videos; it allows anyone to customize an AI agent for specific scenarios and host it on Doubao’s platform for others to use. One of the most important things about the app, however, is that it’s deeply integrated with Douyin, the Chinese version of TikTok, allowing it to both attract users from the video platform and send traffic back to it. Somehow, ByteDance’s ambitiously sprawling strategy for Doubao has turned out to be exactly what Chinese users wanted. A little over two years since its launch, Doubao has quietly become the AI app that Chinese people—particularly those who aren’t very AI savvy—are actually using. But it has almost no name recognition in the West. “It's marketed at people who are not the most technologically informed, people who may prefer voice chat and video interaction over text,” says Irene Zhang, a researcher at ChinaTalk , a newsletter about Chinese tech. “Some of the earliest Doubao users I heard of were my friends’ grandmothers and aunties.”",https://www.wired.com/story/bytedance-doubao-chatbot-popularity,Technology,wired.com,Zeyi Yang,"https://media.wired.com/photos/68effb552611849cab159a7b/191:100/w_1280,c_limit/business_china_doubao_chatbot.jpg",2025-10-16T16:07:50.885000+00:00,4b453c6e6260cbef6d7a1d313575215bb2f72d23

Finding great gifts for book lovers isn't just about testing for the best e-reader (which we have!) or rounding up all the accessories worth adding to your Kindle (we've done that too), but rather it’s about setting up your favorite reader to keep enjoying stories. You can help your favorite reader enjoy another story with anything from a new reading gadget and a handy accessory to cozy items to settle in for a nice, long reading session. After all, if there's anything we've learned from the rise of #BookTok , it's that there's no lack of accessories and items that can make a reader happier than ever. Here are our favorite gifts for book lovers we're shopping this season. Be sure to also check out our other buying guides, including Best Kindles , Best E-Readers , Best Kindle Accessories , Best Tablets , and Best Digital Notebooks . If you're on the hunt for more gifts, don't miss our guides to the Best Viral Gifts , Best Gifts for Bird Lovers , Best Subscription Boxes for Gifting , and many more . Updated October 2025: We've reorganized this guide and added new gifts from PopSockets, Strapsicle, BukSuk, Passion Planner, James Wax, East Fork, Beautiful by Drew Barrymore, Eberyjey, and Ugg, plus we've included new book sets. Featured Gifts Our Favorite Kindle Amazon Kindle Paperwhite (2024, 12th Generation) Jump to review A Fun Case and Grip PopSockets PopCase Kindle and PopGrip Jump to review A Sleek Sleeve The Quirky Cup Collective E-Reader Sleeves Jump to review Table of Contents AccordionItemContainerButton A New E-Reader When I got back into reading, I fell in love with ebooks and getting free copies from the library that I would read on my Libby app. That year, for my birthday, I was gifted a Kindle from two different people, and I've never looked back. Whether they're a new reader looking for a better or one who's complaining about how heavy their books are, an e-reader makes for a great solution (and you can still get those free library books on it !). Amazon Kindle Paperwhite (2024, 12th Generation) If they don't have a Kindle, the 12th-edition Paperwhite is our favorite one . It's got a warm front light and great battery life, and it comes in a fun pink color. Upgrade to Signature for an auto-adjusting light and more storage (aka more books!). Kobo Libra Color If they have an e-reader but want the option to use color, the Kobo Libra Color is the best option. It lets them use a range of colors as they read, and you can add on a stylus to turn it into a digital notebook. It's got page-turner buttons, which are great and something you won't find on Kindle. E-Reader Accessories From cute cases to handy straps that make reading easier, there's no lack of fun options to add to a Kindle or other e-readers. PopSockets PopCase Kindle and PopGrip PopSockets has a new collection of Kindle cases that have a MagSafe ring, so you can easily pop on a PopSocket grip. The Curled Up With a Good Book design has a matching case and grip you can use together. Strapsicle E-Reader Hand Strap These straps from Strapsicle make it really easy to hold up an e-reader. They're easy to attach, and I even find just using one of the two straps secures it. The limited-edition neon collection is super fun and worth shopping before it runs out. The Quirky Cup Collective E-Reader Sleeves This stylish sleeve is a great gift to give an e-reader user who loves to take their device on the go. It'll keep it protected without taking up more space. Lamicall Gooseneck iPad Holder I struggle with a wrist cyst that makes holding up my Kindle for long periods uncomfortable. This tablet holder works great for tablets and e-readers alike, and it lets my book hover over my head hands-free. Accessories for Physical Book Readers No e-reader? No problem. These book lights solve the constant struggle for a book reader: darkness getting in the way of their reading. Vekkia 14 LED Book Light Our favorite reading light is a super versatile clip-on with an adjustable gooseneck. The two swiveling light bars have seven LEDs each. Glocusent LED Neck Reading Light This lightweight neck light is a great option if your reader might hate clipping something onto the pages. It has three light warmths and six brightness settings. Book Bags If the book lover in your life is known for toting their e-reader or book of choice everywhere they go, here are some fun accessories for carrying them around (and for logging their thoughts as they read!). Hello Clio The Original Kindle Belt Bag This cute belt bag isn't too much wider than a normal one but packs a soft internal pocket made for carrying a Kindle Paperwhite or base Kindle. New York Public Library Library Card Tote Bag This tote bag screams “I love books” in the best way possible. It's a great size with, nice long straps that make it super comfortable to wear. Stickers, Journals, and Annotation Tools Whether they're looking to decorate their e-reader or the pages of their books, there's a fun add-on here for every kind of reader. Strapsicle Sweet Stickers Strapsicle recently launched stickers, with both a sweet and spicy pack. It's a nice-size set that could easily decorate multiple e-readers. Papier Reading Journal If they're constantly crushing a new read, get them a journal to track everything they've read and how they liked it. Book Tabs I don't like primary colors while I annotate my books. This is a similar but much larger pack of book tabs I found at my local Daiso, and the pastel colors are much more pleasing on the eyes as I mark up my book pages. Passion Planner Passion Highlighters I love these highlighters for my paper planners , and they're a great option for readers who light to highlight their passages. There's a highlighter and pen end for each color if they like to underline. Reading Vibes Gifts for your local book lover aren't just giving books and book items. Help them set the mood while they read with these cozy gift ideas. James Wax Reading Time Candle The label says it all. Give them a candle to alert everyone they're busy reading. I've tried all four scents you can choose from, and my favorites are the mimosa and white tea scents. Sony WH-1000XM6 Help them block out the world while read (or take part in immersion reading, where you listen to the audiobook while you read the physical book at the same time) with our favorite noise-canceling headphones . East Fork The Mug Give them a gorgeous mug to stay hydrated with their drink of choice while they read, whether that's a nice cup of tea or a hot toddy. Beautiful by Drew Barrymore Beautiful Electric Kettle They'll need some hot water with that cup of tea, and this chic electric kettle is both stylish and affordable without slacking on performance. Ugg Men's Neuman Give the gift of happy, cozy feet with our favorite set of men's slippers . Our WIRED reviewer says these slippers hold up well and have the classic Ugg front, with a low back that makes them easy to slip on and off. Gorgeous Books and Boxed Sets Looking to give the gift of a true book? These box sets and illustrated editions are worth collecting. Lord of the Rings Illustrated Editions If there's a book I want to get my husband that he's already read, it's these beautiful illustrated editions of Lord of the Rings , The Hobbit , and even The Silmarillion . One Piece Maybe they've been a One Piece fan for years. Maybe they're a new fan after seeing the Netflix series. You can start their collection of the still-running manga or even give a couple initial volumes to get them hooked on the original. Crescent City Boxed Set If they're fans of A Court of Thorns and Roses , it's official: They'll need to read Sarah J. Maas' other series, Crescent City , to keep up with what happens in the next ACOTAR book. The first one is my favorite. Judy Blume Essentials (Boxed Set) by Judy Blume These are a great series of books if you're shopping for an elementary reader or teenager. The books have held up, with Blume’s themes still resonating years later. Book Subscriptions Buying a book for someone can be hard if you're not sure what they're into or what they've already read. But covering a few months of a subscription is the gift that gives over and over again. Audible If you know someone struggling with time to sit down and read, give them an Audible subscription so they can listen to books while they drive, do chores, work out, and so much more. Book of the Month Subscription Book of the Month is a subscription for the reader who loves physical books. Every month, there are five to seven titles to choose from that ship right to their door (they can skip months if nothing catches their eye). Parnassus Signed First Editions Club WIRED reviewer Adrienne So has subscribed for years (on and off) to Parnassus Signed First Editions, from novelist Ann Patchett’s store in Nashville, Tennessee. The books are mainly literary fiction, with occasional nonfiction. Every book she's gotten has been an absolute banger. Power up with unlimited access to WIRED .

The Los Angeles Chargers (-1.5, 48.5) host the Indianapolis Colts in matchup between teams at the top of the early AFC standings, and the Dallas Cowboys (+1.5, 54.5) host the Washington Commanders in a NFC East rivalry game that projects to be a high-scoring affair.

NFL parlays come with a much greater risk than straight bets, but they also carry the potential of a much bigger reward.

The Broncos are projected to win 75% of the time, and the model's winning margin is 10 points, leaving plenty of room to play alternate lines. The Broncos have been one of the better teams in the AFC in 2025, and they may have the best defense in the entire NFL. Denver is coming off a 13-11 win over the New York Jets in London, and enters this matchup riding a three-game winning streak. The Broncos have stormed out to a 4–2 start, their best opening since 2016. Quarterback Bo Nix leads the way with 1,277 passing yards and nine touchdowns, while J.K. Dobbins has churned out 442 rushing yards and four scores.

Metcalf on TNF","anytime touchdown scorer, anytime td scorer, touchdown picks, touchdown scorer, anytime touchdown scorer picks","Thursday Night Football in Week 7 will pit the Cincinnati Bengals against the Pittsburgh Steelers in a battle of 40-year-old quarterbacks as Joe Flacco and Aaron Rodgers lead their respective teams. Flacco was acquired via trade last week and started five days later for the Bengals, while Rodgers was signed late in the offseason and has guided the Steelers to a 4-1 start. How might these seasoned quarterbacks impact the scoring chances of Ja'Marr Chase, Tee Higgins, D.K. Metcalf and Jaylen Warren? Metcalf has scored in four consecutive games, but he's still listed as high as +145 in the anytime touchdown scorer odds for Bengals vs. Steelers. He's one of our top anytime TD scorer picks for Thursday Night Football. Metcalf's over/under for total receiving yards is 65.5. Targeting NFL player props is one way to approach NFL odds at online sports betting sites for Thursday Night Football in Week 7.

The model went 41-21 on top-rated picks dating back to 2024. Anybody following its NFL betting picks at sportsbooks and on betting sites could have seen strong returns. Now, it has revealed its top anytime touchdown picks for Steelers vs. Bengals. Best Week 7 Thursday Night Football anytime TD prop picks: D.K. Metcalf, Steelers (+145, FanDuel) Metcalf has only been targeted 31 times over the first five games of the season, but he's providing incredible value when the ball is going his way. He enters Week 7 with 19 catches for 357 yards and four touchdowns. He's scored in a variety of ways during his current four-game scoring streak, with touchdowns of 2, 12, 25 and 80 yards in that span. The model predicts that Metcalf averages 0.84 touchdowns, but the implied scoring probability is 40.8% . Ja'Marr Chase, Bengals (+145, DraftKings) Despite Burrow (toe) going down in the second game of the season and the Bengals struggling with Jake Browning under center, Chase is putting up solid numbers yet again with 42 catches for 468 yards and four touchdowns. In Flacco's first start, Chase was targeted 12 times and had 10 receptions for 94 yards and a touchdown. He's now scored three times over his last two games and has five touchdowns in six career games against Pittsburgh. The implied scoring probability here is 40.8%, but the model has Chase scoring 0.55 touchdowns on average . Jonnu Smith, Steelers (+360, FanDuel) Acquired as part of a blockbuster offseason trade that also included Jalen Ramsey and Minkah Fitzpatrick, Smith has 17 receptions in his first five games with the Steelers, but has only produced 89 yards. His average distance of target has only been 0.4 yards this season, but the fact that Arthur Smith is scheming him touches in such a fashion spells out his perceived value. He's scored once this season, but the Bengals have given up five touchdowns in the last four weeks to tight ends. The model predicts that Johnson scores 0.26 touchdowns on average, but these odds imply a 21.7% chance of scoring .

944150f1367e,Steelers trying to end this inexplicable 45-year Thursday losing streak in Week 7 against Bengals,,"With six Super Bowl wins, the Pittsburgh Steelers are one of the most successful franchises in NFL history. But despite all their success, there is one thing they've never been able to pull off, which they'll have a chance to do in Week 7: Win a Thursday night road game against a divisional opponent. The Steelers have played a total of eight divisional Thursday games on the road in franchise history, and they've gone 0-8 in those games, which includes going 0-6 under Mike Tomlin. The Steelers had a chance to end the streak last year but ended up losing a 24-19 shocker to the Cleveland Browns in a game where Pittsburgh was favored by 3.5 points. The Steelers will have a chance to end their inexplicable losing streak when they travel to Cincinnati to take on the Bengals in a Thursday game where Pittsburgh is favored by 5.5 points, per Caesars Sportsbook . The streak started in 1980 with a loss to the Houston Oilers, and it's now been going on for 45 years. Oilers (AFC Central) Oilers 6-0 Dec. 4, 1980 Jaguars (AFC Central) Jaguars 20-6 Dec. 2, 1999 Browns (AFC North) Browns 13- Dec. 10, 2009 Ravens (AFC North) Ravens 22-20 Nov. 28, 2013 Ravens (AFC North) Ravens 26-6 Sept. 11, 2014 Browns (AFC North) Browns 21-7 Nov. 14, 2019 Browns (AFC North) Browns 29-17 Sept. 22, 2022 Browns (AFC North) Browns 24-19 Nov. 21, 2024 That's 0-8 straight up and 1-7 against the spread. This streak has been going on for so long that the Steelers have played two divisional games against opponents who aren't even in their division anymore (Jaguars and Oilers/Titans). It's not just divisional games, though, Thursday nights have generally been a nightmare for the Steelers. Since the AFL-NFL merger in 1970, the Steelers are 3-15 in Thursday road games, which is the worst winning percentage of any NFL team in that span. Here's a look at the three teams that have been the worst in Thursday road games since 1970 (via CBS Sports Research): 1. Steelers: 3-15 (.167) 2. Browns: 2-8 (.200) 3. Jets : 3-11 (.214) The fact that the Browns and Jets are on that list isn't a surprise to anyone, but seeing the Steelers lumped in there is definitely shocking. Overall, the Steelers are 12-18 on Thursdays in franchise history. If you look at just the games played since Tomlin was hired, the numbers don't get any better. The Steelers coach is 2-9 on the road in Thursday games, including 0-6 against divisional opponents. Since the start of the 2019 season, the Steelers are 1-5 on Thursday night. If anyone can help the Steelers snap this streak, it's Aaron Rodgers . The four-time NFL MVP has won 11 Thursday night games in his career, which is the second-most in league history. (He has a Thursday record of 11-5.) The only QB with more Thursday wins is Tom Brady , and Rodgers could tie him with a win over the Bengals. It's almost fitting that Rodgers could tie Brady because he'll be tying another Brady mark as soon as he takes the field in Cincinnati. The matchup between Rodgers and Joe Flacco will mark just the second pairing ever of two quarterbacks over the age of 40. The only other time it happened came in 2020 when Brady and Drew Brees played each other three times while playing for the Buccaneers and Saints . Brady also has the most wins of any QB ever against the Steelers with 12, which is worth noting because Flacco is right behind him. If the Bengals pull the upset, not only will Pittsburgh's nightmare losing streak continue, but Flacco will tie Brady for the most wins ever over the Steelers.",https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/steelers-thursday-night-losing-streak-bengals-week-7,Sport,cbssports.com,,https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2025/10/16/0ef799f0-62db-4c8b-b6e3-31d83a9c314e/thumbnail/1200x675/37e8a627c409ef5c307a7ed0360fdfa1/mike-tomlin.jpg,2025-10-16T16:06:00+00:00,ff7be033fa930746c4341844dcdf91e2fabfd7fb

Las Vegas is 2-4 on the year and fourth in the AFC West, while the Chiefs are third at 3-3. Kansas City enters as an 11.5-point favorite, the largest line of the week, so the Chiefs will be an appealing option for those who can still use them.

cd63794c70b5,"Jonathan Kuminga fined $35,000 for making contact with referee arguing no-call in Warriors preseason game",,"Getty Images The NBA announced a $35,000 fine for Warriors forward Jonathan Kuminga for making contact with and pursuing an official during Golden State's preseason game Wednesday night with the Blazers in Portland. Kuminga was upset over a no-call on this drive late in the second quarter, feeling like he got tripped up by the Blazers' defenders,. Kuminga certainly had a reason to be frustrated with the lack of a call, as there was plenty of contact, but he was perhaps a bit overzealous in expressing that frustration (especially for a preseason game ). The television broadcast didn't capture video of the altercation with the official, but Kuminga went up to referee Rodney Mott and made contact with him while arguing the no-call and then kept pursuing him after. That earned him an ejection and the $35,000 fine from the league, which has a zero tolerance policy on making contact with an official. Kuminga's frustration was with the contact to his right ankle, which he injured last year. After the game, Steve Kerr said he liked the fire Kuminga played with and the way he was attacking the rim and the glass with six first half rebounds. The Warriors coach told reporters, ""I don't mind the ejection at all. I kinda liked it, actually."" It's a big year for Kuminga, who had a lengthy, well-documented stalemate with the Warriors this summer over contract negotiations as he was a restricted free agent. He ultimately signed a two-year, $48 million contract with a team option for next season, with the expectation being that he's eventually traded. In the meantime, he'll continue to be asked to play a role he hasn't been particularly enthralled by with the Warriors, but Kerr praised his performance on Wednesday night doing the little things they've asked him to do. Wednesday was his first career ejection and major fine, as he'll have to put that new contract to use in sending a check back to the league.",https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/jonathan-kuminga-fined-35000-for-making-contact-with-referee-arguing-no-call-in-warriors-preseason-game,Sport,cbssports.com,,https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2025/10/16/7d9ef788-7e28-43cc-bb0e-75b136a230b7/thumbnail/1200x675/f0e07d138388d48303e2f7007d1f119c/kuminga.jpg,2025-10-16T16:02:12+00:00,c9158c55ef64610478b6e4282aad1a1e03a7d854

7c7e5e615b39,Eagles make a change to get winning formula back on track: Will philosophical shift produce wins?,"eagles, eagles changes, eagles struggles, can eagles get back on track, can eagles be fixed, what's wrong with eagles","PHILADELPHIA -- Losing consecutive games has effects in strange ways. The Philadelphia Eagles aren't used to losing back-to-back games of late, a feeling many in the locker room have avoided since the end-of-season collapse in 2023 when the team lost six of seven games to close the season. This isn't 2023, but the Eagles don't want things to get to that point either. They couldn't find a way out of that losing streak until locker room and coaching changes were assembled. There's more than enough time in the 2025 season to right the ship. A subtle change could make all the difference. ""No more walkthrough Wednesdays,"" Eagles linebacker Nakobe Dean said with a laugh. ""Some players came with their helmet and said that to Coach [Nick] Sirianni. We gotta go. We gotta have pads on."" The Eagles were out in Wednesday's practice at the NovaCare Complex with the full pads on, to an extent. Sirianni created a walkthrough Wednesday over the past week in correlation to the early portion of their schedule. The Eagles had a short week in Week 6 due to playing ""Thursday Night Football"" on the road, playing the Denver Broncos at home in Week 5 before traveling up the New Jersey Turnpike to face the New York Giants in Week 6 three days later. This is a common practice among NFL teams . yet it isn't common for the Eagles to lose games. Philadelphia won 20 of its last 21 games prior to playing two games in five days, losing once over the past 371 days before facing Denver. The Eagles lost both games to fall to 4-2. They blew a 14-point fourth quarter lead against the Broncos and were destroyed by the Giants, who had a rookie quarterback in Jaxson Dart and a rookie running back in Cam Skattebo -- and no Malik Nabers . NFL Week 7 picks: Jets finally break through, Eagles' misery continues, Chiefs all the way back Tyler Sullivan This was the low point in the Eagles young season. Something had to change. ""He probably was going to change it anyway, knowing Sirianni,"" Dean said. ""It's not a big change. I mean, we went one week without it. But we lost two games and we was like 'all right, let's get back in pads.' There's a lot of superstitious people out there."" This isn't the first time the Eagles have made a change to their practice routine until Sirianni during the middle of the season. Coming out of an early bye week (Week 5), Sirianni focused on the attention to detail aspect of his football team -- having more physical practices during the week that concentrated on tackling and the basics of the game. The move paid off, as the Eagles lost one game the last of the season. The loss was a game which Jalen Hurts left with a concussion in the first quarter, the defense had five takeaways, and the Eagles lost in the final seconds. That's what it took to beat Philadelphia last season. Could this change back to padded practices on Wednesdays have a similar effect? ""Who said full pads? F--- off,"" Eagles left tackle Jordan Mailata said with a laugh over in the direction of Dean's locker. ""Let's be real. You guys got eyes out there. Half of us were in shirts, the others were in pants. ""It was a good physical practice. It was."" The Eagles took a lot of self reflection after a Giants loss where the physicality was in heavy favor of the Giants. Philadelphia is used to being the physically dominant team, but took one on the chin at MetLife Stadium last Thursday night. ""It's a good reminder,"" Mailata said. ""It's a physical game and we have to be the aggressor. We have to punch first."" Having the three days off helped the Eagles it down and ponder where they wanted their season to go, and what they have to do to get things back on track. ""It's always a good time to kinda reevaluate yourself,"" Dean said. ""Evaluate yourself as a team, as an individual, as a unit."" The message? That's subjective depending on the player, but attention to detail and getting back to being the more physical team was the main focus. This is what got the Eagles to have their most dominant run in franchise history, two separate win streaks to win 20 of 21 games. ""My attention moving forward is being the aggressor, be the player I've always been, and that's how I can help this team out,"" Mailata said. ""I kind of took the time to really think about how each of us can dominate our box and do our job then the rest will take care of itself. That's kind of the message I've been saying to our group. ""If we're in the gym, let's get a good workout in, let's put the work in. If we're on the field, let's get that work in and dominate. Just dominate our box."" The formula of having more physical practices has worked in the past. Sometimes it's better to go back to the old well. ""I see a group out there at practice that is flying around,"" said Eagles quarterback Jalen Hurts. ""Everybody's hungry. Everybody's in it.""",https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/eagles-make-a-change-to-get-winning-formula-back-on-track,Sport,cbssports.com,,https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2025/10/16/94332a77-10e9-48a7-824f-5f0a5e3841af/thumbnail/1200x675/aeb153953266674267855d843635ef53/gettyimages-2240442293.jpg,2025-10-16T15:57:00+00:00,f31bfb798c75ee275365249f5d8d2f9da9ce09fa

The firing of James Franklin could provide a psychological boost to a PSU squad that's been in a malaise for the last few weeks, while QB Drew Allar's season-ending injury should put more of Penn State's offensive focus on its run game. That's not a bad thing to lean on with a pair of future NFL running backs in Kaytron Allen and Nicholas Singleton. Iowa just allowed a season-high in rushing yards, and the Hawkeyes' offensive struggles are well documented as they haven't had a touchdown pass in three straight games. SportsLine's model has Penn State outgaining the Hawkeyes on Saturday and covering well over 50% of the time. See which other picks the model likes here . Another prediction: Missouri (-1.5, 43.5) covers against Auburn in over 70% of simulations Saturday at 7:45 p.m. ET. Mizzou suffered its first loss on Saturday, falling to Alabama, but the Tigers still covered and are 4-2 ATS this season. The Tigers of Auburn have covered just once over their last five games and have winless versus the spread at home (0-3). Missouri has incredible balance, with QB Beau Pribula leading the SEC in completion rate, while RB Ahmad Hardy tops the conference in rushing yards and touchdowns. Meanwhile, Auburn ranks 92nd in FBS in scoring as both its two lowest point totals and yardage totals have come in the last two games. With that Mizzou is projected to win outright by more than a touchdown, and the Over hits nearly 60% of the time. See the rest of the model's picks here .

Can you believe it? It felt like we learned plenty in Week 6. The New York Giants have a fun dynamic duo in Jaxson Dart and Cam Skattebo , while the Philadelphia Eagles and Buffalo Bills have some major question marks . The Kansas City Chiefs again look like the favorite in the AFC following their statement victory over the Detroit Lions , and the Carolina Panthers are apparently unbeatable at home. This week, Mike Vrabel makes his return to Nashville to face his former team, which just fired his replacement. The Los Angeles Rams take on the Jacksonville Jaguars in Trevor Lawrence's home away from home -- London. Plus, the Tampa Bay Buccaneers and Lions face off in a potential NFC Championship preview. Bet this week's top games at Bet365 Sportsbook , where new users get $200 in bonus bets using the bonus code CBSBET365 : Which teams should you pick in Week 7, and which should you fade? CBS Sports writers Jordan Dajani and Steven Taranto are here to break down the biggest games of the weekend. For clarity, lines for these selections were taken on Oct. 15, via FanDuel Sportsbook , where new users can get $300 in bonus bets : Dajani (Bengals +5.5): It's 40-year-old Aaron Rodgers vs. 40-year-old Joe Flacco in prime time on a short week. Take the Under. This is actually the first NFL matchup featuring 40-year-old quarterbacks that does not include Tom Brady and Drew Brees. While the Bengals have now lost four straight games, I think Flacco showed on a short week vs. the Green Bay Packers that he's going to be an upgrade over Jake Browning . I would be absolutely shocked to see Mike Tomlin lose this game, but I do think the Bengals can keep it close  … Prediction: Steelers 21, Bengals 17 Taranto (Steelers -5.5): The Unction is about where the intrigue in this matchup ends for me. Even if Joe Flacco can still sling it a bit and take advantage of having the Bengals' receiving corps to throw to, the Steelers are well on their way to running roughshod over the entire AFC North. The Standard has shown up throughout their three-game winning streak, which includes last week's manhandling of the Cleveland Browns in their first division game. That being said, I do expect at least a one-score game here as I don't expect Cincinnati to just roll over despite their (many) issues.  … Prediction: Steelers 24, Bengals 17 Los Angeles Rams (-3) at Jacksonville Jaguars (London) Dajani (Rams -3): The Jaguars have proven to be a feisty team, but NFL MVP candidate (not kidding, in my opinion) Devin Lloyd won't be available for this game, which really hurts. In a weird season defined by parity, I do believe the Rams are still one of the best teams in the NFL. They are the only team to rank top three in yards per play in both offense and defense, so give me Matthew Stafford … Prediction: Rams 24, Jaguars 18 Taranto (Rams -3): As the Brits would say, the Jaguars got caught feeling rough as a badger's arse against Seattle after the emotional high of beating the Chiefs in primetime -- Or, more simply put on this side of the pond, they were hung over from a huge win. The Jags will be on a national stage yet again with their annual game in London, but playing regularly in the UK doesn't give them an advantage against this specific opponent: Since Sean McVay took over as their coach, the Rams are 2-0 in games they've played in London, outscoring their opponents by a combined 57-10. … Prediction: Rams 27, Jaguars 17 Dajani (Patriots -7): Don't assume this is going to be the easiest pick of the week. Yes, the Titans stink and just fired their head coach, but since 2015, teams that fire their coach midseason are 12-12 in their next game. Titans owner Amy Adams Strunk is clearly hoping for that ""interim bump,"" but I can't bring myself to bet on this Titans squad. Mike Vrabel wants to embarrass Tennessee, but will do so respectfully  … Prediction: Patriots 27, Titans 17 Taranto (Titans +7): Do not discount the vibes boost that comes after a team fires its head coach. Since 2015, teams that have fired their coach midseason have gone 12-12 in the next game, though it should be noted that not all coach firings are created equally and exactly how the players rally and respond depends on how they felt about their coach to begin with. I still don't expect the Titans to be much of a match for the Patriots, but I do think that they'll show a little pride in the face of adversity -- especially with Mike Vrabel coming back to town … Prediction: Patriots 24, Titans 20 Dajani (Giants +7): It's tough not to love this new-look Giants team. Did you know Jaxson Dart is just the third quarterback in the modern era to rush for at least 50 yards in his first three starts? He joins a short list that includes Lamar Jackson and Jalen Hurts . I'm not sure what the disconnect is with Sean Payton and Bo Nix , but this offense has been hard to watch this year. Nix completed just 19 of 30 passes for 174 yards and one touchdown vs. the lowly New York Jets in London. For that reason, I'll take the Giants to cover a big number, which I don't quite understand  … Prediction: Broncos 24, Giants 20 Taranto (Giants +7): Remember a couple of days ago when everyone was on Giants defensive coordinator Shane Bowen for running a vanilla scheme and not catering to his players' strengths? Credit where credit is due, because Bowen has apparently listened to his players and started to get more aggressive, and that aggression played a big role in taking down the Eagles -- particularly on Cor'Dale Flott's interception that put the game away. Denver's defense presents a great challenge for the upstart Giants offense, but NFL sack leader Nik Bonitto hasn't reckoned yet with anyone like Giants left tackle Andrew Thomas , who is playing at an All-Pro level again and has allowed Jaxson Dart and Cam Skattebo to rejuvenate this team and make them feel like anything is possible. Including this week.  … Prediction: Giants 20, Broncos 13 Dajani (Cowboys +1.5): What do we make of the Cowboys? They are 1-1-1 with 104 points scored and zero turnovers in their last three games. Dak Prescott has thrown 10 touchdowns with zero interceptions over the last three weeks, and he's 34-9 SU and 30-12-1 ATS in his career vs. NFC East opponents. The Commanders are certainly feisty, but they gave away that game against the Chicago Bears with three turnovers. I expect plenty of points in this matchup, but give me the home dog  … Prediction: Cowboys 31, Commanders 30 Taranto (Commanders -1.5): Even if their offense is hard to stop, the Cowboys' comically bad defense renders them a paper tiger when it matters most. A week ago, the Panthers were the far tougher team when it mattered in the fourth quarter, as they were able to bully their way down the field to set up a chip-shot field goal to win the game. It's going to take a lot more than Dak Prescott throwing it all over the yard for this Dallas team to win consistently, especially against a Commanders team that's going to come into this matchup angry after giving the game away against the Bears on Monday night.  … Prediction: Commanders 37, Cowboys 34 Dajani (Falcons +2.5): It's hard to gauge what this 49ers team is since their roster has to leave games in ambulances half the time, but what I do know is that the Falcons are coming off a momentous victory over the Bills, and Fred Warner and Nick Bosa will not be on the field Sunday night. I'm tempted to take the Falcons straight up here. Brock Purdy could make his return to the lineup, but is he just going to hit the ground running? With Ricky Pearsall , Jauan Jennings and George Kittle banged up? Maybe Atlanta isn't a Super Bowl contender, but the Falcons are 2-0 SU as an underdog this season. And both of those games came in prime time!  … Prediction: Falcons 21, 49ers 20 Taranto (Falcons +2.5): It should not be undersold just how devastating Fred Warner's season-ending injury is. Since he entered the league in 2018, Warner has played in 121 of a possible 122 games, meaning there's only been one game that he hasn't manned the middle of the 49ers defense and done so at an extremely high level. His absence, combined with mounting attrition in general, bodes poorly for San Francisco. They face a Falcons team coming off a huge win over the Buffalo Bills, featuring a virtuoso performance by running back Bijan Robinson and exceptional play by wide receiver Drake London . Their offensive system will at least give them a chance, but the more banged up they get, the more I doubt they can sustain winning the way they have.  … Prediction: Falcons 27, 49ers 17 Tampa Bay Buccaneers at Detroit Lions (-5.5) (MNF) Dajani (Lions -5.5): Baker Mayfield is a legend, but can he win vs. a top five team despite all of the Bucs' injuries? I love the Buccaneers, but I think the Lions are arguably the best team in the NFC despite the most recent loss to the Chiefs. Detroit has won four straight meetings in prime time and has committed just three turnovers this season. I'm looking for a bounce-back, as Detroit is 11-0 SU and ATS following its past 11 SU losses, and has covered in six straight games as a favorite … Prediction : Lions 31, Buccaneers 24 Taranto (Buccaneers +5.5): This matchup presents a good case study in what attitude can do for a team one way or the other. The Buccaneers' toughness and resilience have been a central element in their 5-1 start, as Tampa Bay has followed the lead of quarterback Baker Mayfield in his emergence as a potential MVP candidate. The Lions' attitude got the better of them against Kansas City. They are now without one of their best players on defense, safety Brian Branch , after he started a fight following Detroit's 30-17 loss. Consider the impact of not having Branch and pick accordingly.  … Prediction: Buccaneers 31, Lions 20 Dajani (Texans +3.5): Many believe the Seahawks are one of the more underrated teams in the NFL. I am one of them. BUT... this team HATES playing in front of their home fans. Seattle is just 2-8 in its last 10 home games, and the Texans are not only coming off their bye, but also a 44-10 win over the injured Baltimore Ravens . If you're giving me the hook in this spot, I'll take it. This game could come down to the Texans defense vs. Sam Darnold . Houston is allowing 12.2 points per game this season, which ranks No. 1 in the NFL … Prediction: Seahawks 20, Texans 17 Taranto (Seahawks -3.5): Part of what's impressive about the Seahawks' 4-2 record is that they are a perfect 3-0 on the road to just 1-2 at home, which has given them a runway to figure out how to reclaim the home-field advantage they once enjoyed at Lumen Field. While the Seahawks have had issues winning in their own stadium going back to last year, it isn't as though they aren't scoring, as they blew out the New Orleans Saints 44-13 before losing a 38-35 shootout to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. This is a good opportunity for the Seahawks to get right and get a win at home in primetime, particularly against a Houston Texans team that is coming off their Bye and has gotten to 2-3 by beating up on the lowly Tennessee Titans and (shockingly) Baltimore Ravens. … Prediction: Seahawks 34, Texans 21",https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/nfl-week-7-betting-picks-predictions-odds,Sport,cbssports.com,,https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2025/10/16/04dcdc64-beb8-4fa3-b926-952cfec3730c/thumbnail/1200x675/624d4ca4597757449024295a18681716/jaxson-dart-giants-g.jpg,2025-10-16T15:45:22+00:00,71e9cfb5ab88d028f57c22f509972bf252c98fd2

61be09eacf0c,Spencer Rattler explains why losing Oklahoma QB job to Caleb Williams was 'blessing in disguise',"spencer rattler, caleb williams, oklahoma sooners, oklahoma qb, new orleans saints, chicago bears, nfl week 7","Almost exactly four years ago, Spencer Rattler was benched in favor of Caleb Williams as Oklahoma rallied for a comeback win over Texas. This weekend, those two will meet on the field in the NFL as Rattler's New Orleans Saints visit Williams' Chicago Bears . After Williams took over for the Sooners, they never looked back, and Rattler transferred to South Carolina that offseason. As fate would have it, Williams transferred, too, following coach Lincoln Riley to USC. Asked about losing his job to Williams in 2021, Rattler said it was a ""blessing"" because he got plenty of experience in two seasons at South Carolina, where he threw for 6,212 yards and 37 touchdowns. Those numbers rank fifth and sixth, respectively, in program history. ""I would say, yeah, that led me to South Carolina, and it was definitely a blessing in disguise that I got to play with the Gamecocks, develop there and get ready to go to the league after that,"" Rattler said. After the two went their separate ways, Williams went on to win the Heisman Trophy with the Trojans, and he was the No. 1 overall pick in the 2024 NFL Draft . In that same draft, Rattler waited until the fifth round to hear his name called. Rattler said the whole experience taught him a valuable lesson in overcoming adversity, which also helps him on the field. ""How to deal with adversity,"" Rattler said. ""It's not the first time a quarterback had to go through that, so I'm not the only one. Adversity, it's the quarterback position. It's what comes with the job. You've got to deal with it and move on to the next."" Rattler said that while he and Williams haven't spoken much since the 2021 season in Norman, they are ""cordial"" with each other. That may not be the case once the Saints and Bears kick off at 1 p.m. ET on Sunday afternoon.",https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/spencer-rattler-explains-why-losing-oklahoma-qb-job-caleb-williams-blessing-in-disguise,Sport,cbssports.com,,https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2025/10/16/993fa43e-8955-467a-be63-82b25f29c2ff/thumbnail/1200x675/a02cca5cc640af38748ef6ff1e43ce70/gettyimages-1236686050-2.jpg,2025-10-16T15:42:00+00:00,98e6a5a0d34b1f12d5d46f5f55b1c4a8a9d7160f

A great example of a ""spot"" play is Vanderbilt's upset over Alabama last season. The Commodores were returning home after two straight road losses, while Alabama was coming off an emotional win over No. 2 Georgia . Vanderbilt won the game outright as a 23-point underdog. We will see more opportunities like this once the season gets going based on travel, results, and injuries. Just for clarification, I'll always mention if I bet the game personally. Sometimes, I will like the spot for a certain team but my numbers may not see enough value to make it an official play. Here are three strong betting spots for Week 8. Ole Miss +7.5 vs. Georgia Last week, we saw the epitome of a lookahead spot. Ole Miss was coming off a bye week and hosted lowly Washington State before facing Georgia. Which team do you think the Rebels were more focused on during their week off? This week, Ole Miss is on the opposite end of the spectrum and in a good spot getting over a touchdown at Georgia. The Rebels were lucky to get by the Cougars at home but now I think we will see a different team on Saturday. The good thing about Ole Miss almost getting upset is this line is probably a little higher than it should be between two teams I have rated closely in my power rankings. I make Georgia -6 at home. This isn't the Georgia of a few years ago where it hammers most opponents. The Bulldogs grind out wins in the SEC now. They beat Tennessee by three, lost to Alabama by three and defeated Auburn by 10 in a game that was tight the entire way. I see another competitive game on Saturday against a good Ole Miss squad. Georgia's defense is playing much better than it did early in the season. However, I'm still sold on an offense that scored a total of 41 points against Alabama and Auburn. I think this game goes down to the fourth quarter and Ole Miss can stay within the 7.5. UCLA -3.5 vs. Maryland Maryland is in one of the worst spots of the season. The Terps are coming off two excruciating losses at home and now travel across the country to face a rejuvenated UCLA squad. Two weeks ago, Maryland blew a 20-0 lead against Washington and lost 24-20. Last week, the Terps led Nebraska 31-24 heading into the fourth quarter but gave up 10 straight points and lost when the Cornhuskers scored a touchdown with 1:08 left in the game. UCLA has come to life under interim coach Tim Skipper. The Bruins scored 42 and 38 points in back-to-back wins over Penn State and Michigan State . I was impressed with UCLA last week when they were in a tough spot coming off the big win over Penn State. The Bruins went on the road and toasted Michigan State 38-13 as 8.5-point underdogs. Maryland is a young team, so we will see how it responds coming off two tough losses at home. Add in the travel across the country and UCLA -3.5 is one of the better spot plays of the season heading into Week 8. Stanford +17.5 vs. Florida State Stanford isn't a good football team, although it is catching Florida State at the right time. The Seminoles are coming off three straight losses and now have to travel across the country to face the lowly Cardinal. You have to wonder where the players are mentally right now and how they will respond after their latest loss to Pitt. Stanford isn't explosive on offense and the Cardinal depend on long, time consuming drives to score. That could actually benefit the Cardinal on Saturday. If they can shorten the game and limit Florida State's possessions, I think Stanford can stay within 17.5 points. The other thing to consider here is the Seminoles are really struggling defensively. Florida State has allowed 108 points in losses to Virginia , Miami and Pitt. The Seminoles gave up an average of 154 rushing yards and 264 passing yards in the three games. Stanford's offense should be able to move the ball here. The Cardinal have actually looked like a competent football team at home, going 2-0 and scoring 30 points in wins over Boston College and San Jose State . While Florida State represents a step up in class, this is a good situational spot to back Stanford getting 17.5 points.",https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/news/college-football-betting-expert-eyes-ole-miss-ucla-among-best-week-8-spots-to-target,Sport,cbssports.com,,https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2025/10/15/d9c9fe59-9a17-4a6e-acdc-c48cc8966784/thumbnail/1200x675/ea3984dc57c33484fa3faa67e8dc0a84/trinidad-chambliss-ole-miss.png,2025-10-16T15:40:43+00:00,6a663b09cad1d143aca32258b864dfb65c46d78c

5a526b8c666c,"Ranking top 10 NFL offseason acquisitions: Daniel Jones, Sam Darnold putting up MVP seasons","daniel jones, sam darnold, micah parsons, nfl trades, nfl signings","The focus on the NFL Draft is so intense that one can make a living talking and writing about it 365 days a year. That's understandable given how drafting well is the lifeblood for any NFL franchise to remain a Super Bowl contender consistently for years to come, but teams also need to hit on their swings in free agency in order to get over the hump to grab the Vince Lombardi trophy. The Super Bowl LIX champion Philadelphia Eagles used the free agency signing of Pro Bowl running back Saquon Barkley to win it all last season after he erupted for a historic 2,005 rushing yards en route to earning 2024 NFL Offensive Player of the Year honors. So who are the most impactful veteran additions of the 2025 season through the first third, six weeks, of the current NFL season? Let's take a closer look at the 10 greatest hits early on this year. Transaction: Two-year, $11 million contract  ($8 million guaranteed) While the Vikings are still unsettled at the quarterback position, beginning the year with 2024 10th overall pick quarterback J.J. McCarthy and cycling to journeyman Carson Wentz , defensive coordinator Brian Flores and his defense just keep on chugging along as one of the better units in football. One of the reasons why Minnesota ranks as a top five defense is because of their free agency acquisition of former Indianapolis Colts and Philadelphia Eagles cornerback Isaiah Rodgers. His 36.3 passer rating allowed as the primary defender in coverage stands as the fourth-best in the NFL among 122 players with at least 20 passes thrown their way this season, per TruMedia. PPG allowed 19.4 5th Total YPG allowed 289.8 6th Yards/play 4.9 8th QB pressure rate 43.7% 2nd Blitz rate 38% 2nd Pass YPG allowed 157.6 2nd Transaction: Three-year, $43.5 million contract  ($26 million guaranteed) The New England Patriots are in first place in the AFC East for the first time in years: they're experiencing their best six-game start to a season (4-2) since Tom Brady's last season in Foxborough in 2019 when New England started 6-0. One of the driving reasons for this hot start is the Patriots having a top 10 scoring defense (20 points per game allowed, seventh-best in the NFL). They've been great at stopping the run, 83.5 rushing yards per game allowed this season (fourth-best in the NFL), and they signed one of the better edge rushers in the league in free agency in Harold Landry III. His 4.5 sacks are tied for the eighth-most in football while his 25 quarterback pressures are tied for the 12th-most in the league. Landry is one of seven players with at least 25 quarterback pressures and 4.5 sacks this season along with Nik Bonitto , Byron Young , Aidan Hutchinson , Tuli Tuipulotu , Jeffery Simmons and Jonathan Cooper . 8. New England Patriots sign WR Stefon Diggs Transaction: Three-year, $63.5 million contract  ($22.6 million guaranteed) Patriots quarterback Drake Maye has made the leap in Year 2. He ranks top 10 in the league in completion percentage (73.2%, second in the NFL), passing yards (1,522, fifth in the NFL ), passing yards per attempt (8.5, fourth in the NFL) and passer rating (112.5, fourth ). He also helped power his Patriots to one of the signature victories of the 2025 season, upsetting the then-undefeated, 4-0 Bills and 2024 NFL MVP quarterback Josh Allen in Buffalo on ""Sunday Night Football"" 23-20 in Week 5. Maye has certainly benefitted from the additions of four-time Pro Bowl wide receiver Stefon Diggs and offensive coordinator Josh McDaniels in 2025. One could argue Diggs is the primary factor for his rise given Maye's 86.5% completion percentage (32/37) targeting Diggs is the highest completion percentage in the NFL among 51 duos with at least 30 targets between them in 2025, according to CBS Sports Research. Completion Percentage 73.2% 2nd Pass Yards 1,522 5th Pass Yards/Attempt 8.5 4th Pass TD 10 T-9th Passer Rating 112.5 4th Expected Points Added (EPA)/Play 0.10 10th Transaction: One-year, $3 million contract The Dallas Cowboys are off to an underwhelming 2-3-1 start to the 2025 season, but it's not because of their offense. First-year head coach Brian Schottenheimer's attack is the league's No.3 scoring offense (29.7 points per game) and the league's No. 1 total offense (387.5 total yards per game). Quarterback Dak Prescott is obviously a critical reason why , but so too is new bell cow running back Javonte Williams. The 25-year-old profiles as a top-five running back in football as a Cowboy, looking much refreshed after a gruesome knee injury in 2022 with the Denver Broncos that appeared to derail his football career. Carries 92 T-8th Rush Yards 476 4th Yards Per Carry 5.2 9th Rush TD 5 T-3rd Rushing First Downs 26 T-3rd First Downs per Carry 28.3% 4th* Rush Yards After Contact 352 5th Scrimmage TD 6 T-2nd * Among 27 players with at least 65 carries this season Transaction: One-year, $2.75 million contract On paper, it would appear that Williams, Dowdle's successor as Dallas' lead running back, is off to a better start to 2025 than Dowdle. However, Dowdle has only had two weeks as Carolina's lead back with Chuba Hubbard (calf) missing the last two weeks. His production across Week 5 vs. the Miami Dolphins (206 yards rushing and a touchdown on 23 carries; 28 receiving yards on 3 catches) and Week 6 vs. the Cowboys (183 yards rushing on 30 carries; 56 receiving yards on 4 catches) is historic. Dowdle's 273 yards from scrimmage the last two weeks are the most in a player's first two starts with a team since the 1970 AFL/NFL merger, according to CBS Sport Research. Add in how he challenged Dallas to ""buckle up"" before he ran them over for 183 yards , and he gets the slight edge early on over Williams. Carries 81 19th Rush Yards 472 5th Yards Per Carry 5.8 4th Rushing First Downs 22 T-9th First Downs per Carry 27.2% 7th* Rush Yards After Contact 316 7th Scrimmage Yards 576 6th Scrimmage TD 3 T-15th * Among 27 players with at least 65 carries this season 5. Dallas Cowboys trade for WR George Pickens Transaction: Traded 2026 third-round pick and 2027 fifth-round pick to the Pittsburgh Steelers for Pickens, 2027 sixth-round pick Cowboys owner and general manager Jerry Jones said the following on Tuesday : ""Certainly [George] Pickens is playing outstanding."" That's a cold hard fact: Pickens' six receiving touchdowns are tied with the Detroit Lions ' Amon-Ra St. Brown atop the NFL this season, and Pickens' 525 receiving yards rank third in the league. His six receiving touchdowns are also tied for the most receiving touchdowns (six) in a player's first six games with the Cowboys since the 1970 AFL/NFL merger along with Amari Cooper , according to CBS Sports Research. Pickens has been so good that Dallas hasn't felt All-Pro No. 1 option CeeDee Lamb's absence (out with an ankle sprain) the last three weeks. That's miraculous. 4. Pittsburgh Steelers sign QB Aaron Rodgers Transaction: One-year, $13.6 million contract The Pittsburgh Steelers bungled the primes of 2021 NFL Defensive Player of the Year edge rusher T.J. Watt and seven-time Pro Bowl defensive tackle Cameron Heyward the prior three years (2022-2024) by wandering through the quarterback wilderness post-Ben Roethlisberger with Kenny Pickett , Justin Fields and Russell Wilson . There's a reason why Pickens was having regular outbursts in Pittsburgh: he was obviously frustrated by passers who couldn't consistently get him the football. Aaron Rodgers being able to play like a borderline top 10 quarterback at the age 41 -- his 105.4 passer rating in 2025 is the 8th-best in the NFL -- in tandem with the Steelers' talented defense is why Pittsburgh is out to a 4-1 start in 2025, good for a stranglehold of first place in the AFC North early on. Rodgers' 10 touchdown passes in just five games this season are already the second-most by a Steelers quarterback in a single season since 2022. That's a glaring indictment on Pickett, Fields and Wilson, and a clear demonstration of how valuable Rodgers is to Pittsburgh simply by playing solid football by his lofty, future Hall of Fame career standards. Russell Wilson (2024) 16 11 Aaron Rodgers (2025) 10 5 Kenny Pickett (2022) 7 13 Kenny Pickett (2023) 6 12 Justin Fields (2024) 5 10 * Quarterback Ben Roethlisberger retired after the 2021 season Transactions: Traded DT Kenny Clark and two first-round picks to Dallas Cowboys for Parsons, re-signed him on four-year, $186M extension Through five games played this season, the Green Bay Packers (3-1-1) are the NFC's No. 2 seed, and their defense is a strong reason why thanks to the addition of All-Pro edge rusher Micah Parsons. Parsons, who held out of training camp as a Cowboys in an effort to get a long-term extension, still ranks tied for fourth in the league in quarterback pressures (29) despite Green Bay being on their bye week in Week 5. Packers Pro Bowl edge rusher Rashan Gary is on pace to shatter his single-season career high for sacks of 9.5 after racking up 4.5, tied for the eighth-most in the NFL despite the Week 5 bye. One of the reasons Jerry Jones used to justify trading Parsons for Clark and two first-round picks was in order to bolster Dallas' run defense. Green Bay has the NFL's No. 1 run defense with Parsons on their defensive line. The Packers would do the trade for the 26-year-old Parsons and his subsequent extension 10 times out of 10. PPG allowed 20.4 10th Total YPG allowed 280.2 5th Yards per play allowed 4.4 2nd Rush YPG allowed 73.0 1st Third down conversion rate allowed 34.3% 6th QB pressure rate 39.8% 10th Time to throw allowed 2.73 seconds 6th Pass yards per attempt allowed 5.5 1st Transaction: Three-year, $100.5 million contract ($55 million guaranteed) Not much was expected of the Seattle Seahawks after they traded away two-time Pro Bowl quarterback Geno Smith to the Las Vegas Raiders and signed journeyman, former top five pick Sam Darnold in free agency. The Seahawks had +500 odds to win the NFC West in the preseason, per Sports Odds History , the lowest in the division. The Vegas sportsbooks felt Seattle was going to finish last in their division in 2025 with Darnold as their quarterback. Instead, Seattle is off to a 4-2 start in 2025, which is tied with the San Francisco 49ers and the Los Angeles Rams for the division's top record through the first third of the season. That's in large part because the Seahawks have the NFL's No. 5 scoring offense (27.7 points per game) with Darnold at the controls. He leads the entire NFL in pass yards per attempt with a 9.6 average, the fifth-highest in the first six games of a season in the last 35 seasons, minimum 150 pass attempts per CBS Sports Research. Darnold's deep passing prowess has unlocked former first-round pick wide receiver Jaxson Smith-Njigba as a result: Smith-Njigba leads the NFL with 696 yards receiving this season with 42 catches, tied for the fifth-most in the league this year, on 56 targets, tied for the fifth-most in the league this year. The last player with as many receiving on that low of a target total through six games was the receiving G.O.A.T. Jerry Rice in 1986 with 723 yards receiving on 55 targets, per CBS Sports Research. The Seahawks' new franchise quarterback is also just the sixth quarterback averaging a completion percentage over 70% (70.8, seventh in the NFL) and over 9.5 yards per pass attempt (9.6, the best in the NFL) through the first six games of a season since the 1970 AFL/NFL merger, minimum 100 pass attempts. That's pretty, pretty good considering the first two quarterbacks to accomplish the feat -- Hall of Famer Kurt Warner in 1999 and future Hall of Famer Aaron Rodgers in 2011 -- went on to win NFL MVP honors in their respective such seasons. Sam Darnold (SEA) 2025 Tua Tagovailoa (MIA) 2023 Russell Wilson (SEA) 2021 Aaron Rodgers (GB) 2011* Kurt Warner (STL) 1999* * Won NFL MVP 1. Indianapolis Colts sign QB Daniel Jones Transaction: One-year, $14 million contract Indianapolis Colts quarterback Daniel Jones is tied with Los Angeles Chargers Pro Bowl quarterback Justin Herbert for the eighth-best NFL MVP odds in the 2025 season through six weeks of play, according to FanDuel Sportsbook . With a 5-1 record, the Colts are the AFC's No. 1 seed through six weeks. Reading the previous two sentences a month and a half ago would have resulted in an immediate drug test. How insane is Jones' 2025 season? He's already thrown eight touchdowns, which is the same number he had in 10 starts with the New York Giants in 2024, and Jones is currently producing career-highs in both passer rating (104.4) and completion percentage (71.7%) that are both way above his prior career highs of a 67.5% completion percentage in 2023 and a 92.5 passer rating in 2022. Jones is genuinely performing like a top 10 to top 5 quarterback across the board this season, which is a surreal statement given the Giants dumped him midseason last year after six years of underperforming his sixth overall pick draft status from 2019. New York was well justified in doing so, but with the Colts, Jones is thriving. Completion percentage 71.7% 3rd Pass yards 1,502 7th Pass yards per attempt 8.3 5th Total TD 12 T-6th Passer rating 104.4 10th Sacks 5 1st Sack rate 2.7% 1st Expected Points Added (EPA) per play 0.34 1st It probably helps that Jones' five sacks taken through six games are the fewest by Jones through the first six games of a season in his career: the 2025 Indianapolis offensive line is the best of his seven-year career. He's rewarding their play with potentially All-Pro production.",https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/ranking-top-10-nfl-offseason-acquisitions-daniel-jones-sam-darnold,Sport,cbssports.com,,https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2025/09/28/9bcfd18a-88f9-45ae-8ca8-9ed930d900cf/thumbnail/1200x675/a245bc6231d301450e411bbd549c2bcd/gettyimages-2237946092.jpg,2025-10-16T15:37:58+00:00,d98047c2cc2346cf96d5fd2276edfbf37f8eab9a
d47bad9fd424,Rookie quarterback Cam Ward reveals what he's looking for in the Titans' next coach,,"Getty Images The Tennessee Titans became the first NFL team to fire their coach this season, as they parted ways with Brian Callahan following a 1-5 start. The Callahan era was an abject disaster, as the Titans went 4-19 under his leadership. However, all of those losses did net Tennessee a new quarterback in Cam Ward . Ward hasn't lit the NFL world on fire just yet, but he has flashed some of the potential that led to him being selected with the top pick in the 2025 NFL Draft . Ward is hardly the first young quarterback to go through a coaching change, as each of the last four quarterbacks picked No. 1 overall had their coaches fired during their rookie seasons. What does Ward want to see in his new coach? The rookie signal-caller was asked that question on Wednesday. ""Somebody who can really do everything from top to bottom, and that's both sides of the ball -- offense, defense,"" Ward said. ""They know the system in and out, and I think the biggest thing is how is the coach going to be with the players. We have all different types of personalities in our locker room and whoever we get, I know they'll be the right hire, but that's not really my main focus right now. I'm with coach [Mike] McCoy right now and we're going to try to win some games."" It sounds like Ward would appreciate a coach that has served as a lead man before, and that's something many believe Tennessee will look for as well: Experience. According to NFL Media's Ian Rapoport , two names to watch for the Titans job are Kansas City Chiefs offensive coordinator Matt Nagy and Pittsburgh Steelers offensive coordinator Arthur Smith. Both have served as head coaches before. Nagy even won NFL Coach of the Year with the Chicago Bears in 2018, while Smith is a very familiar name to Titans fans, as he cut his teeth as an offensive assistant in Nashville. Senior offensive assistant Mike McCoy has been named the interim head coach in Tennessee, and you can't rule out him earning the full-time job either. The last three interim coaches in franchise history ended up keeping the job.",https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/rookie-quarterback-cam-ward-reveals-what-hes-looking-for-in-the-titans-next-coach,Sport,cbssports.com,,https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2025/10/16/20703251-da0c-4340-bc05-d513c58e4a17/thumbnail/1200x675/e1c64771ba9ce89523ba79387497dac1/cam.jpg,2025-10-16T15:34:57+00:00,93d15846e5660dab1ef0965472bf7405f2c14352

Patriots vs. Titans sees New England on the road for the third straight week, and the Pats, led by former Tennessee coach Mike Vrabel, are 7-point favorites as they look to complete this road trip 3-0. Additionally, the Chiefs fans will get to see their team take part in a 1 p.m. ET kickoff for the only time in the first 11 weeks of the 2025 NFL season. Kansas City is an 11.5-point home favorite, the largest on the board, per the latest Week  NFL odds, as they host the Raiders. Then, a Monday night doubleheader sees the Texans visiting the Seahawks in the nightcap at 10 p.m. ET. This is just the second time in the last 20 years that the Texans will play at Seattle, with the home team favored by 3.5 points. Detroit is -5.5 against the Bucs in the first Monday game.

Philly is coming off a mini-bye after playing last Thursday, but Minnesota is coming off a full bye after covering versus Cleveland in Week 5. Covering, or winning, isn't something that the Eagles have done recently as they're 0-2 both against the spread and straight up over their last two games. The Philly offense is in shambles as its two lowest point totals over the last calendar year have come in its two most recent contests. Since the start of last year, Minnesota has the second-best spread record overall (14-8-1), as well as the second-best spread record at home (7-3). As for the Eagles, they haven't shown a tendency to bounce back versus the line after outright defeats, which is what they're coming off with a Thursday loss to the Giants. Philadelphia is only 3-7 against the spread after a straight-up loss since the start of the 2023 season. The model has Minnesota prevailing versus the spread over 50% of the time. See which other teams to pick here . Another one of its Week 7 NFL predictions: the Broncos (-7, 40.5) cover versus the Giants in well over 50% of simulations in an A-rated pick. Bo Nix is a perfect 6-0 against the spread versus NFC opponents in his career and is also 7-1 versus the line as a home favorite. A big part of that is Denver having the most ferocious pass rush the NFL has possibly ever seen. Last year, Denver's 63 sacks were the most in the league and the second-most by any team over the last two decades. This year, Denver is on pace for an NFL record of 85 sacks which would shatter the record of 72 set by the 1984 Chicago Bears. Now, the Broncos get to face a rookie quarterback in Jaxson Dart who gets sacked at the ninth-highest rate in the league. Dart has looked impressive at home but had three turnovers in his lone road start at New Orleans, which was both a defeat and a spread loss for New York. After taking down one New York quarterback in Justin Fields nine times in Week 6, Denver is projected to take down another, in Dart, at least five times on Sunday, as the Broncos are forecasted to win by double-digits. The model also says the Over hits almost 60% of the time. See which other teams to pick here .

Top Week 7 Fantasy football picks One surprise in Week 7: The model is fading Eagles quarterback Jalen Hurts, the reigning Super Bowl MVP who ranks fourth in positional Fantasy points this year. Much of Hurts' Fantasy production has come from the ground but he's had just 15 total rushing yards over the last two weeks and is averaging his fewest rushing yards per game in five years. Then there's what Hurt has done, or hasn't done, as a passer as he's part of the 29th-ranked passing offense in the league. Hurts ranks just 26th in passing yards per game and is tied for 25th in passing touchdowns per game. On Sunday, he'll have to face possibly the best pass defense in the league as the Vikings have allowed the second-fewest yards through the air and the fourth-fewest passing touchdowns. Only two teams have given up fewer Fantasy points to quarterbacks than Minnesota, and with Hurts ranking outside the top 12 in Week 7 Fantasy football QB rankings, he may not warrant a spot in lineups. Another curveball: The model is high on Chargers running back Kimani Vidal. With Najee Harris first exiting the lineup, and then Omarion Hampton doing the same, Vidal is the next man up in Los Angeles' backfield. He didn't disappoint in his first career start in Week 6 as he ran 18 times for 124 yards while adding 14 yards and a score through the air. He also dominated the time share in L.A.'s backfield with more than twice as many snaps (43) as backup Hassan Haskins (20). The Chargers rank third in yards per rush attempt, so whomever lines up in their backfield seems destined for success. Vidal and L.A. will take on the Colts on Sunday, and Indy ranks 19th in yards per carry allowed. Five of the six starting RBs that Indianapolis has faced have either 94-plus scrimmage yards or a touchdown in 2025. Vidal is a top-15 Fantasy running back this week, making him a must-start in all sized leagues.

An exact release date has not been set. This marks the second collaboration between Soderbergh and Neon after “Presence,” a psychological thriller that debuted earlier this year. Soderbergh is also known for “Ocean’s 11,” “Contagion,” “Erin Brockovich,” “Traffic” and “Sex, Lies and Videotapes.” His latest directorial effort, “The Christophers,” stars Ian McKellen, Michaela Coel, Jessica Gunning and James Corden. McKellen plays aging artist Julian Sklar who hasn’t painted in decades and has been broke for years. His two estranged children (Corden and Gunning), desperate for his inheritance, hire an art forger (Coel) to complete a key project from his past. “The Christophers” debuted at the Toronto International Film Festival to rave reviews, with Variety’s chief film critic Peter Debruge describing the story as a “crackling original drama” and praising McKellen and Coel as “two top-notch English actors of wildly different backgrounds and styles at the top of their respective games.” Neon will represent international sales of “The Christophers.” Department M produced and financed the film, which was written by Ed Solomon (“No Sudden Move”). The deal was negotiated by Alison Cohen on behalf of Neon with CAA Media Finance on behalf of the filmmakers. Also out of TIFF, Neon nabbed U.S. rights to the music documentary “Baz Luhrmann’s EPiC: Elvis Presley in Concert.” Over the next few months, the independent studio will release Jafar Panahi’s Palme d’Or winner “It Was Just an Accident,” Joachim Trier’s “Sentimental Value” and Park Chan-wook’s “No Other Choice.”",https://variety.com/2025/film/news/steven-soderbergh-the-christophers-neon-2026-release-1236554576,Entertainment,variety.com,Rebecca Rubin,https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/The-Christophers-Still-Photo-credit-Claudette-Barius.jpg?w=1000&h=563&crop=1,2025-10-16T16:45:00+00:00,e0750fdbd9d7fdd5b27be75da42eb32da5fc687b

But when the village’s well mysteriously dries up, only she is small enough to descend into the belly of the earth to investigate and bring the water of life back to her people. The film has already won the Satoshi Kon Award for Excellence in Animation (Best Short Film – Silver) at Fantasia International Film Festival.

5879f749bae3,"Big Thief on ‘Double Infinity,’ the Band ‘Breakup’ and Rejecting ‘Icky’ Opportunities: ‘What People Want Is the Very Thing They Ask You to Sacrifice’",,"It’s often said that Big Thief functions like a four-headed organism. Gathered at a picnic table in a Brooklyn park, the members of the folk-rock outfit cross limbs and finish each other’s sentences, weaving their thoughts into a long-winded quilt. At one point, singer Adrianne Lenker looks across the table at guitarist Alexander “Buck” Meek and says, “Alexander,” communicating in one word that she wants him to remove his blue-tinted biker glasses so she can see his eyes. Message received. So last year, when the band “broke up” with bassist Max Oleartchik, chopping off one of those heads, Big Thief didn’t wallow in his absence but rather expanded, becoming something else entirely. For their sixth album, “Double Infinity,” the band invited 10 additional musicians into the studio, including percussionists, vocalists, jazz players and New Age artist Laraaji. The album preserves Big Thief ’s earthy, country-tinged sound but injects it with tapestried rhythms and an exotic flair. “We wanted to push into the change and not hold on to something that isn’t there,” says drummer James Krivchenia, clad in a torn-up blue hoodie and Lennon-esque sunglasses. The result is a strange and sometimes fascinating album, where Lenker’s delicate warble floats above drones, tape loops and Laraaji’s wordless chanting. On “Words,” Meek breaks into a frenetic solo, warping his instrument into a sped-up, distorted sitar. And replacing Oleartchik as Big Thief ’s touring bassist is Joshua Crumbly, whose hypnotizing groove anchors “No Fear.” But is Oleartchik’s departure a permanent one, or might he return at some point? “I don’t know,” Lenker says, covering her eyes with Meek’s sunglasses. After a brief pause, her two bandmates chime in: “It feels pretty permanent.” “I mean, it feels permanent,” she agrees. “It’s just weird to say.” Big Thief recorded “Double Infinity” in the winter, reveling in daily bike rides from Brooklyn to a Hell’s Kitchen studio in the icy cold. It was important to them to tape “Double Infinity” in New York, the city where, more than a decade ago, Lenker met Meek, fell in love and formed a band that has outlasted their marriage. (The song “Los Angeles” traces their larger-than-labels relationship over the years.) In the early days, the duo slept on a concrete floor in a “slumlord artist house” in Bushwick. Lenker had a job on the Upper West Side polishing silverware, and Meek worked as a bike courier. They saved up $3,500 to buy a van they named Bonnie and routed tours across the East Coast, performing in dive bars and backyards. Lenker says they lost money on most of those shows, “but I always felt so rich.” “It didn’t matter if we were playing in a basement and the microphones broke, or we didn’t have a guitar because our instruments broke, or our van broke,” Lenker recalls. “We, come hell or high water, would play music. It’s something that can’t be destroyed.” “Connecting with the infinite,” she adds, “nobody can take that away.” After years of critically beloved albums, nonstop touring and a couple surprise indie hits, Big Thief is now on their biggest tour yet, having just performed at the Hollywood Bowl and looking ahead to Forest Hills Stadium. But as bands become popular, they also become businesses. Lenker says it’s their job to “protect the heart at the center of our music.” That means three-hour meetings every Monday in which the band discuss potential opportunities, shooting down the ones that feel “icky.” Imitating a ninja with an invisible sword, she says it feels like “slicing energies” away. Big Thief has weathered algorithmic forces and avoided the “commodification” of their music. They’ve turned down licensing offers — like a Levi’s commercial — as well as brand partnerships. Meek says Harley Davidson once offered to follow the band with a film crew as they rode motorcycles from California to South by Southwest. “Driving through the desert, wind in our hair, it sounded fun,” Meek says. “But hell no.” “What people want is the very thing they ask you to sacrifice,” Lenker says. “The thing that draws people to you in the first place, you’re given every opportunity to give that thing up.” “I’ve seen a lot of people lose touch,” Meek adds. “We want to be making records and playing shows together for the rest of our lives. We put a lot of thought into protecting that.” He stops, looks across the table and playfully snatches his sunglasses back from Lenker.",https://variety.com/2025/music/news/big-thief-double-infinity-rejecting-brand-partnerships-1236551791,Entertainment,variety.com,Ethan Shanfeld,https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/bigthief.png?crop=91px%2C53px%2C739px%2C415px&resize=1000%2C563,2025-10-16T16:15:00+00:00,c05d07514cb4a9832c8e423677a9354bcde5567b
25095cc28339,Dwayne Johnson and Benny Safdie’s ‘Lizard Music’ Lands at Amazon MGM Studios’ United Artists,,"Dwayne Johnson and Benny Safdie ‘s next collaboration, a movie titled “Lizard Music” — which sees Johnson as a 70-year-old called “Chicken Man” with a 111-year-old chicken named Claudia as his closest companion — has landed at Amazon MGM Studios’ United Artists . Safdie is directing and wrote the script, based on the Daniel Pinkwater novel of the same name. UA and Scott Stuber landed the hot project in a competitive situation. “We are so thrilled to partner once again with extraordinarily talented Dwayne Johnson, as well as work for the first time with the amazing creator, writer and director Benny Safdie, on ‘Lizard Music,'” stated Courtenay Valenti, head of film, streaming and theatrical for Amazon MGM. “Everyone at Amazon MGM and UA is deeply inspired by their previous collaboration on the critically acclaimed ‘The Smashing Machine.’ We are so excited to now collaborate with them on this imaginative, entertaining and cinematic story; ‘Lizard Music’ is a tale that feels both timeless and unique. We are very fortunate that they have trusted us to be their studio partners.” The film will follow a boy opens a “hidden door to the extraordinary” when he “stumbles upon a secret late-night broadcast of lizards playing otherworldly music,” an early synopsis explains. “His search for answers leads him to the eccentric and whimsical septuagenarian Chicken Man, and his beloved companion, a 111-year-old chicken named Claudia — two kindred spirits who found each other at just the right time. United by this shared vision, they set off on an adventure that begins as a hunt for a hidden society but blossoms into something far greater: a voyage through invisible worlds, unexpected harmonies and the unbreakable bond between lost souls who discover magic not only in what they find, but in each other.” In his statement, Safdie shared that he’d read Pinkwater’s “Lizard Music” to his two sons. “We were riveted by its imagination and wonder,” the filmmaker said. “I love Daniel Pinkwater as a person and an author; the idea of making a movie where everyone can join the conversation is both thrilling and beautiful. To go on this adventure with Dwayne and to be able to watch him transform and become the Chicken Man is just beyond… I can’t wait!” Stuber will produce the film alongside UA’s Nick Nesbitt, Safdie (for his Out for the Count Productions), Johnson (for his Seven Bucks Productions) and Magnetic Fields Entertainment’s David Koplan. “I’ve been lucky enough to work with Dwayne and Benny on multiple projects and have seen firsthand their incredible talents and connection as artists,” Stuber said. “The world they’ve created together for ‘Lizard Music’ is unlike anything either has done before, and we couldn’t be more excited to bring this wonderfully imaginative story to life.” News of the forthcoming project broke amid Johnson and Safie’s press tour for “The Smashing Machine,” as the wrestler-turned-actor appeared noticeably thinner on the red carpet. (He’d packed on 30 lbs to play MMA fighter Mark Kerr for that film and delivered a performance which is garnering Oscar buzz.) In interviews , including with Variety’s Marc Malkin , Johnson explained that his fluctuating appearance was preparation for his next movie. “I’ve been dieting,” Johnson said at the film’s Los Angeles premiere. “Happy to not be carrying all the weight. I’m able to tuck in my shirt now…I don’t look pregnant so it’s all good.” About the character’s final look, he added: “Think Clint Eastwood at 75. Sinewy muscles, he’s lean.”",https://variety.com/2025/film/news/dwayne-johnson-benny-safdie-lizard-music-united-artists-1236554193,Entertainment,variety.com,Angelique Jackson,https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2239856627-e1760573019791.jpg?crop=0px%2C56px%2C1905px%2C1073px&resize=1000%2C563,2025-10-16T16:15:00+00:00,e41641d451cea176d4431177ced170b6ccd3bb3c
cfb7d13e8bd5,"‘Wicked’: How ‘For Good’s Story of Friendship Resonates With Jon M. Chu, Alice Brooks and Myron Kerstein in Real Life",,"It seems fitting that this year’s Creative Collaborator award recipients, Jon M. Chu , cinematographer Alice Brooks and editor Myron Kerstein, are part of the team who brought “ Wicked ” and its sequel, “Wicked: For Good,” to the big screen. The film is a story about friendship and Chu, who has known Brooks since their days as film students at USC, says, “It is really even more full-circle to be making a movie like this and explore friendship with my friends.” “Wicked” is the story of the witches of Oz before “The Wizard of Oz.” Next month, “Wicked: For Good” brings the story to a close as the friendship of Glinda (Ariana Grande) and Elphaba (Cynthia Erivo) is put to the test. The Creative Collaborators Award will be presented at the Middleburg Film Festival on Oct. 17. The festival runs from Oct. 16 – 19 . Variety talked to the honorees about working together on several films, including “Wicked: For Good.” ‘Crazy Rich Asians’ Courtesy of Warner Bros. What was your first impression of Jon when you met him back in film school? Alice Brooks: Jon was a production designer that I did at school. I wanted Jon to turn this apartment into this disastrous New York slum. So he took the newspaper and put it on the wall with glue. It looked beautiful and then he didn’t ever clean it up. He just left. Jon M. Chn: I had a partner who said they were going to do it. That’s my explanation. I remember Alice because she was a superstar, so I knew her before that. She wrote something that got chosen, and she was the DP on it. I remember watching that story and being shocked because it was shot in a subway, and when it went dark, it was all black light. It was shocking to me. So I always wanted to work with Alice. Myron, how did you get involved with Jon on “Crazy Rich Asians”? Kerstein: I heard that I was on the list of potential editors that Warner Bros. was considering to present to Jon for this film called “Crazy Rich Asians,” and I quickly became intrigued because I was a fan of Jon’s films already. I ended up using every resource I could to get in the room. That room happened to be Skype, and Jon was in Malaysia. I just had to go guns blazing and say, “I’ll put 300% into this thing. I know you don’t know who I am, but I love this script already.” And he hired me. Chu: He moved to Malaysia, and we were there eating chicken and rice and had a great time. We found that movie together, like, we really did. I’m changing diapers for the first time while we’re editing in the room next door, and I’m bringing the baby in with headphones so she can’t hear anything while we’re blasting Coldplay. It was a really beautiful experience. And then I was like, “I’m never, never letting you go. You made my life so much better, and you’re making our movies better.” Moving all these years forward, you’re collaborating on “Wicked” and “Wicked: For Good.” How would you describe this friendship and your shorthand? Brooks: We’ve been on this for four and a half years. Jon called first called while Myron was cutting “In the Heights,” and I don’t think a day has gone by that not one of us has at least spoken to each other. I talk to Myron all the time. I just spent all week with Jon. When I’m not talking with them, they’re talking with one another. It’s a bittersweet ending to the movie because it’s been all three of us walking down the yellow brick road together for the last four and a half years. Kerstein: To be each other’s cheerleader, but also to express your worries without having to worry about hurting somebody’s feelings. It’s just an amazing journey. I’ve been able to grow more since I’ve met Jon and Alice than I had in the 15 or so years before. That trust and love is so unique in this industry. Chu: I think trust and love is right. I think trust is No. 1. We all came at a time in our lives where we had something to prove. We have all been underestimated in our work. I love working with people who love their work more than anything and who have pride in the work. That’s not always the case, especially if people have been around for a while. I think we fight for what we believe in, and we are looking for something bigger in our storytelling. We came in [as] underdogs, especially in “Wicked” where everyone around us — the studio and everyone was like, “Can these people do it?” And we’re like, we already know we can. We’ve done it on different scales. So I think that camaraderie is really beautiful. So we’re protecting each other in every moment. But I think now we’ve done it enough times that we trust our creative process that we can riff and find, and that’s where the magic is for us. What can we expect this time around with “Wicked: For Good?” Brooks: This movie is so much bigger and expansive than the first movie. It is just this epic conclusion to our story. It’s beautiful, wonderful and a huge, emotional journey. The first movie is effervescent and about choices, and the second movie is about consequences, and you can feel that weight and density throughout the movie. Half of the first movie takes place during the day, and the second movie takes place during the night, and there’s there. So both movies together feel cohesive. Myron, you’ve mentioned cutting the first film, you cried during the Ozdust ballroom sequence, is there a scene that made you cry this time around? Kerstein: It’s probably not a big spoiler to say that “For Good” is a major emotional moment in this movie, and I’m excited for the audience to experience Jon, Cynthia and Ari’s interpretation of it. I’ll just say that I’ve watched that particular number probably over 100 times. Even yesterday, when we’re finishing the mix, it didn’t fail to make me cry. Chu: There are so many moments. What I love about movie two is that we have lived with this whole story for four and a half. We have lived with this arc, and the world only knows the first half. The magic trick was to make the first half feel like a complete story, but we left a lot dangling. But the fact that people have accepted that and love it, wait until you see what the girls do in “For Good.” If you thought they were great actors, then this is where the meat is. This is the reason for “Wicked” to even exist. You see Cynthia do “No Good Deed.” I have never watched it with just two people who haven’t applauded at the end of that number, it thrusts it out of you. I’m not sure there’s a bigger number ever of a singular person singing a singular song that is more epic. It is a classic waiting to happen, and so I can’t wait for people to feel that. People don’t even know what’s about to happen there. Ari singing “Couldn’t Be Happier.” Oh, my God, that’s one of the hardest ones to crack. And when you have Jonathan Bailey and Cynthia singing. These kids who watch the first film, they’re going to grow up in movie two. It’s real emotions. This is where we can really expand in the cinematic scope and not just look visual, but I’m talking emotional ways, so I love what Myron said, we get to just advance the movie, making part of it as well, because the girls have advanced in it. By the way, we’re shooting this one day after the other so it’s not like they had to jump constantly. It’s all crafts people really making sure it works. Well, we can’t wait to see “Wicked: For Good.” Chu: To connect it all that for a movie that’s all about friendship, the hardships of friendship and the beauty of friendships, it’s hard to say goodbye, but at the same time, it’s just as beautiful to have that be made by friends who have gone through the ups and downs, who fight regularly, but love each other in the end.",https://variety.com/2025/artisans/festivals/wicked-for-good-story-of-friendship-with-jon-m-chu-1236547131,Entertainment,variety.com,Jazz Tangcay,https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Wicked_-For-Good.jpg?w=1000&h=563&crop=1,2025-10-16T16:10:04+00:00,8fadd9f8a49b139e68024dc9237b976c4c292c5c

The partnership also includes a cross-sampling component, letting standalone Apple TV and Peacock subs watch a selection of the other service’s shows for no extra cost. The new Apple TV-Peacock bundles will be available beginning Oct. 20 to new customers in the U.S. The package will bring together Apple originals including “Ted Lasso,” “Severance” and “The Morning Show” with Peacock’s “The Paper,” “The Office,” “The Traitors,” “Love Island USA” and more — including the NBA (which launches Oct. 21 on Peacock with pro basketball returning to NBCU after more than two decades ). Customers in the U.S. can save 37% by subscribing to the Apple TV and Peacock Premium (with ads) bundle for $14.99 per month, or 33% with the Apple TV-Peacock Premium Plus (limited ads) bundle for $19.99 per month. The deals are available through both services’ apps and websites. On a standalone basis, Apple TV — which the tech giant is rebranding to scrub the plus sign from “Apple TV+” — now costs $12.99 per month in the U.S. after a price hike this summer . After their own recent price increases , Peacock Premium (which includes ads) is $10.99/month and Premium Plus (which has limited ads in live programming) is $16.99 per month. In addition, Apple One subscribers on the Family and Premier plans can subscribe to Peacock Premium Plus and receive a 35% discount. That’s the first benefit of its kind for Apple’s all-in-one subscription bundle, according to the companies. As part of the partnership, Apple TV app users and Peacock subscribers will be able to sample a selection of the partner service’s shows in each respective app. At launch, Peacock subscribers will have access to up to three episodes of “Stick,” “Slow Horses,” “Silo,” “The Buccaneers,” “Foundation,” “Palm Royale” and “Prehistoric Planet” from Apple TV for no additional cost. Conversely, Apple TV app users will be able to watch up to three episodes of “Law & Order,” “Bel-Air,” “Twisted Metal,” “Love Island Games,” “Happy’s Place,” “The Hunting Party” and “Real Housewives of Miami” from Peacock. Separately, Comcast — NBCU’s parent company — offers the StreamSaver bundle, priced at $15 per month for Xfinity customers, which provides Peacock, Apple TV and Netflix . The Apple TV-Peacock bundle is different: It’s available nationwide, and Apple also will be partnering with Peacock to market it. For NBCU, the deal to bundle Apple TV with Peacock is part of a broader strategy to pursue more bundling and channels deals, aimed at driving growth for Peacock and exposure to even more audiences. For example, in August, NBCU announced a pact with Amazon to let Prime Video customers subscribe to Peacock . This month, NBCU secured a long-term distribution agreement with Google for carriage of its channels on YouTube TV , including the upcoming launch of Peacock as a subscription through YouTube Primetime Channels. Until recently, NBCU had not looked to forge many channel and bundle deals as it focused on growing the Peacock subscriber base directly. Now, company execs believe Peacock has reached critical mass in terms of its portfolio of sports rights, originals, next-day NBC and Bravo content, and movies including titles from Universal. “There is no more perfect combination of entertainment than the Apple TV and Peacock Bundle, with our complementary content portfolios featuring the best shows, movies, sports and live events,” said Matt Strauss, chairman of NBCUniversal Media Group. “With this first-of-its-kind initiative with Apple, we’re redefining what the customer journey should be for a streaming bundle with rich sampling and a smooth sign-up process, and we’re broadening the reach of Peacock to even more audiences.” Oliver Schusser, Apple’s VP of Apple TV, Apple Music, Sports and Beats, said in a statement: “We’re thrilled to introduce this all-inclusive bundle of incredible programming and to bring Apple TV’s beloved shows and movies to more viewers in more places. From acclaimed originals to can’t-miss live sports, the Apple TV and Peacock Bundle unites the best of entertainment in a simple and seamless experience.” Here’s a promo video for the Apple TV-Peacock bundle: VIDEO Pictured top: Reese Witherspoon and Jennifer Aniston in Apple TV’s “The Morning Show,” Steve Carrell in “The Office”",https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/apple-tv-peacock-bundle-pricing-discounts-1236554494,Entertainment,variety.com,Todd Spangler,https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Apple-TV-Peacock-Bundle.jpg?w=1000&h=563&crop=1,2025-10-16T16:00:00+00:00,a2423064f1ec03a3897e3eddf7c667745f4bbf94
74c211c587f5,When Co-Stars Become Competitors: Inside Oscar’s Toughest Supporting Actress Race Ever,,"Let me tell you a story. It’s not about kings or dragons or battles in a galaxy far, far away — it’s about Oscar contenders, given a golden pathway, only to find too many people crowding the road, making it nearly impossible to reach the end of the yellow brick trail. There’s a particular kind of Oscar-season tragedy that has nothing to do with surprise snubs. It unfolds quietly, almost mathematically — like a game of musical chairs where the music never stops, but the seats still somehow vanish. In this season’s best supporting actress race , we’re watching that story unfold in real time. This awards season has brought a glut of riches. Several presumed best picture contenders arrive not with one, but multiple standout supporting performances. It’s a filmmaker’s dream — and an actor’s dilemma. When too many brilliant performances share the same ballot line, excellence becomes its own worst enemy. That’s particularly true this year with top-tier contenders such as “ One Battle After Another ,” “Sentimental Value” and “ Marty Supreme ,” with others hovering just behind them. Paul Thomas Anderson’s “One Battle After Another” has turned both Regina Hall and Teyana Taylor into critical sensations — Hall with her seasoned restraint and sublimated grief, and Taylor with raw, electric volatility. Either could mount a serious Oscar campaign. Neither may survive having to split the vote. Joachim Trier’s “Sentimental Value” faces the same predicament. Elle Fanning, long overdue for Academy recognition, delivers what many consider her finest work yet — measured, devastating, revelatory. But Norwegian actress Inga Ibsdotter Lilleaas, in a quieter register, commands equal attention from international critics. Trier has coaxed career-defining performances from both his stars. Ironically, that achievement may be his undoing. Josh Safdie’s “Marty Supreme” pits Odessa A’zion’s breakout ferocity against Gwyneth Paltrow’s scene-stealing “comeback turn” — exactly the kind of narrative Oscar voters have historically devoured. But which one gets enough momentum to carry through? Here’s the truth. We’ve seen this before. Elijah Wood, left, Andy Serkis and Sean Astin in “The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King” ©New Line Cinema/Courtesy Everett Collection In the 2003 Oscar season, before the eventual best picture nominees were locked in, a deep bench of standout supporting performances emerged — and most were left out. In the eventual best picture winner “The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King,” Sean Astin was the mainstream favorite, riding a wave of emotion and goodwill for his portrayal of Samwise Gamgee. But speculation also swirled around Ian McKellen, previously nominated for “The Fellowship of the Ring,” and Viggo Mortensen, whose portrayal of Aragorn had become one of the trilogy’s most beloved elements. (Let’s not forget those banging the drum for Andy Serkis’ motion-capture brilliance as Gollum.) In the end, none of them were nominated — despite the film sweeping 11 Oscars . A similar story unfolded with Clint Eastwood’s “Mystic River,” widely believed to be the runner-up in best picture. Tim Robbins won best supporting actor, but many assumed co-star Kevin Bacon would finally land his first nomination. Only one made it onto the ballot. “Seabiscuit,” meanwhile, entered the race with a sprawling, critically respected ensemble. William H. Macy scored a Golden Globe nomination, Chris Cooper was recognized by SAG, and Jeff Bridges was seen as a potential spoiler on nomination morning. None were named on the day. The pattern is clear — when multiple contenders come from the same film, votes split. A little support for everyone often results in not enough support for anyone. Consider the 1994 film year, when both supporting acting categories flirted with the possibility of double-dipping. “Forrest Gump” co-stars Sally Field and Robin Wright were thought to be locks for supporting actress recognition, especially with the film dominating the box office and major precursor awards. Neither made the cut. Instead, Jennifer Tilly earned a surprise nod for “Bullets Over Broadway,” joining eventual winner Dianne Wiest — from a film that didn’t even receive a best picture nomination. The supporting actor race that same year was similarly chaotic. Pundits predicted double nominees from “Pulp Fiction” — Samuel L. Jackson and possibly Indie Spirit nominee Eric Stoltz — or from “Quiz Show,” with John Turturro (a Golden Globe and SAG nominee) and Paul Scofield. Jackson landed his deserved nomination; Turturro was famously left out in favor of Scofield in what became an infamous “cast member switcharoo.” More recently, many believed that both “The Banshees of Inisherin” and “The Fabelmans” would dominate the 2023 supporting actor race. Brendan Gleeson and Barry Keoghan ultimately made it in for “Banshees.” Paul Dano and Judd Hirsch, despite significant recognition, couldn’t both find room. Only one film went two for two — and it wasn’t “The Fabelmans.” It’s a quirk of the Academy’s voting system. In supporting categories, passion matters more than consensus. A No. 1 vote on a nominator’s ballot carries significantly more weight than being everyone’s second or third choice. When votes split between co-stars — especially in a deep field like this year’s — it opens the door for a single breakout performer from another film to sweep in and claim a nomination (or even the win). So where does that leave us today? And how do the campaigns keep their supporting ladies afloat? There’s no surefire blueprint, and it’s not always tied to what wins best picture. Celeste Holm, left, Loretta Young and Elsa Lanchester in “Come to the Stable” ©20thCentFox/Courtesy Everett Collection There has been only one instance in Oscar history when two films each claimed two nominations in the same acting category: 1949’s “Come to the Stable” (Celeste Holm and Elsa Lanchester) and “Pinky” (Ethel Barrymore and Ethel Waters). All four lost to Mercedes McCambridge from best picture winner “All the King’s Men.” Fun fact: Holm holds the record for being nominated alongside a co-star in three separate films — “Gentleman’s Agreement,” “Come to the Stable” and “All About Eve.” She’s followed by Anne Revere (“The Song of Bernadette,” “Gentleman’s Agreement”), Amy Adams (“Doubt,” “The Fighter”) and Teresa Wright (“The Little Foxes,” “Mrs. Miniver”) with two co-nominations apiece. According to Variety’s most recent predictions , “One Battle After Another” could attempt something audacious: placing two actors in two supporting categories. Benicio Del Toro and Sean Penn in supporting actor; Regina Hall and Teyana Taylor in supporting actress. If that happens, it’ll join extremely rare company. Only four films in history have double-dipped in two acting categories: “All About Eve” (1950): Anne Baxter and Bette Davis in best actress; Celeste Holm and Thelma Ritter in supporting actress. “Peyton Place” (1957): Arthur Kennedy and Russ Tamblyn in supporting actor; Hope Lange and Diane Varsi in supporting actress. “The Last Picture Show” (1971): Jeff Bridges and winner Ben Johnson in supporting actor; Ellen Burstyn and winner Cloris Leachman in supporting actress. “Terms of Endearment” (1983): Winner Shirley MacLaine and Debra Winger in actress; John Lithgow and winner Jack Nicholson in supporting actor. With “Sentimental Value,” you have two actors from a non-English language film — Fanning and Lilleaas (though Fanning primarily speaks English in the role). Representing Norway in the international feature race, the film could make history. No international feature film has ever landed two supporting actress nominations in the same year. Also notable: Only one supporting actor or actress from an international feature has ever won — Zoë Saldaña, just last year, in “Emilia Pérez.” Then there’s the buzzy late-season player, “Marty Supreme.” Oscar winner Paltrow seeks her second career nomination, 27 years after “Shakespeare in Love” (1998), and newcomer A’zion has emerged as one of the film’s most vibrant and memorable highlights. While no major precedent is at stake, it will be fascinating to see how this high-octane sports dramedy fares — especially with Timothée Chalamet now a frontrunner in best actor after the surprise NYFF screening and acclaim out of L.A.. We should mention the handful of dark horses with some semblance of multiple buzzy supporting actress turns in the mix such as “Sinners” (Hailee Steinfeld and Wunmi Mosaku), “Wake Up Dead Man” (Glenn Close and Kerry Washington), “Wicked: For Good” (Ariana Grande and Michelle Yeoh) and “Train Dreams” (Kerry Condon and Felicity Jones). One last thing I noticed in this latest round of prediction updates: only nine films are currently represented across the four acting categories — which would be the lowest tally since 1968. The lowest of all time is eight films in 1981. The record for the most movies ever represented was in 2007 with a staggering 18 films (“Michael Clayton” was the only movie that scored more than one acting nom). So, either some of our current predictions are way off (which is surely the case when assessing the race in October) — with under-the-radar contenders still waiting to emerge — or we’re headed for an unexpectedly “small” year, with some of the fewest individual films represented across the acting categories (and perhaps the artisans as well). That would track with current projections, which have four movies expected to crack double digits in total nominations on Oscar morning.

He posted on X to clarify that Musk had nothing to do with the group's ""OpenAI Files,"" which comprehensively document areas of concern with any plan to shift away from nonprofit governance. His post came after OpenAI's chief strategy officer, Jason Kwon, wrote that ""several organizations, some of them suddenly newly formed like the Midas Project, joined in and ran campaigns"" backing Musk's ""opposition to OpenAI's restructure."" ""What are you talking about?"" Johnston wrote. ""We were formed 19 months ago.

He accused OpenAI of not just trying to silence critics but possibly shut them down. ""If you wanted to constrain an org’s speech, intimidation would be one strategy, but making them uninsurable is another, and maybe that’s what’s happened to us with this subpoena,"" Johnston suggested. Other nonprofits, like the San Francisco Foundation (SFF) and Encode, accused OpenAI of using subpoenas to potentially block or slow down legal interventions. Judith Bell, SFF's chief impact officer, told NBC News that her nonprofit's subpoena came after spearheading a petition to California’s attorney general to block OpenAI's restructuring.

Published On 16 Oct 2025 16 Oct 2025 Click here to share on social media share2 Share Organisers of the 2026 FIFA World Cup have dismissed concerns that United States President Donald Trump could move matches from cities he does not deem “safe”. Republican President Trump said last month that he would consider moving games from Democrat-led San Francisco and Seattle if they did not cooperate with his immigration and crime initiatives. Recommended Stories list of 4 items end of list He raised the issue again this week, this time targeting Boston and its Democratic Mayor Michelle Wu, suggesting he could appeal directly to FIFA boss Gianni Infantino. John Kristick, who led Canada, Mexico and the United States’s successful bid to jointly host the 2026 finals, emphasised that planning has been under way for nearly a decade and remains unaffected by political rhetoric. “From what I’m seeing, there’s been zero distraction in terms of the preparedness,” Kristick, co-head of global events at Playfly Sports Consulting, said. “Tickets are already being sold. Hospitality packages have been sold for almost a year now.” More than one million World Cup tickets have been bought so far, FIFA said on Thursday, with fans from 212 countries and territories snapping up seats. FIFA previously said that the global governing body for football has the final say on whether to move the 2026 World Cup, but this week noted, “Safety and security are obviously the governments’ responsibility. “They decide what is in the best interest for public safety,” FIFA added. “We hope every one of our 16 host cities will be ready to successfully host and fulfil all necessary requirements.” Ricardo Trade, CEO of the 2014 FIFA World Cup Brazil Local Organising Committee, said the abundance of good stadiums in the United States would make the possibility of relocating games “feasible”, so long as it does not happen after the December 5 draw. “In a country like the United States, where every state has large, ready-to-use stadiums, I don’t see why it wouldn’t be possible,” said Trade, who also served as CEO of the CONMEBOL Copa America 2024 in the US. New York and New Jersey, responsible for eight games, including the final, have maintained their focus, said NYNJ Host Committee CEO Alex Lasry, with daily fan festivals planned across the country’s biggest metropolitan region. “We’ve spoken to FIFA, we’re working with the White House Task Force, I don’t think there’s any worry about the games being moved,” said Lasry. “I have no concern, but if you know, anyone wants to move games, from Chicago to here or from anywhere to here, we’re more than excited to have more games.”",https://www.aljazeera.com/sports/2025/10/16/fifa-world-cup-2026-organisers-dismiss-trump-venue-move-threat,World,aljazeera.com,,https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2025-09-28T044944Z_31691280_RC2O0HALUVIJ_RTRMADP_3_FESTIVAL-GLOBAL-CITIZENS-NEW-YORK-1760632639.jpg?resize=1920%2C1440,,e1e49384ac09a635d956c34bec735ca963f5e1e6

Published On 16 Oct 2025 16 Oct 2025 | Updated: 6 minutes ago Updated: 6 minutes ago Click here to share on social media share2 Share At least two people have been killed after police in Kenya fired shots to disperse crowds of mourners gathered to view the body of opposition leader Raila Odinga, who died earlier this week in India. The country’s head of police operations, Adamson Bungei, confirmed the shooting at the 60,000-capacity football stadium in the capital, Nairobi, where the viewing was to take place on Thursday ahead of the funeral over the weekend. Recommended Stories list of 3 items end of list “We have at least two deaths,” Bungei told The Associated Press news agency, describing the incident as a “confrontation.” Local media outlets KTN News and Citizen TV later said the death toll had increased to four, with dozens of people injured. After security forces fired shots, police lobbed tear gas to disperse thousands of mourners, the two broadcasters showed, leaving the stadium deserted. Thousands of Odinga’s supporters began gathering on Nairobi’s streets from early morning on Thursday, with crowds congregating at Nairobi’s Moi International Sports Centre for the viewing. Tensions increased when some people breached a gate in the arena, with security forces firing shots and tear gas in response. As mourners fled, a stampede erupted near the stadium gates. After the incident, President William Ruto arrived at the stadium with members of Odinga’s family to view the coffin. Ruto and Odinga’s family paid their respects in a side room of the stadium. The public viewing took place hours later outside the stadium gates. Tensions had began earlier in the day when thousands of mourners briefly stormed Nairobi’s international airport, interrupting a ceremony for Ruto and other officials to receive Odinga’s body with military honours. The incident prompted a two-hour suspension of airport operations. Crowds also gathered in Bondo, the family’s ancestral seat in western Kenya, where Odinga is due to be buried on Sunday. Odinga, ​​a key figure in African politics, died at the age of 80 on Wednesday during a trip to India for medical treatment, according to local police and hospital officials. The former prime minister, who was affectionately known as “Baba” (father), ran five unsuccessful presidential campaigns between 1997 and 2022, but was seen as a major force for democratic reform. “He fought tirelessly for multi-party democracy, and we are enjoying those freedoms today because of his struggle,” university student Felix Ambani Uneck told Reuters at the stadium. Friday has been declared a public holiday and Kenyans are expected to gather at a different football stadium in Nairobi for a state funeral service. Another public viewing will be held on Saturday in the western county of Kisumu, close to Odinga’s rural home.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/16/police-in-kenya-fire-tear-gas-to-disperse-mourners-at-raila-odinga-viewing,World,aljazeera.com,,https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/AFP__20251016__78ZL9GA__v3__HighRes__TopshotKenyaPoliticsOdinga-1760627309.jpg?resize=1920%2C1440,,122d3abf5c21d54c5c91ec8de9b54790b44b3bf5

It interacts with the world around you—sniffing some things, relieving itself on others. You walk down the Embarcadero in San Francisco on a bright sunny day, and you see the Ferry Building in the distance as you look out into the bay. Your dog turns to you, looks you in the eye, and says, “Did you know this waterfront was blocked by piers and a freeway for 100 years?” OK now imagine your dog looks like an alien and only you can see it. That’s the vision for a new capability created for the Niantic Labs AR experience Peridot . Niantic, also the developer of the worldwide AR behemoth Pokémon Go , hopes to build out its vision of extending the metaverse into the real world by giving people the means to augment the space around them with digital artifacts. Peridot is a mobile game that lets users customize and interact with their own little Dots—dog-sized digital companions that appear on your phone’s screen and can look like they’re interacting with the world objects in the view of your camera lens. They’re very cute, and yes, they look a lot like Pokémon. Now, they can talk. Peridot started as a mobile game in 2022, then got infused with generative AI features . The game has since moved into the hands of Niantic Spatial , a startup created in April that aims to turn geospatial data into an accessible playground for its AR ambitions. Now called Peridot Beyond , it has been enabled in Snap’s Spectacles . Hume AI, a startup running a large language model that aims to make chatbots seem more empathetic , is now partnering with Niantic Spatial to bring a voice to the Dots on Snap’s Spectacles.

f64227e8cb97,Astronomers close in on ancient signal from 'one of the most unexplored periods in our universe',,"Long before starlight filled the cosmos for the first time, the young universe may have been simmering, according to a new study. The findings suggest that about 800 million years after the Big Bang, energy from newborn black holes and the fading embers of the first stars was already warming vast clouds of intergalactic hydrogen gas, offering a rare glimpse into a largely uncharted chapter of the universe's youth. The results also bring astronomers a step closer to detecting a faint radio signal known as the 21-centimeter hydrogen line, an elusive imprint that could reveal the properties of those primordial stars and black holes that reionized the cosmos. ""It's one of the most unexplored periods in our universe,"" study co-author Ridhima Nunhokee , a research scientist at the International Centre for Radio Astronomy Research in Perth, Australia, told Live Science. ""There's just so much to learn."" Astronomers know that the universe began in an extremely hot, dense state, the Big Bang , about 13.8 billion years ago, and then cooled rapidly as it expanded. Roughly 400,000 years later, temperatures dropped enough for protons and electrons to merge into neutral hydrogen atoms, and the cosmos slipped into the ""cosmic dark ages "" — a long, lightless stretch when space was veiled by a dense fog of hydrogen gas. Hundreds of millions of years later, the first generations of massive stars and faint young galaxies ignited, emitting intense ultraviolet light that slowly burned away this fog in a transformative period known as the Epoch of Reionization. That process, which ended about 1 billion years after the Big Bang, made the universe transparent and allowed starlight to travel freely through space for the first time, marking the dawn of the cosmos as we know it. What the universe was like as it began to emerge from those dark ages remains one of astronomy's biggest open questions. Get the world’s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox. The new findings, detailed in a paper published Sept. 30 in The Astrophysical Journal , suggest that before the universe ""lit up,"" it may not have been as frigid as many models predict. By narrowing the possibilities for what the early cosmos was like, the results offer an important new clue to understanding how the first stars and galaxies began to reshape their environment, researchers say. The radio sky image (background) represents the cleanest signal ever produced from data collected by the Murchison Widefield Array (foreground) in Western Australia. (Image credit: Nunhokee et al/ICRAR/Curtin University) The universe's echoes Because direct observation of the universe's first stars isn't possible — they were too faint, too short-lived, and far too distant for even the most powerful telescopes to detect — astronomers instead look for the subtle fingerprints those stars left in the hydrogen gas that surrounded them. In the new study, Nunhokee and her team analyzed nearly a decade's worth of data from the Murchison Widefield Array, a powerful radio telescope located in the remote Western Australian desert, to search for a faint radio ""whisper"" from that ancient hydrogen. The signal arises when a hydrogen atom's sole proton and electron flip their spins relative to each other — a minute change that alters the atom's energy and causes it to emit or absorb a photon at a specific wavelength. Astronomers hunt for the faint radio echo of this transition, which appears at a wavelength of 21 centimeters — or, to our instruments, a frequency of about 1.42 gigahertz. Because the signal's strength is affected by the temperature and environment of the surrounding hydrogen gas, it acts like a cosmic thermometer, revealing how the first stars and black holes began to influence the early universe. Detecting this ancient signal, however, is extraordinarily difficult. It is buried beneath layers of much stronger radio noise from the Milky Way , other nearby galaxies, Earth's atmosphere and even the telescope itself. To uncover it, the team developed a new statistical filtering technique to strip away these foreground signals and isolate the most probable emission from hydrogen gas dating to roughly 800 million years after the Big Bang. This new approach produced the cleanest radio map yet of the early universe and set the most stringent limits so far on the strength of the 21-centimeter signal, the team noted in the study. Despite focusing on what Nunhokee described as ""kind of a cold patch where we have just a few sources,"" and using ""the best data that we have,"" the team found no evidence for the telltale signal. ""Because it's very faint, it's very hard,"" she said. After cleaning the data, the researchers didn't see the distinctive signature that would indicate a ""cold start"" to reionization. This feature would have been visible in their data if the universe, about 800 million years after the Big Bang, had remained frigid until the first stars ignited, so the result suggested the universe was warmer than expected, according to the study. ""As the universe evolved, the gas between galaxies expands and cools, so we would expect it to be very, very cold,"" study lead author Cathryn Trott , a professor at the Curtin Institute of Radio Astronomy, said in a statement . ""Our measurements show that it is at least heated by a certain amount. Not by a lot, but it tells us that very cold reionisation is ruled out — that's really interesting."" Cosmological models point to X-rays from early black holes and the remnants of massive stars as the likely culprits heating the intergalactic gas long before visible starlight filled the cosmos, Nunhokee said. The team's new data-cleaning technique also lays crucial groundwork for the upcoming Square Kilometre Array (SKA). Scientists say this next-generation radio telescope, which is now under construction in Australia and South Africa, will have the sensitivity to detect the elusive 21-centimeter signal directly. ""We know what we are looking for,"" Nunhokee said. ""We just need a few hours of [SKA's] data that will allow us to go to the levels that we want to.""",https://www.livescience.com/space/astronomy/astronomers-close-in-on-ancient-signal-from-one-of-the-most-unexplored-periods-in-our-universe,Science,livescience.com,,https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/SuLZEX3LBgUsr7qeZr5gCN-1676-80.jpg,2025-10-16T17:23:30+00:00,c64cf946fc40dacfae237f704a1075a973c054c9
e728821d2687,"An Iranian volcano appears to have woken up — 700,000 years after its last eruption",,"A volcano in southern Iran thought to have been extinct for some 710,000 years has stirred. New research published Oct. 7 in the journal Geophysical Research Letters finds that an area of ground near the Taftan volcano's summit rose 3.5 inches (9 centimeters) over 10 months between July 2023 and May 2024. The uplift has not yet receded, suggesting a buildup of gas pressure below the volcano's surface. The findings reveal the need for closer monitoring of the volcano, which hasn't been considered a risk to people before, said study senior author Pablo González , a volcanologist at the Institute of Natural Products and Agrobiology, a research center of the Spanish National Research Council (IPNA-CSIC). Volcanoes are considered extinct if they haven't erupted in the Holocone era, which started 11,700 years ago. Given its recent activity, González said, Taftan might be more accurately described as dormant. ""It has to release somehow in the future, either violently or more quietly,"" González told Live Science. There is no reason to fear an imminent eruption, he said, but the volcano should be more closely monitored. Taftan volcano is a 12,927-foot (3,940 meters) stratovolcano in southeastern Iran, situated among a rumple of mountains and volcanoes that was formed by the subduction of the Arabian ocean crust under the Eurasian continent. Today, the volcano hosts an active hydrothermal system and smelly, sulfur-emitting vents called fumaroles, but it isn't known to have erupted in human history. When Mohammadhossein Mohammadnia , a doctoral student working under González at IPNA-CSIC, first examined satellite imagery of the volcano in 2020, he saw no evidence that it was doing much of anything. But then, in 2023, people started reporting gaseous emissions from the volcano on social media. The emissions could be smelled from the city of Khash about 31 miles (50 kilometers) away. Mohammadnia took another look at the satellite imagery from the European Space Agency 's Sentinel-1 mission, which provides round-the-clock imagery of Earth's surface. Taftan is remote and does not have a GPS monitoring system such as those found on volcanoes like Mount St. Helen's; the area is also dangerous due to the activity of insurgent groups and border conflicts between Iran and Pakistan. The satellite imagery revealed a slight rise of the ground near the summit, indicating increased pressure below. Get the world’s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox. Mohammadnia calculated that the driver of this uplift sits 1,608 to 2,067 feet (490 to 630 m) below the surface. It's impossible to know exactly what is going on, but the researchers ruled out external factors like nearby earthquakes or rainfall, Mohammadnia told Live Science. The volcano's magma reservoir sits more than 2 miles (3.5 km) down — far deeper than whatever is driving the uplift. Instead, either the uplift is caused by a change in the hydrothermal plumbing below the volcano that is leading to the buildup of gas, or a small amount of magma may have shifted beneath the volcano, allowing gases to bubble up into the rocks above, raising the pressure in rock pores and fractures, and causing the ground to heave up slightly. The next stage in the research, according to González, will be to collaborate with scientists who do gas monitoring at volcanoes. ""This study doesn't aim to produce panic in the people,"" he said. ""It's a wake-up call to the authorities in the region in Iran to designate some resources to look at this.""",https://www.livescience.com/planet-earth/volcanos/an-iranian-volcano-appears-to-have-woken-up-700-000-years-after-its-last-eruption,Science,livescience.com,,https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/SbhNoqVKPpbVymi2h5ZLe3-1600-80.jpg,2025-10-16T16:50:13+00:00,47b7904982218749b73c9d270ab0f0e81843bf03
55a401e9719d,"NBA Franchise Player rankings: Each team's top player in 10 tiers, from superstars to still searching",,"Being a franchise player can be tricky business -- for the player and the NBA franchise. Finding the proper match where the union is solid and neither side has a wandering eye can be complicated. Ahead of his 11th season, Nikola Jokić recently said ""my plan is to be a Nugget forever."" That represents the best-case scenario in a fickle business -- two sides that can't imagine being without each other. Somewhat less ideal is what unfolded during Bucks media day, when managing governor Wes Edens said he had a conversation with Giannis Antetokounmpo this offseason in which his franchise player expressed his commitment to Milwaukee. When asked about it shortly thereafter Giannis replied ""I cannot recall that meeting."" Ouch. When it comes to franchise players, it's not just about the player's talent but also the fit with his team. Less than a year ago everyone figured Luka Dončić would be a Forever Maverick and one day get a statue outside American Airlines Center in Dallas just like Dirk Nowitzki before him. Now Luka plays for the Lakers . The Franchise Player Tiers that follow try to keep all that in mind: How good is the player and what kind of situation is he in for the short and long-term? And in some cases, as we go lower down the list, are the players in question actually franchise-level talents or do their teams just want to squint at them hard enough to convince themselves? Tier 1: Envy of the League Nikola Jokic (Denver Nuggets) Shai Gilgeous-Alexander (Oklahoma City Thunder) Luka Doncic (Los Angeles Lakers) Victor Wembanyama (San Antonio Spurs) No surprises here. Each of these guys finished in the top five of our Top 100 list heading into this season. Jokic has won three of the last five MVPs -- and likely could have had more if not for voter fatigue -- and remains one of the betting favorites along with SGA to reclaim that particular piece of hardware. He bootstrapped a not-nearly-as-deep Nuggets team into forcing Game 7 in the second round of the playoffs against the eventual champion Thunder. And in the annual general manager survey conducted by NBA.com , Joker -- who is listed by the league at 6-foot-11, 284 pounds -- was also the overwhelming choice as the NBA 's best passer and highest basketball IQ. Because he does stuff like this: SGA is coming off a banner season where he delivered Oklahoma City's first championship parade. In the process he became just the fourth player in NBA history to lead the league in scoring while winning MVP and Finals MVP, joining Kareem Abdul-Jabar, Michael Jordan and Shaquille O'Neal. Then he signed a monster four-year, $285 million extension in July. Who's doing it better than that guy? (Rhetorical.) Luka made five straight first-team All-NBA selections before that run was temporarily halted last season due to nagging injuries that kept him below the 65-game threshold required to qualify. He was also the center of the most shocking trade in recent memory (or ever) when he was shipped to the Lakers in a deal that will haunt Mavs fans -- and by extension Dallas GM Nico Harrison -- forever. Dončić is still only 26, and now we'll see what kind of havoc he unleashes on the league with his new slimmed-down revenge body . Wembanyama was already tall, but apparently he grew again? The Spurs are now listing him at 7-foot-5. Feels like that shouldn't be allowed, especially given his already outsized skillset. Last season, he became just the second player in NBA history to record a line of 25+ points, 5+ rebounds, 5+ assists, 5+ steals and 5+ blocks in multiple games. The other guy is Hakeem Olajuwon. That's good company. Unfortunately for Wembanyama, his second season was cut short when he was shut down after just 46 games due to deep vein thrombosis in his right shoulder. Despite that, he still led the league with 176 blocks -- which was 28 more than Brook Lopez , who finished second in that category and played 80 games, and 63 more than Evan Mobley , who won Defensive Player of the Year. Wembanyama is only 21. This is a superhero origin story where he's still learning what his abilities are. The rest of the league is in so much trouble when he figures out how to fully use his powers. NBA Top 100 players, ranked: How Nikola Jokić, SGA, Luka Dončić and more stack up as new season begins Sam Quinn Tier 2: How Much Longer Will it Last? Giannis Antetokounmpo (Milwaukee Bucks) Stephen Curry (Golden State Warriors) If it was only about talent, Giannis would be safely ensconced in Tier 1, and he and the Bucks would be happily married forever. Alas, there are other factors here, namely how long he will remain in Milwaukee. When determining franchise players, it helps to know which franchise he might be employed by -- not just right now but moving forward. Antetokounmpo recently said that he's ""locked into"" the Bucks for this season but reserves the right to change his mind in ""six, seven months."" That not-so-muffled scream you hear is coming from Bucks fans who will have to deal with this topic for the foreseeable future. The Bucks decided to waive-and-stretch Damian Lillard this offseason, a short-term patch that allowed them to poach Myles Turner from the Indiana Pacers in a desperate attempt to stay relevant and appease Giannis. (Elsewhere on the desperation and appeasement front: The Bucks signed two of Giannis's brothers, Thanasis and Alex. We're maybe one more probing Knicks call from distant cousins and aunties getting on Milwaukee's payroll.) Stretching Lillard will cost the Bucks $22.5 million per season over the next five years, severely hampering their team building options. Giannis has already said he wants to win another championship. He'll be 31 in December. Even in a weakened Eastern Conference, can the Bucks realistically offer him that opportunity anytime soon? Put another way, who's the third best player on that team after Giannis and Turner? Is it Bobby Portis ? Kyle Kuzma ? AJ Green ? Whatever the answer, it's not great. There's a reason why the Knicks reportedly looked into acquiring Giannis this offseason. There are 29 other teams watching this with great interest and waiting for him to ask out so they can potentially pounce. As for Steph, the greatest shooter of all time isn't going anywhere, and the Warriors have high hopes for a full season of him paired with Jimmy Butler , longtime running mate Draymond Green and new center Al Horford . Unfortunately, time comes for all of us. This will be Curry's 17th season, and he turns 38 in March. There's an argument to be made that how much time he has left should outweigh time already served, that younger players with their whole careers ahead of them (like the guys in Tier 5) should be higher than someone who has most of his in the rearview. You could certainly make that argument — but I won't. What he has behind him is a whole lot more than most players will ever muster, and that counts for quite a bit. And oh yeah, he still made second-team All-NBA last year . He's not done yet. Tier 3: Ready For Superstar Leap Anthony Edwards (Minnesota Timberwolves) Cade Cunningham (Detroit Pistons) If you want to graduate either of these guys into the elite Tier 1 right now without further delay, I won't fight you. Ant previously said he doesn't want to be the face of the league, but since he's become the face of the Wolves he's helped pick up a franchise that was down bad for a while. The man took the Wolves to back-to-back Western Conference finals, has played more than 72 games in each of his first five seasons, and is generally a delight whether he's throwing down monster dunks, leading the league in 3-pointers made as he did a year ago, or entertaining us (well maybe not Lakers fans) with a little postseason walk-and-trash talk . Cade Cunningham made his first All-NBA selection last season. In the process, he took the Pistons from the worst team in the league two seasons ago when they won just 14 games to a 44-win team that claimed the six seed in the Eastern Conference, making Detroit the first team in NBA history to triple its win total year over year. The last seven MVPs have all been foreign-born players. The last time someone from the states took home the hardware was James Harden back in 2018. If you were betting on the next American to win the award, look no further than one of these two. Tier 4: Solid Footing Jalen Brunson (New York Knicks) Donovan Mitchell (Cleveland Cavaliers) Paolo Banchero (Orlando Magic) Maybe this group doesn't have the same Q rating as the players ahead of them but their teams are in good shape with them leading the way. Jalen Brunson finished in the top five of the MVP voting two seasons ago, has made two straight All-NBA teams, and helped the Knicks reach the Eastern Conference finals for the first time in 25 years. Donovan Mitchell finished fifth in MVP voting last season, made first team All-NBA and was a key reason why the Cavaliers had their best season (non-LeBron division) in recent memory. And Paolo Banchero got a five-year $239 million max extension and has a lot of people — hi, it's me, I am ""a lot of people"" in this context — eyeing the Magic as a make-the-leap team this season. Tier 5: Injury Gap Year Jayson Tatum (Boston Celtics) Tyrese Haliburton (Indiana Pacers) Oof. Both suffered Achilles tears during the postseason, impacting not just the playoffs but the offseason approach for both organizations. The Celtics moved on from Jrue Holiday , Kristaps Porzingis , Al Horford and Luke Kornet among others in order to avoid paying around half a billion dollars (!) for a roster that likely won't have Tatum this season -- even though he recently posted a video of himself dunking mere months removed from his surgery. Haliburton had a spectacular postseason run and looked great to start Game 7 against the Thunder in the Finals before suffering the injury that everyone feared. That gave the typically financially conservative Pacers the cover they needed to let Myles Turner walk this offseason with the evident thought process being something approaching ""why pay more for a team that can't win anything significant until Haliburton is back when you can just go get Jay Huff ?"" I like Jay Huff by the way. Hi Jay if you're reading this (and even if you're not). Even so, that is a tough turn of events for Pacers fans. Tier 6: Big Bright Future Cooper Flagg (Dallas Mavericks) Amen Thompson & Alperen Sengun (Houston Rockets) The Mavericks had a 1.8% chance to land the top pick in the draft and one of the most-hyped prospects of the last two decades. Losing Luka was a blow Mavs fans might never recover from, but pulling a hyper-talented multi-positional rabbit out of the super-long-odds lottery hat is not too bad as consolation prizes go. Flagg can impact the game at both ends of the floor, and with Kyrie Irving still recovering from an ACL injury, we might get a healthy dose of Point Cooper early on this season to supplement D'Angelo Russell . The Rockets are the only team in this exercise with two players listed (other than the Heat , but that's a different situation). This is sort of a choose-your-own adventure situation where there are no wrong answers on which one could become the face of the franchise. Sengun came in six spots higher in our Top 100 and made the All-Star team last season, while Thompson was selected as the most athletic player, the most versatile defender, and the most likely to have a breakout season in the NBA.com GM survey. For my money, I'm going with Thompson. I mean, just look at this . There's a reason why everyone from LeBron James to Steve Kerr to De'Aaron Fox has openly gushed about Thompson's athleticism. Tier 7: OK…but Where Do They Actually Get You? Devin Booker (Phoenix Suns) Kawhi Leonard (Los Angeles Clippers) This is the tier where questions start popping up and you wonder if the franchise player can provide the proper answers. Booker signed a two-year $145 million extension this offseason that the Suns rushed to give him even though they could (and should) have waited. Owner Mat Ishbia has called him the franchise player, indicated multiple times he's not going anywhere, and also said that he and Booker are ""aligned"" on the Suns future. The Suns won 36 games a season ago and missed the playoffs when Kevin Durant was in uniform alongside Booker. KD now plays in Houston. Color me skeptical that it will go better for Booker and the Suns in a loaded Western Conference when he's now paired with another high-usage, high-volume (and far more inefficient) shooter in Jalen Green . Since Kawhi left Toronto for L.A., the Clippers have gotten out of the second round once and have been a first-round exit in each of the last three postseasons. Part of struggle has been his injury history, but he was healthy for last year's playoffs and the Clips still got bounced in seven games by the Nuggets. Then there's the investigation into questions about an alleged no-show endorsement deal hovering over him and the team that don't figure to go anywhere anytime soon. The Clippers are deep and talented -- but even with Kawhi, they're still the Clippers. Tier 8: [Insert Name] is Unavailable, Please Leave a Message Joel Embiid (Philadelphia 76ers) Zion Williamson (New Orleans Pelicans) Ja Morant (Memphis Grizzlies) This tier is the Island of Misfit Toys and Broken Dreams. Joel Embiid is a former MVP who has missed close to half the games in his career due to a variety of injuries and has never advanced past the second round of the playoffs. Zion Williamson has played 30 or fewer games in four of his six NBA seasons, including last year. Ja Morant has never played more than 67 games in a single season, and appeared in a total of 59 games over the last two seasons combined. And unlike Embiid and Williamson, I'm not convinced that Morant — who, it should be stipulated, is as athletic and enjoyable to watch as anyone in the NBA when healthy -- is even the best player on his own team when that team also employs two-way star Jaren Jackson Jr . Tier 9: The Leftovers Trae Young (Atlanta Hawks) Tyler Herro/Bam Adebayo (Miami Heat) Scottie Barnes (Toronto Raptors) LaMelo Ball (Charlotte Hornets) Josh Giddey (Chicago Bulls) What are we even doing here? This is the hang your head in your hands tier. Trae Young is still waiting and hoping for the Hawks to offer him the four-year $229 million extension he's eligible to sign. If you're made to wait and wonder about that kind of thing, it's generally a sign that you're not really the franchise player. (Related: put me down for Jalen Johnson actually being the best player on the Hawks.) Same goes for Josh Giddey, who had to haggle with the Bulls over his latest deal during restricted free agency before landing on an average annual value of $25 million over four years. Good work if you can get it, but not truly a franchise player. After Miami bundled Jimmy Butler off to the Bay, it felt like the leading man role was being transferred to Tyler Herro by default, but if you prefer Bam Adebayo as the star avatar here that's fine. Either way, the Heat got dusted in a four-game sweep by the Cavs last postseason. Not a great result for whoever wants to own that. Adebayo shot just 43.8% from the field in that series and was minus-73 over four games. Herro was even worse. He hit just 41.5% of his shots and was minus-87. Yikes all the way around. The Raptors would love for Scottie Barnes to make them a thing. So far, he hasn't and they're not. Even in a weak Eastern Conference, is Barnes good enough to make them anything more than a back-end playoff team? I'm skeptical. And LaMelo Ball -- the living embodiment of the classic no-no-yes chaos agent with the mayhem dials cranked up as far as they will possibly go -- came in at No. 53 in our Top 100. Do not blame me for that. I was the lowest on him of all our voters at No. 76. I still think I might have had him too high. He tossed up a YOLO catch-and-shoot fadeaway 3 the other day that made exactly no sense to anyone in the building except him; it was preseason, but the man is already in midseason form. Tier 10: Still Searching Brooklyn Nets Washington Wizards Sacramento Kings Utah Jazz Portland Trail Blazers You will notice that the Nets , Wizards , Kings , Jazz and Blazers have no one listed here. Some of them are better positioned than others going forward. The Blazers have good pieces, if not anyone who fits into a franchise or even star context. And I wouldn't bet against the Jazz figuring things out over the long haul when they have not one but two Ainges in charge. Even so, all of them should consider some sort of blood sacrifice to curry favor with the Basketball Gods, or at the very least burn some sage.",https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/nba-franchise-player-rankings-each-teams-top-player-in-10-tiers-from-superstars-to-still-searching,Sport,cbssports.com,,https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2025/10/16/4febbc16-b8c4-44da-af8d-19290bc876ae/thumbnail/1200x675/38832b4e994be8e078a948e870b4c61e/steph-getty-4.png,2025-10-16T17:18:00+00:00,2cd5fff9f1dda7ff7ea77fed2886937ff2d9eeaf
0d549130eb42,Who's using their rookies the most? Ranking NFL teams by snaps played -- and what it says about their future,"nfl, rookie, nfl rookie, snaps, rookie snaps, browns, patriots, jets, 49ers, ravens","There are various reasons why a rookie might have to play, including injuries and simply being the best option. Reflecting upon the first six weeks of the NFL season, some of the post-draft notions about classes have come to fruition. The top three teams in terms of snaps played by rookies, for instance, were all consistently lauded among post-draft grades. It is interesting, but probably not surprising, that the eight teams that have deployed rookies the most are also currently top 10 in the projected 2026 NFL Draft order. As teams start thinking about the future, they are attempting to learn which players on the current roster will remain and which positions may need to be turned over when roster construction resumes next spring. Without further ado, here are the league's teams ranked, from most to least, by rookie snaps played this season: Top five 1. Browns (19.8%) Cleveland is the only team in which rookies have played at least 15% of the total snaps on each side of the ball. A total of 13 rookies have taken snaps for the Browns this season, which represents nearly a quarter of the active roster. Defensive tackle Mason Graham , linebacker Carson Schwesinger , running back Quinshon Judkins tight end Harold Fannin Jr . and quarterback Dillon Gabriel are among the notable participants. 2. Patriots (16.9%) New England had been discussed as having arguably the best draft class. To this point, the production has met the expectations. Nine players have taken snaps for the Patriots; four of which have played at least 100 snaps. Offensive linemen Will Campbell and Jared Wilson are shouldering the load on offense, while safety Craig Woodson is the key figure on defense. 3. Jets (16.2%) The Jets were another team that was widely praised for its draft efforts and the group has delivered to this point. Seven have played for the AFC East franchise and five of those have seen extended playing time, including offensive tackle Armand Membou and tight end Mason Taylor . 4. 49ers (15.1%) Only five rookies have taken snaps for San Francisco this season, but each of them has played at least 100 snaps, including undrafted free agent safety Marques Sigle . First-round pick Mykel Williams has gone from a complementary piece opposite Nick Bosa to a focal point of the team's pass rush. 5. Ravens (15.1%) Baltimore is a unique case because it has received a measly 11 offensive snaps from wide receiver LaJohntay Wester . Injuries on defense have forced the rookie class to play significant snaps, including first-round safety Malaki Starks , edge rusher Mike Green and linebacker Teddye Buchanan . Middle class 6. Titans (14.7%) 7. Panthers (12.9%) 8. Saints (12.9%) 9. Dolphins (12.1%) 10. Bengals (12.0%) 11. Commanders (11.6%) 12. Buccaneers (11.5%) 13. Giants (10.9%) 14. Seahawks (10.4%) 15. Falcons (10.2%) 16. Texans (10.0%) 17. Chargers (9.2%) 18. Eagles (9.2%) 19. Chiefs (9.0%) 20. Raiders (8.7%) 21. Lions (8.2%) 22. Jaguars (7.7%) 23. Cowboys (7.2%) 24. Bills (6.9%) 25. Cardinals (6.6%) 26. Vikings (6.4%) 27. Colts (6.3%) Bottom five 28. Packers (5.9%) First-round wide receiver Matthew Golden is the only rookie to eclipse 100 snaps played for the Packers this season. Golden is the fourth-leading receiver on Green Bay's roster. They do have one of the most well-rounded rosters in the league, so there might not be many opportunities for young players. 29. Bears (5.8%) Eight rookies have played for Chicago this season, but none of them have emerged into the starting lineup. The Bears are a team that could play rookies more as the season progresses and they become more integrated into their system. 30. Steelers (5.2%) First-round pick Derrick Harmon missed some time early in the season, but he is the only starter from this class. In fact, Pittsburgh has gotten 27 total snaps out of its offensive rookies. 31. Chargers (4.5%) The Chargers embraced several rookies last season, so there may not have been a lot of room for newcomers. Running back Omarion Hampton is now dealing with an injury. Production heavily skews offense as defensive tackle Jamaree Caldwell is essentially the only contributor on that side of the ball. 32. Rams (3.3%) The other Los Angeles team is also at the bottom of the list. The Rams are the only team with fewer than 5% snaps played by rookies on each side of the ball. Los Angeles already has a really young roster. The Rams have made one first-round pick, edge rusher Jared Verse , since Jared Goff in 2016. They did trade out of the 2025 first round to pick up an additional first-round pick in the 2026 NFL Draft .",https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/ranking-nfl-teams-by-rookie-snaps-played-2025-browns-patriots-jets-49ers-ravens,Sport,cbssports.com,,https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2025/10/15/a24687a7-227c-4a7d-afd5-70e3f815a22b/thumbnail/1200x675/996204f3706e5fc4bd9229edc445647d/gettyimages-2239030333-1.jpg,2025-10-16T17:16:39+00:00,981370ea13f0f339428391c4b48bfdbf844f3f77
9ed7f6251d60,How star transfer MiLaysia Fulwiley is embracing the challenge of becoming LSU's point guard,,"MiLaysia Fulwiley has not played a game for LSU yet, but she is already playing an important role for the Tigers. Not only is she bringing the energy and athleticism that made her so popular at South Carolina, she has also been embracing the point guard responsibilities. ""She's been everything we wanted and then some,"" LSU associate head coach Bob Starkey told CBS Sports. ""She was a kid that we didn't know much about other than the fact that when we played South Carolina she torched us. But she's just such a special person, not just a player."" Fulwiley's decision to transfer from South Carolina to LSU was one of college basketball's biggest offseason moves. The 5-foot-10 guard averaged 11.7 points per game for the Gamecocks while mostly coming off the bench. She is known for her athletic ability and flashy style of play, which has definitely not gone away. ""She's going to do something exciting in practice every day. She is just that type of player,"" Starkey said. ""But I have really enjoyed getting to know her as a person. She's an outstanding young person. She's very humble. She's very committed to improving, she's highly coachable."" Fulwiley often watches film with Starkey, something she started after receiving encouragement from LSU veteran Flau'jae Johnson. During Wednesday's SEC media day, Johnson said she loves her new teammate's attitude and what she brings to the table. ""Just seeing her in practice, some of the stuff she does is like, how is she doing that?"" Johnson said. ""Her instincts. Talk about an instinctual player. She just makes us quicker, faster, and her mindset. I told her, whatever you need, I got you. She's eager to learn, so that's the best part about playing with her. She wants to learn. I told her get in that film room with Bob Starkey, and she's been going ever since."" South Carolina's Dawn Staley describes LSU's MiLaysia Fulwiley as 'younger, savvier' version of herself Isabel Gonzalez Head coach Kim Mulkey also highlighted the positive energy Fulwiley constantly brings to practice. ""I've never seen a kid smile so much. She's just happy,"" Mulkey said on Wednesday. As a freshman and sophomore at South Carolina, coach Dawn Staley often described Fulwiley as a ""generational talent"" and a ""walking highlight reel."" However, sometimes she needed to tone things down and focus on fundamentals. Fulwiley worked on making her game more well-rounded with the Gamecocks, but the learning hasn't stopped. ""It's been a big transition, but in my opinion, I think it's been great for me,"" she told reporters on Wednesday . ""Just growing as a person on the court and off the court. I'm learning a lot but I'm excited while learning, so it's been great."" Fulwiley will have to play smart basketball to be the LSU point guard. It will be a big responsibility, but Mulkey believes in her abilities. The coach knows a thing or two about it because as a former point guard, she helped Louisiana Tech win the AIAW title in 1981 and the inaugural NCAA title in 1982. Mulkey said she could have junior Mikaylah Williams run the point, but she thinks Fulwiley, Williams and Johnson on the floor together would be a powerful combination. ""I know how hard it is,"" Mulkey said. ""But if we can get her to a level of being comfortable there, then all the wonderful improvising that she does is going to still be there.... And if we can just get her to an even-keeled level to where she's comfortable, I think those are three pretty special players on the perimeter. She's been a joy to coach.""

Bet it at bet365 here : Steelers -5.5 vs. Bengals Pittsburgh carries a three-game winning streak into this matchup, while Cincinnati has lost four consecutive games. The Bengals can only blame some of their shortcomings on the absence of quarterback Joe Burrow (toe), as their defense has given up at least 27 points in five straight games. They have only covered the spread once during their losing skid, while Pittsburgh has covered in all three of its recent wins.

The model has the Steelers covering the spread in 57% of simulations. Bet it at bet365 here : Brewers +160 vs. Dodgers While Los Angeles has taken a commanding 2-0 lead in the NLCS, there are still some things to be concerned about from a Dodgers perspective. Three MVPs in Shohei Ohtani, Mookie Betts and Freddie Freeman are 4-for-24 (.167) in the series with just one home run and three RBIs, and the Los Angeles bullpen continues to be a major concern. The Brewers won all six of their meetings with the Dodgers in the regular season, defeating Game 3 starter Tyler Glasnow twice. Milwaukee wins in 48% of simulations on Thursday night, providing clear value as a lengthy underdog. Bet it at bet365 now : Mariners -125 vs. Blue Jays Toronto got back in the series with a decisive victory on Wednesday night, but it turns to 41-year-old pitcher Max Scherzer on Thursday. The three-time Cy Young Award winner is past his prime, going 5-5 with a 5.19 ERA during the regular season. Additionally, he has not made a start this postseason, so he has not pitched since Sept. 24. Mariners starter Luis Castillo went 11-8 with a 3.54 ERA in the regular season and has not allowed a run across six innings this postseason.

e38a04299ef4,"NFL Week 7 picks, plus trades that need to happen and predictions for Bengals vs. Steelers on Thursday night",,"CINCINNATI -- Welcome to the Thursday edition of the Pick Six newsletter! If 40 truly is the new 30, we're going to find out tonight when the two oldest starting quarterbacks in the NFL face off. It will be 41-year-old Aaron Rodgers starting for the Steelers against 40-year-old Joe Flacco and the Bengals . Once you hit 40, it's not easy to stay up past 9:30 p.m. ET, but both of these guys will have to do that tonight. This will mark just the second time in NFL history that two quarterbacks over the age of 40 have faced off . (The only other time it happened came in 2020, when Tom Brady played against Drew Brees three different times.) The only thing more exciting than Flacco vs. Rodgers is the fact that I'll be at the game when it kicks off at 8:15 p.m. ET tonight from Paycor Stadium. In today's newsletter, we'll have some picks and best bets for the game, plus we'll take a look at one trade that each contender should make. As always, here's your reminder to tell all your friends to sign up for the newsletter . Let's get to the rundown. 1. Thursday night preview: Picks and best bets for Steelers at Bengals USATSI The 4-1 Steelers can't officially clinch the AFC North tonight, but if they win this game, the NFL might want to go ahead and give them the title, because there's a good chance no one is going to catch them. At 2-4, the Bengals are currently the second-place team in the division, and if they lose, the Steelers will have a commanding 3.5-game lead just seven weeks into the season. Of course, this might not be an easy win for the Steelers, and here's why: Joe Flacco has 11 wins against Mike Tomlin, which is the second most of any QB in NFL history. Also, the Steelers have never won a Thursday road game against a division opponent (0-8) . Both of those things will certainly add some intrigue to tonight's game. Here's one reason why each team should be feeling confident going into the game: Why the Steelers can win: The Steelers should feel confident about their ability to move the ball, and that's because they'll be going up against one of the worst defenses in the NFL. The Bengals are surrendering 394.2 yards per game this year, which is the most in the AFC and second most in the NFL. Cincinnati has also given up the third-most points. Basically, you can move the ball on this defense -- good news for a Steelers offense that has struggled to move the ball this year. Why the Bengals can win: The Bengals will be going into this game with the AFC North's leading passer -- yep, Joe Flacco leads the division in passing yards heading into Week 7 -- and that fact should have Cincinnati feeling good. The Steelers are surrendering 245 yards per game through the air this year, and if Flacco can take advantage of that, the Bengals will have a puncher's chance of winning. You can get a full preview of the game from Jared Dubin . If you're thinking about betting on the game, here are a couple of props (odds via BetMGM ): ONE RECEIVING PROP I LIKE: Tee Higgins OVER 46.5 receiving yards (-115): In his first game with Joe Flacco, Higgins finished with 62 yards against the Packers on Sunday -- and that was after just three days of practice with his new quarterback. Flacco has made it clear he's going to target Chase and Higgins, and since the Steelers will likely look to slow down Chase, that could set up Higgins to have a big game. ONE KICKING PROP I LIKE: Evan McPherson OVER 6.5 points (+100): McPherson has only gone over this number once all season, so this is definitely a risky bet. But here's why I like it: The Bengals offense actually looked functional with Joe Flacco running the show in Week 6, and I think we'll see more of that in Week 7. If the offense is able to move the ball, that should set up plenty of scoring chances for McPherson. If you're wondering how my props are doing this year, I'm 15-12 (6-6 on kicker props and 9-6 on all other props). And now, it's time for some picks. PICKS FOR 'TNF' Jared Dubin's pick: Steelers 21-16 over Bengals Pete Prisco's pick: Steelers 33-26 over Bengals Tyler Sullivan's pick: Steelers 24-20 over Bengals Jordan Dajani's pick: Steelers 21-17 over Bengals My pick: Bengals 23-20 over Steelers We've got some more picks over on our CBSSports.com predictions page . 2. NFL trade deadline is coming: One trade each contender should make before Nov. 4 The NFL trade deadline is officially less than three weeks away. It's set for Nov. 4, and there's a good chance we'll see quite a few deals between now and then. For contending teams, this will be their last opportunity to add a key player before the stretch run. With that in mind, Garrett Podell came up with one trade that each contender should make. Here are three trades from his list: Chargers acquire Alvin Kamara from the Saints . Justin Herbert could use some help -- particularly a reliable check-down option given his depleted offensive line. Saints running back Alvin Kamara could help Herbert and the Chargers both on the ground and through the air. The five-time Pro Bowler's 595 career catches are the fourth most in NFL history by a running back. Kamara is now 30 years old, and New Orleans is off to a 1-5 start in Kellen Moore 's first season as the Saints' coach. 49ers acquire Trey Hendrickson from the Bengals. The 49ers have the framework of a team that can compete in the wide-open NFC, but they desperately need help along the defensive front without Nick Bosa (torn ACL). Hendrickson could be the perfect rental to fill the void left by Bosa's injury, and San Francisco has the cap space -- $21.2 million, according to OverTheCap.com -- to absorb the final year of the four-time Pro Bowler's contract. Steelers acquire DeAndre Hopkins from the Ravens . The acquisition cost for Hopkins shouldn't be high given his age, and the Ravens likely won't need his services much longer, with one of football's worst defenses making it nearly impossible for any quarterback to win games. It seems like a win-win for two bitter AFC North rivals, with Baltimore getting a pick back for a 33-year-old receiver on a one-year deal. Podell's list includes a total of 18 trades, and you can check out each one here . 3. NFL Week 7 picks: Jaguars pull off upset in London, Eagles lose third straight USATSI Welcome to the part of the newsletter where we hand out picks. We have four NFL writers - Pete Prisco, Jordan Dajani, Tyler Sullivan and myself - making selections this week. Last week was big because Prisco's three-week reign as the top picker finally came to an end. He was starting to get insufferable, so I was glad to see Sullivan and Dajani both knock him off by going 10-5 with their picks in Week 6 (Prisco and I went 9-6). Anyway, if you're new here, here's how things work: I'll give you one Week 7 pick from each writer and then link you to the rest of their picks for the week. That way, if you like their pick, you can click over and check out all their Week 7 selections. If you hate it, you can ignore the rest and move on with your life. Pete Prisco -- Jaguars (+3) 24-21 over Rams . ""This is a long trip for a beat-up Chargers team that didn't play well in the second half last week in their loss to the Commanders . The Dolphins are coming off a bad loss to the Panthers . Their defense has struggled to stop the run, but the Chargers have injury issues on their line and in the backfield. The Dolphins will win this one behind a good game by Tua Tagovailoa ."" Prisco's full Week 7 picks are here . Tyler Sullivan -- Vikings (+1.5) 23-20 over Eagles. ""It's hard for me to back the Eagles at this stage, particularly on the road. The offense continues to look lost and is averaging just 274.5 yards per game (third-fewest in the NFL). The club has been outgained in every game this season and has been outscored 52-17 in the last five quarters."" Sullivan's full Week 7 picks are here . Jordan Dajani -- Cowboys (+1.5) 31-30 over Commanders. ""What do we make of the Cowboys? They are 1-1-1 with 104 points scored and zero turnovers in their last three games. Dak Prescott has thrown 10 touchdowns with zero interceptions over the last three weeks, and he's 34-9 SU and 30-12-1 ATS in his career vs. NFC East opponents. ... I expect plenty of points in this matchup, but give me the home dog."" Dajani's full slate of picks will be released Friday, but here's an early preview of his predictions. John Breech -- Colts (+1.5) 34-27 over Chargers. ""This seems like a game where Jonathan Taylor could go off. The NFL's leading rusher gets to face a Chargers defense that's surrendering nearly 125 yards per game on the ground."" You can find the rest of my Week 7 picks here .

NFL Week 7 upset alert: 3 favorites who could go down Last week ended with two big upsets on Monday night ( Falcons over Bills and Bears over Commanders), and there's nothing I love more than a big upset, so I'm hoping those shocking finishes carry over into Week 7. So, who should be on upset alert this week? Tyler Sullivan is here to tell us. Buccaneers (+5.5) over Lions . The Bucs wide receiver group is dinged up, with Mike Evans , Chris Godwin and Emeka Egbuka all questionable. However, even if one of them suits up in Week 7, that could be enough for Baker Mayfield to have similar results that Patrick Mahomes had a week ago. Speaking of Mayfield, his 12 upset wins since joining the Buccaneers are the most in the NFL (since 2023). Falcons (+2.5) over 49ers. The 49ers ailing defense just lost Fred Warner and will now be facing a Falcons offense that has explosive playmakers like Drake London and Bijan Robinson at their disposal to help exploit their deficiencies. Atlanta is fresh off an upset win over Buffalo, and has done well in this spot. The Falcons have won four of their last five prime-time games, including a 2-0 record this season. Dolphins (+3) over Browns . The Browns offense continues to be middling even after the switch to Dillon Gabriel at quarterback. Over the last two weeks, Gabriel's completion percentage (57%) and yards per attempt (4.8) are last in the NFL. If that continues, this will be a tight enough game where one or two throws from Tagovailoa could be enough to pull away. This is the first game Cleveland is favored this season, after going 0-4 as a favorite in 2024. Check out Sullivan's full list of possible upsets for Week 7 . 5. QB rankings heading into Week 7: Baker Mayfield is inching closer and closer to the top CBS Sports design Every week during the NFL season, Cody Benjamin goes through and ranks every quarterback in the league. This week, his rankings have been turned upside down by none other than Baker Mayfield. Going into Week 6, Mayfield wasn't even in the top five, but after leading the Buccaneers to another impressive win, the former No. 1 overall pick is now just ONE SPOT away from the top. Let's check out the top three names on Benjamin's list: 1. Josh Allen , Bills. He didn't have a game to write home about in a surprise loss to the Falcons, the Bills' second straight prime-time slip-up. He's still the most dangerous playmaker at the position, especially when Lamar Jackson isn't suiting up. 2. Baker Mayfield, Buccaneers. It's probably time to throw his name into the MVP ring. Even with countless injuries depleting his supporting cast, Mayfield is playing with a warrior's mentality, both as a timely scrambler and rip-roaring passer. He is the Buccaneers right now. 3. Jared Goff , Lions. Detroit's typically high-octane attack was undone by a pair of failed fourth-down tries against the Chiefs . But Goff has remained a clean distributor when afforded a clean pocket, leading the NFL in completion rate (75.9%). The QB who made the biggest jump this week was actually BRYCE YOUNG , and if you want to see where he ended up (or if you just want to see Benjamin's full rankings), you can do that here . 6. Extra points: Chiefs offer no details on mysterious absence of Josh Simmons It's been a busy 24 hours in the NFL, and since it's nearly impossible to keep track of everything that happened, I went ahead and put together a roundup for you. Chiefs mum on status of first-round pick Josh Simmons. The Chiefs' rookie missed Kansas City's Week 6 game against Detroit after abruptly leaving the team over the weekend. Simmons didn't practice Wednesday, and right now, it's not clear why he's out or how long he might be away from the team. ""I'm not going to comment on it today,"" Chiefs head coach Andy Reid said Wednesday. ""[General Manager Brett] Veach is handling everything there -- and we'll leave it at that."" You can read more about the Simmons situation here . Chargers wearing all gold uniforms for first time ever . The Chargers unveiled an all-gold uniform over the summer, and they'll be wearing that uniform for the first time ever Sunday against the Colts. If you want to check out their new look, you can see it here . Brian Branch loses appeal. The Lions safety will have to sit out this week's game against the Buccaneers after losing the appeal over his one-game suspension . Branch was suspended for starting a fight with several Chiefs' players following Detroit's loss to Kansas City in Week 6. Rams are practicing on an MLB field this week. After playing the Ravens in Week 6, the Rams decided to stick around in Baltimore before heading over to London for their Week 7 game against the Jaguars. The Rams ended up using Camden Yards as their practice base this week, and you can check them out taking the field here .",https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/nfl-week-7-picks-plus-trades-that-need-to-happen-and-predictions-for-bengals-vs-steelers-on-thursday-night,Sport,cbssports.com,,https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2025/10/16/0acb3bb0-8144-41ea-ae19-9c4eeab33cfd/thumbnail/1200x675/ac7cead1d249f737d8b1582900f8270b/joe-flacco.jpg,2025-10-16T17:02:13+00:00,1b2729dcb1dde4f7dc412b2dedf407a2fbc22c4c
d728cff2a69b,2025 NFL trade deadline: Which wide receivers could Patriots target for Drake Maye?,"patriots, nfl trade deadline, drake maye, aj brown, chris olave, nfl trade rumors, jakobi meyers, nfl trades","The NFL is rocketing towards the Nov. 4 trade deadline, and teams now have to determine if they are going to be buyers or sellers. One team that has catapulted in recent weeks into buyer status is the New England Patriots . Mike Vrabel's club is entering Week 7 on a three-game win streak, which included an upset win over the Buffalo Bills on the road that has since helped them elevate to first place in the AFC East. On top of already matching their win total (four) from the previous two seasons, New England has second-year quarterback Drake Maye putting up numbers that have him circling the MVP conversation . So, with an emerging young quarterback at the helm and currently holding the inside track on a division title, the Patriots could look to bolster their roster leading up to the deadline. One area they could focus on, as highlighted by CBS Sports NFL Insider Jonathan Jones , is wide receiver. ""New England has needed a wide receiver for some time,"" Jones said on CBS Sports HQ this week. ""The truth of the matter is, you have Drake Maye on his rookie contract, and he will continue to be one of the best bargains in sports, so long as the rookie wage scale exists in the NFL, and you have a great quarterback like they have in young Drake Maye, the Tar Heel. So, wide receiver is something they could continue to use. ""...The Patriots have the AFC East division crown in their sights for the first time for the better part of a half-decade. They want to get there; they're going to need more wide receiver help, not just this year, but beyond. That is why they've been wanting to make a deal for a wide receiver, and they hope to make one before the Nov. 4 trade deadline."" 2025 NFL trade deadline: Top players at each position who could be dealt, including Alvin Kamara, Mark Andrews Jeff Kerr So, who could the Patriots target to be the newest weapon for Maye? Let's identify four targets. This is the obvious and most talked-about target when it comes to the Patriots dealing for a receiver. Mike Vrabel was the head coach of the Tennessee Titans when Brown was drafted by the franchise in 2019, and the two reportedly still have a strong connection. When Tennessee traded Brown to the Eagles in 2022, Vrabel was visibly distraught by the deal . So, one would think that both Brown and Vrabel would welcome a reunion. Meanwhile, Brown has been vocal about his displeasure with his role in the Eagles offense, which has led to trade speculation heating up. If things reach a point of no return between Philadelphia and Brown, the Patriots make a lot of sense as a trade partner. While a Brown trade sounds like a logical blockbuster to keep an eye on, it's worth noting that he carries massive dead cap money. This season, Brown's dead cap charge is a little over $90 million. In 2026, it's $72.5 million before it gets to a more palatable place in 2027 and beyond. That'd be a hard pill for Philadelphia to swallow in the middle of a Super Bowl window. New England saw firsthand what Olave is capable of as the Saints receiver posted a game-high 98 yards receiving on six catches (10 targets) in their Week 6 matchup in New Orleans. With the Saints sitting at 1-5 on the season and seemingly on the verge of a full roster rebuild, it may make sense for them to collect up assets by dealing a player like Olave, who may not be on their timeline. The 2022 first-round pick out of Ohio State is still playing on his rookie deal, but the Saints did pick up his fifth-year option, which means he's under team control through the 2026 season. However, Olave would most likely look for a long-term extension this offseason. If the Saints aren't enamored with the idea of inking Olave, who has dealt with various concussions throughout his young career, to a deal this offseason, it'd make sense to move him now to get peak value. In a similar vein to Olave, Shaheed could be on the move for New Orleans as well. The 27-year-old is set to be a free agent this offseason, so the Saints could look to get some draft pick compensation for him at the deadline before possibly losing him on the open market. Shaheed is a downfield burner that would add a different layer to New England's offense with most of their pass catchers working as possession receivers. Shaheed could also have some appeal to the Patriots for his play in the return game as well, particularly after losing Antonio Gibson for the year. One of the themes throughout New England's offseason roster building was that they brought in a lot of players who had familiarity with figures on Vrabel's coaching staff. They could continue to follow that theme at the deadline by looking to acquire Jakobi Meyers from the Las Vegas Raiders . Of course, Meyers began his career with the Patriots as an undrafted free agent out of NC State in 2019 and worked well within Josh McDaniels' offense both as a member of the Patriots and with the Raiders. Unlike these other receivers mentioned, the learning curve for Meyers would be minuscule if he were brought back to New England thanks to his experience playing under McDaniels.

Bet it at DraftKings here : Steelers -5.5 vs. Bengals (-110) The Steelers enter on a three-game winning streak, both straight up and against the spread, against a Bengals team desperate for offensive answers with Joe Burrow (toe) sidelined for a significant part of the season. The Bengals' latest attempt at offensive consistency came via trading for 40-year-old Joe Flacco roughly a week after the veteran was benched by the Browns due to his performance. Flacco had two touchdowns and six interceptions in his four games in Cleveland. He threw for 219 yards in his Bengals debut but averaged just 4.9 yards per attempt in a 27-18 loss to the Packers. The Bengals are 29th in scoring offense (17.2 ppg) and 30th in scoring defense (30.5 ppg), as the model projects the Steelers to cover in 57% of simulations. Back the Steelers at DraftKings, where new users get $300 in bonus bets and 3 free months of NBA League Pass : Brewers to defeat the Dodgers (+163) The Brewers had the best record in baseball at 97-65 this season, so despite being down 2-0 in the series, the model doesn't expect Milwaukee to just fade away. The Brewers also had the best road record (45-36), so traveling to Los Angeles shouldn't be an intimidating task. Road teams are 5-0 in the ALCS and NLCS entering Thursday, in a strange trend, but another factor to create value Milwaukee's way. The Dodgers are starting Tyler Glasnow, who has only made 18 starts this season due to multiple injuries. The Brewers had the third-best scoring offense at 4.98 runs per game during the regular season, and the model projects value in them in this crucial matchup. The Brewers win in 48% of the model's simulations, compared to implied odds of 38.02%, showcasing strong value in backing Milwaukee on Thursday. Back the Brewers at DraftKings Sportsbook, where new users get $300 in bonus bets and 3 free months of NBA League Pass : East Carolina vs. Tulsa Under 53.5 total points (-105) Both teams have gone Under their over/under totals in five of six games this season, including East Carolina going Under in four straight games and Tulsa finishing Under in three straight contests. They have combined to go Under in four of five American Athletic Conference games this season. East Carolina is 88th in the nation in scoring (23 ppg) while Tulsa ranks 124th (15.4 ppg). The Pirates have the No. 18 scoring defense (18 ppg) this season, as the model doesn't expect Tulsa's struggling offense to find much success against East Carolina.

After rolling his ankle late in last week's win over Boston College , coach Dabo Swinney labeled Klubnik as ""hour-to-hour."" Speaking Wednesday night with reporters, Swinney said Klubnik has been ""limited"" in practice. The Tigers quarterback has been dealing with soreness all week, but Swinney said Klubnik has made good progress. ""Just been limited,"" Swinney said of Klubnik's status . ""We're taking our time with him. Like I said yesterday, he's gone from day-to-day to hour-to-hour. Hopefully tomorrow he'll be minute-to-minute. … Literally getting better every hour. Just being smart with him, and he's been doing what he needed to do."" Klubnik tweaked his ankle in the second half of the Tigers' 41-10 win over the Eagles, and Swinney said the team elected to hold him out at that point. After the game, Swinney said Klubnik was already dealing with nagging soreness on that ankle. ""He'd been nursing a little bit of a sore ankle anyway,"" Swinney said. ""You've probably seen it taped up."" With so much uncertainty surrounding Klubnik's status for this game, the spread has shifted quite a bit toward the Mustangs. The Tigers opened as 10-point favorites, but that line dropped to 5.5, according to FanDuel Sportsbook . After a slow start to the season, Klubnik led Clemson to consecutive wins over North Carolina and Boston College. In those two games, he threw for a combined 534 yards and five touchdowns. Clemson will offer a more concrete update on Klubnik's status Thursday night when the first ACC availability report of the week gets released. If Klubnik is unable to play against Boston College, redshirt sophomore Christopher Vizzina would get the start. A four-star recruit in the 2023 signing class, Vizzina has thrown for 227 yards and one interception on 26-of-48 passing in his career.",https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/news/clemson-qb-cade-klubnik-limited-in-practice-with-ankle-injury-ahead-of-smu-game,Sport,cbssports.com,,https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2025/10/16/e59f8f47-f764-48da-8af2-b2184d1f2bbe/thumbnail/1200x675/739374648fc684cab643cbe42d8e3f3e/gettyimages-2240432274-3.jpg,2025-10-16T16:47:23+00:00,e45a11bf0cb3bf147ed2c8ff3899c6c446b42532
0dda801be052,Broncos LB Jonathon Cooper unfazed by Giants rookie sensation Jaxson Dart: 'Ain't nothing we haven't seen',"jaxson dart, denver broncos, new york giants","New York Giants rookie quarterback Jaxson Dart has forced NFL defenses to take notice in recent weeks, posting wins in two of his three starts while averaging 55.6 yards rushing per game with two touchdowns on the ground. His ability to extend plays with his legs and escape pressure has become a defining feature of the young quarterback's game. But ahead of Sunday's matchup against the Denver Broncos , linebacker Jonathon Cooper isn't fazed by the hype. The reigning AFC Defensive Player of the Week said Dart's mobility won't catch Denver off guard. ""He's a young guy. He's feelin' himself a little bit,"" Cooper said. ""He's out there running around. He's got the chain on. He's dancing. I feel like everybody needs something, you know. But we've went against QBs who have ran around in the pocket and have tried to do stuff with their legs, so it ain't nothing we haven't seen ."" The Broncos certainly know how to defend mobile quarterbacks, limiting scramblers Jalen Hurts and Justin Fields to a combined 34 yards on nine carries over the past two weeks. Denver leads the league with 30 sacks this season, including nine against Fields and the Jets in London last Sunday. Containing Dart will require consistent pressure without losing discipline in the defensive lanes. Asked if Dart's rookie status and limited film made the matchup more challenging, Cooper disagreed. ""I would say no, not to that standpoint, just because once you've played enough in this league and seen enough good quarterbacks -- we play one of the best quarterbacks twice a year, every single year -- you kind of get a feel of the game and know what you need to do,"" Cooper said. ""You've got to make them feel uncomfortable in the pocket. You can't let them get that confidence and that ego going. You just have to take care of that."" Dart and first-year running back Cam Skattebo have given the Giants offense a spark since Dart became the starter in Week 4. His performance in a 34-17 win against the defending Super Bowl champion Philadelphia Eagles last Thursday highlighted his dual-threat ability, completing 17 of 25 passes for 195 yards with a touchdown while adding 58 yards rushing and another score on 13 carries. Still, New York faces a formidable challenge in Denver. In addition to leading the NFL in sacks, the Broncos rank second in points allowed per game (15.8), sixth in rushing yards allowed (89.0), and third in passing yards allowed (165.2). Nik Bonitto leads the NFL with eight sacks, while Cooper has contributed 18 total tackles, including four for loss with 4.5 sacks through six games.",https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/broncos-lb-jonathon-cooper-unfazed-giants-jaxson-dart-aint-nothing-we-havent-seen,Sport,cbssports.com,,https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2025/10/16/8c0512a9-8512-49a1-be03-b1806998f0a2/thumbnail/1200x675/aa368070abaf2d05c174ad99469c5cc7/jaxson-dart-giants.jpg,2025-10-16T16:44:00+00:00,fa6e9f96473c788a14ec39a9eaf742b2833fa73d

The defense looks a lot better now that it's healthier, but it was healthy in Week 1 when it got gashed by a Jets team that is 50-50 to complete a forward pass most weeks,"" CBS Sports Gambling and Fantasy editor R.J. White said. ""The 5.1 yards per play on offense is comparable to the Panthers and Raiders.

However, he does have a 4.55 career ERA against Milwaukee and the Brewers have only been beaten by two runs or more twice during the 2025 MLB Playoffs.

8f1ba502c977,NFL Week 8 lookahead lines: Early best bets worth considering now before Week 7 kicks off,"nfl week 8, nfl betting, nfl gambling, nfl week 8 odds, nfl week 8 lookahead lines, nfl week 8 early bets, nfl expert picks, nfl expert best bets, nfl expert week 8 picks","Week 7 kicks off Thursday with the Steelers facing the Bengals in Cincinnati and ends with a 10 p.m. ET Monday night matchup between the Texans and Seahawks in Houston. Both games have moved a point from their lookahead spreads at some books and the Seahawks movement involves a key number, meaning that anyone that bet Seattle prior to last Sunday's kickoff was able to lock in an advantageous line under 3, a common margin of victory. When looking ahead at spreads to bet early, key numbers should be a major factor in what you play. We liked the Bengals +4.5 on the lookahead and even those it's moved up since, there isn't much difference between 4.5 and 5.5 as 5 is what's known as a dead number, meaning an uncommon margin of victory. The value in getting 4.5 instead of even 4, however, was worth the risk of watching the number move up through the dead 5. Let's take a look at the consensus Week 8 lookahead lines and then share our best bets to lock in early. Week 8 lookahead lines Vikings at Chargers (-3), 43 Bills (-7) at Panthers , 48.5 Dolphins at Falcons (-6), 46 Giants at Eagles (-7.5), 41.5 Bears at Ravens (-6.5), 49.5 Browns at Patriots (-7), 40.5 Jets at Bengals (-2.5), 42.5 49ers at Texans (-1.5), 43.5 Buccaneers (-5.5) at Saints , 47.5 Cowboys at Broncos (-4.5), 47.5 Titans at Colts (-11.5), 44.5 Packers (-3) at Steelers, 43.5 Commanders at Chiefs (-5.5), 51 Week 8 lookahead picks Dolphins at Falcons The Dolphins have a road matchup with a team that can run the ball well while leaning on an excellent defense to limit Miami from scoring much, and I think there's a good chance the Browns give them trouble in the matchup. The Falcons profile as a similar but better team, and if the Dolphins flop against the Browns I think this can open at -6.5 or even -7 before Atlanta squares off with the 49ers on Sunday Night Football. If the Falcons win that game, it shouldn't take long for this line to boost to a full touchdown, so this appears the best time to jump aboard. Giants at Eagles We just saw this matchup last week and the Eagles certainly didn't look like the better team on the field that day. They have a tough matchup on the road against the Vikings this week and a third straight loss would have people grabbing the Giants with the points at 7 or higher, even if the Giants struggle in Denver. This might be a game to try and middle, taking the +7.5 now and seeing if we can play the Eagles back at a much smaller number depending on what happens Sunday. Jets at Bengals We saw the Jets open as favorites at home against Carolina before the market pushed them to underdog status, which tells you about the state of the Jets. If they show any life in that game, I expect there to be interest grabbing them as 'dogs in this matchup, doubly so if the Bengals flop on Thursday night against the Steelers. In these matchups between two bad teams, you're not going to get one as a big favorite, so there's value backing the 'dog and seeing if the current week's results cause a big shift like it did with the Panthers-Jets game. Other notes: Neither the Texans nor the 49ers will have played by the time lines reopen on Sunday evening, but I see that line as a little short considering the 49ers' injury issues on defense with Fred Warner out for the year. But the Texans could also struggle offensively in a tough matchup, so there's potential for Texans -1.5 to become Texans -3 or go the other way and have the 49ers favored. It feels like early bettors will have good value on one side of the spread, but it's hard to predict which side that is ... The lookahead for Bears-Ravens is Ravens -6.5 with Baltimore coming out of its bye and expected to have Lamar Jackson back. There might be value fading their return if the defensive injuries still look like an issue, and Chicago could be coming off a fourth straight win as heavy favorites against the Saints this weekend. This feels like a good spot to take the 6.5 with Chicago and see if the number next week is closer to 3 than 7.",https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/nfl-week-8-lookahead-lines-early-best-bets-worth-considering-now-before-week-7-kicks-off,Sport,cbssports.com,,https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2025/10/14/5ed65a3f-cad8-41d6-acaa-43395d2cbf28/thumbnail/1200x675/2abb0edcf0a5890ce111264459f09ca9/skattebo-dart-giants-imagn-cbs.jpg,2025-10-16T16:36:39+00:00,b3e0498401f42e092e240b64fae9cd94f3a9ac09

In the first matchup, the Rockets clash with the defending NBA champion Thunder, followed by a Pacific Division matchup between the Warriors and Lakers. That means the 2025 Fantasy basketball rankings are taking shape, and the latest Fantasy basketball ADP listing has Denver's Nikola Jokic, Oklahoma City's Shai Gilgeous-Alexander and San Antonio's Victor Wembanyama as consensus top picks. Before making any drafting decisions, you need to be able to trust your picks at the top of any Fantasy basketball draft. To do that, you need to identify those 2025 Fantasy basketball sleepers, breakouts and busts. That's where the 2025 Fantasy basketball rankings and cheat sheets are necessary from the proven computer model at SportsLine. Before making any 2025-26 Fantasy basketball picks, be sure to check out the 2025 Fantasy basketball rankings and cheat sheets from the proven computer model at SportsLine . LIMITED TIME: Use promo code CHAMPIONSHIP to get your first month at SportsLine for $1 JOIN NOW . SportsLine's proven model simulates each season 10,0000 times. This model is powered by the same people who powered projections for all three major Fantasy sites. These cheat sheets and rankings, available for leagues on many major sites, are updated multiple times every day. Last year the model called a breakout season for Stephon Castle, predicting that he would finish 25 spots ahead of consensus ADP at his position. The result: Castle won NBA Rookie of the year honors after averaging 14.7 points, 4.1 assists and 3.7 rebounds per game and finished as the No. 51 guard in average Fantasy points per game. The model also nailed James Harden as a sleeper last year before he put together his first All-Star season in three years and called Paolo Banchero's and Victor Wembanyama's breakout seasons before they went on to win NBA Rookie of the Year honors as well. Now, SportsLine has simulated the entire NBA season 10,000 times and released its latest Fantasy basketball rankings 2025-26, along with plenty of sleepers, breakouts and busts. Head to SportsLine now to see these 2025-26 Fantasy basketball rankings . Top 2025 Fantasy basketball sleepers One of the top 2025 Fantasy basketball sleepers the model is predicting: Milwaukee Bucks guard Kevin Porter Jr., who is barely being picked in the top 100 picks in many drafts. Despite struggling from deep through the first 45 games of last season with the Los Angeles Clippers, he turned things around in a big way once he was acquired by the Bucks. He finished the regular season connecting on 40.8% of his 3-pointers in his final 30 games with Milwaukee, averaging 11.7 points per game. In the postseason, he continued to light it up from deep, hitting on 46.7% of his 3-pointers, averaging 11.2 points in five games. Porter is expected to be the Bucks' starting point guard, and is just one of two players on the 2025-26 roster to average 2.9 assists or more. For his career, Porter has averaged 4.6 assists per game. See more Fantasy basketball sleepers 2025 here . Top 2025 Fantasy basketball breakouts One of the 2025 Fantasy basketball breakouts the model has identified: Jazz point guard Isaiah Collier, who has an ADP of 137. The No. 1 ranked prospect in the Class of 2023, Collier starred at USC for one season before being the 29th overall pick by Utah in 2024. He began as a backup but then wrestled the starting job away from Keyonte George, who was an All-Rookie selection the year prior. Collier really hit his stride towards the end of the season and averaged 15.9 points and 7.1 assists over his final seven games of his rookie year. Already one of the league's youngest teams, Utah then jettisoned vets Jordan Clarkson, Collin Sexton and John Collins in the offseason as it has fully embraced a youth movement. Thus, the 21-year-old Collier should have no shortage of opportunities, and he plays in an offense conducive for lots of stats. The Jazz ranked fifth in pace last season as they want to utilize those young legs to their advantage. The model slots Collier ahead of Klay Thompson and Jalen Suggs, despite those two being drafted earlier on average. Identify other Fantasy basketball breakouts 2025 here . Top 2025 Fantasy basketball busts As for players to avoid, the model lists Pelicans guard Jordan Poole as a Fantasy basketball bust. Poole was acquired by the New Orleans Pelicans from the Washington Wizards during the offseason. Despite his somewhat lofty numbers, he finds himself in a situation where he needs to be a complementary piece to Zion Williamson. He also may have to take a lesser role behind New Orleans' two lottery picks in Derik Queen and Jeremiah Fears. If they emerge in their rookie seasons, Poole could definitely see his production go down. Poole is being picked in the seventh round, according to the latest ADP, but he may not be worth taking. In fact, SportsLine's model has players such as Jrue Holiday and Immanuel Quickly, both of whom are projected by many to be picked later, as better values. Avoid these 2025 Fantasy basketball busts as well . How to find proven 2025-26 Fantasy basketball rankings SportsLine is also extremely high on a surprising forward you aren't even thinking about being taken in the early rounds of 2025 Fantasy basketball drafts.

4a00a3d1b8b1,"Ballon d'Or 2026 Power Rankings: Kylian Mbappe leads the way; injuries drop Lamine Yamal, Ousmane Dembele",,"We remain in the very, very early stages of this season but what is a running assessment of the best players on the planet if you don't keep it regularly updated? With the Champions League heating up and World Cup qualifying having afforded big name players a chance to shine, it could be all change at the top of our rankings. Well, actually it's not. What might be more intriguing, however, is what is happening lower down the list, where there is, for instance, no Mohamed Salah after his wobbly start to the season. Vinicius Junior is also on the up while Barcelona players are paying the price for injuries. Let's get into these before I give any more away. 1. Kylian Mbappe , Real Madrid (--) Apologies to those of you who come into this with a no-spoilers mindset but look, we shouldn't act like there isn't a clear top three emerging at the very start of this race. Right now, it's Kylian Mbappe, Erling Haaland, Harry Kane , and the field. How exactly those three project over the months ahead is up in the air, but there are just a few signs that Mbappe should be the favorite just now. For starters, his non-penalty expected goals (npxG) in league and European play is second only to the man at No. 2 in these rankings, but the Real Madrid man is doing way more creatively, more than double the expected assists (xA) and six times as many chances created for others. Even that only puts a hair's breadth between Mbappe and the other two, and so we may need to look ahead at the criteria that might separate these players come the end of the season. That could be team success, and right now Real Madrid seem a slightly likelier bet to win the Champions League than Manchester City and Bayern Munich , as France are probably greater favorites for the World Cup than England . This column is firmly of the view that the Ballon d'Or should be awarded to the best performing player of the season rather than someone who has collected the most silverware. But performing at the highest level and winning the biggest prizes? That should do it. Mbappe seems better poised to achieve that than anyone else. 2. Erling Haaland, Manchester City (--) A month ago, we described the 1.52 npxG per 90 averaged by Haaland as ""ludicrous."" That it was, and Haaland's numbers have regressed to the norm significantly in the last few games. He is still averaging 1.08 npxG per 90, only now he has hit a bit of a hot streak and is outperforming that. In Premier League and Champions League, he finds the net every 64 minutes, scoring as many in the top flight as 12 other teams. U wot m8? This might actually continue, by the way. The evidence of the first two months of the season is that Pep Guardiola's tactical starting point is ""how can we get more shots for Erling Haaland."" In all, the big Norwegian has taken nearly 30% of City's shots and accounts for over 57% of their xG. No wonder when his xG per shot is 0.25, meaning his average shot is what most stats providers would label a big chance. So long as City can keep putting him in the right spots, there is a vanishingly small number of defenders and goalkeepers who can stop Haaland. 3. Harry Kane, Bayern Munich (--) In pure output terms, Kane is at least the equal of the two players above him. For Bayern Munich, he has 17 goals and three assists in 2025-26, while his three goals in qualifying have been a big help in England becoming the first European side to book their spot at the World Cup. You might even make the case that, on pure output right now, Kane is the best player in the world. Harry Kane's shots for Bayern Munich in 2025-26, sized by xG value TruMedia Why not have him one then? The error bars are just a smidge wider for him, is all. It's as you can see in the shot chart above, lots of tiny green smidges that show goals from low xG value positions. In all his 15 goals for Bayern in league and Europe have come from a smidge over 7.5 xG, and even a striker as good as Kane can only double his xG for so long. Half an npxG per 90 isn't to be sniffed at -- particularly when you're pairing it with 0.2 xA -- even if it is third on Bayern. Kane could well be very, very good for the remainder of this season. He just probably won't keep being this good. 4. Pedri , Barcelona (+1) Pedri probably isn't going to win the Ballon d'Or. There is always the odd Rodri-shaped exception, but these awards tend to go to attackers, somewhat understandably so. But if putting the ball in the net is the most valuable action on a football pitch, then dictating the course of a contest can't be far behind. That, of course, means manipulating possession, and Pedri is a ball progressing master on the level of Vitinha and Joshua Kimmich . Defensive actions made by Pedri in the 2025-26 La Liga and Champions League TruMedia What separates Pedri from the rest is apparent in that graphic above. Just look at how often he is getting the ball back and how often he is doing so high up the field. The 22 year old has developed into an elite player without the ball, recovering possession more frequently than anyone in Europe's top five leagues. Among defensive midfielders he ranks in the top 10 for duels and top 30 for interceptions. It is fair to ask whether Barcelona's high wire act of a defensive line can work without Pedri. If they achieve big things this season, you suspect he will deserve more flowers than he gets. 5. Michael Olise , Bayern Munich (+3) It says something indeed when a 23-year-old with just a dozen caps finds himself labelled one of the ""technical leaders"" of the French national team. Then again, William Saliba's description of Michael Olise seems fair enough, really. If you're not letting Olise lead your team, you're doing something wrong. After all, he has been doing exactly that in a Bayern Munich shirt to quite glorious effect. ""He brings a bit of 'craziness' to the team and has good technique,"" Saliba added. ""He's a cool guy, a bit nonchalant sometimes, which is funny."" Honestly, that nonchalance, familiar to Palace fans first and foremost, should be enough to have neutrals cheering on his Ballon d'Or candidacy. 6. Ousmane Dembele , Paris Saint-Germain (-2) There's a bit of a refrain to come in the back half of this list. It's just the injuries, mate. In discourse terms, if you're going to miss some games and still compete for the Ballon d'Or, these are the games to miss, long before World Cups and Champions Leagues are decided. This column, however, cares about aggregates and grand totals. A hamstring injury has kept Ousmane Dembele from building much in that regard. We shall have to see after his return if he can be the player who was so worthy of winning last season's Ballon d'Or. 7. Lamine Yamal , Barcelona (-1) In Lamine Yamal's case, there is another reason why it makes sense to ding his standings on the basis of injury. The groin issue that has hampered him early in the season has flared up again, causing a war of words between the Spanish national team and Barcelona. These particular sorts of injuries are relatively common among players making their first strides into the world of senior football, and it is often the case that the best treatment is extended rest. Best of luck convincing Barcelona to hold Yamal back with a Clasico on the horizon. There is a very fine line to tread here between easing the load on a player who has just turned 18 and not depriving your team of one of the best players in the world. That is what Yamal clearly is. You only need to see how he marked his brief return to action with a brilliant assist against Real Sociedad to have that affirmed for you. Give him a run of games at full fitness, and Yamal might just crash into the top of these rankings. 8. Vinicius Junior, Real Madrid (new entry) Remember all those questions over whether Xabi Alonso was all that keen on Vinicius Junior? Those seem to have been brushed aside, don't they? The Brazilian now ranks seventh among Real Madrid outfield players for total minutes played and has begun to make the left flank his own, holding width high up the field and creating more space for Mbappe to excel. Passes received by Vinicius Junior in 2024-25 and 2025-26 La Liga games, reflecting how much less possession he is getting away from the left wing TruMedia If that doesn't exactly scream biggest individual prizes in football, then an upswing on four assists and four goals this season might, particularly when his combined npxG and xA is at 0.76 per 90. We know that Vinicius can play at the level of a Ballon d'Or winner. Although it is less likely that he gets there in an attack geared for Mbappe, it would be unwise to discount it entirely. 9. Raphinha , Barcelona (-2) It is hoped that Raphinha's injury, one of a string that have rocked Barcelona this season, is to be a minor one given that the Brazilian started 2025-26 as he ended the previous campaign, three goals and two assists in seven games. The fear for both player and club will be that he is back in time for big games such as the Clasico; an extended absence that coincides with a run of results that takes Barcelona out of contention for La Liga would do no favors to the candidacy of a player who really should have ranked higher than fifth last season. 10. Bukayo Saka , Arsenal (new entry) Right now, you probably could not argue that Bukayo Saka has been one of the 10 best-performing players of the early weeks of the season. He has just been injured for too much of it. However, Arsenal have been very, very good when their best player has been sidelined for half their games. Suppose they continue to play as they are, perhaps even to a higher level with their best and brightest available. The Champions League would be winnable for them, as of course would the Premier League they currently top. Suppose one of those two comes to north London, it is hard to imagine that it happens without Arsenal's homegrown superstar being one of their best players. If so, why shouldn't he become the first English Ballon d'Or winner in a quarter of a century?",https://www.cbssports.com/soccer/news/ballon-dor-2026-power-rankings-kylian-mbappe-leads-the-way-injuries-drop-lamine-yamal-ousmane-dembele,Sport,cbssports.com,,https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2025/10/16/c0984dec-c044-46d3-b6bd-40556edc15b1/thumbnail/1200x675/207b85bba7e5044208b78fd14d19d238/mbappe.jpg,2025-10-16T16:28:00+00:00,59c7d91b6d9c7ee1a1dbed62a614fe36dec9cf3c
3018940e90e3,"Yankees' Anthony Volpe could miss start of 2026 season after shoulder surgery, plus more New York injury news",,"Getty Images New York Yankees shortstop Anthony Volpe underwent surgery Tuesday to repair a torn labrum in his left shoulder, manager Aaron Boone confirmed on Thursday during his yearly wrapup press conference. Volpe will not be allowed to dive on his shoulder for six months, suggesting that his availability for Opening Day 2026 could be impacted. Additionally, Boone revealed that outfielder Aaron Judge will not require surgery on his elbow, which limited his throwing ability down the stretch, and that lefty Carlos Rodón will have a bone spur removed on Friday and may be sidelined at the 2026 season's onset. Volpe's shoulder was a storyline throughout the season. He underwent imaging in early May after he experienced a ""pop"" on a fielding attempt . He never required a stint on the injured list, yet the Yankees revealed in September that he had reaggravated the shoulder on occasion -- and that he received a cortisone injection for maintenance purposes during the July All-Star break. ""I feel like he's been in a good spot physically,"" manager Aaron Boone said in September when asked if Volpe's shoulder injury had impacted his play. ""I think everybody deals with certain things, so it's impossible to say like this affected something this much or didn't at all. I don't how you can possibly know that, but I don't think it's been a major factor in his performance, or his ability to swing the bat, or his ability to go to the post every day. That's my sense."" While it's anyone's guess as to how much Volpe was or wasn't impacted by the shoulder, it's worth noting that he had posted a .768 OPS through the May 3 game in which he experienced the pop. From that point forward, he tallied a .632 OPS. Overall, Volpe batted .212/.272/.391 with 19 home runs and 18 stolen bases in 153 games this season. His 83 OPS+ was a tick below the 84 mark he posted over his first two years in the majors. His contributions were nonetheless estimated to have been worth 1.7 Wins Above Replacement.",https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/news/yankees-anthony-volpe-could-miss-start-of-2026-season-after-shoulder-surgery-plus-more-new-york-injury-news,Sport,cbssports.com,,https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2025/10/15/e1eec766-55e7-4f21-9673-440f7e6402b1/thumbnail/1200x675/281ad2e84eb1ec9c1b31e62a860ba804/volpe.jpg,2025-10-16T16:25:00+00:00,05a2906e444e56a3a08da2574593de5c59be09de

4e03dc34f149,Anderson Silva vs. Chris Weidman boxing match added to Jake Paul vs. Gervonta Davis undercard,,"Anderson Silva and Chris Weidman will go at it one more time. Former UFC middleweight champions Silva and Weidman have agreed to box on the undercard of Jake Paul vs. Gervonta ""Tank"" Davis, Most Valuable Promotions announced on Thursday. Silva vs. Weidman will take place at Kaseya Center in Miami on Nov. 14, according to a press release. The two will meet in a heavyweight fight set for six rounds and will open the Netflix main card. ""Anderson and his team approached me immediately after the Jake Paul vs.  'Tank' Davis fight was announced and said they would like to be a part  of the event and he would like to fight Chris Weidman,"" Nakisa Bidarian,  Most Valuable Promotions CEO and co-founder, told ESPN . ""Once it was  clear that both men wanted it, and wanted it as a professional fight,  MVP was 100% in, given the history between them, reaching a broader  generational consumer base and enhancing the event's marketability in  Brazil."" Silva and Weidman fought twice in 2013. Weidman, 9-0 as a professional mixed martial artist, knocked out Silva in an all-time UFC shocker. Weidman ended Silva's 16-fight UFC winning streak, a record that holds today. Silva was caught toying with Weidman, fighting with his hands down, casting some doubt over how Weidman would fare in a rematch. Their second fight is perhaps remembered even more vividly, with Silva suffering a horrific leg break after Weidman checked a leg kick. ""I am super excited to embark on another battle against Chris,"" Silva  said in a statement. ""We have a history and on Friday, November 14th,  live only on Netflix, we're putting another stamp on our chapter  together. It will be a spectacle for the fans!"" Silva is 3-2 in boxing. The UFC Hall of Famer returned to boxing in 2021, beating Julio Cesar Chavez Jr. and Tito Ortiz. Most recently, he lost a unanimous decision to Paul in 2022.

a1d162529e96,"‘F1’ Director Joseph Kosinski Looks Back on Shooting Brad Pitt Racing Film: ‘God, That Was Pretty Reckless’",,"Director Joseph Kosinski, actors Brad Pitt, Damson Idris, Sarah Niles and producers Jerry Bruckheimer and Lewis Hamilton joined SAG Foundation national director and BAFTA board member Rochelle Rose for a post-screening panel discussion on “F1: The Movie.” The creatives reflected on the innovative, intense and rewarding process of making the summer blockbuster racing film, with Kosinski admitting, “Looking back, I think, ‘God, that was pretty reckless.'” Kosinski was commenting specifically on the long and turbulent shoot days, many spent at actual F1 racing events with extreme stunts pulled off in-camera. “Normally, when you’re shooting a scene, you have hours or days to shoot it, but because we wanted to shoot this film live at the Grand Prix while the events are going on, we’d often only get a few minutes,” the director recalled. “So, there were times where I would tell Brad and Damson, ‘We’ll be lucky to get three takes at this,’ especially that opening scene at Silverstone. We actually shot three scenes back-to-back in about 15 minutes.” Filming on real F1 racing courses with the actors actually driving the extreme vehicles at up to 180 miles per hour gave the film a profound sense of realism. Pitt and Idris were truly behind the wheel and Hamilton, a professional driver in addition to being a producer on the film, ensured that they knew what they were doing. “Brad Pitt and Damson practiced for four months with Lewis overseeing part of it to make sure that they could drive these cars,” said Bruckheimer. “When you watch this movie and you see Brad and Damson in the car, they’re actually driving these cars. It’s not special effects. It’s the real deal. And they put their life on the line to make this movie as authentic as possible.” Kosinski credits the cast’s commitment and Hamilton’s oversight to the film’s authenticity, but also notes that Apple Studios, the movie’s production company, developed new technology that allowed them to capture the races with unprecedented immersion. “That Apple put their faith in us to actually shoot a movie this way is pretty amazing. Luckily, we pulled it off,” he said. Hamilton added, “What you’re seeing is and incredible evolution of technology with Apple and those new cameras that they designed to capture different angles. The footage we have from the cars are better than what you see when you watch Formula 1. I’m sure at some point, Formula 1 is going to see how we can get those cameras on our cars. But they’re pretty heavy, all the gear.” The film is not just stunts and effects, though. Bruckheimer reiterated that “it’s the energy that they put into the script, because that creates the emotion and that’s what moves you. It’s the hours and days and months that Brad and Lewis and Joe spent time working with our writers to make this as good as it can be.” Pitt, who produced the film as well as starred in it, reflected that the team always aimed to capture the “moments of absolute pure bliss” that come with the high octane sport. “It really stemmed from that,” he said, “This idea of winning is one thing, but the purity of the sport, the feeling, that thing that fulfills you, that you don’t question, you don’t doubt, and you just are. That’s the kind of purity where you are the ultimate of presence.” Warner Brothers released “F1” in theaters on June 27. It grossed over $628 million at the worldwide box office and will be available to stream on Apple TV on Dec. 12.",https://variety.com/2025/film/news/f1-joseph-kosinski-brad-pitt-racing-1236552916,Entertainment,variety.com,Andrew McGowan,https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/F1-2.jpg?w=1000&h=563&crop=1,2025-10-16T17:30:00+00:00,9032e59f90032eb16f2f1b42bdb16018c7a29675
6fc3e2e94f7c,"Dua Lipa on the 56 Cover Versions She’s Played on the ‘Radical Optimism’ Tour, From Green Day to TLC to AC/DC",,"Artists play surprise covers in concert all the time. They record all-covers albums, do special versions for streaming services or B-sides. Kelly Clarkson has covered dozens of songs for her “Kelly-oke” series; Miley Cyrus dropped a bunch online during the pandemic. Sometimes there’s a tribute or theme or personal or geographic connection, sometimes they just like the song. But to our knowledge, no artist has ever gone as high-concept as Dua Lipa on her 2025 “Radical Optimism” tour, which has seen her and her top-notch band covering a different song, always connected to an artist from the city in which they’re performing, every single night of the tour (except one, as you’ll see) — from Australia, where they launched the covers with AC/DC’s “Highway to Hell,” and New Zealand, across Europe and North America, with the Latin American dates starting next month. To date, they’ve performed 56 different covers. In the middle of the set, after they perform “These Walls,” there’s a surprise, and usually an unpredictable one: At her four New York shows, she and the band played songs by Alicia Keys, Blondie, Chic and Lenny Kravitz — iconic yet un-obvious songs paying tribute to the city’s contemporary musical legacy. It’s an enormous challenge, even for professional musicians, because not only do they have to learn to play these songs convincingly — for a hometown audience that might take offense if they mess it up — but as the tour crossed Europe over the summer, Dua herself had to learn songs in languages she doesn’t speak, and not just any songs, but iconic ones that show respect for the host cities and countries. They’ve also been joined on many occasions by the original artists — from Kravitz to Gwen Stefani, from Lionel Richie to Troye Sivan, from Chaka Khan to Czech singer Ewa Farna, from Green Day’s Billie Joe Armstrong to her own father, Dukagjin Lipa, who joined her onstage in his homeland of Kosovo to sing in Albanian. As the North American leg of the tour wraps in Seattle tonight, she and the band will add a 57th cover song to the set (a full list is published below), a daunting task that has put them in a similar league of versatility as the Roots or Tom Petty’s Heartbreakers, where you could find yourself playing a song before thousands, hours after you’d heard it for the first time. Variety caught up with Dua and her bassist and bandleader Matty Carroll over Zoom from San Francisco, at which point they were on the 46th of the 60-odd songs they’ll be learning on the tour. You’ve got a show tonight, shouldn’t you be learning a Grateful Dead or Jefferson Airplane song? Dua : (Laughter) We have already done our soundcheck, I’m excited for tonight’s song. Matty : Yeah, we’ve got a guest coming down as well. [pictured above, Billie Joe Armstrong joined them for Green Day’s “Wake Me Up When September Ends”; the night before it had been “Piece of My Heart,” made famous by Janis Joplin.] We might as well start at the beginning. Whose idea was this, and how did it come about? Dua : This was my idea. It came about purely because I had done a song for the American Country Music Awards with Chris Stapleton, and it was so much fun that I proposed it to the band and to the team: How fun would it be if every night we do a different song? And everyone was like, well that’s quite ambitious. Matty : It started as we were going to do a few over the course of the tour, right? But then we had that initial rehearsal and put three together really quickly, and then we said we could do a different one every night. Dua : Exactly. Who chooses the songs? Dua : It’s definitely a team effort in the end, but before each leg of the tour, I make a little playlist — although when we started doing it, in Australia, it was all of us in the band room, together: “Let’s do [AC/DC’s] ‘Highway to Hell’!,” because it just seemed mad and crazy. So we got up and rehearsed it, and then we said, “Let’s try something else” — we didn’t end up performing it in the end, but I think it was Savage Garden. Then we did “Never Tear Us Apart” by INXS [and more Australian-themed covers], and then we went to New Zealand and did [Lorde’s] “Royals” and [Crowded House’s 1986 hit] “Don’t Dream It’s Over” as well. But then we started getting guests in and we became a little bit spoiled for choice, because people were down to join us. We had Kevin [Parker from Tame Impala], Troye [Sivan], [Crowded House frontman] Neil Finn came down. With Gwen Stefani in Los Angeles Are you learning each one on the day of the show during soundcheck, or is it planned further in advance? Matty : As far in advance as we can. Dua : But some are done on the day — well, not quite on the day. Usually, when we’re in soundcheck we do the song of the night and the next night’s song, even if we have a guest. But sometimes, you know, time is of the essence, and the beauty of it — and the thing that’s so nerve-wracking and insane — is the fact that we do have a very, very limited amount of time to learn all these songs. Matty : And if there’s a last-minute guest … Dua : Yeah, someone comes in and then we’re just like, “Oh, fuck it, we’re changing the song!” Matty : “OK, let’s get back into the band practice room and work it out.” Dua : We’re light on our feet, for sure. It’s not easy to get a song tour-tight that quickly, especially a beloved song by a local artist in a place where you’re not a native. Isn’t that nerve-wracking? Dua : It’s very nerve-wracking! Especially when we we’re doing them in different languages, that’s definitely — my God, my playlist was on loop, all I was doing was looking at the lyrics and listening over and over for intonations and accents and how to try and perfect things in Spanish, French, German, Dutch, Czech! Matty : Czech was the mad one, wasn’t it? Dua : Yeah, that was really hard, because I had no connection, phonetically or sonically, to the language — I’d heard languages like French and German more often, so it was a little bit easier. And then the wildest thing happened in Prague: We picked the Czech song because [keyboardist] Georgie’s dad had lived in Prague and recommended a song by [Czech star] Ewa Farna. We had a little bit of a crazy time with that one because she’s got two versions of the song — one in Czech and one in Polish — and a couple of days before the show I had this awful sinking feeling: “What if we just learned this whole song in Polish?” I was panicking about that, but we triple-checked that we were doing it in Czech. So on the first night, I’m absolutely shaking in my boots, hoping that I’m going to get my pronunciation right, and Ewa Farna was in the crowd! I got offstage and my whole team was like, “You’re never going to guess who’s in the audience.” They brought her to the dressing room and I was like, “Do you just want to come and sing it with me tomorrow?,” because we had two nights, and she was so up for it and was amazing. So that was a really unexpected guest. It also looks like that’s the only song you’ve repeated? Dua : Yes, it was the only one. We did have another song planned for the second night, but honestly, learning that song in Czech was such a big accomplishment for me that getting to do it twice felt very good. For songs in non-English languages, do you have the lyrics written out phonetically in a teleprompter, or are you just practicing all day? Dua : I’m just practicing all day, repeating them over and over and over again. I spend so much time reading lyrics as I’m listening, trying to get it all in my head. And then I just rely on that. Matty : It’s the race of the muscle memory: How many times can you get it into your brain? It must be an enormous challenge for the band for the band as well. Matty, is there one person in particular who takes the lead on getting the covers down, or is it everyone ? Matty : It’s very much a divide-and-conquer. We decide on the song, I’ll work with Dua on the structure, the key, making sure everything is in its right place, and then we’ll start getting parts out to the band. Everyone does their homework. I mean, the band’s fantastic. Dua : Unreal! Honestly, everyone is incredible and so talented. And what I also love about it is that everyone gets a real moment to shine. Sometimes when you make a pop show, there’s not so much room for spontaneity, and this has given us so much space to just be a band. We’ve gotten so tight and rely on each other so much, it’s definitely a bonding experience.  It’s also really funny because “These Walls” is a breakup song, but we’re all smiling because we’re thinking about the next song that’s coming up. Matty : It’s half smiling, half anxiety! Apart from the language challenges, which song was the most difficult to sing? Dua : [Indila’s] “Dernier Danse” in French was really hard because it’s so big, plus in another language, but I loved it. Matty : There’s a few of the songs where you introduce the track, and we all kind of look at each other like, “Best of luck!” Matty, which one was the most difficult for the band to learn, and why? Matty : I think [Gloria Estefan and Miami Sound Machine’s] “Conga.” It’s so fast and intricate, and played in a style that’s so far out from anything we’re playing on the tour. It was a real move into a different genre — a real flex, Georgie nailed the piano part. And it was just over in a flash as well! Dua : That was wild. We turned to each other like, “This is a roast!” Did you intentionally not play Sweden so you wouldn’t have to learn an ABBA song? Their songs are famously difficult to play. Dua : It’s funny because I did think that it would be amazing to sing ABBA, but no — I think the tour dates were set first before we even decided on [playing covers]. With Lionel Richie in Los Angeles Which ones have been the most fun to play? Dua : Oooooh, that’s so hard, because so many of them have been so fun… I think the one with Lenny Kravitz, “It Ain’t Over Til It’s Over.” Matty : I still can’t remember it, Dua : What?? Matty : because it was, like, such an awe[-struck] moment. I think I’m going to get to Christmas — Dua : And then you’re going to be like, “I can’t believe that happened!” Matty : One of my favorites was the first one, “Highway to Hell,” because it was the first time we experienced [the covers concept] together. The guitars came in at the beginning, and a huge cheer went up. Dua : I think people couldn’t quite believe we were playing it. (Laughing) But it was all over the news in Australia for like three days! Everyone sang along, it was so wild. And which one got the most rapturous audience response? Matty : Oh, I know my answer to that one. Dua : Go on. Matty : Amsterdam. Dua : I was going to say the same! ““Bloed, zweet en tranen” a song by this Dutch legend named Andre Hazen. And the whole place just erupted. Sharon, my choreographer’s assistant, she’s Dutch. And so I asked her, because we also were talking about maybe doing Van Halen — because [the Van Halen brothers were born in the Netherlands], we had “Jump” ready as well. But she was like, honestly, Andre Hazen is an Amsterdam legend. And I was like, right, well, I’d better get cracking. We only decided to do that like four days before. Matty : But Sharon said, it’s like their national anthem, everybody knows it. And as soon as we started playing it, it just kicked off. It was amazing. So many of the covers are not obvious, do you ever propose one and then say, “Nah, they’ll be expecting that”? Dua : Honestly, no. I think we just go with songs that we love, and I think they all have some kind of story or personal connection, or evoke a feeling. We’re not picking completely obscure songs, they’re all very well known [to the audiences], for the most part. But maybe they’re not the first songs that people would choose from certain artists. Like, when we thought about a Nelly Furtado song for Toronto, there’s so much amazing legacy there with her and Timbaland’s party songs. But the Nelly that I fell in love with, because it was the first CD I ever bought, was the “Woah Nelly!” album, so “I’m Like a Bird” had to be the song. At the first Madison Square Garden show played Alicia Keys’ “No One” and opened with that video of you singing it at a talent show as an 11-year-old — apart from the Nelly Furtado song, are there others that have that kind of deep personal connection to you? Dua : Even Aerosmith and “I Don’t Wanna Miss a Thing” was very nostalgic for me — I was like, “This is for any kid who was ever armed with LimeWire!” And Kylie Minogue’s “Can’t Get You Out My Head.” I have such a vivid memory of being in like year three [of school] in London, that music video coming out, and it was all I sang. Even “The Chain” by Fleetwood Mac, we chose that because you were playing [the song’s riff on] the bass, and I was like, “We’re doing this?” You’re going to continue on the Latin American tour as well, learning more songs in different languages? Dua : Yes, that is going to be another challenge, all in Spanish and Portuguese. So, watch this space. All right, and here’s the million-dollar question: Are you guys going to make an album out of them? Dua : Um… [funny Greta Garbo accent], I cannot reveal the answer! Anything more you’d like to say? Matty : Well, because we’re still in the process of touring, you kind of do one and “OK, that was great, on to the next one and the next one.” And I think at Christmas when we look back at a year of doing 60-70 covers, and the guests and the experiences that we’ve all shared together on that stage. It’s just been magical, getting to perform with Lenny, with Nile Rodgers, with Chaka Khan, you know? Dua : Legends! Matty : I said to one of Chaka’s team [about “Ain’t Nobody”], “That was one of the first bass lines that I ever learned to play,” and then it’s the full-circle moment kind of coming back around and playing it with everyone onstage with her. There have been so many big emotional moments and core memories formed. Dua, any parting words? Dua : It’s been so much fun, and it’s been so exciting to exercise those muscles and being able to do so many different genres and songs and to collaborate with so many incredible artists and legends. And also, what it’s done for us as a band and how it’s brought us together and made us stronger — it’s almost like we’ve done years of bonding learning these songs so quickly. And I think it’s beautiful for the fans — that kind of nod of  respect of the music and the culture that comes from the city or [area]. I’m sure other people are going to be doing it after this — it is really fun and really rewarding but it is a lot of fucking hard work, so good luck!

a69576a15934,Finn Wolfhard ‘Worried’ About ‘Stranger Things 5’ Because ‘Game of Thrones’ Got ‘Torn to Shreds in That Final Season’: ‘We Hope to Not Have That Happen’,,"Finn Wolfhard revealed in a new interview with Time magazine that he suffered a panic attack during the production of “ Stranger Things 4″ given the show’s intense fandom, which at times has been “subconsciously terrifying” to handle. Wolfhard plays Mike Wheeler on the blockbuster Netflix series, which kicks off its fifth and final season in November. The actor was just 13 years old when “Stranger Things” debuted and catapulted him to international fame. “It’s just a symptom of what filmmaking can be, which is chaotic,” Wolfhard told the publication. “As a child actor, you’re trying to make things easy for people. You don’t know how to speak up for yourself. You don’t know how to ask for a break… It was incredible and subconsciously terrifying to be 13 and all of the sudden everyone knows who you are.” During the filming of “Stranger Things 4,” the pressures of fame collided with post-COVID production protocols, plus Wolfhard “was having normal first-relationship struggles… Halfway through a scene I started hyperventilating. It was kind of like a fishbowl because a lot of the extras are fans. It culminated in sort of a panic attack.” Wolfhard’s co-stars, Caleb McLaughlin and Gaten Matarazzo “pulled him aside and reassured him that they were feeling the same pressure,” Time writes. Whatever pressures existed for Wolfhard and the entire “Stranger Things” cast only intensified as they went into production on “Stranger Things 5.” The show’s series finale is bound to be one of the most scrutinized episodes in TV history. As fans of shows like “Lost” and “Game of Thrones” know, a hugely divisive series finale can risk tainting the entire legacy of a show. “I think everyone was pretty worried, honestly,” Wolfhard told Time magazine . “The way that ‘Game of Thrones’ got torn to shreds in that final season, we’re all walking into this going, ‘We hope to not have that kind of thing happen.’ But then we read the scripts. We knew that it was something special.” “Stranger Things” creator Matt and Ross Duffer told Variety in an exclusive cover story that they’ve had the endgame for the show planned for several years and have always been writing towards it, which will hopefully create a series finale that delivers the goods. “We knew roughly what the end scene was for years — it wasn’t something we had a strain to come up with,” Matt said. “There were elements of it that were discussed for weeks, but the core idea of the ending, we had for a really long time.” “Stranger Things 5” kicks off with Vol. 1 on Nov. 26.",https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/finn-wolfhard-stranger-things-5-backlash-game-of-thrones-1236554587,Entertainment,variety.com,Zack Sharf,https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Finn-Wolfhard-Stranger-Things-Season-4.png?w=1000&h=563&crop=1,2025-10-16T17:10:59+00:00,9fbff07ad9363a15845c30b35b840b3c49c96d2e
