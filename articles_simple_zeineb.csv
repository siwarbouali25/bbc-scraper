6c5c6104a529,‘New Normal’: Is Pakistan trying to set new red lines with Afghan Taliban?,"news, conflict, military, politics, taliban, afghanistan, asia, india, pakistan","Islamabad, Pakistan – When Pakistan’s foreign minister, Ishaq Dar, visited Kabul in April and met his Afghan Taliban counterpart, Amir Khan Muttaqi, analysts viewed the occasion as marking a reset of relations amid the increasing hostilities between the two former allies. Subsequent meetings between the two in May and August , brokered by China , reinforced that sentiment. Recommended Stories list of 4 items end of list But a deadly weekend of clashes along the countries’ porous border has put those diplomatic overtures on hold. Islamabad says it killed more than 200 Taliban fighters; the Taliban government says 58 Pakistani soldiers were killed. The death toll on both sides underscores how fragile the détente earlier in the year was. Pakistan, which has been grappling with a dramatic surge in attacks – especially in the northwestern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, where dozens of military personnel have died – accuses the Taliban of giving sanctuary to armed groups that launch cross-border attacks. The Taliban denies those charges. But on Thursday night, Kabul was rocked by explosions and gunfire. Pakistan neither confirmed nor denied involvement, but the Taliban government said Pakistan had been behind the attacks in Kabul and in an eastern Afghan province, and promised retaliation. Fighting flared again on Saturday night. Pakistan acknowledged that the clashes left at least 23 of its soldiers dead and another 29 injured, and said its forces had taken control of more than 21 posts on Afghan territory. Kabul has not confirmed the Taliban’s casualty figures. That immediate military escalation has passed, but the clashes have evoked parallels with Pakistan’s tense new equation with its eastern neighbour, India, after New Delhi blamed Islamabad for the killing of 26 civilians in Indian-administered Kashmir in April. Like the Taliban’s position on anti-Pakistan armed groups ostensibly operating from Afghan soil, Islamabad, too, rejected any link with the attackers in Indian-administered Kashmir. But just as Islamabad has long accused the Taliban of sheltering groups that attack Pakistan, India has, for decades, alleged that Pakistan supports and sponsors “terrorist” groups that target its territory. Now, some analysts say, Pakistan is trying to establish a “new normal” with the Taliban, by making clear that future attacks on its soil could invite retribution inside Afghanistan. The stance mirrors a position India’s Narendra Modi government took against Pakistan in April, and that Islamabad protested against at the time. India launched strikes inside Pakistani territory in May, resulting in a four-day-long conflict, with both sides using missiles, drones and artillery to attack each other. This shifting landscape between Pakistan and Afghanistan suggests, analysts say, that while the fighting over the weekend might have eased, tensions are likely to simmer in the coming weeks, and a lasting breakthrough remains elusive. Trigger behind the border clashes Out of the various armed groups reportedly operating from Afghanistan, Pakistani authorities regard the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) as the biggest threat. The TTP emerged in 2007 amid the United States-led, so-called “war on terror”, and has for years waged an armed campaign against Islamabad. It seeks to implement strict Islamic law, has demanded the release of imprisoned members, and calls for a reversal of the merger of Pakistan’s former tribal areas with the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province. The TTP is independent of Afghanistan’s Taliban, but the two groups are ideologically aligned. Islamabad blames Kabul for allowing sanctuary for the TTP, as well as other groups such as the Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA) and Islamic State Khorasan Province (ISKP). TTP attacks have increased sharply since the Taliban returned to power in Afghanistan in August 2021, and numbers highlight the increasing trend. “Our data show that the TTP engaged in at least 600 attacks against, or clashes with, security forces in the past year alone. Its activity in 2025 so far already exceeds that seen in all of 2024,” a recent report by the US-based Armed Conflict Location & Event Data (ACLED) project said. In the last few days, several attacks have killed more than two dozen Pakistani soldiers, including officers, with the latest such incident on October 8. Regional powers – including China, Iran and Russia – have repeatedly urged the Taliban to eliminate the TTP and other armed groups operating from Afghanistan. That call was renewed at the Moscow Format consultation in early October, which was also attended by Muttaqi, the Taliban foreign minister. Abdul Basit, a scholar of militancy and a research fellow at Singapore’s S Rajaratnam School of International Studies, said he expects more diplomacy in the coming days, led by countries that have strong ties with both the Taliban and Pakistan, such as Gulf nations or China. “I think it is plausible that Islamabad and Kabul will hold another round of meetings in some third country to re-engage in dialogue, but I believe that tensions will continue to simmer, sometimes going up or sometimes going down. We certainly cannot rule out another round of hostilities at the border,” he told Al Jazeera. Seema Ilahi Baloch, a former Pakistani ambassador who has been involved in informal Pakistan-Afghanistan talks in the past, said that Islamabad had so far failed to persuade the Taliban to prevent Afghanistan from being used as a base for attacks against Pakistan. “Both sides must realise that such conflicts undermine bilateral cooperation and negatively impact regional stability,” she said. “China, which has influence in both Pakistan and Afghanistan, can be the interlocutor to mend fences between the two through diplomacy,” she added. (Al Jazeera) Islamabad’s new normal? Still, analysts say it is becoming increasingly difficult for Pakistan’s officials to ignore the mounting death toll in the country from attacks that Islamabad alleges have originated in Afghanistan. The Centre for Research and Security Studies (CRSS), an Islamabad-based think tank, put the number of deaths of Pakistan’s security personnel at more than 2,400 in the first three quarters of this year, which is on track to become the deadliest year in a decade. Basit said that Islamabad is trying to define a new normal in which any attack believed to have originated in Afghanistan – whether by the TTP or another group – will carry a cost for Kabul. “Any attack which emanates from Afghanistan will be responded [to] with [the] same ferocity on their territory, with Pakistan implying that Afghan Taliban are facilitating such attacks in Pakistan, and thus are legitimate targets,” he said. Basit acknowledged that Pakistan’s new approach appears similar to what New Delhi adopted against Islamabad after the April attack in Indian-administered Kashmir, but said there was a key difference. Regardless of the casualties on both sides of the Afghanistan-Pakistan border during the past weekend’s clashes, the military asymmetry between the two sides is significant, unlike the scenario between India and Pakistan. He pointed to Pakistan’s ability to hit back against India’s attacks in May: Pakistan was able to shoot down several Indian jets in the process. The Taliban, however, though battle-hardened fighters who have a long history of repelling foreign powers, do not have the equipment and training that Pakistan’s professional army does. “There is a difference,” Basit said. Aamer Raza, an assistant professor of political science at the University of Peshawar, said there was a growing feeling within Pakistani policy circles that patience with Afghanistan was wearing thin in the Pakistani establishment. “Although some engagement is inevitable, major breakthroughs shouldn’t immediately be expected. With Pakistan’s clear superiority in air and projectile warfare, even in the last clashes, it could have inflicted greater damage on Afghanistan, but it largely refrained,” he told Al Jazeera. After the weekend clashes, Pakistan’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs, for the first time, also questioned the legitimacy of the Taliban government itself, even though Islamabad was the movement’s chief patron for a quarter of a century. Pakistan demanded “concrete and verifiable actions against these terrorist elements by the Taliban regime” and urged a more inclusive government. “We also hope that one day, the Afghan people would be emancipated, and they would be governed by a true representative government,” the statement read. Baloch, the diplomat, downplayed that language, suggesting that Islamabad was merely calling for elections in Afghanistan. Basit, however, argued that the wording was significant. “This language of the statement also hints that Pakistan might be open to the idea of throwing its support behind anti-Taliban groups if the current regime continues to ignore Pakistan’s legitimate security concerns,” he said. The New Delhi factor The weekend’s clashes also coincided with Muttaqi’s first visit to India . He is, in fact, the first senior Taliban leader to travel to New Delhi since the group took control of Afghanistan four years ago. Muttaqi received a temporary United Nations-sanctions exemption to travel for a week, from October 9 to 16, and met Indian Minister of External Affairs S Jaishankar. Afghanistan’s interim foreign minister, Amir Khan Muttaqi is visiting India from October 9 to 16 for his maiden visit to the country after the Taliban took over the country in August 2021 [Elke Scholiers/Getty Images] Kabul’s moves towards New Delhi also represent the culmination of months of diplomacy that Pakistan has watched closely. From the mid-1990s until a few years ago, India viewed the Taliban as a proxy for Pakistan’s intelligence agencies, and accused the group and its allies of deadly attacks on its diplomatic missions in Afghanistan. But since the group returned to power in Afghanistan, and amid rising Taliban-Pakistan tensions, India has engaged in a series of outreach efforts with Kabul’s new leaders, leading to Muttaqi’s visit. Islamabad continues to allege that New Delhi is fomenting trouble in Pakistan’s Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan provinces, and that some groups are funded or supported by New Delhi from Afghan territory, charges that India has consistently rejected. Now, with tensions on both its western and eastern fronts, Islamabad needs to stay cautious, said Baloch, the former ambassador. “No country can afford to open war fronts on all its borders, and that goes for Pakistan also,” she said. Meanwhile, some analysts have questioned Pakistan’s posture of neither accepting responsibility for last Thursday’s explosions in Afghanistan, nor denying a role. This could damage Pakistan’s credibility if groups based in Afghanistan attack Pakistan again, suggested Fahad Nabeel, who leads the Islamabad-based research consultancy Geopolitical Insights. “The main question will be why Pakistani officials did not claim responsibility for the past alleged strikes [in Afghanistan, in response to attacks in Pakistan]. If Pakistan merely uses the terrorism-threat narrative, critics will ask why it did not take such actions in the past decade,” Nabeel told Al Jazeera. However, Nabeel said that he did not see major parallels between India’s response to the April attack and Pakistan’s recent approach towards the Taliban. “The only commonalities,” he said, lay in both India and Pakistan accusing its neighbours, Pakistan and Afghanistan, of not doing enough to stop UN-sanctioned individuals and groups from using their soil to attack others. Singapore-based Basit said that Pakistan’s air strikes during Muttaqi’s visit were likely intended to send a message: that “Islamabad will not hesitate to use force if it perceives collusion between Kabul and New Delhi to undermine Pakistani security”. However, like Baloch, Basit also acknowledged the limits of that posture. “No country can afford a two-front war,” he said. Basit also said that bigger questions about Islamabad’s approach remained unanswered. “What really is the end game here?” he asked. “Are these strikes going to change the calculus of [the] Afghan Taliban to pushing them into action against the TTP, or will it drive them to forge a closer nexus with [the] TTP?” he asked. “When you use force, you are using it to achieve [a] certain goal, and the question is, what does Pakistan want to achieve with these air strikes?”",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/15/new-normal-is-pakistan-trying-to-set-new-red-lines-with-afghan-taliban,World,BBC,Abid Hussain,https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/epa_68ed534d8480-1760383821.jpg?resize=1920%2C1440,,d30528bcec5a97d5a8c06a723f0db017fbb1eb3f

Published On 15 Oct 2025 15 Oct 2025 Click here to share on social media share2 Share Here is how things stand on Wednesday, October 15, 2025: Fighting Russian forces launched powerful glide bombs and drones against Ukraine’s second-largest city, Kharkiv, in overnight attacks, hitting the city’s main hospital, wounding seven people, and forcing the evacuation of 50 patients, Governor Oleh Syniehubov said. Russia’s Ministry of Defence said that its forces have taken control of the village of Balahan in the Donetsk region in eastern Ukraine. A convoy of United Nations vehicles carrying aid supplies came under fire from Russian forces near the town of Bilozerka in the Kherson region, the UN’s Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) said, describing the attack as “utterly unacceptable”. There were no injuries in the attack on four UN trucks, two of which were set on fire by remote-controlled drones. Local authorities have ordered the evacuation of families from dozens of villages near the all-but-destroyed northeastern Ukrainian city of Kupiansk, citing the “worsening security situation”. Oleh Syniehubov, governor of Ukraine’s northeastern Kharkiv region, said that a total of 409 families with 601 children were told to leave 27 localities. Another official in the affected area later told public broadcaster Suspilne that the list of localities to be evacuated by families had been expanded to 40. Russia will be able to deploy about 2 million military reservists to fight in Ukraine if needed under amendments to a law likely to be backed by the Russian parliament, according to reports. Power outages were reported in the Ukrainian capital and other regions late on Tuesday due to a network overload and the aftermath of Russian attacks, the Kyiv City State Administration said. Power was cut in three central Kyiv districts on the west bank of the Dnipro River running through the city. Ukrenergo, which operates Ukraine’s high-voltage lines, said that lingering problems from Russian attacks on the country’s energy system had triggered outages in regions across northern, central and southeastern Ukraine. Work is to begin this week to restore external power links to the Russian-held Zaporizhzhia nuclear power station, which has been running on emergency diesel generators for three weeks. Mikhail Ulyanov, Russia’s permanent representative to international organisation based in Vienna, told the Russian state news agency RIA that it was “vital to agree on a local ceasefire in areas where the repair work is to be carried out”. Military aid NATO defence ministers will meet on Wednesday to try to drum up more military support for Ukraine amid a sharp drop in deliveries of weapons and ammunition to the war-ravaged country in recent months. European military aid to Ukraine declined sharply this summer, despite a recent NATO initiative in which member countries bought US weapons and transferred them to Kyiv, the Kiel Institute for the World Economy said. The United Kingdom has delivered more than 85,000 military drones to Ukraine over the last six months, Secretary of State for Defence John Healey has said, according to the Press Association. German Federal Minister of Finance Lars Klingbeil said his country would continue to “financially secure Ukraine’s defence capabilities for the next few years”, while also working with the US to “massively increase pressure on [Russian President Vladimir] Putin to end his brutal war of aggression”. Politics and diplomacy Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has stripped the mayor of the port city of Odesa, Gennadiy Trukhanov, of his Ukrainian citizenship after it was discovered he held Russian citizenship. Trukhanov could now face deportation. Trukhanov denied the claim, saying, “I am a citizen of Ukraine”, and said he would challenge the decision in Ukraine’s Supreme Court and, if necessary, the European Court of Human Rights. Zelenskyy said he would appoint a military administration to govern Odesa, citing unresolved security concerns. Ukraine prohibits dual citizenship with Russia, and Trukhanov has long faced allegations of holding both. A Kyiv government source told the AFP news agency that Ukrainian ballet dancer Sergei Polunin had also been stripped of citizenship. Polunin has been a vocal supporter of the Russian president. Pro-Kremlin politician Oleg Tsaryov, who survived an assassination attempt in 2023, was also among those who had their Ukrainian citizenship revoked, according to AFP. United States President Donald Trump said he was “very disappointed” with Russian leader Putin in advance of a planned visit by Zelenskyy to Washington, DC, later this week. “I don’t know why he continues with this war,” Trump said of Putin. Zelenskyy is set to meet Trump in Washington, DC, on Friday, where the two will discuss Ukraine’s air defence and long-range strike capabilities. Ukrainian Prime Minister Yulia Svyrydenko said she was focusing on Russian attacks on her country’s energy grid in talks this week with US officials. Svyrydenko described the priorities of her visit to Washington, DC, as “energy, sanctions and the development of cooperation with the USA in new ways that can strengthen both our countries”. Russia’s Federal Security Service (FSB) said it had opened a criminal case against exiled Russian businessman Mikhail Khodorkovsky and other prominent Kremlin critics, accusing them of plotting to violently seize power. The FSB said it was investigating all 22 members of the Russian Antiwar Committee – a group of Russian politicians, businesspeople, journalists, lawyers, artists and academics all based outside the country, who oppose Russia’s war on Ukraine. Regional security Polish Minister of Foreign Affairs Radoslaw Sikorski warned that Europe must be prepared for Russia to strike deep into the region, calling it “irresponsible” not to build defences such as a “drone wall” on its eastern flank. German Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul has accused China of undermining the international rules-based order through its increasingly aggressive policies in Asia and its support for Russia. Wadephul also criticised Russia, saying Moscow is testing NATO’s resolve, violating European Union and NATO airspace, spying on Germany’s critical infrastructure and seeking to influence public discourse with propaganda and disinformation. Trump threatened trade penalties, including tariffs, against Spain, saying he was unhappy with its refusal to raise defence spending to 5 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) and calling the move disrespectful to NATO. Pro-Russian hackers brought down the German government’s public procurement portal, the Sddeutsche Zeitung (SZ) newspaper reported on Tuesday. The cyberattack rendered this important interface between the state and businesses inaccessible for almost a week, the report said. Sweden will set up its first emergency grain stocks in the north of the country, a region that risks being isolated in a conflict, the government said. In its 2026 budget, Stockholm plans to invest 575 million kronor ($60m) to set up the grain reserves. Sweden revived its “total defence” strategy in 2015 following Russia’s annexation of Crimea, and more measures were introduced after Moscow’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022. Trade Russia’s war in Ukraine is bad for US businesses, which have heavily invested in Europe and whose profits are affected by the uncertainty that Moscow’s aggression creates, European Economic Commissioner Valdis Dombrovskis said. Dombrovskis said that in 2023, US-owned assets in Europe were worth an estimated $19.2 trillion, or roughly 64 percent of all US corporate foreign assets globally.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/15/russia-ukraine-war-list-of-key-events-day-1329,World,BBC,Kevin Doyle,https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2025-10-14T102448Z_1566502081_RC2KBHAQ15EG_RTRMADP_3_UKRAINE-CRISIS-KOSTIANTYNIVKA-1760489698.jpg?resize=1920%2C1440,,d7fa96dc4f0a5888326fb8291fd415eb6f006ad5

The hosts of the 2022 edition of the global showpiece event reached the finals for the first time through the qualification route, when they beat the United Arab Emirates on Tuesday. Recommended Stories list of 4 items end of list South Africa also clinched a tight group , with fellow African giants Nigeria pushed to the playoffs, on a tense final day of group stage qualifiers on the continent. This came a day after Cape Verde’s first qualification for the World Cup finals. The European teams still have some way to go to finish their qualifying groups, but the picture has become far clearer with some progress already made. Al Jazeera Sport takes a close look at how the qualifying process stands around the globe: Which teams are in the FIFA World Cup 2026? After the latest round of qualifying matches, here is a breakdown of the confirmed contenders from each of the six regions: Hosts: Canada, Mexico, United States Asia: Australia, Iran, Japan, Jordan, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, South Korea, Uzbekistan Africa: Algeria, Cape Verde, Egypt, Ghana, Ivory Coast, Morocco, Senegal, South Africa, Tunisia Europe: England Oceania: New Zealand South America: Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, Paraguay, Uruguay Who can still qualify for the FIFA World Cup 2026? Africa: Cameroon, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Gabon and Nigeria will play off for the final intercontinental spot from the continent. The Confederation of African Football (CAF) has yet to announce the dates for those matches. Asia: The UAE and Iraq will vie for one intercontinental playoffs spot when they compete over two legs in the final stage of the Asian Football Confederation (AFC) qualifiers in November. Europe: 53 of the 54 European teams vying for 16 qualification spots can still confirm their berths, alongside England, as their first-round matches will run until November 18. North, Central America and the Caribbean: With the World Cup host nations taking three spots, only three are left up for grabs. They will be decided on November 18. Bermuda, Costa Rica, Curacao, El Salvador, Honduras, Guatemala, Haiti, Jamaica, Nicaragua, Panama, Suriname, and Trinidad and Tobago have all advanced to the third round. The three second-placed teams from each group will then fight for the intercontinental playoffs spot. Oceania: New Caledonia have qualified for the intercontinental playoffs. South America: Bolivia have qualified for the intercontinental playoffs, having missed out on one of the six automatic qualifying positions. Which major teams have been eliminated from qualification? Peru and Chile, who were third-place finishers in 1962, were the biggest names to miss out from the South America qualifiers, where Venezuela were also eliminated. Although not considered a powerhouse in Asia, China will be disappointed not to reach their first finals since 2002. Angola, Libya, Mali and Namibia will be among those disappointed to be eliminated from the African qualification. Indonesia were hoping to reach only a second World Cup, and made a valiant run to the fourth round of AFC qualification. But they will be disappointed not to have gone one step further following their Dutch recruitment drive, which included their coach, Patrick Kluivert. Bahrain, who topped their 2023 AFC Asian Cup group stage ahead of South Korea, only to be eliminated by Japan in the round of 16, will be deflated to have missed out on the chance to showcase their skills on the global stage. Palestine were only seconds away from reaching the fourth round of the AFC qualifier and, following their historic run to the knockout stage of the last Asian Cup, will also be disappointed not to have at least gone one step further in their continental qualifiers. When will all the teams for the FIFA World Cup 2026 be confirmed? European qualification rounds stretch beyond the current group stages to March, while the intercontinental playoff final is scheduled for the same month, so the final 48 teams for the World Cup will not be known until less than three months before the tournament. March 31, 2026, is when all qualification will come to an end. When and where is the draw for the FIFA World Cup 2026? The World Cup draw, as revealed by US President Donald Trump in August, will take place on December 5 at the Kennedy Center in Washington, DC. “It’s the biggest, probably the biggest event in sports, I guess,” said Trump, who made the announcement in an Oval Office event where he was joined by Vice President JD Vance and FIFA President Gianni Infantino. Trump also did not rule out overseeing the draw himself. When is the FIFA World Cup 2026 scheduled?

36a58ddeda36,"US, China roll out port fees, threatening more trade turmoil","economy, news, business and economy, financial markets, international trade, politics, shipping, trade war, asia pacific, china, united states, us & canada","The United States and China have started charging additional port fees on ocean shipping firms that move everything from holiday toys to crude oil, making the high seas a key front in the trade war between the world’s two largest economies. A return to an all-out trade war appeared imminent last week, after China announced a major expansion of its rare earths export controls, and US President Donald Trump threatened to raise tariffs on Chinese goods to triple digits. Recommended Stories list of 3 items end of list But after the weekend, both sides sought to reassure traders and investors, highlighting cooperation between their negotiating teams and the possibility they could find a way forward. China said it had started to collect the special charges on US-owned, operated, built or flagged vessels, but it clarified that Chinese-built ships would be exempted from the levies. In details published by state broadcaster CCTV, China spelled out specific provisions on exemptions, which also include empty ships entering Chinese shipyards for repair. Similar to the US plan, the new China-imposed fees would be collected at the first port of entry on a single voyage or for the first five voyages within a year. “This tit-for-tat symmetry locks both economies into a spiral of maritime taxation that risks distorting global freight flows,” Athens-based Xclusiv Shipbrokers said in a research note. Early this year, the Trump administration announced plans to levy the fees on China-linked ships to loosen the country’s grip on the global maritime industry and bolster US shipbuilding. An investigation during the administration of former US President Joe Biden concluded that China uses unfair policies and practices to dominate the global maritime, logistics and shipbuilding sectors, clearing the way for those penalties. China hit back last week, saying it would impose its own port fees on US-linked vessels from the same day the US fees took effect. “We are in the hectic stage of the disruption, where everyone is quietly trying to improvise workarounds, with varying degrees of success,” said independent dry bulk shipping analyst Ed Finley-Richardson. He said he has heard reports of US shipowners with non-Chinese vessels trying to sell their cargoes to other countries while en route, so the vessels can divert. The Reuters news agency was not immediately able to confirm this. Tit-for-tat moves Analysts expect China-owned container carrier COSCO to be the most affected by the US fees, shouldering nearly half of that segment’s expected $3.2bn cost from the fees in 2026. Major container lines, including Maersk, Hapag-Lloyd and CMA CGM, slashed their exposure by switching China-linked ships out of their US shipping lanes. Trade officials there reduced fees from initially proposed levels, and exempted a broad swath of vessels after heavy pushback from the agriculture, energy and US shipping industries. The Office of the US Trade Representative (USTR) did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Reuters. China’s Ministry of Commerce on Tuesday said, “If the US chooses confrontation, China will see it through to the end; if it chooses dialogue, China’s door remains open.” In a related move, Beijing also imposed sanctions on Tuesday against five US-linked subsidiaries of South Korean shipbuilder Hanwha Ocean, which it said had “assisted and supported” a US probe into Chinese trade practices. Hanwha, one of the world’s largest shipbuilders, owns Philly Shipyard in the US and has won contracts to repair and overhaul US Navy ships. Its entities will also build a US-flagged LNG carrier. Hanwha said it is aware of the announcement and is closely monitoring the potential business impact. Hanwha Ocean’s shares sank by nearly 6 percent. China also launched an investigation into how the US probe affected its shipping and shipbuilding industries. A Shanghai-based trade consultant said the new fees may not cause significant upheaval. “What are we going to do? Stop shipping? Trade is already pretty disrupted with the US, but companies are finding a way,” the consultant told Reuters, requesting anonymity because he was not authorised to speak with the media. The US announced last Friday a carve-out for long-term charterers of China-operated vessels carrying US ethane and liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), deferring the port fees for them through December 10. Meanwhile, ship-tracking company Vortexa identified 45 LPG-carrying VLGCs — an acronym for very large gas carriers, a type of vessel — that would be subject to China’s port fee. That amounts to 11 percent of the total fleet. Clarksons Research said in a report that China’s new port fees could affect oil tankers accounting for 15 percent of global capacity. Meanwhile, Omar Nokta, an analyst at the financial firm Jefferies, estimated that 13 percent of crude tankers and 11 percent of container ships in the global fleet would be affected. Trade war embroils environmental policy In a reprisal against China curbing exports of critical minerals, Trump on Friday threatened to slap additional 100 percent tariffs on goods from China and put new export controls on “any and all critical software” by November 1. Administration officials, hours later, warned that countries voting this week in favour of a plan by the United Nations International Maritime Organization (IMO) to reduce planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions from ocean shipping could face sanctions, port bans, or punitive vessel charges. China has publicly supported the IMO plan. “The weaponisation of both trade and environmental policy signals that shipping has moved from being a neutral conduit of global commerce to a direct instrument of statecraft,” Athens-based Xclusiv said.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/14/us-china-roll-out-port-fees-threatening-more-trade-turmoil,World,BBC,,https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2025-10-13T070031Z_280837114_RC2Q0GA463B4_RTRMADP_3_CHINA-ECONOMY-TRADE-1760483357.jpg?resize=1920%2C1440,,a6d76f5145d69567cf1177ac750314bb81ab9782
77ac7d6515a1,South Africa says ICJ genocide case will continue despite Gaza ceasefire,"news, genocide, africa, israel, middle east, palestine, south africa","South African President Cyril Ramaphosa says the Gaza ceasefire will not affect his country’s genocide case against Israel at the International Court of Justice (ICJ). Ramaphosa made the statement on Tuesday in Cape Town in parliament, stressing that South Africa’s determination to pursue its 2023 case despite the agreement on the widely lauded US-backed deal aimed at ending Israel’s war on the besieged territory. “The peace deal that has been struck, which we welcome, will have no bearing on the case that is before the International Court of Justice,” Ramaphosa told parliament. “The case is proceeding, and it now has to go to the stage where Israel has to respond to our pleadings that have been filed in the court, and they have to do so by January of next year,” he added. South Africa filed the case in December 2023, accusing Israel of genocidal acts in Gaza. South Africa handed in a 500-page detailed submission in October 2024, with Israel’s counter-arguments due by January 12, 2026. Oral hearings are anticipated in 2027, with a final judgement expected in late 2027 or early 2028. The ICJ has issued three provisional measures, ordering Israel to prevent genocidal acts and allow humanitarian aid into Gaza, though Israel has largely failed to comply. More than 67,000 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza since October 2023, according to Palestinian health authorities. Ramaphosa emphasised that real healing requires the case being properly heard. “We cannot go forward without the healing that needs to take place, which will also result from the case that has been launched being properly heard,” he said. Responding to a news report about the announcement, Francesca Albanese, the United Nations special rapporteur on the occupied Palestinian territory, wrote on X: “Peace without justice, respect for human rights and dignity, without reparations and guarantees of non reeptition [sic], is not sustainable.” Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez, who has been a vocal critic of Israel, echoed similar sentiments, telling Spanish radio that the ceasefire should not mean impunity for Israel. “There cannot be impunity”, Sanchez said, adding that “the main actors of the genocide will have to answer to justice”. Several rights groups, including Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch, have accused Israel of committing genocidal acts in Gaza. A UN commission of inquiry found in September 2025 that Israel had committed genocide. Israel has strongly rejected allegations that it has carried out a genocide in Gaza. Several countries have joined , or declared an intention to do so, in the ICJ case to support South Africa, including Spain, Ireland, Turkiye and Colombia, whose president, Gustavo Petro, wrote that governments risk becoming “complicit in the atrocities” if they fail to act.

Published On 14 Oct 2025 14 Oct 2025 Click here to share on social media share2 Share Syrian President Ahmed al-Sharaa will visit Russia on Wednesday to meet with President Vladimir Putin, Syria’s state news agency reports, as part of a broader diplomatic push to bolster the Damascus transitional government’s international legitimacy. It will be al-Sharaa’s first official visit to Moscow, a longtime ally of the former Bashar al-Assad regime that al-Sharaa’s forces ousted in December. Recommended Stories list of 3 items end of list During the visit, al-Sharaa and Putin will discuss “regional and international developments” and “ways to strengthen cooperation”, Syria’s SANA news agency reported on Tuesday, citing the presidential media directorate. Al-Sharaa will also meet with members of the Syrian community living in Russia, the report said. The Reuters news agency cited a Syrian official as saying that al-Sharaa will hold talks on the continued presence of Russia’s naval base in Tartous and its air base in Khmeimim. The source added that al-Sharaa also plans to formally request that Moscow hand over al-Assad, who has been living in exile with his family in Moscow since fleeing Syria in December. Al-Sharaa, who once headed the Syrian branch of al-Qaeda under the name Abu Mohammed al-Julani, commanded rebel forces that seized Damascus and installed a new government late last year, ending al-Assad’s decades-long rule. Since then, Russia has sought to build ties with Syria’s new leadership, including offering Damascus diplomatic support over Israeli strikes on Syrian territory. SANA reported that Putin called al-Sharaa in February, expressing support for Syria’s “unity, sovereignty and stability”. In July, Putin and his minister of foreign affairs, Sergey Lavrov, met with Syrian Foreign Minister Asaad al-Shibani in Moscow. The Syrian president’s visit to Moscow follows his September trip to New York, where he addressed the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA), declaring that Syria was “reclaiming its rightful place among the nations of the world” and urging for an end to sanctions.

383c45b71a97,‘Not going to waste our time’: Trump hinges US aid to Argentina on election,"economy, news, business and economy, donald trump, government, politics, argentina, latin america, united states, us & canada","United States President Donald Trump has pledged to boost Argentina’s economy with a $20bn currency swap — but only if the South American country’s right-wing president prevails in the upcoming elections. That president, the self-described anarcho-capitalist Javier Milei, was in Washington, DC, on Tuesday for his latest visit to the White House. Recommended Stories list of 3 items end of list “We think he’s going to win. He should win. And if he does win, we’re going to be very helpful,” Trump said. “And if he doesn’t win, we’re not going to waste our time, because you have somebody whose philosophy has no chance of making Argentina great again.” Since taking office in December 2023, Milei has made at least a dozen trips to the US, including to attend Trump’s second inauguration. The two leaders share a strong public bond. But Milei’s latest meeting with Trump comes as his political coalition, La Libertad Avanza (Freedom Advances), faces a series of hurdles heading into Argentina’s midterm elections on October 26. Trump appeared eager to help Milei overcome his drooping poll numbers on Tuesday, as he hosted the Argentinian leader in the White House’s cabinet room. He explained to reporters that the economic safety net that the US was giving to Argentina was his way of “helping a great philosophy take over a great country”. “ You’re going to win the election,” Trump told Milei. “We’re going to endorse you. I’m going to endorse you today, fully endorse you. People in Argentina like me. A lot of people like me.” Trump proceeded to post about Milei on his social media platform Truth Social, pledging to “support his work during the upcoming Midterms”. Argentina’s Javier Milei reads from a letter he presented to Donald Trump during a meeting in the Cabinet Room of the White House [Alex Brandon/AP Photo] A conditional bailout The conditional nature of the Argentinian bailout, however, has raised questions about Trump’s commitment to propping up Argentina’s ailing economy. Milei’s surprise victory in the 2023 presidential election was widely seen as a backlash against the previous left-wing government of Alberto Fernandez, under whose leadership inflation spiralled to more than 200 percent. However, while Milei has reduced inflation, the value of the Argentinian peso remains low, and critics have accused the South American president of slashing programmes for low-income residents, exacerbating poverty. One reporter on Tuesday asked Trump outright if the US’s support for Argentina depended on a win for La Libertad Avanza in the upcoming elections. “ Well, I think if they don’t do that, we’re not going to be around very long,” Trump replied. The US president then mused about a potential loss for Milei’s party. “We would not be generous with Argentina if that happened. If he loses, we are not going to be generous with Argentina.” Trump also alluded to the potential for further economic turmoil should Milei’s “extremely far-left” rival prevail, though it was unclear which opposition figure he was referring to. Milei himself is not on the ballot on October 26, but his party, La Libertad Avanza, will be competing for half the seats in Argentina’s Chamber of Deputies and a third in its Senate. Control of Argentina’s National Congress will determine whether Milei can continue to carry out his wide-reaching austerity measures, among them a push to overhaul the federal government. Milei himself has illustrated the dramatic nature of his cost-cutting campaign by turning to props. He was known for wielding a chainsaw on stage during his presidential bid and whacking piñatas emblazoned with the name of Argentina’s Central Bank. Argentina’s President Javier Milei attends a ceremony to present the Presidential Medal of Freedom to Charlie Kirk’s widow Erika Kirk [Mark Schiefelbein/AP Photo] Backlash to Milei But while Milei’s victory in the 2023 presidential race was a strong rebuke to Argentina’s left wing, more recent races have shown public support for his agenda cooling. On September 7, the province of Buenos Aires held elections for its congressional seats, and La Libertad Avanza was trounced by a rival coalition, the left-wing Justicialist Party. That party took more than 46 percent of the vote, compared with La Libertad Avanza’s 34 percent. Also that month, Milei suffered a personal scandal when his sister and close associate, Karina Milei, was implicated in a case of alleged bribery. Karina Milei serves as secretary-general to the presidency, and leaked audio appears to show the then-head of the National Disability Agency accusing her of accepting kickbacks in exchange for government contracts. Both of the Milei siblings have denied the charges, and so far, Javier has stood by his sister. The resulting scandal, however, has cast a stark spotlight on Milei’s actions as president. Milei had vetoed congressional legislation that would have increased benefits for people with disabilities, but in September, Argentina’s Congress pushed back, forming an overwhelming supermajority to overturn his veto, by a vote of 63 to seven. It has since repeated the feat, overriding Milei’s vetoes to restore congressional funding for universities and paediatric healthcare. Still, despite the setbacks, Trump and his officials used Tuesday’s meeting as a platform to promote Milei’s agenda and project confidence in his party’s midterm prospects. “We think he’s going to do quite well and then continue his reform agenda,” Secretary of the Treasury Scott Bessent told reporters. President Donald Trump holds up a framed letter from Argentina’s President Javier Milei [Alex Brandon/AP Photo] Projecting confidence Like Trump, Bessent underscored that the $20bn promised to Argentina was hinged on Milei’s electoral successes. A return to the left-wing Peronist policies of the previous administration, with its emphasis on social justice, would not be tolerated, he added. “We’re confident that the president’s party will — and the coalition will — do well in the election, and this aid is predicated on robust policies,” Bessent said. “Going back to the failed Peronist policies would cause a US rethink.” Trump, meanwhile, acknowledged that Argentinian voters may be experiencing “some pain” as a result of Milei’s economic reform. But he defended Milei, arguing that “Argentina would be lost if he wasn’t there”. When asked what his advice would be to the South American leader, Trump used the question to blame the news media for presenting Milei in a bad light. “My advice is to hold strong to his principles, because he’s right, and he’s proving that he is right. He’s got one problem. He’s got people that are giving him tremendously bad press,” Trump said. “Everybody knows he’s doing the right thing. But you have a radical-left sick culture that’s a very dangerous group of people, and they’re trying to make him look bad.” The remarks were a reflection of Trump’s own adversarial relationship with the press. During his appearance with Milei, Trump once again took the opportunity to slam US outlets like ABC News, labelling the channel “fake news”. Trump, who campaigned on an “America First” platform, has himself faced public scrutiny over his outreach to Argentina. US Representative Maxine Waters, for instance, has accused Trump of putting his political allies over the welfare of the American people. The US government, she pointed out, remains in a state of shutdown. “Instead of re-opening the government, Trump is prioritizing a foreign financial bailout, in part, to prop up an ideological ally in a coming election,” Waters wrote in a statement . The $20bn currency swap — wherein US dollars will be sent to Argentina in exchange for pesos, to help boost their value — comes after Bessent said he would take “exceptional measures” to stabilise the South American country. That includes withdrawing from the Exchange Stabilization Fund, an emergency fund that falls under the Treasury’s authority. On Tuesday, Trump even joked that he was willing to send missiles to Argentina to help Milei combat his opposition. “Do you need any Tomahawks in Argentina?” Trump quipped, to polite chuckles. “You need them for your opposition, I guess.”",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/14/not-going-to-waste-our-time-trump-hinges-us-aid-to-argentina-on-election,World,BBC,Allison Griner,https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/AP25287640170201-1760465165.jpg?resize=1920%2C1440,,da51c76e93b9e2181c141b1c8e6cd2e783cbcd7a
8fd9d8c17f31,"Israel imposes new Gaza aid restrictions, keeps Rafah crossing closed","news, gaza, humanitarian crises, israel-palestine conflict","Israel has imposed new restrictions on aid entering the besieged Gaza Strip and will not open the Rafah crossing as planned, while Israeli forces killed at least nine people in the Palestinian territory as the Israel-Hamas ceasefire came under growing strain. Israel notified the United Nations on Tuesday that it will only allow 300 aid trucks – half of the number it originally agreed to – daily into the Gaza Strip from Wednesday. Recommended Stories list of 4 items end of list Olga Cherevko, a spokesperson for the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) in Gaza, confirmed the UN had received the note from the Coordination of Government Activities in the Territories (COGAT), the arm of the Israeli military that oversees aid flows into Gaza. The COGAT note said no fuel or gas will be allowed into the war-torn enclave except for specific needs related to humanitarian infrastructure. Reporting from Gaza City, Al Jazeera’s Hani Mahmoud noted that allowing 300 trucks of aid each day was “not nearly enough” for famine-stricken Gaza. “Three hundred is not enough. It’s not going to change anything,” he said. Israeli authorities also announced the Rafah border crossing between Gaza and Egypt will remain closed. The restrictions came hours after Israeli forces killed at least nine Palestinians in attacks in northern and southern Gaza, medical sources told Al Jazeera. At least six Palestinians were killed by Israeli forces in Gaza City, and three others were killed in Khan Younis. Sources from al-Ahli Arab Hospital told Al Jazeera Arabic on Tuesday that Israeli soldiers killed five Palestinians in the Shujayea neighbourhood of Gaza City. The Israeli military said it opened fire to remove a threat posed by people who approached its forces in northern Gaza. The attacks come four days after a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas took effect, preparing the way for an exchange of captives and partial Israeli withdrawal from Gaza. The ceasefire is the first phase of US President Donald Trump’s proposal for ending Israel’s war on Gaza , which has killed at least 67,913 people and wounded 170,134 since October 2023, according to Palestinian health authorities. The remains of thousands of other people are estimated to be under the rubble in Gaza. At least 1,139 people were killed in Israel during the Hamas-led attack on October 7, 2023, and more than 200 others were taken captive. (Al Jazeera) Under the terms of the ceasefire, Hamas and Israel carried out an exchange on Monday that saw the release of nearly 2,000 Palestinians imprisoned in Israeli jails and 20 Israeli captives held in the Gaza Strip. Some 154 prisoners were exiled to Egypt. Hamas was also due to return the remains of 28 dead captives on Monday, but the group only handed over four coffins initially. Hamas said that it would transfer the remains of four more deceased Israeli captives on Tuesday, and the Israeli military said that the Red Cross had received those bodies. The military later said the bodies had arrived in Israel, where they would undergo forensic tests. The Israeli military earlier accused Hamas of violating the ceasefire “regarding the release of the bodies of the hostages”. Trump noted the delay in handing over the remains of all deceased captives in a post on his Truth Social platform. “THE DEAD HAVE NOT BEEN RETURNED, AS PROMISED! Phase Two begins right NOW!!!” he wrote. Hamas has previously said recovering the bodies of some captives could take more time because not all sites where they were held are known, and because of the vast Israeli destruction of the enclave. “The headline here is, Israel is already starting to put threats of restricting aid going into Gaza for what they say is the slow work by Hamas to get the bodies of the deceased captives back to Israel,” Al Jazeera’s Gabriel Elizondo said, reporting from the UN’s headquarters in New York. UN urges more aid deliveries The UN and the International Red Cross called for all crossings into Gaza to be opened to allow desperately needed aid into the enclave. The UN had 190,000 metric tonnes of aid waiting and ready to go into Gaza, OCHA spokesman Jens Laerke said on Tuesday. UNICEF spokesman Ricardo Pires, meanwhile, said the UN Children’s Fund (UNICEF) had 1,370 trucks ready to enter Gaza. “The level of destruction, again, is so huge that it will take at least 600 trucks a day, which is the aim that we have,” he said. “We’re far from that.” The World Health Organization (WHO) also stressed the need to send more aid into Gaza. “We need to scale up the delivery of medical supplies because the pressure on hospitals is not going to ease overnight,” WHO spokesman Tarik Jasarevic told reporters. “We need really to bring as many supplies as we can right now to make sure that those health workers who are still providing healthcare have what they need.”",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/14/israel-imposes-new-gaza-aid-restrictions-keeps-rafah-crossing-closed,World,BBC,Abby Rogers,https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2025-10-14T133052Z_1740157120_RC2NBHAZZDYF_RTRMADP_3_ISRAEL-PALESTINIANS-GAZA-1760466636.jpg?resize=1920%2C1440,,6cf1a14f773b54cb0bf914c262996af815a787cf
9e6d5c2fbe41,"Trump administration carries out lethal strike in Caribbean, killing six","news, conflict, donald trump, drugs, government, military, nicolas maduro, politics, united states, us & canada","President Donald Trump announced that the United States has carried out another air strike on a vessel off the Venezuelan coast, once again accusing the boat of transporting drugs. In a social media post on Tuesday, Trump said six people were killed in the latest bombing. Recommended Stories list of 3 items end of list “Under my Standing Authorities as Commander-in-Chief, this morning, the Secretary of War, ordered a lethal kinetic strike on a vessel affiliated with a Designated Terrorist Organization (DTO),” Trump wrote. “The strike was conducted in International Waters, and six male narcoterrorists aboard the vessel were killed in the strike. No U.S. Forces were harmed.” Trump did not offer any evidence to confirm his allegation that the boat was “conducting narcotrafficking”. But as with past strikes, he shared an unclassified video of the bombing, which appeared to show a small boat seemingly drifting in the water, not moving, before the US missile makes impact. This latest attack is believed to be the fifth such US bombing in the Caribbean Sea. Experts and rights groups have described the US strikes as a clear violation of international law since drug traffickers do not qualify as armed combatants. Despite their dubious legality, the strikes have become commonplace over the last month and a half. The first such attack took place on September 2, killing 11 people. Two further attacks took place on September 15 and 19, with three people killed in each case. Then, a fourth strike came on October 3, with US Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth claiming four fatalities aboard that boat. Tuesday’s attack brings the known death toll to 27. Targeting cartels with executive power In each case, Trump and his officials have claimed that the air strikes were necessary to prevent “narco-terrorists” from reaching the US with their deadly cargo, though it is unclear who was onboard those small vessels, what they were carrying, and what their destination was. Suspected drug trafficking vessels are often interdicted by US forces at sea as part of the government’s efforts to halt the transportation of drugs into the country. But critics say the lethal attacks reflect Trump’s push for executive power with few limits, both at home and abroad. Still, Trump has attempted to lay the groundwork for international action against drug cartels, through a series of executive actions and statements. In early October, for instance, the Trump administration issued a memo to Congress saying the president had determined that the US was enmeshed in a “non-international armed conflict” with the cartels, whom he described as “unlawful combatants”. And in August, news reports emerged that Trump had secretly signed a separate order authorising military strikes against drug-trafficking networks. That continues a months-long campaign by the Trump administration to recategorise drug trafficking as an act of foreign hostility. Since February, the Trump administration has sought to label a wide variety of criminal and narcotics groups as “foreign terrorist organizations” (FTOs), a move rights groups say could pave the way for US military operations abroad. Last week, the US Senate voted down a bill introduced by a handful of Democratic senators that would have required the approval of the legislative branch for any future strikes on drug-trafficking vessels. US military build-up in Caribbean The attacks have also taken place amid a build-up of US forces in the Caribbean, including at bases in Puerto Rico. The increase in fighter jets and other military equipment in the region has prompted questions about possible attacks on Venezuela. Trump has long had an adversarial relationship with Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro, and on Tuesday, he repeated past accusations that Venezuela was responsible for an “invasion” of foreign gangs into the US. “We get drugs and all of that, but we get something, in a way, worse,” Trump said at a news conference in the White House, repeating unsubstantiated allegations. “What they do very well is they send their criminals into the United States, and they send trend Tren de Aragua.” A US intelligence report declassified in May found no evidence that Maduro has directed the Tren de Aragua gang or its movements in the US.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/14/trump-administration-carries-out-lethal-strike-in-caribbean-killing-six,World,BBC,,https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/AP25287682861481-1760473075.jpg?resize=1920%2C1440,,0ffce195a375c5c5e46b8eaa586347b84e9fb710

Tunisia’s state-run TAP news agency reported that children experiencing breathing difficulties from the fumes were admitted to Gabes University Hospital on Tuesday. Recommended Stories list of 3 items end of list A local official cited by AFP news agency said more than 120 people had been hospitalised in the city, while an education official cited by the Diwan FM radio channel said dozens of students were admitted to hospital. On top of respiratory problems, some patients suffered from “leg pain, numbness, and loss of mobility”, said local defence deputy chief Ghofrane Touati. Resident Tawfik Dhaifallah said his little sister was “suffocating because of the fumes” emanating from the city’s industrial zone. “That happens every two or three days.” The latest hospitalisations are part of spike in reported cases of respiratory problems that residents blame on fumes from the Tunisian Chemical Group’s (CGT) phosphate headquarters – a site authorities pledged to gradually close in 2017 but have yet to follow through on. Protests Years of frustration over the site’s emissions erupted on October 11, when residents stormed the complex demanding its closure. “Gabes has turned into a city of death, people are struggling to breathe, many residents suffer from cancer or bone fragility due to the severe pollution,” Khaireddine Dbaya, one of the protesters, told the Reuters news agency. The protest turned violent as police fired tear gas and chased demonstrators through the city streets, Reuters reported. Some protesters tried to set fire to a branch office of the CGT’s administration, while others blocked roads in the city, according to local media. The Gabes local council on Sunday said it supported the “legitimate” demands of the protesters and called for the “dismantling of polluting chemical plants”, while also criticising “acts of vandalism and violence”. The Tunisian League of Human Rights also backed the protesters and called for “the dismantling of polluting units and the establishment of an alternative regional development model to slow death and pollution”. The protests underscore mounting pressure on President Kais Saied’s government , already grappling with a deep economic and financial crisis, to balance public health demands with the production of phosphate, Tunisia’s most valuable natural resource. In an effort to ease public anger, Saied met late on Saturday with the ministers of environment and energy, urging them to send delegations to Gabes to carry out necessary repairs at the phosphate acid unit of the complex. He said he wants “a green Tunisia free of all pollution”. Phosphate is Tunisia’s principal natural resource, but for years, activists have warned about the pollution caused by the GCT, which dumps its gaseous and solid waste directly into the environment . In 2017, authorities pledged to dismantle the Gabes complex and replace it with a facility that meets international standards, acknowledging that its emissions posed a danger to local residents. However, the plan has yet to be implemented. Meanwhile, Tunisia’s government aims to revive the phosphate industry by increasing production fivefold to 14 million tonnes by 2030 to capitalise on rising global demand.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/14/dozens-hospitalised-in-tunisias-gabes-amid-environmental-crisis,World,BBC,,https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/AFP__20250523__47XH39G__v6__HighRes__TunisiaIndustryEnvironmentPollutionHealth-1760459802.jpg?resize=1920%2C1440,,e18db26e784f79870824d54476382dae55038d10

6bc5b95d1921,Palestinians see ‘new Nakba’ in West Bank villages as demolitions return,"features, israel-palestine conflict, israel, middle east, palestine","Khallet al-Daba, occupied West Bank – At nine o’clock on a Monday morning in May, the quiet of Khallet al-Daba was shattered by the sound of bulldozers and other demolition vehicles approaching. Accompanying them were Israeli soldiers pouring into the village, forcing families out of their homes and driving livestock into the open. By the end of May 5, the small community in the heart of Masafer Yatta had been reduced to rubble. It was just one of at least four mass demolitions conducted by Israeli forces this year. For residents, the repeated demolitions are nothing less than a “new Nakba ” – an echo of the mass displacement and ethnic cleansing Palestinians suffered in 1948. Recommended Stories list of 3 items end of list Dozens of military vehicles, armoured carriers and jeeps sealed off the village as the demolitions took place in May, according to locals. Women carrying infants, men still dazed from being forced suddenly from their homes, and children screaming in fear stood under the burning sun for six hours. Behind them, the walls of their houses were turned into rubble. Families have since been attempting to adapt to a life uprooted. Some have sheltered in underground caves dug years ago as makeshift refuges. Others have crowded into fragile tents that cannot withstand either the scorching summer or the freezing winter. “This demolition destroyed the lifelines of Khallet al-Daba: water, electricity, solar energy, drinking wells, sewage tanks, and even street lighting,” said Mohammed Rabia, who is the head of the nearby at-Tuwani village council, and deals with Bedouin issues throughout Masafer Yatta. “We’ve returned to the Stone Age, living in caves and tents without the necessities of life… but no one has left the village.” The Palestinian residents of Khallet al-Daba were forced to leave the village as Israeli forces demolished structures in it in May [Mosab Shawer/Al Jazeera] Military training zones Khallet al-Daba lies at the heart of Masafer Yatta, a cluster of 12 Palestinian villages spread across rolling hills south of Hebron, in the southern West Bank. The United Nations has previously reported that 1,150 people live in Masafer Yatta, but Rabia says the true number is about 4,500 people. They mostly herd sheep and farm wheat and barley, which produces the majority of the income for the Palestinian population in this region. But, as with approximately 20 percent of land in the West Bank, Israel declared part of the area a military training zone – ‘Firing Zone 918’ – in the 1980s and has been trying to empty it of Palestinians ever since. The Israeli military has previously justified the May 5 demolition as necessary because of the location of the village in the military training zone. The practice of declaring areas of the West Bank military training zones was revealed by an Israeli-Palestinian research group, Akevot, as a tactic to expel Palestinian villagers proposed in 1981 by then-Agriculture Minister Ariel Sharon, who later became Israel’s prime minister in the early 2000s. Homes here are repeatedly demolished under military orders. Residents say the justifications vary – construction without permits, proximity to military training areas, or land claimed for settlement outposts – but the goal is the same: displacement. A press release last week from Frederieke van Dongen, the humanitarian affairs manager of the aid organisation Doctors Without Borders (MSF), agreed with that conclusion, calling Israel’s actions in Masafer Yatta “part of a broader policy of ethnic cleansing, aimed at forcibly transferring Palestinians from the area”. Some families in Khallet al-Daba have been forced to shelter in paved underground caves after the Israeli demolitions [Mosab Shawer/Al Jazeera] ‘If I leave, I will die’ Among those who were forced to watch their homes collapse this spring was 65-year-old Samiha Muhammad al-Dababseh, a mother of eight who has lived in the village her whole life. Her weathered face carries the strain of decades of hardship. “I screamed, ‘The army is here!’” she recalled. “Within minutes, soldiers were storming the houses, forcibly removing us without allowing us to take anything – not food or clothes. They pushed me violently and told me, ‘This is not your land. You will not have a home or shelter left.'” Samiha’s family had already endured three demolitions prior to May. After their stone house was destroyed in May, they were forced to return to a cave that Samiha had dug out by hand and turned into a shelter with her late husband. The women and children slept inside the cave, while the men spread out on the ground outside its entrance. But then, on September 17, even the cave was destroyed in yet another Israeli attack, which also targeted residential tents, water tanks, and mobile bathrooms, according to the villagers. “If one tree remains in Khallet al-Daba, I will stay in its shade,” Samiha said. The land is my soul. If I leave, I will die.” Samiha said that she was now living under a tree. “We live in fear of settler attacks, ” she explained. “Despite everything, we will not leave. Some Palestinians in Khallet al-Daba have resorted to living in tents after one of Israel’s latest demolitions in the village in September [Mosab Shawer/Al Jazeera] Living in fear Samiha’s youngest son, 31-year-old Mujahid al-Dababseh, shares a cave with his wife and three children – as well as 11 other relatives. The farmer says that nights in the cave can be long and frightening. “The children suffer from nightmares of bulldozers and settler attacks,” he said. “I fear [they will be attacked by] snakes, insects, or from thirst due to the lack of water. Our lives are very difficult; there is no electricity, no food, no safety.” Mujahid remembers placing stones with his father when they built their home. Watching it collapse was like losing “a piece of my life”, he said. “The [Israeli] occupation has turned Khallet al-Daba into a second Gaza – they wiped out everything above ground, leaving only rubble,” Mujahid said. “But they failed. No Palestinian child will ever emigrate from here.” The village is home to just 120 people, a third of them children, all members of the extended Dababseh clan. Its name recalls the hyenas (daba in Arabic) that once roamed the valleys. Today, residents say, it is settlers and soldiers who stalk their land. For many here, the repeated demolitions are not just about homes, but about erasing life itself – water wells, solar panels, sewage systems, even street lighting. Each time, residents rebuild what they can. Each time, they vow not to leave. Khallet al-Daba is now a patchwork of caves, rubble and tents. Yet it remains a symbol of Palestinian steadfastness, residents say, rooted in a struggle that has lasted more than seven decades. “This is an ongoing Nakba,” said Rabia. “But the people have chosen to resist with their presence. Four times, the houses fell. Four times, the people stayed.” Palestinians say that Israel’s repeated demolitions in Masafer Yatta are part of an attempt to ethnically cleanse them from the area [Mosab Shawer/Al Jazeera]",https://www.aljazeera.com/features/2025/10/14/palestinians-see-new-nakba-in-west-bank-villages-as-demolitions-return,World,BBC,Mosab Shawer,https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/9H6B6693-1760462184.jpg?resize=1920%2C1440,,557dc115cd5e22936fb82f7fe971184395100941

786f93b43521,‘The shining star of our family’: R&B singer D’Angelo passes away at age 51,"news, arts and culture, music, obituaries, united states, us & canada","Grammy-winning R&B singer D’Angelo has passed away at age 51 following a “prolonged and courageous battle with cancer”, according to a statement from his family. On Tuesday, his loved ones released a statement announcing his death. “The shining star of our family has dimmed his light for us in this life,” it read. Recommended Stories list of 3 items end of list “We are saddened that he can only leave dear memories with his family, but we are eternally grateful for the legacy of extraordinarily moving music he leaves behind.” D’Angelo, whose real name was Michael Eugene Archer, was best known for his silky vocals during the 1990s and 2000s, with his record Voodoo earning him the 2001 Grammy for Best R&B album. His hit single from that album, Untitled (How Does It Feel), not only won him another Grammy for Best Male R&B Vocal Performance, but it also catapulted him into the mainstream spotlight with its steamy music video, featuring a shirtless D’Angelo singing directly to the camera. The music publication Rolling Stone has ranked Voodoo as one of its best albums of all time. News of his passing prompted an outpouring of remembrances from fans, including fellow musicians. “I never met D’Angelo but I love him, respect him, admire his gift. This loss HURTS!!” singer-songwriter Jill Scott wrote on the social media platform X, adding: “R.I.P. GENIUS.” Another musician, rapper Doja Cat, offered condolences to D’Angelo’s loved ones. She called him “a true voice of soul and inspiration to many brilliant artists of our generation and generations to come”. D’Angelo performs at the Essence Music Festival in New Orleans, Louisiana, on July 6, 2012 [Cheryl Gerber/Invision via AP Photo] In his music, D’Angelo blended hip-hop grit, emphatic soul and gospel-rooted emotion into a sound that helped spearhead the neo-soul movement of the 1990s. Earlier this year, the Virginia native celebrated the 30th anniversary of his debut studio album Brown Sugar, a platinum-selling offering that produced signature hits like Lady. That 1995 album earned him multiple Grammy nominations and cemented him as one of R&B’s most original new voices. D’Angelo’s sultry vocal style — a mix of raspy texture and church-bred fluidity — set him apart from his peers. That voice became inseparable from the striking visuals of the Untitled (How Does It Feel) music video. Its minimalist aesthetic became a cultural touchstone, igniting conversations around artistry, sexuality and vulnerability in Black male representation. Beyond his own catalogue, D’Angelo’s artistry shone in collaborations. He memorably duetted with Lauryn Hill on the soulful ballad Nothing Even Matters, a highlight of her landmark 1998 album, The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill. He also contributed to The Roots’ 1996 album Illadelph Halflife and was part of the supergroup Black Men United, which yielded one song, U Will Know, for the film Jason’s Lyric in 1994. D’Angelo wrote and co-produced the single. D’Angelo received multiple Grammy nominations and two wins for his album Voodoo [Charles Sykes/Invision via AP Photo] D’Angelo was in a four-year relationship with Grammy-nominated R&B singer Angie Stone in the 1990s. The pair met while he was finishing the album Brown Sugar and bonded over their similar backgrounds: Both are from the South and both grew up in the church. Stone worked on the album with D’Angelo, and the pair co-wrote the song Everyday for her 1999 debut album, Black Diamond. Stone described D’Angelo as her “musical soul mate” in an interview with The Associated Press in 1999, adding that their working relationship was “like milk and cereal”. “Musically, it was magic,” Stone said. “It’s something that I have not been able to do with any other producer or musician.” They had a son together, the artist Swayvo Twain, born Michael Archer Jr. Stone died earlier this year in a car crash. She was 63. D’Angelo also has a daughter, Imani Archer. Among the tributes to D’Angelo’s artistry on Tuesday was a social media post from Tyler, the Creator, who reminisced about combing his local music store on his ninth birthday. “I had $20 in birthday money and my eyes set on leaving with one thing. VOODOO by D’Angelo,” Tyler, the Creator, wrote on Instagram. “I had no idea that would help shape my musical dna.” “I couldn’t understand how someone could write something so simple but personal but broad but genius,” he continued. “Thats how special he was.” The actor and musician Jamie Foxx, meanwhile, offered his memories of seeing D’Angelo perform live at the concert venue House of Blues. “Your voice was silky and flawless,” Foxx wrote on Instagram, addressing the late D’Angelo directly. “I was also in pure awe of your talents…. roaming around on each instrument, displaying your expertise in every note and every song.” Foxx added that D’Angelo would be missed forever. “That’s why today real tears run down my face.”",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/14/the-shining-star-of-our-family-rb-singer-dangelo-passes-away-at-age-51,World,BBC,,https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/AP25274696172701-1760462122.jpg?resize=1920%2C1440,,31336714784543b50b731b570cf65aecde09a13e
b08f413bb8c0,"Control, choke points: The battle lines in southern Sudan","news, explainer, humanitarian crises, sudan war, middle east, sudan","Recent battlefield gains by the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) may turn the tide in Kordofan, analysts have told Al Jazeera. Sudan’s devastating war between the SAF and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) has raged for two and a half years, resulting in massive displacement and the world’s worst humanitarian crisis, according to the United Nations. Yet SAF’s capture in September of the strategic city of Bara, which the RSF was using for logistics, supplies, and as a muster point for reinforcements, is seen as a sign that SAF may have swung the pendulum in its favour. Why is Bara important? Bara lies about 350km (217 miles) southwest of the capital Khartoum along the “Export Road” used to truck goods from Khartoum to el-Obeid, capital of North Kordofan State. It also exports its own agricultural products and livestock to the rest of Sudan. The Khartoum-el-Obeid connection is vital because from el-Obeid, roads lead outwards to South Sudan and Sudan’s east and Darfur in the west. From Khartoum, roads lead northeast to Port Sudan on the Red Sea, where the wartime government was until recently. Roads also lead north to Egypt and east to Eritrea and Ethiopia. SAF took el-Obeid in February, after a two-year RSF siege, and took Khartoum in March, so taking Bara gave it solid control over the Export Road to use as a supply route, independent Sudanese military and political analyst Akram Ali told Al Jazeera. (Al Jazeera) Bara and el-Obeid lie near the westernmost reaches of SAF control, well to the east of el-Fasher, the capital of North Darfur and the last city SAF holds in the vast western region. Between the two is a stretch of RSF control – and siege on el-Fasher – that SAF has to breach. For the RSF, keeping Bara and a foothold in Kordofan was important because it allowed it to put pressure on SAF, which holds territory to the north, and to link the areas it controls in Kordofan and Darfur to South Sudan, links it uses to move weapons and fighters. How did SAF take Bara? The army launched an offensive on Bara from the south on September 11, while RSF defences were concentrated on the eastern side, analyst Abdul Majeed Abdul Hamid said. SAF sent continuous drone strikes against RSF targets, then launched the Darfur Track Armed Struggle Movement, an assault force known for mobility and speed, from el-Obeid. The force successfully engaged and defeated the RSF unit defending Bara, then entered the city with heavy firepower, according to a military officer who spoke on condition of anonymity. The officer said the operation relied on speed and keeping the RSF occupied on several fronts to prevent it from sending reinforcements. Most of Bara’s civilians supported SAF, according to Abdul Hamid, and the RSF quickly retreated. The operation cut off RSF supply and military support lines, he added, isolating their remaining positions in areas such as al-Khuwei to the west and al-Nahud to the east. For the RSF, keeping Bara and a foothold in Kordofan was important because it allowed it to put pressure on SAF, which holds territory to the north, and to link the areas it controls in Kordofan and Darfur to South Sudan, links it uses to move weapons and fighters. Losing Bara also meant that the RSF could no longer keep the city of el-Obeid under siege. Will the RSF lose the Kordofans? The RSF announced in February this year that it had entered an alliance with the Southern People’s Liberation Movement-North (SPLM-N). South Kordofan includes the Abyei region, disputed between Sudan and South Sudan. The SPLM-N controls the vast, isolated Nuba Mountains region in South Kordofan, right up against the border with South Sudan. However, despite that new stronghold, analysts told Al Jazeera that losing control over the Export Road spells a serious deterioration in the RSF’s power in the Kordofans. “The army’s entry into el-Obeid marked the beginning of their actual collapse,” said Ali. Widespread disease outbreaks have overwhelmed hospitals in war-torn Sudan [Screengrab/Al Jazeera] An army unit called “Al-Sayyad” – named after a commander killed in the early days of the war – had moved from Rabak, capital of White Nile State, in a campaign that eventually reached el-Obeid. Political analyst Ahmed Shomokh said liberating Bara opens the door to reactivating the SAF air base in el-Obeid, the largest in Kordofan, after two years of inactivity, “significantly [enhancing] the logistical and combat capabilities of the Sudanese army” and helping SAF’s campaign to expel RSF from the Kordofans. Taking back all of Kordofan would allow SAF to work towards liberating Darfur, Abdul Hamid said. “The army has combat experience and personnel capable of liberating Kordofan with the same capabilities it used to retake the cities of central Sudan and the capital,” Abdul Hamid continued. The war has killed tens of thousands of people and displaced more than 10 million in what has become the world’s largest humanitarian crisis. According to the UN, a total of 24.6 million people face acute food insecurity, while 19 million people lack access to safe water and sanitation.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/14/control-choke-points-the-battle-lines-in-southern-sudan,World,BBC,,https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/ap_68ee70eb1a027-1760456939.jpg?resize=1920%2C1440,,9ab774cf7a6fd416ea0c4e97f23be056f7f8ba91

Some demonstrators carried red prohibition signs with the number 67 on them, in reference to a planned increase in the retirement age. “Right to a pension at 65,” the signs read. Others sported a picture of conservative Prime Minister Bart De Wever with the caption “wanted for pension theft”. Riot police arrest a protester on the sidelines of a demonstration in Brussels, Belgium, October 14 [Nicolas Tucat/AFP] “We are heading towards a future that doesn’t look good,” one protester, 59-year-old Chantal Desmet, told the AFP news agency. “The government has to take notice.” Flights cancelled at Brussels International Walkouts from airport security staff caused all departing flights to be cancelled at the country’s main airport – Brussels International Airport – the facility said, while protests forced cuts on most of Brussels’s underground train, bus and tram lines, according to public transport operator STIB. The protest is the latest this year against a push by De Wever’s coalition government – which faces a budget deficit that violates EU rules and is trying to find some $12bn in savings – to introduce cuts to pensions and healthcare systems. But the prime minister’s plans have infuriated the country’s powerful trade unions, which are leading the protest and nationwide strikes.

Hot air! And once again, everyone is paying, except the rich,” said trade union CSC, as it urged people to join Tuesday’s protest. The action is ramping up pressure on De Wever, who has pledged to cut deficits without raising taxes but is struggling to finalise next year’s budget.

217c3ad184f3,A Quarter of the CDC Is Gone,"cdc, robert f. kennedy jr., public health, government","After the latest round of mass firings at the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention over the weekend, the union that represents agency employees estimates that around 3,000 people this year—about a quarter of the agency’s workforce—have departed the agency. That number includes workers affected by layoffs earlier this year , as well those who have accepted the Trump administration’s “Fork in the Road” buyout program. The most recent cuts came down amid the ongoing government shutdown. On October 10, more than 1,300 CDC employees received termination notices. Soon after, however, about 700 of those people were told via email that they were mistakenly terminated and were not in fact subject to the reduction in force. An estimated 600 people remain terminated. An additional 1,300 CDC employees are, according to the union, on administrative leave and being paid but not working. The Trump administration has not shared official numbers of those targeted by the reductions. The estimate was compiled by the American Federation of Government Employees (AFGE) Local 2883, which represents CDC workers. The current round of reductions affects the National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion, the National Center for Health Statistics, the CDC library, the agency’s human resources department, campus safety staff, as well as the CDC’s office in Washington, DC, which acts as a liaison to Congress and provides public health information to policymakers. “All HHS employees receiving reduction-in-force notices were designated nonessential by their respective divisions,” Andrew Nixon, director of communication at the Department of Health and Human Services, told WIRED via email. Among those reinstated include staff that publish the agency’s flagship publication, the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report, as well as leadership in the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases and National Center for Emerging and Zoonotic Infectious Diseases, according to AFGE.

98d250a7e3fe,A New Attack Lets Hackers Steal 2-Factor Authentication Codes From Android Phones,"ars technica, cybersecurity, hacking, malware, vulnerabilities, security, hacks, android, google, samsung","Android devices are vulnerable to a new attack that can covertly steal two-factor authentication codes, location timelines, and other private data in less than 30 seconds. The new attack, named Pixnapping by the team of academic researchers who devised it, requires a victim to first install a malicious app on an Android phone or tablet. The app, which requires no system permissions, can then effectively read data that any other installed app displays on the screen. Pixnapping has been demonstrated on Google Pixel phones and the Samsung Galaxy S25 phone and likely could be modified to work on other models with additional work. Google released mitigations last month, but the researchers said a modified version of the attack works even when the update is installed. Like Taking a Screenshot Pixnapping attacks begin with the malicious app invoking Android programming interfaces that cause the authenticator or other targeted apps to send sensitive information to the device screen. The malicious app then runs graphical operations on individual pixels of interest to the attacker. Pixnapping then exploits a side channel that allows the malicious app to map the pixels at those coordinates to letters, numbers, or shapes. “Anything that is visible when the target app is opened can be stolen by the malicious app using Pixnapping,” the researchers wrote on an informational website . “Chat messages, 2FA codes, email messages, etc. are all vulnerable since they are visible. If an app has secret information that is not visible (e.g., it has a secret key that is stored but never shown on the screen), that information cannot be stolen by Pixnapping.” The new attack class is reminiscent of GPU.zip , a 2023 attack that allowed malicious websites to read the usernames, passwords, and other sensitive visual data displayed by other websites. It worked by exploiting side channels found in GPUs from all major suppliers. The vulnerabilities that GPU.zip exploited have never been fixed. Instead, the attack was blocked in browsers by limiting their ability to open iframes, an HTML element that allows one website (in the case of GPU.zip, a malicious one) to embed the contents of a site from a different domain. Pixnapping targets the same side channel as GPU.zip, specifically the precise amount of time it takes for a given frame to be rendered on the screen.",https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/10/no-fix-yet-for-attack-that-lets-hackers-pluck-2fa-codes-from-android-phones,Technology,BBC,"Dan Goodin, Ars Technica","https://media.wired.com/photos/68eea04bb966a95f54c9f532/191:100/w_1280,c_limit/GettyImages-1816802439.jpg",2025-10-14T21:40:00+00:00,c92a7c6f4f98142f2f2a43bd448ddfb6c3e6e361
c228ce72cf99,A Plan to Rebuild Gaza Lists Nearly 30 Companies. Many Say They’re Not Involved,"israel, architecture, palestine, war, politics, donald trump, ikea, tesla","“These constraints include barriers to movement of people and goods from the West Bank and Gaza, restrictions on aquifer access, and limits on mobile communications standards,” reads one section focused on these constraints. “They also impose low-quota restrictions on banking activities (e.g., cash shekel transfers to Israeli banks).” Compared to redevelopment, however, a much more immediate concern is increasing the amount of food and medical aid entering Gaza. For many months, Israel has been severely restricting the number of aid trucks allowed into Gaza. The Integrated Food Security Phase Classification, a UN-backed system for addressing hunger, said in July that a “worst-case scenario” is playing out in Gaza. Under the current terms of the peace treaty, the number of aid trucks allowed to enter Gaza each day will increase to a maximum of 400—but only for the first five days after the treaty is finalized, though the number of trucks may increase in later stages. The GHF adviser estimated that just 20 trucks entered the strip on a typical day. It’s not clear whether the GHF alone will be expected to bring in many more aid trucks per day or whether that responsibility will be distributed among multiple aid groups, according to the GHF adviser. The primary barriers from an influx of aid, the adviser adds, are whether the prisoner exchange proceeds as planned and whether the Israeli military speedily approves new sites to distribute aid. There have been delays in these sites being approved. Mike Huckabee, the US ambassador to Israel, announced in early August that GHF would soon increase its number of distribution sites from four to 16. Shortly after, the GHF adviser claims, the foundation had readied plans on how to open the sites, but they say GHF lacked permission from Israel to do so. “The proof of concept had been done at that point,” they tell WIRED. “And we really thought it was going to grow, but it hasn't.” Update 10/14/25 5:20pm ET: This story has been updated to include a comment from the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation.",https://www.wired.com/story/a-plan-to-rebuild-gaza-lists-nearly-30-companies-many-say-theyre-not-involved,Technology,BBC,Caroline Haskins,"https://media.wired.com/photos/68ed4634d9a0d6c1df85c0c8/191:100/w_1280,c_limit/biz-gaza-rebuild-2235033539.jpg",2025-10-14T20:13:09.074000+00:00,d382343e89a7f7d10c13b40c042fac27f0c3b5ce
803c299e78b3,Interstellar Comet 3I/ATLAS Is Spewing Water Like a Cosmic Fire Hydrant,"science, comet, space, nasa, telescope","Comet 3I/Atlas continues to be full of surprises. As well as being only the third interstellar object ever detected, new analysis shows it is producing hydroxyl (OH) emissions, with these compounds betraying the presence of water on its surface. This discovery was made by a team of researchers at Auburn University in Alabama using NASA’s Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory, and was described in a study published in The Astrophysical Journal Letters . Hydroxyl compounds are detectable via the ultraviolet signature they produce. But on Earth, a lot of UV wavelengths are blocked by the atmosphere, which is why the researchers had to use the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory—a space telescope free from interference experienced by observatories on Earth. Water is present in virtually every comet seen in the solar system, so much so that the chemical and physical reactions of water are used to measure, catalog, and track these celestial objects and how they react to the heat of the sun. Finding it on 3I/ATLAS means being able to study its characteristics using the same scale used for regular comets, and this information could in future be useful data for studying the processes of comets that originate in other star systems as well. “When we detect water—or even its faint ultraviolet echo, OH—from an interstellar comet, we’re reading a note from another planetary system,” said Dennis Bodewits, an Auburn University physicist who collaborated on the research, in a press statement . “It tells us that the ingredients for life’s chemistry are not unique to our own.” Comets are frozen hunks of rock, gases, and dust that usually orbit stars (the exceptions being the three interstellar objects found so far). When they’re far away from a star, they’re completely frozen, but as they get closer, solar radiation causes their frozen elements to heat up and sublimate—turn from solid into gas—with some of this material emitted from the comet’s nucleus thanks to the star’s energy, forming a “tail.” But with 3I/ATLAS, data collected revealed an unexpected detail: OH production by the comet was already happening far away from the sun—when the comet was more than three times farther from the sun than the Earth—in a region of the solar system where temperatures normally aren’t sufficient to easily produce the sublimation of ice. Already at that distance, however, 3I/ATLAS was leaking water at the rate of about 40 kilograms per second, a flow comparable—the study authors explain—to that of a “hydrant at maximum power.” This detail would seem to indicate a more complex structure than what is usually observed in comets in the solar system. It could, for example, be explained by the presence of small fragments of ice detaching from the comet’s nucleus, and which are then vaporized by the heat of sunlight, going on to feed a gaseous cloud that surrounds the celestial body. This is something that has so far been observed only in a small number of extremely distant comets, and which could provide valuable information about the processes from which 3I/ATLAS originated. “Every interstellar comet so far has been a surprise,” said Zexi Xing, an Auburn University researcher and coauthor of the discovery, in a press statement . “‘Oumuamua was dry, Borisov was rich in carbon monoxide, and now ATLAS is giving up water at a distance where we didn’t expect it. Each one is rewriting what we thought we knew about how planets and comets form around stars.” This story originally appeared on WIRED Italia and has been translated from Italian.",https://www.wired.com/story/interstellar-comet-3i-atlas-is-spewing-water-like-a-cosmic-fire-hydrant,Technology,BBC,Simone Valesini,"https://media.wired.com/photos/68ee73725e8cd475a202eac2/191:100/w_1280,c_limit/SPHERExImage1-ezgif.com-crop.jpg",2025-10-14T19:03:23.943000+00:00,f899c3c31cf0cbd23500ea96485d0fa21ad38e01
827ced5e7e68,Do You Really Have to Stop Using Windows 10?,"windows, how-to, operating systems, microsoft, software","So you might not have the money to buy a new computer at the moment. What can you do instead? Replace Windows with another operating system, and ideally one that will keep getting security updates. This is going to require some tech skills on your part, but don't worry: It's mostly a matter of following instructions. Option 3: Turn Your PC Into a Chromebook Have you ever used a Chromebook? It's just a laptop that can only run Google's Chrome browser. Such devices tend to run well despite typically having substandard components, so it’s particularly useful for an older laptop. In the past few years Google launched ChromeOS Flex , which allows you to install ChromeOS on your own device. There's a good chance it can run on your old computer. There are downsides here. If you rely on a particular piece of Windows software, you won't be able to use it in ChromeOS. You will only be able to run web apps that load in the browser. If you mostly just use the Chrome web browser, though, there's a good chance you won't miss Windows at all. If you're curious, WIRED has a handy ChromeOS Flex guide , and Google offers instructions for home installation . Basically you need to check if your laptop is supported, put the operating system on a flash drive, and then boot from the flash drive. Note that installing a new operating system will delete everything currently on your computer, so make sure to back up photos and documents before doing this. Option 4: Embrace Linux ChromeOS is easy to use, but not everyone can live their entire life in a browser window. If you want to replace Windows with a more feature-filled operating system, it's time to look into Linux. This is a completely free alternative to Windows, and it tends to run better on older devices than Windows. Linux has a reputation for being fussy, and depending on which version of Linux you decide to use it really can be. But there are versions of Linux that treat ease-of-use as a marquee feature. Linux Mint is a solid starting point for most people, and it offers great step-by-step instructions for getting started . As with ChromeOS, you will need to download the operating system, load it to a flash drive, then boot from the flash drive, and finally install the operating system (which will delete everything currently on your computer). If any of this is too much for you to figure out, there's an easier way: Ask all of your friends if any of them are Linux users. If they are, offer to buy them a 12-pack in exchange for helping you set up Linux—I promise you it will get done. They can also teach you the basics and show you how to navigate around your new system. Because there will be an adjustment. We're talking about a brand-new operating system. If you want to get a few more years out of your computer, though, Linux is probably your best choice, even if it means a bit of a learning curve. Update: October 14, 12 pm.

Amazon currently has Apple AirTags in a four pack marked down to just $65, an excellent price for these easy-to-use location tracking devices. While there are plenty of similar tracking tags on the market, Apple’s AirTags have some unique features that set them apart. Probably the most relevant is that they leverage Apple's entire network of devices for tracking, rather than just your phone, or other users who happen to have the company's app installed. That means they're more likely to show up as they get further away from you, and you can set them as lost in the system to notify you when they come within range of an iPhone or iPad. They're also extremely easy to set up and pair to your phone, thanks to the close pairing of Apple's hardware and iOS software. Just tap the AirTag to your phone to connect it to your account, and you're ready to go. They're compact enough that they can squeeze into basically anywhere, including on a keychain or tucked into a small purse. You can also share them with up to five family members, in case you need to help your significant other track down their keys. Apple has put a ton of work into making the AirTag super useful while also keeping an eye on safety and security concerns. Both Apple and Android phones will warn you if an AirTag not linked to your account is following you around, and they'll even beep occasionally when they aren't within range of any Apple devices on the Find My network. The biggest downside to the Apple AirTag is that it doesn't work with Android devices at all, except for the safety warning. If you aren't an iPhone owner, make sure to check out our other favorite tracking devices to keep your belongings safe .

Now law enforcement has carried out one of its biggest operations yet against that sprawling scam industry, targeting the operators of several modern slavery scam compounds in Southeast Asia—where, as a whole, hundreds of thousands of human trafficking victims have been forced to run the fraud operations on behalf of criminal gangs. On Tuesday, officials in the United States and United Kingdom took coordinated action against one giant Cambodian organization and its boss who has allegedly run a series of notorious scam centers in the country. The US Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) announced it has issued financial sanctions against 146 “targets” linked to the newly designated Prince Group Transnational Criminal Organization. This action includes targeting individuals and shell companies linked to the alleged criminal enterprise. As part of the sweeping action also involving the FBI, the US Department of Justice (DOJ) has also seized almost 130,000 bitcoin worth around $15 billion at the time of the announcement—the largest US cryptocurrency seizure to date. This Prince Group organized crime entity, OFAC says, is made up of the Prince Holding Group, a Cambodia-based company, its chairman and CEO Chen Zhi, and his associates and business partners. Publicly, the company describes itself as “one of the largest conglomerates in Cambodia” and says it is involved in real estate development and financial services. However, the DOJ alleges that “in secret” Chen and other executives “grew Prince Group into one of Asia’s largest transnational criminal organizations” and ran at least 10 scam compounds across Cambodia. “As alleged, the defendant directed one of the largest investment fraud operations in history, fueling an illicit industry that is reaching epidemic proportions,” said Joseph Nocella Jr., a US attorney for the Eastern District of New York, in a statement . “Prince Group’s investment scams have caused billions of dollars in losses and untold misery to victims around the world.” Chen has not been arrested and remains at large, the DOJ says. “The masterminds behind these horrific scam centers are ruining the lives of vulnerable people and buying up London homes to store their money,” Britain’s foreign secretary, Yvette Cooper, said in a statement . The UK also placed financial sanctions on Chen, the Prince Group, and other linked entities. The UK’s sanctions also “freeze” businesses and properties allegedly linked to Chen in London, including a £12 million ($16 million) mansion in North London and a £100 million ($133 million) office building in the City of London.

Any watch fan looking to tick all of the above boxes would normally expect to be a dab hand with a spring bar removal tool to experience all the above individually, but a new strap developed by Malaysian independent brand Ming appears to now offer the best of all worlds. Photograph: Courtesy of Ming The one strap to rule them all has been dubbed the Polymesh . It is 3D-printed from grade 5 titanium and comprises 1,693 interconnected pieces (including the buckle), held together without any pins or screws. The only additional parts requiring assembly are the quick-release spring bars at each end that attach it to the watch—the articulated pin buckle is also formed in the same process. Ming says the strap, made up of rows of 15 equilateral triangles meshed together and bookended by larger end pieces, “has more motion engineered into the radial axis than the lateral one,” leading to a supple end result that drapes like fabric yet retains the strength of titanium. It has taken the company seven years to develop, working with partners Sisma SpA in Italy and ProMotion SA in Switzerland. Ming says notable challenges included the risk of components fusing together, and the fact that powdered titanium—the raw material from which the strap is laser sintered—is highly explosive. Each strap takes several hours to produce, requiring hundreds of layers of additive manufacturing in an inert gas environment. The company is not the first to use 3D-printing techniques for final products in watchmaking (as opposed to prototyping), but it is the only one using it for straps or bracelets. British start-up Apiar has debuted a 3D-printed watch case, as has Dutch brand Holthinrichs , which has created versions of its Ornament 1 in both 18-karat gold as well as stainless steel. The Case for Straps To the extent that straps have been an area for innovation in the watch world, recent attention has tended to focus on brands’ development of proprietary mechanisms for swappable straps, to varying degrees of success and popularity. Sustainability programs have focused on leather alternatives such as reclaimed apple peel or mushroom-based material, or textiles woven from ocean plastic . Some have proven difficult to industrialize, and nearly all have been dogged by accusations of greenwashing.

aab6aaa1e3c5,‘Sovereign AI’ Has Become a New Front in the US-China Tech War,"model behavior, artificial intelligence, openai, deepseek, china, donald trump, open source","OpenAI has announced a number of projects this year with foreign governments to help build out what it has called their “sovereign AI” systems. The company says the deals, some of which are being coordinated with the US government, are part of a broader push to give national leaders more control over a technology that could reshape their economies. Over the past few months, sovereign AI has become something of a buzzword in both Washington and Silicon Valley. Proponents of the concept argue it's crucial that AI systems developed in democratic nations are able to proliferate globally, particularly as China races to deploy its own AI technology abroad. “The distribution and diffusion of American technology will stop our strategic rivals from making our allies dependent on foreign adversary technology,” the Trump administration said in its AI Action Plan released in July. At OpenAI, this movement has also meant partnering with countries like the United Arab Emirates, which is ruled by a federation of monarchies. OpenAI’s chief strategy officer, Jason Kwon, argues that partnering with non-Democratic governments can help them evolve to become more liberal. “There’s a bet that you make that engagement is better than containment,” Kwon said in an interview with WIRED last week at the Curve conference in Berkeley, California. “Sometimes that works, and sometimes it hasn't.” Kwon’s reasoning echoes what some politicians said about China more than two decades ago. “We can work to pull China in the right direction, or we can turn our backs and almost certainly push it in the wrong direction,” US president Bill Clinton said in 2000 when China was gearing up to join the World Trade Organization. Since then, many American companies have gotten rich by trading with China, but the country’s government has only become more authoritarian. Some people argue that true sovereignty can only be achieved if a government is able to inspect—and to some extent control—the AI model in question. “In my opinion, there is no sovereignty without open source,” says Clément Delangue, the CEO of Hugging Face, a company that hosts open source AI models. In this respect, China is already ahead, as its open source models are quickly becoming popular globally. What Is “Sovereign AI” Actually? Today’s sovereign AI projects range from giving countries partial to full control over the entire tech stack, meaning the government manages all of the AI infrastructure, from hardware to software. “The one common underlying thing for all of them is the legality portion—by having at least some part of the infrastructure tied to geographical boundaries, the design, development, and deployment would then adhere to some national laws,” says Trisha Ray, an associate director at the Atlantic Council’s GeoTech Center. The deal OpenAI announced in partnership with the US government in the UAE includes a 5 gigawatt data center cluster in Abu Dhabi (200 megawatts of the total planned capacity is supposed to come online in 2026). The UAE is also deploying ChatGPT nationwide, but it doesn’t appear that the government will have any ability to look under the hood or alter the chatbot’s inner workings. Only a few years ago, the idea of building AI infrastructure in authoritarian countries might have sparked worker protests in Silicon Valley. In 2019, Google employees pushed back against the tech giant’s plan to deploy a censored search engine in China, eventually succeeding in getting the project canceled. “What's happening with some of these LLM projects, it's quite similar, but there isn't as much of a backlash,” Ray says. “That notion of, ‘well, yes, if you're operating within a country's borders, you have to adhere to all laws of the land,’ that's become a lot more normalized over time.”",https://www.wired.com/story/openai-sovereign-ai-us-china-tech-war,Technology,BBC,Zoë Schiffer,"https://media.wired.com/photos/68ed60d1bfe13206c9ff9d9f/191:100/w_1280,c_limit/Biz-model-behavior-stargate-uae-2236543888.jpg",2025-10-14T16:00:00+00:00,4ce3081eedc484f9e178c9f26114969640647155

Even if you start cracking into your calendar after December 1, don’t worry; a lot of Advent calendars are just 12 days. Plus, who needs rules? Just double up on treats if you start late! Be sure to check out our other gift guides, including the Best Gifts for Newlyweds , the Best Gifts for Bird Lovers , and the Best Gifts for Golfers . Updated October 2025: We've refreshed this guide with new Advent calendars for 2025.

fda66cdc5272,The Best Wireless Headphones,"shopping, buying guides, headphones, bluetooth, music, audio, wireless earbuds","Other Wireless Headphones We’ve Tested Wireless headphones are the default these days, and there are roughly 1 gazillion of them (and counting). We do our best to test them all, but not everything we test can make the big list. Here are some other good options worth trying. Status Audio Pro X for $249 : The Status Audio Pro X are an excellent pair of earbuds that are slightly overshadowed by their mainstream competitors when it comes to daily use. That said, these buds look and sound awesome, with a triple driver array (one dynamic for bass, two Knowles balanced armatures for mid and high end), which allows them to stand above many other earbuds. Sony WH-1000XM5 for $398 : Sony's XM5 remain a top headphone, even after being supplanted by the fancier XM6. For a fairly sizable price reduction, you'll get still-fabulous noise-canceling tech, great sound, and luxe comfort in a supremely portable package. Beyerdynamic Amiron 300 for $280: These premium earbuds from Beyerdynamic are nondescript-looking and don't have noise-canceling to compete with Sony and Bose, but they do sound fantastic. If you're looking for a great-sounding pair that won't get you judged in public, these are a great option for quiet luxury. Bowers & Wilkins Pi8 Earbuds for $467: Bowers & Wilkins brings its speaker prowess into the world if high-end earbuds. The Pi8 provide a premium and stylish build, excellent sound quality, and solid noise canceling, albeit at a very high price point. Like other earbuds we've tested lately, one of the Pi8's coolest features is the ability to stream audio from wired audio sources via the charging case, which can really come in handy on long flights. Edifier Stax Spirit S5 for $500: These high-flying headphones lack noise-canceling, but make up for it with fantastically clear sound from their advanced planar magnetic drivers that use specialized magnet tech for vividly clear delivery. If you can afford their high price, they're a fun investment that digs into the meat of your music like few headphones in their class. Soundcore Space A40 for $45 : Even though they've moved off our main list, the Space A40 are still among the best earbuds you'll find for the money. Their stylish, premium-looking design is bolstered by solid features, clear and detailed sound, and excellent noise canceling for the price. Sonos Ace for $399: The Sonos Ace are a pricey but impressive first effort from Sonos, with fantastic noise canceling, great sound, and one of the comfiest designs (if not the comfiest) you'll find in the game. A few initial software bugs hindered their performance upon release, including trouble with the TV Swap feature that lets you pass sound from a Sonos soundbar to the Ace, but that seems to be fixed, making these an excellent choice—especially for those already invested in the Sonos way. Beats Solo 4 for $150: We like Beats headphones these days, but this pair was just a bit lacking in features for us at its standard $200 price. Now that they've come down, we can heartily recommend them to folks who are looking for a pair of wireless headphones that don't have noise canceling. Technics EAH-AZ80 for $161 : The AZ80 are great earbuds. Their most noteworthy feature is conveniently pairing to three devices at once, but they finish strong with good noise-canceling tech, top-tier sound quality, and seven different ear tip options for a remarkably comfy fit. Beats Studio Pro for $250 : The Studio Pro offer quality performance, including surprisingly clear sound, good noise canceling, and refreshingly natural transparency mode. The design feels a bit cheap, and they skip features like auto-pause, but extras like Hands-Free Siri and head tracking with spatial audio help pad their value—especially since their sale price sometimes drops to around half of the original $350 MSRP. Sony WH-CH720N for $129 : These Sony cans may have a silly name, but their sheer value makes up for it. They're not as pliable as top options and don't come with a case, but their sound quality and noise-canceling are excellent for the money. They are also built to last and have battery life that goes on and on, making them a great option for prudent shoppers. Master & Dynamic MH40 for $399 : M&D's second-gen MH40 pack gorgeous sound into an equally gorgeous design, with luxurious trappings like lambskin leather and metal parts in place of plastic. Their lack of advanced features, excluding even noise canceling, makes them a pricey portal to minimalism, but they've got style for days. Audio Technica ATH-M50xBT for $219 : The original ATH-M50X provide balanced sound and great durability, making them ubiquitous in music and film studios. But what if you want to take them with you between takes? Enter the ATH-M50XBT, which partner a wired studio connection with Bluetooth for wireless freedom. They don't offer noise canceling or other advanced features but they're great for melding art and play. Sony Linkbuds for $128 : The Linkbuds have a neat trick: speakers with holes in the middle that let in the world around you for environmental awareness. They're not so hot for noisy environments, making them something of a one-trick pony, but they're among the best options in the growing open-ear trend. They've also been updated in the new Linkbuds Open , which are pricier at present but offer a few new features and a more stable fit. JLab Jbuds Mini for $40 : These micro-buds from JLab offer so-so sound, but their adorably teensy design that fits on a key ring makes them a fun accessory for those who need some cheap buds to take on the go. AccordionItemContainerButton If you're new to wireless headphones or need a refresher, here are some helpful pointers to know before you buy. Noise canceling is a technology that employs exterior microphones and digital processing to take in the sounds around you and flip their frequency polarity, essentially canceling them at rapid speeds to create an impression of silence. Transparency mode , aka ""hear-through"" or “ambient” sound mode, is the opposite of noise canceling, using your headphones' exterior microphones to bring in the sound around you. This can keep you aware of your surroundings, especially helpful when working out, walking in high-traffic areas, or just having a quick conversation. Bluetooth is the wireless format used by all portable wireless headphones to connect to and play sound from devices like a phone, computer, or tablet. Bluetooth multipoint connection allows Bluetooth headphones to connect to more than one source device (like a phone or computer) at a time. This helpful feature lets you seamlessly switch between your connected devices to do things like take phone or video calls or watch a video on your computer between Spotify sessions on your phone. Find My is an Apple feature that lets you track down devices like your AirPods from the web. Many non-Apple wireless headphones also have some form of Find My feature, though it's usually reserved for earbuds due to their small size. IP ratings are used to certify electronics are dust and water-resistant. Generally, the higher the IP rating a device has, the better the dust and water resistance. You can learn more in our IP-ratings explainer . EQ stands for equalization, which in the case of wireless headphones, uses digital processing to adjust parameters like bass, midrange, and treble. EQ presets are most common, but multi-band EQs are better for those who want advanced control over each sound register. Charging cases are included with virtually all fully wireless earbuds, letting you set the buds in the case for recharging on the go. Most charging cases offer two or more charges, and to recharge the case itself, you can usually use a USB-C cable or a wireless charger . AccordionItemContainerButton We test headphones and earbuds the way that we live. We take them to the gym, wear them around offices, travel with them, and generally try to use them as we anticipate potential buyers will use them. If a pair advertises dust or water resistance, we test that. We drop test cases, test cables, charging times, and battery life, and note everything we find exceptional to our readers. While we do not typically use a set playlist of music to test each pair, we aim to test acoustic, rock, hip-hop, pop, country, and a variety of other genres with every pair of headphones, ensuring offer a good perspective on sound signature across genres and volumes. For noise reduction, we test the headphones in real-world environments and note our findings. When possible, we attempt to have headphones worn by a variety of people with different head and ear shapes, to ensure we're thinking about the widest audience possible.

9b46d93f8b53,The Best Wireless Earbuds We've Tested,"shopping, buying guides, wireless earbuds, earbuds, headphones, audio","Other Earbuds We Like Every month seems to bring new sets of earbuds with longer battery life, new features, and more compact designs. As such, we can't list everything we like. But if you're still hunting, here are some other recommendations. Beyerdynamic Amiron 300 for $180: These premium earbuds from Beyerdynamic look nondescript and sound fantastic, but they lack any of the superlative qualities of the buds on the list above. If you're after a clean-looking pair of headphones with fantastic vocal definition, they're worth considering. Soundcore Space A40 for $45 : While they're no longer on our main list, the Space A40 are still some of my favorite buds for the money, providing good features, clear sound, and excellent noise canceling for their price class. They also look polished, with only their lack of auto-pause sensors betraying their low price. Samsung Galaxy Buds 2 Pro for $100–$200: The Galaxy Buds 2 Pro are getting older, but they're still among the best buds to pair with a Samsung phone . They don't have the multi-device connectivity of our top pick for Android users, and their five-hour battery is looking pretty short these days, but they provide excellent sound quality, IPX7 waterproofing, and a distinctive design that doesn't just ape the AirPods Pro. That makes them well worth considering on sale. Soundpeats Air4 for $90 : Soundpeats’ Air4 may be obvious AirPods Pro knockoffs, but they're very good knockoffs for the money. You won't get top-flight performance, let alone Apple exclusives like Find My support or iCloud sharing, but you will get good sound and features, including decent noise canceling, at a massive discount. While these aren't a top choice, they're a great budget buy, especially on sale. Sony Linkbuds Fit for $175 : Sony’s Linkbuds Fit offer rich and punchy sound, naturalistic transparency mode, and a light and comfy fit, helping them live up to their intent as a “wear anywhere” solution. They provide some solid features, but skimp on battery life with just 5.5 hours per charge, and their noise canceling is just OK. Their oddly unresponsive touch controls and reliance on flimsy silicone sleeves further diminish their value, but they're still Sony buds and could be worth nabbing on a good sale. Montblanc MTB 03 for $395 : These earbuds are priced out of reach for most buyers, but if you've got the cash, you'll be rewarded with a luxury experience worthy of the brand. Montblanc has called in some heavy hitters from the audio industry to design and voice these buds. The result is a small, comfortable, and quite flashy-looking pair of wireless earbuds that sound really impressive. Raycon Everyday Earbuds for $80 : These YouTuber-beloved earbuds are actually a decent cheap pair . They are small and light, and they come with an IPX6 rating, which makes them great for workouts. Master & Dynamic MW08 Sport for $399 : The Sport are a great option that come with active noise canceling and a striking design, but the high price keeps them out of the reach of most people. Earbuds to Avoid As a general rule, you should avoid earbuds that don't support the Bluetooth 5.0 standard (or higher) or don't offer at least five hours of battery life, and more like six these days. Batteries in wireless headphones degrade over time, so the better your battery life is at first, the more tolerable it will be in two to three years. Apple AirPods (Previous or Current Gen) for $119-$170 : These headphones do some things well, we just don't like them all that much. ( Read our latest review. ) They get OK battery life, come in a compact case, and work well for calls, but they don't fit all ears well, and since they don't have ear tips or wings, you're out of luck if they're loose. The priciest model adds noise canceling which works about as well as you'd expect for a pair that doesn't offer a proper seal. Want clear music, good noise canceling, and advanced features made for iPhones for less than the AirPods Pro 3? Get the AirPods Pro Gen 2 , which sometimes cost more (and sometimes less) but are legitimately great. Beats Solo Buds for $70 : These are lackluster in virtually every possible way , especially when it comes to features for the money. Their best traits are their micro-size and big battery, but that's about it. It's odd, because we like other headphones from the brand, but these just don't keep pace. The best we can say is they are cheap. Samsung Galaxy Buds 3 for $155 : A Cybertrucked pair of AirPods clones , the headphones in the new Galaxy Buds line work worse than they already look. With no eartips, these are uncomfortable to wear for long periods, and the noise canceling is all but useless. How We Define Wireless Earbuds AccordionItemContainerButton We've seen this category go by many names: true wireless earbuds, truly wireless earbuds, completely wireless earbuds, fully wireless earbuds, wirefree earbuds, etc . These days, if a pair of earbuds connects to your phone/computer via Bluetooth and has no cord that connects the left bud to the right, we just call them wireless. Wireless sets typically come with two popcorn-sized buds, each with a battery inside, and a charging cradle that carries extra battery power and keeps them safe when you're not wearing ’em. Some wireless earbuds have a cable or neckband that connects the two buds together, usually found on workout buds from brands like Shokz. Ridding yourself of all cords can feel liberating, but these do come with issues, such as limited battery life (don't buy any with less than five hours), confusing controls, and reliance on a charging case. They're also easier to lose than traditional earbuds, and replacing one bud can be expensive. That said, this is one of the most innovative categories in tech, offering a flurry of new features from heart rate monitors to OTC hearing aid functionality , with more added in each new generation. These days features like noise canceling and transparency mode are standard, while the burgeoning open-ear category offers a more natural way to keep aware of your surrounding.

d1d9582c465c,Review: DJI Mini 5 Pro,"shopping, reviews, review, drones, dji, cameras, outdoors","I enquired about the weight, and a DJI spokesperson sent me the following statement: “The DJI Mini 5 Pro has a design weight of 249.9 grams. Due to manufacturing tolerances, the actual weight of the product may vary slightly within a range of ±4 g. Minor weight fluctuations are normal. We recommend that when UK users are operating the drone, local regulations are complied with, which can be found here .” The company refers to it as a “near-250g drone”—terminology I'd never encountered from DJI. Frankly, it feels a little evasive. This isn't just pedantic nitpicking over a few grams. I live in the UK, and the 250-gram threshold determines whether you can fly a drone in public parks, on beaches, in towns and cities, near people, and in countless other scenarios without additional certification. Previous Mini models have been just under this limit, and it seems like an oversight during the design process to not keep this one comfortably below it, too. There's good news, though: With UK drone rules set to change at the beginning of 2026, I don't have too long to wait until the Mini 5 Pro (and, interestingly, the much bigger DJI Air 3S ) becomes completely legal to fly in built-up areas, public parks, and close to people. The tidings for US-based pilots aren't so cheery, though. As with all of its recent products, DJI isn't officially launching the Mini 5 Pro in the US. You can blame the impending DJI ban , and it's a real shame, because, weight issues aside, this is a fantastic camera drone. Big Camera Upgrades Photograph: Sam Kieldsen The Mini 5 Pro's slight weight increase comes with genuine benefits. The main improvement is the camera, which now features a 12-MP (or 50 MP in Quad Bayer terms) 1-inch sensor, a significant upgrade from the smaller sensors in previous Mini models. The image quality is edging towards DJI's Air range, which is remarkable for a drone this size.

247191f43da4,Review: HP EliteBook 6 G1q,"shopping, laptops, computers, windows, hp, windows pcs, reviews, review","Benchmark scores were unsurprising, turning in slightly above-average numbers across the board when compared to other Snapdragon X Plus laptops. Even its battery life of just over 17 hours when playing a full-screen video via YouTube (over Wi-Fi, not HP Go) is about in the middle of all Qualcomm-based systems I’ve encountered—though that’s admittedly still an excellent mark compared to all laptops. The industrial design is utilitarian, though just shy of being completely boring. The silver machine, crafted from partially recycled aluminum and plastic, has a look that feels dated, and at 24 mm thick and 3.2 pounds, it’s also very heavy for a 14-inch system. (It feels heavy in the hand and on the lap as well.) Props, however, for the textured surface on the keyboard caps, which makes for a more pleasant typing experience than most laptops provide—though note it does not offer any backlighting. The trackpad is spacious without being obtrusive in size. Port selection is also solid, including two USB-C ports with USB4 support, two USB-A ports, a full-size HDMI jack, and a drop-jaw Ethernet port. The SIM card slot is also accessible from the side of the device; users can bring their own data plan if they don’t want to use the multicarrier HP Go, which works via eSIM . Poor Value Photograph: Chris Null The G1q is a Copilot+ PC and, as with more general workloads, it turned in perfectly acceptable scores on AI-based jobs like image generation and computer vision tests. It’s plenty stable in daily use; in fact, the only trouble I encountered was during initial setup, when it lost its internet connection midway and forced me to start over from scratch—annoying, but a one-time problem that never cropped up again.",https://www.wired.com/review/hp-elitebook-6-g1q,Technology,BBC,Christopher Null,"https://media.wired.com/photos/68eda149d38069fa305c069b/191:100/w_1280,c_limit/Review-%20HP%20EliteBook%206%20G1q.png",2025-10-14T08:00:00-04:00,d809f1f5910fb6bc71647937fd6276b82cb551ea
3a8795848753,The Best VPNs for iPhone,"shopping, iphone, ios, apple, vpn, buying guides, phones, smartphones","Other iPhone VPNs We Tested Surfshark : Surfshark was a strong contender for the main list. Even its Starter plan comes with extra features like a masked email generator. Features like ad and tracker blocking, as well as unlimited simultaneous connections, come standard across plans. However, it was a bit slower than my top picks, dropping around 20 percent of speed on average, compared to around 15 percent for the top options. Mullvad : Mullvad is a favorite among privacy enthusiasts, and for good reason. It doesn’t fuss with multi-year discounts or referral programs, and you don’t even need to provide an email to sign up for an account. You can even pay the static monthly fee by mailing Mullvad cash. It’s a great service if privacy is your top priority, but it trades speeds and features in the process. VPN services like Nord and Proton have quickly grown into full privacy and security suites, while Mullvad is more focused on making a robust VPN. In the context of an iPhone, the scales tip more toward those security suites, but Mullvad is still a great privacy-focused option to keep in mind. ExpressVPN : By the numbers, ExpressVPN should be at the top of the list. It has a ton of servers, a featureset that can go toe-to-toe with Nord, and speeds only a touch below Proton. However, ExpressVPN has found itself in a spiral of increasing controversies over the past four years, and the brand has yet to get back on solid footing. After being purchased by Kape Technologies—the company behind the infamous adware company Crossrider—former US intelligence official Daniel Gericke took over at CTO and continued in that role for two years, even after being fined over $300,000 by the US Department of Justice for hacking activities on behalf of a foreign government. Gericke left in 2023, but that same year, ExpressVPN experienced a large swath of layoffs, and Kape, its parent company, was delisted from the London Stock Exchange. The vast majority of shares went to Unikmind Holdings Limited, a company owned by Israeli billionaire Teddy Sagi, who got his start by creating gambling software Playtech. That’s an extremely condensed version of what ExpressVPN has gone through over the past few years. The company hasn’t done anything nefarious, but the revolving door of executive control tied to controversial names doesn’t inspire confidence. Private Internet Access : Private Internet Access, or PIA, is also owned by Kape Technologies, and it followed a similar playbook as ExpressVPN and CyberGhost, which Kape also owns. After the acquisition and community backlash, there’s been very little transparency about what’s going on in the company. A connection to Kape definitely raises questions, but that doesn’t immediately disqualify a service from being included. Unfortunately for PIA, it had much slower speeds than any of the other VPN services I tested, so regardless of ownership, it isn’t a top pick for iPhone VPNs. iPhone VPN Feature Comparison You might be surprised how similar the three VPNs I chose are when you break down their features, but that’s not an accident. Given how restrictive I was with who made the final cut, there’s a pretty high bar for inclusion. Although there are some minor differences, I designed this list in a way that you can choose one of my picks without reading a single word and still come out the other side with an excellent VPN for iPhone. How We Tested To earn the best iPhone VPN title, a service needs to satisfy three criteria. It needs to be secure, fast, and easy to use. That may seem straightforward enough, but there’s a little more that goes into it. For ease of use, I only looked at VPNs that offer a one-tap connection. If you need to configure anything, that’s a disqualification. That still encompasses a lot of the most popular VPNs on iPhone, so I narrowed the field further by focusing on apps that balance usability with power. You should have all the relevant features in the iOS app that are available in the desktop app, and organized in a way that they don’t disrupt that one-tap experience. Speed testing is where I focused a lot of my testing time. Speed testing is highly variable, and trying to come out with one singular number to encompass the speed of thousands of servers is a fool’s errand. The numbers I gathered for this guide are the result of 20 tests I ran for each VPN, then averaged. I tested five locations for each VPN, measuring my unprotected speed immediately before testing and running three passes before averaging. Each location was tested at a different time of day, and I removed any outliers before averaging. For this guide, that meant if there was greater than a 10 percent deviation between two of the three passes. After averaging the speed drop for each location, I gathered all of those numbers together and averaged them for a final speed drop. Finally, security. The traditional wisdom with a VPN is that you, at some point, have to put some faith in the company that its privacy policy is accurate and it isn’t lying about its logging practices. That didn’t do it for me. Again, I set a high bar for inclusion. Every VPN I’ve included here has not only been independently audited, but also been forced to uphold its no-logs policy in legal proceedings. You indeed need to put some trust that the VPN provider you’re using is telling the truth, but the options I included all have rock-solid track records when it comes to transparency.

4257a39666f8,Review: Google Pixel Buds 2a,"google, bluetooth, headphones, earbuds, wireless earbuds, reviews, review, shopping, pixel","As usual, I love the matte white case that comes with these buds; it feels less sticky than the shiny cases from Apple and others, and it makes it slide into pants pockets like a puck on ice. One thing the case doesn't come with is wireless charging; you'll have to stick to USB-C. Battery life is a pleasant seven hours, with a replaceable (!) battery in the case, combining for 20 hours with active noise canceling on and 27 with it off. I like the slimmer profile of the new buds, but I have to admit I didn't notice much of a difference in fit in my average-size ears. Google's app immediately asked me to do a fit test when I paired the headphones with my Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra , and the already-installed medium eartips fit perfectly in my ears. If you have a Pixel phone , you won't even need to install the Pixel Buds app, as it comes preinstalled. App-based features allow you to adjust everything from EQ settings to what the buttons do on each side of the earbuds. It's all simple and intuitive, essentially identical to the experience Apple users have with AirPods, just on a different ecosystem. Touch controls on the outside of each bud are simple. I made one side of the buds call up the Gemini assistant, and the other work for playing and pausing tunes. One oddity is that there isn't a way to adjust volume on the buds themselves; you'll have to press the side buttons on your phone or the volume slider on your laptop to change volume. Depending on how much you like to adjust volume on the fly, this can either be a mild annoyance or a total deal-breaker. I personally find myself using my phone most of the time anyway, so it was merely a quirk. Great Sound Photograph: Parker Hall The Pixel Buds Pro 2 have long been some of my favorite headphones to take with me, thanks to the pebble-y charging case and excellent sound quality. The Buds 2a fit those much more expensive shoes quite well, with similar prowess in the bass and treble, especially.

AI. How would you alter it? I would make it more democratic. I would just open up as much of it as I could, because the race is so fast and so expensive. You're buying and you're buying all the technology that you can. You're inventing all the technology you can, and it's almost immediately out of date. When you're in that environment, you have to worry about what you're doing yourself, which is why you see Meta trying to pay all these in insane bonuses to get the best. It’s wild. As long as you've got the best talent and you've got somebody with great ideas, as long as you've got your own Jony Ive, using an Apple analogy, you can be more open. You don't have to be afraid. You don't have to hold back. So you want to see AI development move even faster than it already is? Yes, it has to because China ain't waiting for nobody. What happens if China quote-unquote wins that race? We're fucked. First lemme take a step back. Winning, right? There's still a long way to go. AI still is effectively stupid. It doesn't have the intuition, it doesn't have the immediacy of a worldview that people have. So it's still dumb now. It still makes it smart at processes and the things we've talked about, but I don't see this big general threat in terms of a takeover in the next 20 years. To sum up, you want to alter AI so that the industry moves faster. We live in the Matrix, but all of the videos that my child is generating using Sora 2, you want me to have a copy? For sure. By the way, the best way to know what your kid is into is by looking at their Instagram and TikTok feed. That'll tell you more about your child. But in any event, that has more impact on everything that happens. And again, going back to politics, whoever controls the algorithm controls the world. With that in mind, how are we feeling about Larry Ellison today? To be determined. I won't jump to any conclusions. Let's see what happens. Because it could backfire. Just because you have control doesn't mean you win. There is certainly a risk. But risk not just to the output from the algorithms but risk to how he operates the company. And, you know Zuckerberg's gonna do all he can to fuck him up, and you know Elon's gonna do all he can to fuck him up. That's the true battle of the oligarchs right there.

ae467895a12d,"Satellites Are Leaking the World’s Secrets: Calls, Texts, Military and Corporate Data","surveillance, privacy, nsa, cybersecurity, security, satellites, t-mobile, at&t, walmart, military, military tech","That suggests anyone could set up similar hardware somewhere else in the world and likely obtain their own collection of sensitive information. After all, the researchers restricted their experiment to only off-the-shelf satellite hardware: a $185 satellite dish, a $140 roof mount with a $195 motor, and a $230 tuner card, totaling less than $800. “This was not NSA-level resources. This was DirecTV-user-level resources. The barrier to entry for this sort of attack is extremely low,” says Matt Blaze, a computer scientist and cryptographer at Georgetown University and law professor at Georgetown Law. “By the week after next, we will have hundreds or perhaps thousands of people, many of whom won’t tell us what they’re doing, replicating this work and seeing what they can find up there in the sky.” One of the only barriers to replicating their work, the researchers say, would likely be the hundreds of hours they spent on the roof adjusting their satellite. As for the in-depth, highly technical analysis of obscure data protocols they obtained, that may now be easier to replicate, too: The researchers are releasing their own open-source software tool for interpreting satellite data, also titled “Don’t Look Up,” on Github. The researchers’ work may, they acknowledge, enable others with less benevolent intentions to pull the same highly sensitive data from space. But they argue it will also push more of the owners of that satellite communications data to encrypt that data, to protect themselves and their customers. “As long as we’re on the side of finding things that are insecure and securing them, we feel very good about it,” says Schulman. There’s little doubt, they say, that intelligence agencies with vastly superior satellite receiver hardware have been analyzing the same unencrypted data for years. In fact, they point out that the US National Security Agency warned in a 2022 security advisory about the lack of encryption for satellite communications. At the same time, they assume that the NSA—and every other intelligence agency from Russia to China—has set up satellite dishes around the world to exploit that same lack of protection. (The NSA did not respond to WIRED’s request for comment). “If they aren't already doing this,” jokes UCSD cryptography professor Nadia Heninger, who co-led the study, “then where are my tax dollars going?” Heninger compares their study’s revelation—the sheer scale of the unprotected satellite data available for the taking—to some of the revelations of Edward Snowden that showed how the NSA and Britain’s GCHQ were obtaining telecom and internet data on an enormous scale, often by secretly tapping directly into communications infrastructure. “The threat model that everybody had in mind was that we need to be encrypting everything, because there are governments that are tapping undersea fiber optic cables or coercing telecom companies into letting them have access to the data,” Heninger says. “And now what we're seeing is, this same kind of data is just being broadcast to a large fraction of the planet.” Updated 1pm ET, October 14, 2025: Added additional information from T-Mobile about the encryption the company added to its cell network following the researchers' discoveries.",https://www.wired.com/story/satellites-are-leaking-the-worlds-secrets-calls-texts-military-and-corporate-data,Technology,BBC,Andy Greenberg,"https://media.wired.com/photos/68e961a8dc203222538eb046/191:100/w_1280,c_limit/security_satellites_leak_data.jpg",2025-10-14T01:00:00+00:00,3db767e698adeed072b6c6dbe9b2ccb15ea4402f
8009715800da,Our Favorite Computer Monitor Is $75 Off,"deals, shopping, pcs, monitors, dell","If you're tired of staring a tiny laptop screen while working from home, consider scooping up our favorite desktop monitor for almost 25 percent off its normal price. The Dell 27 Plus 4K (8/10, WIRED Reivew) is currently marked down to just $228 on Amazon , the lowest we've seen yet for this smart and practical 4K screen. Dell 27 Plus 4K Monitor (S2725QS) You might be worried about poor panel quality or scarce features, considering the price point, but the Dell S2725QS is surprisingly well equipped for under $300. It has an IPS panel, which is one of the better non-OLED options, with thin bezels and a minimal stand that will fit right into any desk setup. It has 100 percent sRGB coverage, and 79 percent AdobeRGB, with good color accuracy to match, making it a nice choice for light creative work as well. It also has a 120-Hz refresh rate, so while you may want to consider a dedicated screen for gaming, you can certainly jam some weekend Fortnite rounds. AMD FreeSync Premium will help keep things smooth, since reaching frame rates that high will be tough for most systems. You might find that even scrolling the web is much better with a higher refresh rate, though. I know I have trouble going back to 60 Hz. Although it's a little short on ports, lacking any USB in particular, it is VESA compatible if you want to mount it or put it on a stand. It has internal speakers too, and our reviewer, Luke Larsen, was impressed with how they stack up against most built-in monitor speakers. That's not too tough considering they can often be thin and tinny, but it's a nice benefit for anyone lacking the desk space for a nicer, dedicated option. Overall, the Dell 27 Plus 4K is an excellent value, which makes it easy to overlook some of the smaller inconveniences. If you want to spend more for something nicer, make sure to check out the full roundup of our favorite desktop monitors , but most people just looking for a second screen for their work laptop will be exceedingly happy with this Dell.",https://www.wired.com/story/dell-27-plus-deal-1025,Technology,BBC,Brad Bourque,"https://media.wired.com/photos/68ed359505c586ea21db5bed/191:100/w_1280,c_limit/Save%20Almost%20$75%20on%20our%20Favorite%20Computer%20Monitor.png",2025-10-13T20:35:08.255000+00:00,11b3edaa54ddfdb8c070ca4890fca641073be8c4
c3b78b6c379d,The Best Website Builders for Designing Your Own Site,"shopping, websites, buying guides, web design, how-to, design, software","Top Website Builders Best for Most People Squarespace Core Read More Best Cheap Website Builder Hostinger Website Builder Read More Best Free Website Builder Strikingly Website Builder Read More Publishing a website is still more complicated than it has any right to be, but the best website builders streamline the process. Instead of juggling a bunch of files on a server and learning the ins and outs of networking, website builders do exactly what's written on the tin. Piece by piece, using a drag-and-drop interface, you can design your website the way you want with immediate feedback, rather than spending time buried in code and hoping it comes out on the other end. There are dozens of website builders, and most of them range from decent to straight-up bad. Any web host with a bit of ambition has a website builder floating around, even if it's slow, clunky, and lacking features. I focused on finding the best tools for building your website that go beyond just an add-on, and these are my favorites. If you're after something simpler than a full-blown website, check out our list of the Best Portfolio Websites . Table of Contents AccordionItemContainerButton Best Website Builder for Most Squarespace via Jacob Roach You’ve heard of Squarespace over and over again, I’m sure, and that’s not an accident. It’s an inviting website builder that made a name for itself with bold, striking templates. Beneath the veneer of attractive, but seemingly simple, websites, you’ll find one of the most capable website builders on the market. That balance of power and usability is what sets Squarespace apart. It feels like a creative tool. Where other website builders lag and stutter to get a new element on your page, Squarespace feels fluid. Your dashboard gives you quick access to edit your site, and around every corner, Squarespace feels designed so you never have to look up a tutorial. I started a simple photography website, and within an hour, I had a custom course page set up, an appointment schedule with automated confirmation emails, and services (with pricing and the ability to accept payments) configured. Squarespace isn’t cheap, but it also doesn’t meddle in restrictive, low-cost plans. Even on the Basic plan, you have access to ecommerce tools and space for multiple contributors. Squarespace Pricing and Plans AccordionItemContainerButton Best Cheap Website Builder Hostinger via Jacob Roach Hostinger is better known as a web hosting provider, but it has a surprisingly robust website builder that you can use on its own or for free as part of a hosting package. You don’t get the same world-class template design and dense feature-set of a more expensive builder like Squarespace, but that’s OK. Hostinger’s website builder will run you just a few bucks a month, and based on my testing, it feels heavily angled toward newcomers. You sacrifice some power for convenience, but there’s an awful lot you can accomplish with Hostinger. Integrations with PayPal, Stripe, and Square allow you to quickly set up e-commerce. Add-ons with WhatsApp give you live chat capabilities, and Printful support means you can sell print-on-demand merchandise. And, if you outgrow the website builder, Hostinger allows you to export your website’s content to WordPress. Where Hostinger wins for me is through its AI tools. Just about every website builder these days has AI integrated in some way, but it’s around every corner at Hostinger. You need to pay extra for some of these AI features—the logo generator, for example, requires credits—but they give you a great starting point for mocking up the look, feel, and tone of your website. Hostinger Pricing and Plans AccordionItemContainerButton Best for Small Businesses Wix is undoubtedly the biggest competitor to Squarespace, and I had a hard time putting one above the other. Ultimately, Wix ended up in the backseat due to higher prices and a slightly less intuitive interface. That’s partly because of how powerful Wix is. Rather than corral you in an elegant (if restrictive) website-building workflow, Wix gives you a ton of options. First, templates. You get a few hundred elsewhere, but Wix offers over 2,000 templates. At the time of writing, there are 223 pages of them on Wix’s website. They aren’t all winners, but I was able to mock up a quick photography portfolio website within a few minutes by browsing the templates and uploading a few photos.",https://www.wired.com/story/best-website-builders,Technology,BBC,Jacob Roach,"https://media.wired.com/photos/68e80dcb34a4e22944e3d3d0/191:100/w_1280,c_limit/Squarespce-source-Squarespace.jpg",2025-10-12T14:00:00+00:00,c333008476e595d879befe631a2946ba3fcf8940
d4f78cb22d7f,Our Favorite Smart Displays for Controlling Your Home,"buying guides, shopping, alexa, google, assistant, smart home","Comparing Our Favorite Smart Displays More Smart Displays We Like Echo Hub for $180 : The Echo Hub isn't exactly a smart display. It lacks powerful speaker capabilities and doesn't have a camera for calls or Amazon's Drop-In video call feature. Instead, it focuses entirely on being a smart home dashboard with built-in Alexa, plus features like widgets and the photo frame. I think it takes the best, most easily used features of a smart display and cuts out the rest. But if you want a good speaker, don't choose this one. Echo Show 5 (3rd Gen, 2023) for $90 : The smaller and cheaper third-gen Echo Show 5 has a 5.5-inch screen that works best on a desk or a bedside table. We think it's a bit too small for the kitchen or living room, but that depends on how you plan to use it. Echo Show 15 for $300 : This is the largest of them all, with a 15.6-inch display, and it has customizable widgets so you can have smart-home device controls and calendar reminders available whenever. It's made to be mounted on your wall like a TV (a stand is sold separately), and the Show 15 pairs with a Fire TV remote (you can use the app) to use the streaming features. With the new Alexa+ I've found myself liking it a lot more, and it's much less distracting than the rotating slideshows you get on smaller Echo Shows. It's a splurge, though, and I still wish the streaming capabilities were better. Google Nest Hub for $100 : Google’s second-gen Nest Hub is a great option if you don't need a camera and don’t mind a smaller 7-inch screen. It has a wake-up alarm that emulates the rising sun for gentler mornings, though it's not bright enough to qualify as a sunrise alarm clock. It also has sleep-tracking tech to track your sleep quality, though the quality of the results isn't great. It also supports gestures—like playing or pausing a video with a hand movement —by using unique radar tech . Google Pixel Tablet for $499 : This tablet doubles as a smart speaker when placed on its speaker dock. It works well, but it's not currently slated to get Google's new assistant, Gemini for Home. If that changes, we'll go back to recommending it. But we're not sure it will: availability has been limited for the speaker base, and could point to this device being discontinued altogether. Smart Displays to Skip We don't like every smart display. Here are the ones we're skipping after trying them out. Echo Show 10 (3rd Gen, 2021) for $250 : This smart display is situated on top of a large cylindrical speaker, which makes it sound great. The screen physically swivels to follow you around the room as you use it, keeping you in frame while you video chat or keeping your streamed workout video in your line of sight as you move about. Because the screen moves around so much, you may have trouble positioning it in tighter spaces—especially in corners. It's a unique model, and is still out of stock like it was this summer. I suspect the upcoming new Echo Show 11 ($220) might replace it, since it has a similar design (but leaves out the movement gimmick). Third-Party Google Displays: Google is no longer updating software for some of the third-party smart displays we used to recommend in this guide. If you have one, it will still work, but some features will likely suffer or disappear entirely as time passes. This seems to be the fate of most third-party Google smart displays, which is why we don't recommend them anymore. Google did say they'll be working with partners to bring Gemini for Home to third-party devices, so we'll see how that pans out. What About Alexa+ and the New Echo Shows? Amazon has been randomly rolling out its new version of Alexa, named Alexa+ , in early access since the spring. This second generation of the Alexa voice assistant is more conversational, able to execute complex tasks and learn new information, and can be much more personalized. That'll be due to its being powered by generative AI. Check out our hands-on with early access Alexa+ for more more about our experience. Unlike the current Alexa, once it's fully available, it'll cost $20 a month or be free if you have an Amazon Prime membership. This is a big jump from the free assistant, but you can keep the current Alexa for free if you don't wish for another subscription or have an Amazon Prime membership. Right now, it's also only available in early access for Echo Show devices. You can sign up here for the wait list. Alexa+ will be immediately available on its newest devices coming this fall, however. There will be two new smart displays, the Echo Show 8 (4th Gen) and Echo Show 11 , and two new smart speakers, the Echo Dot Max and Echo Studio (2nd Gen) . We're curious how the new models will compare to our current favorites, and we will update this guide once we test them. It's also important to note that Alexa+ has forced a privacy change for all Echo devices. Echo devices used to be able to process voice recordings locally on your device, but the “Do Not Send Voice Recordings” privacy feature was killed in March. Now all voice recordings will be sent to Amazon to be processed in order to make Alexa+ function, but even if you don't end up using Alexa+, the feature is gone. What About Gemini for Home and Google’s Smart Displays? Amazon isn't the only one rolling out a new version of its assistant. Gemini for Home is Google's similarly AI-powered smart assistant that will replace Google Assistant in just about all of its available speakers. Unlike Amazon's new assistant, Gemini for Home will be free, but Google is changing its Nest Aware subscription to become a subscription that's both for video storage and for more powerful assistant features. Google is also rolling out a new speaker in the spring, but no new smart display is slated yet. The new assistant will come to all of Google's existing lineup except for the Google Pixel Tablet, which we no longer recommend since it's not currently planned to get support with the new assistant. Google did say they plan to work with third-party partners to bring Gemini for Home to more devices, so we might see new third-party displays that we can recommend again. We'll update this guide as we learn more, but for now, Google's Nest Hub Max and Nest Hub are the best smart displays to purchase if you want access to Google's new assistant. FAQs Do You Need a Smart Display? AccordionItemContainerButton Smart displays are helpful, acting as hubs for your smart home devices, walking you through recipes while you chop away in the kitchen, and in some cases allowing you to video chat hands-free too. But we're not sure how long they'll be worth it, or even exist, in their current form. Companies have been experimenting and doing away with smart displays again and again; Meta discontinued its Portal devices, Google might be discontinuing the Pixel Tablet we favored, and Apple still has yet to even make a smart display. Amazon has continued to make new smart displays, even after losing $10 billion in 2022 thanks to failures around the Alexa voice assistant. The Alexa team was reportedly hit hard by layoffs in 2022 and 2023, but new smart displays continued to come out since then and more are slated to come out later this fall: the Echo Show 8 (4th Gen) and Echo Show 11. The future of these smart home devices isn't clear right now , but if you're going to get one, we suggest sticking with devices directly from the brand whose voice assistant you prefer. Otherwise, consider one of our favorite tablets instead. Does Apple Have a Smart Display? AccordionItemContainerButton So far, Apple has yet to launch its own dedicated smart display. Apple iPhones have a StandBy Mode included in iOS that activates when an iPhone is on its side and charging, using stands like this one from Twelve South . I had hoped this feature would feel similar to a smart display , but StandBy Mode is limited to customizable clock faces, showing your photos, and having your texts pop up in large text that fills the screen. It doesn't scratch the itch of all the features you get in a smart display and instead feels like a fancy alarm clock . What About Digital Calendars? AccordionItemContainerButton There’s a growing market of digital calendars that look a bit like smart displays, but instead of being able to respond to voice commands and stream a video call, these digital screens are designed to have one shared calendar for the entire family to see and view. Skylight, a maker of one of our favorite digital photo frames, makes the Skylight Calendar (starting at $170) that comes in 10 inches, 15 inches, and 27 inches, while I tested the Hearth Display ($699) that comes exclusively in a 27-inch size. Cozyla also makes the Cozyla Calendar+ that starts at 15 inches but goes all the way up to a 36-inch screen. There are some differences in these calendars, but you'll find a similar roadblock to them: memberships. Hearth Display encourages using the display to create routines with your family, specifically kids, though you'll want a kid older than my 2-year-old to use it properly (though the Hearth does have icons designed for kids who can't read yet), and to sign up for the Family Membership. The Skylight touts a photo screensaver and meal planning tools if you sign up for the monthly Plus Plan. You could find these devices are for you, but it's either another device for one parent to manage or something you'll have to teach your entire family to make into a habit to really get the most out of. You're likely better off just teaching everyone in your family to share their Google Calendar. Power up with unlimited access to WIRED .

f2cb84fb4907,Windows 10 Is Dead. Upgrade to One of These Great Windows 11 Laptops,"laptops, shopping, windows, computers, microsoft, dell, lenovo, windows pcs, buying guides","You'll want to read our extensive guide on How to Choose the Right Laptop , but for the basics, you'll want to decide what category of laptop you need. Most people should buy a 13-inch or 14-inch laptop, and spending around $750-$1,000 is a good place to start. You should expect a laptop around this price to get good battery life, have a decent screen, perform well enough for basic tasks, and have a comfortable keyboard and touchpad. You should also expect at least 16 GB of RAM and 512 GB of storage. Anything more than that gets into premium territory where you're paying for higher specs, more performance, or extra features. If you want something with a discrete GPU for either gaming or creative workflows, you'll need to spend more than this. A laptop like the Dell 14 Plus is the ideal example of what you can get while shopping in this price range. You can even find laptops with OLED panels, up to one terabyte of storage, depending on how good discounts happen to be. I would consider anything under $750 to be a cheap laptop , and will therefore come with some significant compromises, especially around the quality of the panel and the touchpad. Fortunately, laptops that use the  Qualcomm Snapdragon X chip get great battery life, despite often falling under $750 in price. Here's a list of important specs to consider: CPU: For thin and light laptops, I would recommend one of the Snapdragon X, X Plus, or X Elite chips. They get the best battery life and performance for their class of laptop. As an alternative, the Intel Core Ultra 7 258V is also quite good. GPU: As of now, the Intel's Lunar Lake chips, such as the Core Ultra 7 258V, have the best integrated graphics. For discrete options, you'll want to pick something with one of the latest Nvidia RTX 50-series GPUs, such as the RTX 5060. The biggest leap in performance there is between the RTX 5070 and the RTX 5070 Ti, which increases VRAM to 12 GB. RAM (or memory): Stick with at least 16 GB if you can. Since the advent of the Copilot+ designation, it ha become the new standard. You'll even find laptops as cheap as $600 that have 16 GB of memory. Gamers and content creators should upgrade to 32 GB if possible. Storage: Similar to memory, many laptops have moved to 512 GB as the new standard, and you'll find lots of affordable laptops with 512 GB as the base configuration. Upgrading to one or two terabytes, where possible, will make your life that much easier, especially since many laptops don't offer expandable storage. Display: Laptops are usually categorized by screen size, with 13-inch, 14-inch, and 16-inch being the most common. You'll want to consider size, resolution, refresh rate , and panel type here. Portability: Outside of display size, thickness of the chassis and weight are the primary factors here, determining how portable a laptop is to travel with. Other dimensions are important too, but more often than not, that is determined by the screen size. Ports: Many laptops are limited to just USB-C and headphone jack these days, with some exceptions where USB-A or HDMI are included. Make sure your laptop has what you need, or else you'll need a USB Hub or laptop docking station to get more ports or to increase external display support.",https://www.wired.com/gallery/best-windows-laptops,Technology,BBC,Luke Larsen,"https://media.wired.com/photos/68e972a9adf8b328300b90b3/191:100/w_1280,c_limit/Windows%2010%20Is%20Dead.%20Upgrade%20to%20One%20of%20These%20Great%20Windows%2011%20Laptops.png",2025-10-13T12:00:00+00:00,115f99c504571b96332341be5c52b0a74567deef
4d8b46b6b44a,"Programming in Assembly Is Brutal, Beautiful, and Maybe Even a Path to Better AI","machine readable, coding, programming, computers, software","Rollercoaster Tycoon wasn’t the most fashionable computer game out there in 1999. But if you took a look beneath the pixels—the rickety rides, the crowds of hungry, thirsty, barfing people (and the janitors mopping in their wake)—deep down at the level of the code , you saw craftsmanship so obsessive that it bordered on insane. Chris Sawyer, the game’s sole developer, wrote the whole thing in assembly. Certain programming languages, like Python or Go or C++, are called “high-level” because they work sort of like human language, written in commands and idioms that might fit in at a poetry slam. Generally speaking, a piece of software like a compiler transforms this into what the machine really reads: blocks of 1s and 0s (or maybe hex) that tell actual transistors how to behave. Assembly, the lowest of the “low-level” languages, has a near one-to-one correspondence with the machine’s native tongue. It’s coding straight to metal. To build a complex computer game from assembly is like weaving a tapestry from shedded cat fur. Why would anyone do this? I recently asked Sawyer, who lives in his native Scotland. He told me that efficiency was one reason. In the 1990s, the tools for high-level programming weren’t all there. Compilers were terribly slow. Debuggers sucked. Sawyer could avoid them by doing his own thing in x86 assembly, the lingua franca of Intel chips. We both knew that wasn’t the real reason, though. The real reason was love. Before turning to roller coasters, Sawyer had written another game in assembly, Transport Tycoon . It puts players in charge of a city’s roads, rail stations, runways, and ports. I imagined Sawyer as a model-train hobbyist—laying each stretch of track, hand-sewing artificial turf, each detail a choice and a chore. To move these carefully crafted pixels from bitmaps to display, Sawyer had to coax out the chip’s full potential. “ RollerCoaster Tycoon only came about because I was familiar with the limits of what was possible,” he told me. Working within the limits? A foreign idea, perhaps, in this age of digital abundance, when calling a single function in an AI training algorithm can engage a million GPUs. With assembly, you get one thing and one thing only, and it is the thing you ask for—even, as many a coder has learned the hard way, if it is wrong. Assembly is brutal and beautiful that way. It requires you to say exactly what you mean. I’ve done assembly’s creators a disservice. They wanted things to be easier, not harder. I imagine they were tired of loading up punchcards and flipping switches on their steampunk leviathans. Perhaps they dreamed of a world like ours, where computers can do so much with such minimal guidance.",https://www.wired.com/story/programming-assembly-artificial-intelligence,Technology,BBC,Gregory Barber,"https://media.wired.com/photos/68e6c45f693f7ce213ae491f/191:100/w_1280,c_limit/MR%20011%20'Assembly%20Codes'.jpg",2025-10-13T11:00:00+00:00,58163628e49b9ee6948c5670e321f73418678b7b
73c3efd70e75,How to Make STEM Funny—and Go Viral Doing It,"stem, comedy","Wait, I saw this. You posted a video of someone in the crowd telling you they were a veterinarian and then you said “ OK, some of this might not be right … ” and then that got a laugh. Yeah, definitely. I normally start shows by saying I have a degree in chemistry, and then asking who else does. If there's anyone in there that has a degree in chemistry of a higher level or from a better university, I'm cooked. What's the worst heckle you've ever gotten? I did a work in progress show last Sunday, and I was doing a joke about exothermic reactions. This is the joke where you ask if the audience wants to hear about exothermic reactions and then say you don’t have the energy . Yeah, and in my head, I swear it's right. But I just hear a little voice that goes, “Actually, I think if you change that to activation energy , it will work much better.” OK, fair, but yours also works, so … I do one joke where I draw a line of best fit . In Edinburgh, I drew it as a straight linear line of best fit and then after the laughter died someone piped up and was like, “Actually, it’s an exponential curve of best fit .” What’s worse is that I’ve done that joke many times and it wasn’t until someone said that that everyone in the audience was like “Yeah, they’re right.” It’s like oh no, I’ve done this joke 20 times … Do you think of your sets as educational? Or at least informative? Maybe a bit. But I'd probably put that energy to other things. Like I'm currently writing a book about the periodic table, and it's like a young adult kids’ book. So it's ages 10 to 15. That is actually genuinely educational where I've divided the book into groups of the periodic table, and then each group is related to their characteristics and their properties as an element, and then I sort of fictionalized them into personalities that match those properties. So that is educational.

7ac2851a2dcc,New Rules Could Force Tesla to Redesign Its Door Handles. That’s Harder Than It Sounds,"electric vehicles, tesla, cars, automobiles, evs and hybrids, manufacturing","The issues could cascade beyond the design. The auto manufacturing industry operates on strict production schedules. Though it builds in time to validate and test whatever new features come in each new model, the sudden intro of a design change late in the process could throw off the delicate timetable. In this decade, China’s auto industry has shocked the world by racing ahead of legacy automakers, quickly developing, with government support, ever newer, cheaper, and more technologically advanced vehicles on shorter production schedules. The country is the world’s largest automotive market; it’s expected to manufacture a full third of the world’s cars by 2030 . Still, quickly complying with new design regulations won’t be easy for domestic Chinese automakers either, says Broglin-Peterson. “Mechncial release requires a mechanical assembly,” she says. “It’s not just, you write some code.” Automaker’s door handle trouble likely won’t end in China. The new rules could lead to cascading responses from other global regulators. It’s a now-familiar pattern: China, once a place with lax protections, has forged ahead of the rest of the world in setting guidelines for electric vehicle battery safety and recycling, and autonomous vehicle tech. “This is a classic example of China setting the guardrails early: protecting consumers while quietly shaping global design standards,” Bill Russo, the CEO of Automobility, a Shanghai-based advisory firm, wrote in an email. A Handle on Design For many years, says Raphael Zammit, the chair of the transportation design department at the College for Creative Studies in Detroit, flush electronic door handles were the stuff of futuristic concept cars. “The fact that Elon Musk and Tesla put it into production was, frankly, pretty amazing,” he says. Their rise was linked with the increasing popularity of electric vehicles; tucking door handles into the doors of cars was meant to reduce their drag coefficient, leading to increased battery efficiency. Or so the theory went: Back-of-the-envelope math suggests the tweak maybe adds a mile of range. Maybe. Either way, the handles became a “demarcation of luxury,” Zammit says. Indeed, electronic door handles can be found on many luxury vehicles, including some made by Volkswagen, General Motors, Ford, and Mercedes-Benz. Jake Fisher, the senior director of the Consumer Reports’ Auto Test Center, tested several of those vehicles’ electronic handles . While all had emergency mechanical releases, as the Chinese regulations mandate, some were in places that could be difficult to find in an emergency—on the floor, in shadow, or, as in the rear seats of the 2021 Model Y under investigation by NHTSA, under a slot at the bottom of the rear door pocket. The best emergency mechanical releases, Consumer Reports found, were those that simply needed to be pulled a bit harder than usual to open, an intuitive reaction in an emergency.",https://www.wired.com/story/new-rules-could-force-tesla-to-redesign-its-door-handles-thats-harder-than-it-sounds,Technology,BBC,Aarian Marshall,"https://media.wired.com/photos/68e4035668d91f2b22fd4f9c/191:100/w_1280,c_limit/gear-telsa-door-handle-shutterstock_2679655353.jpg",2025-10-13T10:00:00+00:00,ece54b04d8299110dbbf3526e9ea860a90bd8775
a065ebddcb86,The ‘Womanosphere’ Is Reshaping the Conservative Dating Landscape,"social media, politics, sex, dating apps, donald trump, influencers, content creators","But even as conservatives are reclaiming the debate around modern dating, coasting on the momentum of Trump 2.0, there are noticeable fractures and hypocrisies in their approaches. On the podcast Culture Apothecary, Turning Point USA’s Alex Clark educates women about optimal fertility health and well-being. In an episode of Relatable titled “Be a Godly Woman, Not Just a Trad Wife,” host Allie Beth Stuckey discusses the appropriation of the trad wife trend, saying it “can be a great thing to aspire to” but Christian motherhood is “not just an aesthetic.” More recently, in response to polycule family structures, Stuckey noted that “the sexual revolution is reaching new lows.” Much of what the women discuss—on marriage, faith, and the importance of childbearing—dovetails with the agenda of the Trump administration. On social media, however, where Lacey has more than 1 million followers between TikTok and Instagram, she often straddles her conservatism with a wink and a smile. In one video , Lacey jokes about the consequences of not performing oral sex on your partner. In the next , she’s prancing through a green meadow declaring love for “my bible,” sundresses, and conservative men. Still, as the womanosphere grows louder, its influence is creating a less stigmatized environment for singles who no longer feel the shame of their values. “Of course that trickles down into the dating scene as well,” says right-wing influencer Debra Lea of the cultural shift, who adds that the “the popularity of monogamy, marriage, and starting a family is growing far beyond just the conservative movement.” Though she hasn’t prioritized finding a partner, Lea, 25, has dated a range of conservative men over the last few years. In the post-Biden era of young romance, she’s noticed a key difference; “politics seem to be more commonly discussed both on and before dates.” The hardcore moderates always “bring out my ultraconservative side,” she says. “I would never marry or seriously date somebody unaligned with me politically, but I believe there are many more important factors to align on, such as religion, healthy lifestyle, and hobbies.”",https://www.wired.com/story/the-womanosphere-is-reshaping-the-conservative-dating-landscape,Technology,BBC,Jason Parham,"https://media.wired.com/photos/68d5b99da0b397cb2d09d6e2/191:100/w_1280,c_limit/Conservative-OnlyFans-Star-Anya-Lacey-Tradwife-Dating-Site-Culture-IMG_4355.jpg",2025-10-13T09:30:00+00:00,2dcd333cfe4ec7ef7b3a2714748c0a02fa106437
f061c8e5dfa8,More Evidence Emerges That One of Saturn’s Moons Could Harbor Life,"science, space, saturn, extraterrestrial life","A recent study of Enceladus, one of Saturn’s moons, has detected several organic compounds that had never been recorded there before. The findings, published this month in Nature Astronomy , provide new clues about the interior chemical composition of this icy world, as well as new hope that it could harbor life. The researchers analyzed data from the Cassini probe, which launched in 1997 and studied Saturn and its moons for years until its destruction in 2017. For Enceladus, Cassini gathered data from ice fragments forcefully ejected from the moon’s subsurface ocean up into space. Enceladus is one of 274 bodies so far discovered in Saturn’s gravitational pull. It measures about 500 kilometers in diameter, making it the planet’s sixth-largest satellite. While this moon does not stand out for its size, it is notable for its cryovolcanoes—geysers at Enceladus’s south pole that spew out water vapor and ice fragments. Plumes of ejected material can extend to nearly 10,000 kilometers in length , which is more than the distance from Mexico to Patagonia, and some of this material rises into space. The outermost of Saturn’s main rings—its E ring—is primarily made up of ice ejected into space by Enceladus. This material is believed to come from a saline water chamber beneath the moon’s icy crust that is connected to its rocky core. It’s possible that chemical reactions are taking place down there, under high pressure and heat. Until now, most chemical analyses of ice from Enceladus were of particles deposited in Saturn’s E ring. But during a high-speed flyby of the moon in 2008, Cassini was fortunate enough to directly sample freshly ejected fragments from a cryovolcano. The new research paper reanalyzed this data, confirming the presence of previously detected organic molecules, as well as revealing compounds that had previously been undetected. “Such compounds are believed to be intermediates in the synthesis of more complex molecules, which could be potentially biologically relevant. It is important to note, however, that these molecules can be formed abiotically as well,” Nozair Khawaja, a planetary scientist at Freie Universität Berlin and lead author of the study, told Reuters . The discovery significantly expands the range of confirmed organic molecules on Enceladus. The key is that the compounds appeared in freshly ejected particles, suggesting that they were formed within the moon’s hidden ocean or in contact with its internal interfaces, not during their journey through the E ring or via exposure to the conditions of space. This reinforces the hypothesis that hydrothermal processes beneath Enceladus’s surface could be generating rich organic chemistry. Combining this new research with previous studies, scientists have now found five of the six elements essential for life—carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus, and sulfur—in the satellite’s ejected material. This itself is not a discovery of life, nor of biosignatures—the signs of life. However, the research confirms that Enceladus has the three basic conditions for life to form: liquid water, an energy source, and essential elements and organics. “Enceladus is, and should be ranked, as the prime target to explore habitability and search whether there is life or not,” Khawaja said.

45eb42ddc97d,The Best Cat Water Fountains,"shopping, animals, buying guides, animal behavior, smart home, cats, pets","Compare Our Picks Others We Tested Courtesy of Petkik Petkit Eversweet Max for $90 : This techy automatic fountain can be either cordless or battery-powered (lasting up to 83 days), and the drinking bowl is made of stainless steel, but the reservoir is plastic. Because of the shape of the basin with the chunky battery and reservoir bowl, it’s a little awkward to clean. The app logs every time a pet drinks and compares it over time to determine whether your cat’s drinking habits have changed. The app also keeps track of when the filter needs replacing and when you last added water. However, it doesn’t monitor or show you how much water is left in the basin; you have to check manually. The design also made it a bit difficult to clean and refill easily. Enabot Rola Smart Pet Water Fountain for $50 : This automatic fountain is cordless and runs on a rechargeable battery that lasts up to 60 days (although it can stay plugged in too). It has a wireless pump that uses magnetic induction—this pump was one of the easiest and most hassle-free to clean of all I tested. The fountain has a stainless steel top that holds a decent amount of water even when not running. Although the tank is plastic, and I’m wary of plastic now because of its propensity to harbor bacteria (plus it doesn't keep water as cold). The app gives reminders of when the water’s low, the fountain needs cleaning, or the filter needs replacing, plus it automatically stops dispensing water and sends you a reminder to refill via app. It also logs the number of times your pet drank and for how long, monitoring hydration patterns over time and comparing the stats to average time used. A complaint I had is that this fountain wouldn’t stay on Continuous stream mode, even when plugged in, instead automatically switching to the Sensing stream. Homerunpet Wireless Pet Fountain for $60 : This cordless fountain can be used as a traditional fountain plugged in on its base, or can be detached and moved around the house with 30 days of battery life. I don't love that this fountain is all plastic, but it's easy to see water levels from the outside, the top and filter layers are super easy to remove, clean, and replace, and the wireless (basically silent) pump makes it a whole lot easier to clean. Plastic doesn't keep the water as cold or clean as stainless steel, so you'll have to clean it a lot more often. The fountain only begins bubbling when a cat (or human) approaches to save battery power, and there's no option to control the flow (and no connected app). I like the wireless pump, but I'm really over plastic at this point. Photograph: Kat Merck Wonder Creature Cat Fountain for $20 : My two cats have cycled through several water fountains over the past few years, but this no-nonsense version has been a stalwart. The inside is lit by a blue LED (bright enough to glow in the dark), and a clear viewing window on the side makes it easy to monitor the water level from afar. I also like the dishwasher-safe metal bowl and the fact you can remove parts of the yellow and white “flower” to create a fountain configuration your cat likes (waterfall, low bubble-up, tall bubble-up). The only major downsides are the fact it requires very frequent cleaning and filter changes due to the plastic body, and that there is no reservoir to hold water in case of power outage or pump malfunction. When I go on vacation I have to swap it out for an old-school gravity dispenser . — Kat Merck Happy & Polly Gothic Cat Drinking Fountain for $60 : If you prefer gothic decor to neutral blandness, this ghostly ceramic cat fountain from Happy & Polly may tempt you to bite. The water bubbles up out of the top of the ghost and pools on the ceramic top. It’s fairly quiet at around 35 decibels, but it gets loud when the water is running low, and I worry about the motor burning out, as the 1.5-liter capacity can run dry fast. While the ceramic finish is easy to clean, it is fiddly to take apart. You will want to clean it once a week to prevent it from becoming slimy, and you must change the filter once a month. — Simon Hill Petkit Eversweet Solo 2 for $45 : I love three key features of this fountain: The bowl sits on top of a wireless charging base, so you don’t have to fiddle with cables, it is super easy to clean, and it's very quiet at around 25 decibels. A flashing light warns you when the water is running low, and you can check when the filter needs to be changed in the app. There’s an optional smart mode that pumps intermittently and a night mode to turn the light off. Pleasingly, all three of our cats drink from this fountain, though that does mean I have to refill it often, as it only holds 2 liters. — Simon Hill Photograph: Simon Hill Oneisall Stainless Steel Pet Fountain for $50 : This drinking fountain is about as simple as they come. As it's designed for cats or small dogs, it has a large bowl, but some cats will prefer that. I love the mostly stainless steel construction, as it's easy to keep clean and less prone to dirt and bacteria buildup. You can even stick parts into the dishwasher to clean. This fountain can also hold up to 7 liters of water, so you don’t have to refill as often. It’s fairly quiet at around 35 decibels, but it gets louder when the water is running low (a red light warns you when it needs a refill). You should clean once a week and rinse the filter. The filter packs are relatively affordable at $15 for a pack of eight, and you need to swap them once a month. — Simon Hill Petlipo Cordless Cat Water Fountain for $57 : This all-plastic pet fountain sits on dock for easier tank cleaning and is rechargeable for up to 60 days of cordless power, has a wire-free pump, a large 2.6 liter capacity, and three customizable water flow modes (induction, timer, and continuous flow). The heavy duty filter is encased in a plastic cage and only needs to be replaced every 4 to 5 weeks. I had no issues while using this fountain, but at nearly $60, thats egregiously expensive for being made out of cheap (and bacteria-harboring) plastic. Although it's a solid fountain, I'd spend less and grab one of stainless steel picks. Not Recommended Photograph: Molly Higgins Petcube Ceramic Pet Water Fountain for $90 : I really wanted to love this fountain; although its basin is plastic, it had a ceramic top, which is more hygienic than plastic (and I had never tested a ceramic model before), and the brand makes some of my favorite pet cameras . However, setup was a bit confusing, it took a long time to get the base charged to power the fountain's water flow, and the sensor to begin water flow is only triggered from one side, making placement awkward. After a few days, it would only run while plugged in, soon its stream was barely strong enough to reach the top, and after just over a week it stopped working altogether. Also, it's egregiously expensive for a pet fountain. Photograph: Molly Higgins Cat Mate 3-Level Pet Fountain for $28 : This tall automatic Cat Mate fountain sets itself apart with three tiers for cats who like to drink at every level. Cleaning the motor requires disassembly using tools and extended soaking. Because of the long distance the water has to travel, evaporation caused the water to need to be refilled about every other day. Plastic also harbors bacteria, and previous plastic models I’ve owned have had mold issues. The basin is quite large and sits flat. Because of this, some debris would sit in the bottom and front of the large basin rather than moving back to the filter system behind. The plastic material and lack of ergonomic gravity design caused this fountain to be dirtier than others. Whisker City Free Fall Cat Fountain for $30 : This huge fountain is better suited for dogs—with a large 150-fluid-ounce bowl and a waterfall design. Although the basin has a small splash pad to help offset the waterfall noise, this was one of the loudest fountains I tested. The evaporation from the waterfall-like system also caused me to refill it every other day. Because of the structure of the fountain, my cats had to bend their head at an awkward angle. They tended to avoid drinking from the basin because of that, and their heads got slightly wet from the splatter of the waterfall. The basin is also not angled so crumbs and debris sit at the bottom of the bowl. Petkit EverSweet Solo SE for $26 : This very simple, straightforward fountain has a square-shaped body, is translucent to easily see water levels from he outside, and has a nearly silent 25-decibel cordless pump to circulate water from the basin to the top level, where 60 milliliters of water is always available for drinking, even in case of power failure. The basin sits on a base and all parts easily detach, making it easier to clean. This fountain doesn’t have multiple modes or an associated app—you’ll have to check water levels manually. I noticed this fountain wasn’t as cold as some of the others, and because of the design of the top, debris often pooled in the dipped areas, which made me clean it often. AccordionItemContainerButton I used each of these for a week as my cats’ main source of water. As mentioned, I noted the ease of setting up, evaluated parts and filters, and generally compared the various types of water fountains—spigot, bubbling, or waterfall. Some flows were continuous and some were intermittent (my cats didn’t prefer intermittent). Cats may also be intrigued and want to play with the machine rather than drink, so be sure to give them time and keep another water source around until they are fully adjusted to the new gadget. AccordionItemContainerButton Cats sometimes struggle to consume enough water, which can lead to potentially lethal UTIs and blockages in male cats especially. This is one of the reasons vets are moving more toward encouraging owners to give their cat at least a partially wet food diet, as this helps them consume more moisture, especially since cats don’t naturally consume as much water as dogs. Unlike dogs, cats are generally quite particular in their likes and dislikes, and cats can see stagnant water as potentially harmful. (If the cat was in the wild, stagnant water has more potential for harmful bacteria). Cats are more drawn to moving water in nature, and these fountains help encourage them to drink more by emulating what they’re naturally drawn to. While automatic water fountains are better for your cats' overall water consumption, they do require a bit more work and money. Rather than refilling a bowl, these take a little more elbow grease—but it’s worth it for your cat’s health. Along with routine refilling and cleaning, you’ll need to disassemble the fountain to clean all parts, including using a brush for the bowl and tubes. You may also have to disassemble the motor to deep-clean because of mineral buildup. These also have different types of filtration cartridges in specific shapes for the brand’s fountains, which require you to buy and change out filters, usually monthly but sometimes more often. AccordionItemContainerButton Let’s be honest, a lot of these fountains are pretty much the same. I looked especially for the overall design—I am a fiend for stainless steel because of the potential of porous plastic harboring harmful bacteria . I also favor a wide reservoir without high sides to help reduce the chance for whisker fatigue . I prefer fountains that have a small basin reservoir of water available at all times, in case of low water levels or power failure. I took into account ease of setting up, refilling, and cleaning, as well as overall design. And of course, there were some that my cats took to straight away, and some they didn’t seem to favor as much. After prolonged testing, I now look for these three things and encourage you too as well: a cordless pump for easier (and safer) cleaning, constructed from stainless steel so it's more hygienic, and a window to monitor water levels (especially if it's not connected to an app).

eaf9b8cdd2a0,"The Best Laptops for Work and Play, Wherever You Are","laptops, computers, buying guides, shopping, windows, macbook, chromebooks, windows pcs","How Much Should You Spend on a Laptop? AccordionItemContainerButton If you're shopping for a laptop, you probably have an idea of how much you want to spend. But some context might help put things in perspective. The cheapest laptops cost around $200, but they can range up to $5,000. Meanwhile, the average amount people spend, according to the best data we have , is around $750. That lands decidedly in the midrange, spitting between the more expensive devices that are over $1,000 and the budget-tier machines you find below $700. When we talk about pricing, it's often the “starting” price of the laptop, meaning the lowest-priced configuration. This is really important to consider, as you want to compare devices apples-to-apples as much as possible. For example, a cheaper laptop might start at $750 with 256 GB of storage, while a more premium laptop might start at this same price but come with 512 GB or even 1 TB of storage. Increasingly, you can find some really decent laptops around this price, some of which we’ve listed below. If your budget needs to be under $750, though, there are still good options. Laptops below this price tend to compromise in one area or another. Most commonly, it's the quality of the display and touchpad that suffers, as these are things you can't see from a spec sheet or reference photo. Chromebooks often give you the best bang for your buck, especially if you're trying to spend $500 or less. So, why spend more? Well, there are two primary reasons. First, you might want a more premium design, perhaps one that has a more daring aesthetic or high-end components. Take the MacBook Pro, for example. It starts at $600 more than the MacBook Air but comes with a brighter Mini-LED display, significantly better speakers, and more ports. The second primary reason to spend more than $750 or so is to get more performance. Whether for gaming or for content creation, laptops with discrete GPUs are more expensive, which is why it's hard to find a worthwhile gaming laptop under $1,000. If you're buying a gaming laptop , plan to spend at least $1,500. What Are the Best Laptop Brands? AccordionItemContainerButton Unlike the smartphone world, the biggest laptop brands have been around in the tech industry for over 40 years by now. Taking Apple out of the picture, four laptop brands stand above the rest, following the latest trends and technology, while backing that up with reliable support and services. Lenovo is the biggest PC brand in the world, at least in terms of global shipments . It's perhaps most well-known for its familiar sub-brands like ThinkPad and Yoga, but it also isn't afraid to take risks with more experimental designs and advanced technology. Lenovo has also made a name for itself in the gaming space too with its Legion laptops, known for balancing performance and features at the most competitive prices. Asus has quickly become a favorite, notable for its sheer number of laptops available in the consumer market. The company takes a similar approach to Lenovo, and that's led Asus to quickly innovate on new technology and designs , while also launching premium clamshell laptops at more affordable prices than its competitors. Gaming laptops in particular are a space that Asus has come to dominate in, with the ROG Zephyrus, Strix, and TUF brands leading the way. Dell and HP are a bit more conservative, though they aren't without their notable designs as well. Interestingly, the companies have both gone through a significant laptop rebrand in the past year. HP has introduced “Omnibook” as a replacement to the Spectre and Envy sub-brands in 2024, while Dell started 2025 by removing its well-known sub-brands entirely, including Inspiron and XPS. Other laptop makers in the mix include Microsoft Surface, Samsung, Acer, LG, and MSI, though none of them have as big a footprint globally as the top four. How Do I Choose the Right Laptop? AccordionItemContainerButton If none of these laptops quite rings your bell, that's OK! There are far more laptops than we have time to test. To help you make smart choices, we put together a complete laptop buying guide . We also have the details about all the CPUs and GPUs you need to know about for 2025 . We recommend sticking to these guidelines: RAM: In most cases, make sure you get 16 GB of RAM. That's become the new standard, in even more affordable laptops. Upgrading to 32 GB is even better and means you never have to worry about running out of memory, especially if you're a gamer or video editor. CPU: In the world of Windows laptops, you have three CPU brands to choose from: Intel, AMD, or Qualcomm. Intel’s Core Ultra Series 2 launched in late 2024, providing a huge increase in battery life. It also has the best integrated graphics of the three. AMD chips are primarily reserved for gaming laptops, as they’ve struggled to take much ground from Intel. Qualcomm’s Snapdragon X chips, however, have challenged Intel in a serious way over the past year with its ARM-based chips, offering some of the best battery life we've ever seen on Windows machines. Discrete graphics: Want to play AAA PC games or edit video on your laptop? You’ll likely want a standalone graphics processor, and at this point, Nvidia is the primary option. The RTX 5090 launched this year as the most powerful new GPU available, but the 40-series still remains a good option. Integrated graphics have improved significantly over the years though too, especially with Apple's M4 line. Screen: The display depends on the size of the laptop. A 1200-pixel resolution (HD+) screen on a 13- or 14-inch laptop looks sharp enough, but you’ll want more pixels on larger displays. While IPS screens will be good enough for most people, OLED or Mini-LED are becoming more common, which provide better color accuracy, contrast, and even decent HDR performance. Connectivity : Ports are important, though everyone needs something different. For most people, though, we suggest at least two USB-C ports and at least one USB-A and HDMI for those legacy devices. (Remember that nearly all laptops today use one of those USB-C ports for the power adapter.) Thankfully, most laptops still have headphone jacks, but always check, because a few daring machines have dropped it. Lastly, make sure there's Wi-Fi 6E support or newer. Even if you don't have a Wi-Fi 6E or Wi-Fi 7 router yet, it's a good bet you will in the future (see our Best Routers or Best Mesh Systems guides if you need a new one). Battery life: Battery life is extremely competitive these days, with Apple, Qualcomm, and Intel all making highly ambitious battery life claims. Most laptops with the latest chips (and without discrete graphics) will get you over 10 hours of battery life, or many more if your workload is lighter. Intel vs. AMD vs. Qualcomm AccordionItemContainerButton In the world of Windows laptops, there are three primary options for CPUs: Intel, AMD, and Qualcomm. All three companies have good options but it really depends on the type of laptop. For premium laptops, you'll want something like the Intel Core Ultra 258V or Qualcomm Snapdragon X Elite. Meanwhile, for budget laptops, Snapdragon X is the best option. And for gaming laptops, I'd recommend something from AMD like the Ryzen AI 9 365. Intel and AMD are the eternal rivals in the game, while Qualcomm is the new competitor in the ring. Qualcomm made a huge entrance in 2024 with its Snapdragon X chips. These Arm-based chips, like Apple's M-series chips, emphasize efficiency, which drastically improves battery life. This has been a game-changer for Windows laptops across a wide range of price points. The Qualcomm Snapdragon X Elite is the highest end option in terms of performance, but the Snapdragon X Plus and base Snapdragon X still equally strong battery life, despite showing up in much cheaper laptops. (Qualcomm recently unveiled the Snapdragon X2 platform .) But Intel and AMD haven't been sitting on their hands either. Despite all of Intel's financial woes, the company put out a surprisingly strong release with its Core Ultra Series 2. The V-series chips, also known as Lunar Lake, came out in late 2024 and provided comparably good battery life to Qualcomm and Apple. They also have the most powerful integrated graphics you'll find on basic consumer Windows laptops. Unfortunately, Intel's lineup of chips is convoluted and an horribly confusing, with three different generations of CPU architecture released in the past year. In addition to Lunar Lake, we also have Arrow Lake Core Ultra H chips and 14th-gen Raptor Lake Refresh for its highest-powered Core Ultra HX chips. Those HX chips even still use the old “Core i7” nomenclature, to make things even more confusing. (Intel recently announced its next-gen Panther Lake chips .) Over on Team Red, AMD has grown into a competitive player in the gaming laptop space in particular. Its latest gaming chips are the most powerful gaming hardware you'll find on a laptop, including the Ryzen 9 9950X3D and 9900X3D. Unfortunately, it's still hard to find many laptops supporting these killer chips. The company also has its Ryzen AI 300 H and HX chips, which are bit more commonly found across gaming laptops. AMD does have its mainstream chips as well, as part of the Ryzen AI 300 Series, but they haven't made their way into as many laptops at this point and don't have as long of battery life as Intel and Qualcomm's latest options. AccordionItemContainerButton I have been reviewing laptops for a decade, and WIRED contributor Chris Null has been testing these machines for 25 years. We test each laptop we review in a variety of situations, including both synthetic benchmark tests, real-world use cases, and comparisons against similar equipment. We don’t consider hardware in a vacuum: Our reviews aim to match laptops with the users that will benefit from them the most, taking performance, usability, portability, and price all into account. We put every laptop through a gauntlet of tests before writing a review and assigning them a rating. Hands-on use: Here's we evaluate the exterior of the device. We compare how thin and light it is against other laptops. We repeatedly open and close the lid to test the quality and ease of use of the hinge. We push on weak points like the keyboard and lid to test build quality. We furiously type on the keyboard and swipe around on the touchpad to ensure it's comfortable and precise. These are all things you can't see just by looking at a device's landing page on Amazon. We use the laptop itself for many days (and sometimes weeks) to report on any quirks that might pop up, such as oddly placed ports, a surfeit of preloaded shovelware, or unexpected problems that make using the laptop difficult. Sights and sounds: Once we boot up a device itself, it's all about the sights and sounds of the laptop. The screen is paramount, as its the world through which you experience the entirety of the device. There's a lot you can tell about the brightness, colors, and contrast of a display just by looking at it. Beyond just subjective testing, we also use a Spyder colorimeter to measure the brightness, contrast, color space, and color accuracy of a display. If it's an HDR-capable screen, we also test the peak brightness of the display in HDR content. We also test the webcam and speakers of a laptop to see if they are worthy of your video calls and music streaming sessions. Performance testing: Finally, we test performance. There's a lot of ways to go about this, but we always evaluate a laptop's performance based on what it's intended for. We don't expect a $500 budget laptop to performance like a powerhouse gaming laptop, nor we expect a gaming laptop to get 18 hours of battery life. Our testbed includes more than 20 synthetic benchmarks, though this is constantly evolving and is dependent on the unit’s CPU and operating system, as macOS and Snapdragon-based laptops have fewer benchmarks available. Those benchmarks include various tests within the latest versions of Geekbench, PCMark, 3DMark, Procyon, GFXBench, Pugetbench, Superposition, Cinebench, and various gaming-related tests such as 3DMark and Cyberpunk 2077 . Note that WIRED does not, in general, report raw benchmark scores. We don't only pay attention to the scores these benchmarks produce, but also the volume and speed of the fans, the surface temperature of the laptop, and the affect it has on battery life. It's a lot, I know. But we're thorough because we want to stand by our recommendations, and ensure that the laptops we rate highly are worth the money. Compare Top 15 Laptops Other Good Laptops We’ve Tested Photograph: Luke Larsen Lenovo ThinkBook Plus Gen 6 Rollable for $3,299 : Don't you dare write this one off as a gimmick. Yes, it's fun as just a pure spectacle, but Lenovo took this far more seriously than I thought it would. In case you haven't heard, it's a laptop that can extend its screen vertically from 14 inches to 16.7 inches at the press of a key, giving you quick access to more screen whenever you need it. As it turns out, it's also a great ergonomic solution, too. The only problem with the ThinkBook Plus Rollable (7/10, WIRED Recommends) ? It's been sold out for the past month, so you can't buy it yet. Hopefully, it'll be back in stock soon. Lenovo Yoga Pro 9i 16 for $1,950 : If you're looking for a proper Windows alternative to the powerful MacBook Pro, this is the best one I've tested so far. The Yoga Pro 9i 16 (7/10, WIRED Recommends) has two important features: a discrete RTX 5050 or 5060 GPU and a killer OLED display. Combine that with an excellent keyboard and touchpad, and even great speakers, and you have the whole package. I wish the battery life were better, but that's an area where it'll never quite compete with the MacBook Pro. Dell 14 Premium for $1,250 : It might be one of the prettiest laptops ever made, but it's also one of the most controversial designs in recent years. The Dell 14 Premium (6/10, WIRED Review) is the renamed successor to the Dell XPS 14, sporting the same divisive function row keys, invisible haptic trackpad, and limited ports. I'd have been happy to overlook those design elements (as they make for an ultra-modern aesthetic) if only Dell had been able to upgrade this from the RTX 4050 to the RTX 5050 series graphics cards. Without that GPU performance upgrade, my excitement has dulled for what this could be. Lenovo IdeaPad 5i 16 2-in-1 for $698 : As I've said multiple times in this guide, Windows laptops at around $650 to $700 are really hard to pull off. There will almost always be some compromises. There's no getting around that. The IdeaPad 5i 2-in-1 just barely walks the tightrope without tipping over. Like many of these devices, it has a crummy screen, a tiresome keyboard, and an imprecise-feeling touchpad. The battery life was decent, however, and I liked that the display is touchscreen and glossy. For the price, the specs aren't half bad. If you like larger laptop displays, this is the cheapest one you should buy. Surface Pro 12 Photograph: Luke Larsen Microsoft Surface Pro 12 for $900 : While it’s a tablet, the Surface Pro 12 (6/10, WIRED Review) is designed to be a true laptop replacement as well, which is why it's on this list. Its price would be excellent for a fanless machine running on the Snapdragon X chip, but it doesn't come bundled with a keyboard. Once you add that in, this becomes more of a premium laptop. Still, for the right person, it's a killer travel device for taking your work on the road with you. ROG Flow Z13 Photograph: Luke Larsen Asus ROG Flow Z13 for $2,100 : It's too expensive for most people to take a chance on, but I found a lot to like about the ROG Flow Z13 (7/10, WIRED Recommends) . This gaming 2-in-1, a design no one asked for, works surprisingly well. The performance isn't full throttle, but the Z13's use of surprisingly powerful AMD integrated graphics makes it far more powerful than you might assume, all while keeping the heat away from your hands. Asus Zenbook A14 for $580 : This is one of the lightest laptops we've ever tested, thanks to Asus' Ceraluminum material. The Zenbook A14 (8/10, WIRED Recommends) is also the first A-series laptop from the company, and it employs Qualcomm's new Snapdragon X chipset, which is the weakest and supposedly the most affordable of the Snapdragon X series. While this laptop excels in build quality, portability, and sports excellent battery life, the chipset is lackluster, only suitable for average web browsing tasks. This one occasionally drops in price by a couple of hundred bucks, so try to avoid the $1,000 MSRP if you can. Lenovo Flex 5i Chromebook Plus for $482 : This was one of the first “Chromebook Plus” devices we tested, and it's still among the best. While the newer Lenovo Chromebook Plus 14 is a higher-quality device, the Lenovo Flex 5i Chromebook Plus (8/10, WIRED Recommends) comes in a couple of hundred dollars cheaper, which makes it attractive, especially for a Chromebook. You'll still get 8 GB of RAM and 128 GB of storage, too. Lenovo Yoga Slim 7i Aura Edition (Copilot+ PC) for $1,300 : The first Intel-based Copilot+ PC we tested, the Yoga Slim 7i Aura Edition (7/10, WIRED Review) is a winner on all fronts, boasting outstanding AI and graphics performance and some of the best battery life we’ve ever seen on Intel hardware. With its slightly oddball 15.3-inch screen, it hits its high points without breaking the bank, though the fan is loud and the system may weigh you down more than you’d like. Acer Chromebook Plus 515 for $365 : This 15-inch Chromebook Plus 515 (8/10, WIRED Recommends) has the same internal components as the Lenovo we recommend above. The battery life for this one is a solid 8.5 hours of full-screen video playback time. The Acer offers an HDMI 1.4 output jack in place of the Lenovo's microSD card slot, making this one a better choice if you frequently need to give presentations or otherwise use the HDMI port. There's also the smaller Chromebook Plus 514 that's equally great . Lenovo Yoga Slim 7x Copilot+ PC for $1,300 : Lenovo's svelte Slim 7x (7/10, WIRED Review) isn't exciting, but it offers the best price-to-performance ratio of the many Copilot+ PCs we've tested. Battery life and performance are standouts, though the fan does tend to run loud. What Kinds of Laptops to Avoid Amazon is filled with laptops you shouldn't buy. Just type in “best laptop” into the Amazon search box, and you'll find plenty of cheap laptops that no one should buy. That includes most of the Windows laptops under $500, which all use CPUs from three or four generations ago. It gets worse when you search for “gaming laptops” on Amazon , which presents some cheap laptops that don't even have discrete graphics. Regardless of what companies or retailers try to say, you shouldn't expect a laptop without a discrete GPU to be able to play modern games. Some of these include laptops from knockoff brands you've never heard of, like this one . There's just no reason to buy something from an unknown brand. When it comes to gaming laptops in general, I wouldn't recommend buying anything RTX 30-series or older in terms of graphics. You should still be able to find some decent RTX 40-series laptops that are a better bang-for-your-buck than the new RTX 50-series laptops. Lastly, there's the topic of refurbished laptops. Online retailers are full of older laptops that are marked as refurbished or “renewed.” These can be good options, especially if they come heavily discounted, such as this M1 MacBook Air . But there's always some risk with buying refurbished. Make sure you read the retailer's return policy. With models that are only a year or two older, however, pay careful attention to the specs, especially when it comes to RAM capacity. For example, some older M3 MacBook Air models will show up with only 8 GB of RAM, not reflecting the increased base memory in the price. Power up with unlimited access to WIRED .

3c9e0cbdb827,Review: Specialized S-Works Levo 4 Electric Mountain Bike,"shopping, bicycles, outdoors, reviews, review, electric bikes","The next ride was on singletrack from my house to Spirit Mountain , Duluth’s downhill lift-accessed park with 24 trails ranging from easy to expert. Lacking a full-face helmet and the landing skills to tackle double-black runs like the one called Calculated Risk, I instead rode Candyland. The machine-built flow trail has some nice high, snaky berms where the bike’s chunky tires kept me upright and stable. I had so much fun tooling around in the bike park, riding up steep inclines like The Puker to get one last flowy downhill ride in, that I had to hurry home for dinner in the dusk. On the way home, I chickened out while riding a chunky, steep, and extended rock bridge in Trail mode and experienced the only moment of fear in my entire 50-plus miles of testing thus far—I had already committed to forward momentum but chickened out at the last second, so the bike surged forward while I bailed sideways into the bushes. It was more user lack of confidence than bike glitch, but also a good reminder of two things: how powerful the bike is and how it’s only as competent as its rider. At home, I checked the Specialized app and found that I had climbed 3,451 feet over 22 miles in about two hours, primarily in the bike’s Auto mode. I still had 44 percent battery power and energy in my legs. Smart Ride Photograph: Stephanie Pearson After subsequent rides, what stands out the most about the Turbo Levo 4 is how intuitive it is. The bike's high-performance torque sensors can instantly “feel” the rider's output and amplify it, while maintaining control, traction, and precision at higher speeds. This is especially evident in Auto mode, which is the most natural feeling of the four Eco, Auto, Trail, and Turbo modes, all of which are easy to read on the bike's Master Mind computer on the top tube. I was a little on the fence about the Turbo Levo’s ability to jump from a Class I to a Class III electric mountain bike. On US versions of the bike, riders can tweak the speed limit by toggling through Master Mind and upping the Class I limit of 20 mph to the Class III 28 mph limit. It’s an easy process designed for mountain bikers who ride along city streets to the trails. But it also raises a question: What ripper is going to want to toggle back down to a Class I bike—the max limit on most trails throughout the US—unless the speed police are in hot pursuit? By allowing this work-around into a higher speed-limit category, Specialized puts the onus on the rider to follow the rules, which opens a Pandora’s box—especially on trails inhabited by mostly nonmotorized mountain bikers where safety is a greater concern. Other than the ethical conundrum, my one small beef with the S-Works Turbo Levo 4 is that it’s so much fun that it suspends time. I’m so in the flow that I forget to go home and make dinner.",https://www.wired.com/review/specialized-s-works-levo-4,Technology,BBC,Stephanie Pearson,"https://media.wired.com/photos/68e9bae68983e0899b9e6c4b/191:100/w_1280,c_limit/Review-%20Specialized%20S-Works%20Levo%204%20Electric%20Mountain%20Bike.png",2025-10-12T08:00:00-04:00,d02fdbe44faefaea413e8f8dbf71c6933404b3b6
03be66d081fa,A New Algorithm Makes It Faster to Find the Shortest Paths,"quanta magazine, science, computer science, algorithms","The original version of this story appeared in Quanta Magazine . If you want to solve a tricky problem, it often helps to get organized. You might, for example, break the problem into pieces and tackle the easiest pieces first. But this kind of sorting has a cost. You may end up spending too much time putting the pieces in order. This dilemma is especially relevant to one of the most iconic problems in computer science: finding the shortest path from a specific starting point in a network to every other point. It’s like a souped-up version of a problem you need to solve each time you move: learning the best route from your new home to work, the gym, and the supermarket. “Shortest paths is a beautiful problem that anyone in the world can relate to,” said Mikkel Thorup , a computer scientist at the University of Copenhagen. Intuitively, it should be easiest to find the shortest path to nearby destinations. So if you want to design the fastest possible algorithm for the shortest-paths problem, it seems reasonable to start by finding the closest point, then the next-closest, and so on. But to do that, you need to repeatedly figure out which point is closest. You’ll sort the points by distance as you go. There’s a fundamental speed limit for any algorithm that follows this approach: You can’t go any faster than the time it takes to sort. Forty years ago, researchers designing shortest-paths algorithms ran up against this “sorting barrier.” Now, a team of researchers has devised a new algorithm that breaks it . It doesn’t sort, and it runs faster than any algorithm that does. “The authors were audacious in thinking they could break this barrier,” said Robert Tarjan , a computer scientist at Princeton University. “It’s an amazing result.” The Frontier of Knowledge To analyze the shortest-paths problem mathematically, researchers use the language of graphs—networks of points, or nodes, connected by lines. Each link between nodes is labeled with a number called its weight, which can represent the length of that segment or the time needed to traverse it. There are usually many routes between any two nodes, and the shortest is the one whose weights add up to the smallest number. Given a graph and a specific “source” node, an algorithm’s goal is to find the shortest path to every other node. The most famous shortest-paths algorithm , devised by the pioneering computer scientist Edsger Dijkstra in 1956, starts at the source and works outward step by step. It’s an effective approach, because knowing the shortest path to nearby nodes can help you find the shortest paths to more distant ones. But because the end result is a sorted list of shortest paths, the sorting barrier sets a fundamental limit on how fast the algorithm can run.",https://www.wired.com/story/new-method-is-the-fastest-way-to-find-the-best-routes,Technology,BBC,Ben Brubaker,"https://media.wired.com/photos/68e4e925d48737d73f99218c/191:100/w_1280,c_limit/Fastest%20Shortest%20Paths%20cr-DVDP-Default.jpg",2025-10-12T11:00:00+00:00,4daa42de1f5963117c925bab3702ee7742f13051
1ae4d0c4e04a,Should You Cancel Xbox Game Pass? Everything to Know on the Price Hikes and New Features,"video games, pc games, console games, gaming culture, xbox, microsoft, subscriptions","Like it or loathe it, we live in a subscription economy. Music, movies, meal boxes, and more are no longer things you buy once. They’re a constant draw on your wallet. Gaming is no exception , and while every major player in the sector has some form of sub for players—from PlayStation Plus and Nintendo Switch Online for consoles to Apple Arcade on phones—none of them offered quite as much for a modest monthly fee as Xbox Game Pass. Depending on the subscription tier, the service gave players access to a significant library of titles and was available on Xbox consoles, PC, or via cloud gaming. While most of its competitors focused on back-catalog titles for their gaming subscriptions, Game Pass stood apart by including major first-party titles on their day of release for subscribers to its Ultimate tier. Microsoft long claimed it was “the best deal in gaming,” and with new releases costing upwards of $70 per title versus a $19.99 monthly price tag on Game Pass Ultimate, it was hard to argue. Recent changes to the service, however—including some hefty price rises—have upset users in a big way, sending so many people rushing to cancel their subscriptions that the membership site crashed . What’s Happened? On October 1, Microsoft revamped the entire structure of Game Pass . Previously, and following an earlier rejig in September 2024 , players had essentially four options—Game Pass for PC, Game Pass Core, Game Pass Standard, and Game Pass Ultimate. Going forward, Core is replaced with Essential, and Standard is replaced with Premium, while Ultimate retains its name. All tiers are now accessible on PC, although a dedicated PC-only plan remains available. It’s not the rebrand that’s had people canceling, though—it’s the hefty price hikes that have come with the upper tiers. While Essential keeps the almost totemic $9.99-per-month pricing of Core, Premium jumps to $14.99 from Standard’s $11.99 (a 25 percent increase), and the PC-only offering goes from $11.99 to $16.49 (a 38 percent increase). It’s Game Pass Ultimate that’s proven the most contentious, leaping from $19.99 to $29.99. Price increases on subscription services routinely boil the frog and creep up in price slowly—just look at what you used to pay for Netflix—but a massive 50 percent spike overnight, the equivalent of $120 more a year, has caught many off guard. It doesn't help that it follows two price hikes on Xbox consoles themselves in the span of less than a year, at least in the US. In May 2025, the 512-GB Xbox Series S went from $299.99 to $379.99, the 1-TB Xbox Series X from $499.99 to $599.99, and the 2-TB Series X from $599.99 to $729.99. These prices rose globally, with prices reflected in each territory. But then, in September, prices rose again for buyers in America, taking those same models to $399.99, $649.99, and $799.99, respectively. Microsoft cited the increases being “due to changes in the macroeconomic environment”—read: tariffs —but the combined effect on pricing across the whole Xbox ecosystem really challenges that “best deal in gaming” idea.",https://www.wired.com/story/should-you-cancel-xbox-game-pass-everything-to-know-on-the-price-hikes-and-new-features,Technology,BBC,Matt Kamen,"https://media.wired.com/photos/68e94ff269566abd2b9c6cca/191:100/w_1280,c_limit/GettyImages-1836054547.jpg",2025-10-12T10:00:00+00:00,53c64ccc67ec80a03a2ec11ec1b528ba1f9b540f
7d061389ac99,The Best Carpet Cleaners to Resurrect Your Rugs,"shopping, buying guides, cleaning, how we clean, vacuums, home","Compare Our Picks Others Tested Photograph: Simon Hill Hoover HF4 Hydro for £199 : For UK folks in flats or small houses with a mix of carpet and hard floor, this cordless, space-saving vacuum and mop from Hoover could be a smart pick. You get a standard cordless stick vac with around half an hour of battery life, but you can switch the head to mop. It’s excellent for cleaning hard floors, with a shape that gets right into corners and two rotating pads to lift stains. But the water tank, contained within the head, is tiny, the vacuum is only moderately powerful at lifting, and battery life drops to just 15 minutes in turbo mode. Hoover SmartWash Automatic Carpet Cleaner for $250 : It's bulky, but it has automatic cleaning and drying cycles—pushing it forward releases the solution and pulling it back starts the drying process. After you've gone over the whole area, you can turn just the drying mode on for an extra pass if the carpet needs it. The handle comes out with the click of a button, and you can use its separate tank with a cleaning solution to spot-treat before vacuuming. A hose and separate antimicrobial pet tool can clean stairs or any other hard-to-reach areas that need extra elbow grease. Some customer reviews say it worked well for a few months but then shorted out. We'll keep trying it to see if we run into that issue. — Medea Giordano Bissell Little Green Portable Carpet Cleaner for $79 : If you've landed on the cleaning side of TikTok , you've probably seen people cleaning their carpets and furniture with this Little Green machine. This opens up the world of upholstery cleaning too, not just carpets. It worked well and it's easier to store and tote around your house than our top pick. But use the included hose-cleaning tool frequently. These hoses can get nasty. — Brenda Stolyar Cleaners We Like for Hard Floors Photograph: Simon Hill Dreame H14 Pro for $380 : The Dreame H14 Pro is quite large, but I found it easy to maneuver, and it can lie flat to get under furniture. A handy LED headlight helps you see what you are cleaning clearly. A full charge proved enough to do all my hard floors twice over, and the result was super shiny. What I love about this vac is that it effectively cleans up dry or wet spills, so whether you are cleaning cat litter or a spilled bowl of cereal, it performs. It’s best for cleaning recent spills but can shift stubborn stains with repeated passes on Ultra mode. When you finish, you can return it to the charging cradle and trigger the self-cleaning mode to sterilize the soft roller and dry it (though it gets loud and takes a long time). No one wants to install an app or create an account just to use a vacuum, but it enables you to choose modes and schedule the self-cleaning, which could be handy if you want it to wait until you go out. — Simon Hill Shark S5003D Genius Steam Mop for $100 : This steam mop is great for cleaning hardwood, tiles, or laminate flooring (not carpets). Simply fill the water tank, plug it in, and attach one of the mop pads. It has three heat levels, and you press down to release a jet of steam for stubborn stains. There’s no need for any detergent, it’s light and maneuverable, and it doesn’t require much space. The clever pad design enables you to flip it over when one side is soiled, and the mechanism makes it easy to attach, with a button to detach the dirty pad, which is machine washable. (You get two pads in the box.) I regularly use this mop to clean laminate, composite, and tile floors, but you must be careful using steam, especially on wood or vinyl flooring. Test it on the lowest heat setting before going over the whole floor. There are no special attachments or extras here, and it’s only suitable for use on hard floors. You also need to empty any remaining water if you don’t plan on using it for a while, or the tank can go nasty. — Simon Hill Karcher SC 3 for $164 : If your budget can stretch, this option is better if you want attachments and the option to steam-clean harder-to-reach surfaces and your hard floors. It’s good for complete kitchen or bathroom cleaning without the need for any detergent or other products. It's effective for cleaning glass and mirrors too. It only comes with one microfiber cover, and it’s not recommended for use on fabrics or carpets. — Simon Hill Not Recommended Eufy E28 HydroJet Robot Vacuum with Carpet Cleaner for $1,400 : I generally love Eufy’s attractive, smart, multipurpose robot vacuums, and since I have two dogs and two kids, I was expecting to love a robot vacuum that could also mop hardwood floors and has a detachable carpet cleaner. Unfortunately, the water injection system is wonky. It has to be perfectly positioned to get water from the portable carpet cleaner tank (I often had to tap it into place), and every time I mopped, it leaked constantly all over my kitchen floor. At least the carpet cleaner was effective. — Adrienne So Things to Consider When Shopping for a Carpet Cleaner AccordionItemContainerButton There is a lot to think about when shopping for or using a carpet cleaner, such as how much space you'll need for storage and whether you should rent or buy. Here are some tips to keep in mind. Carpet cleaners are heavy and bulky , especially when filled with water. They can be harder to maneuver than regular upright vacuums. They will also need quite a bit of storage space. Tackle stain-causing spills immediately . Most households only need to wash carpets once every six months to a year, but spot cleaners are ideal for treating immediate spills, plus they're easier to store and use. You likely won't use a carpet cleaner often , so it's OK to consider hiring professionals to do your whole home, especially if you have limited storage space. (It also can depend on how dirty and stained your carpets are.) Look at options for renting a machine from local businesses or retail stores like Home Depot. You'll be able to get the benefits of a commercial-grade cleaner without paying a fortune. Clean your carpet before you use a carpet cleaner . This may seem counterintuitive, but you don’t want dirt and hair to form wet clumps that block the cleaner. And if you haven’t washed your carpets in a while (or ever), be prepared for an embarrassing amount of hairy clogs to fill the dirty water tank. The carpet shampoo or detergent you use is important . Manufacturers often insist you use their brand, and while other types may work fine, you might void your warranty (although I have no idea how they'd know). Most carpet cleaners come with some detergent. Try, try, and try again. It can be disappointing to fire up a carpet cleaner and find that it’s incapable of removing that old red wine stain or ground-in toothpaste. Don’t lose heart. Multiple cleaning sessions can sometimes chip away at established stains, and at least reduce, if not remove, them. Drying your carpets can take a long time . Most carpet cleaners have different settings, and they will suck up some of the water, but they all leave carpets a bit damp. The deeper cleans tend to leave carpets wet, so think about how you might speed drying time. Use fans, fire up the heating, or do your carpet cleaning in the spring and summer months when you can leave windows open. Protect your hearing. Of all the ways you can damage your hearing, a carpet cleaner is perhaps the least fun, so protect your ears. Some of these get very loud, so wear earplugs while you work.

16e7946c9800,Review: Amazfit T-Rex 3 Pro,"shopping, review, reviews, outdoors, fitness trackers, wearables, fitness","Offline routing is supposed to be one of the banner features of this watch. You should be able to just pick a point in the Maps app on the watch, then choose Straight-Line Navigation or Route Navigation. Unless you’re in a wide-open field, Straight-Line won’t help you much, but Route Navigation should parse the watch's ability to read roads and trails to get you where you're going. Then you choose between Outdoor Running, Walking, or Outdoor Cycling. Why isn’t hiking included? Who knows, but it doesn’t really matter because 90 percent of the time I tried it, the watch would just say, “Route Creation Failed. Try Again.” I only managed to get it to work a couple of times, and only for extremely short distances, and one of those times it advised me to run on Interstate 405, which is one of the largest, busiest highways in the country. I would not rely on this feature. There’s just a general sense of unfinishedness to the whole thing. Questionable translations abound. It missed waves while I was surfing. It still doesn't recognize the types of strength training that you're doing, which is a feature that was promised earlier this year and is readily available on all other sports watches at this point.

977abd36f35e,Review: Lenovo Yoga Pro 9i 16,"laptops, reviews, review, shopping, computers, windows, windows pcs","We shouldn’t expect any Windows laptop with a powerful discrete GPU to truly replicate what the MacBook Pro does. Yes, there are more powerful systems out there, but efficiency is just not what those systems are about. Even with the improvements Nvidia has made in Advanced Optimus (automatic switching between discrete GPU when needed), the battery life suffers, especially while running heavier applications. On a local video playback test, the Yoga Pro 9i 16 lasted for around 12 hours. Despite using the same 84-watt-hour battery, this appears to be a slight improvement over last year's model, though it's hard to get an apples-to-apples comparison. I do know that its battery life diminishes quickly under heavy load, as it died in just 45 minutes while running a benchmark. You'll want to be plugged in if you're doing anything too serious. Regardless of the task, you'll get over twice the battery life on an M4 Max MacBook Pro. Not until we get ARM-based systems with powerful integrated graphics that rival the M4 Pro and M4 Max will there be competition for Apple. The closest thing we’ve seen so far is AMD’s unique Ryzen AI Max+ processor, which showed up on the Asus ROG Flow Z13 and used a massive integrated graphics chip to challenge traditional discrete graphics. But we’ve still got a long way to go. The only other Windows laptop that could be better is the Asus ProArt P16 , which I've yet to test. It now even comes with an RTX 5070 or 5090 option, which could make it significantly more powerful than the Yoga Pro 9i. However, it's also a much more expensive laptop, configured with a 4K OLED screen and only higher-end GPUs. The Yoga Pro 9i is also hundreds of dollars cheaper than the Dell 16 Premium when similarly configured. The Lenovo Yoga Pro 9i 16 gets a lot of things right—plenty enough to make it worth a recommendation as a valid MacBook Pro competitor. Ultimately, it’s the performance, display, and premium quality that make it a worthy content creation machine, and the Yoga Pro 9i succeeds on all those fronts, perhaps better than any other Windows machine I’ve tested.",https://www.wired.com/review/lenovo-yoga-pro-9i-16,Technology,BBC,Luke Larsen,"https://media.wired.com/photos/68e96bf77c192a1493f91916/191:100/w_1280,c_limit/IMG_1898.JPG",2025-10-11T08:00:00-04:00,5251cf49e0547d88cbb38ee6f1f3491df97edd28
1f3424e77ff8,The 26 Best Shows on Amazon Prime Right Now,"tv, streaming, amazon, culture guides","While Netflix is busy pumping out more series than any one person could watch (probably), some of the best shows are on Amazon Prime Video. Trouble is, navigating the service’s labyrinthine menus can make finding the right series a pain. We’re here to help. Below are our favorite Amazon series—all included with your Prime subscription.

If you buy something using links in our stories, we may earn a commission. This helps support our journalism. Learn more . The Girlfriend When working class Cherry Laine (Olivia Cooke) meets wealthy Danny Sanderson (Laurie Davidson), sparks fly—until she meets his mother Laura (Robin Wright). Overbearing and with an unhealthy level of control over her son’s life, Laura is set on destroying anyone who comes between them. Or maybe ... Laura is a caring mother, alert to Cherry’s suspicious behavior, and desperate to save her son from a con artist—or worse. In this twisty psychological thriller, based on a novel by Michelle Frances, you can never quite tell who to trust, which is almost the best part, second only to the sensational chemistry between Wright and Cooke as they alternately try to charm, outwit, or destroy each other. Exploring themes of class, power, and control, The Girlfriend is six episodes of brilliantly tense drama. Butterfly Years ago, David Jung (Daniel Dae Kim) and Juno Lund (Piper Perabo) formed the private intelligence organization Caddis, reshaping global security from the shadows. Then, Lund ripped the operation out from under Jung—and took his daughter Rebecca (Reina Hardesty) with it, raising her to become an unstoppable assassin. Reunited in the aftermath of a hit on a Russian ambassador in Seoul, David and Rebecca find themselves on the run across South Korea, unsure if they can even trust each other, and with Caddis hot on their heels. A blend of next-level action choreography and family drama exploring themes of abandonment, Butterfly is an explosive twist on bring-your-kid-to-work day. Ballard A spin-off from Bosch, one of Prime’s biggest hits, Ballard is another creation of crime author Michael Connelly, seeing detective Renée Ballard (Maggie Q, Designated Survivor ) stepping up as head of a newly formed cold-case unit. Left with no budget and no official support, Ballard hastily assembles a team of volunteers that includes her retired former partner Thomas Laffont (John Carroll Lynch) and disillusioned former cop Zamira Parker (Courtney Taylor). They soon find that diving into forgotten cases can mean unearthing secrets powerful people want to keep buried. A blend of crime-of-the-week cases and season-long mysteries make Ballard both a cozy procedural and a riveting longer-form drama, buoyed by a fantastic cast—including Titus Welliver reprising his role as Connellyverse staple Harry Bosch. The Second Best Hospital in the Galaxy If about 300 seasons of Grey's Anatomy hasn't scratched your medical drama itch, then a visit to The Second Best Hospital in the Galaxy might be just the treatment you need. Riffing on the hospital procedural genre and giving it a sci-fi twist, the show follows alien medics Dr. Sleech (Stephanie Hsu) and Dr. Klak (Keke Palmer) as they tackle the wildest diseases and injuries the universe can throw at them—from an anxiety-eating brain worm to a shape-shifting STI—all while navigating messy relationships and personal drama. See, just like Grey’s . Created by Russian Doll writer Cirocco Dunlap—bringing that show’s Natasha Lyonne along as the voice of occasionally invisible Nurse Tup—this Saharan-dry adult animated comedy will cure what ails you. Overcompensating Benny is so deep in the closet, he's found Narnia. And rather than using his freshman year of college as a chance to find himself, he's maintaining the illusion of heterosexuality by throwing himself into a campus life of partying, drinking, and chasing girls. The consequences, for Benny and his new best friend Carmen (Wally Beram), will be severe … but hilarious. Created by comedian Benito Skinner, who also stars as Benny, Overcompensating is a foul-mouthed and ferociously funny college comedy that's almost painfully authentic in its depiction of the fine line between self-exploration and weapons-grade cringe. Mobile Suit Gundam GQuuuuuuX Prime Video doesn't tend to pick up as much anime as rival Netflix does, but when it does, it's often something big . Mobile Suit Gundam GQuuuuuuX (it's pronounced “gee-kwux,” before you ask), takes things back to the very beginning of the iconic mecha franchise and asks a simple question: What if the bad guys, the “space Nazis” of the Principality of Zeon, won a crucial war? Don't worry if you can't tell a beam saber from a core fighter though—this alternate reality focuses on brand new character Amate Yuzuriha, a high school student thrust into a world of mounting military tensions after an experimental Gundam crashes into the space colony where she lives. GQuuuuuux also marks a creative high for Gundam , with Evangelion studio Khara bringing its dynamic style of animation to the series, but beyond the phenomenally flashy visuals, this has some real emotional depth, using a science fiction lens to explore how people can find hope and fight for freedom, even in the darkest of timelines. Weekly episodes drop on Tuesdays. The Wheel of Time The Wheel of Time has been a bit of a slow burn, but now this fantasy series is a raging fire. The first season introduced magic weaver Moiraine (Rosamund Pike) and her quest to uncover which of five unassuming young people is destined to save or destroy the world, then the second upped the stakes—returning ancient evils while scattering the only people able to stop them. The newly dropped third season pays it off in spades, though, opening with a ferocious battle between brutal woman warriors—a genre rarity—while setting the stage for Rand al’Thor (Josha Stradowski) to seize that dangerous destiny, one way or the other. Based on Robert Jordan’s sprawling novel series—one so vast it makes Game of Thrones look concise—this visually stunning series has cemented itself as the finest fantasy show around. Reacher Amazon has a way with action thrillers focused on military tough guys who answer to “Jack R.” First there was Jack Ryan , who also makes an appearance in this guide. Then there was Reacher , the sharp adaptation of Lee Child’s Jack Reacher novels, now in its third season. Alan Ritchson ( Titans , Fast X ) stars as the physically imposing Reacher, a former military policeman now drifting from town to town, trying to live a quiet life but unable to avoid conflict. Season one found him accused of a murder he didn't commit, before season two drew him into a vast conspiracy. The newly arrived third—based on the seventh novel, Persuader —sees him up against his biggest threat yet: Paulie, an even bigger hulk of muscle (played by 7′2″ Olivier Richters). Sure, Reacher is also working undercover for the DEA and tracking down an old enemy, but three seasons in, the show is confident enough to play to its pulpy strengths, with top-tier fight choreography and surprisingly sharp dialog helping it punch above its weight. Invincible Mark Grayson inherited the incredible powers and abilities of his father, Omni-Man—only to learn dear old dad wasn't a paragon of justice but the vanguard for an alien invasion. The newly dropped third season of Invincible finds Mark not only still struggling to escape his father's shadow, guiding his younger brother to use his own burgeoning powers responsibly, but also drowning in a world of murky politics, pushed toward darker, tougher choices to keep Earth safe. A brilliantly animated adaptation of the hit Image comic book by writer Robert Kirkman and artists Cory Walker and Ryan Ottley, Invincible ’s more mature take on superheroes allows it to do something Marvel and DC characters rarely do: grow up. The Man in the High Castle This adaptation of sci-fi master Philip K. Dick’s novel about a world in which the Nazis won the Second World War was one of Amazon’s first forays into original content. The world-building is stunningly done—a divided, alternate-reality 1960s America never seemed so plausible—but be warned: There might be just a touch too much present-day resonance for some viewers. The Rig Back for its second season, sci-fi thriller The Rig finds the surviving crew of isolated North Sea oil rig Kinloch Bravo forcibly relocated to The Stac, an even more remote facility in the Arctic. While most are desperate for answers and a way home, the team’s loyalties are tested as the sinister Pictor corporation seeks to use them to unearth something ancient and powerful from the sea floor. While The Rig doesn’t even aspire to subtlety when it comes to its ecological metaphors (one character even says, “If you keep punching holes in the Earth, eventually the Earth’s going to punch back”), it’s all brilliantly shot to make use of both the claustrophobic settings and the terrifying expanses and underwater pressures of the ocean. With the material elevated by a phenomenal cast of Game of Thrones and Line of Duty veterans, including Iain Glen and Rochenda Sandall—and bolstered further by the addition of the always-watchable Alice Krige in season 2— The Rig is far more than the guilty pleasure it might otherwise be. Cross Aldis Hodge steps into the shoes of Washington, DC homicide detective Alex Cross in Prime's new series based on James Patterson's long-running series of crime novels. However, unlike the streamer's other thrillers Bosch and Reacher , Cross doesn't directly adapt any of Patterson's books—a risky move, but one that largely pays off, allowing this eight-episode first season to chart an unpredictable journey as Cross faces off against a twisted murderer who models each of his kills on another serial killer. Already renewed for a second season, Cross is a strong addition to Prime's roster of crime dramas. Citadel: Diana Amazon tried to make a splash with its $300 million spy thriller Citadel in 2023, but only half-succeeded. The Richard Madden- and Priyanka Chopra-starring action series was entertaining enough—and rode high on Prime Video’s most-watched lists—but didn’t exactly set the world alight. However, it did establish a sprawling shared universe, with rival organizations Citadel and Manticore engaged in a globe-spanning cold war setting the stage for international spin-offs. Citadel: Diana is the first, an Italian outing focusing on Diana (Matilda De Angelis), a woman out for revenge after her parents are killed, and drawn into the spy-fi underworld with violent results. Gorgeous location shoots, bone-crunching fight choreography, and, most importantly, a tighter focus help Diana improve on its parent series. The Legend of Vox Machina Bawdy, gory, and absolutely not for kids, The Legend of Vox Machina follows the eponymous adventurers' guild—consisting of gunslingers, druids, and the requisite horny bard—as they grow from a motley crew of usually-drunk mercenaries into unexpected heroes for the realm of Exandria. The newly arrived third season continues the team's battle against the Chroma Conclave, a horrifyingly powerful collective of dragons. It's a quest that sends them on a small diversion to Hell itself. Adapting the hit Critical Role —the livestreamed Dungeons & Dragons sessions of some of the biggest voice actors in animation and gaming—this exquisitely animated fantasy takes things in unexpected directions that keep things fresh for new or returning viewers alike. A love letter to D&D that's also unafraid to poke fun at the classic RPG, it's one of the most original adult animated shows on Prime. The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power Tapping into The Lord of the Rings creator J. R. R. Tolkien’s sprawling history of Middle-earth, The Rings of Power is set millennia before the events of the core books (or films, which is really where the visual language of this adaptation comes from), detailing the major events of Tolkien’s Second Age. While the first season was a slow burn, dwelling on the fractious politics of the era, the second ratchets up the pace considerably. From Galadriel (Morfydd Clark) trying to prevent the ascension of Dark Lord Sauron (Charlie Vickers) to the long-awaited introduction of fan-favorite character Tom Bombadil (Rory Kinnear), the new season feels far richer and deeper than before. It remains a feast for the eyes too, with the stratospheric budget apparent in every frame, from quiet moments in luxuriant shires to cinematic battles between armies of Orcs and Elves. For sheer high fantasy spectacle, there’s little else to rival this streaming right now. Batman: Caped Crusader The first new solo Batman animated series in a decade, Caped Crusader harkens back to Batman: The Animated Series from the 1990s, with showrunner Bruce Timm returning to the Dark Knight and Hamish Linklater voicing Bruce Wayne/Batman in an ode to the late, great Kevin Conroy. Unlike rival ‘90s revival X-Men ’97, though, this isn't a continuation but rather a wholly distinct take allowing for fresh interpretations of the iconic hero’s rogues’ gallery and allies—look out for drastically different takes on the Penguin and Harley Quinn in particular. Leaning heavily into a 1930s aesthetic that evokes Batman’s earliest comic book origins, this manages to be nostalgic and provocative at once—a fantastic outing that takes DC's original urban vigilante back to his gritty pulp noir roots. The Boys Superheroes are meant to represent hope and optimism—the best of us, given outsize form. In The Boys , adapted from the darkly satirical comic by Garth Ennis and Darick Robertson, they’re a reflection of humanity’s worst—greed and unrestrained power, marketed to a gullible public by vested corporate interests, operating without restraint and leaving a trail of bodies in their wake. Enter Billy Butcher (Karl Urban) and his associates The Boys, gleefully dispatching “Supes” who’ve gone too far, often in extraordinarily violent ways. Unfortunately, the newly dropped fourth season finds the team in disarray, fractured by Butcher’s own lies, right as the world needs them most. Arch-manipulator Victoria Neuman (Claudia Doumit) is close to the Oval Office, while the sadistic, psychotic Homelander (Antony Starr) is planning a superhuman uprising. Probably Amazon’s goriest show, The Boys stands as a pertinent examination of the abuses of power, all wrapped in superhero drag. Fallout Maybe the end of the world is the secret sauce to making a great video game adaptation—between The Last of Us and now this spectacular interpretation of Bethesda's postapocalyptic RPG series, we're living in an unexpected golden era for the form. Yet unlike HBO's bleak but beautiful world, Fallout taps into the source material to craft an apocalypse with a very different feel, one dripping in cracked Americana, black comedy, razor-sharp social satire, and just a little bit of camp. Its greatest strength, though, lies in how it doesn’t directly adapt any one of the core Fallout games. Instead, it perfectly channels their tone and feel, focusing on a core trio—naive Lucy (Ella Purnell), born and raised in a subterranean vault; driven Maximus (Aaron Moten), a recruit in an army seeking technology from the old world; and the Ghoul (Walton Goggins), a centuries-old bounty hunter mutated into a nigh-immortal zombie when the bombs fell—to showcase just how brilliantly twisted this nuclear wasteland really is. Three-Body No, you're not on the Netflix list—Prime Video has its own distinct adaptation of Cixin Liu's The Three-Body Problem . This take, originally released for Chinese audiences back in 2023, faithfully adapts Liu's award-winning novel of humanity's first contact with an almost unknowable alien species and the impact that their impending arrival on Earth has on humanity. Hopping between time periods, a galactic mystery unfurls after nanotech specialist Wang Miao (Luyi Zhang) is called in by detective Shi Qiang (Hewei Yu) to investigate a global spate of suicides among scientists, with the ominous phrase ""Physics doesn't exist"" being the only link between the deaths. Although Three-Body is a bit softer than Netflix's 3 Body Problem when dealing with some aspects of the story—notably anything related to China's Cultural Revolution—a hearty 30-episode run allows for far more space to explore Liu's complex themes and vast roster of characters. The pacing may take some getting used to for viewers more accustomed to western TV, and it's subtitled-only, but this C-drama is out of this world. Mr. and Mrs. Smith You likely know the concept from the name alone—a married couple operate as undercover agents, blurring the lines between their personal and professional relationship. Unlike the 2005 Brad Pitt/Angelina Jolie movie, though, 2024's Mr. and Mrs. Smith does far more with the concept. Donald Glover (who cocreated this reboot) and Maya Erskine offer much more developed takes on the mysterious characters of “John” and “Jane” Smith over the course of this eight-episode series, exploring their true identities, why they signed up for their dangerous careers, and whether their growing feelings for each other are just part of the roles they're playing. It's all backed up with plenty of Mission: Impossible –style action, of course, but it’s the sparkling chemistry between the show's leads that will leave you thinking, “Brangelina who?” Gen V Spinning out of Amazon's hit The Boys , Gen V follows the next generation of supes, training their abilities at the Godolkin University School of Crimefighting. In keeping with its twisted parent show, this educational establishment is less Xavier's School for Gifted Youngsters and more The Hunger Games with superpowers, as students battle for glory and a chance to join premier super-team The Seven. Lead Jaz Sinclair ( Chilling Adventures of Sabrina ) impresses as freshman Marie Moreau, a haemokinetic with lofty ambitions who uncovers dark secrets at the college that challenge her entire world view. Factor in all the poor life choices college students are famed for and some extremely creative (if often disgusting) superpowers, then allow for The Boys' trademark ultraviolence, and one thing's for sure—the kids of Gen V are most definitely not alright. Jack Ryan There's no shortage of screen adaptations of Tom Clancy's Jack Ryan books, but John Krasinski's turn as the CIA desk jockey turned field agent gets far more room to breathe than its predecessors. The prestige political thriller charts Ryan's rise from analyst to operative—and beyond—over four perfectly crafted seasons. The final season caps Ryan's career with his biggest challenge yet, investigating the convergence of a drug cartel and a terrorist organization set to create an unstoppable criminal enterprise, all while juggling the CIA's possible involvement in a political assassination in Nigeria. While the show hasn't been without controversies—season two attracted condemnation from Venezuela's government for supposedly condoning a US invasion of the country; big yikes there—its sharp writing, incredible performances, and cinematic action make it compelling viewing. I'm a Virgo A surrealist comedy with the sharp political and social edge viewers have come to expect from creator and director Boots Riley ( Sorry to Bother You ), I’m a Virgo follows Cootie (Jharrel Jerome), a regular 19-year-old who just happens to be 13 feet tall. Raised in secrecy by Aunt Lafrancine (Carmen Ejogo) and Uncle Martisse (Mike Epps), Cootie is thrust into the limelight when his larger-than-life existence is inevitably discovered. Experiencing friendships and the outside world for the first time, gentle giant Cootie has to navigate everything from romance to the public’s reaction to a giant Black man wandering around Oakland. Oh, and did we mention Cootie’s idol, The Hero, a real-life superhero with an authoritarian streak that would put some of the worst offenders on The Boys to shame? Told you this was surreal. Do yourself a favor and watch the behind-the-scenes episodes too, tucked under Prime Video’s “Explore” tab, for Riley’s insight into each episode. Tales From the Loop Despite being a couple of years old, Tales From the Loop remains one of the most mesmerizing shows on Prime Video. Loosely based on the work of Swedish artist Simon Stålenhag , the series blurs the line between ongoing narrative and anthology as it follows the residents of Mercer, Ohio, exploring how their intersecting lives are impacted by “the Loop,” an underground facility exploring experimental physics and making the impossible possible. Expect tales of frozen time, traded lives, and parallel worlds, all brought to life by a fantastic cast and directors—including Andrew Stanton and Jodie Foster. But it’s the visuals that really elevate this show, which captures the sublime aesthetic of Stålenhag’s work and juxtaposes neofuturism and rural communities for a world that looks and feels like almost nothing else. At only eight episodes, a visit to Mercer is brief but unforgettable. The Underground Railroad Based on the Pulitzer Prize–winning novel by Colson Whitehead, this limited series from Moonlight director Barry Jenkins sticks pretty closely to the premise of the book. It’s a work of historical fiction that takes the idea of the Underground Railroad—the network of smugglers who helped escaped slaves flee the South—and reimagines it as an actual subway system with trains and secretive station agents. The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel What is a New York lady to do when she finds out her husband is having an affair with his dim-witted secretary? If Mrs. Maisel is anything to go by, the answer is to head to a dingy watering hole in your nightgown, do a little standup comedy, and get hauled away by the police after flashing the entire audience. Set in the 1950s, this fast-talking fashionista hides her new life as a comedian from her family and ex while battling sexism, bad crowds, and big competition. Rachel Brosnahan stars as Midge Maisel in this subtle nod to Joan Rivers’ career.

4a757e8cd7c6,Australia’s March Toward 100 Percent Clean Energy,"climate desk, science, environment, energy, renewable energy, australia","“[The clutch] is like 1950s technology—it’s really boring,” Westerman said (“boring,” for grid operators, is the highest form of praise). ​“The marginal cost of putting this in is like nothing compared to the cost of the plant.” A company called SSS has built these clutches for decades. One is nearly operational in the state of Queensland at the Townsville gas-fired plant, which Siemens Energy is converting into what it calls a ​“hybrid rotating grid stabilizer.” Siemens says this project is the world’s first such conversion of a gas turbine of this size. That particular retrofit took about 18 months and involved some relocating of auxiliary components at Townsville to make room for the new clutch . So it’s not instantaneous, but far easier than building a new synchronous condenser from scratch, and about half the cost, per Siemens. Some novel long-duration storage techniques also provide their own spinning mass. Canadian startup Hydrostor expects to break ground early next year on a fully permitted and contracted project in Broken Hill, a city deep in the Outback of New South Wales. Broken Hill lent its name to BHP, which started there as a silver mine in 1885 and has grown to one of the largest global mining companies. More recently, the desert landscape played host to the postapocalyptic car chases of Mad Max 2. Now, roughly 18,000 people live there, at the end of one long line connecting to the broader grid. Hydrostor will shore up local power by excavating an underground cavity and compressing air into it; releasing the compressed air turns a turbine to regenerate up to 200 megawatts for up to eight hours, serving the community if the grid connection goes down and otherwise shipping clean power to the broader grid. But unlike batteries, Hydrostor’s technology uses old-school generators, and its compressors contribute additional spinning metal. “We have a clutch spec’d in for New South Wales, because they need the inertia,” Hydrostor CEO Jon Norman said. ​“It’s so simple; it’s like the same clutches on your standard car.” Transmission grid operator Transgrid ran a competitive process to determine the best way to provide system security to Broken Hill in the event it had to operate apart from the grid, Norman said. That analysis chose Hydrostor’s bid to simply insert a clutch when it installs its machinery. The project still needs to get built, but if up-and-coming clean storage technologies could step in to provide that grid security, it wouldn’t all have to come from ghostly gas plants lingering on the system. “It’s a different feeling [in Australia]—there’s a can do, go get ​’em, ​‘put me in coach’ attitude,” said Audrey Zibelman, the American grid expert who ran AEMO before Westerman. ​“When you’re determined to say how best to go about this, as opposed to why it’s hard or why it doesn’t work, the solutions appear.”",https://www.wired.com/story/as-coal-fades-australia-looks-to-realize-dream-of-100-renewable-energy,Technology,BBC,Julian Spector,"https://media.wired.com/photos/68e935c1fcb832a931e1319f/191:100/w_1280,c_limit/GettyImages-2202209773.jpg",2025-10-11T11:00:00+00:00,e3b8cc9bb9bc187bc97f168a2674800c355cc24f

The hustle fits into longstanding campaigns by the hermit kingdom to steal billions of dollars from organizations around the world using careful planning and coordination to pose as professionals in all different fields. Under pressure from the Department of Justice, Apple removed a series of apps from its iOS App Store this month related to monitoring US Immigration and Customs Enforcement activity and archiving content related to ICE's actions. As more apps are removed, multiple developers told WIRED this week that they aren't giving up on fighting Apple over the decisions—and many are still distributing their apps on other platforms in the meantime. WIRED examined increasing warnings from software supply chain security researchers that the proliferation of AI-generated software in codebases will create an even more extreme version of the code transparency and accountability issues that have come up with widespread integration of open source software components. And Apple announced expansions of its bug bounty program this week, including a maximum $2 million payout for certain exploit chains that could be abused to distribute spyware, and additional bonuses for exploits found in Apple's Lockdown Mode or in beta versions of new software. But wait, there's more! Each week, we round up the security and privacy news we didn’t report in depth ourselves. Click the headlines to read the full stories. And stay safe out there. The notorious spyware vendor NSO Group, known for developing the Pegasus malware, has faced financial issues since losing a long legal battle against the secure messaging platform WhatsApp as well as a lawsuit filed by Apple. Now, the company, which has long had Israeli ownership, has been purchased by a group of US-based investors led by movie producer Robert Simonds, who helped finance Happy Gilmore , Billy Madison , The Pink Panther , Hustlers , and Ferrari , among many other films. The deal is reportedly worth “several tens of millions of dollars” and is close to completion. Israel’s Defense Export Control Agency (DECA) within the Ministry of Defense will need to approve the sale. Use of mercenary spyware has increased within some US federal government agencies since the beginning of the Trump administration. Hundreds of national security and cybersecurity specialists who work in the US Department of Homeland Security have faced mandatory reassignment in recent weeks to roles related to President Donald Trump’s mass deportation agenda. Bloomberg reports that affected workers are largely senior staffers who are not union eligible. Workers who refuse to move roles will reportedly be dismissed. Members of DHS’s Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) who have faced reassignment reportedly worked on “issuing alerts about threats against US agencies and critical infrastructure.” For example, CISA’s Capacity Building team has faced a number of reassignments, which could hinder access to emergency recommendations and directives for high-value federal government assets. Workers have been moved to agencies including Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Customs and Border Protection, and the Federal Protective Service. A recent breach of a third-party customer service provider used by the communication platform Discord included a trove of data from more than 70,000 Discord users that contained identification documents as well as selfies, email addresses, phone numbers, some home location information, and more. The data was collected as part of age verification checks, a mechanism that has long been criticized for centralizing users’ sensitive information. 404 Media reports that the breach was perpetrated by attackers who are attempting to extort Discord. “This is about to get really ugly,” the hackers wrote in a Telegram channel on Wednesday while posting the stolen data. US Immigration and Customs Enforcement inked a $825,000 contract in May with TechOps Specialty Vehicles (TOSV), a Maryland-based company that manufactures equipment and vehicles for law enforcement. The company provides products including rogue cellphone towers that are used for phone surveillance and sometimes called “stingrays” or “cell-site simulators.” Public records reviewed by TechCrunch show that the agreement describes how the company “provides Cell Site Simulator (CSS) Vehicles to support the Homeland Security Technical Operations program” and is a modification for “additional CSS Vehicles.” TOSV also began a similar $818,000 contract with ICE in September 2024, prior to the start of the Trump administration. In an email to TechCrunch, TOSV president Jon Brianas declined to share details about the contracts but confirmed that the company does provide cell-site simulators.

727b09e7e78e,"Gear News of the Week: Intel’s New Chips Arrive, and Apple May Debut iPads and MacBooks This Month","shopping, gear roundup, apple, meta, sony, playstation, google, logitech, intel","Intel's future has never seemed so uncertain. But most of the company's roller-coaster ride of a year has been a lead-up to its next-gen CPU launch, announced this week. The chips will be known as Intel Core Ultra Series 3, codenamed Panther Lake, and they're being manufactured in its new Arizona-based fabrication plant . Intel claims the first configurations will ship before the end of the year and then more broadly starting in January 2026. We don't have a complete lineup yet, but Panther Lake will include up to 16-core CPUs with a ""more than 50 percent faster CPU"" performance over the previous generation. Intel claims that the new integrated GPU with have up to 12 GPU cores that are also 50 percent faster than the prior generation, boosted by a new architecture. Intel is fighting back against the stiff competition. Qualcomm dramatically entered the Windows laptop race in 2024 with its Arm-based, highly-efficient Snapdragon X chips, doubling the battery life of current Intel-powered laptops in some cases. While Intel was able to respond to the battery-life competition with its Core Ultra Series 2 V-series chips in late 2024, performance took a hit on these laptops, and the efficiency only applied to flagship, thin, and light laptops. Budget-level and high-performance laptops used a different architecture and therefore didn't get that same bump in efficiency. That made shopping for a laptop in 2025 even more head-scratching than normal. These next chips will attempt to fix this problem, with the company promising “Lunar Lake–level power efficiency” and “Arrow Lake–class performance.” Intel really needs to achieve that promise, because with Qualcomm's Snapdragon X2 Elite having just been previewed and the Apple M5 on the way, the stakes keep rising. — Luke Larsen Apple’s Next Hardware Launch Is Coming Soon Tim Cook on stage during the Apple Keynote on September 9, 2025. Photograph: Julian Chokkattu If you're thinking, didn't Apple just have an event? Yes, the company debuted new iPhones, Apple Watches, and AirPods just last month. But rumors are heating up that the company will announce more products this month, focused on iPads and MacBooks . That's not unusual, as the company has held October events for the past few years, usually for the tablet and Mac lineups. It's unclear whether this will be an actual event or a silent launch via press release. The company has done both in the past. So what can you expect? The marquee announcement will revolve around the anticipated M5 chipset, which may debut inside a new MacBook Pro and the iPad Pro. The flagship tablet likely won't look or feel too different from the prior M4 version . MacBooks are a little more up in the air on launch timing; it could be at this event or early in 2026. If they are announced, it'll be a new 14- and 16-inch MacBook Pro with an M5, M5 Pro, and M5 Max chip. Apple has also reportedly been gearing up for a budget MacBook launch powered by an iPhone processor, but this may arrive early in 2026 instead. Other hardware that may debut at this October event includes a new Vision Pro powered by an M4 or M5 chip with a comfier head strap, though it's otherwise the same as the original headset . There may be a new Apple TV with a faster chipset, the new version of Siri (though this won't come until 2026), and Wi-Fi 7 support. And we may finally see a second-gen AirTag , with a longer range.

0939fcf4990f,Review: Corvette E-Ray,"cars, evs and hybrids, automotive, reviews, general motors","A 1.9-kWh lithium-ion battery has been packaged within the car’s already beefy central tunnel, and additional cooling has been added to manage battery temperature. There’s also new software to harmonize all the components. The hybrid adds 160 bhp for a total system power output of 645 bhp, which is almost identical to the amount produced by the thunderous ZO6. On top of that, the more overtly aero-oriented comp-inspired car also donates its wide-body look, the previously optional carbon-ceramic brakes are standard, and the tires epically chunky: 275/30ZR-20s at the front, 345/25ZR-21s at the rear. (Specially developed all-season Michelin Pilot Sports are available.) Riotous Design We’re not sure the car’s visuals are quite equal to the ambition being exercised elsewhere, though. The Corvette’s design trajectory since its 1953 launch is instructive of American automotive design overall, the ’60s C2 Sting Ray and ’80s C4 iterations culturally relative high-points. The latest car is an incoherent riot of competing angles and edges, undeniably dramatic and a crowd-pleaser to judge by the reaction it generates during WIRED's drive. But still no oil painting. It’s unrepentantly expressive inside, too. It’s easy to get in and out of, the doors opening wide, the seats more luxurious in feel and amply cushioned compared to its more minimalist rivals. The steering wheel is one of those fashionably square items, its spars oddly downcast. But the driving position is good, the view ahead helped by fairly slender A pillars. A rear-view camera mirror helps ease reversing anxiety, usually a tricky thing in a mid-engined car. Multi-configurable instrument dials lie straight ahead, there’s a crisp Head-Up Display, and an angled touchscreen handles the infotainment. Then there’s that swooping central tunnel, the leading edge of which houses the switchgear that operates the climate control and various other functions. Fearing total ergonomic catastrophe, it’s a surprise to discover that it all actually works well in practice. Electric Stealth Given that the Corvette’s V-8 is totemic, the E-Ray’s principal hybrid party trick is its “stealth” mode, which does what it says: enables the car to exit your street under near-silent electric-only propulsion. Its range in this mode is barely a few miles, but still, this is briefly an electric, front-drive Corvette. What a novelty.

He is a professor at Rutgers University and he wrote a book almost a decade ago about antifa, and he's currently trying to flee the United States for Europe. This comes after an online campaign against him led by far-right influencers eventually escalated into death threats. On Sunday, this professor informed his students that he would be moving to Europe with his partner and his young children. OK, Leah, you've obviously been following this really, really closely. What happened next? Leah Feiger: Well, Mark and his family got to the airport, they scanned their passports, they got their boarding passes, checked in their bags, went through security, did everything. Got to their gate and United Airlines told them that between checking in, checking their bags, doing all of this, and getting to their gate, someone had actually canceled their reservation. Zoë Schiffer: Oh, my gosh. Leah Feiger: It's not clear what happened. Mark is of the belief that there is something nefarious at foot. He's currently trying to get out. We reached out to United Airlines for comment, they don't have anything for us. The Trump administration hasn't commented. DHS claims that Customs and Border Patrol and TSA are not across this. But this is understandably a really, really scary moment for anyone that is even perceived to be speaking out against the Trump administration. Zoë Schiffer: OK, I feel like we need to back up here because obviously, the Trump administration in his second term is very focused on antifa. But can you give me a little back story on why this has escalated so sharply just recently? Leah Feiger: Yeah, absolutely. This has been growing for quite some time. How many unfortunate rambling speeches have we heard from President Donald J. Trump about how antifa and leftist political violence was going to destroy the country? To be clear, that's not factual. Antifa isn't actually some organized group, this is an ideology of antifascist activists around the country. The very essence of being antifascist is not organized in this way. This all really kicked off on September 22nd when Trump issued his antifa executive order where he designated anyone involved in this and affiliated and supporting basically is a domestic terrorist. DHS has repeated this widely as well. And we're now in a situation where far-right influencers, Fox News every single day is like, ""antifa did this, antifa did this, antifa did this."" Listeners are probably familiar with antifa following the George Floyd 2020 protests when a lot if right-wingers claimed that antifa was taking over Portland and they were the reasons for all this. But it's been a couple of years since it's been super back on the main stage, so it's really just been the last few weeks.",https://www.wired.com/story/uncanny-valley-podcast-wired-roundup-are-we-in-an-ai-bubble,Technology,BBC,Zoë Schiffer,"https://media.wired.com/photos/68e81570a68ae1e7a129fd64/191:100/w_1280,c_limit/openai-value-biz-2181653413.jpg",2025-10-10T19:50:22.811000+00:00,efa903df2d651af8574a5018c9e91f1cac43dd38

I've been using the SteelSeries Arctis GameBuds (9/10, WIRED Recommends) for months for both gaming and everyday use, and they're currently marked down at Amazon to just $128, in both a black Xbox version , and a white Playstation version . Photograph: Eric Ravenscraft SteelSeries Arctis GameBuds While most gamers opt for over-ear headsets , there are actually quite a few advantages to using earbuds instead. For starters, they're much more portable, which is particularly important if you play on your phone or a gaming handheld. My favorite Switch 2 carrying case has a convenient storage pocket inside that these slip right into, so I don't have to go hunting for them in the overhead compartment once I'm already buckled in for a long flight. They also have great compatibility, with the discounted versions supporting either Xbox or PlayStation, and both styles playing well with Switch, PC, and smartphones without any additional software or drivers. The compact USB-C dongle fits right into the case, and has a horizontal layout that lets it sit cleanly on top of consoles or phones, providing low-latency 2.4GHz audio, as well as BLuetooth for just listening to tunes. Battery life is right up there with other wireless earbuds, managing around 10 hours in just the buds, and pushing 40 total with the charging case. I also really appreciate the SteelSeries mobile app. In addition to the normal settings you'd expect for active noise-canceling, there's a huge library of equalizer settings for popular games. You'd be surprised at how much of a difference these make, letting you switch between ideal setups for different games without having to set up any profiles or remember frequencies. They're really comfortable too, so much so that they've become my go-to earbuds for walking the dog or working out. They have a great fit and sound isolation, and even though it's personal preference, but the use of actual buttons instead of capacitive touch for controls makes bumping pause less likely.

fc4553550bee,The Shutdown Is Pushing Air Safety Workers to the Limit,"aviation, airlines, air travel, airports, government, politics, republicans, democrats","“We will never compromise on safety. When staffing constraints arise, the FAA will slow down air traffic at impacted airports to ensure operations remain safe,” FAA spokesperson Hannah Walden tells WIRED, adding that Transportation secretary Sean Duffy “ said that air traffic controllers who report to work will be paid. Regarding reductions in force (RIFs), DOT has been clear for months: safety critical positions—including air traffic controllers—have and will continue to be exempt from any RIFs.” In a written statement, a spokesperson for the TSA said of employees working without pay: “It’s unfortunate they have been put in this position due to political gamesmanship. Our hope is that Democrats will soon recognize the importance of opening the government.” On Thursday, Duffy suggested on Fox Business News that controllers and other workers who don’t come to work during the shutdown would be fired. “If we have a continual small subset of controllers that don’t show up to work, and they’re the problem children ... if we have some on our staff that aren’t dedicated like we need, we’re going to let them go,” said Duffy. One air traffic controller described this week’s working conditions as “pretty much the same” but with “an undercurrent of fear that the dipshits in charge will use this as an excuse to decertify our union and take away all bargaining rights.” Air traffic workers know that accusations of coordinated activity and sick-outs, or informal labor actions that could violate long-standing bargaining agreements with the government, are especially perilous right now, as federal officials threaten the status of public sector unions. The Trump administration suddenly ended TSA workers’ collective bargaining agreement in March, before a court preliminarily halted the move in June. Workers worry that taking an absence, even when it's needed, could have long-term consequences for their union—and therefore, their working conditions. The National Air Traffic Controllers Association did not respond to WIRED’s request for comment. But a pop-up on the public union’s website notes that it “does not endorse, support, or condone any federal employees participating in or endorsing a coordinated activity that negatively affects the capacity” of the National Airspace System. Jones, the TSA agent and union leader, says his group won’t organize sick-outs. But employees may have to call out if the lack of pay means “they don’t have the means to commute into work,” he says. “We are sick and tired of being political pawns for Washington,” adds Jones.",https://www.wired.com/story/shutdown-pushing-air-safety-workers,Technology,BBC,Aarian Marshall,"https://media.wired.com/photos/68e7ef0430f916543ceda2d5/191:100/w_1280,c_limit/GettyImages-2169077956.jpg",2025-10-10T16:45:26.597000+00:00,7c3a95e6cbfebe7f9943a5f6f9a0d7185d428ab9

But you still can't use three apps simultaneously (I miss the OnePlus Open's implementation of this.) If you want a folding phone, I suggest looking at the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold7 , which is thinner, lighter, and easier to use.

However, make sure you're spending far less than the MSRP—otherwise, you may as well buy one of the latest Pixel 10 phones. The previous Pixel generation from 2024 includes the Pixel 9, Pixel 9 Pro, Pixel 9 Pro XL (9/10, WIRED Recommends) , and the Pixel 9 Pro Fold (6/10, WIRED Review) . The Tensor G4 chipset in these phones is perfectly capable, the displays still get very bright, and the cameras aren't vastly different.

Google has a page you can check to see exactly what month your Pixel phone will stop receiving updates. Security updates reduce the risk of malware, keep your phone bug-free, and make it more secure. Android version updates introduce new features—cosmetic and functional—that improve the OS as a whole. Pixel phones also happen to be the first to receive any kind of Android update, so as soon as Google releases a new version, like Android 16 , you can download it immediately by heading to Settings > System > System Update > Check for Update . You can also test beta versions of Android, but you'll need to enroll your device . (Make sure to back up your phone first!) Pixels are also privy to the feature drops Google issues every few months, which include features from newer Pixels coming to older models and brand-new features for the latest devices. AccordionItemContainerButton Qi2 is the next-gen wireless charging standard , following the Qi wireless protocol. It uses magnets baked into the back of smartphones to perfectly align them with magnets in Qi2 wireless chargers, ensuring a faster and more efficient charge with less heat. It's practically the same as Apple's MagSafe technology (Apple helped develop the Qi2 standard), and all MagSafe iPhones now support Qi2, starting from the iPhone 12. However, not all phones that claim Qi2 functionality are actually Qi2 phones. Samsung's Galaxy S25 series is notably Qi2 Ready , meaning they don't have magnets inside, and the only way they can achieve the charging speeds and efficiency of Qi2 is with a magnetic case. You don't have to worry about that with the Pixel 10 phones. They're all proper Qi2 devices with magnets inside. Google calls it “Pixelsnap” and that's also the name its using for its suite of accessories. The Pixel 10 Pro XL is the only one of the lot that supports the even newer Qi2.2 25W standard, which bumps the charging speed from 15 watts to 25. That means it'll wireless charge the fastest, provided you use a compatible charger . If you have an older Qi wireless charger lying around, there's a chance it won't work all that well with the new phones. Qi2 is backward compatible, but we've run into issues with older chargers just not recharging devices consistently. You'll probably need to upgrade to a Qi2 charger. If you get a case ( read our guide !), make sure it's a Pixelsnap or Qi2 case with magnets inside. Without magnets, a case will weaken the magnets in the phone, and they won't stick well to Qi2 or other magnetic accessories. What About Older Pixel Phones? AccordionItemContainerButton There are a few other Pixel phones worth considering if you don't want any of the above choices. The Pixel 8 and Pixel 8 Pro ( 7/10, WIRED Recommends ) are available through official channels and third-party retailers (until supplies last). The key is to not pay more than $500 or $600 for either of them; otherwise, you may as well put that money toward the Pixel 9 or Pixel 10 series. I do not recommend you buy any older Pixel devices. Several Pixel A-series phones have been put under a battery performance program to mitigate the risk of overheating or swollen batteries. These software updates have crippled the battery life on those phones, and Google has provided customers with battery replacement options or Google Store credit for a new Pixel phone. These potential issues mean it's just not worth the risk of buying a Pixel 7a or Pixel 6a . I also don't think the Pixel 8a is worthwhile anymore as the price hasn't come down much; you're better off buying the Pixel 9a. Pixel A-Series Battery Issues AccordionItemContainerButton In 2025, some Google Pixel 4a and Pixel 6a owners have received mandatory updates that purposefully degrade the performance of the battery to prevent overheating. Your phone may have been working fine before, but Google issued these updates as a preventative measure, and not every device was affected. Similarly, some Pixel 7a devices may encounter battery swelling issues. If your phone has been affected, you have two options. You can get a free battery replacement—Google has a registration page for the Pixel 4a , Pixel 6a , and Pixel 7a . If that isn't going to work for you, you can get Google Store credit for the Pixel 4a and Pixel 6a to put toward a new Pixel phone. These issues seem to have only affected some batteries in the A-series phones, suggesting it's likely a supplier issue. What about the newer Pixel 9a? Here's a statement a Google spokesperson provided to WIRED: “Google continuously improves Pixel testing based on user feedback and thoroughly investigates reported incidents for all components, including batteries. With Pixel 9a, we delivered the largest and longest-lasting battery of any A-series yet. We’ve been encouraged by its reception so far and are confident in the phone’s longevity and durability.” Ideally, this battery issue has been rectified in the latest model, but we'll be monitoring it over the next few years. What Does Pixel Care+ Include? AccordionItemContainerButton When you purchase a Pixel from Google, you'll see the option to add Pixel Care+ for protection . It's only available in the US through the Google Store and Google Fi. The monthly option can run for up to 60 months, whereas the fixed pricing is for a 2-year term. Here's what you get. Pixel Care+ starts at $9 per month or $179 and includes unlimited accidental damage protection, $0 screen and battery repairs, replacements that ship in a day, and priority support from Pixel experts. That pricing is for the Pixel 10, and it goes up for the pricier devices. For example, the Pixel 10 Pro will cost $13 per month, or $239 for the 2-year term. There's no Pixel Care+ option for the Pixel 9a. Pixel Care+ with Loss and Theft starts at $10 per month or $199 and includes the same protections as mentioned above but includes two claims of loss and theft every 12 months. Weirdly, Loss and Theft coverage is not available in New York state. You Can DeGoogle Your Pixel Phone AccordionItemContainerButton Love Pixel phones but want to get away from using Google services ? It's a little odd, but you can actually use a different operating system with the Pixel instead of the built-in Android. We've tested and really like /e/OS, a privacy-first operating system that's based on the Android Open Source Project. While you can install it yourself, it requires a bit of technical know-how, you can buy a refurbished Pixel from Murena with /e/OS installed already. If you're interested, we have more details about /e/OS here . The Best Pixel Cases and Accessories I've written a broader guide on the Best Pixel 10 Cases and Best Pixel 9 (and 9a) Cases , but here are a few selections for your perusal. We've highlighted cases for the current Pixel lineup, but you can easily find the same versions for prior models if you peruse the case maker's catalog. Photograph: Julian Chokkattu Google Pixelsnap Phone Case for Pixel 10 Series These official cases from Google for the Pixel 10 series are Qi2-certified with Pixelsnap magnets baked in, allowing you to attach the phone to magnetic accessories without any loss in strength or wireless charging capabilities (if you use a case without magnets, it will weaken the strength and disrupt the feature). The soft silicone is pleasant to the touch, and you can color-match it with your Pixel 10 phone to highlight the phone's color. I also like Google's official Pixel 9a case ($30) , which is similar, but it doesn't have the magnets inside, as it's not a Qi2 phone. Photograph: Julian Chokkattu Mous Limitless Case (Pixelsnap) Mous cases are Made for Google certified, and that's especially important with the Pixel 10 series, as it ensures the best compatibility with Pixelsnap. The Limitless is a great all-rounder, with raised edges over the display, clicky buttons, reliable magnets for Qi2, and several design aesthetics you can choose from, including a walnut back or speckled fabric (pictured). Photograph: Julian Chokkattu dbrand Grip Case (Pixelsnap) Dbrand's Grip case lives up to its name. It has clicky buttons and incredibly grippy edges. It feels robust yet fairly slim, and you can choose a snazzy design. Just know that you have to apply this “skin” to the back of the case. There's a lot of room for error here, so be careful, and watch Dbrand's installation video for tips . There's Pixelsnap support so you can use your Pixel with Qi2 and even MagSafe accessories , and it worked exceptionally well in my testing. Photograph: Julian Chokkattu Bellroy Leather Case (Pixelsnap) Bellroy has been making Pixel cases for a long time, and it worked in collaboration with Google for the Pixel 10 cases, ensuring the perfect fit. It's Pixelsnap-certified (the Pixel 9a case doesn't have magnets), so it'll work with magnetic accessories. The leather comes from sustainable sources, and it exudes class. Photograph: Julian Chokkattu Peak Design Everyday Case for Pixel 10 (Magnetic) This is hands-down the best case if you frequently attach your Pixel to the handlebars of a bike or an electric scooter. Peak Design's mounting system lets you magnetically affix the phone to its Universal Bike Mount ($50) , and it stays put. After more than a year of testing, I've yet to have a phone fall off my ride using this mounting system. The company also has several other magnetic accessories , like a car vent mount . The case itself is nice; I just wish the edges were raised more for better screen protection. You can choose to have it with the loop, which acts as a grip, or without it. Photograph: Julian Chokkattu dbrand Ghost Case 2.0 (Pixelsnap) This is the best clear case for the Pixel 10 series. Dbrand promises that the Ghost 2.0 won't yellow over time, so much so that if it actually does, the company will replace it for free. It's thin, has stronger magnets than most other Pixelsnap cases, and has grippy edges. And you get to see your Pixel's color shine through. The company technically doesn't make it for the Pixel 10, just the Pro models, but because the dimensions are the same, the 10 Pro case fits perfectly on the Pixel 10. Photograph: Julian Chokkattu Google Pixelsnap Ring Stand Google's Ring Stand is a surprisingly sturdy and great kickstand. There's good tension in the metal ring, and you can adjust your phone at varying heights. You can also twist it to put the phone in landscape or portrait orientation. Make sure you take it off before placing the phone on a wireless charger; you're not supposed to attach magnetic accessories or chargers to the Ring Stand itself. Photograph: Julian Chokkattu Photograph: Julian Chokkattu Google Pixelsnap Charger With Stand You don't need to spend this much for a decent Qi2 charger, but these are what Google is officially selling, and they're great (if overpriced). The stand version is actually the same Pixelsnap charger, just with a robust stand to keep it propped up. The stand is stable, doesn't shift around, and you can charge the phone in landscape or portrait orientation. Photograph: Julian Chokkattu dbrand Prism 2.0 Screen Protector Dbrand gives you two screen protectors in this package, and it comes with a super-easy application tool. Wipe down your phone with the included alcohol wipe, dry it with the microfiber, and then place the tool over your phone and pull the pull tab. Press down on the line, wait 30 seconds, and then take the tool off. There's a squeegee to push out air bubbles. If you don't want to spend this much, Spigen's GlasTR tempered glass protectors are also easy to apply and cost $20 for a two-pack . Photograph: Julian Chokkattu Nomad 65W Slim Power Adapter Google's latest Pixel 10 series supports 29W and 39W charging speeds, depending on the model. That makes this 65W a little overkill, but I still think it's a great all-around charging adapter to carry with you. It's incredibly slim and lightweight, has folding prongs, and includes two USB-C ports. When you have two devices plugged in, one port will dish out 45W and the other will deliver 20W. The former will let you hit the fastest charging speeds possible on any of your Pixel devices. The Pixel Ecosystem If you buy a Pixel phone, there's a good chance you're interested in Google's other Pixel hardware. Good news: They're pretty great. The Pixel Buds Pro 2 are excellent earbuds, and the Pixel Watch 4 is the Android smartwatch to beat. Photograph: Julian Chokkattu Denoted as the “Best Earbuds for Android” in our Best Wireless Earbuds guide , the Pixel Buds Pro 2 (9/10, WIRED Recommends) are wonderfully small and compact, with a fun, egg-shaped case that has a lovely matte texture. They pair well with Android devices, have wireless charging, and include excellent noise-cancelling. You can also tap and hold the buds to talk to the Gemini voice assistant, and a recent software update added Loud Noise Protection and Adaptive Audio, the latter of which dynamically reduces the volume of unwanted sounds like sirens. You can even nod to answer a call or shake to decline! If you don't want to spend as much, there's also the Pixel Buds 2a ($129) , which are even smaller and have many of the same features, though there's no wireless charging in the case. Photograph: Julian Chokkattu Photograph: Julian Chokkattu Photograph: Julian Chokkattu Photograph: Julian Chokkattu The Pixel Watch 4 (8/10, WIRED Recommends) works with all Android phones, and it's a natural fit with a Pixel phone. This smartwatch will relay any app notifications you want to see on your wrist, and you can even check your Nest security cameras via the Google Home app. You can raise your wrist to talk to the Gemini assistant, no hot word needed, and there's a robust suite of health and fitness tracking capabilities that go toe-to-toe with the Apple Watch . Battery life is solid too, lasting about a day and a half with the 45-mm model, and it recharges incredibly fast. You can opt for the cellular version if you want always-on connectivity even away from your phone, though you'll need to pay up for a separate watch data plan. Read our Best Smartwatches guide for other options. Our Favorite Pixel Software Features Pixels have many great software features, but some need to be toggled on. It can also be hard to remember that all these features exist, so here are most of the top ones. There are some key features on Pixels that you won't find on any other Android phone. Some of these are available only on select Pixels—the Tensor chip started with the Pixel 6, and currently, the Tensor G4 is in the Pixel 9 range. Here's a breakdown: Call Screen: When you get a call from an unknown number, Google Assistant will scan and flag it if it's suspected spam or a robocall. If it's simply a number you don't recognize, you can have Assistant take the call. You'll see a real-time transcription of what's happening, so you can end the call right away if it's a telemarketer or answer if it turns out to be a long-lost high school friend. If it's someone important, you can give Assistant responses to recite if you're unable to take the call—it offers up contextual replies now, too. Remember to turn it on by opening up the dialer app and heading to Settings (three dots on the top right) > Spam and Call Screen .",https://www.wired.com/story/best-google-pixel-phone,Technology,BBC,Julian Chokkattu,"https://media.wired.com/photos/68a7a913ababd253d6b1768f/191:100/w_1280,c_limit/Google%20Pixel%2010%20Series%20SOURCE%20Julian%20Chokkattu.jpg",2020-12-07T14:00:00+00:00,47acf7ff41b98d6946fdb0a152105b9ec335e29f
fb02e2a83fa8,UK Watchdog Targets Google Search in Competition Crackdown,"business, google, uk, competition, search engines, regulation","“The decision to formally designate Google with Strategic Market Status is an important step to improving competition in digital markets,” argues Rocio Concha, director of policy and advocacy at UK consumer watchdog Which?. “Online search is evolving as gen AI tools become more widely used, but the CMA must still act to tackle the harmful dominance Google has now and to promote competition between gen AI search tools.” The CMA claims that Google Search accounts for more than 90 percent of all general search queries in the UK, and that over 200,000 firms in the UK collectively spent more than £10 billion ($13.3 billion) on Google search advertising in 2024. “Designating Google with SMS enables us to consider proportionate, targeted interventions to ensure that general search services are open to effective competition, and that consumers and businesses that rely on Google can have confidence that they are treated fairly,” the CMA decision report reads. In a statement shared with WIRED in response to the CMA’s decision, Google’s senior director of competition Oliver Bethell said that many of the ideas for interventions raised in this process would “inhibit UK innovation and growth, potentially slowing product launches at a time of profound AI-based innovation.” It continued: “Others pose direct harm to businesses, with some warning that they may be forced to raise prices for customers.” This is not a surprising response, says Greg Dowell, senior competition knowledge lawyer at law firm Macfarlanes. “I think we can expect Google and all the other big tech firms that are being subjected to these new rules to try and defend their practices on the basis that they are pro-consumer,” says Dowell. “Ultimately it is natural that Google and other firms in this position don’t want to be constrained in what they can do when it comes to new product development.” The new regulation will also affect Google Search’s “News” tab and its “Top Stories” carousel, as well as Google Discover. Google News, the company’s stand-alone news product, and AI chatbot Gemini are not affected, the CMA says. Dowell claims that implementing this roadmap might take a number of months. “The CMA may go further than the EU has done with the [Digital Markets Act] , particularly with regards to restrictions relating to Google’s AI services and how they’re integrated into Google search,” he explains. “The CMA essentially has a huge degree of flexibility in the interventions that it can seek to impose, and so it can continually react to developments as they occur. So that’s one benefit of the UK digital markets regulation regime, particularly when you compare it to the situation in the EU, where these sorts of rules are fixed in the regulation itself.”",https://www.wired.com/story/uk-watchdog-targets-google-search-in-competition-crackdown,Technology,BBC,Natasha Bernal,"https://media.wired.com/photos/68e8e5813a29a338be03a173/191:100/w_1280,c_limit/GettyImages-2210074784.jpg",2025-10-10T14:16:09.281000+00:00,7056b61555c2bc6ee3a97196dbdeac552212ac35
005590338054,The Best Vacuums for Pet Hair,"shopping, household, vacuum, robot vacuum, smart home, buying guides, cleaning, pets, vacuums","Compare Our Picks Others Tested Photograph: Molly Higgins Tineco Go Pet Cordless Vacuum for $219 : As when I tested the Tineco Go Mini ($110) for my handheld vacuums guide, I was a bit underwhelmed by this vacuum specifically for pets. It has a slot for easy brush removal if hair gets stuck around the bars, which is a helpful thing to have when you’re dealing with pet (and human) hair. The lever and the angle of the lid for emptying are counterintuitive, and the first few times I emptied it, the debris went everywhere. It’s hard to distinguish between eco and power modes, and the vac blinked red and the brush stopped rotating when transitioning between surfaces. (It especially had a hard time on my thin runner rug.) It felt a bit heavier and clunkier than others as well. But, it does have handy lights to illuminate debris and comes with attachments to make handheld cleaning a breeze. Photograph: Molly Higgins Mova P50 Pro Ultra Robot Vacuum for $999 : This robot vacuum-mop combo has extendable side brush and mop pads to reach tight corners, a self-emptying dock station that empties dust and debris, and self-cleans and dries mop pads. It also uses an RGB camera and “intelligent dirt detection system” whose sensors identify messes to clean deeper and avoid objects on the ground. The robovac generates 3D maps of your home, and identifies things like furniture and even pets. Through the app, you can customize cleanings, and there’s also synced video and voice interaction to allow you to talk to your pets, schedule cleanings, and more, and it is compatible with smart home devices Alexa and Google Home. When first mapping my small apartment, the vac didn’t want to go past certain rooms, and it took several days to get it to create a complete cleaning map. It has a hard time going over small thresholds, eventually avoiding cleaning the rooms altogether, and has thrown itself off my stairs twice, causing the mop pads to pop off. Despite having intelligent object detection, it still often tried to suck up or roll over small objects on the ground, like shoes and pet toys. I love that this combo vac-mop self-cleans and empties, but for nearly $1,000, I wish the smart features were smarter and the mapping was more accurate. Dyson Car + Boat Handheld Vacuum for $280 : While the Humdinger is still my favorite handheld vacuum, it seems to be dwindling in availability and is being replaced with this new model. Former WIRED reviewer Brenda Stolyar liked this handheld vacuum, designed specifically for sucking up dirt and debris from your car and boat, plus bedding, furniture, and other awkward spaces. ( Read our full review here ). Hoover HL4 Pet Upright Vacuum Cleaner for £219 : While it is only available in the UK, Hoover’s HL4 successfully removed lots of cat hair from my home. I live with a trio of cats, two of them long-haired, so a powerful vacuum is essential. The HL4 is sadly corded (7.6 meters), but at around 240 air watts it was powerful enough to lift dust and hair that my lightweight cordless vac and robot vac had missed. The smart design easily converts into a portable vacuum, and it comes with a pet tool and crevice tool. The pet tool proved adept at lifting hair from the couch, stairs, and cat beds, though it didn’t quite have the grunt to remove every strand. There’s a handy vent to reduce suction for mats and blankets. The 1.2-liter bin is easy to remove and empty, though not without releasing a dust cloud, and the Anti-Twist floor head seems to collect considerably less tangled hair than other vacuums. — Simon Hill Not Recommended Photograph: Molly Higgins Eufy RoboVac 11S Max for $160 : Our esteemed competitors at places like The Strategist and Wirecutter loved this cheap robovac, so I bought one for myself before moving into my new apartment with two cats. And I have to say, I don't agree with them. Yes, this robovac is significantly cheaper than most others and has generally good ratings, but I have nothing nice to say about it besides that it is able to go under furniture and suck up pet hair I otherwise wouldn’t be able to. Its navigation system is random, it doesn't have an app (but it does come with a remote control to direct it to a specific spot or schedule cleanings), it’s loud, and it tends to be attracted to cords. It has extreme difficulty traversing even minor height differences, like the small panel of wood between the hallway and bathroom door. But most of all, it is needlessly hard to empty the bin, and nearly impossible to detangle all of the hair and fur from the bar or spinning brush beneath. There’s gross hair that will probably still be wrapped around the mechanism until the day I am put into the ground. This cursed thing will outlive us all, I fear. AccordionItemContainerButton I tested these pet hair vacuums for a week if not more (I’ve been using both the Dyson cordless and handheld for months now), and I’ve used them on nearly every surface in my house—including the cat trees and behind my two cats’ litter box . When testing began, I lived in a large house with three cats and a dog (more hair in a larger area), and for the latter half of testing, I lived with two cats in a small apartment (slightly less hair in a smaller area with less places for hair to hide). I also tested every attachment on problem areas like carpeted stairs, crevices of air vents, a high-pile rug, and hardwood floors. Not all pet hair vacuums are created alike, and they vary quite a bit in their effectiveness on different surfaces and with different attachments. I set these up, charged ’em, and vacuumed with them until they died, noting run time, power, effectiveness, and ease of emptying the bin and cleaning the filter. AccordionItemContainerButton It seems like a lot of brands will slap the words “pet hair” onto a product and market it as such without really specifying why or how it’s effective for pet hair. Of course, I tested those to see if they put their metaphorical vac mouths where their money was. On the flip side, I also tested some that were well rated for overall efficacy but not marketed toward pets—like the Roborock Saros 10R , a pricey robovac that uses AI mapping and can identify pets nearby and quiet its motor. Speaking of, vacuums and pets are inherently antithetical. Vacuums are a necessary evil to combat pet hair, but your pets will likely be scared of them. If my cat Basil had opposable thumbs, I know he’d be leaving hate comments on this article. Aside from the robovac picks (which for some reason my cats don’t mind), my cat Basil had a mild cardiac event each time I tested the other vacs on this list. So along with effectiveness and suction, I also took into consideration loudness, as well as how easy the product is to handle. Generally though, when shopping for a pet hair vacuum, look for suction power, bin capacity, attachments, and type of bristle or Motorbar—figure out what’s going to be doing the actual picking up of dust, dander, and pet hair. I found that conical bars like the ones on certain Dyson models work well to not get tangled, and dual brushes like on the Ryobi work together to effectively pick up more. Also read reviews from real people with real, furry pets, but know that no two pets are alike. Take into consideration what kind of shedder you live with, and what type of space needs cleaning; a robovac may not be best for a house with multiple flights of carpeted stairs.

1c287fa94924,The Best Folding Phones,"shopping, phones, smartphones, folding devices, android, buying guides","Other Folding Phones to Consider Samsung Galaxy Z Flip7 Photograph: Julian Chokkattu Samsung Galaxy Z Flip7 for $1,100 : Samsung's Galaxy Z Flip7 (7/10, WIRED Recommends) is a close second to Motorola's Razr Ultra. I liked the camera quality from Motorola's flip phone this year more than Samsung's—a big win for the Razr—but the Flip7 captures nice photos and offers better video quality, if that's your thing. Samsung's latest Flip has a larger front screen, though you still have to jump through a few hoops to make it useful. For example, you need to install an app called Multistar to add any app of your choosing to the cover screen. The phone also has a lackluster battery life, struggling to last a full day; the Razr Ultra still only lasts a day, but I didn't feel like I had to plug in as much. And it also gets a little too warm for my tastes when it's under load. It's a good flip phone, but I prefer Motorola's flagship this year. Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold Photograph: Julian Chokkattu Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold for $1,499 : The only reason to consider the Pixel 9 Pro Fold right now is if you see it on sale. Google's Pixel 10 Pro Fold is the newer, better handset . The 9 Pro Fold isn't as slim as the Galaxy Z Fold7 nor as lightweight, but it's still a svelte device with a large front screen that feels like a normal phone. The 8-inch inner screen is excellent, and the triple-camera system delivers great results, though not as great as the Pixel 9 Pro series . Read our Best Pixel Phones guide for more. Razr 2025 series Photograph: Julian Chokkattu Motorola Razr+ (2025) for $1,000 : There is technically a third phone in Motorola's latest Razr lineup: the Razr+ 2025. However, it's nearly identical to last year's Razr+ 2024 , with fresh colors and the improved IP48 rating and titanium-reinforced hinge. It sits in an awkward middle ground, though. It's not as affordable as the standard Razr, which offers a pretty nice experience for the money. But it's also not as flagship as the Razr Ultra. It is also the only one of the lineup without the ultrawide camera. I usually love telephoto zoom lenses, but ultrawides are so handy on flip phones for group selfies. If you're considering this model, it's also worth considering the Razr+ from 2024 , as you'll see some nice discounts on it throughout the year; it just lacks the reinforced hinge and IP48 rating. Galaxy Z Fold6 Photograph: Julian Chokkattu Samsung Galaxy Z Fold6 for $1,900 : The Galaxy Fold6 (7/10, WIRED Recommends) is the sixth-generation folding phone from Samsung and came out in 2024. In this version, Samsung added a wider front screen that feels like a normal smartphone, though not as wide as the Galaxy Z Fold7. I don't find multitasking as easy as on phones like the OnePlus Open, and the aspect ratio still restricts some apps from showing a multi-pane view, like Gmail, unless you rotate the phone to landscape. It may not be as easy to find now that it has a successor, but if you find it on sale for under $1,400, it's worth considering, especially since Samsung offers long software support. Galaxy Z Flip6 Photograph: Julian Chokkattu Samsung Galaxy Z Flip6 for $900 : Samsung's Galaxy Z Flip6 (7/10, WIRED Recommends) from 2024 might be a better buy than Samsung's Galaxy Z Flip7 FE —the new “budget” folding flip phone the company introduced alongside the flagship Flip7 and Fold7. That's because the Flip7 FE is a reskinned Flip6 with a Samsung Exynos processor instead of a Qualcomm chip. We haven't tested the FE yet, but you can probably find a decent deal on the Flip6 that might make it a better value than the Flip7 FE. Performance could even be a smidge better. Oppo Find N5 Flip for $1,264 : You can think of this as the spiritual successor to the OnePlus Open. (Both companies are owned by BBK Electronics.) Sadly, it isn't available in the US, UK, or Europe. It's the world's slimmest book-like foldable at just 3.6 millimeters thick when open. The displays are excellent, it has top-end specs like the Snapdragon 8 Elite processor at its heart, not to mention 80-watt wired charging for speedy top-ups. The cameras aren't as great, though, and Oppo's software is still clunky and buggy. Xiaomi Mix Flip for $899 : Xiaomi’s first flip phone has a lovely design with excellent displays inside and out, long battery life with fast charging, and flagship-level performance, which makes a nice change as flip phones often have middling specs. It also boasts a solid dual-lens camera, opting for telephoto instead of ultrawide alongside the capable main shooter, which is more useful for most folks. The software lets the party down a little; there’s no IP rating, and it is very pricey, but I had fun with this flip phone. — Simon Hill Power up with unlimited access to WIRED .

245ce6886632,The Best Smartwatches,"buying guides, shopping, smartwatches, wearables, apple watch, watches, wear os, fitness trackers","Other Smartwatches to Consider The number of smartwatches on the market is staggering. Here are a few other options I like. Tag Heuer Calibre E5 Photograph: Julian Chokkattu TAG Heuer Connected Calibre E5 for $1,900 : I got a chance to try TAG Heuer's new luxury smartwatch for a few days , and it's slick. The Calibre E5 feels like nothing else, with premium materials like sapphire crystal and ceramic bezels; it has a nice heft to it. TAG has switched from Google's Wear OS to its own proprietary operating system (TAG Heuer OS), so you won't be able to access the usual apps on this smartwatch. However, it works with Android or iPhone, routes your notifications through, and can track basic fitness activities. A software update will also bring sleep tracking. We'll be putting it through its paces soon, but if you have other TAG or luxury watches in your collection, you might not mind having one that can also be a little more functional. Apple Watch Series 10 Photograph: Adrienne So Apple Watch Series 10 for $329 : Thanks to watchOS 26 , the 2024 Series 10 (8/10, WIRED Recommends) has many of the same features as the new Series 11, like hypertension notifications and Sleep Score. It has a thinner and lighter design with a larger screen than prior models, and it even got blood oxygen sensing back via a software update in August 2025 . It's too bad this one still has the 18-hour battery life. Avoid paying anywhere close to MSRP for this watch. If you can find it for under $300, snag it. Google Pixel Watch 3. Photograph: Julian Chokkattu Google Pixel Watch 3 for $230 : The Pixel Watch 3 (8/10, WIRED Recommends) is seeing some steep discounts now that the Pixel Watch 4 is here. It's a great smartwatch, with the caveat that it's not repairable. (The newer model addresses that.) It features loss-of-pulse detection —cleared by the FDA for use in the US—which can be critical in saving someone’s life. Google also focused its fitness updates on running , enabling users to create custom runs and follow AI-powered run recommendations while getting feedback on cardio load—how hard your heart is working and whether it's appropriate for your body. I strongly recommend you go with the 45-mm model, which doesn't even feel that big. It simply delivers better battery life—just about 24 hours with the always-on display or a little more if you have it turned off. Apple Watch Ultra 2. Photograph: Julian Chokkattu Apple Watch Ultra 2 for $799 : The Watch Ultra 2 is still worth considering, just don't pay anywhere near MSRP; otherwise, you may as well buy the new Watch Ultra 3. It can last several days of use, and has many of the same great features as the latest model, including better mics to pick up your voice, an 86-decibel siren to alert your position to anyone nearby, and precise GPS to better track your hikes (plus help you find your way back with the Backtrack feature). The screen can display topographic maps, but you cannot view offline maps without an iPhone. Samsung's Galaxy Watch Ultra 2025. Photograph: Julian Chokkattu Samsung's Galaxy Watch Ultra 2025 for $650 : The 47-mm Galaxy Watch Ultra (7/10, WIRED Review) is the company's Apple Watch Ultra and Garmin competitor, and it's a solid first entry into the world of pricey, feature-rich, and powerful smartwatches designed for professional athletes. This is technically the 2025 model, which is identical to the 2024 version but comes with 64 GB of storage and in a new blue color . It lasts a little over two days on a charge because it's a big 47-mm watch and can pack a beefy battery. There's a titanium case and sapphire glass face, plus it's rated to 10 ATM and IP68, so you can submerge it up to 100 meters underwater. The heart rate tracker is remarkably consistent with the Apple Watch Ultra 2, and the dual-band GPS delivers accurate mapping. The software isn't as intuitive, and a few features are lacking when compared to other performance smartwatches, but this is a good start if you're in the world of Android. If you don't care for the blue or the extra storage, you can buy the 2024 model for hundreds less . Samsung Galaxy Watch7. Photograph: Julian Chokkattu Samsung Galaxy Watch7 44-mm for $190 : Samsung's Galaxy Watch7 from 2024 is a little plain. This model debuted Samsung's Energy Score and added updated sleep tracking capabilities. You also get FDA-cleared sleep apnea detection, though this isn't a feature you'll turn on all the time—it takes two nights to track, and afterward, you'll get a note saying whether or not you show symptoms. This feature, along with the electrocardiogram and irregular heart rhythm notifications, is only available when paired with a Samsung phone . Otherwise, this watch functions well with any other Android . You can choose from two sizes, plus Bluetooth-only or LTE. I tested both sizes and found battery life frustrating compared to its predecessors. With the always-on display, I struggled to hit 24 hours with two tracked activities and sleep tracking overnight. With it turned off, things fared a little better, but I was still barely hitting a full day. You'll have to baby the battery and utilize the power-saving modes. If you don't care for the latest and greatest, you can save a lot of dough with the Watch7. GPR-H1000. Photograph: Julian Chokkattu Casio G-Shock Master of G Rangeman GPR-H1000 for $500 : It's not for every event, but the Master of G-Land Rangeman ( GPRH1000RY1A ) looks great on my wrist, and I love that I only need to charge it about once a week. This is a G-Shock first and foremost. It has a durable, thick case and a comfortable strap. It's a big watch. It also has six sensors and a built-in GPS. Connect the watch to your smartphone via Casio's app, and you can get simple notification alerts, heart-rate tracking, activity tracking, and sleep tracking. That's without mentioning other features like blood oxygen monitoring, compass, world time, altimeter, and barometer. I've compared the results to an Apple Watch Series 10, and for the most part, core metrics like heart rate, step tracking, and sleep are similar. I have had some data not show up in the Casio app for a few days, and many of these functions are slow to load on the watch. This would not be my first choice if I wanted a fitness-focused wearable— get a Garmin instead —but I like the ability to look at and track some of these metrics whenever I want. More importantly, I like having a G-Shock around my wrist. Samsung Galaxy Watch FE for $240 : The Galaxy Watch FE is a fine budget Wear OS smartwatch. The 40-mm Galaxy Watch FE has a smaller screen that doesn't get as bright and sports a slower processor and a smaller battery compared to the Watch7 series. The health sensors are almost the same, and I got accurate results with heart rate and sleep tracking. The battery lasts just about a day, if not a little less. OnePlus Watch 2. Photograph: Julian Chokkattu OnePlus Watch 2 for $227 : This is last year's OnePlus smartwatch, but it's still available. It seems like a better value now that the OnePlus 3's price has been jacked up. The 46-mm OnePlus Watch 2 (7/10, WIRED Recommends) runs Wear OS and lasts roughly three days on a single charge, a little more if you enable some power-saving settings. The health capabilities are lacking—there's no fall detection or electrocardiogram—but there's sleep tracking, and it's pretty accurate. Some features, like heart-rate tracking, distance traveled, and steps, have mixed accuracy in my testing, which means you shouldn't buy this smartwatch if you're primarily using it for those functions. Also, consider the OnePlus Watch 2R , which you can snag for less cash. The differences are mostly around build quality. The screen doesn’t get as bright, it has an aluminum case instead of stainless steel, and there’s no sapphire crystal protecting the screen, so it’s less durable. However, this makes it lighter and more comfortable to wear. Withings ScanWatch 2. Courtesy of Withings Withings ScanWatch 2 for $370 : The ScanWatch 2 (7/10, WIRED Recommends) can pass for an analog watch. Its health-tracking feature set is comprehensive—you get heart rate monitoring, an electrocardiogram, blood oxygen measurements, and sleep tracking. Battery life is stellar too, as it can last up to 30 days with light use. (Heavier usage will see roughly 22 days before needing a charge.) The main problem is the tiny display on this watch, which is too small to read some notifications. The GPS is also connected, meaning it requires your phone to be tethered and nearby. There's an optional Health+ subscription, but we'd advise against it, as it doesn't offer much utility. The ScanWatch 2 comes in a 42-mm or 38-mm case size and doesn't have the rich features and apps you'll find on the likes of an Apple Watch, but if you want to monitor your health data—and you don't want your watch to look too techy—this will do the job.

6f3abc9b235f,Review: Proton VPN,"reviews, review, vpn, privacy, shopping","On average, Proton dropped about 15 percent of my unprotected speed, but that number needs some context. In a location like Atlanta, Georgia, midday on a Thursday, I experienced a drop of only around 3 percent. In Columbus, Ohio, in the evening on a Friday, that grew to a 25 percent drop. This type of variation is normal. Providers like Surfshark and NordVPN see similar variations and have similar speed drops on average. The difference for Proton is that I’ve yet to stumble upon a real stinker of a server. I’m sure they exist—with some 15,000+ servers, you’re bound to find one at some point—but I haven’t seen them after weeks of use. Windscribe and ExpressVPN are competitive with Proton on average, but they also have some locations where I saw anywhere from a 40 to 60 percent drop in speed. Those results aren’t indicative of the speed overall (you just swap to a different server), but Proton gets you there faster. That edge is likely due to Proton’s VPN Accelerator. I’ll admit, it sounded like nonsense. In the Proton VPN app, you’ll find a toggle for VPN Accelerator, which boldly claims to increase speed by up to 400 percent; not likely. Despite the speedup, I don’t think VPN Accelerator will reach anywhere near that quoted number, at least in the vast majority of cases. Still, there are some advantages, most notably, BBR. Bottleneck Bandwidth and Round-trip propagation time, or BBR, is a congestion control algorithm developed by Google that’s been deployed on YouTube and Google itself. Rather than limiting packet transfer when packets are lost, as most congestion control algorithms work, BBR models the network and estimates available bandwidth. It doesn’t need to see lost packets to kick in. Proton’s speeds aren’t entirely attributable to BBR, but I suspect it helps when connecting to servers over long distances. Connecting in the UK, for example, I saw an average speed loss of around 20 percent, which is much closer to my US results than it has any right to be.",https://www.wired.com/review/proton-vpn,Technology,BBC,Jacob Roach,"https://media.wired.com/photos/68e812cf70ea786fe8dfa1c9/191:100/w_1280,c_limit/ProtonVPN-iPhone-2-Credit-Jacob-Roach.jpg",2025-10-10T07:30:00-04:00,6754444180a3c687de1d6c60e4f82de61dca4eb1
ed6e22df6362,"The viral 'Chicago Rat Hole' wasn't actually made by a rat, scientists claim",,"A rat-shaped indent on a Chicago sidewalk went viral early last year, with troves of people venturing to the hole bearing coins and other offerings. However, a new study suggests the so-called ""Chicago Rat Hole"" wasn't actually made by a rat — it was probably the imprint of a squirrel. By comparing characteristics of the hole with information about the local rodent populations, researchers determined that a squirrel most likely made the impression. The study was published Wednesday (Oct. 15) in the journal Biology Letters . ""Just like everyone else, I looked at it like, 'Yep, that's a rat,'"" study lead author Michael Granatosky , an evolutionary biomechanist at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville, told Live Science. ""But just assuming something is not the best way to actually do science."" The hole, a well-preserved imprint of a rodent's death in wet concrete, was around for decades before it went viral. It became a tourist attraction in 2024 after the Chicago-based artist and comedian Winslow Dumaine posted about its existence on the social platform X. ""Squirrels are a lot more TV-ready than rats are,"" Dumaine told Live Science. ""But I do think the fact it was dubbed a rat hole was a key part in why it became popular."" As the researchers came across pictures of the hole on social media, some felt it didn't look ""super rat-like,"" senior study author Edwin Dickinson , an archaeologist at the University of Calgary, told Live Science. It also seemed unlikely a rat could have made such a cast on wet concrete without also leaving footprints leading up to it. These suspicions drove researchers to analyze the hole more deeply. Using the citizen science app iNaturalist, which catalogues local fauna, the study authors identified possible animals that could have made the hole. They knew, from the indent, that it had to be an animal with four legs, five-clawed feet and a tail. Get the world’s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox. Then, it was all a matter of proportion. The study authors didn't have a chance to measure the hole itself, which city officials removed in April 2024, citing the disturbance crowds were bringing to the Roscoe Village neighborhood. However, they were able to get precise measurements thanks to the many pictures people had posted of the imprint alongside coins and other items. The researchers compared their measurements to specimens at the American Museum of Natural History. A statistical analysis of this data showed a 98.7% likelihood the hole was made by either an eastern grey squirrel ( Sciurus carolinensis ) or a fox squirrel ( Sciurus niger ) . In light of this finding, the scientists suggested rechristening the rat hole as the ""Windy City Sidewalk Squirrel"" to better represent its origins. The authors hope the study will help people see the fun in science. ""The rat hole might be the medium, but the idea that we're hoping to perpetuate in this study is… there's nothing too inherently complicated or scary about following the scientific method,"" Dickinson said. ""It is something that we can all use in our lives.""",https://www.livescience.com/animals/land-mammals/the-viral-chicago-rat-hole-wasnt-actually-made-by-a-rat-scientists-claim,Science,BBC,,https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vfN5ZFJ3YGR3B67gyWVRNC-1920-80.jpg,2025-10-14T23:01:00+00:00,36fd6d3a1f360c3e8ed52ff281e2b438338a15eb
869eef876444,Haunting image of a rare hyena lurking in a ghost town wins 2025 Wildlife Photographer of the Year award,,"A haunting scene of a brown hyena in front of a long-abandoned building. (Image credit: Wim van den Heever (South Africa)/ Wildlife Photographer of the Year ) An eerie image of a brown hyena ( Parahyaena brunnea ) prowling the ruins of an abandoned diamond mining town in Namibia has won this year's Wildlife Photographer of the Year competition. The haunting scene, titled 'Ghost Town Visitor,' shows the world's rarest hyena standing in front of a long-deserted building lit with an ethereal glow. To capture it, photographer Wim Van den Heever set up camera traps in the ghost town of Kolmanskop after discovering hyena tracks there nearly a decade ago. ""I spent several seasons trying to photograph them at dawn and dusk from nearby buildings, but without success,"" van den Heever told Live Science in an email. ""Eventually, I turned to camera traps, carefully positioning them where hyenas might pass. After nearly a decade of patience and persistence, I finally captured the image — a brown hyena wandering through the silent ruins."" Brown hyenas, also known as strandwolves , are identified by their shaggy brown coats, pointed ears and distinctive manes. Their global population is estimated to be as few as 4,000 individuals , which are primarily found in the arid regions of Namibia, Botswana and parts of South Africa. Brown hyenas are known to pass through Kolmanskop while travelling to hunt for Cape fur seal pups or scavenge for carrion washed ashore along the Namib Desert coast, according to a statement released by the competition organizers. ""For years, I'd noticed brown hyena tracks and droppings in the ghost town of Kolmanskop near Lüderitz, and I knew they roamed its eerie, sand-filled streets,"" van den Heever said. ""It became my dream to capture one moving through this haunting, abandoned place."" The photograph was also awarded first place in the Urban Wildlife category. ""You get a prickly feeling just looking at this image and you know that you're in this hyena's realm, "" Kathy Moran , Chair of the Wildlife Photographer of the Year Jury said in the statement. ""I also love the twist on this interpretation of 'urban' — it was once but is no longer a human-dominated environment."" Get the world’s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox. Now in its 61st year, the competition, staged by the Natural History Museum in London, received its highest number of entries ever this year — a record-breaking total of 60,636 entries from 113 countries and territories. Here are some of our favorites. Qingrong Yang (China) perfects photographic timing to show a ladyfish snatching its prey from right under this little egret’s beak.

Once a stagnant, polluted port in China , the lake has been transformed into a thriving ecosystem thanks to an engineering project reconnecting it to the sea. The stunning photograph took the top prize in the Birds category. Dennis Stogsdill (USA) witnesses a caracal hunting a lesser flamingo in the Serengeti National Park, Tanzania. (Image credit: Dennis Stogsdill (USA)/ Wildlife Photographer of the Year ) This captivating image of a lesser flamingo ( Phoeniconaias minor ) in the jaws of a predatory wildcat known as a caracal ( Caracal caracal ) at the Serengeti National Park in Tanzania, won the Mammal Behavior category. ""The story of this image is one of unplanned luck,"" photographer Dennis Stogsdill told Live Science in an email. ""We had received a call of a serval [ Leptailurus serval ] near the lake and we rushed over to view only because a friend wanted to see one."" But when Stogsdill arrived at the scene, he was met by a caracal instead. ""Just moments later it began to stalk the flamingoes,"" he said. ""So, while most wildlife photography involves immense patience and planning this was about as lucky as one can get."" Caracals are primarily nocturnal, meaning that seeing one hunting flamingoes in broad daylight is exceptionally rare — a behavior that has likely never been captured before, Stogsdill added.

640208bcb0a4,Astronomers spot the most powerful and distant 'odd radio circle' ever seen,,"With help from citizen scientists, astronomers have spotted the most powerful ""odd radio circle"" (ORC) yet. The discovery could give astronomers a better understanding of how these unusual objects — and the galaxies they encircle — form. ""ORCs are among the most bizarre and beautiful cosmic structures we've ever seen — and they may hold vital clues about how galaxies and black holes co-evolve, hand in hand,"" Ananda Hota , founder of the RAD@home Astronomy Collaboratory and co-author of a new paper describing the findings, said in a statement . ORCs were first described in 2019 by a team using the Australian Square Kilometer Array Pathfinder. They are essentially gigantic, faint rings of plasma that appear to surround certain galaxies and emit radio waves . To date, only around a dozen of these enormous objects — most of which are 10 to 20 times the size of the Milky Way — have been found. But researchers think the newly discovered ORC may offer some clues about how these cosmic behemoths form. This ORC is unique for a couple of reasons. First, it is made of not just one, but two rings interlocked like a Venn diagram. This is only the second time astronomers have observed such a configuration. Second, it is the most distant and powerful ORC found to date. Researchers detailed their findings in a paper published Oct. 2 in the journal Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society . The new rings were first flagged by citizen scientists taking part in the RAD@home Astronomy Collaboratory, an international citizen science research platform originally founded in India. The rings were then confirmed by a team of astronomers using the Low-Frequency Array (LOFAR), a series of radio telescopes spread across mainland Europe, and dubbed RAD J131346.9+500320. ""The fact that citizen scientists uncovered them highlights the continued importance of human pattern recognition, even in the age of machine learning,"" Pratik Dabhade , an astronomer at the National Center for Nuclear Research in Poland and co-author of the new paper, said in the statement. Previous research suggested that ORCs could form when supermassive black holes crash into one another, sending out cosmic shock waves. But RAD J131346.9+500320's twin rings center around a jet-like filament of gas. Based on this structure, Dabhade and his team propose that it may have been shaped by ""super winds"" flowing from the spiral galaxies it contains. This may hold true for other ORCs as well, though more research is needed to say for sure. Get the world’s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox. In addition to RAD J131346.9+500320, the paper details two other objects found in collaboration with the RAD@home Astronomy Collaboratory: a galaxy 3 million light-years across that's surrounded by a radio ring, and another galaxy with a ring around one of its massive jets. Future research from LOFAR and other telescopes, such as the Vera C. Rubin Observatory in Chile, may help reveal more about these structures.",https://www.livescience.com/space/astronomy/astronomers-spot-the-most-powerful-and-distant-odd-radio-circle-ever-seen,Science,BBC,,https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jSmvbNZeqKcTjbDv39DKLD-1920-80.jpg,2025-10-14T16:59:50+00:00,28ab682c1abefc5141c057d321cb460963072340
762d1ab5c8cd,"A massive weak spot in Earth's magnetic field is growing, scientists discover",,"A weak spot in Earth's magnetic field over the South Atlantic Ocean has ballooned in size since 2014, satellite data reveals. The region, known as the South Atlantic Anomaly, has grown by an area nearly half the size of continental Europe, sprouting a lobe in the direction of Africa where the field is weakening the fastest. And the anomaly, linked to mysterious fluctuations near Earth's outer core, could pose a risk to satellites passing over the region, according to a study published in the November issue of the journal Physics of the Earth and Planetary Interiors . ""The South Atlantic Anomaly is not just a single block,"" study lead author Chris Finlay , a professor of geomagnetism at the Technical University of Denmark, said in a statement . ""It's changing differently towards Africa than it is near South America. There's something special happening in this region that is causing the field to weaken in a more intense way."" Researchers first detected the South Atlantic Anomaly in the 19th century. Inside its boundaries, the magnetic field that radiates away from Earth's interior dips down to an altitude of about 120 miles (200 kilometers) above the planet's surface, which is much lower than the field's average altitude of about 400 miles (650 km) . This poses a threat to satellites and other spacecraft. Earth's magnetic field shields the planet and objects in low Earth orbit from charged solar particles and incoming X-ray and ultraviolet radiation, so spacecraft traveling over the South Atlantic Anomaly are exposed to more of these impacts. This could lead to malfunctions or damage in hardware, and even blackouts, according to the statement. Finlay and his colleagues think the South Atlantic Anomaly is growing and spreading eastward due to strange fluxes at the limit between Earth's mantle and outer core, the layers of the planet sandwiched between Earth's crust and inner core. Get the world’s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox. Earth's magnetic field is largely generated by the planet's liquid outer core. (Image credit: Mopic/Shutterstock) Earth's magnetic field is largely generated by Earth's outer core — an ocean of swirling, molten iron located roughly 1,900 miles (3,000 km) beneath the planet's surface. The liquid iron dynamo generates electrical currents, and their flow induces a magnetic field that spreads up into the mantle and extends through Earth's atmosphere, forming two giant rings that join near the poles. Scientists previously found that in some areas beneath the South Atlantic Anomaly, the magnetism generated by the outer core is looping back into the core instead of coming out. These patterns, known as reverse flux patches, can migrate and expand, explaining the growth of the South Atlantic Anomaly over the past 11 years, Finlay said. “We can see one of these areas moving westward over Africa, which contributes to the weakening of the South Atlantic Anomaly [the magnetic field] in this region,"" he added. Two areas where Earth's magnetic field is particularly strong, Canada and Siberia, have experienced changes over the past decade. (Image credit: ESA (Data source: Finlay, C.C. et al., 2025)) The scientists spotted the unusual shifts in data from the European Space Agency ’s (ESA's) ongoing Swarm mission, which uses three identical satellites to measure magnetic signals originating from Earth's interior and oceans. The data also revealed changes in magnetic field dynamics above Canada and Siberia, where magnetism has appeared more intense than average since Swarm began its observations in 2013. Since 2014, the magnetic field above Canada has weakened slightly, and the magnetic field above Siberia has strengthened, the new study shows. The strong region over Canada has shrunk by an area nearly the size of India, while the strong region over Siberia has grown by an area the size of Greenland.

371401254e9c,New hydrogen battery can operate four times colder than before — meaning denser and longer-lasting EV batteries,,"Future electric cars could ditch lithium-ion batteries , thanks to a new breakthrough in hydrogen energy storage at much lower temperatures than was previously possible. Researchers from Tokyo’s Institute of Science created a hydrogen battery that uses magnesium hydride as the anode and hydrogen gas as the cathode, and a solid-state electrolyte with a crystal structure. In a study published Sept. 18 in the journal Science , the scientists noted that this battery can operate at 194 degrees F (90 degrees C), rather than the 572-752 F (300-400 degrees C) operating temperatures needed for current solid-state hydrogen storage methods. ""These properties of our hydrogen storage battery were previously unattainable through conventional thermal methods or liquid electrolytes, offering a foundation for efficient hydrogen storage systems suitable for use as energy carriers,"" said lead author of the study Takashi Hirose , associate professor in Kyoto University's Institute of Chemical Research (ICR), in a statement . Hydrogen batteries with solid-state components already exist, as do hydrogen fuel cells. The former, however, require high operating temperatures while the latter struggle to be as efficient as lithium-ion batteries, as well as struggling to store hydrogen gas under high pressure. But with this new hydrogen battery, the scientists achieved full theoretical storage capacity of the MgH 2 anode and high ionic conductivity at room temperature. Solid foundation The core of this hydrogen battery lies in its solid electrolyte. Formed of barium, calcium and sodium hydride, the electrolyte has a crystal-like structure that offers both high electrochemical stability and high ionic conductivity, specifically when it comes to hydrogen ions, at relatively low temperatures. In operation, the battery functions much like a lithium-ion one, except that rather than positively charged ions moving through the electrolyte, this new battery uses hydride ions that carry a negative charge and can pass through its crystal structure. Get the world’s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox. When delivering power (discharging), the hydrogen gas in the cathode goes through a chemical reaction that reduces it to hydride ions that move through the electrolyte to the magnesium anode, where they oxidise to form MgH 2 . In this state, oxidation-reduction reactions (redox) take place, causing the negatively charged anode to lose electrons. These flow across an external circuit to the cathode, which now has a net positive charge — and in doing so, delivers power to connected devices or systems. The reverse happens when charging, with an external power source invoking redox. Here, the MgH 2 anode releases hydride ions that pass through the electrode to then be oxidised at the hydrogen electrode to form hydrogen gas. As such, electrons flow from the H 2 electrode to the Mg one until the reduction reaction can no longer occur, meaning the battery is in a fully charged state. With this battery design, hydrogen gas can be stored and released in a solid-state cell on demand, with a capacity of 2,030mAh per gram (for reference, lithium-ion batteries tend to have a cpacitiy of 154 to 203mAh per gram , while some of the best phones have lithium-ion battery capacities of 5,000mAh for the whole cell). While the operating temperature sits just below the boiling point of water, meaning such a battery isn’t ready for use in everyday electronic items like smartphones or laptops, there’s scope for it to pave the way for more efficient and easier hydrogen storage. This, in turn, could see electric vehicles adopt hydrogen batteries rather than lithium-ion batteries, which are heavy and suffer from degradation as well as declining efficiency over their lifetime. Better hydrogen storage without the need for high-pressure systems, extreme cooling or high operating temperatures could further open up hydrogen’s use as a green power source. That's because it could offer less of a carbon footprint than fossil fuels and current hydrogen-based power systems. Hydrogen has often been touted as one of the ways to transition towards green energy, although its production, storage and use in power delivery systems has remained a niche activity. If scaled up and put into production, this battery breakthrough could continue to propel hydrogen as a fuel of the future.",https://www.livescience.com/technology/electric-vehicles/new-hydrogen-battery-can-operate-four-times-colder-than-before-meaning-denser-and-longer-lasting-ev-batteries,Science,BBC,,https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jqVhjhSdjZHnA3T8ZmC98Z-1600-80.jpg,2025-10-14T11:30:00+00:00,a4ed268e0666592bfe5ddcc9f2302fbd1a20153c

Yarlung Zangbo River, Tibet Autonomous Region of China [ 29.2814054, 91.3256581 ] What's in the photo? The braided branches of a river winding through the Tibetan Plateau Which satellite took the photo? Landsat 9 When was it taken? Feb. 8, 2025 This striking satellite photo shows a particularly convoluted section of a record-breaking ""braided river"" in China , which drastically changes shape every year and could become more unstable over the coming decades due to climate change. The Yarlung Zangbo River is a roughly 1,250-mile-long (2,000 kilometers) waterway that stretches from its origin at a glacier in the eastern Tibetan Plateau all the way into India. It is the longest river in Tibet, as well as the fifth longest in China, and holds the record for being the highest major river on Earth, flowing at an average elevation of 4,000 meters (13,000 feet) above sea level, according to NASA's Earth Observatory . The photographed section of the river is located in Zhanang County, just before it passes through the world's deepest land-based canyon and its namesake, the Yarlung Tsangpo Grand Canyon , which is more than 6,000 meters (20,000 feet) deep — or three times deeper than Arizona's Grand Canyon. Yarlung Zangbo is a classic example of a braided river — a waterway with ""multi-threaded channels that branch and merge to create the characteristic braided pattern,"" with mid-channel sandbars that are ""formed, consumed, and re-formed continuously,"" according to the National Park Service . This section is where the most braiding occurs anywhere along the river, with up to 20 channels across at certain points in the image. Related: See all the best images of Earth from space Yarlung Zangbo is one of the best examples of a braided river anywhere on Earth. Its channels shift so frequently that nothing can grow on its temporary sandbars. (Image credit: VCG/VCG via Getty Images) Yarlang Zangbo's extreme braiding is caused by heavy sediment deposits from the steep slopes of the adjacent Himalayas, which are washed into the river and help carve new channels into the ground, Zoltán Sylvester , a geologist at the University of Texas at Austin, told the Earth Observatory. The river changes shape so often that no vegetation can fully grow on the sandbars that sporadically appear between the river's braids, he added. Get the world’s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox. You can see how quickly the river changes shape for yourself in a 37-year timelapse animation, which shows annual satellite images of this spot taken between 1988 to 2025 by Landsat 5, Landsat 8 and Landsat 9 (see below). Eagle-eyed viewers may also be able to spot a narrow bridge, which was constructed over the shapeshifting waterway in 2014. (It's visible as a thin line near the far right-hand side of the animation). Satellite images captured between 1988 and 2025 show how the river's many channels change shape on a yearly basis. (Image credit: NASA/Landsat mission) The river starts at the Angsi Glacier, emerging from a stream of meltwater that flows from the ice mass. However, this was only officially confirmed in 2011, according to Chinese state media . Before this, there was confusion among scientists about whether the river actually originated from a meltwater stream coming from the nearby Chemayungdung Glacier. Like many other Himalayan ice masses , the Angsi Glacier has lost a significant amount of water in recent decades due to human-caused climate change. The resulting meltwater has caused more sediment to be deposited into the river, which can increase erosion and make it more likely for its banks to collapse. According to a 2024 study that analyzed satellite photos of the 13 major rivers in the Tibetan Plateau, this poses a risk to local ecosystems, infrastructure and landscape stability. When the river eventually reaches India, it becomes part of the Brahmaputra River and continues for another 1,800 miles (2,900 km) until it reaches the Ganges River Delta, where it drains into the Indian Ocean, according to the Earth Observatory.",https://www.livescience.com/planet-earth/rivers-oceans/shapeshifting-braided-river-in-tibet-is-the-highest-in-the-world-and-is-becoming-increasingly-unstable-earth-from-space,Science,BBC,,https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/a5K2qGJpJzLpDRpcmfb8SB-1600-80.jpg,2025-10-14T07:00:00+00:00,d934551b0199f43c76ef2d6fb4e1dca168903259
b5613dcb9ffc,Mysterious chunks of DNA called 'inocles' could be hiding in your mouth,,"Scientists have discovered huge, mysterious pieces of DNA in the oral microbiome — the population of bacteria and other microbes living in our mouths — and they say this giant DNA might influence the human immune system. It's well known that we have plenty of bacteria in our mouths and that these microbes can have both positive and negative impacts on our oral and overall health. Now, in a study published Aug. 11 in the journal Nature Communications , researchers report a previously undiscovered feature of the oral microbiome: giant pieces of bacterial DNA that separate from the microbes' main genome. Moreover, these pieces of DNA are associated with changes in the body's immune system and even the occurrence of certain types of cancer, the team found. The study provides a ""new puzzle piece that is a step in understanding the oral microbiome, human health, and human disease,"" Floyd Dewhirst , a professor at the ADA Forsyth Institute who was not involved in the research, told Live Science in an email. Microbiome studies , which have flourished in the past decade, have shown that the microbiomes across the body play major roles in human health and disease. Researchers have identified the types and proportions of different microbial species that live in places like our mouths and guts , and then used that data to see how differences in those features are linked to our health. Over the years, the genomes of these species have been studied extensively but conventional genetic analyses have not yet been able to explain all of the links between our microbiome and overall health status. Researchers in the Yutaka Suzuki lab at the University of Tokyo wanted to explore these missing data and were inspired by the recent discovery of giant extrachromosomal elements (ECEs) in bacteria living in soil. ECEs are pieces of DNA that are separate from an organism's main genome. In humans, our mitochondrial DNA — stored in the powerhouses of our cells — is an ECE. In bacteria, a commonly known small ECE is called a plasmid. Get the world’s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox. Lead study author Yuya Kiguchi , who is now a researcher at Stanford University, and his colleagues in the Suzuki lab predicted that giant ECEs could be found in bacteria living in places other than soil. ""Maybe many of these giant extra chromosomal elements are found in the environment, the microbiome field, or pathogens,"" Kiguchi told Live Science. ""But we don't know any examples of this kind of giant extra chromosomal element from the commensal [human] microbiome."" Commensal microbes are those that live symbiotically in or on the human body. Using saliva samples from hundreds of people, the researchers found, for the first time, that giant ECEs also exist in our oral microbiome. The research team named these giant pieces of DNA ""inocles;"" the name stands for "" in sertion sequence encoded; o ral origin; cir cle genomic structure."" They also found that approximately 74% of people in their study possessed these inocles in their oral microbiome. So why is this the first time inocles have been discovered? Most genetic experiments in bacteria use short-read DNA sequencing methods. This involves cutting a cell's DNA into smaller pieces, reading their code, and then assembling the bits into a full genome using a computer. While this method of sequencing can easily detect small ECEs, like typical bacterial plasmids, inocles are too large and complex for short-read sequencing to spot. Using long-read DNA sequencing — a costlier and more time consuming method in which much larger pieces of DNA are sequenced and stitched together — the scientists could identify these large chunks of extrachromosomal DNA in the bacteria of human saliva samples. By correlating those results with blood samples from the same people, they also found that differences in the levels of inocles is associated with differences in the immune system, including the immune response to certain bacterial and viral infections. Sixty-eight people in the study had either a type of head and neck or colorectal cancer, and these individuals had lower levels of inocles in their oral microbiomes compared with the people without these cancers. That raises the possibility of using these newly discovered giant chunks of DNA as future biomarkers for cancer, the study authors suggested. As a next step, the researchers aim to grow these inocles in the lab so they can further investigate their function and how they can spread between bacteria and people. ""Now that we know that inocles exist, we can try and figure out their functions and potential roles in health and disease,"" Dewhirst said.",https://www.livescience.com/health/mysterious-chunks-of-dna-called-inocles-could-be-hiding-in-your-mouth,Science,BBC,,https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/wsQXhZ8zqgk9wBjQjgfW6K-1920-80.jpg,2025-10-13T17:00:00+00:00,89d48f8cc7dee1387585214c6dcd9c40b434e6b7
99d07ea7a42b,Link between Cascadia and San Andreas Fault earthquakes discovered 30 years after lost vessel stumbled across key data,,"A ""Big One"" on the Cascadia subduction zone in the Pacific Northwest might trigger a similarly serious earthquake on California's San Andreas Fault , new research suggests. The findings are based on sediments taken from the seabed off the coast of Cape Mendocino, California and offshore Oregon. It's at Cape Mendocino that California's famous San Andreas fault ends and the Cascadia subduction zone begins. These are two very different fault systems, but the sediment record suggests that in the past, at least three San Andreas earthquakes have happened within hours to a couple of days after large Cascadia quakes. Another seven or so may have occurred within decades to years or less. There are uncertainties in the dating and records, however. But if the two fault systems are, in fact, synchronized, it could be a real problem for disaster relief, said study first author Chris Goldfinger , a paleoseismologist and professor emeritus at Oregon State University. ""Having these things side by side would really be a tough one,"" Goldfinger told Live Science. ""There'd be not enough resources to respond to even one of these very well, and two of them would be really difficult."" Earthquake potential Cascadia can create extremely powerful earthquakes. Famously, in 1700, the region experienced a quake thought to be between magnitude 8.7 and 9.2 that sent destructive tsunami waves all the way to Japan. These quakes are caused by movement of three oceanic plates (the Explorer, the Juan de Fuca, and the Gorda) slipping beneath the North American continent. The San Andreas Fault, on the other hand, is a strike-slip fault where rock masses on either side of the fault move past each other horizontally.. The largest known quake on the northern San Andreas was the 1906 San Francisco earthquake of approximately magnitude 7.9. Because the fault runs through densely populated areas, it could do a great deal of damage, as in the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake that killed 63 people. Get the world’s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox. The two fault systems meet off the coast of Mendocino in an area known as the ""triple junction."" Goldfinger and his colleagues were on a research cruise in 1999 drilling core samples from the ocean floor in Cascadia, looking for signs of ancient earthquakes. When large earthquakes happen on land, they can trigger underwater flows of sand and sediment known as turbidites. Turbidites follow a pattern where coarse sediment settles out of the water first, creating a layer. Finer sands and silt follow, forming another layer. On that cruise, however, a mix-up led to the ship traveling 60 miles from where they'd meant to be. The scientists, who were trying to nap between working, didn't realize the error until the ship arrived. ""I was just like, 'Oh no, we’re like halfway to San Francisco,'"" Goldfinger remembers. He decided to take a core sample in that spot anyway. When the team later analyzed the sample, they realized it contained a mystery. The turbidites in the sample didn't have the coarse layer on the bottom and the finer layer on top, as was typical. ""This original core of the San Andreas had deposits that looked like they were upside-down,"" Goldfinger said. ""The sand was at the top."" Upside-down evidence The researchers had no explanation for this flip-flopped pattern. Nor, at first, did they have an explanation for another strange mystery of these offshore samples: Cores taken south of the triple junction, in the realm of the northern San Andreas, seemed to show earthquakes that matched eerily well to the timing of earthquakes taken north of the triple junction in Cascadia. In the last 1,300 years, they found, there were 18 likely earthquake-generated turbidites in Cascadia and 19 offshore from the northern San Andreas. Ten of those appeared to be deposited within 50 to 100 years of each other. Core samples indicate that at least three earthquakes at the Cascadia subduction zone were followed by events at the San Andreas Fault within just hours or days. (Image credit: Chris Goldfinger) Even weirder, in three cases, the coarse sand of the upper layer of these flip-flopped turbidites was mixed into the finer sand of the lower layer, suggesting the upper layer had settled while the bottom layer was still in motion. That would mean that the two layers were deposited within hours to days of one another. These three events included the 1700 Cascadia quake, as well as quakes 1,200 years ago and 1,500 years ago. It took many years to conduct additional radiocarbon dating, gather corresponding earthquake records from other sources like lakebeds in California and ponder the meaning of these bizarre ""doublet"" turbidites. But ultimately, Goldfiner said, he came to realize that these San Andreas turbidites might represent two different quakes: One, from the far-off Cascadia region, which shook off only lighter silt and sand, and the second, from a soon-after San Andreas quake that was locally stronger and could move coarser material. ""That would explain it,"" Goldfinger said. ""It would explain the match-up of ages… that's what broke the dam."" The researchers argue in their new paper, published Sept. 29 in the journal Geosphere , that large quakes in Cascadia can transfer stress to the neighboring San Andreas, which then leads to a San Andreas earthquake not long after. Earthquakes triggering one another are not unheard of, said Harold Tobin , a seismologist at the University of Washington who was not involved in the research. But most of those examples occur in the same fault zone. ""There aren’t really examples that I can think of where two different types of plate boundary faults are so tightly coupled as what’s proposed in this paper,"" Tobin told Live Science. The work was carefully done, he said, but ""for me, the jury is still out on whether there could be other explanations for the sediment deposits or not."" Cascadia and the northern San Andreas region are highly seismically active, and many other faults could trigger earthquakes, Tobin said. Sedimentary deposits are complicated to interpret, and there are uncertainties inherent in radiocarbon dating. ""There are an awful lot of reasons why this is a complicated system,"" Tobin said. ""This is an intriguing set of observations, but it’s going to take even more detailed work to corroborate."" Goldfinger said he hoped the work would inspire Cascadia geologists and San Andreas geologists to work more closely together to do that detailed work. ""We all have a lot to learn from each other,"" he said. ""I’m hoping it will ratchet up the quality of science on both sides.""",https://www.livescience.com/planet-earth/earthquakes/link-between-cascadia-and-san-andreas-fault-earthquakes-discovered-30-years-after-lost-vessel-stumbled-across-key-data,Science,BBC,,https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/fiVDWLoLHzaFv9TCieASNY-1600-80.jpg,2025-10-13T15:09:46+00:00,abd2aac973447e7e61aeb0c5eb63364ae000d13a
0fc2aff3b3a8,AI reveals hidden 'ring fault' that is unleashing earthquakes at Italy's Campi Flegrei volcano,,"An artificial intelligence (AI) model has revealed never-before-seen geological structures at Italy's Campi Flegrei volcano, including a clear ""ring fault"" that could unleash magnitude 5 earthquakes. So far in 2025, Campi Flegrei has produced five earthquakes above magnitude 4, and the volcano has been showing signs of unrest since 2005. But most of the earthquakes triggered in the region are going undetected, according to a new study that used AI to pinpoint tens of thousands of seismic events that have gone under the radar over the past few years. ""We've known that this is a risky place for a long time,"" study co-author William Ellsworth , a professor emeritus of geophysics at Stanford University, said in a statement . ""Now we're seeing for the first time the geologic structures that are responsible."" Over the past 40,000 years, Campi Flegrei has produced two of the largest eruptions in Europe, and evidence suggests the volcano's earlier history was just as explosive . Scientists have been recording unrest at Campi Flegrei since the 1950s, but monitoring efforts increased in the 1980s after a swarm of 16,000 earthquakes prompted the evacuation of 40,000 residents. To investigate modern threats from Campi Flegrei, Ellsworth and his colleagues developed an AI tool capable of identifying earthquakes that previous methods couldn't pick out. Traditionally, seismologists identify earthquakes by analyzing seismograms, which are graphs with wiggly lines that represent shaking in the ground over time. Researchers look for a sudden increase in the wiggles' size, and this process is known as ""phase picking,"" said study co-author Greg Beroza , a professor of geophysics at Stanford University. ""That's a simple and often effective means of picking a phase, but it doesn't 'learn' how to do it better so that it improves with time,"" Beroza told Live Science in an email. ""In our approach, we train a machine learning model to pick phases. We base it on the collection of millions of examples where experts have done this already, and our method is designed to learn how to do this more effectively."" Get the world’s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox. The team chose to have their tool analyze Campi Flegrei before other volcanoes for several reasons, including there being an urgent need to better understand this volcano's behavior, Beroza said. More than 360,000 people live inside Campi Flegrei's 7-mile-long (11 kilometers) caldera, and roughly 1.5 million people reside in the wider area. Unrest over the past 20 years ticked up in 2018 — and while there are currently no signs of an eruption, a particularly violent or shallow earthquake could present a huge danger to people as well as damage buildings, according to the statement. The results from the AI tool, published Sept. 4 in the journal Science , reveal that three-quarters of earthquakes at Campi Flegrei between 2022 and mid-2025 went undetected. While traditional methods documented 12,000 earthquakes in this period, AI shows the number was closer to 54,000. By mapping the location of these earthquakes, the researchers discovered faults — cracks in Earth's crust that can grind against each other and cause earthquakes — that previous methods hadn't highlighted. Notably, the team found two faults converging beneath Pozzuoli, a town west of Naples where evacuations took place in the 1980s. The location of these faults suggests ""an earthquake in the magnitude 5 range is not out of the question,"" Ellsworth said. By mapping recent earthquakes in the Campi Flegrei region, researchers revealed several never-before-seen faults. This map shows two faults running almost parallel beneath the town of Pozzuoli, potentially spelling trouble. (Image credit: Xing Tan) This wasn't the only striking finding. Pozzuoli experienced uplift in the 1980s, and the same is happening again now , with the ground beneath the town rising by about 4 inches (10 centimeters) each year. It turns out, the area of uplift is encircled by several faults, forming a thin, well-marked ""ring fault"" that extends offshore, according to the statement. ""Our Italian colleagues were surprised to see the ring so clearly,"" study lead author Xing Tan , a doctoral student in Beroza's lab, said in the statement. ""They expected to see something in the south where previous data had revealed scattered seismicity, but in the north, they'd never seen it so clearly."" Seismic activity along the ring fault could help predict changes in the system, as well as hint at the magnitudes of future earthquakes, Beroza said. But it doesn't provide new information about the likelihood or timing of Campi Flegrei's next eruption. ""All the analyzed seismicity from 2022 to mid-2025 is shallow, at depths above 4 kilometers (2.5 miles) and does not indicate any migration of magma towards the surface,"" Beroza said. The team's results for Campi Flegrei indicate that the AI tool could be useful for other volcanoes, too. Places that have recently seen an uptick in seismic activity, such as Santorini in Greece , could benefit from a clearer understanding of the underlying geology, the researchers said in the statement.",https://www.livescience.com/planet-earth/volcanos/ai-reveals-hidden-ring-fault-that-is-unleashing-earthquakes-at-italys-campi-flegrei-volcano,Science,BBC,,https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/E4BvfkecbNtgANg7L2FxNK-1685-80.jpg,2025-10-13T14:45:32+00:00,05e789547d8ff86267ae643ef4cd0245c6cfc12a
45122b852a70,'Planet Y' theory hints at hidden Earth-size world lurking in the solar system — and it could be much closer to us than 'Planet Nine',,"Astronomers believe they have uncovered evidence of a previously unknown ninth planet lurking in the not-too-distant reaches of the solar system . This hypothetical world, dubbed ""Planet Y,"" could be around the same size as Earth and may exist alongside another popular Planet Nine candidate — potentially bringing our cosmic neighborhood's planetary tally to 10, if both can be confirmed. However, despite researchers' claims that this newly theorized world could be found within three years, there is no proof of its existence, and some experts are skeptical of the new findings. The search for a ninth solar system world started after the discovery of Neptune in 1846 and was temporarily concluded in the 1930s with the discovery of Pluto, which was subsequently downgraded to dwarf planet status in 2006. But the hunt restarted in 2016, when Caltech astronomers Mike Brown and Konstantin Batygin proposed their Planet Nine hypothesis , which suggested that the unusual orbits of about a dozen large objects beyond Neptune were caused by the gravitational pull of a massive hidden object. This hypothetical world, also known as Planet X, likely lurks somewhere within the Kuiper Belt — a giant disk of asteroids, comets and dwarf planets (including Pluto) that orbit the sun beyond the eight known planets — but has so far evaded detection . Now, in a study published Aug. 21 in the journal Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society , another group of researchers claims to have uncovered evidence of a completely new Planet Nine (P9) candidate, which they've dubbed Planet Y. This hypothetical world, which would also lurk within the Kuiper Belt, could be around twice as near to Earth as Planet X — and it may be much closer in size to our own planet, too. Its potential existence does not discount the Planet X theory, the researchers noted. The team came to this conclusion after analyzing the trajectories of 50 Kuiper Belt objects (KBOs) and discovering that they were tilted by around 15 degrees compared with the rest of the solar system's planets. The only thing that could explain this tilt was a hidden world, they argued. ""We started trying to come up with explanations other than a planet that could explain the tilt, but what we found is that you actually need a planet there,"" study lead author Amir Siraj , an astrophysicist at Princeton University, recently told CNN . ""This paper is not a discovery of a planet,"" he added. ""But it's certainly the discovery of a puzzle for which a planet is a likely solution."" Get the world’s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox. Researchers came up with the Planet Y theory after noticing a strange tilt in around 50 objects across the Kuiper Belt, beyond the orbit of Neptune. (Image credit: Getty Images) Based on their calculations, the study team believes that Planet Y is likely a rocky world with a mass somewhere between that of Mercury and that of Earth. This is significantly smaller than the hypothesized mass of Planet X, which is proposed as a gas giant up to 10 times more massive than Earth. The researchers also propose that Planet Y is located somewhere between 100 and 200 times farther from the sun than Earth is. That's not too far beyond the orbit of Neptune, which orbits the sun at 30 times the Earth-sun distance, and it's much closer to us than Planet X, which is likely at least 400 times farther from the sun than Earth is. (At these distances, both planets would reflect very little light back to Earth, making them hard to spot directly.) If it exists, Planet Y would also be tilted by up to 10 degrees compared with the orbital plane shared by the eight known planets — another factor that would make it harder to detect, the researchers wrote. However, not everyone agrees with the new proposal. Samantha Lawler , an astronomer at the University of Regina in Saskatchewan and a critic of the Planet X hypothesis, told CNN that the findings were ""not definitive,"" largely because of the small sample size of KBOs included in the study. Patryk Sofia Lykawka , an astronomer at Kindai University in Japan who specializes in KBOs, added that Planet Y was ""plausible"" but required more observations to be considered a likely possibility. To fully prove the existence of Planet Y or Planet X, researchers will either have to get very lucky and directly observe the elusive worlds, or find many more KBOs that fit with the patterns they have uncovered. Researchers believe the newly operational Vera C. Rubin observatory could help find Planet Y or Planet X in the next few years. (Image credit: Hernan Stockebrand) This may not take very long, thanks to the newly operational Vera C. Rubin Observatory in Chile, which has begun scanning the night sky with the world's largest digital camera. Many experts think this survey will uncover thousands more KBOs in the coming years, which could provide the data needed to firm up these theories. ""I think within the first two to three years [of the observatory's mission], it'll become definitive,"" Siraj said. ""If Planet Y is in the field of view of the telescope, it will be able to find it directly."" But equally, if the researchers do not find what they are looking for within this time frame, both theories could end up being chucked out for good. Other Planet Nine candidates Planet Y is not the only alternative P9 candidate that has emerged in recent years. Several other hypothetical worlds have been proposed, but all have been largely disproved. In May, researchers spotted a faint infrared dot that they thought might be a ninth planet . However, this finding was largely discounted because whatever object was responsible for this reading would have to be orbiting the sun in a plane perpendicular to the rest of the planets, which is extremely unlikely. There is also a possibility that multiple rogue planets — worlds that have been expelled from alien star systems and then captured by the sun's gravity — could lurk even farther from our home star. In 2023, calculations from Siraj revealed that there could be room for up to five Earth-like, rocky planets to hide in the very outer reaches of the solar system. Some astronomers have also proposed alternative explanations for Planet X, including that the gravitational anomalies are caused by a baby black hole or are the result of some alternative form of gravity we do not yet understand. Others have suggested that this missing world could be smaller than we think and may instead be surrounded by dozens of moons . On the other hand, some experts think the recent discovery of several dwarf planet candidates in the Kuiper Belt — including 2017 OF201 and 2023 KQ14 , which were announced in May and July, respectively — make it less likely that Planet X exists because these objects do not behave as this theory predicts. At this moment, all we can be certain of is that we still have much to learn about the vast backyard of our cosmic neighborhood.",https://www.livescience.com/space/planets/planet-y-theory-hints-at-hidden-earth-size-world-lurking-in-the-solar-system-and-it-could-be-much-closer-to-us-than-planet-nine,Science,BBC,,https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/JpgxRtvMNUm6hVH8Wom2NS-1600-80.jpg,2025-10-13T13:21:59+00:00,9aa0bb73b2f0504c45af2095cf8dd85a7489d123
3f6c178eb73c,What is type 5 diabetes? Newly recognized form of the disease gets name,,"Scientists have formally recognized a new type of diabetes, dubbed type 5 diabetes, that is thought to affect 20 to 25 million people worldwide . The condition, which is most common in Asia and Africa, was first identified more than 70 years ago but remained largely overlooked until now. Conventionally, medical textbooks describe three main types of diabetes : In type 1 , the immune system mistakenly attacks insulin-producing cells in the pancreas, leading to dangerously high blood sugar and a risk of ketoacidosis — a potentially life-threatening condition in which the body breaks down fat for energy. Type 2 , the most common form, develops when the body doesn't respond properly to insulin or doesn't make enough of it. Gestational diabetes occurs temporarily during pregnancy, marked by insulin resistance that's thought to be driven by hormonal changes. Additionally, there are other rare forms of diabetes that can result from specific genetic mutations or diseases. But now, scientists say there's another type of diabetes with a very different cause from the other kinds. It was formally classified as ""type 5 diabetes"" during an international meeting of experts in India earlier this year. (They chose the label ""type 5"" because other researchers have already proposed ""type 3"" and ""type 4"" for other forms of diabetes.) ""Type 5 diabetes is characterized by insufficient insulin secretion leading to elevated blood glucose levels, similar to other forms of diabetes,"" Dr. Rachel Reinert , an endocrinologist and assistant professor at the University of Michigan, told Live Science in an email. ""However, type 5 diabetes is not associated with autoimmunity (as in type 1 diabetes) nor insulin resistance (as is common in type 2 diabetes)."" It also lacks the features of the more rare type 3 and type 4 diabetes, she said. ""Individuals with type 5 diabetes typically have low body weight and a history of undernutrition starting in early life,"" Reinert said. Doctors think that chronic undernutrition damages the pancreas early in life, leaving its insulin-producing cells permanently weakened. So the pancreas cannot make enough insulin, but if a patient is given insulin as treatment, their cells are able to respond to it. Get the world’s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox. Treatment for type 5 diabetes needs to be managed carefully as too much insulin, coupled with too little food — a common reality in low-income countries — could result in dangerously low blood sugar. ""It is important for all patients with diabetes to know which specific type of diabetes they have, so they can get the right treatment,"" Reinert said. The YODA study Earlier this year, the Young-Onset Diabetes in sub-Saharan Africa (YODA) study, published in The Lancet Diabetes & Endocrinology , renewed interest in the condition. The team initially set out to investigate type 1 diabetes among nearly 900 young adults across Cameroon, Uganda and South Africa. But when the researchers analyzed blood samples, they found that roughly two-thirds of participants lacked the autoimmune markers seen in type 1 diabetes. Further testing revealed that these individuals still produced small but measurable amounts of insulin, unlike classic type 1 cases. But their insulin levels were below the range typically seen in type 2 diabetes. These findings pointed to a distinct, non-autoimmune, insulin-deficient type of diabetes. This was not the first time in history that the condition had been observed. In the early 1950s, British physician Philip Hugh-Jones encountered a group of 13 patients at his diabetes clinic near Kingston, Jamaica, whose symptoms did not fit type 1 or type 2 diabetes. Hugh-Jones called their condition ""type J,"" for Jamaica, but the label was forgotten and the condition was overlooked for decades. What's in a name? Correctly naming a disease not only helps guide clinicians to the best treatment options, it can also help researchers to track its prevalence and identify which factors affect patients' outcomes, Reinert said. Although type 5 diabetes has likely existed for decades, a lack of research has kept it poorly understood. Recognition is key to ensuring the condition is no longer overlooked, said Chittaranjan Yajnik , director of the Diabetes Unit at KEM Hospital in Pune, India, and co-author of an international consensus statement on type 5 diabetes published in The Lancet Global Health . ""It needs further research and funding to study its aetiology [causes], mechanism and treatment,"" he told Live Science in an email. ""Name is important to attract attention from stakeholders and funding opportunities. Otherwise it will get buried in the background noise of common varieties of diabetes.""

5bb10a857ec4,'An increasing attack on water resources from multiple fronts': Scientists warn 'day zero droughts' could hit before 2030,,"Almost three-quarters of drought-prone regions around the world will be at risk of extreme water shortages known as ""day zero droughts"" by 2100 if emissions aren't reduced, and a third of these regions could be hit before 2030, according to a new study. Areas under threat include cities in the U.S., the Mediterranean and southern Africa. ""At some point, the water might run out,"" Christian Franzke , a climate scientist and project leader at the Institute for Basic Science Center for Climate Physics at Pusan National University in South Korea, told Live Science. ""You're at home, you turn on your water tap in the kitchen or bathroom, and no water would come out."" The day-zero-drought idea — when local water demand from people, industry and agriculture exceeds the regional water supply provided by rain and reservoirs — became more prominent after 2018. A long-term drought pushed water levels in dams around Cape Town, South Africa, close to a critically low level that — had it been reached — would have caused most water supplies to be switched off , leaving about 4 million people without water. Fortunately, strict water-use restrictions were effective, and a couple of months later, heavy rain allowed the dam levels to recover. This wasn't an isolated incident. On June 19, 2019, Chennai, India — which was home to some 11 million people at the time — declared that day zero had been reached because all four of the big city reservoirs had run dry. People had to line up for hours to wait for a small allocation of water brought in by trucks from other areas. It is well known that climate change will make many regions drier through reduced rainfall, river flow and reservoir levels. But to work out when and where the most severe water shortages will hit, Franzke and his colleagues turned to climate models that factor in human water consumption as well as rainfall and river flow. The team used the Community Earth System Model (CESM), from the U.S. National Center for Atmospheric Research, and the French Centre National de Recherches Météorologiques (CNRM) model and looked at what would happen under two scenarios — one of intermediate greenhouse gas emissions, which is roughly the course the world is on at present and is projected to result in about 4.8 degrees Fahrenheit (2.7 degrees Celsius) of warming above pre-industrial levels by 2100. The other scenario was for higher emissions caused by national rivalry and reduced global cooperation is projected to lead to about 6.4 F (3.6 C) of warming. A 2018 drought in Cape Town, South Africa, led to strict water-use restrictions after water levels around the city reached critically low levels. (Image credit: Morgana Wingard/Getty Images) Both CNRM scenarios project that at least half of drought-affected regions will face unprecedented water scarcity by 2100, with 22% experiencing emergence before 2030. Get the world’s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox. Under the higher-emission scenario, the CNRM model projects that the frequency of day zero droughts will grow sharply over the coming decades, with hotspots across the Mediterranean, southern Africa, and parts of North America and Asia. It suggests that by 2100, 74% of drought-prone regions globally will be at risk of severe and persistent droughts under a high-emissions scenario. More than one-third of these regions, including some in the U.S., may face severe water scarcity between 2020 and 2030, according to the study, which was published Sept. 23 in the journal Nature Communications . The CESM model projected that smaller areas will be affected and that it will take longer for day zero drought to emerge. ""It surprised us how soon this might actually occur in so many places,"" Franzke said, adding that the study shows that global warming causes — and will accelerate — day zero drought conditions. ""We have hotspot regions about the Mediterranean, so Nice in France would be under threat, in southern Africa, Cape Town again would probably be in a hotspot,"" Franzke added. According to the CNRM model, the U.S. cities at risk by 2030 include Chicago; Washington, D.C.; Phoenix; San Diego; and Milwaukee, Franzke said. By 2060, Minneapolis; Las Vegas; Baltimore; Kansas City, Missouri; and Jacksonville, Florida, are projected to join the group. By the end of the century, the researchers said, day-zero-drought conditions could threaten some 750 million people globally, including 470 million people in cities and 290 million people in rural areas. Washington D.C. is one of the U.S. cities identified as being at risk from day zero drought by by 2030. (Image credit: halbergman/Getty Images) ""The findings are consistent with the physics that is driving a warmer, thirstier atmosphere to more rapidly drain fresh water from the continents and confirms known hotspots for increasing drought severity that also depend on changing wind patterns,"" Richard Allan , a climate scientist at the University of Reading in the U.K. who wasn't involved in the work, told Live Science. ""It paints a picture of an increasing attack on water resources from multiple fronts that is already emerging and particularly impacting urban populations."" Franzke and his colleagues also warned that the gap between day-zero-drought events in the future may shorten — particularly in the Mediterranean, Asia, southern Africa and Australia — thus making it harder for the areas to recover. This might make it impossible for people to live in badly hit areas for extended periods, Franzke said. Whether the biggest factor driving an increase in day zero droughts is climate change or water use will vary by region. ""It's very location dependent,"" he said. But knowing which areas are most at risk could aid the development of local and integrated water management strategies, said Franzke, as will working at a grander scale on policies to speed up the transition away from fossil fuels and toward clean energy to arrest climate change. ""It is only by adapting to intensifying prolonged dry periods but also rapidly cutting greenhouse gases that the increasing impacts from more severe dry extremes in a warming world can be limited,"" Allan said.",https://www.livescience.com/planet-earth/climate-change/an-increasing-attack-on-water-resources-from-multiple-fronts-scientists-warn-day-zero-droughts-could-hit-before-2030,Science,BBC,,https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/tAosTVNxi45bDGgzbFbxHW-1600-80.jpg,2025-10-13T12:42:27+00:00,1028be99e28bd69304eb7fa446ac2c1a64e23806
c2f146a28391,Hidden 'doomed' star revealed by James Webb Space Telescope could solve decades-old mystery,,"The James Webb Space Telescope ( JWST ) has revealed a hidden ""doomed"" star that could help solve a giant astrophysical mystery. The star is a massive red supergiant, which JWST snapped just before the star exploded in a fiery supernova. Massive red supergiants should, in theory, cause most supernovas, but they're rarely observed. The latest JWST observation, described in a new study published Wednesday (Oct. 8) in The Astrophysical Journal Letters , adds weight to the idea that these giants are often obscured by clouds of dust. ""For multiple decades, we have been trying to determine exactly what the explosions of red supergiant stars look like,"" study lead author Charlie Kilpatrick , a research assistant professor studying massive stars at Northwestern University in Illinois, said in a statement . ""Only now, with JWST, do we finally have the quality of data and infrared observations that allow us to say precisely the exact type of red supergiant that exploded and what its immediate environment looked like."" Stars around the size of our sun swell up near the end of their lifecycles to become red giants before going supernova . Red supergiants are massive stars on the verge of detonating, typically measuring hundreds or thousands of times larger than our sun. The All-Sky Automated Survey for Supernovae first detected the supernova from the newly imaged supergiant in June. The supernova, officially named SN 2025pht, came from a galaxy called NGC 1637 , which is located 38 million light-years from Earth — pretty close for something in space. The authors of the new study identified the supergiant's source star (its progenitor) by comparing historical Hubble Space Telescope data to new JWST images of NGC 1637 taken before and after the explosion. Researchers combined observations from JWST and Hubble to make this image of spiral galaxy NGC 1637, with additional images of the massive red supergiant before and after it went supernova. (Image credit: NASA, ESA, CSA, STScI, Charles Kilpatrick (Northwestern), Aswin Suresh (Northwestern)) Researchers like Kilpatrick have suggested that the most massive aging stars might also be the dustiest, so their light is blocked. This possible explanation tracks with the new JWST observation. The star shone about 100,000 times brighter than our sun, but the team estimated that its dust was so thick that this light was made more than 100 times dimmer, according to the statement. The dust was also particularly effective at blocking shorter, blue wavelengths of light . Fortunately, JWST's powerful infrared detection could see the longer red wavelengths, providing an unprecedented detailed look at a supergiant on the brink of going supernova. Get the world’s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox. ""SN2025pht is surprising because it appeared much redder than almost any other red supergiant we've seen explode as a supernova,"" Kilpatrick said. ""That tells us that previous explosions might have been much more luminous than we thought because we didn't have the same quality of infrared data that JWST can now provide.""",https://www.livescience.com/space/astronomy/hidden-doomed-star-revealed-by-james-webb-space-telescope-could-solve-decades-old-mystery,Science,BBC,,https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/FrAC2L6YT8A5fiuRMxhekg-2560-80.jpg,2025-10-13T12:00:00+00:00,848d72d325880d4881b38473851c72974d43fd07
46b66457ddb7,An 'ice tsunami' in 2024 ripped through the Yukon with such force it tore up trees and the riverbed,,"A landslide into a river in Canada's Yukon territory last December sent a tsunami of ice slabs flying over two football fields away, severing trees in the process. Now, new research suggests that the damage from this ""ice tsunami"" was worsened by the destructive force of the river ice. However, it was also restricted to a smaller area than if the landslide had hit in summer and created an ice-free wave. ""This effect is an important consideration for future landslide and tsunami hazard assessments in cold regions,"" study author Derek Cronmiller , a permafrost geologist with the Yukon Geological Survey, wrote in a new paper. Cronmiller visited the remote disaster site 24 days after the landslide and published his findings Sept. 25 in the journal Landslides . The ice tsunami hit on Dec. 17, 2024, when a steep slope above the Takhini River failed without warning. About 4.1 million cubic feet (118,000 cubic meters) of dirt and rock tumbled into the river, which was covered in ice at the time. The impact created an ice-studded tsunami that washed over 17.8 acres (7.2 hectares) of the river and its banks. River ice cracked up to 820 feet (250 m) away, and chunks of ice over 43 square feet (4 square m) were found 656 feet (200 m) from the landslide. The icy wave scoured vegetation from the river's banks, stripping all but the four largest trees from the bank opposite the landslide. On that slope, only trees with trunks of diameters over 11.8 inches (30 centimeters) survived. The ice tsunami demolished all but the four largest trees from the bank opposite the landslide. (Image credit: Derek Cronmiller) Some slabs of river ice were flipped over, with about 4 inches to a foot (10 to 30 cm) of sand stuck to them. These slabs had been frozen solid to the bottom of the river, Cronmiller wrote, and the force of the tsunami ripped the riverbed up with them. Landslides are typically triggered by snowmelt, rainfall or human activity, but Cronmiller found no evidence of an external trigger for the Dec. 17 event. Instead, the slope underwent a ""brittle failure,"" meaning it cracked without any signs of warping or deformation. Get the world’s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox. Fortunately, no one was hurt in the incident, which happened 15.5 miles (25 km) northwest of Whitehorse, Yukon, in a rural area. The river is a destination for outdoor activities, however. Dogsledders and snowmobilers use it as a thoroughfare in winter, while river rafters traverse the Takhini in the summer. The landslide narrowed the river by 50% and clogged it with debris, which could be hazardous to paddlers for years to come, Cronmiller wrote. The new study found that it will likely take the Takhini River more than a decade to carve its way back through the landslide debris.",https://www.livescience.com/planet-earth/rivers-oceans/an-ice-tsunami-in-2024-ripped-through-the-yukon-with-such-force-it-tore-up-trees-and-the-riverbed,Science,BBC,,https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/CkE2MW7dsUgtfQxaunWUxG-1600-80.jpg,2025-10-13T11:24:28+00:00,1cacc67e7f66dfd19fe14d2f74a86c456ab68d35
ec55e0e408f9,"$100,000 quadrillion asteroid Psyche may be the product of metal volcanoes, study hints",,"The asteroid Psyche may have once had vents that spewed molten metal — but only if it is chemically similar to rare, metal-rich meteorites, a new study suggests. The study, which was published online July 31 in the Journal of Geophysical Research: Planets , could explain why the space rock has an unusual metallic cloak. Potato-shaped asteroid Psyche, a member of the main asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter, is unique in being super-shiny. Radar measurements indicate that, on average, its surface reflects nearly a third of the sunlight shining on it, making it at least twice as reflective as most asteroids. Because of its reflectivity, scientists have posited that Psyche isn’t just mostly metal but may actually be the exposed iron-rich heart of a planetary building block. Samuel Courville , a planetary scientist at Arizona State University, described Psyche to Live Science in an email as ""a relic from the dawn of the solar system ."" Some have estimated the value of its metals to be a staggering $100,000 quadrillion . However, this shininess may be mostly skin-deep. In 2020, calculations involving updated estimates of Psyche’s mass and volume suggested that the asteroid’s density wasbetween 231 lbs per cubic foot (3,700 kilograms per cubic meter) and 256 lbs/cubic foot (4,100 kg/cubic meter). While denser than most asteroids, it’s only about half the density expected if Psyche were made entirely of iron and nickel. This, along with surface heat emission data, indicated that while Psyche's bulk is largely non-metallic, the asteroid probably possesses a metal-rich cloak. Scientists still aren’t sure how Psyche acquired this coat. Although many phenomena could be responsible, the most favored at present is ferrovolcanism . ""Ferrovolcanism is like normal volcanism except instead of molten rock, the 'lava' is molten metal,"" Courville, who wasn’t involved in the new study, said. A cutaway view of the internal structure of one of the study's models. Channels (yellow lines) transport molten metal from the core (yellow) through the porous mantle (in orange) to the surface.

The difference in density between the core's solid exterior and molten interior would have created enough pressure for the latter to pierce into the overlying mantle and the asteroid’s surface, creating vents that spewed molten metal. But ferrovolcanism can only work with specific chemical compositions, since it greatly depends on how much pressure builds up in the inner core. Data from meteorites — space rocks that fall on Earth’s surface — help constrain the range of these chemical combinations. Get the world’s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox. To determine the chemistry that could have spawned Psyche’s iron-spewing vents, the authors of the new study — Jaap Jorritsma , a Ph.D. student at Delft University of Technology and Win van Westrenen, a professor of earth sciences at Vrije University in Amsterdam — created computer models of the asteroid. They considered the asteroid to have a chemical makeup similar to one of three types of meteorites : EH-chondrites (rare, stony meteorites lacking iron), H-chondrites (commonplace, stony meteorites with moderate amounts of iron) and mesosiderites (rare, iron-rich meteorites). The researchers then ran simulations to figure out which chemical composition was most favorable for ferrovolcanism to occur. The researchers found that Psyche’s bulk must be rich in metals like iron, as low iron content would lead to tiny cores in which the internal pressure generated is insufficient to push out magma. This meant that Psyche was most likely to have had ferrovolcanism if it contained large amounts of mesosiderite. H-chondrites could lead to the spewing of molten metal too, but only if they had a relatively high density. In contrast, EH-chondrites only produced tiny cores that lacked iron-rich exteriors, making them unlikely to constitute part of Psyche. The researchers expect NASA’s ongoing Psyche mission will provide evidence supporting their findings. Scheduled to arrive at Psyche by July 2029, the spacecraft will spend two years photographing the asteroid and collecting spectroscopic data. Courville said that these snapshots will reveal if surface metal is in large outcrops or flows, which would indicate that ferrovolcanism had occurred in the space rock's past.",https://www.livescience.com/space/asteroids/usd100-000-quadrillion-asteroid-psyche-may-be-the-product-of-metal-volcanoes-study-hints,Science,BBC,,https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/J7AodqhZVM5EioRZpHWrHV-1600-80.jpg,2025-10-13T11:00:00+00:00,311d56c10ccc428c0feb169995550b92f22cbd50

The skeleton originally had jointed arms and legs, but only a portion of its left leg remains today. Its skull features large, round eye sockets and a toothy grin. The bronze figurine measures roughly 2.6 inches (6.6 centimeters) tall and is in the collection of the Getty Villa in Los Angeles, California. According to a 1980 study by then-Getty curator Faya Causey Frel, the skeleton was a kind of ""memento mori"" — a symbol of the brevity of life and the inevitability of death. The spooky skeletons were probably handed out at dinner parties in a nod to Epicureanism, the philosophical system that considered that because death is humans' main fear, we should take pleasure in what life has to offer. Banqueting and death were often linked in Roman art and literature, according to the Getty.

He threw it down upon the table a time or two, and its mobile articulation caused it to assume grotesque attitudes."" Trimalchio, the host, then exclaims that ""this skeleton before us here is as important as we ever were! Let's live then while we may and life is dear.""

104e60cde498,Scientists 'reawaken' ancient microbes from permafrost — and discover they start churning out CO2 soon after,,"Microbes that have been suspended in permafrost for up to 40,000 years could ""reawaken"" and start churning out greenhouse gases if Arctic summers grow much longer, new research suggests. Under future climate conditions, microbes that have been dormant since the last ice age (2.6 million to 11,700 years ago) may only need a few months to reactivate, according to a study published Sept. 23 in the Journal of Geophysical Research: Geosciences . If they do so for even a part of the year, scientists warn this could trigger a feedback loop that would accelerate permafrost thaw and global warming . Permafrost is a mix of soil, rocks and ice that has been frozen solid for at least two years straight. A hot spell may thaw the topmost layer of permafrost, known as the active layer, but ancient microbes lurk much deeper down, in layers that thaw only if temperatures rise significantly and for extended periods. For the new study, researchers traveled to Alaska, where permafrost underlies 85% of the land . ""You might have a single hot day in the Alaskan summer, but what matters much more is the lengthening of the summer season to where these warm temperatures extend into the autumn and spring,"" study lead author Tristan Caro , a postdoctoral research associate in geobiology at Caltech, said in a statement . Caro and his colleagues collected samples from the Permafrost Research Tunnel near Fairbanks. The tunnel sits 50 feet (15 meters) below ground and extends more than 350 feet (107 m) into the permafrost, offering a glimpse into life during the late Pleistocene epoch (129,000 to 11,700 years ago). Their aim was to determine resuscitation and growth rates in microbes that lived during this time. But as Caro entered the tunnel, he also noticed mammoth and bison bones protruding from the icy walls, according to the statement. ""The first thing you notice when you walk in there is that it smells really bad,"" said Caro, who conducted the research as a graduate student at the University of Colorado Boulder. ""To a microbiologist, that's very exciting because interesting smells are often microbial."" Get the world’s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox. Back in the lab, the researchers drenched the samples in water containing unusually heavy hydrogen atoms, also known as deuterium. They then incubated the samples in refrigerators set to 25, 39 or 54 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 4, 4 and 12 degrees Celsius) and regularly examined them for changes in microbial activity. ""We wanted to simulate what happens in an Alaskan summer, under future climate conditions where these temperatures reach deeper areas of the permafrost,"" Caro said. One month into the experiment, the team didn't note much change, even in the two warmer samples. A handful of microbes had awakened from their long slumber, but only 0.001% to 0.01% of cells were replaced daily by new, active ones.

The deuterium in the samples enabled the researchers to track how much water microbes consumed to build the fatty membranes around their cells. This revealed that the ancient organisms preferentially produced fatty acids called glycolipids, which researchers think may be involved in cryopreservation. Six months into the experiment, the microbes incubated at 39 F and 54 F had undergone ""dramatic"" changes in community structure and activity levels, according to the study. The samples were less diverse than active layers of permafrost, but the microbes were as active as their more modern counterparts, even producing slimy structures called biofilms that were visible to the naked eye. ""These are not dead samples by any means,"" Caro said. About 85% of Alaska's land is underlain by permafrost, which is thawing at alarming rates. (Image credit: Brandt Meixell/USGS) The results have implications for the Arctic and Earth's climate more broadly, because microbes in the permafrost survive on organic matter, which they convert into carbon dioxide and methane. Global temperatures are rising faster in the Arctic than anywhere else in the world, thawing the permafrost at alarming rates and for increasing lengths of time. As Arctic summers grow longer and temperatures rise in the deeper layers, colonies of ancient microbes could awaken and start emitting carbon. Permafrost in northern regions currently holds about twice as much carbon as Earth's atmosphere, so large-scale releases could contribute significantly to climate change. This would accelerate permafrost thaw, triggering a vicious cycle of warming, more thaw and more warming. ""It's one of the biggest unknowns in climate responses,"" study co-author Sebastian Kopf , an associate professor of geological sciences at the University of Colorado Boulder, said in the statement. ""How will the thawing of all this frozen ground, where we know there's tons of carbon stored, affect the ecology of these regions and the rate of climate change?"" But the study only examined ancient microbes from one location, and microbes in other regions may react differently to warming, the researchers noted. ""There's so much permafrost in the world — in Alaska, Siberia and in other northern cold regions,"" Caro said. ""We've only sampled one tiny slice of that.""",https://www.livescience.com/planet-earth/arctic/scientists-reawaken-ancient-microbes-from-permafrost-and-discover-they-start-churning-out-co2-soon-after,Science,BBC,,https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/P5sPEab56hipEYSUFmHV4N-1500-80.jpg,2025-10-13T09:43:13+00:00,e190fd1dc28c735128556a45d4ec034cd7dac1c7
825ee7e84881,What if Christopher Columbus had never reached the Americas?,,"Christopher Columbus sailed westward in 1492, hoping to find a new route to China and South Asia, but he hit a major roadblock — the Americas — and landed in the Caribbean. Columbus wasn't the first European to reach the Western Hemisphere; the Vikings had landed in Newfoundland about 500 years earlier . But the Vikings didn't colonize North America , and Columbus' expedition led to the large-scale colonization of the Western Hemisphere by Europeans. So, how would history have played out if Columbus' voyage had failed — perhaps if his vessels had sunk or the crews were forced to turn around before reaching the Western Hemisphere? Some experts told us that, in a sense, Columbus' voyage did fail. He ""did not fulfill his goal to prove a new westward route to Asia's riches,"" Douglas Hunter , an independent scholar who holds a doctorate in history and has written extensively about Columbus and other explorers, told Live Science in an email. Columbus himself did not admit this . Instead, he continued to claim that the lands he had ""discovered"" were part of Asia, even as evidence mounted to the contrary. Who would have ""discovered"" the New World? Indigenous peoples reached the Americas at least 23,000 years ago , but Europeans didn't arrive until much later. Scholars agreed that if Columbus had failed to reach the Western Hemisphere, someone else from Europe would have reached it soon enough. The ""1480s had demonstrated that Atlantic exploration was profitable, thanks to such products as sugar, cod, seals, whales, walrus and narwhal ivory, West African gold, and Icelandic and African slaves,"" Felipe Fernández-Armesto , a history professor at the University of Notre Dame, told Live Science in an email. ""So landfall on the far shore would [have happened] some time."" Who would have reached the Western Hemisphere and what would have happened is a source of debate. Geoffrey Symcox , a professor emeritus of history at UCLA, said that Spain would have likely lost to its Iberian neighbor. ""If Spain didn't try again, the voyage would have been sponsored by Portugal,"" Symcox told Live Science in an email. He noted that Portugal had been sailing down the coast of Africa since the early 15th century and that the Portuguese had ventured far enough into the Atlantic to colonize the Azores and Madeira. A map showing the Azores (purple) and Madeira (blue), which are part of Portugal, and the Canary Islands (red), which are part of Spain. The Canary Islands have more favorable conditions for sailing to the Western Hemisphere than the other islands do. (Image credit: Map Data Copyright 2025 Google, INEGI) It's likely that ""if Columbus had failed, the next Atlantic voyage would have been promoted, quickly, by the Portuguese Crown,"" Symcox said. ""The king of Portugal was well aware of Spanish intentions and would have moved fast to pre-empt any further Spanish moves."" Fernández-Armesto isn't so sure that Portugal would have beaten Spain, noting that the Canary Islands, which Spain controlled and which Columbus sailed from, was the best place for launching a westward expedition. It ""would probably happen to a Spanish expedition, as the Canary Islands were, from the point of view of the wind system, the best place to start from,"" Fernández-Armesto said. How would history have unfolded? If a Portuguese explorer had reached the Western Hemisphere first, a number of events would be different. Hunter noted that the Treaty of Tordesillas, in 1494, which divided the Atlantic realm between Spain and Portugal, would not have occurred, as Portugal may not have felt compelled to split the region with Spain. The 16th-century conquests of Hernán Cortés against the Aztec Empire and Francisco Pizarro against the Inca would not have happened as both of them were Spaniards backed by Spain, although someone from Portugal probably would have carried them out, Hunter said.

Neyman - NV Media/Alamy) If Spain had still reached the Western Hemisphere first, as Fernández-Armesto thinks is likely, then history may not be that different. The ""historical difference would have been slight and the delay probably not significant,"" he said. Linguistically some things could be different. If a Portuguese explorer had reached the Americas first, it's possible Portuguese would be more widely spoken in the Western Hemisphere than it is today. Also, if Columbus had failed to reach the Western Hemisphere, it's no surprise that his name would not be widespread across the Americas. The District of Columbia in the U.S. and the country of Colombia are just two of many places that bear his name. It's possible that North and South America would still have places named for a European explorer. Hunter noted that the Pinzón brothers commanded the Niña and Pinta in Columbus' fleet. If Columbus had failed but the two brothers had later sailed successfully to the Western Hemisphere, it's possible some places could be named after them. Both brothers were highly capable sailors who Columbus considered qualified to captain two of the fleet's vessels. ""The capital district of the United States could be Pinzonia,"" Hunter said. None of the sources Live Science contacted mentioned a scenario in which the Indigenous peoples of the Western Hemisphere would not be adversely affected by European contact through the devastation brought by the diseases they introduced and conquests they carried out. However, it's important to note that the Indigenous peoples of the Western Hemisphere fought back, and today, native groups continue on, practicing their languages and cultures.",https://www.livescience.com/archaeology/what-if-christopher-columbus-had-never-reached-the-americas,Science,BBC,,https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5Jk3RHodjCQvsAKCid2i55-1600-80.png,2025-10-13T09:00:00+00:00,2c63cf1a5c0cfd73654ccb78dab08aacdaa53dfb
dbc796fa4153,Physicists capture rare illusion of an object moving at 99.9% the speed of light,,"Using ultra-fast laser pulses and special cameras, scientists have simulated an optical illusion that appears to defy Einstein's theory of special relativity . One consequence of special relativity is that fast-moving objects should appear shortened in the direction of motion — a phenomenon known as Lorentz contraction. This effect has been confirmed indirectly in particle accelerator experiments. But in 1959, mathematician Roger Penrose and physicist James Terrell pointed out that an observer with a camera wouldn't actually see a squashed object at all. Instead, because light from different parts of the object takes different times to reach the camera, it would appear rotated. Although previous models have worked with this illusion, now called the Terrell-Penrose effect, this is the first time it has been done in a lab setting. The team described their results in the journal Communications Physics . ""What I like most is the simplicity,"" Dominik Hornof , a quantum physicist at the Vienna University of Technology and first author of the study, told Live Science. ""With the right idea, you can recreate relativistic effects in a small lab. It shows that even century-old predictions can be brought to life in a really intuitive way."" Re-creating the illusion In the new study, physicists used ultra-fast laser pulses and gated cameras to produce snapshots of a cube and a sphere ""moving"" at nearly the speed of light. The results showed snapshots of rotated objects. This proved the Terrell-Penrose effect to be true. The researchers fired ultra-short laser pulses at their test object and then used a delay generator to tell the camera exactly when to open its shutter (for just billionths of a second). This camera captured single slices of light bouncing off the object. They repeated the process and shifted the object between shots. The team built up the illusion of an object racing at near light speed. (Image credit: Hornof et al., 2025 ; CC BY 4.0 ) But like every study, this one also had its difficulties. Moving any object at or near the speed of light is currently impossible. ""As you get closer to the speed of light, the energy you need grows by a lot,"" Hornof said. We cannot generate enough energy to accelerate something like a cube, and ""that's why we need huge particle accelerators, even just to move electrons close to that speed. It would take a huge amount of energy."" So the team used a clever substitute. ""What we can do is mimic the visual effect,"" Hornof said. They started with a cube of about 3 feet (1 meter) on each side. Then, they fired ultra-short laser pulses — each just 300 picoseconds long, or about a tenth of a billionth of a second — at the object. They captured the reflected light with a gated camera that opened only for that instant and produced a thin ""slice"" each time. After each slice, they moved the cube forward about 1.9 inches (4.8 cm). That is the distance it would have traveled if it were moving at 80% the speed of light during the delay between pulses. Then, the scientists put all of these slices together into a snapshot of the cube in motion. ""When you combine all the slices, the object looks like it's racing incredibly fast, even though it never moved at all,"" Hornof said. ""At the end of the day, it's just geometry."" They repeated the process with a sphere, shifting it by 2.4 inches (6 cm) per step to mimic 99.9% light speed. When the slices were combined, the cube appeared rotated and the sphere looked as if you could peek around its sides. ""The rotation is not physical,"" Hornof said. ""It's an optical illusion. The geometry of how light arrives at the same time tricks our eyes."" That is why the Terrell-Penrose effect does not contradict Einstein's special relativity. A fast-moving object is physically shortened along its direction of travel, but a camera doesn't capture that directly. Because light from the back takes longer to arrive than light from the front, the snapshot shifts in a way that makes the object appear rotated. ""When we did the calculations, we were surprised how beautifully the geometry worked out,"" Hornof said. ""Seeing it appear in the images was really exciting.""

a4018a9fbd72,Hubble went supernova hunting — and found something unexpected: Space photo of the week,,"QUICK FACTS What it is: NGC 6000, a spiral galaxy Where it is: 102 million light-years away in the constellation Scorpius When it was shared: Sept. 29, 2025 Here’s a story for the ages — or maybe a story of the ages. The Hubble Space Telescope ’s latest image, of barred spiral galaxy NGC 6000, is rich in yellow at its center and blue on its outskirts, but it’s what these colors reveal about the ages, masses and temperatures of the galaxy’s stars that makes the portrait truly fascinating. The yellow tells the story of the center of NGC 6000, where stars are old, small and relatively cool. These stars have been shining for billions of years. In astronomy, cool stars are red, while the hottest stars are blue. The latter dominate the outskirts of this galaxy, where its spiral arms are filled with stars that are younger, hotter and larger. These stars are cosmic newborns. The image, which is also available as a panning video , was produced while Hubble searched for supernova explosions — hence the incomplete framing. The aging space telescope targeted the faint glow of supernovas called SN 2007ch and SN 2010as, stars that exploded in 2007 and 2010, respectively. However, while imaging NGC 6000, Hubble also captured something else entirely. Look on the right-hand side of the image, and four faint broken lines can be seen — the path of an asteroid that drifted across Hubble’s field of view as it took four long-exposure images of NGC 6000. The broken lines are red and blue because Hubble used red and blue filters to collect visible light, which makes it easier for astronomers to compare stars by their colors. Although it’s in the constellation Scorpius, which is visible in summer from the Northern Hemisphere, NGC 6000 lies south of the celestial equator, according to The Sky Live . That means it’s more easily visible from the Southern Hemisphere. However, to glimpse it requires at least a 10-inch aperture telescope and a dark sky.

d67f5d676a6a,Which planets are the youngest and oldest in our solar system?,,"About 4.6 billion years ago, a celestial cloud collapsed, paving the way for our solar system to form. Then, a nebula with strong gravitational pull took shape, kick-starting the birth of the sun. But after that, the details leave more room for debate about which planets formed first. So, what do we know about which planets emerged early, and which ones developed later on? Despite advanced techniques like dating organic materials from space, going on multiple visits to the moon, and sending rover expeditions to Mars, planetary scientists are still unsure about the ultimate birth order of the planets in the solar system . Beyond the planets' initial formation, there are also several competing theories to explain the order in which the planets came to be. ""It's complex — there are no easy answers to measuring time in outer space,"" Michael Meyer , chair of the University of Michigan's astronomy department, told Live Science. ""It is the most difficult thing to do in astronomy."" The most commonly accepted explanation for how our solar system's eight planets formed is called accretion — when small particles of gas and dust collide and stick to each other, allowing them to gain gravitational pull and grow over time. One popular theory, which assumes accretion took place, is that the large planets started to form first, far from the sun, according to NASA . As they got bigger, they moved outward, making room for the terrestrial, rocky planets to form. These formations took place closer to the sun and millions of years later (a relatively short time span in astronomical terms). ""In order to form a gas giant planet, you have to have enough gas to make a Jupiter — and that gives us a hard upper limit for how long it can take to form a gas giant,"" Meyer said. ""If you don't get the whole process started fast enough and the gas goes away, then you can't make a gas giant. That's why we think the gas giants formed first."" But a competing theory, called the streaming instability model, offers a different explanation. By allowing planets to gather mass more spontaneously, this theory could allow an entirely different sequence to take place. ""I would argue that maybe the terrestrial planets formed first and then the giant planets just stopped forming when there was no more gas,"" Cauê Borlina , an assistant professor of planetary science at Purdue University, told Live Science. ""After that, it just becomes this chaotic buildup."" Determining a planet's age Scientists are still debating which theory best explains the solar system's formation. But even the way they think about the age of a planet isn't straightforward. ""There are two different ways of thinking about the age of a planet,"" Gaia Stucky de Quay , a planetary scientist at MIT, told Live Science. Instead of dating a planet based on its provenance, some scientists focus their attention on its surface. ""The way I think about ages is more the age of the surface, because surfaces can be really old, like a preserved surface, or surfaces can be really young if stuff is still happening"" like active plate tectonics , Stucky de Quay said. One method scientists use to determine a planet's age is to manually count the craters on its surface. From this perspective, Earth could be considered the youngest planet, as its surface changes continuously, with Venus and Mars coming next, she said. Unfortunately, the limitations of current planetary dating methods mean that scientists can only estimate how old each planet is. And because even a small margin of error can amount to millions of years in the history of the universe , researchers are still working to gather data to piece together a more precise timeline. ""If we ever want to try to get this full picture of how and when planets form, I think samples are a crucial part of that,"" Borlina said. ""And some places are a little bit harder than ours to get samples from, but we have samples sitting on Mars right now just waiting for us to bring them back.""",https://www.livescience.com/space/planets/which-planets-are-the-youngest-and-oldest-in-our-solar-system,Science,BBC,,https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/TTYY5NRhFT3GT2QzzXPSYK-1600-80.jpg,2025-10-12T09:00:00+00:00,7e6da93865530e76a7bbc1939ee794b430f96724
3b53a7c37156,"Hidden, supercharged 'thermostat' may cause Earth to overcorrect for climate change",,"Earth may respond to the huge quantities of carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) that humans are pumping into the atmosphere by ""overcorrecting"" the imbalance, which could result in the next ice age arriving on time instead of being delayed by tens of thousands of years, as had previously been predicted. This is due to a newfound ""thermostat"" that buries mountains of carbon beneath the seafloor so efficiently, it could do away with human carbon emissions within 100,000 years, researchers have discovered. That's several times quicker than scientists assumed would happen with a previously described ""lazy thermostat"" that locks away carbon on timescales of 500,000 to 1 million years, the team reported in a study published Sept. 25 in the journal Science . With both thermostats working in tandem, it's possible that the next ice age could start on time, instead of being delayed by the effects of climate change , study co-author Andy Ridgwell , a professor of geology at the University of California, Riverside, told Live Science. The newfound thermostat does not protect humans living now from the effects of global warming, said study co-author Dominik Hülse , a mathematician and biogeochemical modeler at the University of Bremen in Germany. ""It's not to say that we will be safe from global warming in the next 100 or even 1,000 years,"" he told Live Science. Scientists have long suspected that Earth regulates its climate on geological timescales. Since the 1980s, researchers have theorized about a mechanism called the silicate weathering feedback, which occurs when rain captures CO 2 from the air and sprays it onto silicate rocks — rocks with minerals made of oxygen and silicon that constitute about 90% of the planet's crust. CO 2 reacts with these rocks, dissolving them and forming molecules that leach into the ground and eventually end up in the ocean. Once there, what was once CO 2 forms limestone and chalk, meaning it is locked away for millions of years. The silicate weathering feedback is like a thermostat because the more CO 2 that is in the atmosphere, the warmer Earth gets and the more the water cycle intensifies . As precipitation increases, silicate weathering accelerates, meaning more CO 2 is transferred to the ocean and atmospheric CO 2 sinks to background levels again. Get the world’s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox. The feedback also works the other way around. ""If you get too cold and CO 2 is too low, then the thermostat is consuming too little CO 2 compared with a background of constant release of CO 2 from the mantle, from volcanoes and other magma features,"" Ridgwell said. In this scenario, less CO 2 ends up in the ocean and atmospheric levels slowly increase back to average levels, he said. But the silicate weathering feedback moves slowly; it can take up to 1 million years after a perturbation to rebalance CO 2 levels. As a result, there are climate events it can't explain, including Earth's glacial and interglacial cycles, which are characterized by huge fluctuations in CO 2 levels and temperature that occur roughly every 100,000 years, Ridgwell said. Silicate weathering also can't explain snowball Earth events , which completely cover the planet in ice, Hülse said. If silicate weathering were the only thermostat regulating Earth's climate, its smooth balancing act would prevent it from tipping into such extreme conditions, Hülse explained. A second ""thermostat"" The new research was inspired by Hülse's doctoral dissertation , in which he calculated how much organic carbon was preserved in ocean sediments during past climatic events. His results showed that after periods of intense volcanic activity and warming, mountains of organic carbon were deposited onto the seafloor. This finding suggested there might be a link between atmospheric CO 2 levels and organic carbon burial in the ocean. ""There are definitely times in Earth's history when a lot of organic carbon has been deposited,"" Ridgwell said. ""We've sort of known that there must be other things going on [besides silicate weathering], but it's much more complex to put in a model."" But Hülse and Ridgwell tackled this challenge in the new study by amalgamating their individual projects into a single global climate carbon cycle model that accounted for organic carbon burial in the seafloor. Their results revealed a second ""thermostat"" rooted in Earth's phosphorus cycle, which starts on land with rocks containing minerals such as apatite, the researchers said. Weathering of these rocks due to precipitation releases phosphorus, which leaches into the ground, enters streams and rivers, and eventually ends up in the ocean. There, phosphorus is a key nutrient for tiny photosynthetic creatures known as phytoplankton, which use it to fuel cellular processes. When phytoplankton die, they sink to the ocean bottom, where they deposit organic carbon, phosphorus and other nutrients. Phytoplankton take up phosphorus to power cellular processes, and when they die, they bring it with them to the seafloor. (Image credit: Roland Birke/Getty Images) In a warmer world, more phosphorus is washed into the ocean and phytoplankton proliferate, meaning more organic carbon and phosphorus reach the seafloor. However, warmer oceans also hold less oxygen because oxygen becomes less soluble as temperatures increase. This deoxygenation releases deposited phosphorus back into the water column while burying organic carbon in sediments. ""Exactly how that happens is not mechanistically entirely known, but we know it happens,"" Ridgwell said. ""Where we've had these events in the past where we see massive amounts of organic carbon being buried after a warming event, there's very, very, very little phosphorus in that material compared with normal material. If it's not being buried, it must have been returned to the ocean."" As phosphorus gets recycled, it reenters the food chain and phytoplankton continue to proliferate as they feast on phosphorus from both the land and the ocean. This leads to a phytoplankton boom, which sucks more and more CO 2 out of the atmosphere and deposits more and more organic carbon onto the seafloor, which brings down global temperatures. So, the warmer the world gets, the more productive the oceans become and the more carbon is locked away, which cools the climate. But the difference between phosphorus and silicate weathering is that phosphorus in the ocean doesn't decline as soon as Earth cools, because it continues to be released at the seafloor. ""The organic carbon thermostat is a little bit like the silicate thermostat, except it has this supercharger,"" Ridgwell said. ""You end up with so many nutrients in the ocean — and they're being recycled very efficiently — that it's very difficult to get rid of them again."" The phosphorus cycle eventually regains its balance, but the planet can ""overcorrect"" in the meantime, triggering events like snowball Earth, the researchers said. It's unclear how this second thermostat will respond to climate change now, but the ocean is so rich in oxygen compared with in the past that a snowball Earth is unlikely, they said. Instead, it's possible that the organic carbon thermostat will make up for the delay expected for the next ice age. Climate change is disturbing Earth's natural cycles, and previous research suggests it could push back the next glacial period, which is due in about 11,000 years, by tens of thousands of years. But if the organic carbon thermostat activates, atmospheric CO 2 could return to background levels much faster, ensuring that the next ice age arrives on time. ""Whatever delay we'll end up with for the next ice age ... thinking about this mechanism might bring it back forward again,"" Ridgwell said. ""One is going to start at some point for sure; it's all about when it starts.""",https://www.livescience.com/planet-earth/climate-change/hidden-supercharged-thermostat-may-cause-earth-to-overcorrect-for-climate-change,Science,BBC,,https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/of4nwAArzCPeXessj5R7yC-2560-80.jpg,2025-10-11T15:00:00+00:00,0ea12f6ae1a2291ba3353a3b389d6899b96c2a4d

The comet, an interstellar interloper from far beyond our solar system , was first spotted in late June. Now, scientists are finally closing in on its age and where it came from . They discovered it likely originated in the far corners of our galaxy and could even be a relic from its earliest beginnings — making it potentially billions of years older than the sun. This discovery was accompanied by other observations, including the comet's unusual properties, with astronomers spotting it spewing water ""like a fire hose"" before it was anywhere close to the sun. Researchers are continuing to keep a close watch on the object, even deploying the European Space Agency 's (ESA) Mars spacecraft to capture the closest view yet of its bright coma .

The strange anomaly's signal and the jerk lasted for about two years, but it was 18 years before they were discovered inside data collected by satellites studying Earth's gravitational field.

The hoard dates to the Early Middle Ages and weighs about 13 pounds (6 kilograms), according to a translated statement from the Stockholm County Administrative Board . The worm digger, who found the hoard by his summer house, reported the finding to local government officials. Archaeologists are now examining the treasures, which had been placed in a copper cauldron that has largely degraded over time. ""This is probably one of the largest silver treasures from the early Middle Ages that has been found in Sweden,"" Sofia Andersson, an antiquarian at the County Administrative Board in Stockholm, said in the statement. ""We don't yet know exactly how many coins there are, but I think it could be upwards of twenty thousand."" A preliminary analysis showed that most of the silver coins date to the 12th century. Some bear the text ""KANUTUS,"" the Latin name for Knut, meaning they were minted during the reign of Swedish king Knut Eriksson, who ruled from 1173 to about 1195. A few of the coins are rare, including several ""bishop coins"" that were minted by powerful bishops, according to the statement. These coins depict a bishop holding a crosier, a shepherd's crook that was widely used by clergy as a symbol of their ecclesiastical work. ""It is completely unique; we have no other medieval treasures from Stockholm,"" Lin Annerbäck, director of the Medieval Museum in Stockholm, said in Swedish to the Swedish daily newspaper Dagens Nyheter . ""And then it seems to be extremely large too. So it is very exciting."" Get the world’s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.

As for why the hoard was buried, the end of the 12th century was a ""troubled time,"" because the Swedes were attempting to colonize areas of Finland, Annerbäck said. ""So we believe that many hid treasures like this to keep them in the family's possession,"" Annerbäck told Dagens Nyheter. ""The fact that the silver is mixed with pearls and other things makes it seem like it's someone's wealth that has been hidden away."" Research into the hoard is ongoing. The Stockholm County Administrative Board will now report the finding to the National Heritage Board, which will determine if the state will compensate the man who found the hoard. ""The finder acted completely correctly in contacting us at the County Administrative Board,"" Andersson said.

9e68dfc481b4,Einstein's relativity could rewrite a major rule about what types of planets are habitable,,"The planets around white dwarf stars might provide long-term homes for alien life , but they suffer from a fatal overheating problem. Who's going to rescue them? According to new research, it's none other than Albert Einstein . White dwarfs are the compact remnants of dead sun-like stars. They litter the universe, with the Milky Way alone home to hundreds of millions of them. And because they can stay warm for hundreds of billions of years, they are a very intriguing place to search for life. However, research had suggested that life would probably have a tough time on a planet around a white dwarf. The habitable zone — the region where temperatures are just right to support liquid water on a planetary surface — around white dwarfs spans somewhere from a tenth to a hundredth the distance between Earth and the sun. This is fine, if a bit uncomfortable, but the problem comes when the planet is not alone. If there's another planet in the system even somewhat nearby, its weak-but-persistent gravitational influence will pull the inner world into a highly elliptical orbit. Once there, it will stretch and squeeze from tidal heating. This happens in the icy moons of the outer solar system , which liquefies their interiors. But for a planet around a white dwarf, this same process will heat it up so much that it becomes totally uninhabitable. Previous research had found that this was very easy to do. Even a small deviation from a perfectly circular orbit would be enough to doom a planet. But that research only considered Newtonian gravity, which is the simple formulation of gravity that explains everything from the motion of projectiles on the Earth to the orbits of most of the planets around the sun. But we know that Newtonian gravity is not always accurate, especially for close-in orbits around dense stars. In our own solar system, Mercury's orbit slowly rotates, or precesses, around the sun, in a way that Newtonian gravity cannot explain. A major accomplishment of Einstein's theory of general relativity , which views gravity as the result of deformations in spacetime, was that it could explain Mercury's orbit. In a new paper published Sept. 30 to the preprint database arXiv, researchers performed a more careful analysis of planets orbiting white dwarf stars, accounting for the effects of general relativity. While previous researchers knew that general relativity was more accurate, it’s a much more difficult theory to use, and usually doesn’t produce significant differences in planetary orbit calculations. Get the world’s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox. But the researchers found that a more accurate treatment revealed a much wider window of habitability than previously thought. This is because the precession of the inner planet's orbit ""protects"" it from being pulled into more elliptical paths, which, in turn, prevents runaway tidal heating, the researchers explained. (The paper has not been peer-reviewed yet.) There are some cases where tidal heating is unavoidable, like if a companion planet is too big or too close. But for a wide variety of combinations, the inner planet remains in its orbit just fine. And if an alien civilization ever does develop on a planet like that, these aliens might discover general relativity on their own — and if they do, they can thank that physics for their very existence.",https://www.livescience.com/physics-mathematics/einsteins-relativity-could-rewrite-a-major-rule-about-what-types-of-planets-are-habitable,Science,BBC,,https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jr6zNvGmRFe742vYKmnwrc-1920-80.jpg,2025-10-11T10:00:00+00:00,db4b8819869221dca412832381eabf801011f8c4
76ccc05de1d7,China issues new pledge to cut greenhouse gas emissions — is it now a global leader in climate action?,,"In a video statement to the United Nations (UN) in September, China 's President Xi Jinping announced the country's first-ever plan defining set targets to cut its greenhouse gas emissions. The country aims to reduce its emissions by 7% to 10% by 2035, per the new plan. As the world's largest emitter, China has the potential to shape the global fight against climate change. The pledge is remarkable as it is the first time China has set out specific emission-reduction targets. Research indicates that the goals set out are achievable. Proponents argue that China will not fall short — and may even overdeliver — on its commitments. Some have expressed concerns , however, labeling China's nationally determined contribution (NDC) — a country's climate action plan — as insufficient to meet the target of limiting warming to 2.7 degrees Fahrenheit (1.5 degrees Celsius) above pre-industrial levels under the Paris Agreement . Still, many see it as a significant moment in global climate policy . ""China's new climate target is both underwhelming and transformative,"" Andreas Sieber , associate director of policy and campaigns at 350.org, an international environmental NGO, said in a statement . ""Reducing emissions by 7-10% by 2035 from peak levels falls short of what the world needs, yet it anchors the world's largest emitter on a path where clean-tech defines economic leadership."" China, the United States and India were the top emitters in 2024, according to the Emissions Database for Global Atmospheric Research . In 2024, China was responsible for about 29% of global greenhouse gas emissions. In contrast, the U.S. contributed 11.1%, while India contributed 8.2%. At the same time, China is surging ahead in renewable energy, having installed a record of 1,200 GW of wind and solar capacity by the end of 2024 — surpassing the 2030 target set by its National Energy Administration six years early. While coal still dominates China's power generation, these developments suggest the country may be poised to fulfil its new climate goals. So what do you think? Has China's new target positioned it as a true global leader in climate action — or is this promise too little, too late? Answer our poll and let us know what you think in the comments below.",https://www.livescience.com/planet-earth/climate-change/china-issues-new-pledge-to-cut-greenhouse-gas-emissions-is-it-now-a-global-leader-in-climate-action,Science,BBC,,https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/UkFghdb3PyMq32hxbQoM2Y-1600-80.jpg,2025-10-10T17:32:37+00:00,b5b57d17906445e018190a5eff80ed8570eb05dd
b5bac5d88f80,Extreme weather caused more than $100 billion in damage by June — smashing US records,,"The first half of 2025 logged the most damaging extreme weather on record in terms of cost, even after accounting for inflation, data shows. This is partly because of a handful of extraordinary events, such as the Los Angeles wildfires. But the number of natural disasters that struck this winter was also ""exceptional,"" Paul Ullrich , a professor of regional climate modeling at the University of California, Davis, told Live Science. All told, the first half of the year likely incurred $93 billion to $126 billion in damages, half-year estimates from insurance companies Munich Re , AON and Gallagher Re suggest. This total smashes the previous most costly first six months on record, of $57 billion (inflation-adjusted), set in 2023, according to National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration ( NOAA) data . This is part of a larger trend. Natural weather disasters have become more frequent and destructive over the past several decades as a result of climate change and land use changes, and that trend is likely to continue. ""As long as we continue to warm the planet, we can expect extreme weather to grow more severe and more frequent,"" Kristina Dahl , a climate scientist and vice president for science at Climate Central, told Live Science in an email. ""Combine that with our propensity to build communities in areas prone to climate-related hazards — think of the heavily built-up shoreline along the hurricane-prone coast of Florida or of small California communities tucked up against flammable forests — and we can expect the economic cost of those events to continue to rise as well."" So far, these natural disasters haven't led to a dramatic increase in deaths, due in part to advances in weather forecasting and early warning systems that help get people out of harm's way, experts say. But as climate change intensifies, that could change, as some disasters are projected to increase in parts of the U.S., such as floods and regional heat waves, will be more difficult for people to avoid. The Palisade and Eaton fires ripped through highly valuable properties in Los Angeles, contributing to the record-breaking costs. (Image credit: Bloomberg via Getty Images) Record-breaking winter One event this winter caused much of 2025's natural disaster damage — the Los Angeles wildfires. In January, wildfires burned through mostly ""high-value single-family homes"" in Pacific Palisades and Eaton Canyon, Zhiyun Li , a climate economist at UCLA, told Live Science in an email. Together, they are the most costly wildfires in U.S. history — and the costliest in world history. Get the world’s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox. Insurance companies Gallagher Re, Munich Re and AON estimated total damages between $53 billion and $65 billion, taking into account direct losses such as property damage. Other estimates, which factor in property damage, rebuilding costs and capital losses such as impacts on gross domestic product (GDP), and in some cases health care and relocation costs and other factors, range from $76 billion to $275 billion . In comparison, California's entire 2018 wildfire season — the costliest season on record — incurred $30 billion (inflation-adjusted) in damages, according to estimates from NOAA . The LA fires were extraordinarily destructive because they intensified quickly, as a result of strong Santa Ana winds , extremely dry conditions and overgrown vegetation from previous wet years, which dried rapidly. ""We could call it a one-two or a one-two-three punch, leading up to the catastrophic events in January,"" Daniel Swain , a climate scientist at UCLA, told Live Science. And unlike most previous wildfires, these blazes hit expensive, densely populated urban areas. In addition to the California wildfires, a high number of other extreme weather events have occurred across the U.S. — in particular tornadoes . Two tornado events, in March and May, each caused at least $8 billion in insured losses each, according to AON. Floods and winter weather have also caused a lot of damage this year. These have all helped make the first half of the year extremely costly. Costly year in the forecast If hurricane season is bad, 2025 could turn out to be the most expensive in history for weather disaster damage. The most damaging and deadly weather events in the U.S. have been hurricanes, NOAA data show. So far, the Atlantic hurricane season has been quiet— but the season runs through November , and forecasters have predicted an above-average season . Since 1980, tropical cyclones have caused more than $1.5 trillion of damage in the U.S. (inflation-adjusted) — more than all other types of extreme events combined — and have caused 7,211 deaths, more than any other extreme weather type, NOAA data show. One reason hurricanes can be so destructive is that they often make landfall in heavily developed areas. ""One of the most desirable places for building new homes and places to live is the ocean against the shore,"" said Stephen Strader , an associate professor of geography and the environment at Villanova University. ""It is beautiful 99.9% of the time, until the hurricane comes knocking and you end up with a lot of people in very highly exposed areas,"" he told Live Science. Government cuts mean NOAA has stopped publishing data on billion-dollar weather disasters. But overall, if the second half of this year is in line with the five-year average for July to December, the year's total damage cost could be in the ballpark of $220 billion. This would mean $110 billion January through June and $110 billion for July through December. To calculate this number, Live Science took the estimates of the first half of 2025 from Gallagher Re, AON and Munich Re — which NOAA previously said is comparable with its own estimates — and combined the average of those with NOAA's estimates of average damage costs from July through December between 2019 and 2024. Climate change impact The destruction caused by natural disasters has been rising rapidly in recent decades. In 1980, there were just three events that caused more than $1 billion in inflation-adjusted damage and the 1980s in total saw 33 such disasters, according to NOAA data. By comparison, 2024 alone saw 27 inflation-adjusted billion-dollar events, and the 2020s so far have experienced 115 disasters that cost at least $1 billion, not including this year. ""It just seems like every year we have an increasing trend. And it's ticking up and up and up,"" Strader said. Part of this is due to human-caused climate change, which is making extreme weather events increasingly likely and intense . ""We're just going to see more intense storms,"" Ullrich said. ""They're going to intensify more rapidly as they make landfall, and you're going to see larger storm surge associated with them, which is going to affect coastal infrastructure."" ""Any sort of extreme storm, particularly ones producing heavy rainfall , [is] worsened by climate change — that is, they produce more precipitation because of warmer atmospheric conditions,"" Ullrich said. This effect was seen during the Texas flash floods in July, when a large storm dropped about a foot (30 centimeters) of water in just a few hours over the Texas Hill Country, in turn causing the Guadalupe River to rise by more than 26 feet (8 meters) and burst its banks. Flood losses are projected to increase by as much as 147% in Louisiana and 74% in Florida in 2050 relative to 2020's losses, according to Climate Central . Much of this will be driven by climate change, Climate Central found. But it's not just storms that are supercharged by climate change. ""We know that climate change is increasing the frequency and severity of fire weather — the hot, dry, windy conditions that are so conducive to the spreading of fire,"" Dahl said. The rapid transition between wet and dry conditions that fueled the LA blazes also may be worsened by climate change, research suggests . Overall, ""there's abundant and overwhelming evidence that climate change is increasing the severity and likelihood of extreme fire conditions in the American West,"" Swain told Live Science. In July, deadly flash floods left 135 people dead after heavy rainfall caused the Gaudaloupe River to burst its banks. (Image credit: Jim Vondruska via Getty Images) Expanding bull's-eye Land-use changes also contribute to the increased devastation of natural disasters. ""We sort of have this two-headed monster going on in the world, which is our climate is changing; we're having [worse] extreme weather,"" Strader said. At the same time, more people live in the U.S. and on the planet, which increases our exposure, he added. One factor that makes natural disasters more destructive is the expansion of urban areas . In 2017, 3.3% of the entire land area in the U.S. was urban — up from 2.2% in 1982 and just 0.8% in 1949. Population density has also increased, and the urban population has ballooned from 167 million in 1980 to 249 million in 2010 . This means there are more buildings and infrastructure to be destroyed, that weather events are more likely to hit urban areas, and that more people are affected when these areas are hit. Experts have dubbed this the "" expanding bull's-eye effect ."" Strader noted that the expanding bull's-eye effect creates a particular risk for tornadoes. ""We're not really seeing any change in the number of tornadoes,"" and those tornadoes aren't getting stronger, Strader said. Instead, tornadoes are now more damaging because we have built more homes and infrastructure in tornado-prone areas, he noted. In addition, we are modifying the land in ways that make some disasters more likely. Replacing open space with roads, for instance, can worsen flooding. ""If we've modified the environment to have more pavement versus open areas where water can percolate, then we may have increased that urban flood hazard, even if the rain hasn't changed and the size of the city hasn't changed,"" Swain said. Our actions have also worsened the risks of wildfires. In the past, small, low-intensity fires regularly cleared out brush and helped regenerate forests in the American West. But after a century of fire suppression, the wilderness is overgrown. ""There's a deficit of natural, beneficial fires,"" Swain said. This leads to a large buildup of fuel for wildfires, so when one does occur, it burns hotter, grows larger and is more devastating, Swain said. Deaths versus damages Even though natural disasters are becoming more frequent and destructive, more people aren't dying as a result. That's largely because warning systems and forecasting have improved, which, in turn, helps people get to safety in time, experts noted. However, as climate change worsens, forecasting may not prevent a rise in fatalities. ""The two biggest [disaster types] I worry about are heat and flooding,"" Strader said. ""When we have very high heat waves, it affects a huge portion of the country, and heat is something you can't escape from, especially if you're vulnerable"" or if you don't have resources, he added, noting that minority groups are particularly affected. Cities can become like ""concrete ovens"" — and while such extreme weather events may not always cause massive infrastructure damage, they can be as deadly as a massive hurricane or wildfire. For instance, a heat wave in the Midwest in September 1995 killed 872 people and caused $2 billion (inflation-adjusted) in damage, according to NOAA. But 2017's Hurricane Harvey — the second-most-destructive extreme event on record, which hit Texas and Louisiana — caused $160 billion (inflation-adjusted) of damage and just 89 deaths. And government policies could lead to more deaths in the short term, experts said. The government is looking to cut funding and staff headcount at the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), the Forest Service and NOAA . These cuts will likely lead to significant impacts , both in the near future and longer term, experts told Live Science. ""It is actually highly plausible that the cuts that are being done right now … will probably increase disaster losses. It's very much a self-inflicted wound,"" Swain said. ""The savings by cutting these programs are almost certainly to be far less than the costs incurred through greater disaster losses to come as a result of these objectively very short-sighted decisions.""",https://www.livescience.com/planet-earth/climate-change/extreme-weather-caused-more-than-usd100-billion-in-damage-by-june-smashing-us-records,Science,BBC,,https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/dtw6DHtdBLcXriBPzWZUEF-1920-80.jpg,2025-10-10T16:57:38+00:00,5014cffe411e899966778edc747e1f9295b9301c
d0c7e5d5eabb,Robots receive major intelligence boost thanks to Google DeepMind's 'thinking AI' — a pair of models that help machines understand the world,,"Google DeepMind has unveiled a pair of artificial intelligence (AI) models that will enable robots to perform complex general tasks and reason in a way that was previously impossible. Earlier this year, the company revealed the first iteration of Gemini Robotics, an AI model based on its Gemini large language model (LLM) — but specialized for robotics. This allowed machines to reason and perform simple tasks in physical spaces. The new models, dubbed Gemini Robotics 1.5 and Gemini Robotics-ER 1.5, greatly expand on the capabilities of the original version to handle multistep, ""long-horizon"" tasks and are a significant milestone towards robots assisting people in real-world use cases. The baseline example Google points to is the banana test. The original AI model was capable of receiving a simple instruction like ""place this banana in the basket,"" and guiding a robotic arm to complete that command. Powered by the two new models, a robot can now take a selection of fruit and sort them into individual containers based on color. In one demonstration, a pair of robotic arms (the company's Aloha 2 robot) accurately sorts a banana, an apple and a lime onto three plates of the appropriate color. Further, the robot explains in natural language what it's doing and why as it performs the task. Gemini Robotics 1.5: Thinking while acting - YouTube Watch On ""We enable it to think,"" said Jie Tan , a senior staff research scientist at DeepMind, in the video. ""It can perceive the environment, think step-by-step and then finish this multistep task. Although this example seems very simple, the idea behind it is really powerful. The same model is going to power more sophisticated humanoid robots to do more complicated daily tasks."" AI-powered robotics of tomorrow While the demonstration may seem simple on the surface, it demonstrates a number of sophisticated capabilities. The robot can spatially locate the fruit and the plates, identify the fruit and the color of all of the objects, match the fruit to the plates according to shared characteristics and provide a natural language output describing its reasoning. Get the world’s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox. It's all possible because of the way the newest iterations of the AI models interact. They work together in much the same way a supervisor and worker do. Google Robotics-ER 1.5 (the ""brain"") is a vision-language model (VLM) that gathers information about a space and the objects located within it, processes natural language commands and can utilize advanced reasoning and tools to send instructions to Google Robotics 1.5 (the ""hands and eyes""), a vision-language-action (VLA) model. Google Robotics 1.5 matches those instructions to its visual understanding of a space and builds a plan before executing them, providing feedback about its processes and reasoning throughout. The two models are more capable than previous versions and can use tools like Google Search to complete tasks. The team demonstrated this capacity by having a researcher ask Aloha to use recycling rules based on her location to sort some objects into compost, recycling and trash bins. The robot recognized that the user was located in San Francisco and found recycling rules on the internet to help it accurately sort trash into the appropriate receptacles. Another advance represented in the new models is the ability to learn (and apply that learning) across multiple robotics systems. DeepMind representatives said in a statement that any learning gleaned across its Aloha 2 robot (the pair of robotics arms), Apollo humanoid robot and bi-arm Franka robot can be applied to any other system due to the generalized way the models learn and evolve. ""General-purpose robots need a deep understanding of the physical world, advanced reasoning, and general and dexterous control,"" the Gemini Robotics Team said in a technical report on the new models. That kind of generalized reasoning means that the models can approach a problem with a broad understanding of physical spaces and interactions and problem-solve accordingly, breaking tasks down into small, individual steps that can be easily executed. This contrasts with earlier approaches, which relied on specialized knowledge that only applied to very specific, narrow situations and individual robots. The scientists provided an additional example of how robots could help in a real-world scenario. They presented an Apollo robot with two bins and asked it to sort clothes by color — with whites going into one bin and other colors into the other. They then added an additional hurdle as the task progressed by moving the clothes and bins around, forcing the robot to reevaluate the physical space and react accordingly, which it managed successfully.",https://www.livescience.com/technology/robotics/robots-receive-major-intelligence-boost-thanks-to-google-deepminds-thinking-ai-a-pair-of-models-that-help-machines-understand-the-world,Science,BBC,,https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/dQiA3iqMCPukcRaejD9Skd-1600-80.png,2025-10-10T12:10:00+00:00,7b920d456ccb7901a6a64f5439c27b4597921268
47b1875e1b41,Coral Triangle: The giant hidden 'Amazon' beneath the sea that appears somewhat resilient to climate change,,"QUICK FACTS Name: Coral Triangle Location: Ocean around the Solomon Islands, Papua New Guinea, Timor-Leste, parts of Indonesia and Malaysia, and the Philippines Why it's incredible: The Coral Triangle is home to 76% of known coral species in the world. The Coral Triangle is a tropical marine region between the Pacific and Indian oceans where 76% of Earth's coral species are found. It encompasses 2.3 million square miles (6 million square kilometers) of ocean around the Philippines, Indonesia and Papua New Guinea, and stretches south to Timor-Leste and as far east as the Solomon Islands. Biodiversity in the Coral Triangle is much higher than in other regions with coral reefs, such as the Caribbean Sea and the southwest Pacific Ocean. Around 605 reef-building coral species inhabit the Coral Triangle — 10 times the number in the Caribbean Sea, according to an article from the U.K.'s Natural History Museum (NHM). These corals provide a home for six of the world's seven sea turtle species and 37% of the world's coral reef fish species, as well as marine mammals like dolphins, dugongs, blue whales and sperm whales, according to the NHM article. This incredible array of species has earned the Coral Triangle the nickname the ""Amazon of the sea."" ""This part of the world contains the highest diversity of marine species,"" Nadia Santodomingo , a coral expert and marine biologist at the NHM, said in the article. ""Scientists have been trying to understand why it's so diverse for a very long time."" In fact, British naturalist and explorer Alfred Russel Wallace was working there when Charles Darwin was alive, trying to solve the same problem, she added. Wallace traveled through the Malay Archipelago between mainland Southeast Asia and Australia, collecting specimens and developing theories regarding the region's staggering biodiversity. He came up with what scientists call the ""Wallace Line"" — a gigantic biological boundary that separates the Oriental and Australian faunal regions — and proposed the theory of evolution by natural selection around the same time as Darwin. Scientists today have more tools at their disposal to understand the region, with evidence suggesting that murkier conditions in the Coral Triangle compared with other shallow tropical waters may provide a haven for different species. The Coral Triangle has been a biodiversity hotspot for at least the past 20 million years, and this is partly thanks to a huge variety of habitat types and optimal conditions for larvae that ride on ocean currents, according to the nongovernmental organization Blue Corner Marine Research . Research also suggests that the Coral Triangle has a plethora of species simply because diversity built up over time . Unlike temperate and polar marine regions that have undergone glaciations, tropical regions like the Coral Triangle have remained relatively stable. And what sets this region apart from other tropical seas is its unique, platform-like geology and location at the intersection between two oceans, researchers say . Get the world’s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox. The Coral Triangle is located between the Pacific and Indian oceans. (Image credit: Main_sail/Getty Images) Like other coral reef regions, the Coral Triangle is vulnerable to overfishing, pollution from coastal development, and ocean acidification linked to climate change — although scientists think its murky conditions may shield it somewhat.

606c15417f86,New species of Jurassic 'sword dragon' could help solve an evolutionary mystery,,"A nearly complete fossil skeleton found on the U.K.'s Jurassic Coast represents a newly identified species of ancient marine reptile that lived alongside dinosaurs. The ichthyosaur, dubbed Xiphodracon goldencapsis , was likely around 10 feet (3 meters) long when it lived, according to a study published Friday (Oct. 10) in the journal Papers in Palaeontology . It had large eye sockets and a long, narrow snout shaped like a sword. The specimen dates to a period in the Early Jurassic known as the Pliensbachian, which lasted from about 193 million to 184 million years ago. By studying an ichthyosaur fossil from this period, scientists could learn more about a critical point in these aquatic animals' evolution, according to the study. Fossil collector Chris Moore found the remains in 2001 along the Jurassic Coast, a 96-mile (154 kilometers) stretch of seaboard in Dorset known for being a treasure trove of fossils. Moore sold the fossil to the Royal Ontario Museum in Canada shortly thereafter. Although it was identified as an ichthyosaur, it wasn't studied in detail until recently. ""I remember seeing the skeleton for the first time in 2016,"" study co-author Dean Lomax , a paleontologist at the University of Manchester and the University of Bristol, said in a statement . ""Back then, I knew it was unusual, but I did not expect it to play such a pivotal role in helping to fill a gap in our understanding of a complex faunal turnover during the Pliensbachian."" The ichthyosaur appears to suffered a bite wound to the head by a larger predator, and had malformed bones and teeth indicating serious injury or disease. (Image credit: Dean Lomax, Judy Massare, and Erin Maxwell) The new genus name, Xiphodracon , comes from the Greek words ""xiphos,"" meaning sword, and ""dracon,"" meaning dragon — a reference to ichthyosaurs' ""sea dragons"" nickname. Its species name, ""goldencapsis,"" comes from Golden Cap, the site on the Jurassic Coast where the ichthyosaur was found. Get the world’s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox. The fossil also hints at how the individual ichthyosaur lived and died. ""The limb bones and teeth are malformed in such a way that points to serious injury or disease while the animal was still alive, and the skull appears to have been bitten by a large predator — likely another much larger species of ichthyosaur — giving us a cause of death for this individual,"" study co-author Erin Maxwell , curator of fossil aquatic vertebrates at the State Museum of Natural History Stuttgart in Germany, said in the statement. ""Life in the Mesozoic oceans was a dangerous prospect."" X. goldencapsis could also help to clarify a major shift in ichthyosaur speciation in the early Jurassic. Although scientists have found many ichthyosaur fossils from before and after the Pliensbachian, the two groups have very few species in common, suggesting a major turnover sometime during the Pliensbachian. In fact, ichthyosaur fossils from the Pliensbachian period are rare. The newly discovered ichthyosaur ""is more closely related to species in the later Early Jurassic … and its discovery helps pinpoint when the faunal turnover occurred, being much earlier than expected,"" Lomax said. In other words, the shift likely occurred in the early Pliensbachian. However, scientists don't yet know what caused this upheaval. For now, the X. goldencapsis fossil will be displayed at the Royal Ontario Museum.",https://www.livescience.com/animals/extinct-species/new-species-of-jurassic-sword-dragon-could-help-solve-an-evolutionary-mystery,Science,BBC,,https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/xaubTnbRejWWbReoGpTD93-1920-80.jpg,2025-10-10T00:00:00+00:00,a0fe6aaab39f77b381bbf42ee29a372084b7605b
c32a89f00f96,Ancient Roman tombstone found beneath undergrowth in New Orleans yard,,"When clearing undergrowth in their New Orleans yard one day, a married couple discovered something completely unexpected: a Roman headstone that had once marked the grave of a soldier who lived half the world away in the second century. Research into the unlikely object indicates that it is genuine, and its discovery hints at an international mystery that dates back to World War II. "" We get calls from the public about odd finds in yards in the area pretty often,"" University of New Orleans archaeologist D. Ryan Gray , who analyzed the headstone, told Live Science. ""Often it turns out to be something natural that just happens to look like an artifact."" In this case, the homeowners were Daniella Santoro , an anthropologist at Tulane University, and her husband Aaron Lorenz, Gray noted in an Oct. 6 online report about the investigations into the stone. ""When Daniella initially described this, I thought maybe it was a 19th-century gravestone that had been scavenged from a New Orleans cemetery and then discarded,"" Gray said. ""However, as soon as I saw the photo of the inscription, I immediately suspected this was something very different."" Ancient gravestone Santoro had found the unusual marble tablet beneath the undergrowth in the backyard of her ""shotgun"" house in the city's historic Carrollton neighborhood. The stone is about 12 inches (30 centimeters) wide and slightly longer, and one surface is densely chiseled with Roman text. Experts say the Latin inscription can be translated to English and reads: ""To the Spirits of the Dead for Sextus Congenius Verus, soldier of the praetorian fleet Misenensis, from the tribe of the Bessi [of Thrace], (who) lived 42 years (and) served 22 in the military, on the trireme [warship] Asclepius.

Lingering mystery An investigation revealed that the inscription had already been recorded by archaeologists — but on a second-century grave marker found near Civitavecchia, an ancient city and port about 40 miles (64 kilometers) northwest of Rome. That headstone was reported missing after World War II, however, when Allied bombs destroyed the museum that housed it. It's not entirely clear what happened next, but Gray listed a few ideas in his report: maybe a U.S. soldier passing through Civitavecchia after the Allies liberated Rome in 1944 had acquired it as a souvenir; or maybe it was acquired after the war by an antiquities dealer, who then sold it to a tourist, he said. Santoro and Lorenz are now working with authorities in the U.S. and Italy to return the gravestone to Civitavecchia. ""For me, this story reflects a wonderful intersection of a homeowner's curiosity ultimately bringing to light something unexpected and historically significant,"" Gray wrote in his report.

ca8a0cd38dec,200-foot scorpion effigy mound in Mexico may align with the solstices,,"A gigantic scorpion-shaped mound built centuries ago in Mexico may align with the winter and summer solstices, a new study finds. Archaeologists documented the 205-foot-long (62.5 meter) mound in 2014 while surveying prehistoric irrigation systems in Tehuacán Valley, about 160 miles (260 kilometers) southeast of Mexico City. Several artifacts and offerings were found at the scorpion mound, which helped the team date it to the Late Classic and Early Postclassic periods (circa A.D. 600 to 1100). The scorpion effigy mound has remained remarkably intact over the centuries. It has a head, body, pincers and tail sculpted with a mix of dirt and rocks that are piled up to 31 inches (80 centimeters) high. The team found buried artifacts where the ""stinger"" would have been. ""This sort of effigy feature is quite unusual in Mesoamerica,"" the researchers wrote in the study, which was published Aug. 29 in the journal Ancient Mesoamerica . The discovery also suggests that regular Mesoamericans, not just the elite, were looking to the sky and monitoring astronomical events, said study first author James Neely , a professor emeritus of archaeology at the University of Texas at Austin. ""It is the first indication that knowledge and control of astronomical phenomena based on solar observations was not totally in control of the elite class,"" Neely told Live Science in an email. Astronomical observatory The scorpion is one of 12 mounds, which appear to be part of a civic and ceremonial complex that spans about 22 acres (9 hectares) and includes what may be a looted burial or storage pit. This complex may have been used for astronomical observation, helping agricultural workers know when to perform rituals and plant and harvest their crops, the team said. Get the world’s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox. A sketch to scale of the scorpion effigy mound in the Tehuacán Valley of Mexico. (Image credit: Courtesy of Blas Castellón) Some of the mounds have rooms and walls, but only the scorpion has a specific shape, making it an effigy mound — or piled dirt that is purposefully formed into a specific shape, symbol or figure. While thousands of earthen mounds built by Indigenous Americans are found in North America, effigy mounds are ""notably sparce"" in Mesoamerica, making the scorpion one a rare find. The scorpion, known as Tlāhuizcalpantēcuhtli, was a powerful deity in pre-Hispanic Mesoamerica. Many Mesoamerican peoples saw it as a celestial deity and a prominent figure in the Aztec pantheon of gods. To Mesoamericans, Tlāhuizcalpantēcuhtli represented Venus , the morning star planet, the researchers wrote in the study. While studying the scorpion effigy mound, the team noticed that it was oriented east-northeast, a clue that it aligns with sunrise on the summer solstice , they wrote in the paper. To investigate, the researchers calculated the sun ’s trajectory on both the summer and winter solstices. ""We estimate that on the morning of the summer solstice, if a person sighted from the 'stinger' (the circular ceramic cluster at the presumed end of the scorpion’s tail), the sun would rise above the tip of the northern (left) claw,"" they wrote in the study.

(Image credit: Courtesy of Blas Castellón) Archaeologists found a molcajete offering at the scorpion effigy mound. We see (left) the way the artifact was found and (right), the artifact with the cover bowl taken off. The summer solstice was an important ceremonial date in Mesoamerica, as it kicked off the beginning of the rainy and planting season, the researchers noted. ""For the days leading up to the solstice, the sun would rise between the two claws, and thereby signal the approach of the rainy season so the local farmers could prepare their fields for planting,"" the researchers added. Likewise, the sunset on the winter solstice also connected with the scorpion effigy mound. If a person stood at the tip of the left claw, they could see the setting sun beyond the stinger, the team found. ""Based on these estimates, the [scorpion] mound would allow its users to identify the dates of both the summer and winter solstices, common alignments for Mesoamerican architecture,"" the researchers wrote in the study. Among the artifacts found at the scorpion effigy mound were bowls, jars and plate fragments. The archaeologists also found molcajetes — tripod bowls that were used for grinding food — as well as an incense burner and the fragment of a hollow figurine that was likely involved in a ritual, they wrote. The discovery of the mounds and astronomical observatory among the irrigation canals shows the complexity of the Mesoamerican civilization that built them, Neely said, adding that ""this points to the prehistoric campesinos [countryside farmers] having lived a life way of greater independence and self-determination from elite/state control as do their modern counterparts.""",https://www.livescience.com/archaeology/200-foot-scorpion-effigy-mound-in-mexico-may-align-with-the-solstices,Science,BBC,,https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/TMQmzkn4XQ8yeTrwV4cVu5-2233-80.jpg,2025-10-09T17:30:00+00:00,8388899cd7bc6bc86df136d35a40a60317ad9ca3

Researchers observed the comet scattering water unusually early in a discovery that sheds light on how the building blocks of life are distributed across other planetary systems. Initial James Webb Space Telescope observations have suggested that 3I/ATLAS has a high carbon dioxide (CO2) to water (H2O) ratio . In the new study, published Sep. 30 in The Astrophysical Journal Letters , researchers explored water activity on the comet and provided the first clear evidence that it was shedding water while still remarkably far from the sun. ""When we detect water — or even its faint ultraviolet echo, OH — from an interstellar comet, we're reading a note from another planetary system,"" study co-author Dennis Bodewits , a professor of physics at Auburn University in Alabama, said in a statement . ""It tells us that the ingredients for life's chemistry are not unique to our own."" NASA 's Neil Gehrels Swift space observatory detected hydroxyl (OH) gas, an ultraviolet by-product of water, coming off the comet when it was nearly three times farther from the sun than Earth (2.9 astronomical units away), much farther away than the region of our solar system where water ice typically turns to gas on passing comets . Researchers calculated that the comet was shedding about 88 pounds (40 kilograms) of water per second, which is about the equivalent of a fire hose running at full blast, according to the statement released by the researchers. Since its discovery in July, scientists have been using various telescopes to learn all they can about 3I/ATLAS. Their findings so far indicate that the comet is zooming through our solar system at speeds in excess of 130,000 mph (210,000 km/h) in an unusually flat and straight trajectory . Get the world’s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox. 3I/ATLAS is likely the largest interstellar object ever seen , though researchers are still pinning down its exact size. Hubble Space Telescope data suggest that 3I/ATLAS has a maximum width of about 3.5 miles (5.6 km). 3I/ATLAS could also be the oldest comet ever seen , with one study suggesting it's around 3 billion years older than our 4.6 billion-year-old solar system . For the new study, researchers used observations made with the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory's ultraviolet and optical telescope in July and August. The researchers suggested that the ultraviolet hydroxyl signal could be the result of sunlight heating small icy grains on the nucleus (head) of the comet, causing them to vaporize into gas. 3I/ATLAS is only the third interstellar comet ever recorded, following the discovery of the cigar-shaped 1I/'Oumuamua comet in 2017 and the pristine 2I/Borisov comet in 2019. So far, each interstellar visitor has had some differing characteristics, suggesting that there could be a variety of comet and planet-forming environments in the universe. ""Every interstellar comet so far has been a surprise,"" study lead author Zexi Xing , a postdoctoral researcher at Auburn University, said in the statement.

f36689f0177e,Groundbreaking image shows two black holes orbiting each other for first time,,"For the first time ever, astronomers have imaged two black holes orbiting each other, finally offering visual proof for the existence of black hole pairs. Spotted through the faint fluctuations of radio light captured by telescopes both on the ground and in space, the two black holes are locked in a 12-year orbit some 5 billion light-years from Earth. The smaller black hole was captured with a jet of near-light speed particles twisting around like a rotating garden hose or a dog's wagging tail. The larger black hole, producing a bigger cosmic fountain known as the blazar OJ287, is a supermassive monster with a mass roughly 18 billion times greater than our sun. The researchers published their findings Oct. 9 in The Astrophysical Journal . ""For the first time, we managed to get an image of two black holes circling each other,"" study first author Mauri Valtonen , an astronomer at the University of Turku in Finland, said in a statement . ""In the image, the black holes are identified by the intense particle jets they emit. The black holes themselves are perfectly black, but they can be detected by these particle jets or by the glowing gas surrounding the hole."" Black holes are born from the collapse of giant stars and grow by gorging on gas, dust, stars and other black holes. For some of these gluttonous space-time ruptures, friction causes the material spiraling into their maws to heat up and emit light that telescopes can detect, turning them into so-called active galactic nuclei (AGN). The most extreme AGN are quasars — supermassive black holes billions of times heavier than the sun that shed their gaseous cocoons by shooting out light blasts trillions of times more luminous than the brightest stars. When these jets are pointed toward Earth’s line of sight, they are known as blazars. Astronomers have previously imaged the supermassive giants at the center of our Milky Way and in the nearby galaxy Messier 87 , and ample evidence for black hole binaries and their mergers appears in detections of gravitational waves . Yet despite long-held suspicions that OJ287 contained an orbiting pair, telescopes lacked the resolution to separate them from a single dot. Get the world’s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox. In fact, observations of OJ287 go back before astronomers even knew black holes existed; its semi-periodic flares in intensity were included in late 19th century photographic plates made to study nearby cosmic objects. Revisiting data taken from these plates and in follow-up observations led astronomers to begin speculating in the 1980s that the system's regular dimming and brightening was caused by two orbiting black holes. To arrive at visual proof, the astronomers used a radio image obtained by a network that includes the RadioAstron, or Spektr-R, satellite — a Russian scientific satellite carrying a radio telescope operational from 2011 to 2019. A thereotical diagram (left) showing where the black holes and their jets were at the time of the image, and the radio image (right). (Image credit: Valtonen et al, 2025.)

""In recent years, we have only been able to use Earth-based telescopes, where the image resolution is not as good."" Comparing the features in the image to past calculations, the researchers distinguished two components corresponding to the jets of each black hole appearing exactly where the theory suggests they should. Yet some wrinkles remain: The researchers caution that the two jets in the image could overlap, meaning that the possibility can't yet be fully excluded that there is only one.

fa0a7b6d1ed6,Chemo hurts both cancerous and healthy cells. But scientists think nanoparticles could help fix that.,,"When the first cells appeared on Earth approximately 3.8 billion years ago , viruses were already here to greet them . Ever since, viruses have been devising ways to infect cells, and cells have been responding by evolving ways to stop these infections. This evolutionary dance eventually led to the development of your immune system. A key aspect of your immune system is to distinguish ""self"" from ""nonself "" so it can destroy and remove foreign materials from your body. While this immune reaction protects you from viruses , it also has implications for how well foreign materials such as medications work. I am a researcher studying ways to make drugs work better , including how to get them to the site of disease within the body before being removed or destroyed. One way to do this is to encapsulate drugs in nanoparticles — materials small enough to be taken up by cells. While these materials still trigger an immune response to get them out of the body, scientists like me have found that this reaction could actually be used to improve the effectiveness of cancer treatment . The immune system and drug delivery In addition to detecting pathogens, your immune system also responds to tissue damage. You might observe this reaction as inflammation — such as redness and swelling — when drugs are injected into your body with a needle. Typically this inflammatory response is minimal. But the potential for a sustained reaction increases when drugs are administered slowly over a prolonged period of time, such as during chemotherapy infusions that can take an hour or more. For this reason, some patients are given anti-inflammatory medications before infusion to reduce the potential for an adverse immune response during treatment. The most recent breakthroughs in getting drugs into the body is using nanoparticles. These materials — which can be made from lipids, proteins, gold or other components — have the advantage of being very small: The diameter of a typical nanoparticle is about 10-thousandths of a millimeter . Their small size allows diseased cells to easily take them up. So when nanoparticles contain drugs, they can act as a drug delivery system. The Mighty Power of Nanomaterials: Crash Course Engineering #23 - YouTube Watch On Despite being so small, nanoparticles can hold a large number of drug molecules , allowing them to deliver a potent cargo of treatment directly into a cell. They can also deliver drugs made of DNA and RNA . The most well-known example of this technology is the COVID-19 vaccine , which uses nanoparticles made of modified fat molecules to deliver mRNA that teaches the immune system to protect itself against COVID-19 infection. Get the world’s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox. Your innate immune system also identifies nanoparticles as foreign invaders when they are injected into your body. As a result, some patients experience an initial inflammatory reaction when the body tries to attack the nanoparticle. But what if this reaction could actually be used to improve treatment? Exploiting the innate immune response For the past 30 years, my laboratory at the University of Colorado has been studying how nanoparticles deliver drugs. More recently, we have focused on understanding how the innate immune system responds to an injection of nanoparticles. While this immune reaction is typically considered a drawback, we wanted to explore whether it could enhance therapy. In a 2022 study on how nanoparticles affect the immune response in mice, we found that the innate immune response triggered by an initial dose of nanoparticles carrying a drug will also reduce the effects of a second dose if it is injected shortly afterward — typically within days. It does this by clearing the drug out from the body more quickly. This reaction is similar to how an initial viral infection would trigger a short-term protective response against a subsequent infection from another virus. Nanoparticles — the yellow dots — can be designed to home in on cancer cells, which are blue. (Image credit: NIH ) One critical aspect of this protective effect involves the production of a protein called interferon lambda . This molecule ""interferes"" with the infection process by restricting viruses from gaining access to different tissues in the body. Researchers have previously tested this protein as a potential antiviral drug to treat COVID-19 . Similarly, the interferon lambda made in response to the first dose of nanoparticles limits the ability of the second dose to deliver the drug to healthy tissues in the body. However, it did not affect the nanoparticle's ability to access tumors, possibly because tumors can impair the immune response . In conventional cancer treatment, chemotherapy drugs are used to kill the tumor. Because these drugs are also toxic to healthy cells, patients often experience side effects such as hair loss, gastrointestinal problems and skin rashes. Using nanoparticles to deliver cancer treatment could help reduce these side effects, and combining them with interferon lambda could allow the nanoparticle-encapsulated drug to stay in the body long enough to have its full effects. Our team is studying whether directly injecting interferon lambda before chemotherapy with nanoparticles could help limit the amount of drug that ends up in healthy tissues while increasing their concentration in tumors. In an initial test of this strategy in mice with colon cancer, all mice that received interferon lambda saw increased survival time and reduced weight loss. A better understanding of how this effect happens could help researchers eventually test this approach to cancer treatment in human patients. Scientists have a long way to go in developing nanoparticles that are as efficient as viruses at getting into cells. But our hope is that exploiting an immune response that evolved approximately a billion years ago to prevent viral infections could help reduce the toxic side effects from treatment while improving its effectiveness.

4d2773ee1c55,James Webb telescope may have spotted controversial 'dark stars' in the far universe,,"The second most distant object ever spotted by the James Webb telescope may be a 'dark star' powered by dark matter rather than nuclear fusion. By looking at the wavelengths of light picked up by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), researchers have identified four dark star candidates — with one seemingly possessing a “smoking gun” helium absorption signature, the researchers reported in a study published Sept. 30 in the journal PNAS . First hypothesized in 2007, dark stars are believed to be among some of the first stars — called Population III stars — to form after the Big Bang . According to the theory, they are made when collapsing hydrogen and helium, which on their own would form a black hole, mix with dark matter. Dark stars are thought to be extraordinarily massive and bright, reaching one million times the mass of the sun and burning one billion times as bright. ""Our initial name 'dark star' is a misnomer,"" study co-author Katherine Freese , a professor of physics at The University of Texas at Austin who proposed the dark star hypothesis, told Live Science. ""They're neither made [entirely] of dark matter nor are they dark."" Finding dark stars could explain some of the very puzzling objects that JWST has spotted in the early universe, such as the giant supermassive black holes that formed impossibly fast , Freese said. It would also provide insights into the nature of dark matter. ""It's a probe, not just a new kind of star,"" she said, ""so these candidates are very encouraging to us."" To spot the potential dark star candidates, the team trawled through observations from the JWST Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey (JADES). They focused on data collected by the Near InfraRed Spectrograph (NIRSpec): an instrument measuring the individual wavelengths of light coming from celestial objects to learn about their temperatures, masses and chemical fingerprints. The researchers set various criteria in their search: the signals needed to be no younger than redshift 10 (a redward stretching of the universe’s ancient light corresponding to 500 million years after the Big Bang), could only contain hydrogen and helium, and had to be from a single object. Get the world’s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox. This led them to four dark star candidates: JADES-GS-z11-0, JADES-GS-z13-0, JADES-GS-z14-0 and JADES-GS-z14-1. JADES-GS-z14-0 is the second most distant object observed by JWST to date. Signals from the first stars Models of each candidate showed that all four could plausibly be dark stars, perhaps even supermassive dark stars. The team also found hints of the “smoking gun signature” for supermassive dark stars in the JADES-GS-z14-0 wavelength data — singly ionized helium atoms absorbing light particles with a wavelength of 1640 angstroms (an angstrom is one hundred-million times smaller than a centimeter). ""No other known high redshift objects are expected to produce such an absorption feature,"" the authors wrote in the study, adding weight to their suggestion that JADES-GS-z14-0 is a dark star. The team were surprised to discover, however, that the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) in Chile had detected JADES-GS-z14-0 emitting oxygen , an element only produced by nuclear fusion powered stars. ""That worries me a little bit,"" Freese said. The team are now running simulations to determine how much oxygen is permitted before a dark star is no longer able to form, study co-author Cosmin Ilie , a physicist at Colgate University in New York, told Live Science. ""Logic tells me that there should be sort of a transition,"" he said. Dark stars remain controversial and their existence is by no means accepted. ""The majority of the Pop III star community actually doesn't think that dark matter burners [dark stars] can form,"" Daniel Whalen , a cosmologist at the University of Portsmouth in the U.K. who was not involved in the research, told Live Science. In fact, Whalen said that a ""huge issue"" with this research is that it did not differentiate between dark stars and supermassive primordial stars . ""That's the elephant in the room really here,"" he said. Although the dark star candidates are more massive than most supermassive primordial stars, their wavelength data needs to be compared for both star types to rule out supermassive primordial stars, Whalen explained. In response to this criticism, Ilie said that because supermassive primordial stars don't live as long as dark stars, if many suitable signatures are identified they are statistically more likely to be dark stars. That means many more observations are needed to settle this mystery. Meanwhile, Freese said that the team is working on automating the search for dark stars in the JWST data ""so we don't have to do anything except keep our eyes open.""",https://www.livescience.com/space/cosmology/james-webb-telescope-may-have-spotted-controversial-dark-stars-in-the-far-universe,Science,BBC,,https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/wnmeHkvAwMTSavjfKJxMjf-1920-80.jpg,2025-10-09T15:49:02+00:00,131ddaf0f04ff5e9a3d062917058a7b93a8d839f
602164c601ec,"Satellites detected strange gravity signal coming from deep within Earth almost 20 years ago, study reveals",,"Satellites detected a strange gravity signal off the coast of Africa nearly 20 years ago, suggesting something unusual had happened deep within the planet to distort its gravitational field, according to a recent study. The large gravitational anomaly lasted for about two years over the eastern Atlantic Ocean. It peaked in January 2007, the same month Steve Jobs announced the first iPhone (though, of course, there was no connection between the two events). Researchers recently discovered the signal while analyzing data collected by the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellites between 2003 and 2015. The gravitational anomaly happened around the same time as a geomagnetic ""jerk"" — an abrupt change in the variation of Earth's magnetic field . The strange anomaly, and the jerk, were caused by a previously unknown geological process, the researchers suspect. Their findings, published Aug. 28 in the journal Geophysical Research Letters , indicated that a shift in minerals may have caused a rapid redistribution of mass in the deep mantle, near the core, altering Earth's magnetic field. Study co-author Mioara Mandea — a geophysicist at the National Centre for Space Studies (CNES) in France and a principal investigator for the European Research Council's Gravimetry, Magnetism, Rotation and Core Flow project — told Live Science that she questioned the validity of the signal at first. ""As is often the case in scientific research, my initial response was one of questioning: is the signal genuine, how can it be validated, and how should it be interpreted?"" Mandea said in an email. ""While the result and its publication were certainly a source of satisfaction, the dominant thought was to consider the next steps and possible implications."" The GRACE satellites were a pair of identical spacecraft operated as part of a joint mission between NASA and the German Aerospace Center (DLR). Scientists used these satellites, which were active from 2002 until they ran out of fuel in 2017, to measure variations in Earth's gravity. The satellites moved in tandem (one behind the other) around Earth, and researchers measured the distance between the two objects to look for any changes that occurred as a result of variation in Earth's gravitational force, according to NASA . Get the world’s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox. Such gravity variations are often caused by variations in the concentration of mass — more mass means more gravity. For example, water currents shift mass around in the ocean, which can lead to localized variations in Earth's gravitational field. In the new study, the researchers scoured GRACE data for anomalous gravity signals that potentially originated deep within Earth, rather than from water shifting on or near the surface. The signal was a north-south-oriented gravity anomaly, stretching about 4,350 miles (7,000 kilometers) — close to the length of the entire African continent — from 2006 to 2008, according to the study. Researchers are still learning about Earth’s deep mantle and the boundary between the rocky layer and our planet’s liquid outer core , but the lower section of the mantle is largely made up of magnesium silicate (MgSiO 3 ). The study authors suggested that the mass redistributions they attributed to the signal occurred as a result of a perovskite to post-perovskite phase transformation in this lower mantle section, whereby the structure of magnesium silicate changed under pressure, shifting mass deep within the Earth. Mandea noted that the main message of the study was that Earth is complex and that different datasets and methods are required to understand its internal processes. ""Earth is a complex system that must be studied using diverse datasets and complementary methods of analysis,"" Mandea said. ""This synergy gives us the opportunity to uncover and better understand hidden processes in the Earth's deep interior.""",https://www.livescience.com/planet-earth/geology/satellites-detected-strange-gravity-signal-coming-from-deep-within-earth-almost-20-years-ago-study-reveals,Science,BBC,,https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/DV3iBjP7SFRrGGq9CmtnLS-1440-80.jpg,2025-10-09T12:04:57+00:00,815bd0818dc25a1c517d0074acc98cb8c5eaeeb6
2751e2cf8bcd,"Prime Day deals extended: There's still a chance to save on cameras, binoculars and telescopes",,"Amazon Prime Day in October is over, but there's still a chance to save on the best telescopes , binoculars , cameras and star projectors . We've searched the web to find deals that are still live, and some of them are actually cheaper than they were during Prime Day.

Our optics writer bought this telescope last year, and has enjoyed many evenings observing Saturn's rings, several of Jupiter's moons and some brighter deep space objects. Comes with two eyepieces, finderscope, counterweights, tripod and EQ mount.

Featured in: Best telescopes , Best beginner telescopes

If you're new to telescopes and want to get a better look at the upcoming supermoons on November 5 and December 4, this Newtonian telescope is a good choice to start your stargazing journey. It's $25 more than it was for Prime Day, but we still think it's a good price.

With the Unistellar Odyssey Pro, you get the intelligence of a smart telescope with the experience of observational astronomy, thanks to the Nikon eyepiece. Just choose a target from the list of visible subjects, and the Odyssey Pro will automatically locate and track it, while you sit back and enjoy the view from either your phone/tablet or through the eyepiece.

These big astronomy binoculars have a whopping 20x magnification for detailed views of the moon, plus a great view of Jupiter's moons, star clusters and some deep-sky objects. They need to be mounted on a tripod, but the payoff is worth it. We gave them 4 stars in our full review .

'Best overall' in Best binoculars for stargazing

We recently conducted a group test of Celestron binoculars, with the Nature DX ED ranking higher than both the standard Nature DX and TrailSeeker models. The ED glass eliminates chromatic aberration entirely, making it excellent for birdwatching, handheld stargazing and general use without breaking the bank. They're $9 more than Prime Day, but they're still an excellent price.

Excellent, budget-friendly binoculars that are surprisingly good for the money. We own the 15x magnification variant, so this 25x will produce even more detailed views of the moon, Jupiter's moons and bright deep-space objects.

These binoculars from Celestron are perfect for sweeping across the night sky without the need for a tripod. The 7x magnification is good for picking out stars you can't see with the naked eye, and the large 50mm objective lenses are ideal for low-light environments. Plus, they're only $36 — it's a no-brainer.

If you want to buy your first camera and jump straight into the full-frame market, the Canon EOS R8 is a fine choice, and it's the exact same price as it was during Prime Day. It produces beautiful images, handles noise well and is lightweight and user-friendly. We think it's one of the best beginner cameras out there, and we gave it 4.5 stars in our review .

If video is important to you alongside stills photography, look no further than the Panasonic LUMIX S5 IIX. This deal includes two lenses, and we awarded the camera 5 out of 5 stars in our full review . Plus, it's exactly the same price it was during Prime Day.

Another star projector to rival the Pococo and Orzorz, it projects real images via discs onto any surface — it's far more than just a pretty space-themed light. Not only is it a great educational tool, but the motor is nearly silent, making it perfect to fall asleep to.

55bbfe4a0b26,Scientists discover gold nanoparticles hidden in spruce tree needles,,"When Burl Ives sang ""Silver and gold decorations, on every Christmas tree"" in ""Rudolph the Red-nosed Reindeer,"" he surely didn't know that Christmas trees actually have gold inside their needles — but that's exactly what new research has found. A study published Aug. 28 in the journal Environmental Microbiome reports that Norway spruce trees ( Picea abies ) concentrate gold nanoparticles with the help of their resident bacteria. ""Our results suggest that bacteria and other microbes living inside plants may influence the accumulation of gold in trees,"" lead study author Kaisa Lehosmaa , an ecologist at the University of Oulu in Finland, said in a statement . These resident bacteria are known as endophytes — symbiotic microorganisms that facilitate hormone production and nutrient absorption, among other functions. In the spruce trees, these bacteria segregate soluble gold particles that the trees take up in water through their roots. The process is a form of biomineralization, in which living things control the formation of minerals in their tissues through a wide array of processes. In this case, the endophytes likely concentrated the particles to reduce their toxicity. Striking gold For the study, the researchers investigated spruce trees near the Kittilä mine in northern Finland — the largest producer of gold in Europe. The researchers examined 138 needle samples from 23 spruce trees. Needles from four of the trees contained gold nanoparticles. The nanoparticles were surrounded by biofilms created by bacterial genera such as P3OB-42 , Cutibacterium and Corynebacterium . These films are polysaccharide (complex sugars) and protein compounds secreted by the bacteria that allow them to persist within the plant tissues. Get the world’s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox. The close association between the nanoparticles and bacterial biofilms indicated that the bacteria were likely responsible for isolating the mineral. The diversity of bacterial species was lower in needles that contained gold; other studies of plants with high concentrations of metals in their tissues have also found decreased microbial biodiversity. No one will be making a fortune by cutting down spruces to distill the tiny amounts of gold in their needles — the particles measure a mere millionth of a millimeter. However, the trees' uptake of the valuable mineral by the trees may be a useful indicator of gold deposits under the surface.

0072e31212ac,"1,000-year-old burials of 'first Christians' in Poland discovered near medieval settlement",,"Archaeologists have uncovered part of a cemetery, including 1,000-year-old human skeletons, near the remains of a fortified medieval settlement in the village of Borkowo in Poland. The finds date to a time when many people were converting from paganism to Christianity in Poland. ""We view these people as representatives of the 'first Christians' in these lands,"" Justyna Marchewka-Długońska , a researcher at Cardinal Stefan Wyszyński University in Warsaw and a member of the research team, told Live Science in an email. The archaeologists noted that even though people were converting from paganism to Christianity, they still placed grave goods in their burials — a practice that was more commonly done among pagans. The team found the remains of arrowheads, a battle ax, knife blades, rings and carnelian (a reddish semiprecious stone) beads with the bodies. Although some media outlets have claimed this discovery is a mass burial containing warriors who served Mieszko I — a duke of Poland who reigned from about 960 to 992, united the country and created an independent state — the researchers we spoke with said these claims are inaccurate. Instead, they said, the people were buried in single graves within a cemetery. While all of the burials seem to date to around the time of Mieszko I, it's not clear what connection, if any, these people had to him. ""Historically, we do not yet know whether we can discuss any connections at all,"" Marchewka-Długońska said. ""For now, the skeletons have been collected and are awaiting anthropological analysis,"" Marchewka-Długońska said.

To start with, it is not a good pick for sprinters or taller individuals. This treadmill is best suited for walking and light jogging, and that is because its speed is limited to 6.2 mph (10 km/h). It has a relatively short and narrow tread, making it somewhat uncomfortable to use for individuals with a long stride, and its maximum user weight stands at just 265 lbs (120 kg). However, you would be hard-pressed to find a better value in this price range. The Urevo Strol 2E outshines its competitors with a good quality build, a quiet, powerful motor, and connected apps, and now you can get this budget gem for just $206.99 . But hurry, Prime Day has already finished, so we don't expect this deal to last much longer.

2f1d9d3c23fd,"Science history: First two-way phone call across outdoor lines made by Alexander Graham Bell — Oct. 9, 1876",,"QUICK FACTS Milestone: The first two-way phone call across outdoor lines Date: Oct. 9, 1876 Where: Cambridgeport to Boston, Massachusetts Who: Alexander Graham Bell and Thomas Watson On the afternoon of Oct. 9, 1876, Alexander Graham Bell was in Boston when he had a three-hour chat with his assistant and fellow inventor, Thomas Watson. It would not have been noteworthy — except that Watson was across the Charles River, in Cambridgeport. This was the first two-way telephone call transmitted across outdoor wires, and it would eventually pave the way for a global network that would transform how people communicate. Bell and Watson had spoken via their device as early as March of that year, soon after Bell's improved ""telegraphy"" device was patented . But the crackly command — ""Mr. Watson, come here; I want to see you,"" was issued over only a short distance. In contrast, the call that October day lasted a few hours and was transmitted via long telegraph wires . Bell was in a crowded field of inventors who were dreaming up new ways to transmit sound via electricity. A few decades earlier, Antonio Meucci created — and took preliminary steps to patent — a ""telectrophone"" to communicate with his bedridden wife in another room. In 1861, German inventor Johann Philipp Reiss coined the term ""telephon"" to describe a device of his own, which converted sound waves to an electrical signal and back. His transmissions faithfully reproduced melodies , but words were too garbled to be understood. And around the same time as Bell, Elisha Gray developed a similar water-microphone-based design. Key to Bell's ability to transmit a voice was the notion of transmitting multiple frequencies simultaneously, which he did by using what he called an ""undulatory"" — or variable — current, rather than the pulses of intermittent current that Samuel Morse had used for his telegraph. Bell making the first telephone call between New York and Chicago, 16 years after he made a call from Boston to his assistant and fellow inventor John Watson, just across the river in Cambridgeport. (Image credit: Bettmann via Getty Images) ""The rate of oscillation in the electrical current corresponds to the rate of vibration of the inducing body — that is, to the pitch of the sound produced,"" Bell's patent states. ""The intensity of the current varies with the amplitude of the vibration — that is, with the loudness of the sound."" In short, the features of the current encode features of the sound. Get the world’s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox. Bell's first prototype used a diaphragm, an inductor (an iron core encircled by a coil of wires), a permanent magnet, and connecting wires. When a sound wave hit the diaphragm, the pressure waves caused that diaphragm to vibrate. These vibrations moved the inductor, altering the magnetic field it produced, which, in turn, caused current to flow in the coiled wire. That current was then transmitted via wires to the receiver, which had the same elements in reverse. That first long-distance conversation was galvanizing, but the first telephone line, which was laid in April 1877, only connected a merchant's shop with his home . Phone lines were initially rented in pairs and were used to connect discrete locations. But the opening of "" central exchanges "" and switchboards around a year later enabled calls to be routed between locations, dramatically improving the usefulness of the invention. It would be decades before the first transcontinental and cross-continental calls were made, and the first undersea trans-Atlantic phone cables were laid in 1956. The telephone industry helped spur a number of other modern innovations, including switches , the transistor that would usher in the computing era , fiber-optic cables for data transmission , and communications satellites .",https://www.livescience.com/technology/communications/science-history-first-two-way-phone-call-across-outdoor-lines-made-by-alexander-graham-bell-oct-9-1876,Science,BBC,,https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/w5rJTtgYezrFEmxsVGxaBU-1920-80.jpg,2025-10-09T06:00:00+00:00,63d2b1a20509bc6945409d4fa8004dd5c14dddf6
c9848da5bd1e,"Some naked mole rats are designated toilet cleaners, study suggests",,"Naked mole rats may have specific roles, including ""toilet cleaners"" and ""garbage collectors,"" new research suggests. The findings, published Wednesday (Oct. 8) in the journal Science Advances , hint that naked-mole-rat colonies are even more complex than scientists previously thought. ""Our findings reveal the distinct roles of breeders and the remarkable behavioral diversity among nonbreeders, underscoring the complexity of naked mole-rat social organization,"" Teruhiro Okuyama , a behavioral neuroscientist at the University of Tokyo, told Live Science. Naked mole-rats ( Heterocephalus glaber ) are small, almost-hairless rodents that live in underground colonies of between about 20 to several hundred individuals. They are one of just two mammal species known to be eusocial , meaning they show advanced social organization, similar to bees or wasps. For eusocial mammals, the queen reproduces, while most of the other members of the colony — which can stretch across several miles of tunnels — are sterile workers. These workers perform an array of jobs, including soldiers, tunnel diggers, foragers and caretakers. But it was unknown whether individuals switched jobs or tended to stick to specific roles. To investigate, Teruhiro Okuyama , a behavioral neuroscientist at the University of Tokyo, and his colleagues created an artificial burrow in their lab. It was made up of nine chambers, each 5.9 by 5.9 inches (15 by 15 centimeters), and arranged in a three-by-three grid. The adjacent boxes were connected by 6-inch-long (16 cm) pipes. The mole-rats designated different chambers for specific uses, including a nesting place, a garbage area, a communal ""toilet"" and several compartments without specific functions. Get the world’s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox. For 30 days, Okuyama and his colleagues studied five colonies, each of which contained about 20 individuals, by implanting microchips in the mole rats and installing detectors throughout the colony box. This allowed the researchers to continuously monitor where the animals went and which individuals they spent time with. Researchers attached microchips to the mole rat workers to monitor their movements within the colony. (Image credit: Evgeniya Moskova via Getty Images) They found that the breeding animals — the queen and a few males — stayed close to each other most of the time and followed each other around. But the workers, they discovered, could be divided into six groups based on their movements. ""They were doing different jobs if they weren't breeding,"" Okuyama told Live Science. One group moved a lot and spent the most time in the garbage chamber, so Okuyama speculated that they might be transport specialists. Another cluster mostly occupied the toilet chamber, so the researchers proposed that these individuals might be cleaners. A third group was less active and generally remained in the nest box. These were often younger animals, or individuals that were older and perhaps past their peak. ""I think the job is gradually changing just depending on the age,"" Okuyama said."" Complex colonies By revealing that there might be distinct roles for naked mole-rats apart from breeding or being a generic worker, the work underscores how much more complex their social organization might be than we thought, he added. ""It's a really interesting study,"" Chris Faulkes , an evolutionary ecologist at Queen Mary, University of London who wasn't involved in the work, told Live Science. ""Anyone who has spent time looking at naked mole rats would agree that there are loads of individual things going on and certain animals will be spending lots of time in the toilet chamber, sweeping up or digging. It's a good attempt to quantify these complexities further."" However, Markus Zöttl , a behavioral ecologist at Linnaeus University in Sweden who wasn't involved in the work, said it's hard to draw too many conclusions from the observations. ""This paper shows that there is variation in behavior between helpers. There are some helpers that are more active, some that are resting more,"" he told Live Science. ""But that's what you expect from any social animal. Some would be more proactive; others would be more socially aggressive; others are more timid. Some people might call this animal personality, and others would call it a caste system."" We should also be wary of jumping to conclusions about what happens in the wild based on a relatively small and simple lab burrow with short tunnels, Zöttl noted. ""If you think about the ecology of these species, a burrow can spread over the area of a football field,"" he said. Different behaviors could emerge in a complex, natural burrow system with long tunnels where animals need to dig to find enough roots to feed dozens or more colony members, rather than having food supplied, he said. While traveling through these long tunnels, the animals often establish their place in the social hierarchy by shoving, interacting or avoiding each other as they pass, Faulkes said, which would then influence their behavior within the colony. However, he still thinks the lab work gives us new insights. ""There is this hidden behavioral complexity, and you've got groups or individuals that do very different things and interact in different ways within the colony,"" he said.",https://www.livescience.com/animals/land-mammals/some-naked-mole-rats-are-designated-toilet-cleaners-study-suggests,Science,BBC,,https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XZFq5DzmaGCtZVqUB5WDWM-1920-80.jpg,2025-10-08T18:00:00+00:00,15278624e63837a8a5a5ef09acdca425bc5a0bbc
e78c46c9baac,"James Webb telescope finds 'remarkable' evidence that a black hole plowed through a galaxy, leaving an enormous scar behind",,"Astronomers have observed a gigantic cosmic ""contrail"" in a distant galaxy. The trail of gas and dust may have been churned out by a passing massive black hole , although there are other possible causes, scientists report in a new study. The contrail was spotted in the spiral galaxy NGC 3627, located roughly 31 million light-years from our solar system in the constellation Leo. Although contrails have been previously identified in the Milky Way , NGC 3627's is the most clearly defined contrail ever discovered and is ""remarkable for its sheer size,"" study co-author Mengke Zhao, a doctoral student in astronomy at Nanjing University in China , told Live Science in an email. The contrail is roughly 20,000 light-years long — about one-fifth the diameter of our entire galaxy — and extremely narrow, at only 650 light-years wide. Zhao and co-author Guang-Xing Li stumbled upon the galactic contrail when analyzing data collected by the Physics at High Angular Resolution of Nearby Galaxies (PHANGS) survey. Using a range of telescopes, including the James Webb Space Telescope ( JWST ) and the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) in Chile, this survey aims to study how gas and star formation influences, and is influenced by, galaxy structure and evolution. While the PHANGS-JWST data revealed that NGC 3627's contrail contains dust particles, the PHANGS-ALMA data suggested it was also rich in carbon monoxide. The contrail highlighted in the image is 6 kiloparsecs, or 20,000 light-years, long — one-fifth the width of the Milky Way galaxy. (Image credit: Zhao and Li 2025, arXiv ; CC BY-SA 4.0 ) The contrail is a faint, linear tail of gas and dust that appears distinct from the galaxy's two spiral arms. Based on a theoretical model Li co-developed in 2021, Zhao and Li think a massive compact object, like a black hole , was most likely responsible for creating it. The model suggests that as the object flew through the galactic disk, it squeezed out the gas, leaving behind the contrail marking its passage. The tremendous turbulence within NGC 3627's contrail supports this model. The contrail's features allowed the researchers to estimate that the compact object was about 10 million solar masses and was zipping past at a breakneck speed of 186 miles per second (300 kilometers per second) — 50% faster than the current speed record for a spacecraft, held by the Parker Solar Probe . Additional calculations indicate the contrail formed 20 million years ago, relatively recently in astronomical terms. (The Milky Way is more than 13 billion years old, for comparison). Although the researchers suggested the compact object could be an enormous black hole, they noted that it could also be the dense nucleus of a dwarf galaxy.

""The predicted mass fits both scenarios. A direct detection of the object itself is very challenging — if it's a faint dwarf galaxy, it would be too dim to see easily at NGC 3627's distance. Future deep optical surveys or very high-resolution ALMA observations might one day reveal a counterpart."" The researchers also suggested that mysterious red and compact objects known as "" little red dots "" may also be responsible, although they haven't worked out exactly how. Zhao and Li plan to continue studying the contrail and will search the PHANGS observations for more of these streams. ""Understanding their evolution and how common they are could tell us a lot about the population of massive dark objects flying through galactic disks,"" Zhao said. The study, which hasn't been peer-reviewed yet, is available as a preprint on the arXiv server. Editor's note: This article was updated at 11:00 a.m. ET on Oct. 9 to correct a typo.

2a218ba08153,We saw Saturn and Jupiter with this telescope and now it's even cheaper for Prime Day,,"With the planets returning to the evening sky over the winter, a telescope is the perfect way to get a closer look — great news for those of us who aren't nocturnal and don't want to wake up in the wee hours of the early morning to get a glimpse. Our optics writer impulse-bought the Celestron AstroMaster 130EQ during Prime Day last year, and it's discounted again this Prime Day, selling for $251 at Amazon , which is almost the cheapest we've seen it all year. Saturn has already made its return to the sky just after sunset, and Jupiter will be following suit over the next few months (it's currently visible after midnight). Plus, around February 28, 2026, you'll be able to see a six-planet lineup about an hour after sunset (Jupiter, Uranus, Saturn, Neptune, Venus, and Mercury). With the Celestron AstroMaster 130EQ, we have spent many nights (OK, evenings) out in our backyard gazing at Jupiter's four Galilean moons and Saturn's rings, and we think, for price versus performance, it's one of the best beginner telescopes out there. Image 1 of 1 We have found the setup gets quicker and easier every time you do it. (Image credit: Kimberley Lane) The Equatorial mount setup is a nice challenge for beginners to sink their teeth into (especially as the instructions leave a lot to be desired), but once you've figured it out, it becomes a lot easier to follow objects through the sky as opposed to an Alt-Azimuth mount, which you tend to see a lot more of with beginner models. It comes with two eyepieces — a 10mm and a 20mm — although we wish it had come with a barlow lens, like some of the other models do. Still, we'd recommend upgrading the eyepieces over time anyway, and this Celestron eyepiece and filter accessory kit is 26% off for Prime Day . Key features: Newtonian reflector, 130mm aperture, 650mm focal length, f/5 focal ratio, includes 10mm and 20mm eyepieces. Product launched: February 2007. Price history: Over the past year, we've only seen this particular model around $5 cheaper, so this really is one of the best prices you'll be able to buy it for. Price comparison: B&H: $339.99 | Walmart: $324.99 | Adorama: $329.99 Reviews consensus: An excellent telescope for beginners who want to kickstart their stargazing journey. You'll need to upgrade the eyepieces and some of the parts over time, but for the price, it gives enough of a challenge to newbies without being overwhelming and is better than many other 'beginner' models. Digital Camera World: ★★★ ½ Featured in guides: Best telescopes , Best beginner telescopes ✅ Buy it if: You want to start stargazing as a regular hobby, and want a good beginner telescope that you won't need to upgrade once you get bored. ❌ Don't buy it if: You want a super simple setup-and-go telescope — for that, we'd recommend an AZ mount.

6fdf8c54aef8,Scientists invent 'Pulse-Fi' prototype — a Wi-Fi heart rate monitor that's cheaper to set up than the best wearable devices,,"Engineers have used artificial intelligence (AI) and cheap, off-the-shelf hardware to convert the amplitude of Wi-Fi signals into estimates of a person's heart rate. The accuracy of this system, called Pulse-Fi, is remarkably consistent across body positions and distances, the researchers wrote in a study published Aug. 5 in the proceedings of the 2025 IEEE International Conference on Distributed Computing in Smart Systems and the Internet of Things (DCOSS-IoT) . The results show that reliable heart rate information can be extracted in a contact-free way using pre-existing Wi-Fi infrastructure and hardware, study authors Pranay Kocheta, Nayan Bhatia and Katia Obraczka told Live Science in a jointly written email. Obraczka is a professor of computer engineering at the University of California, Santa Cruz (UC Santa Cruz), Bhatia is a doctoral student in computer science at UC Santa Cruz and Kocheta is a high school student who conducted the research during an internship. Many at-home technologies, like chest-strap monitors and smartwatches , monitor vital signs, including heart rate and breathing rate. However, these devices require constant contact with the individual and are expensive, prompting the need for noncontact technologies. One such technology can harness the information in Wi-Fi signals, which are radio waves that carry data between an emitter and a receiver, such as between a router and a computer. The ""channel state information"" (CSI) provides the amplitude and phase of the signal as it journeys between these two devices, including when it passes through obstacles such as moving chests . Because the signals warp when passing these barriers, researchers can filter the CSI data to capture the vital signs. Various examples now exist for Wi-Fi heart rate detection , but Kocheta and his team argued that several limitations remain. For example, many rely on now-defunct hardware. To address these limitations, the researchers developed a new system called ""Pulse-Fi."" Get the world’s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox. Capturing vital signs To collect the data needed to evaluate Pulse-Fi, the team placed seven people — five male and two female — between two single-antenna ESP32 devices . These microcontroller devices released Wi-Fi signals, with one acting as an emitter and the other as a receiver. The participants' actual heart rate was collected at the same time via a pulse oximeter attached to their fingertip. Each individual participated three times: once at 3.3 feet (1 meter) from the EPS32s and then from 6.6 feet (2 m) and 9.8 feet (3 m) away. Each measurement window lasted five minutes. Nayan Bhatia demonstrates Pulse-Fi (Image credit: Erika Cardema/UC Santa Cruz) The team then developed a machine learning pipeline to estimate the heart rates from the CSI. The initial step was to extract the amplitude information, which relates to the individual heartbeats, and then remove the messy parts of the signal stemming from obstacles in the environment. Next, the engineers added a filter to remove signal frequencies outside the 0.8-to-2.17-hertz range, which corresponded to 48 to 130 beats per minute (BPM). Then, they added a second filter to smooth the signal further. The team then estimated the participants' heart rates using a long-term-short-term memory recurrent neural network , a form of machine learning that adds ""memory cells"" to the processing of sequential data, which provides the context needed to pick up dependencies in the data. In this instance, these dependencies relate to elements such as resting heart rate and exercise-induced spikes in BPM. The team was surprised to find the heart rate estimates remained accurate across the different distances from the ESP32 devices. Pulse-Fi under- and overestimated heart rates by an average of 0.429 BPM at 1 meter, 0.482 BPM at 2 m and 0.488 BPM at 3 m away. The researchers then used pre-existing Wi-Fi CSI health data to test how Pulse-Fi fared with different body positions and activities. The data came from 118 Brazilian adults holding 17 stationary and active positions, including sitting still, walking in place and sweeping the floor, for 60 seconds. The participants were 3.3 feet (1 m) from the Wi-Fi emitter and receiver as well as from the Raspberry Pi 3B+ used for collecting CSI data. They compared the neural network heart rate estimate against smartwatch readings and found that Pulse-Fi was unaffected by the person's body position. The typical error was 0.2 BPM. Wireless beats This early-stage technique is theoretically interesting, said Andreas Karwath , a health data scientist at the University of Birmingham in the U.K. who was not involved in the research. However, he said a key limitation of this research is that the same data were used for the training, validation and testing of the model. The researchers shuffled the data each time, but Karwath said this creates a self-fulfilling prophecy. ""It's like predicting someone's disease by learning from the person and then predicting the person,"" he told Live Science. ""That doesn't make sense."" In a response to this critique, the researchers said that while their analysis did involve shuffling, they have since tested the model in real time, where the Pulse-Fi was trained only on past data and then evaluated on a completely new input signal and environment. This research has not yet been published. Karwath also explained that the smartwatch and oximeter used to collect the heart rate information for the neural network to be compared against are not always 100% accurate, so their data may be biased. Kocheta, Bhatia and Obraczka acknowledged this limitation about the smartwatch. However, ""the pulse Oximeter is generally considered to be a certified medical device which is very accurate,"" they said. The team is now expanding the Pulse-Fi testing to track the heart rates of multiple individuals in a room at the same time to see how well the model copes with crowded environments. The authors said that no explicit personal information is involved in the data processing pipeline and all heart rate estimates remain in the hardware. As such, there are no data privacy concerns with the technology. Karwarth predicted that the technology is at least five to 10 years away from being deployable.",https://www.livescience.com/technology/communications/scientists-invent-pulse-fi-prototype-a-wi-fi-heart-rate-monitor-thats-cheaper-to-set-up-than-the-best-wearable-devices,Science,BBC,,https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XiDTtqE9McwuAZ89kCmjF9-2560-80.jpg,2025-10-08T12:14:48+00:00,fc1103a15c605c392d5004a2b4b774703eb62e3c

The competition saw 39 goals scored across nine matches during the opening round, and the new Swiss model format delivered on its promise to deliver unpredictability. The explosive start was highlighted by FC Barcelona's spectacular display of goalscoring, defeating Bayern Munich 7-1. It was a dominant showcase for Liga F sides in general, as Atletico Madrid handed St. Polten a lopsided 6-0 loss, and Real Madrid claimed a 6-2 victory over AS Roma. Current title holders Arsenal were handed a tough 2-1 loss by tournament giants OL Lyonnes, as Haitian international Melchie Dumornay scored a first-half brace for the French side. Opening day set the stage for a critical Matchday 2, where teams will look to either build on early momentum or recover from initial setbacks. For the first time, CBS Sports will be the exclusive U.S. home of the UWCL, with every minute of the action available across different platforms. That includes comprehensive coverage for Matchday 2, with the schedule split between Paramount+ , CBS Sports Network and CBS Sports Golazo Network . Here's what you need to know before tuning in. How to watch Paramount+ will be a one-stop shop for all things Champions League, while CBS Sports Network and CBS Sports Golazo Network will have select matches and additional coverage. Each day's broadcast begins with UEFA Women's Champions League Today on both Paramount+ and CBS Sports Golazo Network before the early kickoffs, while Paramount+ and CBS Sports Network will have an hour-long pre-match show before the later matches. Post-match coverage will air on Paramount+ and CBS Sports Network , while CBS Sports Golazo Network will have a new edition of Scoreline to close out the day's action. CBS Sports' new UEFA Women's Champions League Today studio show will be anchored by Hannah Cash, while Jen Beattie , Janelly Farias, Darian Jenkins , Kelley O'Hara , and Ali Riley will serve as analysts. Chris Wittyngham will handle play-by-play duties and will be paired with Beattie and Jenkins, while Anita Jones will report pitchside and Christina Unkel will serve as the rules analyst. The league phase comes to the UWCL The league phase will make its way to the Women's Champions League this season, the competition expanded from the 16 to 18 teams for the new format.

Arsenal will try to bounce back from a disappointing result against Lyon on day one when they go against Benfica. The Portugal side are known for strong home performances, and it'll be another test for the current title holders and their ability to bounce back. Another English side that need a response is Chelsea. The Blues were held to a 1-1 draw against Twente and will try to get their campaign on track at home against Paris FC, another side also looking for more points. Chelsea will have the backing of Stamford Bridge, but Paris FC will want a better showing as well after letting a two-goal lead slip last week. German squad Bayern Munich will want to make a statement against Juventus after a miserable showing against FC Barcelona. The Bundesliga side needs points and to chip away at goal differential after losing 7-1. It won't be easy against an eager Juventus side that's looking to build off early tournament success with their 2-1 win over Benfica. USWNT players to watch in the UWCL: Multiple USWNT players featured in the Champions League last week, and others who are still hopeful. Goalkeeper Phallon Tulis-Joyce had a massive performance with Manchester United. She's the squad's starting keeper and helped the team earn a clean sheet and its first win of the tournament. Alyssa Thompson is off to an impressive beginning with Chelsea, got the start last week against Twente, and another on Sunday during the Blues' win against Tottenham. She'll likely remain an option as head coach Sonia Bompastor manages minutes across the roster. Fullback Emily Fox is Arsenal's starting fullback, and they'll rely on her against Benfica, while Jenna Nighswonger has yet to be utilized by manager Renée Slegers in the tournament or in domestic competition. Additionally, Crystal Dunn has also not yet checked into matches for Paris Saint-Germain. Meanwhile, head coach Jonatan Giraldez has utilized all his American players for Lyon.

50eb3de094d3,"Haji Wright, Cristian Roldan ace USMNT auditions, offer optimism for USA soccer eight months before World Cup",,"COMMERCE CITY, Colo. – Eight months before the opening whistle blows at the World Cup, every friendly is essentially a live audition for all the world to see, and on Tuesday against Australia, U.S. men's national team head coach Mauricio Pochettino embraced the spirit of experimentation completely. He made six changes to the starting lineup from Friday's 1-1 draw with Ecuador and was forced to make a seventh when Christian Pulisic came off with an injury in the first half. It was a golden opportunity for those players despite the imperfect situation of playing without the team's star player, and the results were understandably mixed. Make no mistake, though – a few winners emerged from the USMNT's 2-1 win over Australia on Tuesday, offering new signs of optimism for the World Cup hosts in the process. The one indisputable winner in the Denver suburbs on Tuesday night was forward Haji Wright, who scored twice in his first start for the national team since Pochettino took the helm a year ago. His absence was not because he was out of favor but rather the unlucky result of injuries, though he returned to the national team in arguably the form of his – the versatile forward has nine goals in 11 games for Coventry City this season, hopes high that he would translate that form to the USMNT at a crucial time in the group's World Cup preparations. Wright did just that on Tuesday with two impressive goals, ones that showcase his unique instincts as a goalscorer. Wright was on the receiving end of an impressive ball from midfielder Cristian Roldan for his first and opted to almost run ahead of the ball, catching Australia's defense by surprise as he poked the ball into the back of the net. The second, in which Wright connected again with Roldan, saw Wright outrun an opposition player and then slip behind him for a perfect, unobstructed shot on goal. Wright's trajectory nearly matches that of Folarin Balogun 's, who himself spent nearly the entirety of Pochettino's first year in charge away with injury but has two goals and one assist in four games since returning in September. While Balogun may have had a chance to stake his claim first on a starting role, Wright's performance on Tuesday just might create a sense of competition that has been missing in that particular position for years – and exemplifies the competitive edge Pochettino has fostered within the expanded player pool , a year into the job. Balogun and Wright's recent contributions lend a real helping hand to the USMNT's overall attacking efforts, which have yet to fully click in the midst of Pochettino's ongoing rebuild of the side. Against Ecuador and in September's 2-0 win over Japan , the U.S. generated promising opportunities but were unable to finish them at times, while against Australia, their meaningful opportunities were almost few and far between as they faced another uber-defensive opponent. Balogun and Wright found ways to overcome those challenges even if there is room for improvement, while the assists from Malik Tillman on Balogun's goal against Ecuador and Roldan's pair for Wright against Australia signal that some things are, in fact, working. In October, the group also managed to find goals without Pulisic on the field for all but the 30-minute sliver of time he played on Tuesday, another sign that things just may be trending in the right direction. Roldan came out as another big winner on Tuesday, charting an unlikely journey back into the USMNT's good graces. Like Wright, he was a member of the U.S.' 2022 World Cup team but in the years since, the 30-year-old's national team profile faded until a surprise late call-up for September's friendlies against South Korea and Japan . He returned to the fold for a second international break in a row and has now played an important role in the USMNT's last two victories, bolstered by the fact that Pochettino's new-look tactical approach, rooted in building out of the back with three center backs, is exactly how Roldan is used to playing at the Seattle Sounders . Wright and Roldan provided a lot of upside for the USMNT against Australia, almost making up for the mistakes that the hosts' defense made at different points during the game. The entire group – this time made up of goalkeeper Matt Freese , center backs Chris Richards , Miles Robinson and Mark McKenzie and midfielder James Sands in front of them – were caught ball-watching on Jordan Bos' goal for Australia, and they were caught sleeping at the start of the second half. It will perhaps come as no surprise that the USMNT are better with Tyler Adams on the field, even if it is bad news for Sands, while it may be less encouraging that the U.S.'s best defensive performances so far have come when Tim Ream is on the field.

2825bfe4a87f,"Portland Fire coaching hire: WNBA expansion team to hire Alex Sarama from Cleveland Cavaliers, per report",,"The Portland Fire are expected to hire Alex Sarama as the first coach in franchise history, according to Annie Costabile of Front Office Sports . The Portland Supporter first reported Tuesday that the Fire had inadvertently announced Sarama's hiring on their LinkedIn page before it was swiftly deleted. Sarama is currently an assistant coach with the Cleveland Cavaliers, having previously served as the team's director of player development. Prior to joining the Cavs, Sarama was an assistant coach and director of player development for the Rip City Remix, the Portland Trail Blazers' G League affiliate. Sarama, who hails from England, also worked with Paris Basketball and the London Lions earlier in his career. Outside of his work with professional teams, Sarama founded Transforming Basketball in 2023 with a mission to ""transform the basketball world by helping individuals and organizations make sense of an evidence-based approach."" Sarama is a leading proponent of Constraints-Led Approach, or CLA, a method of training that is taking the sports world by storm . Here is a quick explanation of CLA, via The Athletic's Jared Weiss last month : ""The CLA takes the ground-up approach of block training, which eliminates the infinite variables that affect athletes in the heat of competition, and flips it on its head. ""That means putting players into scenarios with different limitations called ""constraints"" to simulate the unpredictable environment of an actual game. Whether it's the number of steps they can take, the area of the playing surface from which they are allowed to maneuver or even the weight of the ball they are using, players are repeatedly told to overcome restrictions to accomplish a task. While painstakingly working through mistakes, they are forced to find advantageous opportunities, ""affordances"" in CLA parlance."" With the Cavaliers, Sarama designed practices and individual development plans for players, and played a major role in the team's leap from 48 wins in 2024 to 64 wins in 2025 with largely the same roster. The Fire will hope that Sarama, or ""Professor Alex,"" as he came to be known with the Cavaliers, can have the same impact in Portland as their journey as a franchise begins. This is not the first time that the Fire have had a mishap with a major announcement. In June, a month before their branding was officially announced, trademark applications for the ""Portland Fire"" and related logos were published by Sean Highkin of The Rose Garden Report . The Fire were officially introduced as the WNBA's 15th team in September of 2024, and will begin play next season as part of the league's expansion push. The first incarnation of the Fire lasted from 2000-02 before the team folded due to financial issues. ""As a city that has long championed women's sports, Portland is ready to reclaim its place in the WNBA and reignite its connection to the game on the world stage,"" Clare Hamill, the team's interim president, said in July. ""We are thrilled to complete the journey of bringing professional women's basketball back to the Rose City, while honoring the legacy of the original franchise to blaze a new, bold path forward."" Prior to reportedly hiring Sarama, the Fire have been building out their front office. Inky Son, their first president, was suddenly fired in June, after just three months on the job. Hamill, a long-time Nike executive was hired as her replacement on an interim basis and remains in the role. In August, the team announced it had hired Vanja Černivec as their general manager. Černivec previously worked with the Golden State Valkyries as their vice president of basketball operations, and helped them have the best inaugural season by an expansion club in league history in 2025. On Tuesday, the Fire also announced the hiring of Ashley Battle as vice president of basketball operations, strategy and innovation. Battle played in the WNBA from 2005-2010 and most recently worked as a scout for the Boston Celtics and a television commentator for the Connecticut Sun. The next step for the Fire will be their expansion draft, but it's unclear when that will happen, or how it will work with the Toronto Tempo also entering the league next season. Expansion draft rules have to be collectively bargained, so the league cannot set a date until a new collective bargaining agreement is in place. If the expansion draft ends up being delayed due to the contentious labor battle between the WNBPA and the WNBA, that could actually benefit Hamill, Černivec and Sarama, who would have more time to prepare.",https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/news/portland-fire-coaching-hire-wnba-expansion-team-to-hire-alex-sarama-from-cleveland-cavaliers-per-report,Sport,BBC,,https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2025/10/15/0a9bad17-0b08-4842-bb98-11ba94caab5f/thumbnail/1200x675/28a38f30305ede6e311f29ca8940a73c/untitled-design-62.png,2025-10-15T02:13:18+00:00,fbba5b4f03a0c9c5e68f8a5c696ecad5a9a21e5a
a6e3c011b2db,"Alex Bregman to opt out of Red Sox deal, enter MLB free agency, per report",,"Getty Images Veteran infielder Alex Bregman will be opting out of his contract the Boston Red Sox and becoming a free agent this coming offseason, the New York Post reports. Bregman, 31, is coming off a highly productive 2025 season for Boston in which he slashed .273/.360/.462 (128 OPS+) with 18 home runs and 28 doubles. Although he was limited to 114 games played because of a serious quad strain, Bregman still managed a WAR of 3.5 for the season. He earned his third career All-Star selection. For his career, Bregman boasts an OPS+ of 132 and a WAR of 43.1 across parts of 10 MLB seasons. Last winter, Bregman turned down a higher offer from the Detroit Tigers in order to sign a shorter-term deal with the Red Sox. That deal paid him $36.67 million for 2025 and includes $41.67 million salaries for both 2026 and 2027 with opt-outs after each of those seasons. Since Bregman on a rate basis enjoyed his best offensive season since 2022, he and agent Scott Boras are betting he'll have a healthier market in the coming 2025-26 offseason. That upcoming free-agent class includes position players like Kyle Tucker , Pete Alonso , Bo Bichette , and Kyle Schwarber . However, at third base -- Bregman's primary position this past season -- only Eugenio Suárez stands out. Boston figures to make an effort to bring Bregman back for 2026 and beyond, and other teams possibly in need of help or upgrades at third base include the Tigers, Seattle Mariners , Toronto Blue Jays , New York Mets , Philadelphia Phillies , and Texas Rangers .",https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/news/alex-bregman-to-opt-out-of-red-sox-deal-enter-mlb-free-agency-per-report,Sport,BBC,,https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2025/10/15/4cc0976b-f3cb-4ffc-b77c-7e0aad5758af/thumbnail/1200x675/5b410f32682d94f3e7c1a4069731034d/alex-bregman-getty-3.png,2025-10-15T01:31:45+00:00,289424a886f51700852ccf996b8faa5338d378ab

We're up to five openings in the power conferences midway through the 2025 season --  and that doesn't count Stanford, where Frank Reich was named interim coach in March. Only five power jobs came open all of last season, when 30 total jobs (25 in the Group of 6) were filled.  Overall, the two years leading up to this cycle (2025-26) were the most hectic we've seen this century, with a total of 61 programs changing head coaches. That means an incredible 44.9% of FBS teams changed leadership during a two-year span. That number will skyrocket this fall and winter.  CBS Sports is tracking every move in the 2025-26 cycle and grading each hire below.       College football coaching carousel    TeamInOutAnalysisTroy TaylorStanford fired Taylor amid allegations of mistreating female staffers. Taylor posted a 6-18 record in two seasons with the program after coming to Palo Alto after a successful run at Sacramento State. He lost eight of last nine games. The Cardinal hired Frank Reich to serve as interim coach, which reunites him and Stanford general manager Andrew Luck; Reich coached Luck with the Indianapolis Colts for one season in 2018.DeShaun FosterUCLA Foster only three games into his second season. The former All-American running back with the Bruins fished his tenure with a 5-10 record, including 3-6 in Big Ten matchups.Brent PryPry's tenure at    Virginia Tech    came to an end following his team's 0-3 start. The decision came after the Hokies' 45-26 home loss to    Old Dominion   , which was the third straight by double digits. The Hokies were never ranked in the three-plus years of Pry's tenure as coach. Pry's predecessor, Justin Fuente, went 43-31 at Virginia Tech, but was fired after going 10-11 in his final two seasons at the helm.Mike GundyOklahoma State    outsted Gundy after he spent more than two decades at the helm of the Cowboys. The move ended a tenure that once positioned the program among the Big 12's elite. Gundy, 58, was the second-longest tenured FBS coach. He departed after a steep decline during the past two seasons, including a 3-9 record in 2024 and a 1-2 start to 2025.Trent BrayOregon State  fired Bray seven games into his winless second season leading the program. The Beavers dropped to 0-7 with Week 7's 39-14 loss to Wake Forest  , which marked their fourth double-digit defeat of the year. Bray's first year in his new post got off to a decent start. The Beavers went 4-1 through the first half of the 2024 regular season, with their only loss coming against Oregon, the eventual Big Ten champion. But Oregon State spiraled to 1-6 down the stretch, causing it to miss a bowl game.Sam PittmanArkansas ' decision came following a 56-13 loss to Notre Dame and a week after the Razorbacks squandered an 18-point lead on the road at   Memphis Situated on one of college football's hottest seats  entering his sixth season at the program, Pittman finishes 32-34 overall at Arkansas, including a 14-29 mark against SEC competition.

Trent DilferUAB moved on from Dilfer six games into his third season with the Blazers. UAB's decision came just one day after the team dropped to 2-4 on the year in a 53-33 loss to FAU. Dilfer was on track for a third straight losing season with the Blazers. All four of their losses this year came by at least 14 points and only one of their wins came against an FBS opponent.James FranklinPenn State fired Franklin six games into his 12th season with the Nittany Lions -- amid a disastrous three-game slide.

50923f613cf0,Dawn Staley is confident South Carolina 'won't skip a beat' despite Chloe Kitts' season-ending injury,,"South Carolina is entering the 2025-26 season as the national champion runner-up and the No. 2 team in the nation, but the Gamecocks are having to adjust after losing star forward Chloe Kitts to a torn ACL . Although it is a significant loss, coach Dawn Staley said the team still feels confident moving forward without her. ""It's not like we're going to ask someone to be Chloe because that's impossible,"" Staley said at the SEC media day on Tuesday. ""But we're unafraid to go into the season without Chloe. We're not going to skip a beat. Our players know that anytime we sustain any kind of injury, we believe in the system that we put together. We believe in the players we've assembled. ""...We'll figure out a way and we'll make adjustments. I'm somewhat glad it happened at this time when you don't have to make adjustments midseason. You go with who is healthy to go."" Kitts has been a key part of South Carolina's back-to-back championship appearances. She started 38 games last year while averaging 10.2 points and a team-best 7.7 rebounds per game. Her veteran leadership will still be valuable from the sideline, but her teammates roles will have to change without her on the court. Florida State transfer Ta'Niya Latson has been the most talked-about addition to the roster since she led the nation in scoring last year. However, former Mississippi State center Madina Okot will also play an important role in the frontcourt with Kitts out and forward Ashlyn Watkins taking this season off to work on her personal life. Last season with the Bulldogs, Okot averaged 11.3 points, 9.6 rebounds, 1.4 steals and 1.1 blocks in the 34 games she started. Meanwhile, forward Joyce Edwards had a strong freshman season coming off the bench. She led the Gamecocks in scoring with 12.7 points per contest and was the third most consistent rebounder behind Kitts and Watkins. ""Joyce is probably going to take the brunt of it because she just has more playing experience under us, but the same conversations I'm having with Joyce, with or without Chloe, I'm having,"" Staley said. Staley's rosters typically have depth and don't rely on one particular player. In this particular area, the coach pointed out that sophomore Adhel Tac is ""much improved"" and senior Maryam Dauda is playing ""extremely well."" ""I just really need them to be themselves,"" Staley said of her players. The Gamecocks will tip off their 2025-26 season on Nov. 3 against Grand Canyon.",https://www.cbssports.com/womens-college-basketball/news/dawn-staley-is-confident-south-carolina-wont-skip-a-beat-despite-chloe-kitts-season-ending-injury,Sport,BBC,,https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2025/10/15/8f846a3a-7de0-4361-80f4-150d7e32e747/thumbnail/1200x675/18de21fbd447808c47561ee639c9dcee/untitled-design-61.png,2025-10-15T00:46:43+00:00,d562fe7c68ff5c5d713ce14de231cd511b63375d

We've already seen one eastern Pennsylvania team fire a successful head coach (Penn State, James Franklin), and while I don't think Nick Sirianni's job is in imminent danger considering he most recently won the Super Bowl, a third straight loss will turn up the heat a bit.

331ca49625ed,"Al Horford explains why he left Celtics for Warriors, role Jayson Tatum's injury played in the decision",,"Al Horford stood in limbo for the majority of the NBA offseason as an unrestricted free agent. In the end, the longtime Boston Celtics standout made a difficult decision to sign elsewhere. He agreed in late September to a two-year deal with the Golden State Warriors , ending his second stint in Boston, where he won the first championship of his career. The decision was twofold, said Horford, who indicated that he and the Celtics had different priorities for the 2025-26 season. This late in Horford's career, opportunities to add another championship ring are dwindling. He already reached the mountaintop with the Celtics, but with Jayson Tatum set to miss at least the majority, if not all, of the upcoming campaign with a torn Achilles tendon, Horford's best chance of winning another title may not be in Boston. Warriors vs. Lakers: Stephen Curry's synergy with Al Horford immediately on display in preseason opener Brad Botkin ""There was two things there,"" Horford, 39, said to The Athletic . ""I think the financial part was a component, but more than that, it was the winning part of it, trying to contend for a championship. And I think there was a lot of things up in the air -- and it just felt like they weren't in that same vision, obviously, because JT getting hurt, that takes a big toll. Up until then I was staying in Boston the whole time."" The Celtics were in a tricky spot financially this offseason because of the second apron. They traded Kristaps Porziņġis and Jrue Holiday in salary-shedding moves and watched as key reserve Luke Kornet walked in free agency. The talent exodus was in many ways a necessity. Because of those departures and Tatum's potential to miss the entire season, the Celtics project to take a step backward from their perennial spot in the Eastern Conference's upper echelon. ""I think once that offseason happened and it started to progress, it became clear to me the team had different priorities,"" Horford said. ""Obviously, getting rid of Jrue, getting rid of Kristaps. And I know it's all salary stuff, but it was like a domino effect, and it was tough for me."" Horford's exit is another blow to the Celtics, whose frontcourt became thinner with each departure. He left a legacy across two stints with the franchise as an integral part of the 2024 championship run and one of the NBA 's top defenders on an annual basis. He remained highly prominent in the Celtics' lineup even at age 38. Golden State is, on paper, a terrific landing spot for Horford. He was everything the Celtics needed him to be, and he should fit just as well with the Warriors because of his defensive versatility and ability to step outside the 3-point line on the other end of the floor.",https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/al-horford-explains-why-he-left-celtics-for-warriors-role-jayson-tatums-injury-played-in-the-decision,Sport,BBC,,https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2025/10/14/8dc89be3-4c94-4971-90de-8c92cf497ee2/thumbnail/1200x675/48e2aba6f1f4762a59f0756a9c649fb8/adobe-express-file-19.jpg,2025-10-15T00:06:47+00:00,b64e293f16e7302876a7142e99d98c47621c6fc2
1da6013a2cc5,"Mavericks, Jason Kidd agree to multi-year contract extension ahead of coach's fifth season in Dallas",,"The Dallas Mavericks and coach Jason Kidd have agreed to a multi-year contract extension, the team announced Tuesday. The agreement comes just over a week before the team's season opener against the San Antonio Spurs . Terms of the deal were not disclosed. Kidd, 52, served as Mavericks coach for the last four seasons and posted a 179-149 record over that span. That includes a trip to the 2024 NBA Finals, where Dallas lost to the Boston Celtics in five games. Prior to his time in Dallas, he spent two seasons as a Lakers assistant after three-plus seasons with the Milwaukee Bucks , where he went 139-152. He got his coaching start in 2013-14 with the Brooklyn Nets , where he went 44-38 in one season before being traded to Milwaukee. Kidd became the subject of several coaching search conversations over the past few years, and the Mavericks denied the New York Knicks a chance to interview him for their vacancy earlier this offseason. NBA coach rankings: All 30 coaches split into eight tiers as 2025-26 season begins Sam Quinn A Hall of Fame inductee as a player in 2018, Kidd faces a big season with the Mavericks. Dallas stunningly dealt away Luka Doncić to the Los Angeles Lakers in early February 2025, receiving Anthony Davis , among others, in return. The trade was widely panned , and things went from bad to worse in Dallas when Davis was injured in his team debut and Kyrie Irving later tore his ACL. The injury-ravaged Mavericks finished 39-43 and got into the Play-In Tournament, where they beat the Sacramento Kings but lost to the Memphis Grizzlies with a playoff berth on the line. Then the Mavericks' fortunes miraculously reversed when they won the NBA Draft lottery despite having just a 1.8% chance to do so. That allowed Dallas to select Cooper Flagg , the consensus player of the year at Duke last season who has already impressed in the preseason. With Flagg in the fold alongside Davis, Dereck Lively II and Daniel Gafford , the Mavericks figure to have a fearsome frontcourt defense, with Klay Thompson and Max Christie among key wings returning. Free agent signee D'Angelo Russell will be the team's lead ballhandler until Irving returns, if Irving returns at all this season. Dallas is slightly favored to miss the playoffs (-138) at FanDuel Sportsbook , though if things go well health-wise and Flagg can make an immediate impact, the team will likely field one of the NBA 's best defenses and contend for the postseason.",https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/mavericks-jason-kidd-agree-to-multi-year-contract-extension-ahead-of-coachs-fifth-season-in-dallas,Sport,BBC,,https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2025/10/14/154b99a5-7dd9-4e7b-931e-11deed1537d3/thumbnail/1200x675/91dbebbd4d266e51b56b41deec25c5b1/usatsi-27315171.jpg,2025-10-14T23:42:00+00:00,1a4dc82bdd2b9f576de889996d7deb44097ee1d0
10108c624e4c,"ACC predicted order of finish: Duke picked to win, UNC overrated, NC State underrated in preseason poll",,"The ACC released its preseason predicted order of finish on Tuesday ahead of the 2025-26 college basketball season.Duke was picked to win the conference in the annual preseason poll, while NC State forward Darrion Williams was given conference preseason Player of the Year honors. Williams transferred from Texas Tech to NC State to play for first-year coach Will Wade this offseason. After reaching the Final Four for the first time in the Jon Scheyer era, Duke will look to get back to college basketball's biggest stage with a handful of key newcomers on the roster. One of those players is former five-star forward Cameron Boozer -- the son of former NBA great and Duke player Carlos Boozer -- who is in contention to be the No. 1 overall pick in the 2026 NBA Draft . AP Top 25 poll reactions: North Carolina overrated, Kansas underrated in preseason college basketball rankings Cameron Salerno Rounding out the top five of the ACC standings behind Duke are Louisville , North Carolina , NC State and Virginia . Two of those teams will have first-year coaches in Wade (at NC State) and Ryan Odom (at Virginia). Odom was hired this offseason to replace former coach Tony Bennett, who retired just weeks before Virginia's season-opener last fall. Here is the full poll, followed by overrated and underrated observations from the predicted order of finish. ACC preseason predicted order of finish Overrated: North Carolina Predicted finish: 3 I wrote about North Carolina earlier this week and why they were labeled ""overrated"" in our annual preseason AP Top 25 poll overview. The Tar Heels were preseason ranked No. 25 in that poll, and I explained why NC State should've gotten the nod at the final spot, so it's only right to double down because UNC was picked ahead of NC State in this poll, too. This season is going to be a make-or-break year for UNC coach Hubert Davis. After getting into the NCAA Tournament as one of the final four teams in the field, UNC will have to be better this season to avoid sweating on Selection Sunday. UNC's resume included just one win over a ranked opponent and the Tar Heels went 0-3 against Duke. I do like North Carolina's frontcourt of Caleb Wilson and Arizona transfer Henri Veesaar . Alabama transfer Jarin Stevenson is also someone who could contribute to winning. I still think UNC is an NCAA Tournament team, but the Tar Heels are going to have to show up in marquee nonconference games against Kentucky , Kansas and Michigan State this season. Betting odds to win conference +700 Underrated: NC State Predicted finish: 4 The hype around NC State is real. Less than two years removed from a miraculous run to the Final Four under former coach Kevin Keatts, Wade has assembled a roster that can compete for the ACC crown right away. The obvious headliner from NC State's portal class is Williams, who played a huge role in Texas Tech reaching the Elite Eight this past spring. Williams is a bulldozer down low and is a matchup nightmare for smaller defenders. He can raise the floor and ceiling of this group. Tre Holloman (Michigan State), Terrance Arceneaux (Kentucky) and Ven-Allen Lubin (North Carolina) are three more names I'm keeping an eye on. I wouldn't be shocked if NC State finishes in the top three of the ACC standings. Betting odds to win conference +700 Overrated: Virginia Predicted finish: 5 Last season was chaotic for Virginia, as the program finished ninth in the ACC with an 8-12 conference record. The Cavaliers went out and hired Odom away from his post at VCU to bring life back into the program. The hire was good in a nutshell, but I have questions about the roster that make me think Virginia could finish below fifth in the final conference standings. I also like some of the teams behind Virginia, such as SMU, Clemson, Miami and Syracuse (more on them shortly). The name I'm keeping an eye on this season is San Francisco transfer Malik Thomas , who averaged nearly 20 points per game last season. If he can bring scoring to a team that finished No. 346 among all Division I teams in scoring offense, Virginia could outperform its preseason ranking. Betting odds to win conference +2200 Underrated: Syracuse Predicted finish: 9 Similar to Davis at North Carolina, this is also a make-or-break season for coach Adrian Autry at Syracuse. The program finished 14-19 last season (7-13 in ACC play) and missed the NCAA Tournament for the fourth consecutive season. Syracuse is my sleeper team in the ACC this year. J.J. Starling returns and the program also added a pair of top-35 recruits from the 2025 cycle in Sadiq White Jr . and Kiyan Anthony , who is the son of former Syracuse great and NBA legend Carmelo Anthony. Outside of the top four or five teams, the ACC is wide open. Look for Syracuse to finish in the top half of the ACC standings.

Preseason All-ACC First Team Second Team Underrated: Isaiah Evans, G/F, Duke Out of all the returners in the ACC, there's not a player that has a chance to improve his draft stock more than Evans. The former blue-chip recruit primarily came off the bench during his freshman season and despite receiving some draft buzz, decided to return to school for his sophomore season. Evans has been compared to former Duke player and current member of the Toronto Raptors, Brandon Ingram. Evans shot 41.6% from the 3-point line last season in 13.7 minutes per game. He has a chance to solidify himself as Duke's second-best player behind Boozer. If he does that, he will be in the running to earn first-team ACC honors. Overrated: Ryan Conwell, G, Louisville It's never easy to single out any player on these lists, but if I had to choose one, it would be Conwell. Part of that reasoning is how much of a step forward I think Evans will take at Duke this season. The other factor is that Louisville is loaded with talent. I firmly believe that Mikel Brown Jr. -- whether it's from Day 1 or in March -- will be the Cardinals' best player. Conwell was one of several key newcomers on Louisville's roster. He had a fantastic season at Xavier and posted similar scoring numbers during his 2023-24 season at Indiana State . Conwell is a volume 3-point shooter who will help tremendously. Part of my reasoning is that there will be a lot of mouths to feed, which could open the door for someone like Evans to land on the first team over Conwell.",https://www.cbssports.com/college-basketball/news/acc-predicted-order-of-finish-duke-picked-to-win-unc-overrated-nc-state-underrated-in-preseason-poll,Sport,BBC,,https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2025/10/14/02471218-e6a8-41cc-908e-ec6e14b00fcd/thumbnail/1200x675/34e41d793eaae2c7c9ab4e6005b2166d/usatsi-25321213-1.jpg,2025-10-14T22:51:49+00:00,1f918e7ac3e395033926e1775934e5882d2a814d

19323f13c98f,South Carolina's Dawn Staley doesn't foresee a female NBA head coach in her lifetime: 'I hope I'm wrong',,"South Carolina women's basketball coach Dawn Staley has interviewed for head coaching jobs in the NBA , most recently with the New York Knicks . However, she doesn't believe the league is getting a female head coach anytime soon. ""If I'm the Knicks coach and you have a five-game losing streak, it's not going to be about the losing streak,"" Staley said during Tuesday's SEC media day. ""It's going to be about being a female coach. So you as an organization, a franchise, you have to be prepared for and strong enough to ignore those types of instances when you're going to look to hire a female coach."" Staley said she took the interview with the Knicks because she has known team president Leon Rose for decades. The team ultimately hired Mike Brown, who was most recently the coach of the Sacramento Kings from 2022-25 and ended that tenure with a 107-88 overall record. Staley also interviewed for the Portland Trail Blazers in 2021. Ultimately, not getting an NBA job was not a big loss for Staley, whose Gamecocks have won two of the last four national championships. Women's college basketball AP Top 25: UConn takes No. 1 spot in preseason poll ahead of South Carolina Isabel Gonzalez The NBA job interviews were serious, but Staley admitted she might not really have it in her to be that kind of trailblazer. She was also asked if she thinks there will be a female head coach in the NBA during her lifetime, and she wasn't feeling too confident about it. ""No, I don't,"" Staley said. ""And I hope I'm wrong."" That being said, she would be happy to help any woman who wants to try. ""If there is somebody that is interested in knowing and interested in being the first female NBA coach, I've got all the information,"" Staley said. ""Come see me, because I'll get you prepared for the interview.

9f7d4bcaf24a,NHL power ratings: Avalanche lead the pack after Week 1 of 2025-26 season,"nhl rankings, nhl power ratings, nhl best teams, nhl best bets, nhl predictions, nhl power rankings, nhl ratings","With one week of the 2025-26 NHL season in the books, a total of eight teams have yet to suffer a regulation loss. However, only three of those clubs played more than two games, and one of them was in action four times. That team is the Colorado Avalanche . Colorado, which has eclipsed the 100-point mark in each of the past four seasons, won three of its first four contests, and its lone blemish was a shootout loss to the Dallas Stars . The Avalanche entered Week 2 with an NHL-high seven points, one more than the two-time reigning Stanley Cup champion Florida Panthers and Boston Bruins . Each week during the season, I'll rank the league's top 10 teams based on both the previous week's performances and their overall bodies of work in 2025-26. I'll also give brief synopsis for each club that explains why they're ranked where they are. Let's dive into the power ratings for Week 1 of the 2025-26 NHL season and highlight a few more teams of note. NHL Week 1 power ratings 1. Colorado Avalanche (3-0-1) The Avalanche allowed just one goal in their victories over the Los Angeles Kings , Utah Mammoth and Buffalo Sabres , and Scott Wedgewood posted a 1.72 goals-against average while playing in all four of the team's games. Offensively, 2024 Hart Trophy winner Nathan MacKinnon has gotten off to a fast start as he is tied for second in the NHL with four goals and shares the league lead in points (eight) with teammate Martin Necas . Both have recorded three multi-point performances, while Cale Makar tops all NHL defensemen with five points. 2. Florida Panthers (3-1-0) The Panthers opened the season with three consecutive victories, defeating the Chicago Blackhawks , Philadelphia Flyers and Ottawa Senators . The most impressive thing about their start was the fact they did it without Matthew Tkachuk , who likely will be sidelined until December following groin surgery, and captain Aleksander Barkov , who figures to miss the entire campaign after undergoing knee surgery. Florida's winning streak ended with Monday's 5-2 loss at Philadelphia, although the club rallied from a 2-0 deficit to forge a tie before allowing the go-ahead goal with less than five minutes remaining in the third period. Brad Marchand and Anton Lundell share the team lead with four points apiece, and both have landed on the scoresheet in each of the Panthers' last three games. 3. Boston Bruins (3-1-0) The Bruins also won their first three contests of 2025-26 before dropping a 4-3 decision to the Tampa Bay Lightning on Monday. Boston is tied with Colorado, Florida and the Minnesota Wild for the most goals in the NHL with 13, while David Pastrnak and Pavel Zacha both have registered a tally and four assists to top the club with five points. The Bruins likely won't keep up their scoring pace due to a lack of depth, but it's nice to see them start strong after having missed the playoffs last season for the first time since 2016. The Predators went on a spending spree last offseason and the return was dismal as they finished 30th in the league, failing to qualify for the postseason for the second time in three campaigns. They began 2024-25 with a five-game losing streak and never were able to get to .500, so seeing them start this season with two wins and an overtime loss to Utah is encouraging. Two-time All-Star Juuse Saros posted a 1.64 GAA as Nashville allowed only five goals over its first three games, while Filip Forsberg and Erik Haula -- who is on his second tour of duty with the club -- recorded a point in each contest. 5. Dallas Stars (2-0-0) The Stars gave up four goals in both of their games thus far but came away unscathed, edging the 2024-25 Presidents' Trophy-winning Winnipeg Jets in regulation and Colorado in a shootout. Mikko Rantanen and defenseman Thomas Harley lead the team with four points apiece, while Jason Robertson and Wyatt Johnston both have scored twice. Meanwhile, blue-liner Nils Lundkvist already has three points after registering only five in 39 games last season. The Hurricanes are just two games into 2025-26 and have three players with multiple goals. One is Seth Jarvis , who tallied twice in the team's season-opening 6-3 triumph over the New Jersey Devils and scored the overtime winner against the Flyers. Defenseman K'Andre Miller also tallied twice versus New Jersey in his debut with Carolina and Taylor Hall converted in both of the team's contests. After finishing next-to-last in the Pacific Division last season, the Kraken have won their first two games for the first time in the franchise's brief five-season history. They were strong defensively in those contests, allowing just one goal in victories over the Anaheim Ducks and Vegas Golden Knights . Jared McCann , who was Seattle's goal-scoring leader in each of its first three seasons, scored in both games, netting the winner against Vegas four seconds before overtime was set to conclude. Yes, the Red Wings opened 2025-26 with a 5-1 loss to the Montreal Canadiens . But they bounced back by sweeping a home-and-home series with the Toronto Maple Leafs , who won three of the four meetings between the Atlantic Division rivals last season. Detroit produced nine goals in the wins, with eight different players lighting the lamp. Lucas Raymond tallied twice in Saturday's 6-3 home triumph, while Mason Appleton scored with 45 seconds remaining in the third period at Toronto on Monday to give the Red Wings a 3-2 victory. Captain Dylan Larkin , who shares the team lead in goals with Raymond, notched a point in each of Detroit's first three contests. 9. Minnesota Wild (2-1-0) The Wild are tied for the NHL lead in goals thanks to their power play, which was outstanding during the first week of the season. Minnesota went 8-for-17 with the man advantage over its first three games for a ridiculous conversion rate of 47.1% and cashed in seven times on 14 opportunities over its last two contests. Kirill Kaprizov recorded three power-play goals and is tied with teammate Matt Boldy and Jack Eichel of the Golden Knights for third in the NHL with seven points. The 28-year-old Kaprizov is one man-advantage tally away from matching the total he registered in 41 games last season. 10. Winnipeg Jets (2-1-0) Winnipeg's top two offensive players in 2024-25 picked up where they left off, landing on the scoresheet in each of the team's first three games this campaign. Kyle Connor , who set a career high with 97 points last season, recorded his seventh hat trick in the NHL in the Jets' season-opening 5-4 loss to Dallas and notched one assist in victories over Los Angeles and the New York Islanders . Mark Scheifele set up each of Connor's goals against the Stars, netted a pair of tallies -- including the winner -- in a 3-2 triumph over the Kings and added an empty-netter in  Monday's 5-2 win versus the Islanders. Morgan Barron (two goals, two assists) also figured in the scoring in each of Winnipeg's contests and is on pace to obliterate the career high of 21 points he set in 2022-23.",https://www.cbssports.com/nhl/news/nhl-power-ratings-avalanche-lead-the-pack-after-week-1-of-2025-26-season,Sport,BBC,,https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2025/10/08/e9a813b7-5461-4322-ad9c-0af9d9cd57c6/thumbnail/1200x675/94a56bd6ee2641a68e70c5000bcc97a1/avalanche.jpg,2025-10-14T21:54:51+00:00,0796fa0cac48f5c1285316e33afa39b928ebc04a
cfaee31a61a2,"Fantasy Football Week 7 Tight End Preview: Projections, numbers to know, and more",,"Jay Biggerstaff We come to this point almost every year. I swore I wouldn't say it again, but yes, tight end looks deep in Fantasy Football . We actually have 12 tight ends in Week 7 projected to score double digit PPR Fantasy points, even with Dalton Kincaid on bye and Brock Bowers injured. Part of that is because we are projecting George Kittle to return from injured reserve, and he instantly moves back into the top five at the position. Part of it is because we project David Njoku to miss Week 7, which should mean a target share north of 20% for Harold Fannin Jr . against a Dolphins defense that is giving up 14.8 PPR FPPG to tight ends. And part of it is because both Chris Godwin and Emeka Egbuka are projected to be out, which means Cade Otton could be Baker Mayfield's number two target in a shootout with the Lions . But, a word of caution. Every time we have made this mistake, of thinking tight end was deeper than ever, the position has turned back into what it always is. And if there is one guy that could spearhead that happening again it is Travis Kelce . Kelce has had a bit of a resurgence at the start of 2025. His yards per reception (11.5) and yards per target (8.7) are both the best he's posted since 2022. But Rashee Rice is back. In the last 11 regular season games that Rice and Kelce have played at least half the snaps, Kelce has averaged 9.1 PPR FPPG. We are still ranking him as a starter this week, he's facing the Raiders and Rice hasn't played a real football game in more than a year. But if Kelce's targets disappear in Week 7 he will disappear from our weekly top 12. Here's everything else you need to know about tight end in Week 7: Week 7 TE Preview TE Preview Numbers to Know 47 -- Travis Kelce's 47 yards in Week 1 are the most the Chargers have allowed to a tight end this year. They face Tyler Warren in Week 7. 21% -- Jake Ferguson had a 21% target share in the first two weeks with CeeDee Lamb . He is still a must-start tight end in a shootout with the Commanders . 5 -- Tucker Kraft only has one game with more than five targets this year. It feels impossible to sit him because of his upside, but his floor is non-existent. 30.4% -- Michael Mayer led the Raiders with a 30.4% target share in his first game without Brock Bowers. He is a start until Bowers gets back. 21.1% -- Dallas Goedert has a 21.1% target share over the last month. It doesn't seem sustainable, but he is a start until that changes. 10 -- Trey McBride leads all tight ends with 10 red zone targets. He has already matched last year's two receiving touchdowns and looks well on his way to setting a career high in scores. 8 -- Oronde Gadsden had a career-high eight targets in Week 6. We'd like to see one more week before we start him, but he's a stash for sure.

9b7e1b5836ce,"Arkansas' John Calipari says he would retire before becoming 'transactional' in NIL, transfer portal era",,"This season marks 34 years on the college basketball sidelines for Arkansas coach John Calipari. With other old-guard coaches backing out of the sport by the year, those unable or unwilling to fully embrace the NIL and revenue-sharing era could soon be extinct. And Calipari made it clear at SEC Media Days Tuesday that he is part of that contingent. Imminent retirement may not be on the table for the three-time National Coach of the Year, but if his methodology proves untenable, he said that is when he would call it a career. ""I want to help 25 to 30 more families,"" Calipari said. ""The only way you do that is you're transformational as a coach. You're not transactional. If I become transactional -- I'm going to pay you this to do this and that -- then I won't do this anymore. I don't need to."" College basketball rankings: Each AP Top 25 team's strengths, weaknesses and depth chart entering 2025-26 Isaac Trotter Calipari's final years at Kentucky came with a clear ceiling, and many attributed the early-round NCAA Tournament exits to his staunch commitment to an outdated model. Calipari was as successful as they came when recruiting one-and-done elite high school prospects was a surefire method to reach the Final Four. But as the transfer portal led teams to stock up on veteran standouts and resulted in experienced teams winning championships, Calipari fell behind. ""I think all of those said I've done what I do, and I'm not willing to do 'all this' to stay in the profession,"" said Calipari. ""If you watched us in practice, you would say, 'He's still connected.' I'll know before anybody else that it's transactional now. That's why if someone put their name in the portal, I said, 'You're not coming back,' because it's not going to be transactional. If this is what you want, let's go, let's work together."" Most first-year coaches load up on transfer talent to construct their debut rosters. Despite inheriting an empty locker room at Arkansas, Calipari took just two transfers from programs not named Kentucky. High school recruits, and those who followed him from his old school, made up his Sweet 16 squad. One of the ""transactional"" elements of college basketball with which Calipari says he disagrees is the constant transferring from program to program in search of paydays. Players who seek to use every last ounce of their eligibility to capitalize on their earnings potential also do not fit into the Calipari model. The second-year Razorbacks coach wants to reform those realities at a sport-wide level. ""Part of the reason I'm still doing this, my son is in coaching,"" said Calipari. ""We've gotta fix some of this stuff before we're out for our own children. Right now, the things we're dealing with, we want to put it to other people, but the thing is filtered down to the coach and coaches. … ""Why would kids want to stay in school five extra years? For money. Well, we've gotta say 'You've got five years to play four, and that's it. That's all.' If we get those two things in order, we're on the path to being better.""",https://www.cbssports.com/college-basketball/news/arkansas-john-calipari-says-he-would-retire-before-becoming-transactional-in-nil-transfer-portal-era,Sport,BBC,,https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2025/10/14/b725de13-2c64-410f-a1ce-7dadb41c77cd/thumbnail/1200x675/c52344f4a0d8f7a05e40c0f0e2245381/gettyimages-2204931028-1.jpg,2025-10-14T21:51:54+00:00,de8f2620b6d9fdcddd49218dad03f707f912d766

0a7972a08013,The Conversation: Have the Hornets quietly put a nice core together?,,"What if this is the year that LaMelo Ball stays healthy? As bad as the Charlotte Hornets ' 2024-25 season was, they had a positive point differential in the 466 minutes he played with Brandon Miller and the 879 minutes he played with Miles Bridges . Ball is a wildly divisive player, but his vision and his touch are undeniable. This is his sixth season in Charlotte, and he showed long ago that he can lead an efficient offense. In the East, as long as the defense isn't dreadful, that might be enough to get into the play-in, especially if young wings Miller (the No. 2 pick in 2023) and Kon Knueppel (the No. 4 pick this year) produce at a high level. About that defense, though: The team's two best defenders -- Josh Green and Grant Williams -- will be sidelined at the beginning of the season, and, when Ball was on the court last season, the Hornets' halfcourt defense allowed 104.1 points per 100 possessions, which basically means it was hopeless. (As a point of reference, Phoenix gave up a league-worst 102.5 per 100 in the halfcourt.) Charlotte is alarmingly thin at center, with Moussa Diabaté, Mason Plumlee and rookie Ryan Kalkbrenner competing for minutes, and it's flush with offense-first guards, having added Collin Sexton and Spencer Dinwiddie to a roster that already included Ball, Tre Mann and summer league standout K.J. Simpson. You can envision a world in which the Hornets are buyers at the deadline, having shown the front office that it's worth adding reinforcements. You can also, however, envision them going the other way. The State of Play Last year: Ball led all Eastern Conference guards in All-Star fan voting, but didn't make the cut because the players had him third, the media had him seventh and the coaches didn't vote him in as a reserve. After an insane late-November stretch that included a 50-point game in Milwaukee and a 44-point game against Orlando two days later, Ball was sidelined with a strained calf. Later he dealt with ankle and wrist injuries, so he ended up playing only 47 games. That was 20 more than Miller managed, as his season ended when he had wrist surgery in January. The Hornets were 8-28 when they traded center Nick Richards to the Suns in the middle of that month, and they were 12-36 when they tried to trade center Mark Williams to the Lakers at the trade deadline in February. That deal was controversially rescinded , so Mark Williams returned to a center rotation that featured Diabaté and Jusuf Nurkić, the latter of whom was acquired on deadline day from Phoenix along with a first-round pick in exchange for Cody Martin and Vasilije Micić. Charlotte finished 19-63, with the league's second-worst offense and fourth-worst net rating. NBA Top 100 players, ranked: How Nikola Jokić, SGA, Luka Dončić and more stack up as new season begins Sam Quinn The offseason: The Hornets drafted Knueppel with the No. 4 pick, wing Sion James with the No. 33 pick and Kalkbrenner with the No. 34 pick. They somehow picked up a future second-round pick by trading Nurkić for Sexton, and they also made yet another trade with the Suns, giving up Mark Williams (for real this time) and Micić for the No. 29 pick (which they used on forward Liam McNeely) and a 2029 first-rounder. In free agency, they reunited with Plumlee and signed Dinwiddie, both for the minimum, and they re-signed Mann to a three-year, $24 million deal. Las Vegas over/under: 27.5 wins, per BetMGM The Conversation Hornets believer: The most important thing I have to say is that Kon is a pro . If you just watch Knueppel play for five minutes, you can see it all: The processing speed, the shooting, the off-ball movement, the competitiveness, the physicality. He reminds me so much of Desmond Bane , and I think he's the perfect kind of prospect for this team: He'll be a stabilizing force and solid complementary player from Day 1, plus he has star upside. With him and Brandon Miller on the wing, I feel better about the Hornets' core than I have in ages. In a few weeks, everybody's going to say Miller is having a ""breakout"" season, and it will only be half-true. Yes, I expect him to take a step forward, but even if he comes back the exact same player as he was before his wrist injury, his efficiency will tick up naturally because he won't have to carry a crazy load anymore. Hornets skeptic: I sure hope that's true about Miller. In his rookie season I really liked how he stepped up when Ball was out, but the numbers in those minutes last season -- 51.4% true shooting and 31% usage -- were discouraging. And with all due respect to Knueppel, the perfect prospect for this team would have been the guy he played with in college and went No. 1 to Dallas. Bane is an interesting comp, but what if Knueppel is more like Gordon Hayward ? I don't mean the younger, much more athletic version; I mean the one the Hornets had a couple of years ago. At this level, Knueppel's poor foot speed and generally unremarkable athleticism could be major issues, especially on defense. And if this team is going to continue to build around LaMelo Ball -- if you like, we can debate the wisdom of this! -- then the other guys need to be plus defenders. Hornets believer: You know what I meant about Knueppel. Winning the lottery would have been nice, obviously, but, failing that, it was ideal to get a player who will be at least a solid connective role player right away and could be closer to a primary playmaker down the road. Young Hayward isn't a bad comp in that respect, but Knueppel is much stronger than Hayward was at this stage. He was definitely a plus defender at Duke, and, unless Charles Lee asks him to press small guards 94 feet for some reason, I don't see quickness being much of a problem. Re: Ball, let me guess … you think the one-legged 3s are silly, he's not a winning player and the Hornets should just trade him? Hornets skeptic: I wouldn't put it quite like that. At this point, though, the burden is on Ball to prove that he is a winning player. Defensively, he can make amazing reads off the ball, but he's not always engaged and he needs to put up much more resistance one-on-one. Offensively, he might have the best highlights in the whole league, but the shot selection is still a mess and he still doesn't put much pressure on the rim as a driver. I want to see him improve his finishing, get to the line more often and generally be more intentional when he's initiating in the halfcourt. I also want to see him simply be available more often, as he's played just 105 total games over the last three seasons. Should the Hornets trade him? I mean, if I were them, I'd at least listen to offers. Given that he's signed to a contract that will pay him $46.4 million in 2028-29, though, I doubt they're getting a ton of calls about him. Hornets believer: We are talking about a 24-year-old who has already made an All-Star team and averaged 25 points per game in an NBA season. We are also talking about one of the most creative passers on the planet. Ball is far from a finished product, but that's to be expected. And between the injuries and the questionable decisions the franchise has made since drafting him, he hasn't exactly been in the best position to develop over the past few years. Still, he's gotten much stronger, and I've seen flashes of him improving in some of the ways you've outlined. Especially when Grant Williams and Josh Green get healthy, I think this year's Hornets will be able to put lineups on the court that minimize his weaknesses and accentuate his strengths much more effectively than they have recently. And in the spirit of being patient with young players, I must note that I'm curious to see if Tidjane Salaün is part of the solution in 2025-26. Charlotte knew he was a project when it drafted him, and he looked a lot more comfortable at summer league than he did as a rookie. Hornets skeptic: I'm not writing off Salaün before his 21st birthday, but I'm not getting my hopes up, either, and I'd be more optimistic about the Hornets if they'd taken Matas Buzelis instead. I'm glad you brought him up, though, because I sort of feel about him the way I feel about the team. As a prospect, Salaün's main selling points were that he plays extremely hard and has a high ceiling by virtue of his physical tools. In the same way, the idea of the Hornets is intriguing every year. Maybe Ball stays healthy and rounds out his game, maybe they turn into fun League Pass team that puts up tons of points and gets enough stops to string some wins together. But you can't seriously expect either Charlotte or the guy it picked No. 6 in 2024 to do anything serious this season, can you?",https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/the-conversation-have-the-hornets-quietly-put-a-nice-core-together,Sport,BBC,,https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2025/10/14/5e1f4780-3755-411e-a789-8f134a817317/thumbnail/1200x675/cdba5b92b2e47f66d4ad95861d660e41/kon-hornets-imagn.png,2025-10-14T21:44:41+00:00,0ab69a94b4af5831497b9d84e33fe6e072e44338
85e31c7830f8,"Broncos, Commanders to host former Titans' first-round WR on visit, per report","treylon burks, treylon burks injury, tennessee titans news, aj brown trade, denver broncos, bo nix, washington commanders, jayden daniels, terry mclaurin injury","Getty Images The Denver Broncos and Washington Commanders are interested in adding a wide receiver as we near the halfway point of the regular season, as NFL Media reports that the two teams will host former Tennessee Titans first-round pick Treylon Burks on a visit. Burks hit waivers earlier this month, and predictably cleared them coming off injury. The former No. 18 overall pick in the 2022 NFL Draft tore his ACL in practice last year, and then broke his collarbone during a training camp practice session in July. The Titans infamously selected Burks with the pick acquired from the Philadelphia Eagles in the A.J. Brown trade. He failed to live up to expectations, catching 53 passes for 699 yards and one touchdown in just 27 career games played. Injuries unfortunately headlined Burks' career to date, as he's never played more than 11 games in a single season. However, just 25 years old, Burks could benefit from a change of scenery. The Broncos' passing attack has been disappointing this season, as it ranks No. 16 in the NFL (206.8 passing yards per game). Courtland Sutton is the only wide receiver averaging over 42 yards per game. Bo Nix completed just 4 of 10 passes for 49 yards in the second half of the ugly win over the New York Jets Sunday in London, and his 88.2 passer rating ranks No. 24 in the NFL . As for the Commanders' potential interest in Burks, their wide receiver room is injured. Terry McLaurin missed the last three games due to a quad injury, Noah Brown only played two games this season due to groin and knee injuries, then Deebo Samuel played through a heel injury during Washington's Monday night loss to the Chicago Bears . Chris Moore and rookie Jaylin Lane emerged as Jayden Daniels ' leading receivers in Week 6. Burks was a legitimate star at Arkansas, and picked up First Team All-SEC honors in 2021 after catching 66 passes for 1,104 yards and 11 touchdowns in 12 games played. However, he struggled to find his footing in the NFL.",https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/broncos-commanders-to-host-former-titans-first-round-wr-on-visit-per-report,Sport,BBC,,https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2025/10/14/9e786b18-7416-4605-b807-7143ccf6a06f/thumbnail/1200x675/7ba74aa5fc1146c692fcf4415cd775d5/treylon-burks.jpg,2025-10-14T21:39:51+00:00,fddbe5527a5bdea88377927c07c528c94d6d12dd
ba219bee77fe,"Fantasy Football Week 7 Wide Receiver Preview: Waiver adds, starts, sits, numbers to know, and more",,"The wide receiver position has been decimated by injury early in the 2025 season, and that continued in Week 6 with Garrett Wilson , Emeka Egubka, Puka Nacua , and Marvin Harrison Jr . leaving their games. As of now, we don't expect any of them for Week 7. We also aren't ranking DJ Moore , who spent Monday night in the hospital and is now day-to-day, according to Head Coach Ben Johnson . The only positive news is that none of these injuries are considered season-ending. We should get all four back sooner rather than later, just like we are anticipating getting Rashee Rice , CeeDee Lamb and Mike Evans back in Week 7. You don't need me to tell you but they should move right back into your starting lineup. One of the ramifications of all these injuries is that it becomes almost impossible to get away from struggling starters, even in bad matchups. That obviously includes A.J. Brown and Keenan Allen , but this week it may also include Jerry Jeudy . Jeudy leads the Browns with a 21.7% target share since Dillon Gabriel took over as QB and the team could be without David Njoku in Week 7. His opponent, the Dolphins , have given up at least one touchdown to a receiver every week. Last week Keenan Allen was the first wide receiver this season to see at least seven targets against the Dolphins and score fewer than 13 PPR Fantasy points. Tee Higgins probably falls in the same boat after posting a season-high 62 receiving yards against the Packers . The Steelers are giving up 160 yards per game to the position. Here is the rest of the Week 7 WR Preview: Week 7 WR Preview WR Preview Numbers to Know 29.5% -- Mike Evans had a 29.5% target share the first three weeks of the season. If he is active, you should start him. 15.3% -- George Pickens had a 15.3% target share the first two weeks with CeeDee Lamb. He has seen a 24.3% target share since Lamb went down. We are expecting Lamb back in Week 7. 50.5% -- Over half of the Seahawks air yards have gone to Jaxon Smith-Njigba . 2.53 -- Amongst wide receivers with at least 30 targets, Tre Tucker's 2.53 Fantasy points per target ranks second only to DK Metcalf . 6.2 -- Kendrick Bourne's 6.2 yards after catch per reception ranks third behind DK Metcalf and Khalil Shakir . This is a product of the Kyle Shanahan system and Bourne is a WR3 at worst until Ricky Pearsall gets back or Jauan Jennings gets healthy. 17.6% -- Van Jefferson led the Titans with a 17.6% target share after Calvin Ridley left early. It was the first time he has seen more than two targets in a game this year. 79.5% -- Josh Reynolds has a 79.5% route share over the last three weeks. He is probably the WR1 in New York until Garrett Wilson gets back. 37 -- The Colts are giving up 37 PPR FPPG to wide receivers this year. Ladd McConkey and Keenan Allen are both starts if Quentin Johnston remains out.

f8a420d80c49,NBA player rankings: The case for Shai Gilgeous-Alexander as the best player in the league,"shai gilgeous-alexander, sga, thunder, oklahoma city, okc, oklahoma city thunder, nba top 100 players, why shai gilgeous-alexander is no. 1 player, nba","Shai Gilgeous-Alexander put together one of the all-time great individual seasons for an NBA star in the 2024-25 season when he became the first player to win the league's scoring title, MVP, Finals MVP and a championship in the same season since Michael Jordan pulled off the same astonishing feat in 1997-98. And yet, despite producing a season we haven't seen in almost 30 years, I found myself on an island when ranking Gilgeous-Alexander in the top spot as the CBS Sports staff put together its Top 100 players in the NBA ahead of the 2025-26 season. That is because Nikola Jokić is busy rewriting history books himself, and he is a more than worthy candidate for that No. 1 position. The three-time MVP produced the best statistical season of his career in 2024-25, averaging a monstrous triple-double (29.6 points, 12.7 rebounds, 10.2 assists) and doing so on outrageous efficiency (66.3% true shooting). NBA Top 100 players, ranked: How Nikola Jokić, SGA, Luka Dončić and more stack up as new season begins Sam Quinn What I won't do here is argue against Jokić's greatness or insinuate he is anything short of an all-time great. I will state the case for Gilgeous-Alexander occupying the top spot for the upcoming season, as I believe we are witnessing the emergence of a superstar with similar dominance, but at the point guard position. Gilgeous-Alexander is the best version of the traditional, three-level scoring guard we've seen since Jordan. Even at his peak, Kobe Bryant didn't match the ruthless efficiency with which Gilgeous-Alexander operates as a high-volume scorer, never topping 46.9% from the field. Gilgeous-Alexander, meanwhile, has averaged north of 30 points per game in three straight seasons, shooting 51.0% or better in all of them. Beyond the efficiency, what separates Gilgeous-Alexander as a scorer from many of his contemporaries is his consistency. He has become the thing that separates the elite from just the greats -- inevitable. There are plenty of players in the NBA capable of great things in any given game, but an exceptional few who reach that level on a nightly basis. He has counters prepared for every defensive approach, allowing him to continue getting to his spots (and, yes, the foul line), scoring with efficiency, and keeping the Oklahoma City offense on track -- avoiding the pitfalls of grinding OKC's offense to a halt while trying to create for himself. He scored fewer than 20 points in a game one time in the 2024-25 regular season (an 18-point outing in the fourth game of the season) while scoring 30 or more on 49 occasions. In the playoffs, he had three outings below 20 points, while scoring 30 or more in 15 of the Thunder 's 23 playoff games en route to the title, even while struggling with his three-point shot against defenses trying to force anyone else to beat them. For as much as we discuss Jokić orchestrating everything for the Nuggets , Gilgeous-Alexander serves as an equally important engine for Oklahoma City. His 34.8% usage rate last season was third in the league, behind only LaMelo Ball and Giannis Antetokounmpo , with a key difference being SGA was doing so on the league's third best offense (119.2 offensive rating) -- Antetokounmpo's Bucks were 10th (115.1) and Ball's Hornets were 29th (106.7). It's exceedingly rare for a team as successful and efficient as the Thunder to rely so heavily on one player for creation, but that's a testament to Gilgeous-Alexander's abilities as both a scorer and facilitator. He pulls all of the strings for the Thunder and has learned how to toe the line between being an elite scorer and individual creator, while also keeping his teammates involved and engaged. Gilgeous-Alexander is tasked with making the right decisions with the ball almost all the time and does so astonishingly well, as his efficiency extends beyond scoring. He turns it over at a freakishly low rate, as his 8.6% turnover rate is the lowest of any of the top 20 in usage rate in the NBA last season. Big news, NBA fans.

Claim your offer now : Gilgeous-Alexander couples that offensive prowess with high-level defense, operating as a plus-defender like a select few of his elite offensive peers. He led the league in defensive win shares last year (4.8), unquestionably a byproduct of a dominant team defense from Oklahoma City, but he plays his part in making the Thunder elite on defense both at the point of attack and as a versatile, switchable cog in the machine. That two-way ability puts Gilgeous-Alexander in a rare breed of superstar. It is what makes the Thunder not just a title contender but the runaway favorite entering the season. At 27 years old, the Canadian star is just entering his prime, and the terrifying proposition for the rest of the league is that it's possible he's still capable of being even better, with a long runway in front of him to rack up more accolades, titles and awards. Jokić is the current gold standard for sustained excellence as a superstar. He has three MVPs and two runner-up finishes in the last five years, producing stat lines never seen from anyone, much less a center. However, I believe Gilgeous-Alexander has a chance to pull off a similar run at the point guard position. He benefits from having the longest title window possible in the modern NBA with the construction of this Thunder team, but make no mistake, they're in that position because of him. The SGA era may very well be upon us, and I wouldn't be surprised if he's carrying the torch as the league's best player for years to come.",https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/nba-player-rankings-the-case-for-shai-gilgeous-alexander-as-the-best-player-in-the-league,Sport,BBC,,https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2025/10/14/d5202b75-d649-44cf-bed1-3d3e234afcc6/thumbnail/1200x675/e942f1d029e094408c0426d9bd79977f/sga-imagn-7.png,2025-10-14T21:22:54+00:00,f77cea53b78f94e5325d89a850d03d6d2c50e2ec

It's not enough to have one or two stars. You have to have a team full of elite contributors. Every year, we rank the top 100 players in the NBA , and lately, those rankings have been pretty predictive of how that season plays out. At the time of our rankings last season, three teams tied with six selections apiece. They were the NBA champion Oklahoma City Thunder as well as the conference finalist New York Knicks and Minnesota Timberwolves . Ironically, two of those teams, New York and Minnesota, went on to make a blockbuster trade after that list was initially published last September that pushed the Timberwolves up to seven selections, giving last year's Western Conference finals a total of 13 Top 100 players. Our previous champion, Boston, had all five starters ranked in the top 62, and the year prior, Denver won it all with four players in the top 75. The lesson here is relatively straightforward. As tempting as it is to fixate on the top handful of slots on a list like this, every single slot ultimately matters. We've moved beyond an NBA in which a top-five player or two can win a title on their own. They need players scattered throughout these rankings to stand by their side when gut-check time arrives in May and June. Big news, NBA fans.

There are now 48 teams after FIFA decided to expand from the old 32-team format that had been in place since the 1998 World Cup. The 2026 edition will take place in the United States, Canada, and Mexico, kicking off on June 11, 2026, at Estadio Azteca in Mexico City, and will end on July 19 at MetLife Stadium in New York City. With the tournament's expansion, the European confederation (UEFA) is guaranteed 16 slots of the 48 teams, while the African confederation (CAF) has nine, and the Asian confederation (AFC) has eight. There will also be a minimum of six each from South America (CONMEBOL) and the Confederation of North, Central America and Caribbean Association Football (CONCACAF). On top of this, for the first time in history, the Oceania Football Confederation (OFC) has one guaranteed slot, while the remaining two spots will be decided through intercontinental playoffs. Three teams have already secured qualification to the first men's World Cup in their history. Uzbekistan, Jordan, and Cape Verde will all be at the World Cup for the first time, and more first-timers could join them as the dust settles. With a population of 524,877, Cape Verde became the second-smallest nation to ever qualify for the World Cup, behind only Iceland, which had a population of 350,000 when they qualified for the 2018 World Cup.

But the second-placed team in each group will head to a playoff phase. Those 12 second-placed teams will be joined by the four best UEFA Nations League group winners. That means that teams such as Wales, Romania, Sweden, Northern Ireland, Moldova, and San Marino could have chances to be in the UEFA playoff even if they don't finish second in their groups. That second round will see 16 teams drawn into four paths with two rounds of single-match playoffs that will lead to a final with the four overall path winners heading to the World Cup. Due to that process, no UEFA teams will take part in the inter-confederation playoff. These also won't conclude until March of 2026. A tough route for Nigeria CAF qualifying could also see some powerhouse teams struggle to make the World Cup. South Africa and Cape Verde winning their groups will send Nigeria and Cameroon into the playoff round. Each of the nine group winners will all head directly to the World Cup in spots that have been decided, but only the four best second-placed teams will advance to the second round, which will take place during the November international window. That round will see those four teams face each other in a playoff that will determine the CAF representative in the inter-confederation playoff. Teams qualified for CAF playoffs: DR Congo Burkina Faso Cameroon Nigeria Who makes the inter-confederation playoffs? The final World Cup participants won't be determined until March of 2026, following the draw for the World Cup groups.

In 2006, I was diagnosed with a genetic defect that has led to chronic kidney disease. After a rough summer, I'm undergoing dialysis as we look for a kidney transplant.

I'll see you all at MetLife Stadium & The Shoe very soon."" Mangold played at Ohio State from 2002-05, and was selected by the Jets with the No. 29 overall pick in the 2006 NFL Draft .

93288c1d93e4,Lane Kiffin explains why Kirby Smart is 'college football's best coach' ahead of Ole Miss vs. Georgia showdown,,"Getty Images There isn't a coach in college football that Lane Kiffin respects more than Kirby Smart — an active one, anyway. Kiffin's fifth-ranked Ole Miss Rebels are one of only two unbeaten SEC teams left on the board and are looking to win their second straight against the No. 9 Georgia Bulldogs for the only the second time since 1990. ""I think in five years, in the regular season, they've only lost to Alabama and then in our game here last year ... so it's a very challenging team to always play, especially there,"" Kiffin said . ""So we're going to have to have a great week of preparation and prepare to go on the road in a very tough environment with elite players and a phenomenal coaching staff, led by Kirby (Smart) and what he's been able to do. ""I said yesterday in the call (with media) when asked that he finds a way to win a lot of games in a lot of different styles and overcome a lot of adversity in games and keep his team together. That's why he's the best coach in college football now."" Gunning for their first playoff appearance in program history, the Rebels control their destiny the rest of the way with Saturday's game marking one of only two left on the slate against a ranked opponent.

Raiola doubled down when asked about that post, going as far as to say that Rhule is ""locked in as ever"" despite the rumors. ""It doesn't phase him at all,"" Raiola said.

That means the 2025 Fantasy basketball rankings are beginning to solidify, with the latest Fantasy basketball ADP listing Nikola Jokic, Shai Gilgeous-Alexander and Victor Wembanyama as the top consensus picks. Veterans such as Giannis Antetokounmpo, Luka Doncic and Anthony Edwards are also popular first-round picks. LeBron James has an ADP of No. 21 as he's set to miss a few weeks with sciatica on his right side. Can you trust those Fantasy basketball picks at the top of drafts, and which Fantasy basketball sleepers, breakouts and busts do you need to be aware of? Before making any 2025-26 Fantasy basketball picks, be sure to check out the 2025 Fantasy basketball rankings and cheat sheets from the proven computer model at SportsLine .

This model is powered by the same people who powered projections for all three major Fantasy sites. These cheat sheets and rankings, available for leagues on many major sites, are updated multiple times every day. Last year the model called a breakout season for Stephon Castle, predicting that he would finish 25 spots ahead of consensus ADP at his position. The result: Castle won NBA Rookie of the year honors after averaging 14.7 points, 4.1 assists and 3.7 rebounds per game and finished as the No. 51 guard in average Fantasy points per game. The model also nailed James Harden as a sleeper last year before he put together his first All-Star season in three years and called Paolo Banchero's and Victor Wembanyama's breakout seasons before they went on to win NBA Rookie of the Year honors as well. Now, SportsLine has simulated the entire NBA season 10,000 times and released its latest Fantasy basketball rankings 2025-26, along with plenty of sleepers, breakouts and busts. Head to SportsLine now to see these 2025-26 Fantasy basketball rankings . Top 2025 Fantasy basketball sleepers One of the top 2025 Fantasy basketball sleepers the model is predicting: Bucks guard Kevin Porter Jr. After spending the 2023-24 season out of the league, Porter joined the Clippers last season before being acquired by Milwaukee at the trade deadline. He proceeded to become one of the Bucks most consistent players, averaging 11.7 points and 3.7 assists in just 19.9 minutes, and over his last five games of the season, Porter put up 20.2 points, 6.6 rebounds, 6.2 assists and 2.8 steals. Porter should see a huge jump in playing time this year with the injury and subsequent trade of Damian Lillard. Porter is penciled in to be Milwaukee's starting point guard, and outside of Giannis Antetokounmpo, no other player on the Bucks' 2025-26 roster averaged more than 2.9 assists last year. Thus, the team will need both his ball-handling and playmaking skills, and Porter has already shown he can produce when given ample minutes. In the 2022-23 season with Houston, he was one of just five NBA players to average at least 19 points, five rebounds, five assists and 1.4 steals per game. He is someone whose production should far exceed his 2025 Fantasy basketball ADP of 93. See more Fantasy basketball sleepers 2025 here . Top 2025 Fantasy basketball breakouts One of the 2025 Fantasy basketball breakouts the model has identified: Jazz point guard Isaiah Collier, who has an ADP of 137. The No. 1 ranked prospect in the Class of 2023, Collier starred at USC for one season before being the 29th overall pick by Utah in 2024. He began as a backup but then wrestled the starting job away from Keyonte George, who was an All-Rookie selection the year prior. Collier really hit his stride towards the end of the season and averaged 15.9 points and 7.1 assists over his final seven games of his rookie year. Already one of the league's youngest teams, Utah then jettisoned vets Jordan Clarkson, Collin Sexton and John Collins in the offseason as it has fully embraced a youth movement. Thus, the 21-year-old Collier should have no shortage of opportunities, and he plays in an offense conducive for lots of stats. The Jazz ranked fifth in pace last season as they want to utilize those young legs to their advantage. The model slots Collier ahead of Klay Thompson and Jalen Suggs, despite those two being drafted earlier on average. Identify other Fantasy basketball breakouts 2025 here . Top 2025 Fantasy basketball busts As for players to avoid, the model lists Pelicans guard Jordan Poole as a Fantasy basketball bust. Poole was one of the major pieces in a trade between the Wizards and Pelicans in the offseason. The 26-year-old now goes to New Orleans, where he'll have to be a bit more of a complimentary player to Zion Williamson. New Orleans also brings in two lottery picks -- Derik Queen and Jeremiah Fears -- so Poole could lose some of his scoring opportunities as the season progresses. Poole is being picked in the seventh round, according to the latest ADP, but SportsLine's model has players such as Jrue Holiday and Immanuel Quickly, both of whom are being picked later, as better values.

9573ccc36d5f,"Cowboys' Jerry Jones open to trade before NFL deadline, mulling 'room' for a George Pickens contract extension","nfl trade deadline, nfl trade rumors, nfl trades, cowboys trey hendrickson trade rumors, cowboys trade rumors, cowboys trade, jerry jones news, george pickens stats, george pickens contract, george pickens news","FRISCO, Texas -- Three weeks away from the 2025 NFL season's trade deadline , the Dallas Cowboys are at a crossroads in terms of how their football team is playing. The offense and defense are literally polar opposites of each other: the Cowboys' offense is third in scoring (29.7 points per game) and first in total yards per game (387.5), but the defense ranks 31st in points (30.7) and last in total yards (411.7) allowed per game. The 2025 Cowboys (2-3-1) are on track to become NFL's third team ever with the most offensive yards gained and defensive yards allowed per game alongside the 1955 Chicago Bears (8-4 finish) and the 1985 San Diego Chargers (8-8 record). Those teams missed the playoffs. Yet, Cowboys owner and general manager Jerry Jones is certainly open to making a trade before the Nov. 4 deadline. ""We have thought all along that if we see a way to improve this year with a trade at the deadline, then we'll take advantage of it,"" Jones said Tuesday. ""That's what we positioned for to start this year -- to have ammunition to do things if we have an opportunity. ... I don't have a trade in mind right now at all. If that comes about right now if someone is on the phone calling."" If there were a trade to be made, Jones would likely look at doing so on the defensive side of the ball to help the aforementioned scoring and total defenses. Dallas is equipped to make a blockbuster deal since the Cowboys are equipped with four first-round picks across the next two draft after trading All-Pro edge rusher Micah Parsons to Green Bay for Pro Bowl defensive tackle Kenny Clark and two first-rounders. The last time Jones pulled the trigger on an in-season trade around the deadline and parted with a first-round pick was during the 2018 season. That's when the Cowboys started 3-4 in their first year without Dez Bryant , the franchise's all-time leader in receiving touchdowns (73). Following a narrow 20-17 defeat at Washington in Week 7 of that year, the Cowboys parted with their 2019 first-round pick the next day and acquired Pro Bowl wide receiver Amari Cooper from the Raiders . That move sparked Dallas to a 7-2 finish, ending the regular season with a 10-6 record and atop NFC East. Would Jones consider making a trade of that magnitude in 2025 to help his ailing defense? He was quick to point out that Clark only counts for $3 million on the Cowboys' 2025 cap sheet this season after being traded over from the Packers a week before the season kicked off. That puts Dallas in a place where making a deal for 2024 NFL sacks leader and Cincinnati Bengals edge rusher Trey Hendrickson , hypothetically speaking, feasible. Dallas currently has $31.145 million in cap space , which is the NFL's second-highest figure this season behind only the New England Patriots ($53.653 million), according to OverTheCap.com . Hendrickson's 2025 cap hit is $25.166 million. ""If there is a trade that would help the defense, we're in position to make that trade,"" Jones said. ""I want to remind everybody... one of the great things about our trade that we had with Green Bay is that our tackle [Clark] makes about $22 million a year. He costs us, too. We're getting a 20-something million-dollar player for $2 million, $3 million right now, and he's playing about as well as anybody on [our] defense. Why do I bring that up? That alone has increased our flexibility of being able to look at potential trades right whereas you might have had hand cramps before. ""So, we're in position to look at a trade. That doesn't mean we're going to make one. We certainly had in mind when we started the season that we were going to have ammo to be more flexible in terms of what we do with the roster as we move along this year and, of course, as we get into the next couple of years."" While most of the conversation with Jones was spent addressing the nature of his underachieving defense, he made sure to note the high-level play of both quarterback Dak Prescott , who has thrown for 10 touchdowns and no interceptions in the past three games, and wide receiver George Pickens , who has a receiving touchdown in five consecutive games. Jones alluded to the potential of getting All-Pro wide receiver CeeDee Lamb (ankle sprain), rookie first-round pick and right guard Tyler Booker (ankle sprain) and All-Pro returner/wide receiver KaVontae Turpin (foot) back in Week 7 for the Cowboys' game against the Washington Commanders . The team hopes to get all three on the practice field this week and test their potential availability for Sunday, coach Brian Schottenheimer said Monday. ""Our offense is playing at a level that, we can play better, but I'm pretty proud of how we played so far,"" Jones said Tuesday. ""We do have some serious help on the way, and that's part of the reason I feel as good as I do, because Dak is playing outstanding. ""Certainly, Pickens is playing outstanding. And we've got some other people that are really doing their part that are showing up. I'm going to be pretty general here because I like what we're doing over there [on offense]."" Another element that Jones, team chief operating officer Stephen Jones and vice president of player personnel Will McClay will factor into their calculus when weighing the possibility of a deadline deal are explosive linebacker DeMarvion Overshown (knee) and rookie third-round pick cornerback Shavon Revel (knee) potentially returning. Overshown has been working out on the resistance cords with the Cowboys' rehab group off to the side at practice lately. The linebacker's availability is a topic for every team personnel meeting when the front office and coaching staff discusses players who are rehabbing injuries. He doesn't anticipate Overshown returning until at least after the Cowboys' mid-November Week 10 bye. ""It does add to try to speculate on how Overshown is going to impact this defense,"" Jones said. ""It's speculation at best. The same thing with Revel. We hear about him doing things out here that are just amazing, but he hasn't played in the NFL. You know that's going to cost you some place if he's on the field. ""So, that's part of the nuances that you have to work through. We will weigh what are the likelihood of the players that we've got coming back, how they will impact and where that will put this team as opposed to if we should add a player in a trade."" Will Jones kick off extension talks with WR George Pickens? Pickens has been everything that Dallas hoped for when it landed the electrifying wide receiver and a 2027 sixth-round pick in early May's deal with the Pittsburgh Steelers for a 2026 third-rounder and 2027 fifth-rounder. His six receiving touchdowns tie the Detroit Lions' Amon-Ra St. Brown atop the NFL this season, and Pickens' 525 receiving yards rank third. Pickens is having an impact similar to the aforementioned Cooper -- Pickens is tied for the most receiving touchdowns (six) in a player's first six games with the Cowboys since the 1970 AFL/NFL merger, according to CBS Sports research. Jones concurred, which is why he's thinking about carving out future cap space for the 24-year-old Pickens next offseason. ""Well, again, I don't want to sit here, and as you know, that even has a competition to it in its very aspect of it,"" Jones said when asked if he would begin contract talks with Pickens. ""He is doing more than we could, than we did expect or that we could have expected. What's really special is he's a real plus to have around the team. He's a real plus around his teammates. He's a great plus around those coaches. Those coaches really think highly of him, and so he's not only doing it on the field. He's doing it as a part of the team concept. That's very important and, in his particular case, should be noted. ""We'll weigh that. We knew full well that if things really went like we wanted them to go, certainly, we need to think about having some room available if we're going to pay a second receiver at that level."" Remorseful about Dak Prescott having a Tony Romo-like career trajectory A case can be made that no one in the NFL this season is quarterbacking at a higher level than Prescott. He enters Week 7 leading the NFL or ranking in the top five across a multitude of passing statistics despite playing missing Lamb, center Cooper Beebe (ankle sprain) and Booker the past three weeks. Prescott's current 71.6% completion rate would rank as the highest in NFL history by a player who also led the league in pass attempts, according to NFL Pro . Prescott leads the NFL with 229 passing attempts entering Week 7. Completion Percentage 71.6% 4th Pass Attempts 229 1st Completions 164 1st Pass Yards 1,617 2nd Pass TD 13 2nd Passer Rating 104.6 9th Sack Rate 3.0% 3rd Completions of 25-Plus Yards 17 1st Acknowledging Prescott's high-level play led to Jones getting remorseful about the years in which Dallas contended for Super Bowls with Prescott but ultimately fell short . The Cowboys' 61.3% regular-season-winning percentage (78-49-1) with Prescott as their starter is the eighth-best rate among 28 quarterbacks to start at least 70 games in the span of his career since 2016. That's right in line with his predecessor Tony Romo , who went 78-49 (61.4%) as the Cowboys' starting quarterback. Romo's was good for the seventh-best mark among 24 quarterbacks to start at least 70 games in the span of his career as a starter from 2006 through 2015. ""I think Dak is a heck of a quarterback,"" Jone said. ""All of them [seasons] ... were there at times, right around that rim. One of the things that I probably have a sense of remorse is that we didn't, when those guys were playing quarterback like that, to get one -- get a chance to get a Super Bowl . ""... You don't think that I didn't jump up a lot of mornings in those years that we've had Dak, or we had Romo when they were ready to play and say, 'Let's get a Super Bowl.' It would be done. I didn't say, 'Let's don't,' being tongue in cheek. ""What I regret is we haven't been able to get it done. We have been around the rim a lot. ... I don't hang my hat on teams that are playing well enough to have a shot at it. I think this team has a shot. I think some of those teams did.""","Cowboys'%20Jerry%20Jones%20open%20to%20trade%20before%20NFL%20deadline,%20mulling%20'room'%20for%20a%20George%20Pickens%20contract%20extension",Sport,BBC,,https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2025/10/14/efdb3da5-9d59-4c74-8335-06890c04e342/thumbnail/1200x675/ff2417f0e9a7ed38ad9a70bfe2fc1812/jerry-jones-cowboys.jpg,2025-10-14T20:36:05+00:00,ed4e2e4cc5c901f9d968a71275ab05bd6a4a251e
5b58e1d3ba22,DJ Moore injury: Bears wide receiver hospitalized following Chicago's win over Commanders,,"Getty Images Bears receiver DJ Moore was hospitalized overnight following Monday night's 25-24 win over the Commanders . Bears coach Ben Johnson provided a bit more information on Moore's status on Tuesday afternoon, offering a positive update and clarifying it was a groin injury when he spoke with ESPN 1000 in Chicago on Tuesday . ""It was precautionary. I think we got some good news on that,"" Johnson said. ""He should be coming back today, here, and I think he'll be day-to-day going forward. It was a groin deal that he was dealing with and I think we're going to be OK."" Moore left the stadium in an ambulance after the game for precautionary medical evaluation. He was initially inside the locker room with the rest of his teammates following the Bears' last-second win over the Commanders. The Bears did not disclose what he was being evaluated for. During the game, Moore caught three passes for 42 yards and had two runs for 10 yards. He appeared to be in some discomfort after taking a hit to his midsection during the first half. Moore, 28, is in his third season with the Bears, who acquired him via a trade with the Panthers in March 2023. A former first-round pick, Moore has enjoyed a solid career in the NFL . He's had four seasons with at least 1,100 receiving yards that includes a career-best 1,364 yards in 2023, his first season with the Bears.

Vandy has a chance to register another statement victory this week when the No. 10 LSU Tigers come to town. Believe it or not, Vanderbilt is favored in this matchup by 2.5 points over at FanDuel Sportsbook . According to CBS Sports Research, this is the first time the Commodores have been favored vs. LSU since 1948, and the first time they have been favored vs. a ranked opponent since at least 1978. Vanderbilt has played an astounding 176 straight games vs. ranked opponents as an underdog. LSU is coming off a 20-10 win over South Carolina , in which Garrett Nussmeier threw for 254 yards, two touchdowns and two interceptions. Nussmeier still hasn't reached 300 yards passing this season, and is 2-4 as a starter vs. ranked teams, having thrown 10 touchdowns compared to nine interceptions in those contests. Vanderbilt, on the other hand, is coming off a bye and looking to bounce back following the Week 6 loss to Alabama . Diego Pavia's offense was held to 14 points in Tuscaloosa after averaging 49 points per contest over the first five games of the season. Pavia is 2-5 vs. ranked teams, but a win on Saturday would mark the first time Vandy has ever beaten multiple AP top-15 teams in a season.

Patriots vs. Titans sees New England on the road for the third straight week, and the Pats, led by former Tennessee coach Mike Vrabel, are  touchdown favorites as they look to complete this road trip 3-0. Additionally, the Chiefs fans will get to see their team take part in a 1 p.m. ET kickoff for the only time through the first 11 weeks of the 2025 NFL season. Kansas City is an 11.5-point home favorite, per the latest Week  NFL odds, as they host the Raiders. Then, a Monday night doubleheader sees the Texans visiting the Seahawks in the nightcap at 10 p.m. ET. This is just the second time in the last 20 years that the Texans will play at Seattle, with the home team favored by 3.5 points. Week 7 NFL picks could account for several factors from recent performance to NFL betting trends to scheduling oddities.

Philly is coming off a mini-bye after playing last Thursday, but Minnesota is coming off a full bye after covering versus Cleveland in Week 5. Covering, or winning, isn't something that the Eagles have done recently as they're 0-2 both against the spread and straight up over their last two games. The Philly offense is in shambles as its two lowest point totals over the last calendar year have come in its two most recent contests. Since the start of last year, Minnesota has the second-best spread record overall (14-8-1), as well as the second-best spread record at home (7-3). As for the Eagles, they haven't shown a tendency to bounce back versus the line after outright defeats, which is what they're coming off with a Thursday loss to the Giants. Philadelphia is only 3-7 against the spread after a straight-up loss since the start of the 2023 season. The model has Minnesota prevailing versus the spread well over 50% of the time. See which other teams to pick here . Another one of its Week 7 NFL predictions: the Broncos (-7, 40) cover versus the Giants in well over 50% of simulations. Bo Nix is a perfect 6-0 against the spread versus NFC opponents in his career and is also 7-1 versus the line as a home favorite. A big part of that is Denver having the most ferocious pass rush the NFL has possibly ever seen. Last year, Denver's 63 sacks were the most in the league and the second-most by any team over the last two decades. This year, Denver is on pace for an NFL record of 85 sacks which would shatter the record of 72 set by the 1984 Chicago Bears. Now, the Broncos get to face a rookie quarterback in Jaxson Dart who gets sacked at the ninth-highest rate in the league. Dart has looked impressive at home but had three turnovers in his lone road start at New Orleans, which was both a defeat and a spread loss for New York. After taking down one New York quarterback in Justin Fields nine times in Week 6, Denver is projected to take down another, in Dart, at least five times on Sunday, as the Broncos are forecasted to win by double-digits. The model also says the Over hits well over 50% of the time. See which other teams to pick here . How to make Week 7 NFL picks The model has also made the call on who wins and covers in every other game on the Week 7 NFL schedule and just revealed four teams that win by nearly 70% of simulations, or more, potentially giving you a huge payday.

fa4396b191a9,Conan O’Brien’s Emmy-Winning TBS Series Lands at Radial Entertainment,,"Radial Entertainment has struck a deal for the U.S. distribution rights to Conan O’Brien’s long-running TBS late-night talk show, the company revealed at Mipcom . The agreement gives Radial exclusive rights across multiple digital platforms — including subscription and ad-supported streaming, transactional video, and digital networks — for all 11 seasons of “Conan,” which aired from 2010 to 2021. Jeff Peisch made the announcement on behalf of Radial Entertainment. “Conan O’Brien is widely regarded as one of the most original and enduring figures in American comedy,” Peisch said. “His influence has shaped modern comedy, and his work continues to resonate with audiences across generations. We are excited to continue his extraordinary late-night legacy by allowing fans to watch his decade-long series on streaming platforms.” The talk show featured O’Brien and sidekick Andy Richter mixing comedy sketches with interviews spanning entertainment, sports, politics and culture. The series became particularly recognized for its international remote segments and won multiple Emmy Awards during its run. The show later spawned “Conan Without Borders” and “Conan O’Brien Must Go,” both of which stream on HBO Max. Jeff Ross served as longtime executive producer. O’Brien was inducted into the Television Academy Hall of Fame in earlier this year, capping a nearly 30-year career in late-night television. Bruce David Eisen of Eisen Law represented Radial Entertainment alongside Peisch in negotiations. The newly formed Radial Entertainment, which operates the FilmRise and Shout!

It also meant a special returning guest — former pro Kym Johnson returned to the ballroom as a guest judge. Early in the night, Robert Irwin dedicated his dance to his mother, who became his rock after his father, Steve Irwin, died. The contemporary number left the entire room in tears, including judge Derek Hough who could barely get words out. Hough previously danced with Bindi Irwin. Elaine Hendrix, best known for her role in “ The Parent Trap ,” dedicated her dance to Lisa Ann Walter, her costar from the 1998 film. Dennis Quaid, who starred in the movie with the pair, was cheering her on from the audience. Danielle Fishel dedicated her dance to “ Boy Meets World ” teacher Bill Daniels, who played Mr. Feeny to her Topanga Lawrence. In addition to Daniels, who joined Fishel and Pasha Pashkov on the ballroom floor, her costars also came to support her, including Will Friedle (Eric Matthews), Betsy Randle (Amy Matthews), William Russ (Alan Matthews), Trina McGee (Angela Moore), Bonnie Bartlett (Lila Bolander and Williams’ wife), Matthew Lawrence (Jack Hunter) and Alex Désert (Eli Williams). The show ended without an elimination, surprising the cast. At the end, Dylan Efron was at the top of the leaderboard, and Andy Richter was at the bottom.

38704eba5a87,"Robbie Brenner Steps Up TV Production at Mattel Studios as Toymaker’s ‘Masters of the Universe,’ ‘Matchbox,’ ‘Barney’ Franchises Head to Theaters",,"CANNES — Robbie Brenner told Mipcom attendees that the toymaker is focused on stepping up its TV development and production now that the Mattel Studios arm has been unified under her leadership as president and chief content officer. Brenner spoke Tuesday with Leo Barraclough, Variety ‘s international features director, in the keynote address on Day 2 of the Mipcom content market. Brenner detailed her unlikely journey from independent film producer to Mattel Studios leader. She reflected on the out of the box success of “Barbie,” which was Mattel’s first feature film effort under the new regime led by CEO Ynon Kreiz, who recruited Brenner to the toymaker in 2018 to drive the key component of his strategy to transform Mattel into a media and entertainment firm in addition to its consumer toy and game businesses. “It’s not very often get to go to work and dream every day,” Brenner said of her role. After joining the company she was impressed at Mattel’s culture of detail and innovation. She appreciates Mattel’s history of “having the integrity to make these toys the best they can be,” Brenner said. Her job is to “find ways to honor that and celebrate the brands do it I a way feels interesting an out of the box and unexpected.” Brenner explained to Barraclough how Mattel tries to cast the creative auspices of its projects well with distinctive writers, directors, producers and stars who have a feel for the material. Travis Knight, the writer-director steering Mattel’s second feature film release, “Masters of the Universe,” is a “fanboy” who grew up playing with the action figures and knows the mythos behind them. The live-action film starring Nicholas Galitzine, Camila Mendes and Idris Elba bows June 5, distributed by Amazon MGM Studios. “He knows the characters,” she said of Knight. “His attention to detail has been wonderful to watch.” The same is true for Daniel Kaluuya, who is taking on a fresh take on the purple dino for A24, with Ayo Edebiri co-starring. Stunt peformer turned director Sam Hargraves is in the driver’s seat for the “Matchbox” feature in the works with John Cena and Jessica Biel. And one day before Brenner’s Mipcom appearance, her studio unveiled a pact with M. Night Shamalayan to develop a series based on the iconic  Magic 8 Ball toy. “Television is a big push for us – I feel good about where my team is,” Brenner said. Brenner had been the company’s head of film. She was promoted in June to oversee TV as well. She firmly believes there will be benefits to the tighter alignment. “Everything historically has been so separated” between film and TV at studios,” Brenner said. “Everything really is so blended today….For us to all exist under the umbrella together — we figure out what is the best past forward for each one of these brands to navigate that together as television and theatrical.” (Pictured: Variety’ s Leo Barraclough with Mattel Studios’ Robbie Brenner at Mipcom in Cannes on Oct. 14)",https://variety.com/2025/film/news/robbie-brenner-tv-mattel-studios-1236553077,Entertainment,BBC,Cynthia Littleton,https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/MIPCOM2025-1593-e1760484703794.jpg?w=1000&h=563&crop=1,2025-10-15T00:59:48+00:00,3d5afc125f0ac155c3edc974aa6daab87aad4f36
d3d806ccd838,"Ten Classic D’Angelo Deep Cuts, From Prince Covers to Duets With Erykah Badu and Lauryn Hill",,"D’Angelo, who died Tuesday at the age of just 51, was indisputably a musical genius, but he didn’t leave much behind: Just three studio albums and an under-the-radar live disc over the course of two decades, and a handful of remixes and loose tracks. So a “10 greatest songs” (out of maybe 35 original compositions) seems kind of pointless — just cue up any of a dozen “greatest hits” playlists and click. But his discography is deep enough to hold some buried treasure, and we’ll throw in some rarities like his live sets with Questlove — which were mostly soul covers from the ‘60s and ‘70s — and the “Soul Blends” cassette , which was the first whiff we got of “Voodoo” back in the fall of 1999 when a then-little-known New York DJ named Mark Ronson made a mixtape of several of its songs. Scroll down as we go deep into the crates and uncover for some vintage deep cuts from one of the leading lights of R&B. VIDEO “I Found My Smile Again” (1995) An outtake from “Brown Sugar” and a rare unreleased D’Angelo original, this song — which premiered on the soundtrack of the 1996 blockbuster “Space Jam” film — only saw the light of day because, according to Questlove , the film’s producers blanched at the song they originally submitted: an early version of “Playa Playa,” which was finally released on “Voodoo” nearly four years later (which gives a sense of how long “Voodoo” was in the oven). The song fits in perfectly with “Brown Sugar” and would slot nicely between sides one and two. VIDEO “Can’t Hide Love” (live 1995) The “Live at the Jazz Cafe” EP was such a low-key release that many people didn’t know it existed before it was re-released in 2014. The album was originally an EP, then re-released in Japan with a bonus cut, and finally the full set, nearly 20 years after it was recorded. But this September 1995 set, captured live shortly after the release of D’Angelo’s debut, finds him in full flight as a 21-year-old, with his paramour at the time, the late Angie Stone, delivering stellar backing vocals. The album includes three covers — his take on Smokey Robinson’s “Cruisin’,” also featured on “Brown Sugar”; the Ohio Players’ “Heaven Must Be Like This,” only on the Japanese version; and finally this faithful but stunning take on Earth Wind & Fire’s classic “Can’t Hide Love.” VIDEO “Heaven Must Be Like This” (live 1995) Another “Jazz Café” track, this Ohio Players cover was originally relegated to the Japanese version of the EP and is curiously not available on the otherwise-full version of the album or Spotify, suggesting that D’Angelo himself was unhappy with the track. It’s hard to understand why he would be: It’s a beautifully sung version, featuring raindrop-like electric piano, a full horn section and some gorgeous backing vocals from Stone. VIDEO “Me and Those Dreaming Eyes of Mine” Def Squad remix / DJ Premier remix (1996) The one full collaboration between D’Angelo and the great DJ Premier, “Devil’s Pie” (originally released on the “Best Man” soundtrack two years before it appeared on “Voodoo”) was enough to have fans thirsting in vain for more. But lurking deep in the crates on vintage EMI Records 12” singles are some remixes from D’s first album, including ten different mixes of one of his all-time great love songs, “Me and Those Dreaming Eyes of Mine” (guess they had bigger budgets back then). It’s an embarrassment of riches, but the two winners are the DJ Premier remix and the even more innovative “Def Squad Remix,” featuring Erick Sermon and Redman. VIDEO VIDEO “Your Precious Love” with Erykah Badu (1996) This cover of the 1967 Marvin Gaye-Tammi Terrell duet, featured on the “High School High” soundtrack, was recorded well before these two stellar singers became neo-soul icons. It sticks closely to the original arrangement, but the two deliver the song — a classic from the Ashford and Simpson catalog — with the reverence it deserves. VIDEO “Girl You Need a Change of Mind” (1996) Another cover, this one by original Temptations member Eddie Kendricks, from his second solo album, 1973’s “People… Hold on.” This is the classic-soul D’Angelo that fans jones for, complete with string stabs at the end and stellar falsetto; it’s of a piece with “Brown Sugar” but already anticipating the hard funk of “Voodoo.” From Spike Lee’s 1996 film “Get on the Bus” about a group of Black men traveling cross-country to participate in the Million Man March. VIDEO “She’s Always in My Hair” (1997) It’s surprising that D’Angelo didn’t record more Prince covers, given the vast influence and his reverence for the man, but it figures that when he did, he’d dig deep into the crates. This psychedelicized track — the 1985 B-side of “Raspberry Beret,” fact fans — is one of the best of Prince’s many non-LP tracks, and was often performed live during D’Angelo’s “Brothers in Arms” jams with Questlove. VIDEO “Everybody Loves the Sunshine” (1999) This is probably the best known song by the great jazz musician Roy Ayers (although there are many great ones). Recorded by D’Angelo with Questlove and released as the B-side of the European CD single of “Untitled (How Does It Feel),” the song is perhaps deservedly obscure , as the two are just jamming tentatively on the track. It’s not as strong as the other songs on this list (but hopefully compensated by the bonus track at the end.) VIDEO “Glass Mountain Trust” with Mark Ronson (2010) This bizarre track from Ronson’s oddly obscure third solo album “Record Collection” may be the deepest cut here: The album doesn’t come up in Ronson’s Spotify discography (it’s credited to “Mark Ronson and the Business Intl”) and is one of the strangest songs in both of their catalogs. Led by blaring ‘80s synthesizers and a pounding beat, the song features a distorted lead vocal from D’Angelo, who accompanies himself on multitracked backing vocals with the occasional soul shriek thrown in for good measure. VIDEO Questlove and D’Angelo SuperJam (live at Bonnaroo Festival, 2012) The “Brothers in Arms” played several public jams on classic R&B covers during this era, at least two of which (witnessed by this writer) were a bit disorganized and shambolic. However, for this set at Bonnaroo, they delivered the goods: With a directive not to play any D’Angelo or Roots songs, they were accompanied by a stellar hybrid band featuring virtuoso bassist Pino Palladino, Time guitarist Jesse Johnson, members of the Roots, D’Angelo’s Vanguard and even longtime Prince saxophonist Eric Leeds. The all-star group tore up covers of songs by the Funkadelic, the Ohio Players, Jimi Hendrix, Sly & the Family Stone, Prince (of course), the Time and even Led Zeppelin and the Beatles. Highlights are featured in this multi-part mini-documentary about the set. VIDEO BONUS: “Nothing Even Matters” with Lauryn Hill (1998) It’s absurd to call a song from one of the top-selling albums in history a “deep cut,” yet this soulful duet is tucked away as track 12 on “The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill” and is often overlooked. The two harmonize beautifully, freestyling over the song’s last couple of minutes, underpinned by D’Angelo’s unmistakable electric piano embellishments. The mutual admiration was real: Hill wrote just a few hours after his death was announced: “I regret not having more time with you. Your undeniable beauty and talent were not of this world… You sir, moved us, stirred us, inspired and even intimidated others to action with your genius.” VIDEO",https://variety.com/2025/music/news/dangelo-best-deep-cuts-prince-cover-1236553100,Entertainment,BBC,Jem Aswad,https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/GettyImages-50856805-e1760487931797.jpg?w=1000&h=563&crop=1,2025-10-15T00:27:45+00:00,f66fc922b4448b4edabbd48bd5422c589f93729f
31e40342b2a4,"Michael Mann on His Inspirations for ‘Thief,’ ‘Heat’ and ‘The Insider’ and Commitment to Authenticity: ‘I Find Things That You Cannot Make Up’",,"It’s fitting that Michael Mann should be honored at the Lumière Festival in Lyon, since the director of “Ali,” “Heat” and “The Insider” began his filmmaking career in France. After graduating from the London Film School in 1967, Mann — who grew up in Chicago and switched course from a literature degree to filmmaking after seeing Stanley Kubrick’s “Dr. Strangelove” — was dead-set on directing dramatic features. In the meantime, he found his way to Paris, documenting the student uprisings of 1968 as they happened. Mann adopted the protestors’ slogan, “ Prenez une caméra et descendez dans la rue ” (or “pick up a camera and take to the streets”), achieving what the American networks could not: He talked student leaders Daniel Cohn-Bendit, Alain Geismar and Alain Krivine into granting him interviews, edited into a segment called “Insurrection” and broadcast on NBC. Mann subsequently reshaped that footage into an abstract 8-minute short film (“Jaunpuri”), which screened at the Cannes Film Festival in 1971. Skip forward 10 years, and Mann was invited to world premiere his first theatrical movie, “Thief,” in competition at Cannes — quite an honor for a helmer so early in his career. “At that time, ‘The Jericho Mile,’ which is the Movie of the Week I did before ‘Thief,’ got theatrical distribution and was playing on the Champs-Élysées down the street from ‘Thief,’” Mann explains. “It was completely bizarre, particularly in those years when you couldn’t make a movie on an iPhone, after a decade or more of trying to get a film made, to have two of them [released] at the same time.” Hosted by Cannes chief Thierry Frémaux, the Festival Lumière will screen all 12 of Mann’s theatrical features this week, before presenting him with the Lumière Award, following a master class on Friday, Oct. 17. The retrospective will also include his pilot for the Max series “Tokyo Vice” — the apotheosis of where Mann’s elevated aesthetic and commitment to authenticity intersect — and “The Jericho Mile,” a sports movie shot inside Folsom Prison featuring real inmates as extras. “Human intelligence does not diminish when you confine a geographical space. If anything, the opposite happens,” says Mann, who was impressed by the prisoners’ interest in the craft. The director remembers one who asked him questions for half an hour, by the end of which he understood the principles of blocking and coverage. The production arranged for several inmates to get Taft-Hartley permits, Mann explains, “which meant they got SAG minimum, on their commissary as opposed to making, you know, three cents an hour stamping license plates or something.” The one condition: There couldn’t be a race war between Folsom’s three gangs — the Black Guerrilla Family, the Bluebirds (a precursor to the white supremacist Aryan Brotherhood) and “La eMe,” Mexican Mafia — or the warden would pull the plug. Three minutes into the movie, a member of the Black Brotherhood tells a journalist, “Everything’s for real. That’s our motto,” and while that isn’t exactly Mann’s mantra, the sentiment certainly aligns with his commitment to authenticity. “The real is where I go. That’s where richness is for me: in real people, real circumstances, real trials and emotional tidal waves that happen to people,” Mann says. That applies whether he’s telling contemporary stories such as “The Jericho Mile” and “The Insider” or adapting a work of historical fiction, à la “The Last of the Mohicans.” For that film — a pre-revolutionary American epic starring Daniel Day Lewis and Madeleine Stowe — Mann not only insisted on period-accurate set dressing and wardrobe, but also endeavored to channel the psychology of the time: What a young woman growing up in London’s updwardly mobile Portman Square neighborhood in 1757, would have thought, what kind of music she might have listened to (the answer: Handel) and so on. “The Insider” was inspired by Mann’s friendship with Lowell Bergman, the “60 Minutes” producer (so ferociously embodied by Al Pacino) whose bombshell segment featuring a Big Tobacco whistle-blower spooked the upper ranks of CBS. Mann had been talking to Bergman about other projects when the network self-censored his interview with Jeffrey Wigand (played by Russell Crowe in “The Insider”), giving him personal insight into a big-business scandal. “Whether I’m doing ‘Manhunter’ or ‘Heat 2’ or ‘The Insider,’ it’s the deep dive into real people … what it felt to be in their shoes and look through their eyes,” Mann says. “That’s what occupies me in the writing or the preparatory stage of it, and that’s where I find things that you cannot make up.” In the case of “Manhunter,” Mann had been in contact with a convicted killer named Dennis Wayne Wallace, around whom he was trying to write an original screenplay, when he read Thomas Harris’ “Red Dragon.” The novel presented Mann with a plot in which to place his character, overwriting Harris’ ideas for “the Tooth Fairy” serial killer Francis Dollarhyde with details that interested Mann about Wallace, who had a fantasy relationship with a woman. Wallace had told Mann that their love song (in the killer’s imagination, at least) was “In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida,” which is why the director used that music over the end credits. More important still was Dollarhyde’s dark humor, also drawn from Mann’s correspondence with someone who had truly been capable of such crimes. “Just because something’s real doesn’t mean you have to use it,” Mann clarifies. The director, who defined the ultra-stylized ’80s look of “Miami Vice” and brought a similarly heightened aesthetic to “Manhunter,” famously fills entire notebooks with the research and background material that go into preparing each project. In “Thief,” he cast John Santucci, the thief on whom James Caan’s title character was based, as a corrupt cop. But his commitment to authenticity went one step further: “All the props in ‘Thief’ weren’t props. They were all his burglary tools,” Mann says. The thermal lance Caan uses to penetrate the safe was Santucci’s own burning bar. Other facets, like problems the characters had with wives and kids came from Mann’s interviewing Santucci and immersing himself in the man’s life. (Mann helped him get a SAG card and made him a series regular on his series “Crime Story” in the late ’80s.) In studying both criminals and law enforcement officers over the years, Mann has repeatedly been fascinated by both the complexities and contradictions in their personalities. “I’ve interacted with some spectacular people in law enforcement who do things that are quite incredible and so complicated, they could be CEOs of major Fortune 500 companies, and nobody will know because they’re taking down Khun Sa, who was responsible for producing 65% of the world’s heroin.” Mann invites interactions with anyone who could potentially be a character, adapting their life experience into details for his movies. Perhaps the most impactful example is Chicago police officer Chuck Adamson, whose experience informed aspects of Mann’s spectacular 1995 crime film “Heat.” Adamson once told Mann about how he’d sat down to coffee with Neil McCauley, a highline professional thief he later killed in a shootout — the basis of a dramatic tête-à-tête between Pacino and Robert De Niro in what has arguably become the director’s most iconic scene. According to Mann, Adamson highly respected his quarry. “When he met him, he realized they had a kind of unique rapport. He really liked this guy, and at the same time, as he put it, he’d blow him out of his socks without thinking twice about it.” Mann appreciated that paradox and understood why McCauley might agree to meet with Adamson at the Belden Deli on Clark St. in Chicago. It was a way for both men to assess one another, since they understood — as the audience does in “Heat” — that they were on a collision course where only one would walk away alive. I’m partial to the terse, reality-based psychology of “The Insider” and “Thief,” and the sleek, darker-than-noir elegance of “Collateral.” Still, “Heat” is Mann’s most elaborate film — in terms of both logistics and the sheer breadth of its ensemble — and the one many consider to be his masterpiece. In making it, Mann issued a challenge to himself: Could he construct a vast panoply of three-dimensional people (where even the most minor supporting characters have fully imagined lives) and program a meticulously precise structure that brings everything to that explosive collision? No wonder it’s the only sequel he intends to make. The way Mann works, his characters are so fully realized that their lives seem to continue even when the cameras aren’t rolling. It’s only a matter of time before they do on “Heat 2” (which picks up right after the original with Val Kilmer’s character, Chris Shiherlis, a role Leonardo DiCaprio has reportedly been considering). The novel’s been published, and the notebook is being prepared. Because when Mann calls “action,” he means it.",https://variety.com/2025/film/news/michael-mann-festival-lumiere-award-heat-2-1236553042,Entertainment,BBC,Peter Debruge,https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/MSDHEAT_EC011.jpg?w=1000&h=563&crop=1,2025-10-14T23:30:00+00:00,c33afc26bb7bfbb1fdd003f1f517c947b6d88e48
f00ce2ec1ac0,‘General Hospital’ Star Kirsten Storms Says She Is Undergoing Brain Surgery for an Aneurysm: ‘We’ve All Got Times When Things Aren’t Great’,,"Kirsten Storms offered “ General Hospital ” fans an update on her health Monday evening, sharing that she is scheduled for a surgical coiling procedure “sometime in the next two weeks” to address a brain aneurysm that her doctors discovered in a January scan. In a statement on social media, the longtime soap actress, who has been featured on “General Hospital” for 20 years, wrote that the discovery “majorly freaked” her out. She added that she “wanted to post this because even though my brain seems to be sorta lowkey rebelling against me, it does allow me to understand that we’ve all got times when things aren’t great. If we can, we will do our best to do what is best for ourselves and loved ones.” Per the Mayo Clinic, a coiling procedure involves “feeding a soft, flexible wire into the aneurysm via a catheter. The wire coils inside the aneurysm and seals off the aneurysm from the artery.” The surgery is done as a preventative to keep the aneurysm from rupturing. Storms also addressed a false online rumor that Storms had been hospitalized in January because she “tried to ‘unalive'” herself, when she was actually meeting with her neurosurgeon for a brain scan to monitor a cyst. “I couldn’t understand why a person would make up something that terrible, when they had no idea why I was really there,” she wrote. “There are a few really bad apples out there” Storms took a hiatus from “General Hospital” to move from Los Angeles to Tennessee in July, with her role of Maxie being temporarily played by Nicole Paggi. “Since the January scan showed a new, but *very small*, squatter (aka cyst) on my brain stem – it was clear I needed [to] change some things in my life asap,” Storms wrote in her most recent post. “For my own personal reasons, no longer living in Los Angeles was very important to me. The biggest reason for the move was [my daughter] Harper, but a lot of it was for my physical and mental health.” Storms previously underwent a craniotomy in 2021 for the removal of noncancerous cysts from her brain. Storms has since returned to “General Hospital” in pre-taped scenes, but she remains on leave from the long-running series. In prior social posts, the actress has floated that she could be “back in December, maybe November.” She first joined the soap in May 2005.",https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/general-hospital-kirsten-storms-brain-surgery-1236553002,Entertainment,BBC,J.

And I also could see how he got more frustrated and he found ways to deal with that… I learned through the process of this [documentary] that he was so nervous about eating in front of people because of paparazzi. He developed a poor eating habit where he’d be like, ‘Alright, well I’m not going to eat all day. I’m going to eat at night.’” Chris continued, “When I hear stories like that I just felt so bad for him because it’s like, ‘How cornered are you?’ And you really want in those moments, as his son or as his friend, to be able to grab him by his shoulders and say, ‘Why the fuck do you have to do this? Just who cares? Have a sandwich and get mad about it.’” “John Candy: I Like Me” hails from director Colin Hanks and producer Ryan Reynolds. The movie, which premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival before making its streaming debut Oct. 10 on Amazon Prime Video , contains many examples of interviewers essentially calling Candy “fat” to his face during press junkets. “You look at interview after interview and horrible things are being said and questions are being asked in incredibly insensitive ways,” Hanks told Variety before the film’s TIFF premiere. “It’s tough to see how uncomfortable John was in almost every clip. And he had good reason, because some of the things that people said were disgusting and would not be tolerated today.” Reynolds revealed during a Q&A at TIFF that he personally called one of the journalists who mocked Candy ‘s weight after seeing archival footage of the insulting incident while working on the documentary as a producer. “There was a lot of things we left out of the documentary, journalists just saying stuff. One of them I called,” Reynolds said about the journalist who was caught on camera making inflammatory comments about Candy’s weight. “I didn’t put it in the movie, but I called this journalist just to see.” “I wasn’t trying to shame him or teach him a lesson,” Reynolds continued. “[I told him] I took it out of the movie, but I’d put it in the movie if you wanted to talk about it, because maybe you have something to say about it, about your journey whenever it comes to something like that. We had such a thoughtful conversation about it.” “John Candy: I Like Me” includes interviews with dozens of the late comedian’s former co-stars, including Eugene Levy, Martin Short, Murray, Dan Aykroyd and Catherine O’Hara.

bb3c15ce3b4d,Laurie Metcalf on Signing Onto ‘Monster: The Ed Gein Story’ Without Seeing a Script and Charlie Hunnam’s Nude Scene,,"Laurie Metcalf ’s four decades-long acting career spans comedy and drama across television , film and stage . However there’s one dream she has yet to fulfill. “I’ve always wanted to do a musical,” Metcalf tells me. “But my range of notes is only about seven notes. It would have to be an extremely specific part. I don’t know if that would ever be in my future, but I think it would be such a rush to be in a musical. “I’m going to start manifesting it,” she adds with a laugh. Metcalf is currently on Broadway in the preview run of Samuel D. Hunter ’s “Little Bear Ridge Road,” a family drama about a woman (Metcalf) who reunites with her estranged nephew (Micah Stock). Opening Oct. 30 at the Booth Theatre, the play marks Metcalf’s seventh collaboration with director Joe Mantello . “I’m a little tired, but this is my favorite place to be,” Metcalf, who earned Tonys in 2017 and 2018 for her work in “A Doll’s House, Part 2” and “Three Tall Women,” tells me over the phone on a recent Friday afternoon. “We have two previews under our belt and I’m going in for notes this afternoon. We’re fine-tuning things. This is my happy spot.” Laurie Metcalf and Micah Stock in “Little Bear Ridge Road.” Photo: Julieta Cervantes “Little Bear Ridge Road” comes on the heels of the release of “ Monster: The Ed Gein Story ,” the Netflix series starring Charlie Hunnam as serial killer Ed Gein’s and Metcalf as his domineering and religious fanatic mother Augusta Gein. After co-creators Ryan Murphy and Ian Brennan pitched her the project, “I agreed to do it without even having seen a script,” Metcalf recalls. This latest installment of Murphy’s “Monster” franchise focuses on Ed’s relationship with his mother and how her abusive actions may have contributed to his horrifying killing spree in the mid-1950s. “It’s nature versus nurture, right?” Metcalf says. “I think it’s both cases for him.” One of the series’ most powerful and disturbing scenes shows Augusta scolding a grown-up Ed as he stands in front of her completely naked. “I’m sitting in that chair looking at a grown man, but I’m lecturing him like he was seven years old,” Metcalf explains. “I’m not seeing him as a grown man, but seeing him still under my care and under my sick supervision. It’s a mother-son teaching experience. It’s simplistic, but warped. But mentally, it was helpful to see him like that.” Metcalf gives high praise to director Max Winkler. “Despite the subject matter and the tone of the series, the shooting space was really fun,” she says. “It’s hard to picture that sort of work being fun, but it was because it was very collaborative. Max is so open to accidents that might happen in the scene. He would feed me things in between takes that we could do. Some he used, some he didn’t. I really liked working that way. The job itself was a wonderful set to be on, despite how dark it is.” After filming “Monster” and a week before heading back to Broadway, Metcalf wrapped her next television project, Dan Levy and Rachel Sennott’s eight-episode Netflix mob comedy “Big Mistakes” about two siblings (Levy and Taylor Ortega) who are caught up in organized crime. Metcalf plays their mother. “I read the pilot, and then I wrote my agent immediately saying, ‘100% want to do this,’” says Metcalf, who earned three Emmys for her work on “Roseanne” and another for a guest spot on “Hacks.” “I saw how unique it was for a single camera, half-hour comedy.” I tell Metcalf that I grew up in a mob neighborhood in Queens, NY. “You’re gonna like this,” she says. “It’s very, very funny and very unexpected. I don’t think the audience ever gets out ahead of where it’s going.”",https://variety.com/2025/tv/columns/monster-laurie-metcalf-charlie-hunnam-nude-scene-1236552066,Entertainment,BBC,Marc Malkin,https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Laurie-Metcalf.jpg?crop=0px%2C34px%2C1920px%2C1080px&resize=1000%2C563,2025-10-14T22:00:00+00:00,7e83fc053e0620d4a0b889960bb1c91e4088c3d5
7ee9b6fa7e30,Flamingos are making a home in Florida again after 100 years – an ecologist explains why they may be returning for good,"estuaries, everglades, flamingos, florida, ornithology, south florida","Hurricane Idalia blew a flamboyance, or flock, of 300-400 flamingos that was likely migrating between the Yucatan Peninsula and Cuba off course in August 2023 and unceremoniously deposited the birds across a wide swath of the eastern United States, from Florida’s Gulf Coast all the way up to Wisconsin and east to Pennsylvania. After Hurricane Idalia, more than 300 credible sightings of flamingos across the eastern U.S. were reported. Audubon Florida I’m an estuarine scientist . That means I study ecosystems where fresh water flows into the ocean . I’ve spent 35 years with Audubon Florida studying the ecology of American flamingos and other wading birds in Florida Bay, Everglades National Park . So naturally, I was thrilled and intrigued by the sudden arrival of these flamingos. One of the birds was rescued in the Tampa area after nearly drowning in the Gulf of Mexico. His rescuers named him Peaches. A colleague and I were able to place a GPS tracking device and a bright blue band around his spindly leg, with the code “US02” engraved in white letters. Melissa Edwards, Avian Hospital Director at Seaside Seabird Sanctuary, holds Peaches still while Dr. Frank Ridgley of Zoo Miami and the author, Dr. Jerome Lorenz, place a band and GPS tracker on his leg. Dr. Lorenz has banded or supervised the banding of nearly 3,000 roseate spoonbills, but Peaches was his first and only flamingo to date. Linda Lorenz We were hoping to track his movements and see whether he ended up settling in Florida. Unfortunately, a few days after Peaches was released back into the wilds of Tampa Bay , the tracking device failed. His last reported sighting was on a beach near Marco Island on Oct. 5, 2023. Then, in June 2025, I received an email from colleagues at the Rio Lagartos Biosphere Reserve in Yucatan, Mexico, who had photographed Peaches, blue band still in place , nesting in the reserve. Peaches’ story is the latest piece in the historical puzzle of flamingos in Florida. Though the native population disappeared more than 100 years ago, recent events lead me to believe that flamingos may be coming back to the Sunshine State, and that their return has been facilitated by the concerted effort to restore the Everglades and coastal ecosystems. Decimation of a population In 1956, ornithologist and founder of the National Audubon’s Everglades Science Center Robert Porter Allen wrote “ The Flamingos: Their Life History and Survival ,” which is still considered a seminal document on the history of flamingos in Florida. In his book, Allen cites several historical and scientific manuscripts from the 1800s that indicate flamboyances of hundreds to thousands were seen in the Everglades, Florida Bay and the Florida Keys. Allen documents the demise of flamingos in the late 1800s, in Florida and throughout their Caribbean and Bahamian range. Like all wading birds in Florida, they fell victim to the women’s fashion trend of adorning hats with bird feathers . Wading bird feathers were literally worth their weight in gold. Led by the National Association of Audubon Societies’ vocal opposition, the grassroots environmental movement that followed brought about laws prohibiting the hunting and sale of bird feathers. But enforcement of those laws in sparsely populated Florida was difficult, and on two occasions deputized Audubon wardens were murdered protecting wading bird nesting colonies. Fortunately, within a few years, societal pressure turned the tide against the practice of wearing feathers. The passage of the Migratory Bird Treaty Act in 1918 officially ended the feather trade. Given legal protection, most species managed to reestablish huge nesting populations in the Everglades by the 1930s-1940s, presumably migrating from remote populations in Central America and the Caribbean. Flamingos, however, did not. A long road to recovery In 1956, 40 years after hunting had ended, Allen estimated flamingo populations were only about 25% of what they had been in the previous century, with numbers plummeting from 168,000 to 43,000 breeding adults. They nested in significant numbers at only four locations, compared to 29 historically. Flamingos’ unique breeding behaviors and their longevity – they can live up to 50 years in the wild – may account for their struggle to bounce back. Other Florida wading birds can nest multiple times a year at different locations, laying three to five eggs at a time. Flamingos, on the other hand, nest only once a year, generally returning to the same location year after year, and lay only one egg. Furthermore, they prefer forming huge nesting colonies, with thousands of nests, in part due to their elaborate group courtship rituals. Reason to hope As a result of their rarity from the 1950s to 1980s, scientists – including myself – believed that any flamingos sighted intermittently around Florida were not wild birds but rather escapees from captive populations. The largest flock observed in the state between 1930 and 1976 was 14 birds spotted in Biscayne Bay in 1934, on the day after Hialeah Race Track in Miami imported a group of about 30 flamingos . The track’s owners had failed to pinion the birds, and they simply flew away upon release. But my opinion began to change in 2002, when a flamingo that was banded as a chick at Rio Lagartos was photographed in Florida Bay. In 2012, a second bird from Rio Lagartos was photographed. By that time, I had observed flamingos in Florida Bay on several occasions, including larger flamboyances of 24 and 64 individuals. Although I still thought the majority of these flocks were escapees, the banded birds provided some evidence that at least a few wild flamingos were starting to spend time in Florida. Then in 2015, my colleagues put a tracking device on a flamingo they had captured at the Key West Naval Air Station. Conchy, as we called him, was given the blue band US01 and released in Florida Bay in December 2015. He lived in Florida Bay for two years , and the fact that he stayed for that long was proof to me that it was possible for flamingos to make a more permanent home in Florida . Conchy was banded and given a GPS tracker by Dr. Frank Ridgley of Zoo Miami before being re-released into Florida Bay in 2015. In 2018, several colleagues and I published a paper laying out both evidence from historical accounts and also previously overlooked evidence from museums that flamingos were native to Florida . We also presented new data from researchers and citizen science portals that strongly indicated that wild flamingo numbers were increasing in Florida. This suggested that the population might be finally recovering. Call it a comeback Fast-forward to today, and it appears that this slow comeback may finally have legs. Six months after Hurricane Idalia, my colleagues at Audubon Florida and I conducted a weeklong online survey of flamingo sightings in Florida. We received more than 50 reputable observations. After sorting through these observations to remove duplicates, we concluded that at least 100 flamingos were left in the state . Then in July 2025, a flock of 125 individuals was photographed in Florida Bay. Based on our observations, my colleagues and I believe that the flamingos that arrived with Idalia may be reestablishing a home in Florida. Progress toward restoration The question is, why now? The 24 flamingos I saw in 1992 and the 64 I saw in 2004 didn’t take up permanent residence in the state. So what’s changed? To me, the answer is clear: Efforts to restore the Everglades and Florida’s coastal ecosystems are beginning to show progress. When I arrived in the Keys in 1989, Florida Bay was undergoing an ecological collapse . A 1993 interagency report by the federal government found that a hundred years of draining, diking and rerouting the flows of the Everglades to create urban and agricultural lands had raised the salt content of the water, making it uninhabitable for many estuarine animals . The report noted that the bay’s famous seagrass beds were undergoing a massive die-off, accompanied by algal blooms that depleted oxygen levels, thereby killing fish in large numbers. Mangrove trees were dying on its myriad islands, and birds that for decades had nested in them had disappeared. These events kick-started Everglades restoration efforts, and in 2000 the U.S. Congress passed the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan with nearly unanimous bipartisan support. With a cost in the tens of billions of dollars, it was to be the largest and most expensive ecological restoration project the world has ever seen. Today, the bay’s health is vastly improved from the condition I observe in the 1980s. Water flow has gotten better, and the salinity is back to appropriate levels to support wildlife. In 2018 and 2021, more than 100,000 pairs of wading birds such as white ibis , wood storks and roseate spoonbills nested in the Everglades. These numbers hadn’t been seen since the 1940s.

dfc784fdd7d5,Typhoon leaves flooded Alaska villages facing a storm recovery far tougher than most Americans will ever experience,"alaska, extreme storms, extreme weather, flooding, floods, forecasting, indigenous, recovery, storm surge, storms, typhoon","Remnants of a powerful typhoon swept into Western Alaska’s Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta on Oct. 12, 2025, producing a storm surge that flooded villages as far as 60 miles up the river. The water pushed homes off their foundations and set some afloat with people inside , officials said. More than 50 people had to be rescued in Kipnuk and Kwigillingok, hundreds were displaced in the region, and at least one person died . Typhoon Halong was an unusual storm, likely fueled by the Pacific’s near-record warm surface temperatures this fall. Its timing means recovery will be even more difficult than usual for these hard-hit communities, as Alaska meteorologist Rick Thoman of the University Alaska Fairbanks explains. Disasters in remote Alaska are not like disasters anywhere in the lower 48 states, he explains. While East Coast homeowners recovering from a nor’easter that flooded parts of New Jersey and other states the same weekend can run to Home Depot for supplies or drive to a hotel if their home floods, none of that exists in remote Native villages. Ex-Typhoon Halong’s storm surge and powerful winds knocked homes off their foundations and set some afloat. U.S. Coast Guard via AP What made this storm unusual? Halong was an ex-typhoon, similar to Merbok in 2022 , by the time it reached the delta. A week earlier, it had been a powerful typhoon east of Japan. The jet stream picked it up and carried it to the northeast, which is pretty common, and weather models did a pretty good job in forecasting its track into the Bering Sea. But as the storm approached Alaska, everything went sideways. The weather model forecasts changed, reflecting a faster-moving storm, and Halong shifted to a very unusual track, moving between Saint Lawrence Island and the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta coast. Ex-Typhoon Halong’s storm track showing its turn toward Alaska’s Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta. Rick Thoman Unlike Merbok, which was very well forecast by the global models, this one’s final track and intensity weren’t clear until the storm was within 36 hours of crossing into Alaska waters. That’s too late for evacuations in many places. Did the loss of weather balloon data canceled in 2025 affect the forecast? That’s a question for future research, but here’s what we know for sure: There have not been any upper-air weather balloon observations at Saint Paul Island in the Bering Sea since late August or at Kotzebue since February. Bethel and Cold Bay are limited to one per day instead of two. At Nome, there were no weather balloons for two full days as the storm was moving toward the Bering Sea. Did any of this cause the forecast to be off? We don’t know because we don’t have the data, but it seems likely that that had some effect on the model performance. Why is the delta region so vulnerable in a storm like Halong? The land in this part of western Alaska is very flat, so major storms can drive the ocean into the delta, and the water spreads out. Most of the land there is very close to sea level, in some places less than 10 feet above the high tide line. Permafrost is also thawing , land is subsiding, and sea-level rise is adding to the risk. For many people, there is literally nowhere to go. Even Bethel , the region’s largest town, about 60 miles up the Kuskokwim River, saw flooding from Halong. These are very remote communities with no roads to cities. The only way to access them is by boat or plane. Right now, they have a lot of people with nowhere to live , and winter is closing in. Native residents of Kipnuk discuss the challenges of permafrost loss and climate change in their village. Alaska Institute for Justice. These villages are also small. They don’t have extra housing or the resources to rapidly recover. The region was already recovering from major flooding in summer 2024 . Kipnuk’s tribe was able to get federal disaster aid , but that aid was approved only in early January 2025. What are these communities facing in terms of recovery? People are going to have really difficult decisions to make. Do they leave the community for the winter and hope to rebuild next summer? There likely isn’t much available housing in the region, with the flooding so widespread on top of a housing shortage. Do displaced people go to Anchorage? Cities are expensive. There is no easy answer. It’s logistically complicated to rebuild in places like Kipnuk. You can’t just get on the phone and call up your local building contractor. Almost all of the supplies have to come in by barge – plywood to nails to windows – and that isn’t going to happen in winter. You can’t truck it in – there are no roads. Planes can only fly in small amounts – the runways are short and not built for cargo planes. The National Guard might be able to help fly in supplies. But then you still need to have people who can do the construction and other repair work. Everything is 100 times more complicated when it comes to building in remote communities. Even if national or state help is approved, it would be next summer before most homes could be rebuilt. Is climate change playing a role in storms like these? That will be another question for future research, but sea-surface temperature in most of the North Pacific that Typhoon Halong passed over before reaching the Aleutian Islands has been much warmer than normal . Warm water fuels storms. A comparison of daily sea-surface temperatures shows how anomalously warm much of the northern Pacific Ocean was ahead of and during Typhoon Halong. NOAA Coral Reef Watch Halong also brought lots of very warm air northward with it.

7ebcf07cc10f,The limits of free speech protections in American broadcasting,"abc, cbs, censorship, charlie kirk, communication, democrats, fcc, first amendment, franklin delano roosevelt, free speech, jfk, jimmy kimmel, media, nbc, republicans, super bowl, us supreme court, us media, white house","The chairman of the Federal Communications Commission is displeased with a broadcast network. He makes his displeasure clear in public speeches, interviews and congressional testimony. The network, afraid of the regulatory agency’s power to license their owned-and-operated stations, responds quickly. They change the content of their broadcasts. Network executives understand the FCC’s criticism is supported by the White House, and the chairman implicitly represents the president. I’m not just referring to the recent controversy between FCC Chairman Brendan Carr, ABC and Jimmy Kimmel . The same chain of events has happened repeatedly in U.S. history. President Franklin Delano Roosevelt’s FCC chairman, James Lawrence Fly, warned the networks about censoring news commentators . Then there was John F. Kennedy’s FCC chairman, Newton Minow , who criticized the networks for not airing more news and public affairs programming to support American democracy during the Cold War. And there was George W. Bush’s FCC chairman, Michael Powell. He decided that a fleeting “ wardrobe malfunction ” during the 2004 Super Bowl halftime show – when Janet Jackson’s breast was exposed – was sufficient to punish CBS with a fine. In each of those cases, the FCC represented the views of the White House. And in each case, the regulatory agency was employed to pressure the networks into airing content more aligned with the administration’s ideology. But what’s interesting in those four examples is that two of the FCC chairmen were Democrats – Fly and Minow – and two were Republicans – Powell and Carr. As a media historian , I’m aware of the long-existing bipartisan enthusiasm for exploiting the fact that no First Amendment exists in American broadcasting. Pressuring broadcasters by leveraging FCC power occurs regardless of which party controls the White House. And when the agency is used in partisan fashion, the rival party will criticize such politicization of regulation as a threat to free speech. This recurring cycle is made possible by the fact that broadcasting is licensed by the government. Since a Supreme Court decision in 1943 , the supremacy of the FCC in broadcast regulation has been unquestioned. Such strong governmental oversight separates broadcasting from any other medium of mass communication in the United States. And it’s the reason why there’s no “free speech” when it comes to Kimmel, or any other performer, on U.S. airwaves. The FCC’s empowerment Since its establishment in 1934, the FCC’s primary role in broadcasting has been to authorize local station licenses “ in the public interest, convenience, or necessity .” In 1938, the FCC began its first investigation into network practices and policies, which resulted in new regulations. One of the new rules stated that no network could own and operate more than one licensed station in any single market. This forced NBC, which owned two networks that operated stations in several markets, to divest itself of one of its networks. NBC sued. In the first serious constitutional test of the FCC’s full authority, in 1943, the Supreme Court vindicated the FCC’s expansive power over all U.S. broadcasting in its 5–4 verdict in National Broadcasting Co. v. United States . The ruling has stood since. That’s why there’s no First Amendment in broadcasting. The Supreme Court ruled that, due to spectrum scarcity – the idea that the airwaves are a limited public resource and therefore not every American can operate a broadcast station – the FCC’s power over broadcasting must be expansive. The 1934 act, the 1943 Supreme Court decision read , “gave the Commission … expansive powers … and a comprehensive mandate to ‘encourage the larger and more effective use of radio in the public interest,’ if need be, by making ‘special regulations applicable to radio stations engaged in chain (network) broadcasting.’” The ruling also explains why the FCC can be credited with having created the American Broadcasting Company . Yes, the same ABC that suspended Kimmel in the face of FCC threats was the network that emerged from NBC’s forced divestiture of its Blue Network as a result of the 1943 Supreme Court decision. The empowerment of the FCC by NBC v. U.S. led to such content restrictions as the Fairness Doctrine , which intended to ensure balanced political broadcasting, instituted in 1949, and later, additional FCC rules against obscenity and indecency on the airwaves. The Supreme Court decision also encouraged FCC chairmen to flex their regulatory muscles in public more often. A federal appeals court ruled on Nov. 2, 2011, that CBS should not be fined US$550,000 for Janet Jackson’s infamous ‘wardrobe malfunction.’ AP Photo/David Phillip For example, when CBS suspended news commentator Cecil Brown in 1943 for truthful but critical news commentary about the U.S. World War II effort, FCC Chairman Fly expressed his displeasure with the network’s decision. “It is a little strange,” Fly told the press , “that all Americans are to enjoy free speech except radio commentators.” When FCC Chairman Minow complained about television in the U.S. devolving into a “ vast wasteland ” in 1961, the networks responded both defensively and productively. They invested far more money into news and public affairs programming. That led to significantly more news reporting and documentary production throughout the 1960s and 1970s. A ‘hands-off’ FCC In the early 2000s, FCC Chairman Powell promised to “refashion the FCC into an outfit that is fast, decisive and, above all, hands-off.” Yet his promise to be “hands-off” did not apply to content regulation. In 2004, his FCC concluded a contentious legal battle with Clear Channel Communications over comments ruled “indecent” by shock jock Howard Stern. The settlement resulted in a US$1.75 million payment by Clear Channel Communications – the largest fine ever collected by the FCC for speech on the airwaves. Powell apparently enjoyed policing content, as evidenced by the $550,000 fine his FCC levied against CBS for the fleeting exposure of singer Janet Jackson’s breast during the Super Bowl. The fine was eventually overturned . But Powell did successfully lobby Congress to significantly hike the amount of money the FCC could fine broadcasters for indecency . The fine for a single incident increased from $32,000 to $325,000, and up to $3 million if a network broadcasts it on multiple stations. Powell’s regulatory activism, done mostly to curb the outrageous antics of radio shock jocks, resulted in some of the most significant and long-lasting restrictions on broadcast freedom in U.S. history .  Thus, Carr’s 2025 threats toward ABC can be viewed in a historical context as an extension of established FCC activism. Demonstrators hold signs on Sept. 18, 2025, outside Los Angeles’ El Capitan Entertainment Centre, where the late-night show ‘Jimmy Kimmel Live!’ is staged. AP Photo/Damian Dovarganes But Carr’s threat also appeared to contradict his previously espoused values. As the author of the FCC section in Project 2025 , a conservative blueprint for federal government policies, Carr wrote: “The FCC should promote freedom of speech … and pro-growth reforms that support a diversity of viewpoints.” In exploiting the FCC’s licensing power to threaten to penalize speech he found offensive, Carr failed to promote either freedom of speech or diversity of viewpoints. If there’s one thing the Carr-Kimmel episode teaches us, it’s that more Americans should know the structural constraints in the U.S. system of broadcasting. Media literacy has proved essential as curbs to free expression – both official and unofficial – have become more popular. When the FCC threatens a broadcaster, it does so in Americans’ name. If Americans applaud regulatory activism when it supports their partisan beliefs, consistency demands they accept the same regulatory activism in the hands of their political opponents. If Americans prefer their political opposition show restraint in the regulation of broadcasting, then they need to promote restraint when their preferred administration is in power.",https://theconversation.com/the-limits-of-free-speech-protections-in-american-broadcasting-266206,Society,BBC,Michael J.

88a01980a5c4,What the First Amendment doesn’t protect when it comes to professors speaking out on politics,"academic freedom, academic work, charlie kirk, first amendment, freedom of speech, higher education, political polarization, public universities, u.s. polarization, us supreme court, us higher education, freedom of speech on campus","American colleges and universities are increasingly firing or punishing professors and other employees for what they say , whether it’s on social media or in the classroom. After the Sept. 10, 2025, killing of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, several universities, including Iowa State University , Clemson University , Ball State University and others, fired or suspended employees for making negative online comments about Kirk . Some of these dismissed professors compared Kirk to a Nazi, described his views as hateful, or said there was no reason to be sorry about his death . Some professors are now suing their employers for taking disciplinary action against them, claiming they are violating their First Amendment rights . In one case, the University of South Dakota fired Phillip Michael Cook, a tenured art professor , after he posted on Facebook in September that Kirk was a “hate spreading Nazi.” Cook, who took down his post within a few hours and apologized for it, then sued the school, saying it was violating his First Amendment rights. A federal judge stated in a Sept. 23 preliminary order that the First Amendment likely protected what Cook posted . The judge ordered the University of South Dakota to reinstate Cook, and the university announced on Oct. 4 that it would reverse Cook’s firing. Cook’s lawsuit, as well as other lawsuits filed by dismissed professors , is testing how much legal authority colleges have over their employees’ speech – both when they are on the job and when they are not. For decades, American colleges and universities have traditionally encouraged free speech and open debate as a core part of their academic mission. As scholars who study college free speech and academic freedom, we recognize that these events raise an important question: When, if ever, can a college legally discipline an employee for what they say? An aerial view of University of South Dakota’s Vermillion campus, one of the places where a professor was recently fired for posting comments about Charlie Kirk, a decision that was later reversed. anup khanal - CC BY-SA 4.0 Limits of public employees’ speech rights The First Amendment limits the government’s power to censor people’s free speech. People in the United States can, for instance, join protests, criticize the government and say things that others find offensive. But the First Amendment only applies to the government – which includes public colleges and universities – and not private institutions or companies, including private colleges and universities. This means private colleges typically have wide authority to discipline employees for their speech . In contrast, public colleges are considered part of the government. The First Amendment limits the legal authority they have over their employees’ speech. This is especially true when an employee is speaking as a private citizen – such as participating in a political rally outside of work hours, for example. The Supreme Court ruled in a landmark 1968 case that public employees’ speech rights as private citizens can extend to criticizing their employer, like if they write a letter critical of their employer to a newspaper . The Supreme Court also ruled in 2006 that 
the First Amendment does not protect public employees from being disciplined by their employers when they say or write something as part of their official job duties. Even when a public college employee is speaking outside of their job duties as a private citizen, they might not be guaranteed First Amendment protection. To reach this legal threshold, what they say must be about something of importance to the public, or what courts call a “matter of public concern .” Talking or writing about news, politics or social matters – Kirk’s murder – often meets the legal test for when speech is about a matter of public concern. In contrast, courts have ruled that personal workplace complaints or gossip typically does not guarantee freedom of speech protection. And in some cases, even when a public employee speaks as a private citizen on a topic that a court considers a matter of public concern, their speech may still be unprotected. A public employer can still convince a court that its reasons for prohibiting an employee’s speech – like preventing conflict among co-workers – are important enough to deny this employee First Amendment protection . Lawsuits brought by the employees of public colleges and universities who have been fired for their comments about Kirk may likely be decided based on whether what they said or wrote amounts to a matter of public concern. Another important factor is whether a court is convinced that an employee’s speech about Kirk was serious enough to disrupt a college’s operations, thus justifying the employee’s firing. Academic freedom and professors’ speech There are also questions over whether professors at public universities, in particular, can cite other legal rights to protect their speech. Academic freedom refers to a faculty member’s rights connected to their teaching and research expertise . At both private and public colleges, professors’ work contracts – like the ones typically signed after receiving tenure – potentially provide legal protections for faculty speech connected to academic freedom, such as in the classroom. However, the First Amendment does not apply to how a private college regulates its professors’ speech or academic freedom. Professors at public colleges have at least the same First Amendment free speech rights as their fellow employees, like when speaking in a private citizen capacity. Additionally, the First Amendment might protect a public college professor’s work-related speech when academic freedom concerns arise, like in their teaching and research. In 2006, the Supreme Court left open the question of whether the First Amendment covers academic freedom, in a case where it found the First Amendment did not cover what public employees say when carrying out their official work . Since then, the Supreme Court has not dealt with this complicated issue. And lower federal courts have reached conflicting decisions about First Amendment protection for public college professors’ speech in their teaching and research. The First Amendment is on display in front of Independence Hall in Philadelphia. StephanieCraig/iStock via Getty Images Plus Future of free speech for university employees Some colleges, especially public ones, are testing the legal limits of their authority over their employees’ speech. These incidents demonstrate a culture of extreme political polarization in higher education. Beyond legal questions, colleges are also grappling with how to define their commitments to free speech and academic freedom. In particular, we believe campus leaders should consider the purpose of higher education. Even if legally permitted, restricting employees’ speech could run counter to colleges’ traditional role as places for the open exchange of ideas.",https://theconversation.com/what-the-first-amendment-doesnt-protect-when-it-comes-to-professors-speaking-out-on-politics-266128,Society,BBC,Jeffrey C.

These students may find that the One Big Beautiful Bill Act , the big tax and spending bill that President Donald Trump signed into law over the summer, could limit how much they can borrow. Until recently, graduate students could take out two types of federal loans: Direct Unsubsidized Loans , which had a lifetime limit of US$138,500, and Grad PLUS loans , which allowed students to borrow up to the full cost of attendance, minus financial aid. But Grad PLUS loans will be eliminated next summer, with a three-year transitional period for current borrowers. That will leave only the capped loans for new borrowers, and those loans have new lifetime borrowing limits: $200,000 for students pursuing certain professional degrees , and $100,000 for nonprofessional graduate programs. If you add both undergraduate and graduate loans, there’s a new lifetime limit of $257,500 per person. That seems modest to me. Consider that the annual average costs for an undergraduate degree range from $24,920 for in-state public universities to $58,000 for private universities . That means we’re looking at up to $224,000 for a bachelor’s degree. If we add three years of law school, we’re looking at an additional $132,000 to $168,000 , respectively. Alternatively, completing four years of medical school will set you back another $268,000 to $363,000. It’s not easy to make those numbers add up to less than $257,500. As I reflect on these numbers and my journey to becoming a college professor , specializing in race and ethnic studies, one thing becomes clear: I would never have been able to earn my bachelor’s degree, two master’s degrees, and Ph.D. under these new rules. Adjusting for inflation, I took out nearly $300,000 in student loans, and I paid them all off within a decade of starting my college teaching career. For me, the system worked. I wonder how today’s aspiring professionals, especially those from less prosperous backgrounds, will manage. The future of professionals Professional students already graduate with a lot of debt – often far more than the new loan caps will allow. In 2020, more than a quarter of graduating medical students and nearly 60% of graduating dental students had borrowed more than the new limits would allow , author Mark Kantrowitz, who is an expert on student loans , has found. In 2024, nearly a quarter of medical school graduates left school with more than $300,000 in debt. The new borrowing limits will likely hit minority students especially hard. While about 61% of all graduate students take out student loans , the share is much higher for Black students compared with white students, 48% to 17%. While some might be able to supplement their federal loans with private ones – which tend to have much worse terms for borrowers – I fear that many others will be forced to end their educations prematurely. That, in turn, would worsen the already severe shortage of doctors serving the Black community . As pointed out in a 2023 report of the Journal of the American Medical Association , the shortage of Black primary care physicians is directly related to overall lower population health and ultimately higher mortality rates within the Black community. As of 2023, fewer than 6% of U.S. doctors were Black, versus 14.4% of the population . Research has suggested that student loan relief would help diversify the medical workforce . Adding new restrictions would likely have the opposite effect, making the profession more homogeneous and significantly undermining Black public health . Or consider attorneys. Law school costs have risen more than 600% over the past two decades. The average 2020 law school graduate left with $165,000 in student debt . Black law students face unique challenges, graduating with approximately 8% more debt on average than white students and facing significant wage disparities once they enter the legal workforce. Making it harder for Black students to afford law school could reduce the number of Black attorneys , which has held steady at about 5% of active lawyers over the past 10 years. Reducing access to federal student loans risks disproportionately affecting women, since they hold roughly two-thirds of all student debt . What comes next Supporters of the change say that capping graduate student borrowing will encourage universities to rein in tuition hikes . They also say private student loan providers will step in to help students. I am skeptical, but the true test will come next year. In the meantime, professional students might want to familiarize themselves with the many scholarship opportunities available. Many organizations offer a range of medical school scholarships , including those targeting women and minorities . The same is true for students interested in law school. A helpful starting point is this list of scholarships with approaching deadlines and these opportunities for women and people of color .",https://theconversation.com/new-student-loan-limits-could-change-who-gets-to-become-a-professor-doctor-or-lawyer-262008,Society,BBC,Rodney Coates,https://images.theconversation.com/files/693961/original/file-20251001-56-amo2r6.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&rect=0%2C11%2C8000%2C4000&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop,2025-10-14T12:37:48+00:00,05cbdc0b667fb2fe3f271567ef48e143d0f57869
e6ab25c4e441,In defense of ‘surveillance pricing’: Why personalized prices could be an unexpected force for equity,"consumers, data, economic policy, economics, economy, prices, pricing, redistribution, retail, surveillance, taxation","Surveillance pricing has dominated headlines recently. Delta Air Lines’ announcement that it will use artificial intelligence to set individualized ticket prices has led to widespread concerns about companies using personal data to charge different prices for identical products. As The New York Times reported, this practice involves companies tracking everything from your hotel bookings to your browsing history to determine what you’re willing to pay. The reaction has been swift. Democratic lawmakers have responded with outrage, with Texas Rep. Greg Casar introducing legislation to ban the practice . Meanwhile, President Donald Trump’s new chair of the Federal Trade Commission has shut down public comment on the issue , signaling that the regulatory pendulum may swing away from oversight entirely. What’s missing in this political back-and-forth is a deeper look at the economics. As a business school professor who researches pricing strategy, I think the debate misses important nuances. Opponents of surveillance pricing overlook some potential benefits that could make markets both more efficient and, counterintuitively, more equitable. What surveillance pricing actually is Surveillance pricing differs from traditional dynamic pricing , where prices rise for everyone at times of peak demand. Instead, it uses personal data – browsing history, location, purchase patterns, even device type – to charge a unique price based on what algorithms predict you’re willing to pay. The goal is to discover each customer’s “reservation price” – the most they’ll pay before walking away. Until recently, this was extremely difficult to do , but modern data collection has made it increasingly feasible. An FTC investigation found that companies track highly personal consumer behaviors to set individualized prices. For example, a new parent searching for “baby thermometers” might find pricier products on the first page of their results than a nonparent would. It’s not surprising that many people think this is unfair. The unintended progressive tax But consider this: Surveillance pricing also means that wealthy customers pay more for identical goods, while lower-income customers pay less. That means it could achieve redistribution goals typically pursued through government policy. Pharmaceutical companies already do this globally, charging wealthier countries more for identical drugs to make medications accessible in poorer nations. Surveillance pricing could function as a private-sector progressive tax system . Economists call it “ price discrimination ,” but it often helps poorer consumers access goods they might otherwise be unable to afford. And unlike government programs, this type of redistribution requires no taxpayer funding. When Amazon’s algorithm charges me more than a college student for the same laptop, it’s effectively running a means-tested subsidy program – funded by consumers. PBS NewsHour featured a segment on the Delta Air Lines news. The two-tier economy problem In my view, the most legitimate concern about surveillance pricing isn’t that it exists, but how it’s implemented. Online retailers can seamlessly adjust prices in real time, while physical stores remain largely stuck with uniform pricing. Imagine the customer fury if Target’s checkout prices varied by person based on their smartphone data : There could be chaos in the stores. This digital-physical divide could also create unfair advantages for tech-savvy companies while leaving traditional retailers behind. That would raise fairness considerations for consumers as well as retailers. This is related to another force that could limit how far surveillance pricing can go: arbitrage , or the practice of buying something where it is cheaper and selling it where it is more expensive. If a system consistently charges wealthy customers $500 for items that cost poor customers $200, it creates opportunities for entrepreneurial intermediaries to exploit these price gaps. Personal shopping services, buying cooperatives or even friends and family networks could arbitrage these differences, providing wealthy customers access to the lower prices while splitting the savings. This means surveillance pricing can’t discriminate too aggressively – market forces will erode excessive price gaps. That’s why I believe the solution isn’t to ban surveillance pricing entirely, but to monitor how it is put in practice. The regulatory sweet spot The current political moment offers a strange opportunity. With Republicans focused on AI innovation and Democrats fixated on bans, there’s space for a more sophisticated position that embraces market-based redistribution while demanding strong consumer protections. In my view, smart regulation would require companies to disclose when personal data influences pricing, and would prohibit discrimination based on protected characteristics such as race, color or religion – and this list needs to be created extremely carefully. This would preserve the efficiency benefits while preventing abuse. Surveillance pricing based on desperation or need also raises unique ethical questions. Charging a wealthier customer more for a taxi ride is one thing; charging someone extra solely because their battery is low and they risk being stranded is another. As I see it, the distinction between ability to pay and urgency of need must become the cornerstone of regulation. While distinguishing the two may seem challenging, it’s far from impossible. It would help if customers were empowered to report exploitative practices, using mechanisms similar to existing price-gouging protections . A solid regulatory framework must also clarify the difference between dynamic pricing and surveillance-based exploitation. Dynamic pricing has long been standard practice: Airlines charge all last-minute travelers higher fares, regardless of their circumstances. But consider two passengers buying tickets on the same day – one rushing to a funeral, another planning a spontaneous vacation. Right now, airlines can use technology to identify and exploit the funeral attendee’s desperate circumstances. The policy challenge is precise: Can we design regulations that prevent airlines from exploiting the bereaved while still allowing retailers to offer discounts on laptops to lower-income families? The answer will determine whether surveillance pricing becomes a tool for equity or exploitation.",https://theconversation.com/in-defense-of-surveillance-pricing-why-personalized-prices-could-be-an-unexpected-force-for-equity-266293,Society,BBC,Aradhna Krishna,https://images.theconversation.com/files/695678/original/file-20251010-66-cq1re2.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&rect=0%2C503%2C6000%2C3000&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop,2025-10-14T12:37:36+00:00,09222293eca16b05812dad43e9fb178f14f5106b
92790c47ff51,Starbucks wants you to stay awhile – but shuttering itsmobile-onlypickup locations could be a risky move,"business, coffee, coffee shops, consumers, dining, dunkin', economics, fast food, marketing, restaurants, starbucks, third places","When Starbucks announced that it would phase out its mobile-order pickup-only locations beginning in 2026, it raised a question: Why abandon a format seemingly built for speed and efficiency? As Starbucks CEO Brian Niccol explained the decision in an earnings call, the pickup-only stores had a “transactional” feel, lacking “the warmth and human connection that defines our brand.” While Niccol also touted the mobile-order options at its traditional coffee shops, I see Starbucks’ move as an attempt to return to its roots as a “ third place ” – a destination between home and work where people can gather and connect. But this sort of pivot comes with trade-offs – and it creates interesting market opportunities for competitors. As a marketing professor and a coffee connoisseur, I’m offering this analysis to go with your morning cup of joe. The two types of coffee shop patrons In general, coffee shops attract two distinct customer segments. The first are what I call “stay-and-savor” customers – people who mostly use the site as a place to meet others or work. Their primary interest is in the space, not the mocha or muffins. The second are “grab-and-go” customers – people who want a consistent product, delivered efficiently. They don’t linger at the store, so the place is less important to them than convenience, speed and product quality. Think of the morning rush at your local coffee joint. Starbucks’ pickup-only stores , branded as Starbucks PICK UP , cater to grab-and-go customers. If you don’t live in a busy area, you might never have heard of the brand: There are fewer than 100 Starbucks PICK UPs, many in densely packed cities. In contrast, there are about 17,000 sit-in Starbucks stores across the United States. That means its plan will affect just 0.5% of its locations. That’s not very much. So why does this change have me a little, well, steamed up? Back to the third place, whether you like it or not As I said before, I see this move as part of an effort to emphasize “stay-and-savor” customers over their “grab-and-go” counterparts. Indeed, Niccol’s recent earnings call presentation claimed that Starbucks is “ prioritizing warmth, connection and community .” Starbucks also publishes a document stating its “ principles for upholding the third place ,” and its commitment seems to be more than just rhetorical. The problem is that coffee shops aren’t like regular restaurants in terms of menu prices and customer spending. “Stay-and-savor” customers are costly to serve for coffee shops, and may generate insufficient revenue, making them less profitable . That could be bad for the bottom line. The change could also have unintended consequences for workers and customers. For example, pickup-only stores allow employees to focus on food and beverage preparation, with less pressure to engage in small talk in the hopes of generating warmth and tips. Indeed, much academic research has shown that restaurant workers who serve customers report more emotional labor and stress and worse morale and well-being than those who don’t. In contrast, Starbucks’ rivals, such as Dunkin’ and the Chinese new entrant Luckin Coffee , have embraced the grab-and-go customers. These rivals provide space for seating space, but they don’t elevate their positioning as if their baristas are serving warmth, connection and community. Starbucks CEO Niccol has described the plan as a “ sunsetting .” I’d watch out for Dunkin’ and Luckin Coffee, and of course, Starbucks’ financials in 2026, to determine whether the Starbucks sun sets or rises.",https://theconversation.com/starbucks-wants-you-to-stay-awhile-but-shuttering-its-mobile-only-pickup-locations-could-be-a-risky-move-262591,Society,BBC,Vivek Astvansh,https://images.theconversation.com/files/692291/original/file-20250922-76-3wrvy7.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&rect=0%2C354%2C3266%2C1633&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop,2025-10-14T12:37:25+00:00,7a03e1dce0813f3a32422e5edb156b299048b599
913eebb72f7c,Industrial facilities owned by profitable companies release more of their toxic waste into the environment,"air pollution, corporations, pollution, toxic chemicals, toxic waste, us environmental protection agency, waste disposal, water pollution","How much pollution a facility engaged in production or resource extraction emits isn’t just based on its location, its industry or the type of work it does. That’s what our team of environmental and financial economists found when we examined how corporate characteristics shape pollution emissions. Pollution emissions rates also vary with specific characteristics of the company that owns the facility – such as how many patents it holds, how profitable it is and how many employees it has, according to an analysis we have conducted of corporate pollution data . We found that industrial and mining facilities owned by profitable companies with relatively few patents and fewer employees tend to release higher proportions of their toxic waste into the environment – into the air, into water or onto soil. By contrast, industrial sites owned by unprofitable companies with higher levels of innovation and more personnel tend to handle higher proportions of their toxic waste in more environmentally responsible ways, such as processing them into nontoxic forms or recycling them, or burning them to generate energy. Corporations publish their pollution data A 1986 federal law requires companies that are in certain industries, employ more than 10 people and make, use or process significant amounts of certain toxic or dangerous chemicals to tell the government where those chemicals go after the company is done with them. That data is collected by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency in a database called the Toxics Release Inventory . That data includes information about the companies, their facilities and locations, and what they do with their waste chemicals. The goal is not only to inform the public about which dangerous chemicals are being used in their communities, but also to encourage companies to use cleaner methods and handle their waste in ways that are more environmentally responsible. Overall, U.S. companies reported releasing to the environment 3.3 billion pounds of toxic chemicals (1.5 billion kg) in 2023, a 21% decrease from 2014 . The decline reflects increased waste management, adoption of pollution prevention and cleaner technologies, in addition to the fact that disclosure requirements motivate companies to reduce releases. The 2023 releases came from over 21,600 industrial facilities in all 50 states and various U.S. territories, including Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, Guam and American Samoa. One-fifth of the facilities reporting toxic releases in 2023 were in Texas, Ohio and California . What kinds of businesses release toxic pollution? Metal mining, chemical manufacturing, primary metals, natural gas processing and electric utilities represent the top five polluting industrial sectors in the U.S. Combined, businesses in those sectors accounted for 78% of the toxic chemicals released in 2023 . Research has found that, often, higher levels of toxic chemical releases come from industrial facilities in less populated, economically disadvantaged, rural or minority communities. But geography and population are not the whole story. Even within the same area, some facilities pollute a lot less than others. Our inquiry into the differences between those facilities has found that corporate characteristics matter a lot – such as operational size, innovative capacity and financial strength. In our analysis, we combined the data companies reported to the EPA about toxic chemical releases with financial information on those companies and ZIP-code level geographic and demographic data. We found that corporate characteristics like profitability, employment size and number of patents are more strongly connected with toxic chemical releases than a community’s population density, minority-group percentage or household income. We looked at what percentage of its toxic chemical waste a facility or mine released to the environment versus how much it treated, recycled or incinerated. The average facility in our sample, which included 1,976 facilities owned by companies for which financial data is available, released about 39% of its toxic chemical waste to the environment, whether to air, water or land – with the remaining 61% of it managed through recycling, treatment or energy recovery either on-site or off-site. But facilities in different industries have different release rates. For example, about 99% of toxic chemicals from coal mines are released to the environment, compared with 81% for natural gas extraction, recovery and processing; 25% for power-generating electric utilities; and less than 3% for electrical equipment manufacturers. The role of innovation One corporate attribute we examined was innovation, which we measured by counting corporations’ patent families , which are groups of patent documents related to the same invention, even if they are filed in different countries. We found that companies with more patent families tend to release less of their toxic waste to the environment. Specifically, facilities owned by the top 25% of companies, when rated by innovation, released an average of 32.5% of their toxic waste to the environment, which is 8 percentage points lower than the average of facilities owned by the remaining companies in the sample. We hypothesize that innovation may give firms a competitive advantage that also enables them to adopt cleaner production technologies or invest in more environmentally conscious methods of handling waste containing toxic chemicals, thereby preventing toxic chemicals from being directly released to the environment. Size and profitability matter, too We also looked at companies’ size – in terms of number of employees – and their profitability, to see how those connected with pollution rates at the facilities the company owns. We found that larger companies, those with more than 19,000 employees, own facilities that release an average of 31% of their toxic chemical waste to the environment. By contrast, facilities owned by midsized companies, from 1,000 to 19,000 workers, release 45%, on average. Those owned by smaller companies, with less than 1,000 employees, release an average of 42% of their toxic chemical waste to the environment. An important note is that those larger companies, which are more likely to have multiple locations, often own facilities that handle larger volumes of chemicals. So even if they release smaller proportions of their toxic waste to the environment, that may still add up to larger quantities. We also found that industrial facilities owned by profitable firms have higher average rates of releasing toxic chemicals to the environment than those owned by unprofitable companies. Facilities owned by companies with positive net income, according to their income statements obtained from PitchBook , a company that collects data on corporations, released an average of 40% of their toxic-chemical-containing wastes to the environment. Facilities owned by companies with negative net income released an average of 31% of their toxic chemical waste to the environment. To us, that indicates that financially strong companies are not necessarily more environmentally responsible. That may be evidence that profitable firms make money in part by contaminating the environment rather than paying for pollution prevention or cleanup. Our analysis shows that geography and demographics alone do not fully account for industries’ and facilities’ differing levels of pollution. Corporate characteristics are also key factors in how toxic waste is handled and disposed of.",https://theconversation.com/industrial-facilities-owned-by-profitable-companies-release-more-of-their-toxic-waste-into-the-environment-265227,Society,BBC,Jennifer Brodmann,https://images.theconversation.com/files/695222/original/file-20251008-64-dvv70r.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&rect=0%2C500%2C6000%2C3000&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop,2025-10-14T12:37:05+00:00,739e06092abd4ff9c2feddd332d4e2832197e392
b2c4b21b9693,Supreme Court redistricting ruling could upend decades of voting rights law – and tilt the balance of power in Washington,"civil rights, racial gerrymandering, redistricting, us supreme court, voting rights act, minority representation","On Oct. 15, 2025, the Supreme Court will hear oral arguments in one of the most anticipated cases of the 2025-2026 term, Louisiana v. Callais , with major implications for the Voting Rights Act, racial representation and Democratic Party power in congress. The central question in the case is to what extent race can, or must, be used when congressional districts are redrawn. Plaintiffs are challenging whether the longstanding interpretation of Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act , which requires protection of minority voting power in redistricting, violates the Equal Protection Clause of the U.S. Constitution , which guarantees that individuals should be treated the same by the law. In short, the plaintiffs argue that the state of Louisiana’s use of race to make a second Black-majority district is forbidden by the U.S. Constitution. This is the second time that the court will hear oral arguments in Louisiana v. Callais after no decision was reached last term . From my perspective as a scholar of U.S. federal courts and electoral systems , this case represents the collision of decades of Supreme Court decisions on race, redistricting and the Voting Rights Act. Long legal battle To understand the stakes of the current case, it’s important to know what the Voting Rights Act does. Initially passed in 1965, the act helped end decades of racially discriminatory voting laws by providing federal enforcement of voting rights. Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act forbids discrimination by states in relation to voting rights and has been used for decades to challenge redistricting plans. The current case has its roots in the redistricting of Louisiana’s congressional districts following the 2020 Census. States are required to redraw districts each decade based on new population data. Louisiana lawmakers redrew the state’s six congressional districts without major changes in 2022. State troopers in Selma, Ala., swing billy clubs on March 7, 1965, to break up a march by advocates for Black Americans’ voting rights. AP Photo, File Soon after the state redistricted, a group of Black voters challenged the map in federal court as a violation of the Voting Rights Act. The plaintiffs argued that the new map was discriminatory because the voting power of Black citizens in the state was being illegally diluted. The state’s population was 31% Black , but only one of the six districts featured a majority-Black population. The federal courts in 2022 sided with the plaintiffs’ claim that the plan did violate the Voting Rights Act and ordered the state legislature to redraw the congressional plan with a second Black-majority district. The judges relied on an interpretation of Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act from a 1986 Supreme Court decision in the case known as Thornburg v. Gingles . Under this interpretation, Section 2’s nondiscrimination requirement means that congressional districts must be drawn in a way that allows large, politically cohesive and compact racial minorities to be able to elect representatives of their choice. In 2023, the Supreme Court upheld a lower court’s interpretation of Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act in a similar racial gerrymandering case in Alabama . Louisiana lawmakers redraw districts Following the court order, the Louisiana state legislature passed Senate Bill 8 in January 2024, redrawing the congressional map and creating two districts where Black voters composed a substantial portion of the electorate in compliance with the Gingles ruling. This map was used in the 2024 congressional election and both Black-majority districts elected Democrats, while the other four districts elected Republicans. These new congressional districts from Senate Bill 8 were challenged by a group of white voters in 2024 in a set of cases that became Louisiana v. Callais . The plaintiffs argued that the Louisiana legislature’s drawing of districts based on race in Senate Bill 8 was in violation of the 14th Amendment’s Equal Protection Clause , which requires equal treatment of individuals by the government, and the 15th Amendment, which forbids denying the right to vote based on race . Essentially, the plaintiffs claimed that the courts’ interpretation of Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act was unconstitutional and that the use of race to create a majority-minority district is itself discriminatory. Similar arguments about the 14th Amendment’s Equal Protection Clause were also the basis of the Supreme Court’s recent decisions striking down race-based affirmative action in college admissions . In 2024, a three-judge district court sided with the white plaintiffs in Louisiana v. Callais, with a 2-1 decision. The Black plaintiffs from the original case , and the state of Louisiana, appealed the case to the Supreme Court . The court originally heard the case at the end of the 2024-2025 term before ordering the case re-argued for 2025-2026. The Louisiana state Capitol in Baton Rouge. AP Photo/Stephen Smith, File High stakes and significant precedent If the Supreme Court ultimately upholds the lower court decision in Louisiana v. Callais, deciding that Louisiana’s congressional districts are unconstitutional racial gerrymanders, it will have substantial impacts on minority representation. The decision would upend decades of precedent for Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act. For 39 years , Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act has required redistricting institutions to consider racial and ethnic minority representation when devising congressional districts. Majority-minority districting is required when a state has large, compact and cohesive minority communities. Historically, some states have redistricted minority communities in ways that dilute their voting power, such as “cracking” a community into multiple districts where they compose a small percentage of the electorate. Section 2 also provides voters and residents with a legal tool that has been used to challenge districts as discriminatory. Many voters and groups have used Section 2 successfully to challenge redistricting plans. Section 2 has been the main legal tool for challenging racial discrimination in redistricting for the past decade. In 2013, the Supreme Court effectively ended the other major component of the Voting Rights Act, the preclearance provision, which required certain states to have changes to their elections laws approved by the federal government , including redistricting. If the court overrules the current interpretation of Section 2, it would limit the legality of using race in redistricting, end requirements for majority-minority districts and eliminate the most common way to challenge discriminatory districting. Additionally, because of the strong relationship between many minority communities and the Democratic party , the court’s decision has major implications for partisan control of the House of Representatives. If Section 2 no longer required majority-minority districts, then Republicans could use the ruling to redraw congressional districts across the country to benefit their party. Politico reported that Democrats could lose as many as 19 House seats if the Supreme Court sides with the lower court. Recent Supreme Court precedent gives conflicting signals as to how it will decide this case. In 2023, the court rejected a challenge to Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act related to Alabama’s congressional districts. In 2024, the court overruled a lower court’s finding of racial vote dilution in South Carolina .",https://theconversation.com/supreme-court-redistricting-ruling-could-upend-decades-of-voting-rights-law-and-tilt-the-balance-of-power-in-washington-267269,Society,BBC,Sam D.

fc036cb66964,"‘Space tornadoes’ could cause geomagnetic storms – but these phenomena, spun off ejections from the Sun, aren’t easy to study","computer simulations, coronal mass ejection, geomagnetic storm, interstellar medium, new research, steehm new research, solar storm, solar wind, space, space weather, sun","Weather forecasting is a powerful tool. During hurricane season, for instance, meteorologists create computer simulations to forecast how these destructive storms form and where they might travel, which helps prevent damage to coastal communities. When you’re trying to forecast space weather, rather than storms on Earth, creating these simulations gets a little more complex . To simulate space weather, you would need to fit the Sun, the planets and the vast empty space between them in a virtual environment, also known as a simulation box, where all the calculations would take place. Space weather is very different from the storms you see on Earth. These events come from the Sun, which ejects eruptions of charged particles and magnetic fields from its surface. The most powerful of these events are called interplanetary coronal mass ejections , or CMEs, which travel at speeds approaching 1,800 miles per second (2,897 kilometers per second). To put that in perspective, a single CME could move a mass of material equivalent to all the Great Lakes from New York City to Los Angeles in just under two seconds – almost faster than it takes to say “space weather.” When these CMEs hit Earth, they can cause geomagnetic storms , which manifest in the sky as beautiful auroras. These storms can also damage key technological infrastructure, such as by interfering with the flow of electricity in the power grid and causing transformers to overheat and fail . Geomagnetic storms, caused by space weather, produce beautiful light shows, but they can also damage satellites. Frank Olsen, Norway/Moment via Getty Images To better understand how these storms can wreak so much havoc , our research team created simulations to show how storms interact with Earth’s natural magnetic shield and trigger the dangerous geomagnetic activity that can shut down electric grids. In a study published in October 2025 in the Astrophysical Journal, we modeled one of the sources of these geomagnetic storms: small, tornado-like vortices spun off of an ejection from the Sun. These vortices are called flux ropes, and satellites had previously observed small flux ropes – but our work helped uncover how they are generated. The challenge Our team started this research in summer 2023, when one of us, a space weather expert , spotted inconsistencies in space weather observations. This work had found geomagnetic storms occurring during periods when no solar eruptions were predicted to hit Earth. Bewildered, the space weather expert wanted to know if there could be space weather events that were smaller than coronal mass ejections and did not originate directly from solar eruptions. He predicted that such events might form in the space between the Sun and Earth, instead of in the Sun’s atmosphere. One example of such smaller space weather events is a magnetic flux rope – bundles of magnetic fields wrapped around each other like a rope. Its detection in computer simulations of solar eruptions would hint to where these space weather events may be forming. Unlike satellite observations, in simulations you can turn back the clock or track an event upstream to see where they originate. Sometimes the Sun ejects masses of plasma and magnetic field lines, called coronal mass ejections. So he asked the other author, a leading simulation expert . It turned out that finding smaller space weather events was not as simple as simulating a big solar eruption and letting the computer model run long enough for the eruption to reach Earth. Current computer simulations are not meant to resolve these smaller events. Instead, they are designed to focus on the large solar eruptions because these have the most effects on infrastructure on Earth. This shortfall was quite disappointing. It was like trying to forecast a hurricane with a simulation that only shows you global weather patterns. Because you can’t see a hurricane at that scale, you would completely miss it. These larger-scale simulations are known as global simulations. They study how solar eruptions form on the Sun’s surface and travel through space. These simulations treat streams of charged particles and magnetic fields floating through space as fluids to reduce the computational cost, compared with modeling every charged particle independently. It’s like measuring the overall temperature of water in a bottle, instead of tracking every single water molecule individually. Because these simulations are computational phenomena that happen across such a vast space, they can’t resolve every detail. To affordably resolve the vast space between the Sun and the planets, researchers divide the space into large cubes – analogous to two-dimensional pixels in a camera. In the simulation, these cubes each represent an area 1 million miles (1.6 million kilometers) wide, tall and across. That distance is equivalent to about 1% of the distance from Earth to the Sun. The search begins Our search began with what felt like hunting for a needle in a haystack. We were looking into old global simulations, searching for a tiny, transient blob – which would signify a flux rope – within an area of space hundreds of times wider than the Sun itself. Our initial search did not yield anything. We then shifted our focus to the simulations of the May 2024 solar eruption event . This time, we specifically looked at the region where the solar eruption collided into a quiet flow of charged particles and magnetic fields, called the solar wind , ahead of it. There it was: a distinct system of magnetic flux ropes . However, our excitement was short-lived. We could not tell where these flux ropes came from. The modeled flux ropes were also too small to survive, eventually fizzling out because they became too small to resolve with our simulation grid. But that was the type of clue we needed – the presence of flux ropes at the location where the solar eruption collided with the solar wind. To settle the issue, we decided to bridge this gap and create a computer model with a finer grid size than those previous global simulations used. Since increasing the resolution across the entire simulation space would have been prohibitively expensive, we decided to only increase the simulation resolution along the trajectory of the flux ropes. The new simulations could now resolve features that spanned distances six times Earth’s 8,000-mile (or 128,000-kilometer) diameter down to tens of thousands of miles – nearly 100 times better than previous simulations. A comparison of low and enhanced simulation grid sizes. We identified one flux rope in the original, low-resolution simulation, but it soon fizzled out. When we improved the simulation grid, we could see multiple flux ropes. CC BY-NC-ND Making the discovery Once we designed and tested the simulation grid, it was time to simulate that same solar eruption that led to the formation of those flux ropes in the less fine-grained model. We wanted to study the formation of those flux ropes and how they grew, changed shape and possibly terminated in the narrow wedge encompassing the space between the Sun and Earth. The results were astonishing. The high-resolution view revealed that the flux ropes formed when the solar eruption slammed into the slower solar wind ahead of it. The new structures possessed incredible complexity and strength that persisted far longer than we expected. In meteorological terms, it was like watching a hurricane spawn a cluster of tornadoes. We found that the magnetic fields in these vortices were strong enough to trigger a significant geomagnetic storm and cause some real trouble here on Earth. But most importantly, the simulations confirmed that there are indeed space weather events that form locally in the space between the Sun and Earth. Our next step is to simulate how such tornado-like features in the solar wind may impact our planet and infrastructure. This two-dimensional cut of the simulation box shows a solar eruption that moves toward Earth quickly. The eruption slams into the slower solar wind ahead of it, causing the formation of a constellation of magnetic flux ropes. The magnetic flux ropes appear as islands in the simulation box. The solid lines represent magnetic field lines, and the color bar shows the number of charged particles. Flux ropes move toward Earth upon formation in the solar wind. The video also shows how the Space Weather Investigation Frontier space mission, or SWIFT, a constellation of four satellites forming a tetrahedron configuration, could examine the formation and growth of these structures in the solar wind. Watching these flux ropes in the simulation form so quickly and move toward Earth was exciting, but concerning. It was exciting because this discovery could help us better plan for future extreme space weather events. It was at the same time concerning because these flux ropes would only appear as a small blip in today’s space weather monitors . We would need multiple satellites to directly see these flux ropes in greater detail so that scientists can more reliably predict whether, when and in what orientation they may affect our planet and what the outcome may be. The good news is that scientists and engineers are developing the next-generation space missions that could address this.",https://theconversation.com/space-tornadoes-could-cause-geomagnetic-storms-but-these-phenomena-spun-off-ejections-from-the-sun-arent-easy-to-study-266567,Society,BBC,Mojtaba Akhavan-Tafti,https://images.theconversation.com/files/695741/original/file-20251011-56-11n5sl.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&rect=0%2C237%2C2200%2C1100&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop,2025-10-13T13:43:52+00:00,44bc58e2eea963fa2f793335b4e08368a70f6d6c
e33617872b27,Far fewer Americans support political violence than recent polls suggest,"artificial intelligence (ai), national guard, political violence, polling, protest, public opinion, trump administration, us politics","A series of recent events has sparked alarm about rising levels of political violence in the U.S. These episodes include the assassination of political activist Charlie Kirk on Sept. 10, 2025; the murder of a Democratic Minnesota state legislator and her husband in June 2025; and two attempts to kill Donald Trump during the 2024 presidential campaign. Some surveys have reported that a large number of Americans are willing to support the use of force for political ends , or they believe that political violence may sometimes be justified . My research is in political science and data analytics . I have  conducted surveys for almost 25 years. For the past three years, I have studied new techniques that leverage artificial intelligence to conduct and analyze interviews. My own recent surveys, which use AI to ask people about why they give their answers, show that the surprisingly high level of support in response to these questions is likely the result of confusion about what these questions are asking, not actual support for political violence. Law enforcement officials lead a procession as pallbearers carry caskets after a funeral ceremony for Minnesota state Rep. Melissa Hortman and her husband, Mark Hortman, on June 28, 2025, in Minneapolis. Stephen Maturen/Getty Images A failure to communicate Why would multiple surveys get the answers to this important question wrong? I believe the cause is an issue called response error. It means that respondents don’t interpret a question in the way the researcher thinks they will. As a result, the answers people provide don’t really reflect what the researcher thinks the answers show. For example, asking whether someone would support the use of force to achieve a political goal raises the question of what the respondent thinks “use of force” means in this context. It could be interpreted as violence, but it could also be interpreted as using legal means to “force” someone to do something. Such response errors have been a concern for pollsters ever since survey research began . They can affect even seemingly straightforward questions. What did you mean by that? To avoid this problem, I used an AI interviewing system developed by CloudResearch , a well-known survey research company, to ask respondents some of the same questions about political violence from previous surveys. Then I used it to ask what they were thinking when they answered those questions. This process is called cognitive interviewing . I then used AI to go through these interviews and categorize them. Two short reports that summarize this process as applied to both polls are available online . These analyses have not been peer-reviewed, and the results should be considered very preliminary. Nonetheless, the results clearly demonstrate that respondents interpret these questions in very different ways. Nuance matters For example, in my survey, about 33% of Democrats agreed with the statement that “use of force is justified to remove President Trump from office.” However, when asked why they agreed, more than 57% gave responses like this: “I was not thinking physically but more in the sense that he – the president – might need to be ‘fired’ or forced out of office due to rules or laws.” Still others were envisioning future scenarios where a president illegally seizes power in a coup. Once you account for these different interpretations of the question, the AI only coded about 8% of Democrats as supporting use of force in violent terms under current conditions. Even here, there was substantial ambiguity – for example, this type of response was not unusual: “The language ‘use of force’ was a bit too broad for me. I could not justify killing Trump, for example, but less extreme uses of force were valid in my eyes.” Similarly, 29% of Republicans agreed that “use of the military is justified to stop protests against President Trump’s agenda.” However, almost all of the respondents who agreed with this statement envisioned the National Guard interceding nonviolently to stop violent protests and riots. Only about 2.6% of Republicans gave comments supporting use of the military against nonviolent protests. Almost all those who agreed that use of the military was justified expressed thoughts like this: “I see the military coming and acting as a police force to stop or prevent the demonstrations that become violent. Peaceful protesters must be allowed to exercise their right to free speech.” People prepare to march in a ‘No Kings’ protest against Trump administration policies in New York City on June 14, 2025. Michael M. Santiago/Getty Images When is political violence justified? Even questions that explicitly ask about political violence are open to wide interpretation. Take, for example, this question: “Do you think it is ever justified for citizens to resort to violence in order to achieve political goals?” The lack of a specific scenario or location in this question invites respondents to engage in all kinds of philosophical and historical speculation. In my survey, almost 15% of respondents said violence could sometimes be justified. When asked about the examples they were thinking of, respondents cited the American Revolution, the anti-Nazi French Resistance and many other incidents as a reason for their responses. Only about 3% of respondents said they were thinking about actions in the U.S. at the current time. Moreover, almost all respondents stated that violence should be a last resort when all other peaceful and legal methods fail. One respondent illustrated both problems with one sentence: “The (American) colonists tried petitions and negotiations first, but, when those efforts failed, they resorted to armed conflict to gain independence.” A call for understanding Even these numbers likely overestimate Americans’ support for political violence. I read the interviews, checking the AI system’s labeling, and concluded that, if anything, it was overestimating support for violence. Other factors may also be distorting reports of public support for political violence. Many surveys are conducted primarily online. One study estimated that anywhere from 4% to 7% of respondents in online surveys are “ bogus respondents ” who are selecting arbitrary responses. Another study reported that such respondents dramatically increase positive responses on questions about political violence. Respondents may also be willing to espouse attitudes anonymously online that they would never say or do in real life. Studies have suggested that “ online disinhibition effects ” or “ survey trolling ” can impact survey results. In sum, my preliminary research suggests that response error is a substantial problem in surveys about political violence. Americans almost universally condemn the recent political violence they have witnessed. The recent poll results showing otherwise more likely stem from confusion about what the questions are asking than actual support for political violence.",https://theconversation.com/far-fewer-americans-support-political-violence-than-recent-polls-suggest-266113,Society,BBC,Ryan Kennedy,https://images.theconversation.com/files/695510/original/file-20251009-66-bdh2nw.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&rect=0%2C45%2C5141%2C2570&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop,2025-10-13T12:38:15+00:00,a6b9594fc817b3ae679b6f0eb6e819316a3fdecd

Years ago, one of us was in the Bahamas chasing a typically uncooperative lizard across dense and narrow branches, frustrated that its nimble agility was thwarting efforts to catch it. Only when finally captured did we discover this wily brown anole was missing its entire left hind leg . This astonishing observation set our research down an unexpected path. That chance encounter led us to collaborate with over 60 colleagues worldwide to document what we suspected might be a broader phenomenon. Our research uncovered 122 cases of limb loss across 58 lizard species and revealed that these “three-legged pirates” – the rare survivors of traumatic injuries – can run just as fast, maintain healthy body weight, reproduce successfully and live surprisingly long lives. To be clear, most lizards probably do not survive such devastating injuries. What we’re documenting are the exceptional cases that defy our expectations about how natural selection works. A four-horned chameleon missing its entire left forelimb in Cameroon appeared healthy when observed in the wild, despite the specialized gripping requirements of chameleons. Christopher Anderson This discovery is startling because lizard limbs represent one of biology’s most studied examples of evolutionary adaptation. For decades, scientists have demonstrated that even tiny differences in leg length between individual lizards can mean the difference between life and death – affecting their ability to escape predators, catch prey and find mates. Since subtle variations matter so much, biologists have long assumed that losing an entire limb should be catastrophic. Yet our global survey tells a different story about these remarkable survivors. Working with colleagues across six continents, we found limb-damaged lizards across nearly all major lizard families, from tiny geckos to massive iguanas. These animals had clearly healed from whatever trauma caused their injuries – likely accidents or the failed attempts of a predator to eat them. Perhaps most remarkably, we documented surviving limb loss even in chameleons, tree-climbing specialists whose movements seem to require perfect limb coordination. Thriving, not just surviving The body condition of these lizards was most surprising. Rather than appearing malnourished, many limb-damaged lizards were actually heavier than expected for their size, suggesting they were successfully finding food despite their handicap. Some were actively reproducing, with females found carrying eggs and males observed successfully mating. Limb damage can be fairly common in some lizard populations, such as these X-rays of brown anoles ( Anolis sagrei ) from the Bahamas. Jason Kolbe/Jonathan Losos These findings force us to reconsider some basic assumptions about how evolution might work in wild populations. Charles Darwin envisioned natural selection as an omnipresent force, “ daily and hourly scrutinizing ” every feature. But perhaps selection is more episodic than constant. Maybe sometimes limb length matters tremendously, while during other times – such as when food is abundant and predators are scarce – limb length matters less and three-legged lizards can flourish. These lizard survivors showcase the incredible solutions that millions of years of evolution have built into their biology. Rather than being passive victims of their injuries, these lizards may survive by actively choosing safer habitats or hunting strategies, using smart behavior to avoid situations where their disability would be a disadvantage. Biological engineering in action Our research combines old-fashioned natural history observations with cutting-edge, biomechanical analysis . We use high-speed cameras and computer software that can track movement frame by frame to analyze running mechanics invisible to the naked eye. This combination of field biology and laboratory precision allows us to understand not just that these lizards survive, but how they accomplish this remarkable feat. When we tested the three-legged lizards’ athletic performance, the results defied expectations. Some animals were clearly impaired in their sprinting capabilities, but others actually ran faster than fully-limbed individuals of the same size across a 2-meter dash during our “Lizard Olympics .” Researchers used computer software that automatically tracks movement patterns to analyze high-speed videos of lizards sprinting, such as this brown anole missing half of its right back leg. Christopher Anderson High-speed video analysis revealed their secret: The speedy survivors compensate through creative biomechanical solutions. One brown anole missing half its hind limb dramatically increased its body undulation during sprinting, using exaggerated snakelike movements to compensate for the missing leg. By documenting the unexpected – the seemingly impossible survivors – we’re reminded that nature still holds surprises that can fundamentally change how we think about life itself.",https://theconversation.com/3-legged-lizards-can-thrive-against-all-odds-challenging-assumptions-about-how-evolution-works-in-the-wild-262467,Society,BBC,James T.

dbf0465e38d0,Why are elements like radium dangerous? A chemist explains radioactivity and its health effects,"chemistry, curious kids, curious kids us, decay, isotopes, radiation, radioactivity, radium","Curious Kids is a series for children of all ages. If you have a question you’d like an expert to answer, send it to CuriousKidsUS@theconversation.com . “What is radium and why is it dangerous?” – Aurora, 10, Laredo, Texas The element radium can be found in extremely tiny amounts in the Earth’s crust and oceans, and in its pure form it is a soft silvery metal. To an untrained eye, a small piece of radium may look like a chip off a regular gray rock. But radium can invisibly emit radiation – energy and small fragments of itself – that you can’t feel, see or smell. And that invisible radiation can hurt you, without you even noticing right away. What’s going on with this silent threat that can stealthily damage your body in ways that can take years to reveal themselves? As a chemist , I’m interested in what makes different elements safe to handle or hazardous. This dangerous release of radiation is called radioactivity, and even though its source may look unassuming, it can burn you or even give you diseases that don’t manifest for years. Atoms and isotopes Everything you see around you – your skin, rocks, the pages of books – is all made up of different combinations of extremely small particles called atoms . An atom has a small, dense center called the nucleus. Negatively charged particles called electrons move around the nucleus. Inside the nucleus, there are two types of particles: positively charged protons and neutral neutrons. All atoms with the same number of protons in their nuclei are the same element . Besides radium, some elements you may have heard of are carbon and oxygen. All carbon atoms have six protons and all oxygen atoms have eight protons. Radium atoms are much heavier – all radium atoms have 88 protons. A simplified model of an atom, where the nucleus, containing neutrons and positively charged protons, sits in the center surrounded by negatively charged electrons. CNX OpenStax/Wikimedia Commons , CC BY Interestingly, it is possible for atoms of the same element to have different numbers of neutrons. Atoms of the same element with different numbers of neutrons are called isotopes. For instance, two carbon atoms would each have six protons, but one might have six neutrons while another could have seven or eight. The number of protons and neutrons packed together in the nucleus determines whether the nucleus of an isotope is stable or not. If the nucleus is not stable, problems can arise. Radioactive decay The nucleus of each atom wants to be stable, but only certain arrangements of protons and neutrons make that possible . The number of protons and neutrons do not have to be equal, but some combinations make for a happy, or stable, coexistence in the nucleus while others don’t. A nucleus with an unhappy mix of protons and neutrons might break down or deteriorate in some way. That process is called radioactivity or radioactive decay . Elements are radioactive if they decay by releasing parts of the nucleus or high-energy particles. Armtuk/Wikimedia Commons , CC BY That radioactive decay process releases some form of radiation from the nucleus . This radiation can take the form of tiny particles moving rapidly or high-energy electromagnetic waves emerging from the nucleus. It is that radiation – the high-energy particles and waves shooting out from the nucleus of unstable atomic nuclei – that can make you sick. There are different types of radioactive decay . In one case, an atom decays by kicking out a small fragment of itself that is made up of two protons and two neutrons. Since the number of protons determines what element we have, decay that changes the number of protons in an atom turns it into a different element. Radioactive decay can be quite slow, though. It can take thousands of years for one element to decay into a different one. The case of radium All radium atoms are unstable and radioactive. Many of these isotopes decay very quickly, but Ra-226, which has 138 neutrons and 88 protons and is the most common, decays the slowest . It takes 1,600 years for half a sample of Ra-226 to decay. Radium undergoes alpha decay, where it loses a fragment of its nucleus containing two protons and two neutrons, after which it becomes radon. MikeRun/Wikimedia Commons , CC BY-SA As Ra-226 decays, it loses two protons and two neutrons, which turns it into an isotope of radon . Then the radon decays, and the atom eventually reaches a stable form as the element lead. Each step in that decay series releases more nuclear radiation. Some other elements in nature with no stable isotope are technetium, polonium, actinium and uranium. Effects on the human body The nuclear radiation emitted when radium and other elements decay can damage the cells in the human body. It can lead to cancers or other health problems . Marie and Pierre Curie experimented with radium, which ended up causing health complications for them. André Castaigne Whether you’re exposed to a lot of radiation quickly, like making the mistake of walking around for a few hours with radioactive material in your pocket , or you’re exposed to just a little over a long time , the high-energy particles and electromagnetic waves from nuclear radiation can lead to serious health problems , including burns and cancers . Remarkably, even though radioactivity is a threat to life, scientists can control and use it to diagnose and treat diseases – including cancers . If the radiation is delivered precisely to where cancer cells are, the radiation can destroy those rogue cells wreaking havoc in the body. People who work professionally with radioactive materials need to follow strict guidelines and procedures to protect themselves. They use special shields and radiation detectors, and they minimize the amount of time they’re exposed to any radioactivity. Pierre and Marie Curie, who discovered radium in 1898, suffered some of the negative effects of radioactivity. Pierre experienced radioactive burns , and Marie died from a blood disease likely caused by chronic radiation exposure . Over 100 years later, her notebooks are still radioactive .

4d97e3448b19,"What are climate tipping points? They sound scary, especially for ice sheets and oceans, but there’s still room for optimism","amoc, amazon, antarctica, brazil, climate change, coral reefs, corals, east antarctic ice sheet, environment, greenland, greenland ice sheet, ice sheets, oceans, tipping points","As the planet warms, it risks crossing catastrophic tipping points: thresholds where Earth systems, such as ice sheets and rain forests, change irreversibly over human lifetimes. Scientists have long warned that if global temperatures warmed more than 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 Fahrenheit) compared with before the Industrial Revolution, and stayed high, they would increase the risk of passing multiple tipping points . For each of these elements, like the Amazon rain forest or the Greenland ice sheet, hotter temperatures lead to melting ice or drier forests that leave the system more vulnerable to further changes. Worse, these systems can interact. Freshwater melting from the Greenland ice sheet can weaken ocean currents in the North Atlantic , disrupting air and ocean temperature patterns and marine food chains . Pink circles show the systems closest to tipping points. Some would have regional effects, such as loss of coral reefs. Others are global, such as the beginning of the collapse of the Greenland ice sheet. Global Tipping Points Report , CC BY-ND With these warnings in mind, 194 countries a decade ago set 1.5 C as a goal they would try not to cross. Yet in 2024, the planet temporarily breached that threshold . The term “tipping point” is often used to illustrate these problems, but apocalyptic messages can leave people feeling helpless, wondering if it’s pointless to slam the brakes. As a geoscientist who has studied the ocean and climate for over a decade and recently spent a year on Capitol Hill working on bipartisan climate policy , I still see room for optimism. It helps to understand what a tipping point is – and what’s known about when each might be reached. Tipping points are not precise A tipping point is a metaphor for runaway change. Small changes can push a system out of balance. Once past a threshold, the changes reinforce themselves, amplifying until the system transforms into something new. Almost as soon as “tipping points” entered the climate science lexicon — following Malcolm Gladwell’s 2000 book, “The Tipping Point: How Little Things Can Make a Big Difference” — scientists warned the public not to confuse global warming policy benchmarks with precise thresholds . The Greenland ice sheet, which is 1.9 miles (3 kilometers) thick at its thickest point, has been losing mass for several years as temperatures rise and more of its ice is lost to the ocean. A tipping point would mean runaway ice loss, with the potential to eventually raise sea level 24 feet (7.4 meters) and shut down a crucial ocean circulation. Sean Gallup/Getty Images The scientific reality of tipping points is more complicated than crossing a temperature line. Instead, different elements in the climate system have risks of tipping that increase with each fraction of a degree of warming. For example, the beginning of a slow collapse of the Greenland ice sheet, which could raise global sea level by about 24 feet (7.4 meters), is one of the most likely tipping elements in a world more than 1.5 C warmer than preindustrial times. Some models place the critical threshold at 1.6 C (2.9 F). More recent simulations estimate runaway conditions at 2.7 C (4.9 F) of warming. Both simulations consider when summer melt will outpace winter snow, but predicting the future is not an exact science. Gradients show science-based estimates from the Global Tipping Points Report of when some key global or regional climate tipping points are increasingly likely to be reached. Every fraction of a degree increases the likeliness, reflected in the warming color. Global Tipping Points Report 2025 , CC BY-ND Forecasts like these are generated using powerful climate models that simulate how air, oceans, land and ice interact. These virtual laboratories allow scientists to run experiments, increasing the temperature bit by bit to see when each element might tip. Climate scientist Timothy Lenton first identified climate tipping points in 2008 . In 2022, he and his team revisited temperature collapse ranges , integrating over a decade of additional data and more sophisticated computer models. Their nine core tipping elements include large-scale components of Earth’s climate, such as ice sheets, rain forests and ocean currents. They also simulated thresholds for smaller tipping elements that pack a large punch, including die-offs of coral reefs and widespread thawing of permafrost . The world may have already passed one tipping point, according to the 2025 Global Tipping Points Report: Corals reefs are dying as marine temperatures rise. Healthy reefs are essential fish nurseries and habitat and also help protect coastlines from storm erosion. Once they die, their structures begin to disintegrate. Vardhan Patankar/Wikimedia Commons , CC BY-SA Some tipping elements, such as the East Antarctic ice sheet, aren’t in immediate danger . The ice sheet’s stability is due to its massive size – nearly six times that of the Greenland ice sheet – making it much harder to push out of equilibrium. Model results vary, but they generally place its tipping threshold between 5 C (9 F) and 10 C (18 F) of warming. Other elements, however, are closer to the edge. Alarm bells sounding in forests and oceans In the Amazon, self-perpetuating feedback loops threaten the stability of the Earth’s largest rain forest, an ecosystem that influences global climate . As temperatures rise, drought and wildfire activity increase, killing trees and releasing more carbon into the atmosphere, which in turn makes the forest hotter and drier still. By 2050, scientists warn, nearly half of the Amazon rain forest could face multiple stressors . That pressure may trigger a tipping point with mass tree die-offs. The once-damp rain forest canopy could shift to a dry savanna for at least several centuries. Rising temperatures also threaten biodiversity underwater. The second Global Tipping Points Report , released Oct. 12, 2025, by a team of 160 scientists including Lenton, suggests tropical reefs may have passed a tipping point that will wipe out all but isolated patches. Coral loss on the Great Barrier Reef. Australian Institute of Marine Science. Corals rely on algae called zooxanthellae to thrive. Under heat stress, the algae leave their coral homes, draining reefs of nutrition and color. These mass bleaching events can kill corals, stripping the ecosystem of vital biodiversity that millions of people rely on for food and tourism. Low-latitude reefs have the highest risk of tipping, with the upper threshold at just 1.5 C, the report found. Above this amount of warming, there is a 99% chance that these coral reefs tip past their breaking point. Similar alarms are ringing for ocean currents, where freshwater ice melt is slowing down a major marine highway that circulates heat, known as the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation, or AMOC. How the Atlantic Ocean circulation would change as it slows. IPCC 6th Assessment Report The AMOC carries warm water northward from the tropics. In the North Atlantic, as sea ice forms, the surface gets colder and saltier, and this dense water sinks. The sinking action drives the return flow of cold, salty water southward, completing the circulation’s loop. But melting land ice from Greenland threatens the density-driven motor of this ocean conveyor belt by dilution: Fresher water doesn’t sink as easily. A weaker current could create a feedback loop, slowing the circulation further and leading to a shutdown within a century once it begins, according to one estimate. Like a domino, the climate changes that would accompany an AMOC collapse could worsen drought in the Amazon and accelerate ice loss in the Antarctic . Questions about closeness of other tipping points Not all scientists agree that an AMOC or rain forest collapse is close. In the Amazon, researchers recognize the forest’s changes, but some have questioned whether some of the modeled vegetation data that underpins tipping point concerns is accurate . In the North Atlantic, there are similar concerns about data showing a long-term trend . The Amazon forest has been losing tree cover to logging, farming, ranching, wildfires and a changing climate. Pink shows areas with greater than 75% tree canopy loss from 2001 to 2024. Blue is tree cover gain from 2000 to 2020. Global Forest Watch , CC BY Other changes driven by rising global temperatures, like melting permafrost , could be reversed. Permafrost, for example, could refreeze if temperatures drop again. Risks are too high to ignore Despite the uncertainty, tipping points are too risky to ignore . Rising temperatures put people and economies around the world at greater risk of dangerous conditions. But there is still room for preventive actions – every fraction of a degree in warming that humans prevent reduces the risk of runaway climate conditions. Reducing greenhouse gas emissions slows warming and tipping point risks. Tipping points highlight the stakes, but they also underscore the climate choices humanity can still make to stop the damage.

7a7202ae7ac3,How the government shutdown is making the air traffic controller shortage worse and leading to flight delays,"air travel, air travel safety, essential workers, federal aviation administration, labor rights, organized labor, us government shutdown, us shutdown, air traffic controllers","Airports across the United States have been experiencing significant flight delays recently because of a shortage of air traffic controllers, who have been required to work without pay since a government shutdown began on Oct. 1, 2025. Reports suggest employees have been calling in sick in increased numbers. And since there was already a shortage of controllers before the shutdown, the impact has been severe, with thousands of flights delayed or canceled since the shutdown began. The Conversation U.S. asked Brian Strzempkowski and Melanie Dickman , aviation experts at The Ohio State University, to explain how the shutdown is affecting air travel, what that means for passengers and air safety, as well as the air traffic controller shortage that has been plaguing U.S. airports for years. How is the shutdown affecting air traffic controllers? Air traffic controllers are deemed essential workers, meaning they are still required to work while not receiving compensation – which they would typically then receive in a lump sum after the shutdown ends. President Donald Trump created some uncertainty around this by suggesting workers may not get their back pay without explicit authorization from Congress, despite having signed a law in his first term that makes it a legal requirement. Working without regular pay, combined with the possibility that they won’t get paid at all, is resulting in real financial stress for air traffic controllers, who perform one of the most stressful jobs there is . As a result, there have been reports of air traffic controllers calling in sick in large numbers. This happened in previous shutdowns as well. During the 2018-2019 shutdown , for example, sickouts started to happen around the two-week mark, roughly when the first paycheck was missed. Controllers, airport security employees, and other essential workers were calling in sick often so they could work another part-time job to pay their bills. In the current shutdown, this appears to be happening sooner, less than a week after it began. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said around 10% of the controller workforce is engaging in this practice and threatened to fire these “problem children .” What does this mean for people about to take a flight? Before the shutdown, there was already a critical shortage of air traffic controllers. Coupled with workers calling in sick in recent days, this has led to severe travel delays at many major airports, such as those in Atlanta and Denver, and regional ones, like those serving Burbank, California, and Daytona Beach, Florida. A big question on travelers’ minds is whether this will affect air safety. The air traffic control system is multi-layered and has redundancies built into it to ensure an incredibly safe environment. While controller shortages do begin to erode some of those redundancies, contingency plans are in place to help protect the system. For example, air traffic can be diverted away from affected locations or delayed, or the flight may even be be canceled before the plane leaves the gate. As an example, Newark Liberty International Airport can accommodate approximately 80 aircraft departing or arriving per hour when the airport and airspace is fully operational. However, due to technical failures, staffing shortages and construction at the airport, capacity was limited to between 28 and 34 aircraft per hour in June 2025. Due to technology upgrades and procedural changes, that number was recently increased to between 68 and 72 aircraft per hour. By regulating the amount of traffic, the system can be protected to ensure the safety of every aircraft. This was an example of high-level oversight in which the secretary of transportation was personally involved in seeking a solution to ensure air travel remained safe while trying to increase capacity. Air traffic controllers have one of the most stressful jobs. AP Photo/Charles Rex Arbogast How does the US keep air travel safe? On a more day-to-day level, the Federal Aviation Administration relies on the Air Traffic Control System Command Center , located about 40 miles away from Washington, D.C. This facility oversees the entire national airspace system and essentially “controls” the controllers. Air traffic professionals monitor staffing at air traffic facilities, weather conditions, equipment failures and unexpected disruptions to the system. When an incident arises, such as Burbank Airport recently reporting that no controllers were available , the command center issues an alert stating that any aircraft inbound to Burbank must divert to an alternate airport, and any aircraft that has not yet taken off will be held on the ground. Staffing shortages at other air traffic control facilities may require alternate plans, such as transitioning workloads from one facility with fewer controllers, to another that is appropriately staffed. There is a wide range of tools that the Air Traffic Control System Command Center can utilize to protect the system, but it all stems from the idea of managing the capacity. Flight delays and cancellations, while disruptive to individual travelers, are actually good from a system perspective, because they prevent congestion in the airspace. Why was there an air traffic controller shortage in the first place? There has been a systemic problem with hiring of air traffic controllers for more than a decade. Over the years, the FAA has fallen behind on training enough controllers to replace those who retire each year. In May 2025, we wrote about the FAA’s plan to utilize colleges across the country to provide the professional training for this career field. While it will take a little time for the students to matriculate through college and into the workforce, this plan will be a significant contributor to solving the controller shortage problem. Meanwhile, the FAA Academy, which trains U.S. air traffic controllers, only has limited funding from the previous federal budget for current students. The shutdown means no new students can begin training. Depending on the length of the shutdown, the funding may run out as additional employees are furloughed. The ripple effects of a shutdown can remain for many months after the government reopens. What’s the government doing to end the shortage? In July, Congress authorized over US$12 billion in funding to help modernize the air traffic control system. Secretary Duffy is currently leading an effort to identify a contractor to implement the technology upgrades needed to modernize the system and make it more robust. Duffy has said an additional $19 billion investment will be needed to complete the task. The editor’s note was updated to correct the number of flights canceled during the shutdown.",https://theconversation.com/how-the-government-shutdown-is-making-the-air-traffic-controller-shortage-worse-and-leading-to-flight-delays-267093,Society,BBC,Brian Strzempkowski,https://images.theconversation.com/files/695700/original/file-20251010-56-omtyeq.jpeg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&rect=0%2C0%2C6434%2C3217&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop,2025-10-11T10:34:23+00:00,bdde474c1a8d829722ec605096b6f53bf4180300

Roughly the size of the state of Connecticut, the freshwater Okavango Delta opens into an enormous alluvial fan that stretches up to 5,800 square miles (15,000 square km) into the Kalahari Desert. The area is so vast it can be seen from space, but most people have never heard of it. In recognition of its natural and cultural significance, the Okavango Delta was designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2014. When I conducted research in the Okavango in 2024, I witnessed both its natural beauty and the ebullient warmth of the people who live there. The health of the delta – and of 270 other natural sites across the globe – is the subject of the latest IUCN World Heritage Outlook , a recurring wellness report on the planet’s most treasured natural places. The report’s findings are not dire, but they aren’t great, either. Many of these extraordinary places are increasingly at risk due to escalating climate change, invasive species, and a lack of consistent funding to protect them. The outlook Every few years, the International Union for Conservation of Nature – a global contingent of more than 1,400 government agencies and private organizations focused on environmental conservation – evaluates the environmental and biological conditions at all UNESCO World Heritage sites selected for their natural significance. That includes the Okavango Delta in Botswana , home to the world’s largest population of African elephants; the Central Amazon Conservation Complex in Brazil ; the Socotra Archipelago in Yemen with hundreds of species of birds and fish; the Tropical Rainforest Heritage of Sumatra, Indonesia ; the Central Amazon Conservation Complex in Brazil , and Everglades National Park, Florida . The IUCN reports to UNESCO on each site’s current state and natural value , the threats it faces, the effectiveness of its protection and management, and actions needed to secure its future. The IUCN rates each site’s status from “good” to “critical” as a way of tracking its conservation progress over time. The most recent report – the fourth in a series that began in 2014 – was presented at the IUCN World Conservation Congress on Oct. 11, 2025. Overall, the report documents a decline in the conditions of these remarkable places . The proportion of World Heritage sites with a positive conservation outlook – “good” or “good with some concerns” – has dropped to 57% after remaining at 63% in 2014, 2017 and 2020 . In addition, the proportion of sites considered of “significant concern” or “critical” has increased in the last five years from 37% to 43%. Many of those are in Mesoamerica, Africa and South America, as well as the Middle East, North Africa and the Mediterranean.

The most widespread conservation challenge the report identifies is climate change. Climate-related changes in biological conditions such as ocean acidity, salt concentrations, sediment buildup, droughts, flooding and groundwater flow, and variable temperatures are considered “high” or “very high” threats to 117 of the 271 heritage sites evaluated – 43% of them. One-third of the 50 World Heritage sites that contain glaciers will see those glaciers disappear by 2050, the report projects. Around the world, coral reefs have been, and are still, bleaching – turning white as the colorful organisms that build and inhabit them die off – affecting 30% of the 29 World Heritage-listed coral reef ecosystems. In addition, invasive species are encroaching on World Heritage sites. For example, in Ecuador’s Galápagos Islands, invasive species like rats and feral cats are considered one of the main causes of extinctions, including to the islands’ famous birds. In Australia’s Gondwana Rainforest, the last vestiges of an ancient plant and animal “ living museum ” are retreating due to invading non-native species.

Romina Cruz/picture alliance via Getty Images Threats from people Additional human pressures are also endangering these unique areas. Threats to these sites from the outside include logging and mining in the region, developing nearby land, diverting natural water flows, and polluting the air, water and land. Roughly two-thirds of the sites studied face at least some danger from human activities happening outside the sites’ formal boundaries. In addition, the report says heritage sites need more financial support to be better able to respond to key threats. It finds that most lack consistent, long-term funding for staff salaries, ecosystem monitoring, and continued maintenance of protection programs . Chronic underfunding is the primary barrier to effective ecosystem management. Funding typically comes from organizations such as the World Heritage Fund or the Global Environment Facility , an organization made up of 186 member countries, institutions, nongovernmental organizations, and the private sector that funds environmental projects worldwide. The IUCN report warns that even effective initiatives may struggle in the long term without stronger regional, national and global support. That could include efforts like the Okavango’s Community Management for Protected Areas Conservation program, which connects rural communities and conservationists to support both people and nature.

There is good news, though. Targeted local action, such as anti-poaching efforts and local community involvement, have improved conditions at four sites in West and Central Africa, shifting their status from “critical” to “significant concern.” There is more to know about these sites and how they are faring. As a community-based conservation scholar, I recognize that while the major drivers of ecological decline can be gleaned from published research, specific causes of that decline are best learned on the ground. The outlook provides critical environmental trends, but it could be strengthened by including specifics based on quantitative, community-based monitoring, such as wildlife population surveys by local experts. For instance, at a conference I attended in 2024, a frog biologist from Botswana observed that, before her work, the previous frog study in that part of the delta was in 1980. While critical local and Indigenous knowledge is recognized in the report, it is largely excluded from assessments, both because weaving it with conventional scientific analysis is difficult or because communities may choose to protect certain knowledge. The Okavango Delta is one of many World Heritage sites, living landscapes rich with local cultural value and global significance. Like many remote heritage sites outside Europe and North America , there is a lot that remains unknown about biodiversity in the Okavango. The report acknowledges that recognizing the relationship between people and the environment would also improve future assessments. Overall, it offers a clear picture of global conservation trends while also acknowledging local realities and successes: for the heritage sites across the planet, conservation succeeds when people and nature thrive together.",https://theconversation.com/natural-world-heritage-sites-under-growing-threat-but-bright-spots-remain-266548,Society,BBC,Jessica Beaudette,https://images.theconversation.com/files/695704/original/file-20251010-56-y1hr8r.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&rect=0%2C691%2C4548%2C2274&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop,2025-10-11T10:32:09+00:00,91a09ed47f507e4749dfe2b5501502bd8ff8b01d
defcf35cd503,María Corina Machado’s peace prize follows Nobel tradition of awarding recipients for complex reasons,"democracy, latin america, maría corina machado, nicolás maduro, nobel peace prize, trump administration, venezuela, venezuelan opposition","Few can doubt the courage María Corina Machado has shown in fighting for a return to democracy in Venezuela. The 58-year-old politician and activist is the undisputed leader of the opposition to Nicolás Maduro – a man widely seen as a dictator who has taken Venezuela down the path of repression, human rights violations and increasing poverty since becoming president in 2013. Maduro is widely believed to have lost the 2024 presidential election to rival Edmundo González , a candidate substituting Machado, yet still claimed victory. Machado has been in hiding since the fraudulent vote . And her courage in having participated in an unfair contest and in exposing Maduro’s fraud by publishing the true vote tallies on the internet, surely made Machado stand out to the Nobel committee. Indeed, in making Machado the 2025 recipient of the Nobel Peace Prize , organizers stated they were recognizing her “tireless work promoting democratic rights for the people of Venezuela and for her struggle to achieve a just and peaceful transition from dictatorship to democracy.” But as a scholar of Venezuela’s political process , I know that is only part of the story. Machado is in many ways a controversial pick, less a peace activist than a political operator willing to use some of the trade’s dark arts for the greater democratic good. Joining a controversial list of laureates Of course, many Nobel Peace Prize awards generate controversy . It has often been bestowed on great politicians over activists. And sometimes the prize’s winners can have complex pasts and very non-peaceful resumes. Past recipients include Henry Kissinger, who as U.S. secretary of state and Richard Nixon’s security adviser was responsible for the illegal bombing of Cambodia , supporting Indonesia’s brutal invasion of East Timor and propping up dictators in Latin America, among many other morally dubious actions. Similarly, former Palestinian Liberation Organization leader Yasser Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin were both awarded the prize, in 1994 and 1978 respectively, despite their past association with violent activities in the Middle East. Yasser Arafat, Henry Kissinger and Yitzhak Rabin – all Nobel Peace Prize laureates. Duclos/Merillon/Gamma-Rapho via Getty Images The Nobel Committee often seems to use these awards not to celebrate past achievements but to affect the future course of events. The nods to Begin and Arafat were, in this way, used for encouragement of the Middle East peace process. In fact, sometimes, the peace prize is seemingly bestowed as a sign of approval for a break from the past. Barack Obama won his in 2009 despite only being nine months into his presidency. It was taken by many as a rejection of the previous presidency of George W. Bush, rather than recognition of Obama’s limited achievements at that time. In 2016, Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize just days after his peace plan was rejected in a referendum. In that instance, the committee seemed to want to give his efforts a push just after a major setback. Democratic path or dark arts? So what should be made of the Nobel Peace Prize committee’s decision to recognize opposition to Maduro now? Certainly Machado’s profile is ascendant. In her political career, she has participated in elections – winning a seat in the National Assembly in 2010 – but boycotted many more. She also boycotted negotiation processes, suggesting instead that foreign intervention was the only way to remove Maduro. In 2023 she returned to the electoral path and steadfastly mobilized the Venezuelan population for opposition primaries and presidential elections, even after her candidacy was disqualified by the government-controlled electoral authority, and innumerable other obstacles were put in her path. The campaign included spearheading caravans and events across the country at significant personal risk. However, much of her fight since then has been via less-democratic means. Machado has shunned local and regional elections suggesting there was no sense in participating until the government honored the results of the 2024 presidential election. She has also again sought international intervention to remove Maduro. Over the past year she has aggressively promoted the discredited theory that Maduro is in control of the Tren de Aragua gang and is using it to invade the United States – a narrative gladly accepted and repurposed by U.S. President Donald Trump. In addition to being the expressed motivation for a U.S. military buildup off the coasts of Venezuela, this theory has also been the central justification cited by the Trump administration for using the Alien Enemies Act to deport, without due process, 238 Venezuelan men to a horrific prison in El Salvador. Nicolas Maduro continues to loom large and rule Venezuela despite María Corina Machado’s efforts. Jesus Vargas/Getty Images Relations with Trump The Nobel Peace Prize could help unify the Venezuelan opposition movement, which over the past year has begun to fray over differences in strategy , especially with respect to Machado’s return to electoral boycotts. And it will certainly draw more international attention to Venezuelans’ struggle for democracy and could galvanize international stakeholders to push for change. What it will mean in terms of Trump’s relationship to Machado and Venezuela is yet to be seen. Her main connection with the administration is through Secretary of State Marco Rubio , who has aggressively represented her views and is pushing for U.S. military intervention to depose Maduro Awarding Machado the prize could strengthen Trump’s resolve to seek regime change in Venezuela. Or, if he feels snubbed by the Nobel committee after very vocally lobbying to be awarded the peace prize himself, it could be a wedge between the U.S. president and Machado. Machado seems to understand this. After not mentioning him in her first statement after the award was announced, she has since mentioned him multiple times, even dedicating the prize to both the Venezuelan people and Trump . Trump has subsequently called to congratulate her . A game changer? Perhaps not To the degree that the Nobel Peace Prize is not just a model of change but a model for change, the decision to award it to Machado could conceivably affect the nature of Venezuela’s struggle against authoritarianism, leading her to continue to seek the restoration of democracy with a greater focus on reconciliation and coexistence among all Venezuelans, including the still politically relevant followers of the late Hugo Chávez. Whatever the impact, it probably will not be game-changing. As we have seen with other winners, the initial glow of public recognition is quickly consumed by political conflict. And in Venezuela, there is no easy way to translate this prize into real democratic progress. While Machado and other Venezuelan democrats may have more support than ever among global democrats, Nicolás Maduro controls all of Venezuela’s institutions including the armed forces and the state oil company, which, even when sanctioned, provides substantial resources. Maduro also has forged strategic alliances with China, Russia and Iran . The only way one can imagine the restoration of democracy in Venezuela, with or without military action, is through an extensive process of negotiation, reconciliation, disarmament and justice that could lay the groundwork for coexistence. This Nobel Peace Prize could position Machado for this task.",https://theconversation.com/maria-corina-machados-peace-prize-follows-nobel-tradition-of-awarding-recipients-for-complex-reasons-267268,Society,BBC,David Smilde,https://images.theconversation.com/files/695712/original/file-20251010-56-rnf2wt.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&rect=0%2C87%2C3665%2C1832&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop,2025-10-10T22:53:41+00:00,f747a5c0e0562bee3bfcb0d0ec1979e5261bcb71
6071ed47f256,From artificial atoms to quantum information machines: Inside the 2025 Nobel Prize in physics,"nobel prize, nobel prize 2025, particle physics, physics, quantum information science, quantum mechanics, superconductivity","The 2025 Nobel Prize in physics honors three quantum physicists – John Clarke , Michel H. Devoret and John M. Martinis – for their study of quantum mechanics in a macroscopic electrical circuit. Since the prize announcement, cheers and excitement have surrounded the home institutions of these laureates in Berkeley, Santa Barbara and New Haven. The award of this prestigious prize to pioneering research in quantum physics coincides with the 100th anniversary of the birth of quantum mechanics – a revolutionary scientific theory that forms the foundation of modern physics. Quantum mechanics was originally formulated to explain and predict the perplexing behaviors of atoms, molecules and subatomic particles. It has since paved the way for a wide range of practical applications, including precision measurement , laser technology , medical imaging and, probably the most far-reaching of all, semiconductor electronic devices and computer chips . Yet numerous aspects of the quantum world have long remained mysterious to scientists and engineers. From an experimental point of view, the tiny scale of microscopic particles poses outstanding challenges for studying the subtle laws of quantum mechanics in laboratory settings. The promises of quantum machines Since the closing decades of the past century, researchers around the world have sought to precisely isolate, control and measure individual physical objects, such as single photons and atomic ions , that display quantum behaviors under very specific experimental conditions. These endeavors have given rise to the emerging field of quantum engineering, which aims to utilize the peculiarities of quantum physics for groundbreaking technological innovations. John Clarke, an emeritus professor of physics at the University of California, Berkeley, speaks on Oct. 7, 2025, at a press conference on the campus celebrating his 2025 Nobel Prize in Physics. Karl Mondon/AFP via Getty Images One of the most promising directions is quantum information processing , whose goal is to design and implement machines that can encode, process, transmit and detect information in “strange” quantum manners: For instance, an object can be in a superposition of different states at the same time. Distant objects can manifest quantum entanglement – remote correlations that escape all possible classical interpretation. Compared with their conventional electronics predecessors, quantum information machines could have advantages in specific tasks of computation, simulation, cryptography and sensing. The realization of such quantum machines would require experimenters having access to reliable physical components that can be assembled and controlled on the human scale, yet fully obey quantum mechanics. Counterintuitive as it might sound, can we break the implicit boundaries of the natural world and bring microscopic physical laws into the macroscopic reality? Quantum mechanics in an electrical circuit In 1985, the three Nobel laureates – then working in the same research group at the University of California, Berkeley – provided an affirmative answer to the question above. They were studying electrical circuits made of superconductors . Superconductivity is a special state of matter famous for conducting electrical currents without resistance, due to underlying quantum mechanical interactions of electrons at low temperatures. For the first time, the trio observed distinct quantum behaviors of a macroscopic physical variable. 2025 Nobel laureate Michel Devoret (front) leads a hiking group in the French Alps during the 2019 Les Houches Physics Summer School on ‘Quantum Information Machines.’ Photographed by the author, Zhixin Wang. In a superconductor, two electrons bond together to form a Cooper pair . These electron pairs condense into a macroscopic state, which can be described by a collective phase variable shared by all its microscopic constituents. In this state, trillions or more electrons effectively behave like a single entity, resembling the mass collections of atoms that form everyday objects like pendulums or billiard balls. To observe the quantum mechanical motion of this macroscopic phase variable, the three scientists fabricated a device called the Josephson junction , which consists of two pieces of superconductors separated by an insulator layer thinner than 1/10,000 of a human hair. They discovered that, at sufficiently low temperatures (below −273 degrees Celsius, or −459 degrees Fahrenheit), the phase variable difference across the Josephson junction shows a unique quantum mechanical phenomenon known as quantum tunneling , where an object may escape a barrier without the need to climb over its summit. Furthermore, the team exposed the Josephson junction to microwave electromagnetic radiation whose frequency is close to that of Wi-Fi signals. They measured energy levels of the circuit at discrete, or quantized, values , which are usually present only in microscopic atoms and molecules. The device used in these experiments can thus be referred to as an “artificial atom” – namely, an electrical circuit with atom-like properties, which is at once macroscopic in size, adjustable in design, and quantum mechanical in nature. Implications and outlooks The groundbreaking works by Clarke, Devoret and Martinis have had many profound impacts. On the fundamental level, they suggested that distinct quantum phenomena – once thought to exist only at the microscopic level – can actually manifest at much larger physical scales. In the meantime, the invention of superconducting artificial atoms has opened brand-new avenues toward building useful quantum machines with advanced engineering techniques. Based on these discoveries, researchers – including these Nobel Prize recipients and their research groups – have made significant achievements in constructing prototype quantum computers using superconducting quantum circuits in the decades since. The elementary device unit that makes up these information processors is the superconducting quantum bit , or “qubit” for short. Each superconducting qubit is an artificial atom containing one or more Josephson junctions. Its quantum state can be precisely prepared, manipulated and measured by experimenters. The perfection and integration of superconducting qubits are among the state-of-the-art challenges in quantum information technology. 2025 Nobel laureate John Martinis discusses the roadmap of building a quantum computer at the 2016 Adiabatic Quantum Computing Conference in Los Angeles. The 2025 Nobel Prize for physics recognizes original investigations in the intersection of basic and applied sciences. The prize recipients tested profound quantum mechanical hypotheses through clear and rigorous experimentation. From those artificial atoms have emerged the audacious efforts and rapid progress in building practical quantum information machines. The combination of pure intellectual inquiries and engineering advancement has been shaping this interdisciplinary field since its creation. This Nobel Prize is therefore a tribute to the three inventors of superconducting quantum circuits, whose inquisitive minds, broad visions and adventurous attitudes represent the true scientific spirit and will continue to inspire future generations.",https://theconversation.com/from-artificial-atoms-to-quantum-information-machines-inside-the-2025-nobel-prize-in-physics-266976,Society,BBC,Zhixin Wang,https://images.theconversation.com/files/695251/original/file-20251008-56-4eaa2b.jpeg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&rect=0%2C213%2C2560%2C1280&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop,2025-10-10T18:13:06+00:00,d09d79a9ed49c875999ac3ae8cf7a0cfc879a17c
81c37ca1344e,"Government shutdown hasn’t left US consumers glum about the economy – for now, at least","consumers, government shutdown, us federal reserve, us economy, consumer sentiment, economic data","The ongoing federal shutdown has resulted in a pause on regular government data releases, meaning economic data has been in short supply of late. That has left market-watchers and monetary policymakers somewhat in the dark over key indicators in the U.S. economy. Fortunately, the University of Michigan’s Surveys of Consumers is unaffected by the impasse in Washington and released its preliminary monthly report on Oct. 10, 2025; the final read of the month will be released in two weeks. The Conversation U.S. spoke with Joanne Hsu , the director of the Surveys of Consumers, on what the latest data shows about consumer sentiment – and whether the shutdown has left Americans feeling blue. What is consumer sentiment? Consumer sentiment is something that we at the University of Michigan have measured since 1946 . It looks at American attitudes toward the current state of the economy and the future direction of the economy through questions on personal finances, business conditions and buying conditions for big-ticket items. Over the decades, it has been closely followed by policymakers, business leaders, academic researchers and investors as a leading indicator of the overall state of the economy. When sentiment is on the decline, consumers tend to pull back on spending – and that can lead to a slowdown in the economy. The opposite is also true: High or rising sentiment tends to lead to increased spending and a growing economy. How is the survey compiled? Every month, we interview a random sample of the U.S. population across the 48 contiguous states and the District of Columbia. Around 1,000 or so people take part in it every month, and we include a representative sample across ages, income, education level, demography and geography. People from across all walks of life are asked around 50 questions pertaining to the economy, personal finances, job prospects, inflation expectations and the like. When you aggregate that all together, it gives a useful measure of the health of the U.S. economy. What does the latest survey show? The latest survey shows virtually no change in overall sentiment between September and October. Consumers are not feeling that optimistic at the moment, but generally no worse than they were last month. Pocketbook issues – high prices of goods, inflation and possible weakening in the labor market – are suppressing sentiment. Views of consumers across the country converged earlier in the year when the Trump administration’s tariffs were announced. But since then, higher-wealth and higher-income consumers have reported improved consumer sentiment. It is for lower-income Americans – those not owning stock – that sentiment hasn’t lifted since April. University of Michigan In October, we also saw a slight decline in inflation expectations, but it remains relatively high – midway between where they were around a year ago and the highs of around the time of the tariff announcements in April and May. Has the government shutdown affected consumer sentiment? The government shutdown was in place for around half the time of the latest survey period, which ran from Sept. 23-Oct. 6, 2025. And so far, we are not seeing evidence that it is impacting consumer sentiment one way or another. And that is not super-surprising. It is not that people don’t care about the shutdown, just that it hasn’t affected how they see the economy and their personal finances yet. History shows that federal shutdowns do move the needle a little. In 2019, around 10% of people spontaneously mentioned the then-shutdown in the January survey. We saw a decline in sentiment in that month, but it did improve again the following month. Looking back, we tend to see stronger reaction to shutdowns when there is a debt ceiling crisis attached. In 2013, for example, there was a decline in consumer sentiment coinciding with concerns over the debt ceiling being breached. But it did quickly rebound when the government opened again. Whether or not we see a decline in sentiment because of the current shutdown depends on how long it lasts – and how consumers believe it will impact pocketbook issues, namely prices and job prospects.",https://theconversation.com/government-shutdown-hasnt-left-us-consumers-glum-about-the-economy-for-now-at-least-267264,Society,BBC,Joanne Hsu,https://images.theconversation.com/files/695676/original/file-20251010-56-sudaut.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&rect=0%2C151%2C6000%2C3000&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop,2025-10-10T17:25:40+00:00,e3d86a7cc59e2072454af651e81f287dbbdb1399
123b182b57d6,A white poet and a Sioux doctor fell in love after Wounded Knee – racism and sexism would drive them apart,"biography, books, indigenous americans, indigenous peoples day, interracial marriage, lakota, long reads, native americans, romance, south dakota, wounded knee","Like many star-crossed lovers, Elaine Goodale and Charles Alexander Eastman came from different worlds. Goodale, born in 1863 to a family claiming Puritan roots, grew up on a farm in a remote part of western Massachusetts. In 1858, a baby first named Hakadah, later called Ohíye S’a, who then became widely known as Charles Alexander Eastman for most of his adult life, was born near Redwood Falls, Minnesota. A Wahpeton Santee Dakota, he fled to Manitoba, Canada, with tribal members during the 1862 Dakota War between the U.S. military and several bands of Dakota collectively known as the Santee Sioux. In December 1890, the two unexpectedly met each other while working at the Pine Ridge Agency in the newly declared state of South Dakota. Even more improbably, they fell in love. Just weeks later, booming Hotchkiss rifles 15 miles away signaled the start of the Wounded Knee Massacre . Federal troops ended up killing at least 250 Lakota Sioux men, women and children; the traumatic event, historian David Martínez writes , sparked “the abrupt transformation of Indian nations from geopolitical powers … to symbols of conquest.” It also transformed Goodale and Eastman’s nascent relationship: They resolved to marry and to work together for Native American causes. Wounded Knee, however, would also prove an unfortunate metaphor for their marriage. In the research for my new dual biography, “ Love and Loss After Wounded Knee: A Biography of an Extraordinary Interracial Marriage ,” I dove into letters, photographs and hundreds of newspaper articles documenting this high-profile, late-19th-century relationship. I came to understand that their marriage failed not only because of interpersonal tensions and a clash of values, but also because of some of the ways in which ideas about gender, race and Indigenous identity were rapidly changing in the U.S. From writer to teacher At 13, Goodale started publishing poetry in St. Nicholas Magazine , a popular children’s periodical. Her poems generated attention from the press, in addition to fan mail from notable men of letters, including Henry Wadsworth Longfellow . By the time she was 20, she had published five books. Elaine Goodale Eastman in 1890, when she worked as the Supervisor of Education for the Dakotas. South Dakota Historical Society But because poets without family fortunes needed other means to support themselves – and because women in the late 1800s had few career options – Goodale turned to teaching. She accepted a job at Virginia’s Hampton Institute , a boarding school that was founded to teach newly emancipated Black students. It later became part of the government’s program to assimilate Native Americans. Goodale became convinced that Indigenous children would benefit more from schools in their own communities, rather than at government- or church-run boarding schools. She traveled to the Dakota Territory and opened a day school. She also turned from poetry to prose, documenting her observations of “Indian life and education” in dozens of articles. By the time she came to Pine Ridge Agency, the administrative offices at the Oglala Lakota Indian Reservation, she had been appointed the first supervisor of education for the Dakotas. The ideal ‘assimilated Indian’ Ohíye S’a’s early years were marked by family trauma and U.S. government policies aimed at seizing land and displacing and assimilating Native people. His mother died shortly after he was born, and during the Dakota War it was widely believed that his father and brothers had perished. His grandmother and uncle raised him until his mid-teenage years. Charles Eastman was often praised in the press for his academic accomplishments – and his willingness to assimilate. Wikimedia Commons In 1873, the 15-year-old was surprised to discover that his father was, in fact, alive. Jacob Eastman had taken a European-American name and converted to Christianity. He was convinced that only a formal English-language education could provide a path forward for Native people. At his father’s urging, Ohíye S’a became “Charles Eastman,” and he also converted to Christianity. He attended a series of boarding schools before landing at Dartmouth College and then Boston University Medical School . His white mentors saw Eastman – the only Native person in his class at either institution – as the ideal “assimilated Indian.” His achievements often appeared in newspapers with headlines like “He’s a Winner: Sioux Indian Who Got a Boston University Degree,” an allusion to the fact that “Ohíye S’a” translated to “winner.” It isn’t clear whether Eastman ever thought of himself in that way. But throughout his life, he straddled the world in which he was raised and the one in which he was educated. His first job, as agency physician at Pine Ridge, placed him at the nexus of these two cultures. An unlikely pair, a media sensation After the shots rang out near Wounded Knee Creek, Eastman’s medical education was put to the test. Called into service as a nurse, Goodale also tended the wounded and dying in the makeshift hospital at a nearby church. Six months later, Elaine and Charles were married in New York City in June 1891, much to the consternation of her family. A mass grave for Native Americans killed during the Wounded Knee Massacre. Ullstein Bild/Getty Images The couple’s nuptials appeared in hundreds of newspapers, partially due to the rarity of an interracial marriage in the 19th century. Much of the coverage was rife with racist stereotypes . The Watertown Times in New York proclaimed, “Poetess Marries a Big Injun’”; the San Francisco Examiner ran a front-page story declaring “Fair Bride of An Indian: Elaine Goodale Weds the Red Man of Her Choice.” Sometimes, articles focused on Charles’ educational background, often misrepresenting it by suggesting he had attended Cornell, Harvard or Yale. He was referred to as a “specimen,” with racialized language discussing his physical attributes: “He is of medium height … with all the peculiarities of his people in his features. His eyes are small and glittering, his face and nose are broad and his cheek bones very pronounced,” according to the San Francisco Examiner. This type of media coverage – highlighting the differences between Elaine and Charles’ backgrounds, while pointedly describing Charles in stereotyped ways – would dog them throughout their marriage. Professional travails, personal problems Charles attempted to set up his own medical practice in St. Paul, Minnesota. But white patients proved reluctant to see “an Indian doctor,” while Native patients were hesitant to patronize a physician dispensing unfamiliar medicines. The practice failed. Financial pressures increased over the next decade as Elaine and Charles became parents of six children. They moved frequently: Charles took on a series of jobs, including recruiting for the YMCA, lobbying on behalf of the Santee Sioux, and working as an “outing agent” at the Carlisle Indian Industrial School , which involved finding summer placements for Native students with white families in a further attempt to Americanize them. Because Charles left behind few personal papers, it’s difficult to know if he believed in this program. But it’s easy to see how it could have created an identity crisis of sorts. At other points in his life, Charles seemed to put his Dakota identity front and center. For example, he was one of the co-founders of the Society of American Indians, an organization that worked on behalf of self-determination for Native Americans. He even served as its president in 1918. Meanwhile, his wife remained a staunch believer in assimilation. At Elaine’s urging – and likely, under her editorial stewardship – Charles began publishing stories and then books about his “ Indian Boyhood .” While Elaine continued writing and was able to publish a few books, his literary career took off and hers stalled out.

Wikimedia Commons Even their children weren’t spared from the headlines. An article in the St. Paul Globe wrote, of one of the Eastman children, “… the child had not inherited any of the attractiveness of the mother. It was a veritable old squaw miniature.” In her personal writing, Elaine never acknowledged her children as biracial. The public stereotyping and private dismissal of the Eastman children’s identities were undoubtedly another stressor in an already-stressed marriage. Pictures worth a thousand words After many moves, the Eastmans landed in Amherst, Massachusetts. But Charles did not stay put, embarking upon a vigorous new career on the lecture circuit. He became one of the best-known Native Americans of his era, as well as one of the most photographed. Charles Eastman alternatively posed in Western dress and traditional Sioux regalia.

Often the coverage of his talks focused more on what he was wearing than the content of his lecture. Historian Kiara Vigil suggests that Charles knew that his dress functioned as an advertisement for his work , arguing that his choice of attire was strategic: “Eastman’s ability to dress up as an Indian, or not, enabled him to address diverse audiences and their expectations.” He was away from home more than he was present, further fueling Elaine’s resentment. In personal letters, she described her bitterness at Charles leaving the children and household to her sole care, and her belief that he was reinforcing the gender roles she’d railed against. While she certainly understood that his posing in buckskin and feathered headdress was good marketing, she probably never realized what reclaiming his Indigenous identity meant to Charles; she, too, thought of him as the product of successful assimilation. It all falls apart The personal and professional pressures on the Eastmans continued through the early years of the 20th century. They reached a breaking point after their second daughter , Irene Taluta, died in the 1918 influenza pandemic. The tragic loss of a beloved child continued to unravel an already frayed marriage. Elaine and Charles separated in 1921, though they never formally divorced. I’ve been interested in the Eastmans and their unlikely marriage since I first learned of it years ago. As I pieced together parts of this complex relationship, I became convinced that while their compelling story reveals much about late 19th and early 20th century America, it’s also a story for today. At a time of profoundly unsettling controversies around race, immigration and identity, the marriage of Elaine Goodale and Charles Eastman underscores why it can be so challenging for people from different backgrounds to truly understand each other. But their story – how their mutual commitment to improve life for Native American people brought them together, how their quest to educate the nation about a marginalized people gave them purpose, and the ways in which they melded the personal and the political – also suggests the importance of trying.",https://theconversation.com/a-white-poet-and-a-sioux-doctor-fell-in-love-after-wounded-knee-racism-and-sexism-would-drive-them-apart-263175,Society,BBC,Julie Dobrow,https://images.theconversation.com/files/695422/original/file-20251009-66-rg5jry.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&rect=0%2C212%2C3200%2C1600&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop,2025-10-10T14:23:00+00:00,6589b23bb7090d328641972c47d1d8f5b3a5b673
965790e40328,New president of The Church of Jesus Christ ofLatter-daySaints inherits a global faith far more diverse than many realize,"american christianity, christianity, church of jesus christ of latter-day saints (lds), diversity, mormons, religion and society, religious leaders","The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints has spent the past few weeks in a moment of both mourning and transition. On Sept. 28, 2025, a shooting and arson at a Latter-day Saints meetinghouse in Michigan killed four people and wounded eight more. What’s more, Russell M. Nelson, president of the church, died the day before at age 101. Dallin H. Oaks , the longest-serving of the church’s top leaders, was announced the new president on Oct. 14. Oaks will inherit leadership of a religious institution that is both deeply American and increasingly global – diversity at odds with the way it’s typically represented in mainstream media, from “ The Secret Life of Mormon Wives ” to “The Book of Mormon” Broadway musical . As a cultural anthropologist and ethnographer , I research Latter-day Saints communities across the United States, particularly Latina immigrants and young adults . When presenting my research, I’ve noticed that many people still closely associate the church with Utah, where its headquarters are located. The Latter-day Saints temple in Cochabamba, Bolivia, was dedicated in 2000. Parallelepiped09/Wikimedia Commons , CC BY-SA The church has played a pivotal role in Utah’s history and culture. Today, though, only 42% of its residents are members . The stereotype of Latter-day Saints as mostly white, conservative Americans is just one of many long-standing misconceptions about LDS communities and beliefs. Many people are surprised to learn there are vibrant congregations far from the American West’s “ Mormon Corridor .” There are devout Latter-day Saints everywhere from Ghana and the United Arab Emirates to Russia and mainland China . Global growth Joseph Smith founded The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in upstate New York in 1830 and immediately sent missionaries to preach along the frontier. The first overseas missionaries traveled to England in 1837. Shortly after World War II, church leaders overhauled their missionary approach to increase the number of international missions. This strategy led to growth across the globe , especially in Central America , South America and the Pacific Islands . Today, the church has over 17.5 million members , according to church records. A majority live outside the U.S. , spread across more than 160 countries . One way the church and researchers track this global growth is by construction of new temples .These buildings, used not for weekly worship but special ceremonies like weddings, were once almost exclusively located in the United States. Today, they exist in dozens of countries , from Argentina to Tonga. During Nelson’s presidency, which began in 2018, he announced 200 new temples , more than any of his predecessors. Temples are a physical and symbolic representation of the church’s commitment to being a global religion, although cultural tensions remain. Two missionaries for The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints walk through the Missionary Training Center in Provo, Utah, in 2008. AP Photo/George Frey Among U.S. members, demographics are also shifting. Seventy-two percent of American members are white, down from 85% in 2007, according to the Pew Research Center . Growing numbers of Latinos – 12% of U.S. members – have played a significant role sustaining congregations across the country. There are congregations in every U.S. state, including the small community of Grand Blanc, Michigan, site of the tragic shooting . Suspect Thomas Jacob Sanford , who was fatally shot by police, had gone on a recent tirade against Latter-day Saints during a conversation with a local political candidate. In the following days, an American member of the church raised hundreds of thousands of dollars for Sanford’s family. Growing pains Despite the church’s diversity, its institutional foundations remain firmly rooted in the United States. The top leadership bodies are still composed almost entirely of white men , and most are American-born. As the church continues to grow, questions arise about how well the norms of a Utah-based church fit the realities of members in Manila or Mexico City, Bangalore or Berlin. How much room is there, even in U.S. congregations, for local cultural expressions of faith? Latino Latter-day Saints and members in Latin America, for example, have faced pushback against cultural traditions that were seen as distinctly “not LDS,” such as making altars and giving offerings during Dia de los Muertos . In 2021, the church launched a Spanish-language campaign using Day of the Dead imagery to increase interest among Latinos. Many members were happy to see this representation. Still, some women I spoke with said that an emphasis on whiteness and American nationalism, as well as anti-immigrant rhetoric they’d heard from other members, deterred them from fully celebrating their cultures. People attend the twice-annual conference of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints on April 6, 2024, in Salt Lake City. AP Photo/Rick Bowmer Even aesthetic details, like musical styles, often reflect a distinctly American model. The standardized hymnal, for example, contains patriotic songs like “America the Beautiful.” This emphasis on American culture can feel especially out of sync in places in countries with high membership rates that have histories of U.S. military or political interventions. Expectations about clothing and physical appearance, too, have prompted questions about representation, belonging and authority. It was only in 2024, for instance, that the church offered members in humid areas sleeveless versions of the sacred garments Latter-day Saints wear under clothing as a reminder of their faith. Historically, the church viewed tattoos as taboo – a violation of the sanctity of the body . Many parts of the world have thousands of years of sacred tattooing traditions – including Oceania, which has high rates of church membership . Change ahead? Among many challenges, the next president of the church will navigate how to lead a global church from its American headquarters – a church that continues to be misunderstood and stereotyped, sometimes to the point of violence. The temple in Laie, Hawaii, opened in the early 1900s, making it one of the church’s oldest. Kaveh/Wikimedia Commons , CC BY-SA The number of Latter-day Saints continues to grow in many parts of the world, but this growth brings a greater need for cultural sensitivity. The church, historically very uniform in its efforts to standardize Latter-day Saints history, art and teachings, is finding that harder to maintain when congregations span dozens of countries, languages, customs and histories. Organizing the church like a corporation, with a top-down decision-making process, can also make it difficult to address painful racial histories and the needs of marginalized groups, like LGBTQ+ members . The transition in leadership offers an opportunity not only for the church but for the broader public to better understand the multifaceted, global nature of Latter-day Saints’ lives today.

17c48f01a7ed,Trump is cutting funding to universities with large Hispanic student populations – here’s what to know,"affirmative action, college students, education funding, federal funding, higher ed attainment, higher education, hispanic students, latino students, trump administration, us department of education, us latinos, us higher education, future of higher ed","The Trump administration is trying to eliminate diversity, equity and inclusion programs as part of a broader campaign to end what it calls “ wokeness ” in American education. As part of this rollback, the Justice Department announced in July 2025 that it would no longer “defend ” the federal definition of Hispanic-Serving Institutions, or HSIs. These are colleges where at least 25% of undergraduates identify as Hispanic or Latino. This is more than a legal technicality. It reflects the Justice Department’s position that HSI grants violate constitutional protections, putting millions of federal dollars for these schools at risk. Citing this legal rationale, the Department of Education confirmed in September that it had frozen US$350 million in education grants intended for Minority-Serving Institutions . This includes more than $250 million for HSIs, specifically. The Education Department argues that these programs amount to racial discrimination because they tie federal grants to students’ racial or ethnic backgrounds. This echoes the Supreme Court’s decision in 2023, which narrowed how colleges can consider race and ethnicity in admissions. I serve as the university diversity officer at California State University, Chico, an HSI. I am also an ethnic studies scholar who focuses on equity in higher education. Advocates for HSIs say ending federal funding would hurt already underfunded colleges , particularly those that serve large numbers of first-generation and low-income students. Elisa Castillo is the assistant vice president for Hispanic Serving Institution and Minority Serving Institution initiatives at Salem State University, a newly designated HSI in Salem, Mass. Pat Greenhouse/The Boston Globe via Getty Images What are Hispanic-Serving Institutions? Congress created the HSI designation in 1992, through an amendment to the 1965 Higher Education Act . This amendment authorizes federal grants to help strengthen colleges that enroll large numbers of Hispanic and low-income students, providing more opportunity for those students to succeed and graduate. There are more than 600 federally designated HSIs across the U.S. and Puerto Rico. California is home to the most HSIs, with 167, followed by Texas, Puerto Rico, New York and Illinois. In addition to showing that at least 25% of its student population is Hispanic or Latino, any college or university that wants to qualify as an HSI must also show that at least half of its students come from low-income backgrounds . Becoming an HSI allows colleges and universities to apply for federal funding intended to support underrepresented and low-income students. HSIs vary in size and mission HSIs enroll over 1.5 million Hispanic students , which amounts to over 60% of all Hispanic undergraduates in the U.S. This marks a big increase from the 340,000 Hispanic undergraduates who attended an HSI in 1995. Some of these schools are large public research universities, such as University of California, Riverside; University of California, Santa Barbara; and University of California, Santa Cruz. Others are regional institutions, private colleges and local community colleges. Over the past decade, another kind of Hispanic-Serving Institution has emerged – research-intensive HSIs. These are colleges and universities where at least 25% of the student body is Hispanic and where there is significant research funding and a range of doctoral programs offered. These schools include University of California, Irvine; Florida International University; and the University of Texas at El Paso, among others . Some researchers have debated whether the HSI category has become too broad, grouping schools with vastly different resources, missions and student populations. Despite their differences, many HSIs enroll large numbers of first-generation, low-income and working students, as well as immigrants and transfer students. HSIs also generally operate with fewer financial and academic resources than comparable non-HSI institutions. How HSI funding works Title V grants from the Department of Education are one clear way that HSIs can receive federal funding . These competitive grants are intended to help HSIs expand educational opportunities and institutional capacity to support Hispanic and low-income students. Rather than providing aid directly to students, Title V grants are used to offer faculty training, update classrooms and laboratories, create new degree programs and develop mentorship opportunities for first-generation students. At campuses such as California State University, Chico and University of California, Irvine, Title V grants have given schools the money to create bilingual advising services and maintain data systems. Title V grants form only one part of the broader funding picture for HSIs . Like many colleges, HSIs rely on state funding and tuition revenue. They also compete for other federal grants, including those from the National Science Foundation and the Department of Agriculture. How HSIs help Hispanic students A growing body of research shows that HSIs are crucial in helping more Hispanic and first-generation students attend and graduate college. Some HSIs have received national recognition for using evidence-based practices to help Hispanic students perform better in the classroom. Hispanic students at these schools, which include Arizona State University and California State University, Fullerton, graduate at rates roughly 8 percentage points higher than Hispanic students nationally. Hispanic students at HSIs graduate at rates more than 5 percentage points higher than those at comparable non-HSI colleges, according to similar 2017 findings from the nonprofit Education Trust. There are a few reasons why there is a relatively high graduation rate for Hispanic students at HSIs. Students at HSIs often report feeling a strong sense of belonging and see their own cultures reflected in the curriculum. Many HSI campuses also offer dedicated programs for first-generation students and train faculty to teach and advise with equity and inclusion in mind. At University of California, Irvine, where I helped lead HSI initiatives, Hispanic undergraduate enrollment grew by nearly 150% between 2009 and 2019, from 3,000 students to more than 7,500. During that time, more than 350 faculty and staff completed equity-focused training to strengthen advising and teaching practices that support Hispanic and other underrepresented students. Visitors to California State University, Fullerton take a guided campus tour. Jeff Gritchen/MediaNews Group/Orange County Register via Getty Images What’s at stake for HSIs Hispanic Americans now make up nearly 20% of the U.S. population , and their college enrollment numbers are projected to grow from about 3.7 million in 2020 to 4.5 million by 2030, as overall college enrollment numbers are projected to decline during this time. A national evaluation of Title V projects found that most colleges and universities used these grants to improve student services, develop new academic programs and build community partnerships that help first-generation and low-income students stay enrolled and complete their degrees. As HSI researchers note, graduation rates tell only part of the story. True student success at HSIs depends not just on graduation numbers, but on culturally responsive teaching, inclusive campus climates and equity-minded institutional practices. How policymakers define and fund HSIs will shape not only the future of these institutions but also whether this growing generation of Hispanic students can access, afford and complete college in the years ahead.",https://theconversation.com/trump-is-cutting-funding-to-universities-with-large-hispanic-student-populations-heres-what-to-know-251202,Society,BBC,Joseph Morales,https://images.theconversation.com/files/694907/original/file-20251007-56-lcbwd5.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&rect=0%2C155%2C3599%2C1799&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop,2025-10-10T12:38:34+00:00,6ce488a00744c52d8a53c8fc8af46d0db2254381
5157b65c566b,Political violence: What can happen when First Amendment free speech meets Second Amendment gun rights,"charlie kirk, constitutional democracy, dissent, donald trump, first amendment, free speech, guns, political violence, second amendment, us constitution, us supreme court","The assassination in September 2025 of conservative activist Charlie Kirk has heightened attention on the relationship between political rhetoric and political violence. Even before police had identified a suspect, President Donald Trump blamed the shooting on the “rhetoric” of the “radical left .” The Trump administration has since acted to silence left-leaning speakers and is threatening to intensify its attacks on left-wing political speech. But my decades of studying free speech law have convinced me that suppressing political rhetoric, even through social norms rather than law, undermines the discussion, debate and constructive disagreement essential for a healthy democracy . Gun proliferation complicates the problem by making political violence much easier to carry out. Rise of political violence Political violence – by which I mean any physical attack on people that aims to achieve a political goal – harms democracy by shifting the field of political disagreement from debate to aggression. Under the U.S. constitutional system of limited government and individual rights, political violence by the government – for example, government assaults on anti-government protesters – is among the gravest threats to liberty. But political violence committed by private individuals or groups also corrodes constitutional democracy. In the United States, acts of private political violence against members of government and against ordinary people have both increased dramatically in recent years. Political assassinations are the most vivid form of political violence. The Kirk assassination is only the latest example. An attendee at a candlelight vigil and prayer event for assassinated Turning Point USA Founder Charlie Kirk on Sept. 10, 2025, in Seattle. David Ryder/Getty Images In June 2025, a shooter with a “ hit list” of left-liberal targets assassinated Minnesota Democratic Rep. Melissa Hortman and her husband. In December 2024, a shooter angry about health insurance costs killed United Healthcare CEO Brian Thompson. In July 2024, a shooter wounded Trump at a campaign rally in a failed assassination attempt. Political violence also includes bias-motivated murders. In 2022, a white supremacist murdered 10 Black patrons at a grocery store in Buffalo, N.Y. In 2019, an anti-immigrant racist murdered 23 mostly Latino shoppers at a Wal-Mart in El Paso, Texas. In 2018, an antisemite murdered 11 congregants at a Pittsburgh synagogue . In those incidents and numerous others , extreme political ideas appear to have motivated the attackers. The linkage of extremist speech to lethal violence has prompted calls to legally restrict or punish extremist speech . Political violence, free speech and cultural editing The First Amendment, however, protects extremist speech , including advocacy of violence . Violent rhetoric must actually incite or threaten violence to lose the First Amendment’s shelter. If law cannot curb the sorts of speech that may inspire political violence, what about social norms – widely shared beliefs about what speech is socially acceptable or appropriate? Much speech that the First Amendment protects from government regulation eventually disappears from public discourse. That happens through a process I call “cultural editing”: popular and institutional rejection of outmoded or repellent ideas . For example, no serious medical conference discusses treating hay fever with cocaine , and no respectable political science panel includes Nazis. In a social media post after Charlie Kirk’s killing, President Donald Trump blamed ‘radical left’ rhetoric for political violence. The Trump administration’s blaming of the Kirk assassination on “radical left” rhetoric points toward a deeper level of cultural editing. Trump and other conservatives have not cited speech that advocated violence against Kirk. Instead, some conservative activists, spurred on by Trump administration officials, called for harassing and punishing critics of Kirk’s statements and actions. But such criticisms of Kirk, whatever their merits or lack thereof, fall within the scope of ordinary political debate. Kirk was not a government official, but he had strong influence in the Trump administration . Robust democratic discourse requires space for people to criticize such powerful figures. Large-scale cultural editing of those criticisms, amounting to suppression of left-leaning views, would hurt the public’s ability to discuss and resolve political disagreements. However, Trump and others who push for suppressing harsh political rhetoric might argue that the stakes of verbal attacks have increased . They might say that U.S. political culture can no longer indulge political invective because political violence has become more common. Political violence and guns That argument for suppressing harsh political speech ignores an independent cause of political violence: gun proliferation. Most political violence in the U.S. involves guns . Guns make political violence easier by erasing the distance between extremist ideas and lethal action. Hate or fanaticism can end a life in an instant, hundreds of yards from the victim . The U.S. has by far the highest number of civilian guns and rate of civilian gun ownership in the world. Since 2008, when the Supreme Court declared an individual Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms, annual U.S. gun purchases have increased from about 9 million to about 16 million . Governments often find regulating speech easier , even though less effective, than tackling underlying problems. At times, federal and state governments have addressed political violence by regulating guns . The 1994 federal assault weapons ban exemplifies regulatory efforts to curb overall gun violence. But the Supreme Court’s Second Amendment cases now appear to bar strong gun regulations . People in a democratic society need freedom to make harsh, even extreme political statements with a minimum of cultural editing. The Second Amendment protects access to lethal weapons. This combination of free speech and gun rights makes the growing problem of political violence much harder to solve.",https://theconversation.com/political-violence-what-can-happen-when-first-amendment-free-speech-meets-second-amendment-gun-rights-265223,Society,BBC,Gregory P.

It recognized a revolution quietly reshaping how scientists capture, store and sense molecules. These MOFs could allow for sensor technologies that make workplaces, the environment and human bodies safer. What are MOFs, and why do they matter? MOFs are made by linking metal ions – atoms that carry an electrical charge – with organic molecules, the carbon-based building blocks found in most living things. Together they form tiny, sponge-like structures full of microscopic pores . You can imagine them as an atomic-scale scaffold filled with nano-sized rooms, each precisely engineered to host certain molecules like guests. Metal-organic frameworks, such as MOF-5 shown here, have metal components, organic ‘linkers’ and a cavity that can allow in gases. Tony Boehle/Wikimedia Commons , CC BY-SA Because chemists can mix and match different metals and organic linkers, there are thousands of possible MOFs – each with unique properties. Depending on how they’re structured, some have so much internal surface area that a single gram could cover a football field. This sponge-like porosity – meaning lots of tiny holes inside – lets MOFs trap and release gases , store energy-rich fuels like hydrogen, and capture harmful pollutants . MOFs can use a variety of chemicals in their structure, which lets researchers fine-tune how strongly an MOF interacts with specific molecules. These features have already inspired potential uses such as capturing carbon dioxide from the air to reduce greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere, pulling clean water from humid air, and delivering medicines inside the body . Over the past decade, the unique properties of MOFs have also opened new possibilities for sensing and detection . Since 2016, our team of engineers has been developing MOF-based sensors that can detect certain gases and vapors in an environment in real time. These materials’ unique properties are opening new possibilities for sensing in health, safety and environmental monitoring. From a storage material to a sensing material When an MOF takes in gas or liquid molecules, its tiny framework changes ever so slightly: It may change in size, how it bends light, or how it conducts electricity, depending on what and how many molecules it absorbs. By connecting MOFs to devices that can sense changes in light or electricity, researchers can turn these tiny shifts into measurable signals such as light, frequency or voltage. The signals then reveal what chemical is present and how much of it there is. In simple terms, when molecules enter or leave the MOF’s pores, they slightly change how light travels through it or how electricity behaves around it, and those changes become the sensor’s readable output. Our group at Missouri University of Science and Technology has developed several kinds of MOF-based sensor platforms. Across all these platforms, the core idea is the same: MOFs act as selective sponges that temporarily hold certain gas molecules in their tiny cages, and our devices measure the timing and amount of this uptake and release. In one study, we attached a single crystal of a copper-based MOF called HKUST-1 to the smooth, flat end of a cut optical fiber – the same kind of thin glass strand used to carry internet and phone signals. This crystal-fiber combination worked as a tiny device that could measure how light waves interfere with each other. As nearby gas molecules moved into the tiny pores of the MOF crystal, the way it bent and reflected light changed slightly. The optical fiber – connected to a light source and detector – picked up these changes , allowing us to see in real time how many gas molecules the material was taking in. Our probes show not just that gas molecules enter the tiny cages of the MOF, but also how fast they come and go. By measuring both the amount and the speed of adsorption and release, we can tell which molecules are being taken up and in what proportion, when several are present together. This dynamic view helps us see, in real time, how the material selects one target gas over others. It turns adsorption into a measurable, useful signal for sensing and identification. In health care, an MOF can act like a selective sponge for specific breath molecules that indicate real, measurable diseases. For example, an MOF designed to adsorb acetone can capture and concentrate this gas from exhaled breath. Acetone levels rise above normal values in people with diabetic ketoacidosis , allowing the sensor to clearly and quantitatively detect the disease. Prof. Jie Huang and his team at Missouri S&T developed an MOF–based breath sensor, funded by the NIH, that was developed for COVID-19 and can also be employed for detecting disease biomarkers such as acetone and ammonia in exhaled breath. Michael Pierce/Missouri S&T Likewise, an MOF that selectively adsorbs ammonia can concentrate this compound from exhaled breath. Ammonia levels increase above normal values in people with chronic kidney disease, so the sensor can provide a definite indicator of reduced kidney function. Integrating such MOFs into sensor hardware would allow for sensitive, noninvasive screening for these two diseases, based on quantifiable breath markers. Coating a material in a thin layer of MOFs can take hours. But recently, we developed a quick and simple “droplet-drying” method that forms a crystal layer of the copper-based MOF HKUST-1 directly onto the end of an optical fiber in under two minutes. The resulting film, only about 1/20th the width of a human hair, acted as a high-performance gas sensor that detected humidity, ethanol or carbon dioxide in the environment within seconds. We also combined MOFs with a hand-held metal device that can sense changes in microwave signals – a bit like how a radio antenna picks up invisible waves in the air. When gas molecules entered the MOF layer, they slightly changed how the device responded to those waves, allowing it to detect gases with remarkable sensitivity. This sensor made for a low-cost, portable device that could tell one kind of gas molecule apart from another, rather than just detecting that some gas is present. It’s like having a nose that can tell apples from oranges, not just detect that something smells fruity. Our research suggests that MOF sensors within compact, energy-efficient devices can pick out specific molecules – even when only trace amounts are present in the air. The pores of an MOF can be designed to concentrate specific target molecules. All molecules smaller than the window to an MOF cage will get into the cage. So, we design the sensors so that the molecules we are interested in sensing will reside in the cages longer. The huge internal surface area created by these pores makes them incredibly responsive. Even just a few trapped molecules can trigger a clear signal. These sensors also work at room temperature and our research suggests they are more precise and adaptable than many traditional chemical sensors. Toward real-world impact The main challenges lie in improving MOFs’ long-term durability and environmental resistance. Many frameworks degrade under humidity or heat , though some research groups are looking into how to make them more stable . When combined with machine-learning algorithms, these sensors can learn to recognize patterns from several gases at once, rather than detecting just one chemical at a time – much like how a human nose can tell different smells apart. This capability could even extend to human breath monitoring , where subtle changes in exhaled gases provide early clues to diseases such as diabetes, lung infections or cancer. Researchers are working to embed MOFs into flexible films , printed circuits and wireless devices . With these new advances and further research, MOFs could bridge chemistry and engineering one day. As the Nobel Prize recognized, MOFs exemplify how design at the molecular scale can help mitigate problems humans face at a global scale. If researchers can scale up this technology and overcome the challenges, networks of fiber-optic and microwave MOF sensors could one day monitor industrial plants, pipelines and even human breath for unwanted chemicals to improve safety, efficiency and health.",https://theconversation.com/our-engineering-team-is-making-versatile-tiny-sensors-from-the-nobel-winning-metal-organic-frameworks-267103,Society,BBC,Bohong Zhang,https://images.theconversation.com/files/695514/original/file-20251009-56-ju8tur.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&rect=0%2C64%2C1200%2C600&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop,2025-10-10T12:37:10+00:00,d18d17eaea619efed8d4b7044b379da3f062efde

How do you know when someone will make a good friend? When is it time to move on from a friendship? Oftentimes, people rely on gut intuitions to answer these kinds of questions. In psychology research, there’s no universally accepted definition of a friend. Traditionally, when psychologists have analyzed friendship, it’s often been through the lens of exchange. How much did that friend do for me? How much did I do for them? The idea is that friendships are transactional, where friends stick around only as long as they are getting at least as much as they are giving in the friendship. But this focus doesn’t capture what feels like the essence of friendship for many people. We and our colleagues think another model for relationships – what we call risk-pooling – better matches what many people experience. In this kind of friendship, no one is keeping track of who did what for whom. Our research over the past decade suggests that this kind of friendship was essential for our ancient ancestors to survive the challenges they encountered. And we feel it’s essential for surviving the challenges of life today, whether navigating personal struggles or dealing with natural disasters. Social exchange theory focuses on whether friends are investing and getting the same amount from the relationship. tim scott/Moment via Getty Images A focus on what friends give you The traditional social exchange theory of friendship views relationships as transactions where people keep a tally of costs and benefits. Building on this framework, researchers have suggested that you approach each friendship with a running list of pluses and minuses to decide whether to maintain the bond. You keep friendships that provide more benefits than costs, and you end those that don’t. The theory holds that this balancing act comes into play when making decisions about what kinds of friendships to pursue and how to treat your friends . It’s even made its way into pop psychology self-help spaces. We contend that the biggest issue with social exchange theory is that it misses the nuances of real-life relationships. Frankly, the theory’s wrong: People often don’t use this cost-to-benefit ratio in their friendships. Less accounting, more supporting Anybody who has seen a friend through tough times – or been the one who was supported – can tell you that keeping track of what a friend does for you isn’t what friendships are about. Friendships are more about companionship, enjoyment and bonding. Sometimes, friendship is about helping just because your friend is in need and you care about their well-being. Social exchange theory would suggest that you’d be better off dropping someone who is going through cancer treatment or a death in the family because they’re not providing as many benefits to you as they could. But real-life experiences with these situations suggest the opposite: These are the times when many people are most likely to support their friends . Our research is consistent with this intuition about the shortcomings of social exchange theory. When we surveyed people about what they want in a friend , they didn’t place a high value on having a friend who is conscientious about paying back any debts – something highly valued from a social exchange perspective. People considered other traits – such as loyalty, reliability, respectfulness and being there in times of need – to be much more important. These qualities that relate to emotional commitment were seen as necessities, while paying back was seen as a luxury that mattered only once the emotional commitment was met. Having friends who will help you when you’re struggling, work with you in the friendship and provide emotional support all ranked higher in importance than having a friend who pays you back. While they might not always be able to provide tangible benefits, friends can show they care in many other ways. Of course, friendship isn’t always positive . Some friends can take advantage by asking too much or neglecting responsibilities they could handle themselves. In those cases, it can be useful to step back and weigh the costs and benefits. Friendship is more than the sum of its parts But how do friendships actually help people survive? That is one question that we investigated as part of The Human Generosity Project , a cross-disciplinary research collaboration. The risk-pooling rather than exchange pattern of friendship is something that we found across societies , from “ kere kere” in Fiji to “ tomor marang” among the Ik in Uganda . People help their friends in times of need without expecting to be paid back. Maasai people cultivate lifelong relationships called osotua partnerships. calm_eyes/iStock via Getty Images Plus The Maasai, an Indigenous group in Kenya and Tanzania who rely on cattle herds to make their living, cultivate friends who help them when they are in need, with no expectation about paying each other back . People ask for help from these special friends, called osotua partners, only when they are in genuine need, and they give if they are asked and able. These partnerships are not about everyday favors – rather, they are about surviving unpredictable, life-altering risks. Osotua relationships are built over a lifetime, passed down across generations and often marked with sacred rituals. When we modeled how these osotua relationships function over time, we found they help people survive when their environments are volatile and when they ask those most likely to be able to help . These relationships lead to higher rates of survival for both partners compared to those built on keeping track of debts . These friends act as social insurance systems for each other, helping each other when needs arise because of unpredictable and uncontrollable events. And we see this in the United States, just as we do in smaller-scale, more remote societies. In one study, we focused on ranchers in southern Arizona and New Mexico embedded in a network of what they call “neighboring.” They don’t expect to be paid back when they help their neighbors with unpredictable challenges such as an accident, injury or illness. We also found this same pattern in an online study of U.S.-based participants. In contrast, people such as the ranchers we studied are more likely to expect to be paid back for help when needs arise because of more predictable challenges such as branding cattle or paying bills . Catastrophic insurance, not tit for tat What all this research suggests is that friendship is less about the exchange of favors and more about being there for each other when unforeseeable disaster strikes. Friendship seems more like an insurance plan designed to kick in when you need it most rather than a system of balanced exchange. What lets these partnerships endure is not only generosity, but also restraint and responsibility: Maasai expect their osotua partners to take care of themselves when they can and to ask only when help is truly needed. That balance of care, respect and self-management offers a useful model. In a world of growing uncertainty, cultivating risk-pooling friendships and striving to be a good partner yourself may help you build resilience. Our ancestors survived with the help of this kind of relationship; our future may depend on them too.",https://theconversation.com/friendships-arent-just-about-keeping-score-new-psychology-research-looks-at-why-we-help-our-friends-when-they-need-it-258549,Society,BBC,Athena Aktipis,https://images.theconversation.com/files/695420/original/file-20251009-56-mbh2co.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&rect=0%2C730%2C7913%2C3956&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop,2025-10-10T12:36:44+00:00,a996e17834044c4ceffe2f2b0f61095a0f157584
888e440d5558,"How pollution and the microbiome interact with Tregs, the immune system regulators whose discovery was honored with the Nobel Prize","2025 nobel prize in physiology or medicine, arthritis, autoimmune diseases, autoimmune response, immune cells, immune system, immunity, immunology, nobel prize 2025, t cells","A special group of immune cells known as regulatory T cells, or Tregs for short, became an overnight sensation when a trio of U.S. and Japanese scientists won the Nobel Prize in physiology or medicine on Oct. 6, 2025, for their discovery and elucidation of these cells. Treg cells act as the “master regulators” of the immune system – much like conductors leading an orchestra – ensuring that all other immune cells work in harmony. People with too few or defective Treg cells often develop autoimmune diseases , where unchecked immune cells mistakenly attack the body’s own tissues or organs. Yet when Treg cells become too numerous, people can become more susceptible to cancer and infections . For this reason, Treg cells are often described as a double-edged sword. Treg cells also control internal revolt in the form of an overactive immune response by other immune cells that can trigger allergies and autoimmune diseases such as arthritis , lupus and multiple sclerosis – diseases that develop when Treg cells are defective in either number, function or both. The well-established functions of Treg cells in autoimmune diseases, cancer and infections have recently been complemented by research unraveling how environmental factors influence these cells and modulate the immune response. We are a husband-wife team of immunologists who study how environmental factors such as chemicals, diet and gut bacteria affect Treg cells and the overall functioning of the immune system . While our study dating back to 1984 found that certain environmental contaminants induce T cells that suppress the immune system , further study on such cells was hampered by an inability in the field at large to isolate and characterize these cells. The discoveries honored by this year’s Nobel Prize transformed how researchers understand the immune system. One of the three Nobel Prize-winning researchers, Mary E. Brunkow, responds emotionally as she receives the news of the prize. AP Photo/Lindsey Wasson The interplay of environmental factors The environment plays a profound role in regulating the development, maintenance and functions of Treg cells . Some examples of environmental factors include chemical pollutants found in the air and water, microbes, sunlight, diet and medications. Rather than being a single, static population, Treg cells are highly adaptable . They integrate a variety of environmental cues to either suppress or manage immune responses. They accomplish this by producing key molecules such as FoxP3 that send a signal to other immune cells to stop mounting an aggressive immune response. Certain toxic chemicals can increase the number or activity of Treg cells . One of the best-known examples is a group of long-lasting pollutants called dioxins that accumulate in fatty tissues through consumption of contaminated meat, dairy and fish . They are produced from burning waste as well as chemical manufacturing and forest fires. The most toxic dioxin, 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin, or TCDD, is a known human carcinogen . Researchers have linked exposure to this chemical to various health problems, including cancer and reproductive and developmental issues . Research shows that dioxins activate Treg cells through a sensor known as the aryl hydrocarbon receptor . This constitutes one of the mechanisms through which certain environmental chemicals promote cancer by enhancing Treg activity and suppressing the anti-cancer immune response. Air pollution, such as diesel exhaust, can have the opposite effect, impairing Treg cell function and contributing to inflammatory diseases such as asthma . This may occur through damage to the FoxP3 gene . Regulatory T cells, or Treg cells, are one of at least five major types of T cells. ttsz/iStock via Getty Images Plus How diet interacts with Treg cells Diet also plays a powerful role in regulating Treg cells. Compounds known as indoles, found in vegetables from the cabbage family such as broccoli, cabbage and cauliflower, can activate Treg cells and help prevent gut inflammation . These compounds also work by stimulating the aryl hydrocarbon receptor, which boosts Treg numbers and activity. Another way diet can influence Treg cells is through the regulation of the microbes that live in the gut . The gut has trillions of microbial residents, both benefical and harmful . Previous research found that Treg cells in the gut play a crucial role in maintaining gut homeostasis – the dynamic balance between microbiota and immune cells found in the gut. Any disturbance leading to loss of Treg cell function can lead to hyperactivation of other immune cells in the gut. This can trigger inflammation in which the immune cells destroy the lining of the intestine, leading to conditions such as inflammatory bowel disease . Other naturally occurring substances – such as naringenin , a chemical abundant in citrus fruits, and epigallocatechin-3-gallate , a compound found in green tea – also activate the aryl hydrocarbon receptor and promote Treg development. A fiber-rich diet supports the growth of beneficial gut bacteria. This bacteria ferments fiber into short-chain fatty acids that enhance Treg cell function and help maintain gut health. Probiotic bacteria also increases Treg cell populations, thereby reducing inflammation. In addition, dietary tryptophan – an amino acid found in foods such as poultry, eggs, tofu and seeds – is metabolized into compounds that activate the aryl hydrocarbon receptor , further boosting Treg cell activity and protecting against gut inflammation. By contrast, a Western diet high in fat, sugar and processed foods disrupts the balance of gut bacteria . This, in turn, reduces the population of microbes that support Treg cells and promotes a more inflammatory environment in the gut. Keeping Treg cells in harmony Scientists like us and many others are working to understand the processes involved in maintaining the delicate balance of Treg cells that are influenced by all of these outside factors. The goal is to learn how Treg cells and other immune cells can be kept in equilibrium – strong enough to defend against infections and cancer yet restrained enough to prevent autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. The profound environmental influence on Treg cell development and function makes understanding these interactions crucial for defining the fine line between health and disease.",https://theconversation.com/how-pollution-and-the-microbiome-interact-with-tregs-the-immune-system-regulators-whose-discovery-was-honored-with-the-nobel-prize-266865,Society,BBC,Mitzi Nagarkatti,https://images.theconversation.com/files/695469/original/file-20251009-66-nxlyba.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&rect=0%2C0%2C4237%2C2118&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop,2025-10-10T12:36:08+00:00,320ba8c6a2462b03eff3eb9d7b547f372659facc
2a403fc828d6,Flu season has arrived – and so have updated flu vaccines,"centers for disease control and prevention (cdc), cold weather, flu season, flu strains, flu vaccines, influenza, public health, vaccination, vaccines","As the autumn’s cool weather settles in, so does flu season – bringing with it the familiar experiences of sniffles, fever and cough. Every year, influenza – the flu – affects millions of people. Most will experience the infection as a mild to moderate illness – but for some, it can be severe, potentially resulting in hospitalization and even death. While the start of flu season may feel routine, it’s important to remember that the virus changes every year, making annual vaccination an important part of staying healthy . What to expect this flu season Public health experts are closely watching how this year’s flu season unfolds. Early reports suggest that the U.S. may see a moderate level of flu cases , partly because last year’s flu activity was high and it’s uncommon to have two severe flu seasons in a row. However, the U.S. also uses data from the Southern Hemisphere’s earlier flu season, which lasts from April to October, to help predict what the season might look like. There, the flu season has been more severe than in years past . Taken together, that means there could be a significant number of flu cases in the U.S., particularly among children, older adults and those with chronic health conditions . Each year, the flu vaccine is updated to best match the strains of influenza expected to circulate. Because flu viruses mutate frequently , the effectiveness of the flu vaccine can vary each year. However, even when the match between the seasonal flu and the vaccine that is designed around it isn’t perfect, vaccination remains the best protection against severe illness . In the U.S., all flu vaccines for the 2025-2026 season will be trivalent – which means they are formulated to protect against the three main groups of influenza virus strains. These are an A (H1N1) virus, an A (H3N2) virus and a B/Victoria virus. The flu vaccine protects against severe illness from an influenza infection. Jacob Wackerhausen/iStock via Getty Images Plus Vaccine availability Recent vaccine policy changes have created some confusion, particularly around COVID-19 vaccines . Many people are wondering if getting the flu vaccine has become more complicated. The good news is that flu vaccines remain widely available and accessible. Pharmacies, doctors’ offices, public health clinics and many workplaces are offering the seasonal shot, often at little or no cost. The 2025-2026 flu vaccine is available now. Manufacturers start shipping vaccines doses in July and August to ensure access by September. While public health experts won’t know the exact effectiveness of the flu vaccine until flu season is over, the flu shot usually cuts your chances of needing to see a doctor for the flu by about half. Vaccination helps reduce the severity of illness , the likelihood of hospitalization and the spread of infection within our communities. It’s important to note that you can get the flu shot at the same time as other vaccines , such as the COVID-19 vaccine or the RSV and pneumonia vaccines for older adults, without compromising effectiveness. If you’re unsure which vaccines are right for you, your health care provider or pharmacist can help you decide based on your age and health status. Who should get the flu shot The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that everyone 6 months and older receive the flu vaccine each year , with rare exceptions. That aligns with guidelines from other organizations, such as the American Association of Pediatrics . The flu vaccine is especially important for: • Adults 65 and older • Children under 5 – and particularly those under 2 • Pregnant people • People with chronic conditions such as asthma, diabetes or heart disease • Health care workers and caregivers Even if you’re healthy and rarely get sick, getting vaccinated protects not only you but also those around you who may be more vulnerable. Practical prevention tips In addition to vaccination, everyday actions help reduce the spread of flu and other respiratory viruses: • Wash your hands frequently with soap and water. • Cover your coughs and sneezes. • Stay home if you’re feeling unwell. • Consider wearing a mask in crowded indoor spaces during peak flu activity, particularly if you have a cough. Even though flu season is part of life, serious illness doesn’t have to be. By staying informed, getting vaccinated and practicing healthy habits, everyone can play a role in keeping their communities safe and healthy. If you haven’t gotten your flu shot yet, now’s the time to protect yourself, and those you care for, this flu season.",https://theconversation.com/flu-season-has-arrived-and-so-have-updated-flu-vaccines-267058,Society,BBC,Libby Richards,https://images.theconversation.com/files/695489/original/file-20251009-56-q9jfrl.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&rect=0%2C602%2C7218%2C3609&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop,2025-10-10T12:35:28+00:00,b33ea072e9b6aa92a8fcfc2a69b039fc50ad4bec
47cbc51ada3f,Can you really be addicted to food? Researchers are uncovering convincing similarities to drug addiction,"addiction, diet, food, food addiction, food science, nutrition, processed food, sugar, ultra-processed food","People often joke that their favorite snack is “like crack” or call themselves “chocoholics” in jest. But can someone really be addicted to food in the same way they could be hooked on substances such as alcohol or nicotine? As an addiction psychiatrist and researcher with experience in treating eating disorders and obesity, I have been following the research in this field for the past few decades. I have written a textbook on food addiction, obesity and overeating disorders , and, more recently, a self-help book for people who have intense cravings and obsessions for some foods . While there is still some debate among psychologists and scientists, a consensus is emerging that food addiction is a real phenomenon . Hundreds of studies have confirmed that certain foods – often those that are high in sugar and ultraprocessed – affect the brains and behavior of certain people similarly to other addictive substances such as nicotine . Still, many questions remain about which foods are addictive, which people are most susceptible to this addiction and why. There are also questions as to how this condition compares to other substance addictions and whether the same treatments could work for patients struggling with any kind of addiction. How does addiction work? The neurobiological mechanisms of addiction have been mapped out through decades of laboratory-based research using neuroimaging and cognitive neuroscience approaches. Studies show that preexisting genetic and environmental factors set the stage for developing an addiction . Regularly consuming an addictive substance then causes a rewiring of several important brain systems , leading the person to crave more and more of it. This rewiring takes place in three key brain networks that correspond to key functional domains , often referred to as the reward system , the stress response system and the system in charge of executive control . First, using an addictive substance causes the release of a chemical messenger called dopamine in the reward network, which makes the user feel good. Dopamine release also facilitates a neurobiological process called conditioning , which is basically a neural learning process that gives rise to habit formation. As a result of the conditioning process, sensory cues associated with the substance start to have increasing influence over decision-making and behavior , often leading to a craving. For instance, because of conditioning, the sight of a needle can drive a person to set aside their commitment to quit using an injectable drug and return to it. Second, continued use of an addictive substance over time affects the brain’s emotional or stress response network. The user’s body and mind build up a tolerance, meaning they need increasing amounts of the substance to feel its effect. The neurochemicals involved in this process are different than those mediating habit formation and include a chemical messenger called noradrenaline and internally produced opioids such as endorphins. If they quit using the substance, they experience symptoms of withdrawal , which can range from irritability and nausea to paranoia and seizures. At that point, negative reinforcement kicks in . This is the process by which a person keeps going back to a substance because they’ve learned that using the substance doesn’t just feel good, but it also relieves negative emotions. During withdrawal from a substance, people feel profound emotional discomfort, including sadness and irritability. Negative reinforcement is why someone who is trying to quit smoking, for instance, will be at highest risk of relapse in the week just after stopping and during times of stress, because in the past they’d normally turn to cigarettes for relief. Third, overuse of most addictive substances progressively damages the brain’s executive control network, the prefrontal cortex , and other key parts of the brain involved in impulse control and self-regulation . Over time, the damage to these areas makes it more and more difficult for the user to control their behavior around these substances. This is why it is so hard for long-term users of many addictive substances to quit. Scientists have learned more about what’s happening in a person’s brain when they become addicted to a substance. What evidence is there that food is addictive? Many studies over the past 25 years have shown that high-sugar and other highly pleasurable foods – often foods that are ultraprocessed – act on these brain networks in ways that are similar to other addictive substances . The resulting changes in the brain fuel further craving for and overuse of the substance – in this case, highly rewarding food. Clinical studies have demonstrated that people with an addictive relationship to food demonstrate the hallmark signs of a substance use disorder . Studies also indicate that for some people, cravings for highly palatable foods go well beyond just a normal hankering for a snack and are, in fact, signs of addictive behavior. One study found that cues associated with highly pleasurable foods activate the reward centers in the brain, and the degree of activation predicts weight gain . In other words, the more power the food cue has to capture a person’s attention, the more likely they are to succumb to cravings for it. Multiple studies have also found that suddenly ending a diet that’s high in sugar can cause withdrawal , similar to when people quit opioids or nicotine . Excessive exposure to high-sugar foods has also been found to reduce cognitive function and cause damage to the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus , the parts of the brain that mediate executive control and memory. In another study, when obese people were exposed to food and told to resist their craving for it by ignoring it or thinking about something else, their prefrontal cortexes were more active compared with nonobese individuals. This indicates that it was more difficult for the obese group to fight their cravings. Researchers are still working out the best methods to help patients with food addictions develop a healthy relationship with food. Viktar Sarkisian/iStock via Getty Images Plus Finding safe treatments for patients struggling with food Addiction recovery is often centered on the idea that the fastest way to get well is to abstain from the problem substance. But unlike nicotine or narcotics, food is something that all people need to survive, so quitting cold turkey isn’t an option. In addition, eating disorders such as bulimia nervosa and binge-eating disorder often occur alongside addictive eating . Most psychologists and psychiatrists believe these illnesses have their root cause in excessive dietary restriction . For this reason, many eating disorder treatment professionals balk at the idea of labeling some foods as addictive. They are concerned that encouraging abstinence from particular foods could trigger binge eating and extreme dieting to compensate . A way forward But others argue that, with care, integrating food addiction approaches into eating disorders treatment is feasible and could be lifesaving for some. The emerging consensus around this link is moving researchers and those who treat eating disorders to consider food addiction in their treatment models . One such approach might look like the one described to me by addiction psychiatrist and eating disorders specialist Dr. Kim Dennis. In line with traditional eating disorder treatment, nutritionists at her residential clinic strongly discourage their patients from restricting calories. At the same time, in line with traditional addiction treatment, they help their patients to consider significantly reducing or completely abstaining from particular foods to which they have developed an addictive relationship. Additional clinical studies are already being carried out . But going forward, more studies are needed to help clinicians find the most effective treatments for people with an addictive relationship with food. Efforts are underway by groups of psychologists, psychiatrists, neuroscientists and mental health providers to get “ultraprocessed food use disorder,” also known as food addiction, into future editions of diagnostic manuals such as the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders and the World Health Organization’s International Classification of Diseases . Beyond acknowledging what those treating food addiction are already seeing in the field, this would help researchers get funding for additional studies of treating food addiction. With more information about what treatments will work best for whom, those who have these problems will no longer have to suffer in silence, and providers will be better equipped to help them.",https://theconversation.com/can-you-really-be-addicted-to-food-researchers-are-uncovering-convincing-similarities-to-drug-addiction-261727,Society,BBC,Claire Wilcox,https://images.theconversation.com/files/692199/original/file-20250922-56-lhkv8d.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&rect=0%2C518%2C5435%2C2717&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop,2025-10-10T12:34:13+00:00,164e722f46bad9699c04468e95d0ee5c71eb59aa
ecdd8ba69750,"Forwar-wearySyria, potential benefits of security pact with Israel comes with big risks","ahmed al-sharaa, bashar al-assad, benjamin netanyahu, diplomacy, golan heights, israel, middle east, syria, war","On Sept. 21, 2025, a senior U.S official boasted that an Israeli-Syrian security agreement to resolve months of conflict was “99% complete” and would be announced within two weeks. Those two weeks have now passed. And the reality on the ground suggests that the two countries are still far from sealing any deal to end the Israeli military incursions into Syrian territory that have occurred since the fall of Syrian President Bashar Assad in December 2024. Just days after the American official gave his prognosis and as negotiations continued, Israel struck several Syrian targets . Citing negotiation sources, several news outlets reported that the delay in securing a deal was primarily related to Israel’s 11th-hour demand of creating a so-called humanitarian corridor that would link the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights to Sweidah, a city in southern Syria . Israel said the purpose is to protect religious minorities in the Golan Heights and Sweidah. The hitch, after months of U.S.-mediated talks, reflects Syria’s vulnerability in these negotiations. Seeking to move on after year of war, the current Syrian leadership is eager to snuff out remaining internal violence, secure the borders and return to the United Nations-brokered truce with Israel that had been in place for decades. However, concluding a deal with its militarily superior neighbor risks the further fragmentation of Syria and an entrenched violation of its sovereignty. Indeed, as an expert on the Middle East , I believe the talks and the potential last-minute snag point to Israel believing it has the upper hand. Meanwhile for Syria, a desire for security can’t mask what it sees as Israel’s expansionist policy in the region , and concerns that it is using things like a proposed humanitarian corridor as a way to achieve recognition of areas only recently under Israeli control. The fraught history of Syrian-Israeli relations Following the United Nations’ partition of Palestine in 1947 and the proclamation of the state of Israel in 1948, a coalition of five Arab armies , including Syria, declared war on Israel and lost the ensuing conflict. Israeli soldiers stand guard as Syrian Druze people cross back into Syria at the Israeli-Syrian border in the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights town of Majdal Shams. AP Photo/Leo Correa As a result, Syria was forced to sign an armistice agreement with Israel on July 20, 1949. Yet de facto peace never lasted long. The two countries squared off in repeated conflicts in the next 25 years, including the Six-Day War in 1967 that launched Israel’s still-ongoing occupation of Syria’s Golan Heights . In 1974, the U.N. brokered the Agreement on Disengagement between Israeli and Syrian forces. While not a peace agreement, the pact served to codify a ceasefire and created a buffer zone between the two countries monitored by U.N. observers. For 50 years, that status quo held uneasily , as subsequent peace efforts failed . The conflict was effectively frozen, punctuated by occasional flare-ups of violence. Entering the post-Assad era The fall of Assad and his goverment in December 2024 suddenly injected a new dose of uncertainty into Israel-Syria relations. As rebel-turned interim President Ahmed al-Sharaa worked to consolidate power and vowed to restore peace and stability for his war-torn country, Israel went on the offensive. Shortly after the collapse of the Assad government, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu declared the 1974 Disengagement Agreement “ void until order is restored in Syria .” As a result, and in violation of the agreement, Israel occupied the demilitarized zone in the Golan Heights and expanded its control inside Syria. For months, Israel has conducted a campaign of airstrikes across Syria , repeatedly bombing Syrian military positions, including near the presidential palace in Damascus. Israel says it is doing so to stop weapon transfers from Iran and to protect its borders and ensure its security. At the same time, it has pressed the U.S. to keep Syria weak and divided , in part due to Netanyahu’s and his far-right coalition’s hostility to an Islamist-governed neighbor. The U.S., at the urging of allies like Saudi Arabia which are close with the Sharaa government, recently lifted sanctions on Syria. For months, officials of the Trump administration have likewise mediated talks and pushed Israel and Syria to conclude an agreement to stop Israel’s seizures and air campaign. For his part, Sharaa and his negotiators have continually pressed for a halt to Israeli incursions and a return to the 1974 disengagement agreement and the de facto borders it established, describing it as a “necessity.” Hints of common ground on Hezbollah and Iran Aside from Syria’s immediate desire and chief priority to end all hostilities on its territory, there are some potential benefits to a new arrangement with Israel from both countries’ perspective. Before its fall, the Assad government was close to Hezbollah and the Islamic Republic of Iran. Hezbollah , a Lebanese Shia Islamist political party and paramilitary group funded by Iran, supported Assad and played a major role in Syria’s civil war . Furthermore, under Assad’s government, Syria served as a land bridge between Iran and Lebanon through which Hezbollah fighters transported their military equipment, money and drugs . Under Sharaa, Syria’s central government is now closely allied to the Arab Gulf countries that have long been Iran’s regional rivals. In strengthening its security, Syria will no longer serve as Hezbollah-Iran meeting point, which will subsequently benefit Israel. For Syria, it will also stabilize the country against Iranian interference. The risk of Syria’s further fragmentation The risks of a deal with Israel from Syria’s standpoint, however, are significant. In defending its incursions into Syria, Israel has pointed to both the security threat it says Syria poses to Israel and also the situation of minority groups in Syria, where sectarian violence has risen against communities like the Christian Orthodox and the Druze . Israel has floated a number of plans for how it intends to retain a heavy footprint in Syria beyond the occupation of the Golan Heights and the 1974 Agreement of Disengagement. One option on the table is an extension of the historical buffer zone and splitting Syria into autonomous zones, in which Sweidah province would be a demilitarized buffer zone between Israel and Syria. With the most recent idea of a humanitarian corridor couched in the language of protecting Syrian minorities, Israel could be seeking a wider area under more explicit control. From the Syrian perspective, all of the above are backdoor ways by Israel to cement post-Assad military actions beyond the scope of the 1974 truce. As such, agreement to a security pact on Israeli terms would mean jeopardizing or shrinking Syria’s sovereignty and territorial integrity. Syrian protesters gather in front of Damascus Citadel to denounce Israel’s attacks on the Gaza Strip and to oppose any potential agreement that would lead to normalization of relations with Israel. Hasan Belal/Anadolu via Getty Images The Syrian leadership’s challenge going forward After years of war and fragmentation, most Syrians will take any cessation of hostilities with Israel as a welcome development – but not at any cost. Many Syrians are opposed to further fragmentation of the country . And considering the ongoing killing and displacement of Palestinians in Gaza – described recently by a U.N. body as genocide – and Syria’s historic commitment to pan-Arabism, many Syrians will likely be skeptical if a security deal with Israel means a de facto recognition of the land and sovereignty Israel has acquired since December 2024. That points to the major dilemma underpinning Sharaa’s position. Syria is in a vulnerable place and is not in position to negotiate from strength, especially as Sharaa tries to open Syria to the Western world, boost its economy and bring back the civil war refugees from neighboring countries. Seeking to consolidate his government’s hold on power and end the presence of a foreign military, Sharaa likely sees a security agreement as in his immediate interest. While such a pact may bring some stability to Syria and the region, it could also codify Israel’s nearly unchallenged regional power.",https://theconversation.com/for-war-weary-syria-potential-benefits-of-security-pact-with-israel-comes-with-big-risks-265785,Society,BBC,Mireille Rebeiz,https://images.theconversation.com/files/695106/original/file-20251008-66-lfz8kc.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&rect=0%2C30%2C1024%2C512&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop,2025-10-09T17:54:38+00:00,7e92758813fd2f4dae7556e6290e9c1618b5dadf
aeedf9c83add,A Denver MD has spent 2 decades working with hospitalized patients experiencing homelessness − here’s what she fears and what gives her hope,"colorado, denver, doctors, emergency, health, homelessness, hospital, housing, housing first, local, partnerships, safety net, scientists at work, unhoused people","On a recent early fall morning, hope was in short supply. My first patient was a regular. Mr. D was a man in his 50s with diabetes. He had been living on Denver’s streets for most of the past five years, two of them with a walker in tow. Without stable housing and reliable access to insulin, he’d come to the hospital that morning with another limb-threatening infection. I examined the telltale ulceration on the sole of his foot. It had progressed to the underlying bone and would require another amputation. This time he would be dependent on a wheelchair. I asked him about his prospects for housing. He shook his head and said, “Doc, I just keep falling through the cracks.” Mr. D is one of the 10,774 people who experienced homelessness on a single night in 2025 across metro Denver, according to a count conducted by the Metro Denver Homeless Initiative and partner organizations. Of these, 35% were experiencing a chronic form of homelessness. Each year, homeless service organizations count how many people are experiencing homelessness on one night in January. The count helps service providers and government entities understand the trends and needs of people experiencing homelessness. Joe Amon/Denver Post via Getty Images As an internal medicine physician whose focus is caring for hospitalized patients, my experience suggests that this count is too low. People in hospitals and other institutional settings the day of the survey are not reflected in these numbers. Others are hard to spot, staying out of sight on couches or in creek beds, or hiding in plain sight while they serve our food or fix our roads. For these reasons, point-in-time counts underestimate the true prevalence of homelessness in the city. I work at Denver Health , the region’s comprehensive safety net health system, where I’m on the front lines of Denver’s homelessness crisis. My perspectives on this issue have been shaped by nearly two decades of experience caring for some of the city’s most vulnerable patients. I’ve helped create and oversee hospital partnerships that help people like Mr. D find housing. But recent federal actions will only worsen homelessness and weaken the response to it in Colorado and across the nation. Falling through the cracks When people like Mr. D fall through the cracks, my colleagues and I are there to catch them. In 2024, Denver Health served more than 16,000 patients experiencing homelessness who collectively had 78,000 visits to the integrated health system. I’ve watched these cracks widen as Colorado has become one of the least affordable places in the country to live . According to a report by the National Low Income Housing Coalition, in 2025 a Coloradan can work more than 80 hours per week and still be unable to afford a one-bedroom apartment . This means that housing is woefully out of reach for many of my patients. As physicians, we are trained to address the root causes of the diseases we treat. I care for elderly patients who are newly homeless following an eviction, as well as homeless veterans and Lyft drivers who sleep in their vehicles. Though their individual circumstances vary — loss of job or a loved one, an illness or a battle with addiction — the root cause of their homelessness is the same: a lack of affordable and available housing. Because of an increased prevalence of serious health conditions and structural barriers – such as marginalization and discrimination – that prevent equitable access to primary and preventive health care, people experiencing homelessness often rely on hospitals like ours for care. In 2024, roughly 1 in 6 adults admitted to Denver Health’s hospital for an illness or injury were experiencing homelessness, according to internal data. Like Mr. D, many are aging and have cognitive and mobility impairments , along with the frailty characteristic of much older patients. Those living unsheltered suffer preventable harms such as frostbite and heatstroke in Colorado’s climate of extremes. And for many, homelessness is lethal. Last year at least 223 people died while living on Denver’s streets. At Denver Health, homeless adults who are admitted to the hospital stay on average 2.4 days longer than housed patients, translating into 5,400 excess hospital days for Denver residents alone, according to internal data. And without a safe place to recover, they have significantly higher readmission rates. Evidence of the negative impacts of homelessness on health and hospital resources is so compelling that the Center for Medicaid and Medicare Services has recognized homelessness as a comorbid condition . This designation gives homelessness a similar weight to chronic health conditions such as heart disease or diabetes. Seeing the needless suffering brought about by patients’ lack of housing and feeling powerless to stop it also contributes to moral injury among health care providers. Moral injury refers to the psychological and emotional wounds that occur when one witnesses events that violate their moral and ethical beliefs. I’ve certainly recognized these feelings in myself or in colleagues who’ve been at the bedside with me all these years. To me, treating the symptoms of homelessness without addressing the underlying cause feels like treating a gunshot wound with a Band-Aid. Cure for homelessness But unlike many of the conditions I treat, homelessness does have a cure. Simply put, it’s deeply affordable and supportive housing. Evidence shows that Housing First – an approach that prioritizes housing as a critical foundation for engagement in health care services – results in high rates of housing stability and brings down high-cost health care utilization . Roberta Ramirez stays at the Aspen, a noncongregate homelessness shelter in Denver. Hyoung Chang/Denver Post via Getty Images Yet many of the patients I treat, as one of my colleagues likes to say, “will never darken the door of a homeless service agency.” In 2021, only 53% of patients on our health system’s homeless registry were using homeless services in the community. In a cruel irony, the chaos of homelessness that forces people to prioritize survival, combined with health conditions such as physical disabilities, dementia or serious mental illness , often collude to prevent patients from engaging with the very systems that could end their homelessness. Sometimes, like Mr. D, they give up trying. This creates the heartbreaking situations I see in my daily work. Too often the patients with the greatest health care needs and vulnerability are the most underserved. Over time, I’ve learned that improving health inside the hospital walls increasingly means working beyond them to build collaborations to address the myriad ways our systems are failing patients like Mr. D. Housing and health partnerships In Denver some progress has been made. In 2023 Mayor Mike Johnston issued an emergency declaration on homelessness . He subsequently enacted All in Mile High , a citywide strategy to address street homelessness. Through the collaborative efforts of the city and partnering agencies, on Aug. 27,2025, Denver announced a 45% reduction in unsheltered homelessness between January 2023 and January 2025. Denver Health has aided these efforts by investing in strategic partnerships that provide alternatives to discharging hospitalized patients back to the streets . The Renaissance Legacy Lofts and John Parvensky Stout Street Recuperative Care Center in Denver offer medical respite and permanent supportive housing for people experiencing homelessness. Hyoung Chang/Denver Post via Getty Images Since 2023, Denver Health has discharged roughly 700 patients into medical respite beds through a partnership with the Colorado Coalition for the Homeless . The hospital helps fund a portion of beds at the John Parvensky Stout Street Recuperative Care Center to provide patients who are too ill or frail to recover in shelters or on the streets with a safe place and the right support to heal . In another effort to offer housing to at-risk patients, the hospital system sold its former administration building to the Denver Housing Authority , which then redeveloped the property. The hospital now leases 14 apartments that it makes available to provide temporary housing and case management to elderly or disabled patients experiencing homelessness following a hospitalization. Most of the 39 patients who have been housed there have attained more permanent housing, according to internal data. A 9News report on the office building converted into affordable housing in Denver. Denver Health also partners on Denver’s Housing to Health Program , a permanent supportive housing program launched in 2022 that aims to reduce health care expenditures for people experiencing chronic homelessness. A hospital team identifies eligible patients and provides “warm handoffs” to directly connect them with the program’s housing service providers during hospitalizations or emergency room visits. While the evaluation is ongoing, it’s a promising partnership model for how hospitals might collaborate to address homelessness. Impact of federal policies and funding cuts With accompanying investments in proven solutions to homelessness, such partnerships have the potential to deliver better care at lower cost. Actions taken by the federal government in 2025 that criminalize people experiencing homelessness, defund Housing First initiatives and dismantle Medicaid and other essential benefits threaten these partnerships and our progress. These policies will worsen homelessness, and patients will continue to be “housed” in the least appropriate and most expensive way – in the hospital. In addition to harming patients, this trend is not sustainable for safety net hospitals like Denver Health that already provide millions of dollars annually in uncompensated care . As a physician working at the intersection of housing and health, I believe hospitals are key partners in the fight to end homelessness. I’ve observed the hopelessness that homelessness can bring. But I’ve also seen how the right partnerships can transform a routine hospitalization into an unexpected opportunity for meaningful connection that puts patients on the path to housing and health. Now when I see patients like Mr. D, I see possibility rather than another dead end for them. After all, for all their adversity, my patients’ stories are also stories of beauty, strength and resilience. While the “cracks” keep me up at night, their stories, and the partnerships we’ve created, bring me hope at a time when hope seems in short supply.

78aa01c0b229,"Refinery fires, other chemical disasters may no longer get safety investigations","chemical industry, chemicals, chevron, energy, hazardous materials, national transportation safety board, osha, oil industry, risk management, us environmental protection agency","When fire erupted at the Intercontinental Terminals Co. bulk liquid petroleum storage terminal, large plumes of dark smoke billowed into the clear skies over Deer Park, Texas. Despite the efforts of site staff and local firefighters, more than 70 million gallons of petroleum products burned or were otherwise released into the environment over the following three days in March 2019. Even while the fire was still burning, investigations began looking into what had happened and what was still happening. The Environmental Protection Agency tested air and water samples to determine how much pollution was being released – both to determine cleanup efforts and to assess fines . The Occupational Safety and Health Administration reviewed what had happened, but found that with no workers injured, there was no reason to investigate further or impose fines or other penalties on the company. A third federal agency, the Chemical Safety and Hazard Investigation Board, often known as the CSB, got to work figuring out what had gone wrong, without assigning legal or financial responsibility, but rather seeking to learn from this disaster how to prevent future accidents . It’s an approach much like the National Transportation Safety Board takes toward airplane crashes, train derailments and other transportation-related tragedies: document what happened and identify every opportunity to prevent or reduce the chances of it happening again . That deep investigative process reportedly will not happen in the wake of the October 2025 explosion and fire at a Chevron refinery in El Segundo, California, because of the federal government shutdown and lack of funding for the organization. As scholars of chemical disasters , we believe this absence – and the potential for the board to be eliminated entirely under the proposed 2026 federal budget – raises the risk of more, and more serious, chemical disasters, not just in the U.S. but around the world. A fire burns at Intercontinental Terminals Co. in Deer Park, Texas, in March 2019. AP Photo/David J. Phillip Many serious incidents The CSB investigation of that 2019 fire that burned 15 petroleum tanks at the Intercontinental Terminals Co., near the Port of Houston, yielded key recommendations to the company, OSHA and the EPA. They included necessary updates to safety management systems, the need for flammable-gas detectors to identify leaks , and remotely operated emergency shutoff valves so workers could close tanks containing hazardous material without exposing themselves to danger. The company has addressed the first recommendation and is reportedly working on the next two . The board also recommended to the petroleum industry that storage tanks be spaced farther apart so they would be less likely to catch each other on fire – a recommendation that is still under review. And the Texas fire was just one of several disasters the Chemical Safety and Hazard Investigation Board investigated that year. Since its activation in 1998, the board has conducted in-depth investigations of 102 chemical disasters in the chemical and industrial sectors – an average of about four per year. And its reports are regularly used worldwide, including in France, South Korea and China . A U.S. Chemical Safety and Hazard Investigation Board video summarizes the agency’s findings about a March 2019 petrochemical terminal fire in Texas. Creation and goals of the CSB The U.S. Chemical Safety and Hazard Investigation Board was created by Congress in a 1990 amendment to the Clean Air Act, in the wake of several high-profile chemical disasters around the world. Those included the 1976 dioxin release in Seveso, Italy , which caused skin lesions on over 600 people and contaminated nearly 7 square miles of land; the deaths of thousands in Bhopal, India, from the 1984 release of methyl isocyanate from a Union Carbide pesticide plant; and the Chernobyl nuclear plant disaster in 1986 in what was then the Soviet Union. The goal was to prevent similar accidents from occurring on U.S. soil by investigating the causes of incidents and providing recommendations for improvement. Specifically designed to be independent of other organizations and political influence , the CSB cannot be forced to modify its findings by other agencies, branches or political parties, ensuring its impartiality. It has no power to issue regulations, nor any authority to impose fines or other punishments for wrongdoing. Rather, it is a fact-finding, investigative body designed to learn from past disasters and issue voluntary recommendations so chemical companies can improve their equipment and processes to prevent future tragedies. The vast majority of its recommendations are adopted by the industries affected , usually by the investigated company, though sometimes recommendations become industry standards. These recommendations can range from changes in procedure, the addition of safety devices or even overall facility design recommendations. What does the board do? There are several kinds of events companies must report to the federal government, including deaths and releases of particular chemicals , such as chlorine, naphthalene and vinyl chloride. The board reviews those reports and decides on its own which to investigate. When an inquiry is opened, a group of experts who work for the board travel to the incident site to gather evidence to understand not only what happened in the big picture but a detailed view of how events unfolded. After the investigation, the board issues a report detailing what it found and recommending specific changes to the company to reduce the risk of that sequence of events happening again. The board also delivers its information to other federal agencies, such as the EPA and OSHA, which can determine whether changes would be appropriate to federal regulations that apply to all companies in an industry. The board’s value The board had a US$14 million annual budget for 2025, which is a tiny part of the more than $6 trillion the U.S. government spends each year. The current administration’s justification for eliminating the CSB is that its capabilities are duplicated by agencies such as the EPA and OSHA . But the EPA focuses specifically on environmental violations and potential threats to human life. OSHA investigates regulatory violations leading to personal injury. In fact, the CSB has helped the EPA and OSHA evaluate and improve regulations , such as for the open burning of waste explosives , and improved methods of investigating accidental chemical releases and implementing new emergency response rules . The CSB is the only organization that looks into improving processes to prevent future accidents instead of punishing past acts. It’s the difference between investigating who robbed a bank to hold the robbers accountable and improving bank security so another robbery can’t occur.",https://theconversation.com/refinery-fires-other-chemical-disasters-may-no-longer-get-safety-investigations-265546,Society,BBC,Philip Steenstra,https://images.theconversation.com/files/694944/original/file-20251007-56-d601ug.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&rect=0%2C324%2C5272%2C2636&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop,2025-10-09T12:42:51+00:00,9f730328a6fd212492b877f042a49e2983fae8ba
2808aa764f46,"In 1776, Thomas Paine made the best case for fighting kings − and for being skeptical","american revolution, common sense, founders, freedom, monarchy, rule of law, thomas paine, tyrants","In one of his stand-up sets, comedian David Cross rejects all political commentary that tries to answer the question, “What would America’s Founding Fathers think if they were alive today?” For Cross, it is pointless to speculate about the present-day views of men who could not have imagined cotton candy, let alone the machine that makes it. “What’s a machine? What’s a machine???” he screams in their collective voice, recoiling from the sorcery of the state fair. The first time I saw this bit, something odd happened. Having just read the 1776 political pamphlet “Common Sense,” I could hear its author, one of America’s founders , laughing louder than anybody. That would be Thomas Paine, the man credited with turning the American Revolution from a complicated Colonial fracas into a titanic struggle for the soul of liberty itself . If Cross is skeptical that anything 250 years old still holds up, Paine, were he alive today, could probably name one thing: skepticism. Ways of thinking and being do not grow out of the ground; we make them ourselves, then hand them down as best we can. Paine would smile to see his favorite heirloom, the skeptical worldview, still intact. Saying “no” – especially to those in power – is an underrated American pastime , and Paine was its Babe Ruth. If you plan on joining No Kings rallies and have yet to find a slogan for your sign, Paine’s got you covered: “In America, the law is king!” “No King! No Tyranny!” “Monarchy hath poisoned the republic.” I could go on. Because he did. Published in 1776, Thomas Paine’s pamphlet ‘Common Sense’ inveighed against monarchy and hereditary privilege and in favor of independence for the Colonies. Smithsonian National Museum of American History Birth of a revolutionary Where did all this anti-monarchical fire come from? Originally, from a small town in Norfolk, England, in 1737 . Turning from his father’s trade of corset-making, Paine tried his hand at business, met and impressed Benjamin Franklin in London , sailed to America, and there found his true metier as a pamphleteer and radical. Using simple yet incandescent prose, Paine renounced, repudiated and ridiculed at a clip seldom witnessed in print before or since. Hereditary privilege, colonialism , the supernatural : no, no, no. But what Paine made his name lambasting – what he knocked out of the park with almost steroidal force – were kings . All of them, from the figures of ancient legend and Scripture to those who warmed England’s throne during his lifetime. “ Common Sense,” his first major work , was an urgent wake-up call to every light-sleeping lover of liberty within earshot. In that pamphlet, Paine labels kingship “the most prosperous invention the Devil ever set on foot for the promotion of idolatry.” He never minced words; he wanted the right people to choke on them. Thomas Paine quotes in Lexington, Mass., not far from where the American Revolution began. Photo: Joel Abrams , CC BY ‘Simple facts, plain arguments’ Exactly what was Paine’s problem with kings? The same problem you’ll have, “Common Sense” promises, when you examine the evidence. This is partly the secret of Paine’s rhetorical power: It’s hard to imagine any wordsmith demanding more vigorously that you not take his word for it. Paine was a student of history, and history is chock-full of receipts. It shows that abuses of kingly power extend back to the “early ages of monarchy,” when some “principal ruffian” first took power, and “it was very easy, after the lapse of a few generations, to trump up some superstitious tale, conveniently timed … to cram hereditary right down the throats of the vulgar.” Since that time, says Paine, even those fortunate enough to live under benevolent rule have seldom been more than one generation away from yet another dreadful monarch. “One of the strongest NATURAL proofs of the folly of hereditary right in kings, is, that nature disapproves it, otherwise she would not so frequently turn it into ridicule by giving mankind an ASS FOR A LION.” What a tweet this would have made, caps and all. Bring the Paine The only thing Paine liked less than monarchical rule was its enablers, anyone who relinquished their freedom willingly to an aspiring tyrant. This is not only wrong, Paine insists, but against nature, since all of us are created equal. A somewhat puckish-looking Thomas Paine – with the wrong first name and a different spelling of his last one. National Portrait Gallery, Smithsonian Institution But even that’s not the worst part. Those who sacrifice their own freedom on the altar of monarchy also sacrifice that of future generations. Their “unwise, unjust, unnatural compact might (perhaps) in the next succession put them under the government of a rogue or a fool.” Ouch. “Most wise men,” Paine adds, “in their private sentiments, have ever treated hereditary right with contempt; yet it is one of those evils, which when once established is not easily removed; many submit from fear, others from superstition, and the more powerful part shares with the king the plunder of the rest.” Federal worker firings , court settlements , a government shutdown . Paine would loathe how right the U.S. is proving him. Besides criticizing both tradition and manipulative elites for their role in abetting monarchs, Paine’s writing gestures toward a more widely accessible sense of false freedom that comes with getting what you want from whoever happens to wear the crown. This kind of pleasure obscures a painful reality: that the tyrant can strike as well as stroke. The problem of unchecked power is not nearly counterbalanced by any number of indulgences the wielder of that power deigns to bestow. Freedom, Paine insists, is not transactional; whatever price you name, you’re getting fleeced. Or, to put it his way: “O ye that love mankind! Ye that dare oppose, not only the tyranny, but the tyrant, stand forth!”",https://theconversation.com/in-1776-thomas-paine-made-the-best-case-for-fighting-kings-and-for-being-skeptical-266448,Society,BBC,Matthew Redmond,https://images.theconversation.com/files/694886/original/file-20251007-56-n8agt7.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&rect=0%2C50%2C6000%2C3000&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop,2025-10-09T12:42:17+00:00,552b4f81a474fa2619f3d703553df2b4e34aa5f9
37f6d1845efb,Gaza peace plan risks borrowing more from Tony Blair’s failures in the Middle East than his success in Northern Ireland,"benjamin netanyahu, diplomacy, donald trump, gaza, good friday agreement, hamas, israel, israeli-palestinian conflict, middle east, middle east peace plan, middle east peace process, oslo accords, palestine, palestinians, quartet, tony blair, us-middle east","Tony Blair, the man being tapped by U.S. President Donald Trump to help oversee governance of a postwar Gaza, has ample experience with peace processes. As British prime minister, Blair helped usher through the 1998 Good Friday Agreement that did much to end decades of sectarian violence in Northern Ireland. After leaving office, he was also special envoy to the so-called Quartet – a diplomatic effort to find a lasting solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. As Hamas’ Oct. 7, 2023, attack on Israel and the subsequent devastation in Gaza, described recently as genocide by a U.N. body , make clear, that attempt failed. The 20-point peace plan that negotiators are currently discussing in Egypt is light on details. But it outlines the return of the remaining Israeli hostages held by Hamas, the demilitarization of the Gaza Strip and the creation of an international security force to operate on the ground. Notably, the plan does not support the removal of Palestinians from Gaza – something that was present in previous proposals by the Trump administration and which human rights advocates noted amounts to ethnic cleansing . On Oct. 8, 2025, Trump announced that an initial phase involving the exchange of hostages for prisoners and a pause in fighting had been agreed upon. But negotiations continue on sticking points, including the disarming of the militant group. Among other things, the deal also provisions a postwar Gaza governed by an interim “technocratic” and “apolitical” Palestinian committee. This temporary body will be overseen by a “ Board of Peace ” run by Trump himself. Other unspecified members will be added, but the only one mentioned in the proposals is Blair, who according to reports had been in talks with the Trump administration for some time crafting the current peace plan. As a scholar of international relations and Palestinian politics , I fear the proposal contains the same limitations and failings that plagued previous peace plans pushed on Palestinians from outside bodies – including both Blair’s Quartet efforts and the earlier Oslo Accords – and too little of what made Northern Ireland peace stick. A plan rooted in ‘illiberal peace’ The biggest shortcoming critics find with the current plan is that it does nothing to definitively address the right of Palestinians to self-determination and sovereignty – a right enshrined in international law. Nor does the plan include any meaningful Palestinian input, either through legitimate representatives of the Palestinian people or through mechanisms to ensure the Palestinian public’s buy-in. Instead, the new framework is asymmetric, providing the Israeli government many of its political objectives while imposing multiple layers of international control on and vague assurances to the Palestinian people – and only if they comply. As such, the plan continues the trend of what political scientists describe as “illiberal peace” in conflict resolution. In a 2018 paper, scholars described an “illiberal peace ” as one in which “cessation of armed conflict is achieved in ways that are … unashamedly authoritarian.” Such a peace is achieved through “methods that eschew genuine negotiations among parties to the conflict, reject international mediation and constraints on the use of force, disregard calls to address underlying structural causes of conflict, and instead rely on instruments of state coercion and hierarchical structures of power.” Past examples include conflict management in the Kurdish region of Turkey , Chechnya under Russian control and the ethnic cleansing of Nagorno-Karabakh . From left, Irish Prime Minister Bertie Ahern, U.S. Sen. George Mitchell and British Prime Minister Tony Blair pose together after signing the Good Friday Agreement on April 10, 1998. Dan Chung/Pool Photo via AP, File The Northern Ireland case study That stands in contrast to peace agreements that have succeeded elsewhere using more inclusive diplomatic frameworks, like in Northern Ireland . For 30-plus years, the territory was engulfed in sectarian violence between the mainly Protestant “loyalists” who wanted to remain part of the U.K. and the Catholic minority that wished to be part of a united, independent Irish republic. To end this armed conflict, the peace process included all relevant parties, including militant groups on all sides. The Northern Ireland peace process also explicitly engaged with the Irish public and offered the people input through two separate referendum votes . People in Northern Ireland voted on whether to support the plan, and people in the Republic of Ireland voted on whether to authorize the Irish state to sign the agreement. This inclusive and democratic process has been able to sustain a cessation of conflict for the past 27 years. While Blair didn’t start the Northern Ireland peace process, his government played a pivotal role, and it was he who memorably noted “ the hand of history ” on the shoulder of those involved in the final days of negotiation. A failed Oslo counterexample The Northern Ireland process stands in direct contrast to many of the failed peace processes attempted in the Middle East, which fall more in line with the “illiberal peace” concept. The most serious push for lasting peace was the Oslo Accords in 1993 , in which the Palestine Liberation Organization accepted Israel’s right to exist, forgoing its claims to much of historic Palestine, in return for Israel’s acknowledgment of the PLO as the legitimate representative of the Palestinian people. That process led to the creation of the Palestinian Authority, which was meant to exercise limited governance on an interim basis, and presidential and parliamentary elections in order to facilitate the input of the Palestinian public. But as many former U.S. officials have since admitted, the accords were asymmetric : They offered Palestinians recognition under the PLO but little pathway to achieve a negotiated solution under conditions of occupation by a far more powerful sovereign country. U.S. President Bill Clinton applauds as Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, left, and Palestine Liberation Organization Chairman Yasser Arafat look on after the signing of the Oslo Accords in 1993. AP Photo/Dennis Cook That peace process fell apart when that asymmetry became clear. The two parties meant very different things when they used the word “state.” The Israel government envisioned some form of limited self-governance for the Palestinians and continued its settlement expansion and military occupation. The Palestinians, on the other hand, envisioned a legitimate state exercising sovereignty. Adding to the problems, Palestinians never had equal negotiating power, and the accords lacked a neutral arbiter in the U.S., the leading mediator. Oslo was intended to be a time-limited process to give negotiators space to resolve outstanding conflict issues. In practice, it served to give long-term diplomatic cover for a status quo in which Israeli governments moved away from a two-state solution while Palestinians became more politically and geographically fragmented under worsening hardship and violence . The Oslo peace process fell apart in the early years of Blair’s government, at the same time as he was helping put the finishing touches on the Good Friday Agreement. The necessity of public buy-in and an inclusive process was evident to many onlookers to the divergent fortunes of both peace processes. Repeating failed lessons in Gaza? In the Israeli-Palestinian context today, Blair risks repeating the mistakes of Oslo. He is poised to sit on an undemocratic international body overseeing a people under a de facto military occupation. As a representative for the Quartet, Tony Blair waves to the media in front of Palestinian officials in Ramallah in the West Bank in 2012. AP Photo/Majdi Mohammed Further, while the Trump plan is reliant on Hamas’ approval, there is no role for the group after the initial stage. In fact, the framework explicitly states that Hamas must be excised from any future discussions of postwar Gaza. Moreover, no other Palestinian group has any direct involvement; Hamas’ main rival Fatah – the party that is in control of the Palestinian Authority in the occupied West Bank – is only briefly mentioned. As for that Palestinian Authority, there is only a vague line about reforming the body. Similarly, there has been no mention of what the Palestinian people might actually want. In this way, the body being proposed recalls the creation of the U.S.-led Coalition Provisional Authority during the invasion of Iraq. That body governed Iraq immediately following the invasion and was criticized for corruption and lack of transparency . The failure of the Iraq War, and the U.K.’s involvement in it, contributed to Blair’s resignation as prime minister in 2007, after which he took on the role of special envoy to the Quartet . Led by the U.N., U.S., EU and Russia, the Quartet was tasked with preserving some form of the two-state solution and implementing economic development plans in Palestinian cities. But it, too, failed to address the changing political realities on the ground as Israeli settlements expanded and the military occupation deepened. The underlying assumption about the Quartet, critics contend, is that it largely ignored the Palestinian right to self-determination and sovereignty; rather, it focused on marginally improving economic conditions and Band-Aid initiatives. The latest U.S.-backed proposal cribs heavily from the approach. Even if it does bring about a welcome respite from the suffering in Gaza in the short term, I believe a durable, mutually agreed upon resolution to the decades-long Israeli-Palestinian conflict requires what Trump’s plan sidelines: Palestinian self-determination. In Northern Ireland, Blair once understood the importance of neutral mediation and the buy-in of all parties to the conflict and the people themselves. The plan he is involved with now appears to be operating with a far different calculus.",https://theconversation.com/gaza-peace-plan-risks-borrowing-more-from-tony-blairs-failures-in-the-middle-east-than-his-success-in-northern-ireland-266742,Society,BBC,Dana El Kurd,https://images.theconversation.com/files/695093/original/file-20251008-66-43dcp7.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&rect=0%2C131%2C1024%2C512&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop,2025-10-09T12:40:47+00:00,20989b218fd1ed8c5f0cc299d1df08b54e06e102
f0e8a58138ca,Metal-organicframeworks:Nobel-winningtiny ‘sponge crystals’ with an astonishing amount of inner space,"carbon capture, chemistry, energy, environment, materials, materials science, nobel prize, nobel prize 2025, nobel prize in chemistry","The 2025 Nobel Prize in chemistry was awarded to Richard Robson, Susumu Kitagawa and Omar Yaghi on Oct. 8, 2025, for the development of metal-organic frameworks, or MOFs , which are tunable crystal structures with extremely high porosity. These are a class of materials that have truly changed the way scientists design and think about matter, inspiring progress in various applications. I’m a MOF scientist and for many of us in the field, this recognition feels both historic and deeply personal. MOFs are not just elegant crystals you’d admire under a microscope; they’re an entire universe of structures, each like a miniature city of tunnels and rooms waiting to be filled. They’ve been my scientific home since I first stepped into research, and they still feel a little bit like magic to me. So, what exactly are MOFs? Metal-organic frameworks are like crystalline scaffolds built from two ingredients: metals that act like connective joints and organic – that is, carbon-based – molecules that behave as bridges to link those joints in a repeating pattern. The result is a highly ordered, porous framework – a kind of molecular architecture that’s both sturdy and full of empty space. Metal-organic frameworks, shown in this model, can trap smaller molecules inside their larger frame. Jonathan Nackstrand/AFP via Getty Images These frameworks are so porous, like sponges with tiny voids, that it’s almost impossible to picture them. One gram of a MOF has so many pores that it can expose as much internal surface area as a soccer field . It’s astonishing that a handful of powder could hide an entire landscape of surface within it. That enormous surface area is one of the unique things that make MOFs so powerful, and it comes from the nanoscale pores – tiny molecular rooms that can trap, separate, transform or transport gases, ions and other molecules. In a way, MOFs are like molecular hotels with countless doors, each programmed to admit only certain guests. Why scientists love them What fascinates me most about metal-organic frameworks is their limitless design space. Just by glancing at the periodic table, every metal could, in principle, serve as a cornerstone, and countless organic molecules can act as bridges connecting them. Even using the same combination can produce entirely different architectures. Chemist Omar Farha compares metal-organic frameworks to Lego sets that you can build and customize. So far, scientists have synthesized over 90,000 MOFs , and computational chemists have predicted hundreds of thousands more. Few material families offer this much versatility. I like to think of MOFs as puzzles or Lego sets, but on the atomic scale. You can replace a single piece, or change its color or shape, and end up with a material that behaves completely differently. Add a new “decoration” – what chemists call a functional group – and the framework suddenly recognizes a new molecule. Stretch the organic bridges, and the same architecture inflates like a balloon, giving what we call isoreticular MOFs . These have the same structure, but bigger pores. In short, MOFs can come in almost every imaginable shape, size and texture. Pushing the boundaries of these materials Beyond their scientific elegance, MOFs are incredibly promising for real-world technologies. Different structures and functionalities lead to different properties and, therefore, different uses. Some MOFs act as molecular sieves, selectively capturing carbon dioxide from industrial exhaust or even directly from air. Others clean polluted water by removing heavy metals, dyes or “ forever chemicals .” Certain MOFs can also carry drugs or imaging agents inside the body for medical applications . In the energy world, they function as electrodes or electrolytes that make batteries safer and more efficient. And many serve as catalysts , accelerating chemical reactions that transform one molecule into another. When I began my Ph.D., my senior colleagues warned me that MOFs might be too delicate – beautiful crystals that would crumble at the first hint of air or moisture. And indeed, some of the early frameworks were fragile curiosities, admired more for their elegance than their endurance. But that perception has changed dramatically. Metal-organic frameworks, like MOF-5 shown here, have metal components, organic ‘linkers’ and a cavity which can allow in gases. Tony Boehle/Wikimedia Commons , CC BY-SA Many MOFs are now remarkably robust. The material I first worked on was a titanium-based metal-organic framework named MIL-125 . It was first reported by Gérard Férey, one of the foundational figures in the MOF and porous framework community who sadly died in 2017. MIL-125 was not only stable, it was practically indestructible in my lab. After synthesizing two grams of it, I stored it on my bench in an open vial and used that same batch for every catalytic experiment throughout my Ph.D. No glovebox, no desiccator – just a jar of yellow powder sitting happily on my bench. That experience taught me something important: While stability can be a legitimate concern, MOFs have grown up. Thanks to smart chemistry, we have materials that can withstand water, heat and repeated use . Since their foundation, researchers around the world have introduced new properties to these materials – from electrical conductivity to light responsiveness – and, crucially, made major progress in scaling up MOF synthesis for industrial applications. Scaling is the key step in bridging the gap between fundamental discovery and large-scale deployment. Researchers are no longer content with studying MOFs in milligrams – we’re often planning for grams, kilograms and beyond. Some startups are turning these advances into real technologies – from storing gases more safely, to pulling clean water straight from desert air , to building more energy-efficient air conditioners . What once felt like science fiction – powders that breathe, trap and transform molecules – is now science fact. Despite these advances, researchers will need to continue improving the stability and scalability of MOFs to fully realize these materials’ potential in the real world. A Nobel moment that honors creativity The 2025 Nobel Prize in chemistry goes beyond honoring three remarkable scientists – it celebrates an entire community: a generation of chemists and engineers who transformed a single idea into a thriving field. The pioneering visions of Richard Robson, Susumu Kitagawa and Omar Yaghi laid the foundations for a vibrant discipline that has grown to encompass everything from gas storage and catalysis to energy and environmental technologies. When I attended my first MOF conference as a second-year Ph.D. student, I listened in awe to many of the pioneers of this field, some of whom are now Nobel laureates. Back then, MOFs felt like magical sponges, and that sense of wonder never left me. It led me to continue my research on conductive MOFs: materials that can carry electricity. Now, in my own research group , we study how these frameworks can make batteries safer and more efficient, and how they can capture waste gases and turn them into useful chemicals using sunlight. For me, this Nobel Prize celebrates more than a discovery, it celebrates a philosophy: Chemistry is creative, we can design and engineer matter with imagination, and sometimes emptiness can be the very essence of a material.",https://theconversation.com/metal-organic-frameworks-nobel-winning-tiny-sponge-crystals-with-an-astonishing-amount-of-inner-space-267089,Society,BBC,Stavroula Alina Kampouri,https://images.theconversation.com/files/695223/original/file-20251008-64-gg29g9.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&rect=0%2C0%2C5681%2C2840&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop,2025-10-09T01:57:46+00:00,73a5c570d7d0415acee2bef659f20ba14193de80
3823472ef4fd,Nobel Prize in physics awarded for ultracold electronics research that launched a quantum technology,"nobel prize, nobel prize 2025, physics, quantum computing, quantum physics, quantum sensors, qubits, superconductivity, technology","Quantum mechanics describes the weird behavior of microscopic particles. Using quantum systems to perform computation promises to allow researchers to solve problems in areas from chemistry to cryptography that have so many possible solutions that they are beyond the capabilities of even the most powerful nonquantum computers possible. Quantum computing depends on researchers developing practical quantum technologies. Superconducting electrical circuits are a promising technology, but not so long ago it was unclear whether they even showed quantum behavior. The 2025 Nobel Prize in physics was awarded to three scientists for their work demonstrating that quantum effects persist even in large electrical circuits, which has enabled the development of practical quantum technologies. I’m a physicist who studies superconducting circuits for quantum computing and other uses. The work in my field stems from the groundbreaking research the Nobel laureates conducted. Big, cold, quantum In their 1984 and 1985 work, then-Ph.D. student John Martinis , then-postdoctoral researcher Michel Devoret and UC Berkeley professor John Clarke showed that even large electrical circuits could exhibit quantum behavior. They used a circuit made from niobium and lead. When cooled to a few degrees above absolute zero, these metals become superconductors . A superconductor is a material that carries a current without generating any heat. Martinis, Devoret and Clarke showed that in a superconductor, the voltages and currents are governed by quantum mechanics. The circuit has quantized – meaning discrete and indivisible – levels of energy, and it can be in superpositions of multiple states. Any physical system can be described by a state, which tells you everything there is to know about that system. Quantum mechanics shows that a state can have certain quantized values of things that can be measured. An example is energy: A particular system could have energy 1 or energy 2, but nothing in between. At the same time, a quantum system can be in a superposition of more than one state, much like you can add different amounts of red/green/blue to get any color in a pixel of an image. Importantly, the laureates showed that researchers can describe one of these superconducting circuits as if it’s a single quantum particle. This simple behavior is what makes superconducting circuits so useful as a technology. Dilution refrigerators like this chill their contents to near-absolute zero. U.S. Air Force Research Laboratory Today, superconducting circuits are used to study fundamental quantum physics, to simulate other physical systems and to test protocols for ultraprecise sensing. For instance, the Devoret group recently demonstrated a near-ideal microwave amplifier based on a superconducting circuit. Microwave amplifiers are widely used in communications, radar and scientific instruments. The Martinis group has used superconducting circuits to emulate a group of electron-like particles . This type of simulation is a key technique in studying fundamental physics. In my own group, we recently used a superconducting circuit to demonstrate a protocol for measuring a magnetic field more sensitively than standard techniques. Quantum sensors measure physical quantities with extreme precision, from biological activity to gravity anomalies. But by far the biggest application of superconducting circuits is as a platform for quantum computing. Superconducting quantum computers Multiple quantum systems can interact with each other and become entangled , so that they act like a single system. This combination of quantization, superposition and entanglement is what gives quantum computers their power. In quantum computing technology, researchers use a quantum system – a quantum bit or qubit – that can be in only two states. Qubits need to be coherent. This means that if we put it in a particular state, we want it to stay there and not get randomly scrambled to another state. Qubits need to be controllable. This means that researchers should be able to get a qubit to change state as needed and get it to interact with other qubits. And qubits need to be scalable, meaning that we need to make a lot of them. Many technologies show promise, such as arrays of atoms in a vacuum, trapped ions, trapped electrons in seminconductors, and photons controlled by optical circuits. But all technologies make trade-offs, sacrificing coherence, controllability or scalability to improve something else. The simplicity and flexibility of superconducting circuits mean that by changing the design of the circuit, researchers can get almost any qubit behavior we want, and that behavior is easy to predict. This hits the technological sweet spot for quantum computing. More obviously quantum technologies, such as trapped atoms, are so small that they can be hard to control and interact with. Superconducting qubits are big enough to be easy to control, simple enough to be reliable and quantum enough to make the whole thing work. Today, academic research groups like mine develop new types of superconducting qubits, look for ways to make them more coherent, try to improve our control of them, and develop techniques to make them easier to scale up. Companies and government labs take these academic results along with their own basic research and apply them, doing the difficult engineering to create large-scale quantum processors for practical use. Superconductor pioneers Unsurprisingly, the Nobel laureates made and continue to make huge contributions beyond their work in the 1980s. In addition to their academic work, Martinis formerly headed the Google quantum processor effort and now has his own company , while Devoret now assists with the Google effort. Clarke, now retired, also did much of his late-career work on quantum circuits. And they have had major impacts on my career and on so many others. I had the privilege to do a panel discussion with Devoret on May 22, 2025. He made a memorable claim: Picking an academic adviser can be even more of a big deal than picking a spouse, because “you can’t divorce your adviser.” It’s often joked that half the researchers in the field of quantum superconductors can trace an academic lineage to Clarke. I can do it twice: My Ph.D. adviser, Irfan Siddiqi, was advised by Devoret, and Clarke was my secondary adviser. And one of my proudest accomplishments as a grad student was not panicking when Martinis snagged me after I gave a talk to grill me on the details. Today they are honored for their work, and tomorrow I and the other researchers they trained will do our best to continue it.",https://theconversation.com/nobel-prize-in-physics-awarded-for-ultracold-electronics-research-that-launched-a-quantum-technology-266979,Society,BBC,Eli Levenson-Falk,https://images.theconversation.com/files/695204/original/file-20251008-56-mb44vi.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&rect=0%2C0%2C1942%2C971&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop,2025-10-08T19:24:00+00:00,e68c48ffa35d9e2f5ac30ed8e0271945549ce001
6541ee3991e5,"For Trump’s perceived enemies, the process may be the punishment","adam schiff, donald trump, indictment, james comey, letitia james, pam bondi, prosecution, us department of justice, legal fees","Former FBI Director James Comey pleaded not guilty to two criminal charges in a federal court in Alexandria, Virginia, on Oct. 8, 2025. The charges allege that Comey lied to Congress in September 2020 when he stood by earlier testimony that he did not authorize a leak of an FBI investigation involving Hillary Clinton . Numerous legal commentators on both the left and right have argued that Comey’s indictment is little more than the Trump administration seeking vengeance on one of the president’s perceived enemies. They allege that the president has it out for Comey, who investigated Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election and was fired by Trump in 2017. The president’s own words support the idea that the Trump administration is targeting Comey. In a social media post on Sept. 20, 2025, Trump directed Attorney General Pam Bondi to move forward with prosecutions against Comey, Democratic U.S. Sen. Adam Schiff and New York Attorney General Letitia James: “They’re all guilty as hell, but nothing is going to be done. …JUSTICE MUST BE SERVED, NOW!!!” If the case against Comey is exceedingly weak – and little more than a political prosecution – then, in my view as a scholar of the U.S. legal system , it should result in the dismissal of charges by the judge or a not guilty verdict by the jury. But even when an individual is not convicted, the process of defending against charges can itself be a form of punishment , as renowned legal scholar Malcolm Feeley pointed out almost 50 years ago. Here’s how the criminal justice process punishes even innocent people. When you’re prosecuted by the government, it can upend your life. NurPhoto via Getty Images The criminal justice process The criminal justice process is complex . After a grand jury returns an indictment at the request of a prosecutor, the accused appears in court for their arraignment . They are informed of the charges against them and typically enter a plea . During what’s called “ discovery ,” the prosecution and defense investigate the evidence the other side plans to rely on. There are also pretrial motions in which the parties ask judges to dismiss charges and accept or exclude evidence. The defense and prosecution may also meet to discuss a plea bargain , wherein the accused may plead guilty in exchange for a lesser sentence or reduced charges. If there is no plea bargain, then the case moves to trial, which is itself a complicated process . If a defendant is found guilty, they can mount an appeal to higher courts in an attempt to have their conviction overturned. To help navigate this process, criminal defendants typically hire a lawyer. And good lawyers don’t come cheap. Money and time Indigent defendants , who do not have the financial resources to pay their own legal fees, can rely on public defenders paid for by the government. But individuals who can afford to pay for their own lawyer face a substantial financial burden for attorney services and court fees . An experienced criminal defense lawyer can charge more than US$1,000 per hour , with fees quickly adding up. This means that mounting a legal defense can easily cost tens of thousands of dollars. On top of this, it takes a great deal of time to prepare for a criminal case. While lawyers and their staff do much of the legwork for trial preparation, a client works with their attorneys to help formulate a defense. As a result, criminal defendants lose one of the most precious commodities in the world : their time. And this time can come at a tangible cost in the form of lost wages, which harms their day-to-day lives. Put simply, every hour spent preparing for trial is an hour defendants could spend working or enjoying their lives. Patrice Failor, center, wife of former FBI Director James Comey, is embraced by daughters Claire Comey, left, and Maurene Comey at the courthouse in Alexandria, Va., where James Comey was arraigned and pleaded not guilty on Oct. 8, 2025. Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images Stress and embarrassment It’s not pleasant being charged with a crime. The criminal process, which typically lasts months , takes a toll on one’s mental health . This is largely driven by the uncertainty surrounding the outcome of a criminal trial and the possibility of losing one’s freedom if convicted. In addition, there is a social stigma that comes with being accused of a crime. This can result in reputational damage, anxiety and embarrassment. The Trump administration appears to recognize this reality. Several media outlets have reported that FBI leadership had planned a public perp walk for Comey. According to a CBS News report , this was to have included “‘large, beefy’ agents … ‘in full kit,’ including Kevlar vests and exterior wear emblazoned with the FBI logo.” Apparently, the plan was aborted after several FBI supervisors refused to cooperate, viewing it as inappropriate. One agent was disciplined for insubordination after refusing to go along with the plan to embarrass Comey in this way. Not all criminal defendants suffer the same The extent to which criminal defendants experience the criminal justice process as a form of punishment varies from person to person. For high-status people like Comey , lost wages and attorneys’ and court fees may not be that big of a deal. But these costs may be incredibly significant for other people who have been, or are likely to be, targeted by the Trump administration. The high costs of lawyers’ fees are well known to the president. For instance, his political action committee spent millions of dollars on attorneys’ fees in an unsuccessful effort to defend Trump from criminal charges in New York. In addition, people no doubt experience the psychological stress and stigma of a possible criminal conviction differently. But regardless of one’s wealth, the lost time spent preparing a criminal defense is something that cannot be replaced. The recognition that the criminal process is itself a form of punishment is one of the reasons that the Department of Justice has maintained independence from the president. By violating the tradition of staying out of politics, the Justice Department in the Trump administration has opened the door for the president to seek retribution on his perceived political enemies. The mere act of putting them through the criminal process ensures that they suffer, regardless of their guilt or innocence.",https://theconversation.com/for-trumps-perceived-enemies-the-process-may-be-the-punishment-266747,Society,BBC,Paul M.

41d490284e6e,James Comey’s indictment is a trademark tactic of authoritarians,"alexei navalny, authoritarianism, democracy, department of justice, donald trump, ethics, fbi, fbi director, fifth amendment, james comey, nicolás maduro, recep tayyip erdogan, us constitution, us law, viktor orbán, vladimir putin, watergate, white house, authoritarians","Former FBI Director James Comey was indicted by a federal grand jury on Sept. 25, 2025 – only the second time in history an FBI director has faced criminal charges. The indictment came just five days after President Donald Trump took to social media to demand that Comey be prosecuted, and three days after Trump installed a former aide as the prosecutor to bring the case. Legal experts across the political spectrum describe this as an unprecedented political prosecution that breaks fundamental democratic norms and mirrors tactics used by authoritarian leaders worldwide. As a professor of law , I think Comey’s indictment is momentous because it tests a principle that has protected American democracy for 50 years: Presidents should not direct prosecutors to charge their political enemies. When leaders can abuse the justice system to target critics and investigators, the rule of law collapses. An unconstitutional indictment The evidence of political interference in Comey’s indictment is unusually strong. Trump waged an eight-year vendetta against Comey after the FBI investigated Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election . On Sept. 20, Trump posted on Truth Social demanding prosecution: “What about Comey, Adam ‘Shifty’ Schiff, Leticia??? They’re all guilty as hell… We can’t delay any longer… JUSTICE MUST BE SERVED, NOW!!!” After the indictment, Trump called Comey “one of the worst human beings this country has ever been exposed to.” The Fifth Amendment protects against vindictive and selective prosecution. To prove vindictive prosecution, a defendant must show through objective evidence that the prosecutor acted with “genuine animus” and that the defendant would not have been prosecuted except for that hostility. Comey listens to the committee chairman at the beginning of the Senate Intelligence Committee hearing on Capitol Hill on June 8, 2017, in Washington. AP Photo/Alex Brandon As the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit explained in United States v. Wilson in 2001, the government cannot prosecute someone to punish them “for doing what the law plainly allows him to do.” When circumstances create a realistic likelihood of vindictiveness, the burden shifts to the government to justify its conduct. After Comey’s indictment, Jordan Rubin , a former prosecutor in the Manhattan D.A.’s office, stated: “If the Trump administration’s prosecution of James Comey isn’t ‘selective’ and ‘vindictive,’ then those words have lost all meaning.” Additionally, three former White House ethics counsels – Norman Eisen, Richard Painter and Virginia Canter – wrote to Congress after Comey’s indictment, saying that in the U.S. “a president should never order prosecutions of his enemies. That happens in Putin’s Russia, and it has happened in other dictatorships, but not here. Until now.” They concluded: “If the Trump administration can do this, then no American is safe from political prosecution.” Broken judicial norms For 50 years since the Watergate scandal that exposed President Richard Nixon’s abuses of power, American presidents have followed a core principle: They must not interfere in decisions about who gets investigated or charged, especially not for political reasons. The Justice Department’s manual includes the post-Watergate requirement that legal judgments must be “ impartial and insulated from political influence .” The three former ethics counsels emphasized that during their service, they “never once saw” Presidents George W. Bush, Barack Obama or Bill Clinton “suggest that the Department of Justice should prosecute a specific person, much less a political adversary.” Comey was indicted on two counts – one count of making a false statement to Congress and one count of obstruction of a congressional proceeding, both in connection with his testimony before a Senate committee in September 2020. The allegations against Comey were reviewed multiple times. Special counsel John Durham examined them during Trump’s first term . Prosecutors with the U.S. attorney’s office in Washington, D.C., during the Biden administration called Comey to testify before a grand jury about allegedly using his friend Daniel Richman as a conduit to leak information to the press. And career prosecutors in 2025 under former U.S. Attorney Erik Siebert also reviewed the allegations. Everyone declined to charge Comey . The procedural breakdown reveals how fundamentally this case violates norms. Career prosecutors wrote a memo in September 2025 stating they could not establish probable cause to charge Comey. When Siebert refused to proceed, Trump removed him and installed Lindsey Halligan, Trump’s former personal defense attorney . She has no prosecutorial experience. Three days later, Halligan brought the indictment. She signed it alone – no career prosecutors put their names on it, as is usually done. The grand jury rejected one of the three charges prosecutors tried to bring, a rare signal of weak evidence. Comey’s son-in-law, Troy A. Edwards Jr., a federal prosecutor in the same office where Halligan now works, resigned immediately, stating he was leaving “ to uphold my oath to the Constitution .” Comey was arraigned on Oct. 8 and pleaded not guilty. Echoes of authoritarians Prosecuting former law enforcement officials who investigated the country’s leader is not typical of democracies. It is a hallmark tactic of authoritarian rulers seeking to consolidate power. In Turkey, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan arrested his main political rival in March 2025 on corruption charges that critics call politically motivated. Between 2014 and 2020, Erdogan investigated 160,000 Turks for insulting the president and prosecuted 45,000 of them, including a 14-year-old boy . More than 1,400 people were arrested and detained in nationwide protests. Russia under Vladimir Putin provides the starkest example. Opposition leader Alexei Navalny was poisoned by security services, imprisoned on politically motivated charges and ultimately died in prison in 2024. Even the lawyers who defended Navalny faced criminal prosecution. Russian President Vladimir Putin, right, and Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban attend a joint news conference outside Moscow on Feb. 17, 2016. Maxim Shipenkov/Pool Photo via AP In Venezuela, President Nicolás Maduro has systematically arrested opposition leaders and forced critics into exile . Maduro inherited a stacked Supreme Court from his predecessor, Hugo Chávez, that has systematically nullified opposition legislation . The court has also orchestrated takeovers of opposition parties and certified Maduro’s fraudulent 2024 election claim despite opposition evidence showing it won by a 2-to-1 margin. And Hungary’s Viktor Orban created the Sovereignty Protection Office with powers to investigate any organization or person it suspects of receiving foreign support to influence public life or the democratic process. Orban also installed a loyalist chief prosecutor under whose office “numerous high-profile allegations of corruption have been either quietly shelved or investigated perfunctorily before being dropped,” according to EU Today. The pattern is clear: When leaders can use the justice system to protect themselves, whether by prosecuting investigators, refusing to investigate corruption or intimidating the judiciary, democratic institutions erode and the rule of law becomes a tool of political control rather than a constraint on power. What this means for America Legal experts predict Comey will be acquitted – the evidence is weak and the political interference is blatant. But as a scholar of legal ethics, I believe the damage is already done. Trump has shown he can force prosecutors to charge his enemies. Future government officials now face an impossible choice: investigate powerful people, as Comey did, and risk prosecution, or decline to investigate and allow corruption to flourish. Yet there may be a silver lining: When governments break norms this brazenly, they often create legal vulnerabilities. Legal commentator Ed Whelan has pointed out that Halligan’s appointment may violate a 1986 Office of Legal Counsel memo authored by then-Deputy Assistant Attorney General Samuel Alito, which concluded that only one interim U.S. attorney appointment is permitted under the statute. Former interim U.S. Attorney Erik Siebert had already served that term. If Halligan wasn’t validly appointed , the indictment may be legally void. The precedent this case sets affects every American. As the former ethics counsels wrote after Comey’s indictment: “No American should have to go through the experience of being prosecuted under these circumstances, and the rest of us should not have to live in fear that it may also happen to us.”",https://theconversation.com/james-comeys-indictment-is-a-trademark-tactic-of-authoritarians-266214,Society,BBC,Cassandra Burke Robertson,https://images.theconversation.com/files/695154/original/file-20251008-64-wttx2t.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&rect=0%2C250%2C4444%2C2222&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop,2025-10-08T16:29:10+00:00,4a0d81ea3b75d83ca947e2fb094dbf3e8736184d
93afc48767dc,Why higher ed’s AI rush could put corporate interests over public service and independence,"ai and education (spencer), artificial intelligence ethics, artificial intelligence (ai), higher education, public-private partnership","Artificial intelligence technology has begun to transform higher education , raising a new set of profound questions about the role of universities in society. A string of high-profile corporate partnerships reflect how universities are embracing AI technology. The University of Florida began assembling one of the fastest university supercomputers through a collaboration with Nvidia encompassing AI infrastructure, research support and curriculum development . Princeton launched the New Jersey AI Hub with Microsoft, CoreWeave and the state government, which will house AI startups on university-owned land under a Princeton director . Meanwhile, the California State University system partnered with OpenAI to provide ChatGPT Edu to all students and faculty, branding itself as “ the first AI-powered university system in the United States .” As a social scientist who studies educational technology and organizational partnerships, I view these collaborations as part of a decades-long shift toward the “ corporatization” of higher education – where universities have become increasingly market-driven, aligning their priorities, culture and governance structures with industry partners. I see the rise of generative AI as accelerating this trend, which risks undermining higher education’s autonomy and public service mission. Examining the underlying organizational forces that shape the future of higher education can shed light on how AI challenges universities’ traditional principles – and how they might resist corporate influence. The rise of corporate partnerships Over the past 50 years, private sector support for university research has increased tenfold , outpacing overall growth in higher education research spending. A pivotal shift came in 1980, when universities gained the right to retain intellectual property from federally funded research. This made commercialization of university research far easier . Over time, corporate involvement pushed university research toward commercial needs and increasingly exposed universities to the profit motive. But partnerships haven’t just brought in money for universities; they’ve reinforced a shift toward closer alignment with industry . Universities expanded dramatically in the second half of the 20th century to meet companies’ demand for skilled labor , further coupling higher education to market incentives. After decades of growth, however, university enrollment peaked in 2010 , partly due to demographics, and the decline is projected to continue . Meanwhile, competition from training programs offered by tech companies has been growing , and federal funding has been slashed under President Donald Trump . As colleges continue to close at record rates , the imperative to attract tuition dollars and research grants increasingly dictates institutional priorities . I argue that universities risk sidelining research that serves the public interest by looking toward corporate funding and partnerships to fill the gaps. In my view, the shift away from public-good scholarship to monetizable content and services shaped by external industry partners jeopardizes the academic freedom and intellectual stewardship that once anchored the mission of higher education. For example, under financial constraints, university administrators may be inclined to overlook glaring value misalignments between their public mission and the commercial objectives of AI firms. The forces driving universities’ AI initiatives At many universities, AI adoption and the turn toward corporate collaborations are driven by more than economic vulnerabilities. The broad range of partnerships with AI companies across higher education can provide insight into the deeper dynamics at work. Differences in AI partnerships are emerging around long-standing divides between types of institutions . Stanford’s Institute for Human-Centered AI can be interpreted as an attempt to steer global discourse on ethical AI while preserving human-led research as a marker of elite prestige. Meanwhile, AI initiatives at institutions with a strong focus on teaching and accessibility, such as California State University and Arizona State University , appear to prioritize efficiency in learning outcomes and workforce development. The California State University system aims to become the first and largest ‘AI-powered university system,’ motivated in part to prepare students for careers in an AI-driven economy. Myung J. Chun via Getty Images This underscores how AI partnerships are not guided by market incentives alone. Before universities grew into multibillion-dollar businesses , their decision-making was primarily driven by markers of intellectual prestige, such as scholarly excellence and faculty reputation. Universities largely held a monopoly over knowledge production and served as the primary gatekeepers of intellectual legitimacy, until the digital revolution dramatically decentralized access to knowledge and its production . Universities now coexist in – and increasingly compete with – a crowded, complex ecosystem of companies and organizations that produce original research. Generative AI represents a powerful new mode of knowledge production and synthesis, which further threatens to upend traditional forms of scholarship . Confronted with challenges to their authority, universities may attempt to preserve their elite intellectual status by rushing into partnerships with AI companies eager to capture the higher education market . My interpretation is that economic pressures and the pursuit of prestige may be converging to reinforce a technocratic approach to higher education , where university decision-making is primarily guided by performance metrics and corporate-style governance rather than the public interest. A purposeful path forward The evolution of higher education in response to AI has brought long-standing debates about the purpose of universities to the forefront of public discourse . Decades of corporatization has helped fuel widespread “ mission sprawl ” and conflicting institutional goals across higher education. Consistent with organizational theory , ambiguity about universities’ role in society could lead many institutions to become increasingly susceptible to corporate co-optation, political interference and eventual collapse . Although partnerships between universities and corporations can advance research and support students , corporate norms and academic principles are inherently distinct . And at many universities the process through which differences in institutional values are surfaced and reconciled is unclear, especially as AI initiatives have often sidestepped democratic faculty governance . The recent surge in AI partnerships puts in plain view the growing dominance of market forces in higher education. As universities continue to adopt AI technologies, the consequences for intellectual freedom, democratic decision-making and commitment to the public good will become an increasingly pressing question.

The membership roll already includes scores of famous actors like Jamie Lee Curtis, Viola Davis, Whoopi Goldberg, Pedro Pascal, Natalie Portman and Michael Keaton. Successful directors like Spike Lee and Ben Stiller have signed on, along with singer and actress Barbra Streisand and pop star and songwriter Billie Eilish. Fonda, a star who has championed progressive causes since the 1970s , explained when she announced the group’s new edition on Oct. 1, 2025, that the effort isn’t really new. Instead, it marks the relaunch of the Committee for the First Amendment , an organization her father, actor Henry Fonda , had belonged to. The original Committee for the First Amendment was formed in October 1947 at a time when the U.S. government worried that there were communists in Hollywood who were putting left-wing propaganda into the movies. Jane Fonda, here shown attending the 2024 Hollywood Climate Summit at the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, has been a famous activist almost as long as she’s been a leading lady. Kevin Winter/Getty Images Hearings divided Hollywood The attack on Hollywood started when a bipartisan congressional committee held a series of highly publicized hearings in 1947 on what it said was the “communist infiltration of the motion picture industry.” The House Un-American Activities Committee , known as HUAC, invited 23 “friendly” anti-communist witnesses to testify. Ayn Rand , a Russian-born novelist and screenwriter who hated communism, was one of the witnesses. She testified that the 1944 MGM movie “ Song of Russia ” showed clean, well-dressed, happy peasants, which she said was a sanitized, propagandized version of life in the USSR. Another movie that came under suspicion was “It’s a Wonderful Life.” The FBI complained that the 1946 blockbuster , which starred Jimmy Stewart as a broken man who learns the true value of his life, “deliberately maligned the upper classes” with its negative portrayal of Mr. Potter, the town’s richest man. The HUAC hearings continued for a decade and divided Hollywood. The committee’s interrogators demanded that people turn on each other and “name names.” Due to these hearings, as well as an anti-communist publication called Red Channels , hundreds of screenwriters, directors, producers, actors and musicians were fired or blacklisted for having ties to liberal groups. Nine of 10 Hollywood writers, directors and producers, indicted by a Washington grand jury on charges of contempt of Congress, surrender in a group at the U.S. Marshals Service office in Los Angeles on Dec. 10, 1947. AP Photo/Harold Filan Fighting back The HUAC hearings brought Hollywood stars and the flashbulbs of the nation’s press corps to Capitol Hill. Conservative screen idols like Gary Cooper testified that communism wasn’t “on the level.” Friendly witnesses , like Rand and Cooper, were allowed to read prepared statements and to speak for as long as they liked. Such courtesies were not granted to the 10 “unfriendly” witnesses – the suspected communists who became known as the “ Hollywood 10 .” Screenwriter John Howard Lawson was the first of the Hollywood 10 to testify. Lawson, after refusing to answer if he was a communist or not, was shouted down by Rep. J. Parnell Thomas , a New Jersey Republican who served as HUAC chair. After Lawson was removed from the courtroom, HUAC’s chief investigator, Robert Stripling, read detailed evidence of Lawson’s communist affiliations. Prominent Hollywood liberals understood that these hearings were an attack on free speech, free assembly and other rights guaranteed by the First Amendment . Ira Gershwin , the lyricist known for his hit show tunes such as “I Got Rhythm” and “They Can’t Take That Away From Me,” hosted the first gathering of the Committee for the First Amendment at his Beverly Hills mansion. Attendees included Judy Garland, Humphrey Bogart, Lauren Bacall and Gene Kelly. The committee quickly raised US$13,000 – the equivalent of $188,000 today – and chartered an airplane to Washington. Upon their arrival in the capital, they marched and spoke out in support of the Hollywood 10. Next, they produced a radio broadcast, “ Hollywood Fights Back ,” as a defense of the rights of Americans to write, produce, act in and see whatever movies they pleased. The committee released an initial statement with 35 signatories . A few months later, it published a pamphlet with more than 300 additional names supporting the effort. Purging Hollywood If you’ve never heard of that committee, or if you only learned about it recently when the new version made headlines, you’re not alone. The group fizzled out almost as quickly as it had mobilized. Bogart, perhaps its most famous member, soon retracted his support for the Hollywood 10, saying in March 1948 that he regretted his trip to Washington. “ I’m no Communist ,” the “ Casablanca ” star declared in a widely circulated statement. Two crucial developments kneecapped the committee. First, the HUAC cited the Hollywood 10 for contempt of Congress . They were later tried in court and convicted of that crime. They eventually served prison time. Also, studio executives drafted new hiring policies for the movie industry. Later known as the “ Waldorf declaration ” because the meeting took place in the Waldorf-Astoria hotel in Manhattan, the studio heads announced that the Hollywood 10 would be fired and banned from any studio, and that all the studios would agree to fire and ban any known communists. Over the next decade, hundreds more stars and other key players in the entertainment industry were fired, purged and blacklisted in what became known as the blacklist era. I’m a professor of English and film studies , and I’m writing a book about progressive films made during those years . The original committee’s members were mainly leftists and liberals whose careers survived the political pressures to root them out of show business. The Committee for the First Amendment ultimately failed to protect the Hollywood 10 from professional attacks or incarceration, nor did it prevent hundreds of others from being blacklisted. Bad timing But I don’t believe that the original Committee for the First Amendment was destined to fail. The Hollywood 10’s legal strategy, rooted in the First Amendment, reflected the hope that their convictions might be eventually overturned by the Supreme Court. Unluckily, however, Frank Murphy and Wiley Blount Rutledge , two of the court’s most liberal justices, died before the appeal of the first two Hollywood 10 convictions could reach them. After President Harry Truman replaced them, the Supreme Court declined to hear the appeals. Most of the Hollywood 10 served prison sentences between 1950 and 1951. Why bother? Given that the Committee for the First Amendment failed to protect Hollywood from conservative repression in the 1940s and 1950s, why would anyone revive it? One reason is that there are parallels between the blacklist era and today. For example, the Trump administration is trying to get comedians who poke fun at him kicked off the air, as evidenced by talk show host Jimmy Kimmel being temporarily pulled off the air. Hollywood has also seen a surge in labor organizing. Many members of the new Committee for the First Amendment were on the front lines of the screenwriters and actors strikes of 2023 . Finally, this fight is arguably worth waging. Most Americans see the First Amendment as enshrining valuable rights. An October 2025 Marist poll found that 4 in 5 Americans think the U.S. is restricting First Amendment freedoms too much. Americans still debate whether or not it was right to fire and blacklist Hollywood’s suspected communists. While many see the HUAC hearings as a travesty , others defend the House committee and the anti-communist fervor that inspired it. ‘The Pajama Game,’ a hit movie made in the 1950s, featured a fight by workers for higher pay. Resilience and silence Many look at the blacklist era as a time of capitulation by progressives in the face of repression. While there’s some validity to these claims, I’ve found that many progressive filmmakers also banded together, using allegory and other creative techniques to make movies with progressive – sometimes radical – messages. Take “The Pajama Game,” for example. It’s a musical comedy about labor trouble in a pajama factory. While the film is a sexy, frothy romp, on the one hand, the film also casts Doris Day as Babe, a feisty union steward. In “Racing with the Clock,” workers sing about the pressure they feel to speed up the pace of their labor. Scenes include workers organizing a slowdown, sabotaging machinery and going on strike. The last word spoken in the film is “solidarity.” To me, the revival of the Committee for the First Amendment draws attention to the dangers implicit in efforts to muzzle writers, artists and filmmakers. “Silence the artist, and you silence the most articulate voice the people have,” the actress Katharine Hepburn said in May 1947 in a speech written for her by Dalton Trumbo , one of the Hollywood 10. “Destroy culture and you destroy one of the strongest sources of inspiration from which a people can draw strength to fight for a better life.”",https://theconversation.com/jane-fonda-other-stars-revive-the-committee-for-the-first-amendment-a-group-that-emerged-when-the-anti-communist-panic-came-for-hollywood-266751,Society,BBC,Kathy M.

But my research shows it often comes with a catch : Homebuyers who win bidding wars tend to experience a “winner’s curse,” systematically overpaying for their new homes. I’m a real estate economist , and my colleagues and I analyzed nearly 14 million home sales in 30 U.S. states over roughly two decades. We found that people who paid more than the asking price for their homes – a reliable sign of a bidding war – were more likely to default on their mortgages and saw significantly weaker returns. How much weaker? On average, homebuyers who won bidding wars saw annual returns that were about 1.3 percentage points lower than those who didn’t, we found. We specifically looked at “unlevered” returns – basically, the returns you’d get if you bought the home outright with cash, without factoring in a mortgage. Since the typical homeowner in our sample held a property for 6.3 years before selling it, this translates to about an 8.2% overpayment. Bidding-war winners were also 1.9 percentage points likelier to default. Perhaps that loss would be worth it to someone who absolutely loves the property – but we found that homebuyers who purchase after a bidding war are also faster to resell. This suggests their overpayment is based less on enduring affection and more on bidding-war fever. We also found that the effects of the winner’s curse – lower home appreciation and higher default rates – are stronger in places where bidding wars are more common. One example is my hometown of Rochester, New York, which has become a bidding-war hot spot in recent years. Who bears the brunt? Lower-income, Black and Hispanic buyers are more likely to overpay in bidding wars, we found, making them more likely to suffer from the winner’s curse. This suggests that hot housing markets can worsen inequality. Why it matters While housing is the largest single form of wealth Americans own, past research on the winner’s curse mostly dealt with land auctions and company mergers – not the nation’s roughly 76 million owner-occupied, single-family homes . Our work is the first to show the direct evidence of the winner’s curse in residential housing markets. This matters now because the housing market is cooling. Those who bought in the post-pandemic housing market and listed their homes in 2025 are already facing the risk of selling at a loss . Because this risk falls disproportionately on Black and Hispanic homebuyers, it could further widen the wealth gap. By one measure, foreclosures are up 18% year over year . If the brunt of these losses falls on lower-income or otherwise vulnerable homeowners, the result could be an increase in housing insecurity and homelessness. The good news is that the winner’s curse may be preventable. Better resources to prepare first-time homebuyers and comprehensive financial education related to mortgages and debt could help. What still isn’t known It’s possible more transparent bidding processes – or even formal auction systems for popular homes – could better inform prospective buyers and help them stave off the temptation of overpayment. Should the U.S. require real estate brokers or banks to caution their clients to think twice before going above the asking price? Or would that be unfair to sellers? Experimental research on these points would be useful. Finally, our research focuses on the U.S. housing market. Whether the winner’s curse afflicts buyers in other countries remains an open question.

a820e802f483,Geothermal energy has huge potential to generate clean power – including from used oil and gas wells,"earth, energy, fracking, geothermal, geothermal energy, ground source heat pump, heat pumps, hydraulic fracturing, international energy agency, oil and gas, power generation, solar pv, wells, wind power, clean power, gas wells, oil wells","As energy use rises and the planet warms, you might have dreamed of an energy source that works 24/7, rain or shine, quietly powering homes, industries and even entire cities without the ups and downs of solar or wind – and with little contribution to climate change . The promise of new engineering techniques for geothermal energy – heat from the Earth itself – has attracted rising levels of investment to this reliable, low-emission power source that can provide continuous electricity almost anywhere on the planet. That includes ways to harness geothermal energy from idle or abandoned oil and gas wells. In the first quarter of 2025, North American geothermal installations attracted US$1.7 billion in public funding – compared with $2 billion for all of 2024 , which itself was a significant increase from previous years, according to an industry analysis from consulting firm Wood Mackenzie. As an exploration geophysicist and energy engineer , I’ve studied geothermal systems’ resource potential and operational trade-offs firsthand. From the investment and technological advances I’m seeing, I believe geothermal energy is poised to become a significant contributor to the energy mix in the U.S. and around the world, especially when integrated with other renewable sources. A May 2025 assessment by the U.S. Geological Survey found that geothermal sources just in the Great Basin, a region that encompasses Nevada and parts of neighboring states, have the potential to meet as much as 10% of the electricity demand of the whole nation – and even more as technology to harness geothermal energy advances. And the International Energy Agency estimates that by 2050, geothermal energy could provide as much as 15% of the world’s electricity needs . For generations, Maori people in New Zealand, and other people elsewhere around the world, have made use of the Earth’s heat, as in hot springs, where these people are cooking food in the hot water. Wolfgang Kaehler/LightRocket via Getty Images Why geothermal energy is unique Geothermal energy taps into heat beneath the Earth’s surface to generate electricity or provide direct heating. Unlike solar or wind, it never stops. It runs around the clock, providing consistent, reliable power with closed-loop water systems and few emissions. Geothermal is capable of providing significant quantities of energy. For instance, Fervo Energy’s Cape Station project in Utah is reportedly on track to deliver 100 megawatts of baseload, carbon-free geothermal power by 2026. That’s less than the amount of power generated by the average coal plant in the U.S., but more than the average natural gas plant produces. But the project, estimated to cost $1.1 billion , is not complete. When complete in 2028 , the station is projected to deliver 500 megawatts of electricity . That amount is 100 megawatts more than its original goal without additional drilling, thanks to various technical improvements since the project broke ground. And geothermal energy is becoming economically competitive . By 2035, according to the International Energy Agency, technical advances could mean energy from enhanced geothermal systems could cost as little as $50 per megawatt-hour , a price competitive with other renewable sources . Types of geothermal energy There are several ways to get energy from deep within the Earth. Hydrothermal systems tap into underground hot water and steam to generate electricity. These resources are concentrated in geologically active areas where heat, water and permeable rock naturally coincide. In the U.S., that’s generally California, Nevada and Utah. Internationally, most hydrothermal energy is in Iceland and the Philippines. Some hydrothermal facilities, such as Larderello in Italy , have operated for over a century , proving the technology’s long-term viability. Others in New Zealand and the U.S. have been running since the late 1950s and early 1960s. A drilling rig sits outside a home in White Plains, N.Y., where a geothermal heat pump is being installed. AP Photo/Julia Nikhinson Enhanced geothermal systems effectively create electricity-generating hydrothermal processes just about anywhere on the planet. In places where there is not enough water in the ground or where the rock is too dense to move heat naturally, these installations drill deep holes and inject fluid into the hot rocks, creating new fractures and opening existing ones, much like hydraulic fracturing for oil and gas production. A system like this uses more than one well. In one, it pumps cold water down, which collects heat from the rocks and then is pumped back up through another well, where the heat drives turbines. In recent years, academic and corporate research has dramatically improved drilling speed and lowered costs . Ground source heat pumps do not require drilling holes as deep, but instead take advantage of the fact that the Earth’s temperature is relatively stable just below the surface, even just 6 or 8 feet down (1.8 to 2.4 meters) – and it’s hotter hundreds of feet lower . These systems don’t generate electricity but rather circulate fluid in underground pipes, exchanging heat with the soil, extracting warmth from the ground in winter and transferring warmth to the ground in summer. These systems are similar but more efficient than air-source heat pumps, sometimes called minisplits , which are becoming widespread across the U.S. for heating and cooling. Geothermal heat pump systems can serve individual homes, commercial buildings and even neighborhood or business developments . Direct-use applications also don’t generate electricity but rather use the geothermal heat directly. Farmers heat greenhouses and dry crops ; aquaculture facilities maintain optimal water temperatures; industrial operations use the heat to dehydrate food, cure concrete or other energy-intensive processes. Worldwide, these applications now deliver over 100,000 megawatts of thermal capacity . Some geothermal fluids contain valuable minerals; lithium concentrations in the groundwater of California’s Salton Sea region could potentially supply battery manufacturers . Federal judges are reviewing a proposal to do just that, as well as legal challenges to it . Researchers are finding new ways to use geothermal resources, too. Some are using underground rock formations to store energy as heat when consumer demand is low and use it to produce electricity when demand rises. Some geothermal power stations can adjust their output to meet demand , rather than running continuously at maximum capacity. Geothermal sources are also making other renewable-energy projects more effective. Pairing geothermal energy with solar and wind resources and battery storage are increasing the reliability of above-ground renewable power in Texas , among other places. And geothermal energy can power clean hydrogen production as well as energy-intensive efforts to physically remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere , as is happening in Iceland . Enhanced geothermal systems can be built almost anywhere and can take advantage of existing wells to save the time and money of drilling new holes deep into the ground. U.S. Geological Survey Geothermal potential in the US and worldwide Currently, the U.S. has about 3.9 gigawatts of installed geothermal capacity , mostly in the West. That’s about 0.4% of current U.S. energy production , but the amount of available energy is much larger , according to federal and international engineering assessments. And converting abandoned oil and gas wells for enhanced geothermal systems could significantly increase the amount of energy available and its geographic spread. One example is happening in Beaver County, in the southwestern part of Utah. Once a struggling rural community , it now hosts multiple geothermal plants that are being developed to both demonstrate the potential and to supply electricity to customers as far away as California . Those projects include repurposing idle oil or gas wells , which is relatively straightforward: Engineers identify wells that reach deep, hot rock formations and circulate water or another fluid in a closed loop to capture heat to generate electricity or provide direct heating. This method does not require drilling new wells, which significantly reduces setup costs and environmental disruption and accelerates deployment . There are as many as 4 million abandoned oil and gas wells across the U.S., some of which could shift from being fossil fuel infrastructure into opportunities for clean energy . Challenges and trade-offs Geothermal energy is not without technical, environmental and economic hurdles. Drilling is expensive , and conventional systems need specific geological conditions . Enhanced systems, using hydraulic fracturing, risk causing earthquakes . Overall emissions are low from geothermal systems, though the systems can release hydrogen sulfide, a corrosive gas that is toxic to humans and can contribute to respiratory irritation . But modern geothermal plants use abatement systems that can capture up to 99.9% of hydrogen sulfide before it enters the atmosphere. And the systems do use water, though closed-loop systems can minimize consumption. Building geothermal power stations does require significant investment , but its ability to deliver energy over the long term can offset many of these costs . Projects like those undertaken by Fervo Energy show that government subsidies are no longer necessary for a project to get funded, built and begin generating energy. Despite its challenges, geothermal energy’s reliability, low emissions and scalability make it a vital complement to solar and wind – and a cornerstone of a stable, low-carbon energy future.",https://theconversation.com/geothermal-energy-has-huge-potential-to-generate-clean-power-including-from-used-oil-and-gas-wells-266555,Society,BBC,Moones Alamooti,https://images.theconversation.com/files/694654/original/file-20251006-56-n1yweb.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&rect=0%2C486%2C4804%2C2402&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop,2025-10-08T12:24:23+00:00,2a683e6fb965629b76205fa6109336edc99f6e51
55377bbf68d1,Seasonal allergies may increase suicide risk – new research,"allergies, new research, pollen, quick reads, research brief, seasonal allergies, suicide, suicide rates","Seasonal allergies – triggered by pollen – appear to make deaths by suicide more likely. Our findings, published in the Journal of Health Economics , show that minor physical health conditions like mild seasonal allergies, previously thought not to be an immediate trigger of suicide, are indeed a risk factor. To evaluate the link between seasonal allergies and suicide, my co-authors and I combined daily pollen measurements with daily suicide counts across 34 U.S. metropolitan areas. Because both pollen and suicide are sensitive to weather conditions , we carefully accounted for temperature, rainfall and wind. We also controlled for differences in local climate and plant life, since pollen levels vary by region, and for seasonal averages that might otherwise obscure results. This allowed us to compare suicide counts on days with unexpectedly high pollen to days with little or none in the same county. The results were striking. Relative to days with no or low levels of pollen, we found that deaths by suicide rose by 5.5% when pollen levels are moderate and 7.4% when levels are high. The increase was even larger among people with a known history of mental health conditions or treatment. We also showed that on high-pollen days, residents of affected areas experience more depressive symptoms and exhaustion. Our analysis suggests that allergies exacerbate existing vulnerabilities, pushing some people toward crisis. We suspect that sleep disruption is the link between allergies and suicide rates. Why it matters More than 80 million Americans experience seasonal allergies each year. Symptoms include sneezing, congestion, itchy eyes and scratchy throat. Most people experiencing these symptoms feel sluggish during the day and sleep poorly at night. Allergy sufferers might not realize, however, that these symptoms reduce alertness and cognitive functioning – some of the factors that can worsen mental health and increase vulnerability to suicidal thoughts and behaviors. Suicide rates have been growing steadily in the past two decades, by 37% between 2000 and 2018 . According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, more than 49,000 Americans died by suicide in 2022 , and over 616,000 visited emergency departments for self-harm injuries. Although socioeconomic and demographic factors are the most important predictors of suicide , much less is known about its short-term triggers. Our study adds to growing evidence that the environment – including something as natural as pollen – can influence mental health risks . This issue is likely to become more urgent as the climate changes. Rising temperatures lengthen pollen seasons and increase pollen volume . Over the past two decades, pollen seasons have grown in both intensity and duration , and projections suggest they will continue to worsen . That means more people will experience stronger allergy symptoms, with ripple effects not only for physical health but also for sleep, mood and mental well-being. Higher temperatures from climate change contribute to more pollen in the air for longer periods of time during pollen seasons. Christoph Burgstedt/iStock via Getty Images Plus What we still don’t know Despite the scale of the problem, there are no national systems in the U.S. to consistently measure and communicate pollen levels. Most communities lack reliable forecasts and alert systems that would allow vulnerable people to take precautions. This gap limits both prevention and research. Our study focused on metropolitan areas where pollen and death counts were available, but we cannot yet generalize to rural areas. That is a concern because rural communities often face greater shortages in mental health care and pharmacy access – and have seen rising suicide rates over the past decade . What’s next For people who are already receiving mental health care, recognizing and treating seasonal allergies is a key part of self-care. Over-the-counter medications can be highly effective at reducing symptoms . More broadly, people should be aware that during peak allergy season, reduced alertness, sleep disruptions and mood fluctuations may place an increased burden on their mental health, in addition to the allergy symptoms. In terms of policy, improving pollen monitoring and public communication could help people anticipate high-risk days. Such infrastructure would also support further research, particularly in rural areas where data is currently lacking. Our next step, supported by the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention , is to examine the impact of pollen on rural communities.

As if cybersecurity wasn’t challenging enough, fewer CISA employees are being asked to do more and more work protecting American cyberspace during the shutdown. And they’ll be working with the promise of getting paid for their efforts at some date in the future once the shutdown ends. The current CISA situation is grim, from my vantage point as a cybersecurity researcher and former industry practitioner. The agency was already experiencing deep cuts to its staff and resources before the shutdown. And now, coinciding with the shutdown, a key law that enabled the agency to facilitate information-sharing with the private sector has expired . Taken together, the cyberdefense agency is being hobbled at a time when the need for its services has never been greater , from the ongoing China-led Salt Typhoon attack on U.S. telecommunications networks to ransomware, data breaches and threats to infrastructure. CISA was created in 2007 within the Department of Homeland Security. As its name implies, the agency is charged with digital security matters across the federal government. The agency also works with the companies that operate and secure the numerous critical infrastructure sectors of the American economy, such as phone networks, the electric grid and energy pipelines. Additionally, it helps state and local governments across the country secure their vulnerable networks and data. CISA also publishes threat and vulnerability alerts for the government and cybersecurity community and engages with public and private stakeholders on best practices in response to emerging vulnerabilities. Prior to the recent expiration of the 2015 Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act , the agency also made it easier for organizations to share useful information with the government to help cybersecurity teams better protect their systems. Shutdown-mandated furloughs at the nation’s cybersecurity agency present an opportunity for malicious hackers. Political football The agency takes a nonpartisan approach to cybersecurity matters. However, some politicians have accused the agency of political bias for its work helping states protect their voting infrastructure from cyberattacks and external influence. Specifically, the agency was repeatedly maligned for calling the 2020 election the “most secure” in history. For some in elected office, this work on election security has tarnished CISA’s reputation and perhaps explains recent budgetary actions taken against the agency. Since the Trump administration took office in January 2025, nearly 1,000 CISA employees have departed the agency through voluntary buyouts or deferred resignations. By the end of May 2025, nearly all of CISA’s senior leadership had resigned or had announced plans to do so. For 2026, the president’s draft budget proposes to reduce CISA’s head count by nearly one-third, dramatically cutting staff from its risk management and stakeholder engagement divisions. Other cuts will significantly reduce the agency’s collaboration activities and funding for CISA’s various cybersecurity education and training programs. Making the problem worse, the government shutdown began at the same time that Congress failed to renew the Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act . This law provided a legal shield that allowed companies and infrastructure operators to share timely and often sensitive information with CISA about the cyberattacks, vulnerabilities and incidents that they were encountering. In the wake of the law’s expiration, prudent companies may consider restricting what information they share with the government. Without the indemnification provided by CISA, many companies will likely have their legal teams review any information to be shared with the government. And that takes time. Unfortunately, adversaries do not reduce their attacks against the U.S. based on available federal cyber defense funding or the status of cybersecurity laws. In fact, malicious hackers often strike when their target’s guard is down. Charting a better course Early in my career I had to work through a prolonged government shutdown. I’ve also participated in and developed assorted public-private information-sharing environments to exchange intelligence and analysis on cyber- and national security matters. And having been in the D.C. area for over 30 years, I’ve seen how government works. So I have a good idea of what’s needed to improve American cybersecurity. The following suggestions are a starting point. First, Congress could ensure that critical security agencies such as CISA are immune from the threat of recurring federal government shutdowns. If it desired, Congress could set budgets for America’s security agencies on a biennial basis – as 16 states already do for their entire budgets. In terms of cybersecurity funding, the White House’s proposed 2026 budget reduces research and education on cybersecurity. For example, the nation’s premiere federal cybersecurity scholarship program to recruit, educate and place future federal cybersecurity workers would be reduced by over 60% . Protecting this funding would allow CISA and the federal government to maintain the pipeline for a robust and capable cybersecurity workforce both today and into the future. Companies could develop new or expand existing nongovernmental information-sharing networks that are not completely dependent on the government to facilitate or fund, such as the Cyber Threat Alliance or the Center for Internet Security . Cybersecurity relies on trust. But right now, the instability of the federal government makes it difficult to rely on any entity under its policy or funding influence, no matter how well time-tested and trusted . Regardless, without legal protections, the information-sharing utility of these services will be limited. Cybersecurity risks remain even if the federal government shuts down. So this is another reminder that each of us is responsible for our own cybersecurity. Individual users should continue to remain vigilant, follow accepted best practices for cybersecurity and always be mindful about online risks. It’s ironic that the federal government is shutting down, CISA is being eviscerated and the Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act has expired just as the country begins to observe national Cybersecurity Awareness Month – another collaborative public engagement activity that CISA promotes to help improve cybersecurity for all Americans.",https://theconversation.com/federal-shutdown-deals-blow-to-already-hobbled-cybersecurity-agency-266862,Society,BBC,Richard Forno,https://images.theconversation.com/files/694850/original/file-20251007-66-uinnzq.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&rect=3%2C0%2C3031%2C1515&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop,2025-10-07T18:14:01+00:00,f318475fc688d6a90b5ded3c9126661a692e6c66
a7942a91993b,"1 gene, 1 disease no more – acknowledging the full complexity of genetics could improve and personalize medicine","genetic mutation, genetic variation, genetics, genome, genomics, neurodevelopmental disorders, new research, steehm new research","Genetic inheritance may sound straightforward: One gene causes one trait or a specific illness. When doctors use genetics, it’s usually to try to identify a disease-causing gene to help guide diagnosis and treatment. But for most health conditions, the genetics is far more complicated than how clinicians are currently looking at it in diagnosis, counseling and treatment. Your DNA carries millions of genetic variants you inherit from your parents or develop by chance. Some are common variants, shared by many people. Others are rare variants, found in very few people or even unique to a family. Together, these variants shape who you are – from visible traits such as height or eye color to health conditions such as diabetes or heart disease. In our newly published research in the journal Cell, my team and I found that a genetic mutation involved in neurodevelopmental and psychiatric conditions such as autism and schizophrenia is affected by multiple other genetic variants , changing how these conditions develop. Our findings support the idea that, rather than focusing on single genes, taking the whole genome into account would provide insight into how researchers understand what makes someone genetically predisposed to certain diseases and how those diseases develop. Primary and secondary variants Certain rare variants can cause problems on their own , such as the genetic mutations that cause sickle cell anemia and cystic fibrosis. But in many cases, whether someone actually develops symptoms of disease depends on what else is happening across the genome. While a primary variant might trigger a disease, secondary variants can alter how that disease develops and progresses. Think of it like a song: The melody (primary variant) is the main part of the song, but the bassist and drummer (secondary variants) can change its groove and rhythm. That’s why two people with the same genetic mutation can seem so different. One person might have severe symptoms, another person mild symptoms, and another none at all. These variations can even occur within the same family. This phenomenon, called variable expressivity , arises from differences in the secondary variants a person has. In most cases, these variants amplify the effects of the primary mutation. A higher number of secondary variants on top of a primary variant generally leads to more severe disease. Mutations are a source of genetic variation. Sometimes, a primary variant and a secondary variant together can cause two different disorders in the same person, such as Prader-Willi syndrome and Pitt-Hopkins syndrome . Other times, secondary variants have no obvious effect on their own but together can tip the balance of whether and how a disease will appear, even in the absence of a primary variant. This can be seen in the development of heart disease in children . Insights from a missing piece of a chromosome My team and I studied a genetic change known as a 16p12.1 deletion , where a small piece of chromosome 16 is missing. Researchers have linked this mutation to developmental delay, intellectual disability and psychiatric conditions such as schizophrenia. Yet most children inherit this genetic variant from a parent who has milder symptoms, different symptoms or sometimes no symptoms at all. To understand why this happens, we analyzed 442 individuals from 124 families carrying this genetic mutation. We found that children lacking this piece of chromosome 16 had more secondary variants elsewhere in the genome compared to their carrier parents. These secondary variants took many forms, including both small changes and large deletions, duplications and expansions of their DNA. Two types of chromosomal mutations include deletion and duplication. Gandawijaya et al./Biorender via Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience , CC BY-SA Each type of secondary variant was associated with different health outcomes . Some were linked to smaller head size and reduced cognitive function, while others contributed to higher rates of psychiatric or developmental symptoms. This suggests that while a 16p12.1 deletion makes the genome more sensitive to neurodevelopmental disorders, which symptoms manifest depends on which other variants are present. The story gets even more complex when considering the fact that children not only inherit a 16p12.1 deletion from one parent but also inherit secondary variants from both parents. My team and I found that the symptoms of the parent with this genetic mutation often match those of their spouse . For example, a parent with a 16p12.1 deletion who shows signs of anxiety or depression is more likely to have a partner who also has these symptoms. This pattern, called assortative mating , means that when parents with overlapping genetic risks have children, those risks can combine and accumulate. Over generations, this stacking of secondary variants can lead to children who have more severe symptoms than their parents. Biases in genetics research One reason why scientific understanding of secondary variants has lagged is that genetic research often depends on who is recruited to participate in these studies and how researchers recruit them. Most studies recruit patients affected with a particular disease. Families recruited from genetic clinics typically have children with severe versions of the disease. But if studies focus only on patients with the most acute symptoms, researchers may overestimate the effects of primary variants and miss the subtler role that secondary variants may play in how a disease develops. But if researchers were to study people drawn from the general population – say, by recruiting people from a large shopping mall – some might carry the same primary variant but have far milder symptoms or none at all. This variability allows researchers to better dissect how different parts of the genome interact with each other and affect how a disease develops. In our study, for example, we found that people with a 16p12.1 deletion who were recruited from the general population often had milder symptoms and different patterns of secondary variants compared to those who were recruited in a clinic. Who’s included in genetics research influences how scientists understand disease. Cavan Images/iStock via Getty Images Plus Embracing complexity in genetics Instead of a deterministic view where one mutation equals one outcome, a more complex model accounts for the fact that whether and how a disease develops depends on the interplay between different genetic variants and environment. This has implications for how genetics is used in the clinic. Currently, a child who tests positive for a genetic variant might be diagnosed with a disease tied to that mutation. In the future, doctors might also examine the child’s broader genetic profile to better predict their developmental trajectory, psychiatric risk or response to therapies. Families could be counseled with a more realistic picture of their child’s probability of developing a disease, rather than assuming every person with the same genetic variant will share the same outcome. The science is still emerging. Larger and more diverse datasets and models that can better capture the subtle effects of genetic variants and environmental factors are still needed. But what’s clear is that secondary variants are not secondary in importance. By embracing this complexity, I believe genetics can move closer to its ultimate promise: not just explaining why disease happens, but predicting who is most at risk and personalizing care for each individual.",https://theconversation.com/1-gene-1-disease-no-more-acknowledging-the-full-complexity-of-genetics-could-improve-and-personalize-medicine-266558,Society,BBC,Santhosh Girirajan,https://images.theconversation.com/files/694244/original/file-20251003-56-cq04k7.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&rect=0%2C930%2C5000%2C2500&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop,2025-10-07T15:12:14+00:00,8e9dd72b79be8720112cce65d1a3f72461cb4f21

A sixth-generation coal miner, he has led the union for 30 years. Only one man held the role longer: John L. Lewis , whom many consider one of the most important labor leaders of the 20th century. Roberts has seen the union through an especially difficult period for the coal industry and grew up immersed in it. He was raised in Cabin Creek , West Virginia, where his great-grandmother – an activist in her own right – let miners camp on her property during a legendary strike in 1912. Bill Blizzard, his great-uncle, led miners during the Battle of Blair Mountain, the largest labor uprising in U.S. history . Both of his grandfathers died in mine accidents. And there’s another way Roberts is steeped in Appalachian history: Before an audience of workers, observers have often noted, he speaks like a preacher . Roberts likens miners’ struggles to biblical stories, references the power of God and the teachings of Jesus, and speaks in the dynamic cadences found in an Appalachian church . United Mine Workers of America President Cecil Roberts speaks to about 4,000 retired members in Lexington, Ky., on June 14, 2016. AP Photo/Dylan Lovan “Be like Jesus,” he told a rally in Charleston, West Virginia, in 2015, opposing a “right to work” bill that allowed workers in union-run shops to opt out of paying dues. “Jesus saw the money changers in the temple, and Jesus drove the money changers from the temple. So let me tell the National Right to Work Committee, the Chamber of Commerce, the Koch Brothers, and all those who gave money: you got your money’s worth, but we’re not for sale in West Virginia.” “How many of you have been to a Baptist church? We’re going to take up a collection. It is altar call time,” he continued. “Now, I’m going to ask you something: Are you fed up? Let me hear you say, ‘Fed up.’… Are you so fed up that you are now fired up? Let me hear you say, ‘Fired up!’” Capping off the rousing call-and-response, he shouted, “God bless all of you, you’re the salt of the earth!” Roberts’ style is a glimpse into a bigger story. For over a century, coal has transformed central Appalachia : from the shape of the landscape to place names , and from folk music and crafts to economic conditions. All the while, religion has been transforming in the mountains, too. Labor and religion are deeply entangled here – a subject I explored in my book “ Work and Faith in the Kentucky Coal Fields: Subject to Dust .” ‘Railroad religion’ In the 1880s, two groups rushed into the central Appalachian Mountains: industrialists seeking coal , and missionaries seeking moral reform . Both changed the region forever, and their stories were intertwined. At the time, central Appalachia was widely depicted in the popular press as a backward, ignorant region whose mountainous terrain kept its people isolated, outside the flow of progress – a stereotype still common today . Equating economic progress with moral progress, many Americans assumed that developing industry would lift people out of what they perceived as fatalism and superstition. The coal industry used this idea to promote its rapid exploitation of mountain resources. Companies built railroads to connect the region to the national market , developed industrial coal mines and reshaped the central Appalachian economy. Missionaries opened churches , schools and camps. Henry Ford founded Twin Branch, W.Va. – shown here in the 1920s – as a town for coal miners. Bettmann via Getty Images Company-owned coal towns encompassed miners’ lives. People who had long farmed for themselves and lived, as the Bible told them to, “ by the sweat of their brow ,” became dependent upon coal companies as mine development shrank the size of family farms. Not only did employers own the miners’ houses, but they also paid workers in “scrip ,” which was redeemable only at the company store. Many company towns included theaters, offered films and music, and even built churches and paid pastors’ salaries. These were typically mainline Protestant churches, such as Methodist or Presbyterian. To some Appalachian natives, these denominations were known as “railroad religion ” because of the way they entered the mountains. And, for many miners, these were the churches of management. When there was labor unrest, the coal town churches tended to side with the companies, advising miners against strikes or agitation. Faith and action The churches of most miners born in central Appalachia, meanwhile, were in the mountain communities – independent Baptist or Holiness congregations whose pastors were usually miners themselves. Pastors preached about the dangers and sacrifices miners faced deep underground, in an age of few regulations. God was on the side of the oppressed and downtrodden , they stressed – and those who gained at others’ expense would ultimately face divine judgment. A Primitive Baptist church congregation – a denomination also known as Old School Baptists – witnesses a baptism in Triplett Creek, Ky., in 1940. MPI/Getty Images Their passionate preaching was meant to inspire action, whether it was committing one’s life to Jesus or to the union. Labor rights were deeply understood as religious issues, rooted in Christian concerns for justice and care. John Sayles’ 1987 film “Matewan ” powerfully depicted the divided role that religion played in West Virginia’s coalfields. One preacher, played by Sayles, equates the union with “the Prince of Darkness.” Another, a young miner, advocates in biblical terms for the union’s righteousness and helps to lead a strike. The result was the Matewan Massacre of 1920: a bloody battle between miners and armed guards hired by the mine owners. Miner preachers and independent churches were central to the organization of miners in eastern Kentucky in the 1930s, too, during another period of violence between mine operators and miners over conditions, wages and unionization. It was during this time that miner’s wife and singer Sarah Ogan Gunning penned “ Dreadful Memories ,” turning the traditional hymn “Precious Memories” into a visceral depiction of miners’ struggle and a call for unionization: “Dreadful memories, how they linger, How they ever flood my soul. How the workers and their children Died from hunger and from cold.” Miners in Harlan County, Ky., arrive at the Pentecostal Church of God building for a union meeting in 1946. Department of the Interior/National Archives at College Park via Wikimedia Commons Looking to the future Today, it is still not surprising to find religious – particularly Christian – rhetoric in labor organizing. United Auto Workers President Shawn Fain is another example of a union leader whose speeches draw from the Bible. But the dynamics of religion and class forged by industrial mining have shaped central Appalachia’s culture in lasting ways particular to the coalfields. The history of labor struggle, infused with religious idioms, is a source of identity and values evident in everything from union meetings in churches to prayers on picket lines. Today, the United Mine Workers of America is focused less on coal itself, which miners know cannot last forever. The union represents members in other sectors , too, including public employees, manufacturing, health care and employees of the Navajo Nation. It has also focused its work on an equitable transition to renewable energy : one that accounts for the economic, cultural and environmental destruction that a single-industry economy has wreaked on central Appalachia. A memorial in Whitesville, W.Va., honors the 29 miners killed in a 2010 explosion in Massey Energy’s Upper Big Branch coal mine in nearby Montcoal. Kristian Thacker for The Washington Post via Getty Images Likewise, the United Mine Workers of America has fought to hold coal companies to their pension and health care obligations toward retired and sick miners whose work fueled the country and made companies rich.

43310afd8b60,Even small drops in vaccination rates for US children can lead to disease outbreaks,"antivaccine disinformation, antivaccine movement, covid-19, covid-19 vaccines, chickenpox, child vaccinations, measles, mumps, polio vaccine, sciline, vaccination rates, vaccine safety, vaccines, whooping cough","More than three-quarters of U.S. counties and jurisdictions are experiencing declines in childhood vaccination rates, a trend that began in 2019, according to a September 2025 NBC News–Stanford University investigation . The report also found a “large swath” of the U.S. no longer has the “basic, ground-level immunity” needed to stop the spread of measles. Dr. David Higgins , an assistant professor of pediatrics at the University of Colorado CU Anschutz Medical Center and a pediatrician who researches vaccines, discusses the dangers of not vaccinating your children. Dr. David Higgins discusses back-to-school vaccinations. The Conversation has collaborated with SciLine to bring you highlights from the discussion, edited for brevity and clarity. What vaccines are typically required for schoolchildren, and why? David Higgins: The vaccine requirements for kids to attend school are set by states, not the federal government. Most states require kindergartners get vaccines for pertussis – that’s whooping cough – and tetanus , measles , mumps , rubella and chickenpox . For older kids, a booster of the tetanus and pertussis vaccine is typically required, as well as a vaccine for meningococcal disease. Vaccines reduce the risk of outbreaks in places where transmission of these diseases is easy. Not only do vaccinations help keep both students and teachers safe, it also encourages overall higher community coverage for these vaccines. How do scientists track the safety of vaccines over time? Higgins: Before vaccines are approved, they undergo rigorous trials . During this process, scientists look at the safety and effectiveness of the vaccine, testing it first in small groups to assess safety, then in larger groups to confirm protection and detect uncommon side effects. That process continues after the vaccine is approved . Those systems continually monitor the safety of vaccines, both here in the U.S. as well as around the world. What are the vaccination coverage trends for kindergartners? Higgins: What we have seen is a small downward trend since 2019 , the year prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. It slipped from 95% of new kindergartners being up to date on many of their routine vaccines to about 92%. That’s a small percentage decrease, so a great majority of parents are still vaccinating their kids. But at the same time, anything below our target of 95% for diseases like measles becomes a problem, because that’s below the level that’s needed for what we call herd immunity , or community immunity. When that happens, it’s not a matter of if, but when, we see an outbreak of these infectious diseases. And while nationwide rates are important to look at, outbreaks happen at local community levels . For example, earlier this year, an outbreak of measles in West Texas spread rapidly through communities where vaccination rates had slipped well below the state average . So, the vaccination rate at your own school or community is much more meaningful than what the national vaccination rate is. How do non-medical vaccine exemptions work? Higgins: First, actual medical exemptions are rare, and these occur when the vaccine is unsafe for the child to receive , like when he or she has a known severe allergic reaction to vaccine ingredients. Non-medical exemptions for vaccines are often for religious, personal or philosophical reasons . They have been increasing for the past several years, rising from the range of 1 to 2% up to 3.6% in the 2024–25 school year . That’s a small increase, but again, it’s still concerning. Why are some parents vaccine hesitant? Higgins: There are multiple reasons. These include misinformation which algorithm-driven echo chambers on social media can spread at an alarming rate right now . Also, Americans report less trust in institutions and experts , and studies have found growing partisanship around vaccines . Additionally, vaccines are victims of their own success . They have worked so well that many diseases like polio aren’t routinely seen anymore . That might lead a parent to think the risk for their child is so low that the vaccine is not necessary. But the fact is, vaccines are simply holding these diseases at bay. And as vaccination rates drop, these diseases will come back and more kids will be at risk. What advice do you have for parents? Higgins: The most important thing you can do as a parent is to keep your kids up to date on required vaccines. That includes the annual flu shot . Follow your state’s requirements and current recommendations from trusted sources like the American Academy of Pediatrics and your own personal pediatrician to know which vaccines your child should have. You also want to reinforce other common sense approaches to keeping your children healthy. Make sure they know how to wash their hands properly and that they stay home when they’re sick. Teach them to sneeze and cough into their elbow instead of into their hands – even though doing so isn’t a perfect solution . As a pediatrician, I love when my families come and talk to me about their concerns. I help them walk through their worries so they can feel more confident that they’re making a truly informed decision that’s in the best interest of their child’s health.

As a tribal member of Spirit Lake Nation in North Dakota and the former president of Cankdeska Cikana Community College in Fort Totten, North Dakota, I recognize the difference that tribal colleges and universities, like the one I used to work at, can have in rerouting Native students’ education journeys. Tribal colleges and universities , or TCUs, are public institutions that are founded and run by a Native American tribe and focus on serving Native American students and communities. The approximately 3.9 million Native Americans living in the U.S. have long recognized that TCUs are unique institutions that help Native students succeed in school and earn higher education degrees. Most Americans, though, have no idea that tribal colleges and universities even exist, let alone know how they work. Salish Kootenai College in Pablo, Mont., is one of 35 recognized tribal colleges and universities in the country. U.S. Department of Education , CC BY Understanding tribal colleges TCUs enroll approximately 30,000 students each year, including some non-Native students. The median annual tuition at TCUs is US$3,572 , making them more affordable than most other public universities . There are 35 accredited TCUs across 13 states, including Montana, Arizona, Oklahoma, North Dakota and South Dakota. All of these schools are nonprofits. While a single Native tribe sometimes sets up a tribal college, in other cases a consortium of tribes or the federal government helps establish a school. Despite their differences, tribal colleges and universities all have the same mission of teaching Indigenous history, culture and languages. All the tribal colleges also offer associate degrees and certifications. Twenty-two of them have only baccalaureate programs, and nine have master’s programs. Navajo Technical University , a tribal college in Crownpoint, New Mexico, which has the largest enrollment size of all the TCUs, began offering a first of its kind doctorate program in Diné Studies in 2024. This program focuses on the language, culture and history of the Diné people, also known as Navajo people. Affordability has always been a consideration when TCUs set tuition and fees, since most are located on rural American Indian reservations with high unemployment and poverty rates , as well as few available jobs. TCUs keep their tuition relatively low in part because a majority of their funding comes from the federal government . They also receive funding from philanthropic organizations. TCUs also generally have minimal overhead costs, since most students live off-campus and only a handful of these colleges and universities offer on-campus housing. Most TCUs have both in-person and online courses. While there is no single profile of a TCU student, I found that it is common to encounter a 30-year-old, single mother who works full time while trying to earn a college degree. A growth in college enrollment In 1968, just 181 Native Americans graduated from a four-year college. That same year, the Navajo Nation established the first tribal college , then called the Navajo Community College, in Tsaile, Arizona. This school is now called Diné College . Several factors prevented most Native American students from attending a college or university. The cost of college was prohibitive, and many Native American students were also not adequately prepared for college in high school. These students and their families also feared that higher education could force them to assimilate into Western and white culture, and erase their own Native traditions and languages. A long political relationship When considering this historical context, it is important to understand that Native Americans have a unique relationship with the federal government. Native Americans largely consider this relationship a political one, bound by the various legal precedents, federal policies and executive orders from the 1800s and onward. These orders and policies from the past several hundred years vary, but they often focus on questions of land, assimilation and the political independence of Native tribes. There are also treaties and orders that focus on education and spell out the federal government’s responsibility to help coordinate and give money to support tribal education . In 1978, Congress approved the Tribally Controlled Community College Assistance Act , which recognized tribal colleges as higher education institutions and established that the federal government would regularly help fund these schools. Alongside the creation of new tribal colleges and universities over the past several decades, more and more Native people living on reservations have graduated from high school and received higher education degrees. The percentage of Native college graduates rose 125% from 1990 to 2020. While 4.5% of Native students living on reservations received a college degree in 1990, that percentage rose to 10.3% with at least a college degree in 2020, according to findings by Harvard Kennedy School in September 2025. Yet, unlike the high school trends, Native people still graduate college at a much lower rate than the general American population. In 1990, 20.3% of all Americans had at least a college degree. In 2020, 34.3% of Americans had a college degree at a minimum , according to the Harvard Kennedy School findings. A professor at Navajo Technical University participates in a veterinary technology program conducted with the Department of Agriculture in 2019 in Crownpoint, N.M. Flickr/U.S. Department of Agriculture , CC BY A lasting impact While tribal colleges and universities receive state and federal funding, they are chronically underfunded and often operate in survival mode. In some cases, they lack money to make needed repairs on campus buildings . One major reason for this shortfall: While Congress agreed in the late 1970s to annually give tribal colleges $8,000 for each Native student they enroll, it has not met this financial and political commitment. Tribal colleges annually receive $250 million less than what the federal government promised them, a 2024 ProPublica investigation found. Tribal college and universities’ futures were cast in doubt in the spring of 2025, when the Trump administration announced a proposal to cut the Bureau of Indian Education’s annual budget from $183 million to $22 million . The Bureau of Indian Education is part of the Department of the Interior and oversees education for Native students. But the Department of Education went on to announce in September that it would make a one-time, $495 million investment in historically Black colleges and universities and TCUs. TCU leaders say they are still trying to understand the significance of this funding announcement and what it will result in . I think it is important to recognize that TCUs make broad contributions to society, well beyond the impact they have on individual students. TCUs teach entrepreneurship and business development and serve as pilot sites in launching businesses, for example. For every federal dollar invested in tribal colleges, the schools return $1.60 in tax revenue through the increased tax payments of their alumni and their alumni’s employers, according to a September 2025 report by the American Indian Higher Education Consortium, a national organization that represents TCUs. TCU alumni also generated $3.8 billion in added income, or gross domestic product, to the national economy from October 2022 through September 2023. These schools offer a unique pathway for Native students to attend a higher education institution, while teaching them the skills they need to build a stable career.",https://theconversation.com/tribal-colleges-and-universities-arent-well-known-but-are-a-crucial-steppingstone-for-native-students-261222,Society,BBC,Cynthia Lindquist,https://images.theconversation.com/files/694670/original/file-20251006-56-7xei94.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&rect=0%2C27%2C2047%2C1023&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop,2025-10-07T12:22:45+00:00,f3f4400574f7a9a74732c81ec4ffc5ef163e6082
07e4280838e1,The Supreme Court is headed toward a radically new vision of unlimited presidential power,"brett kavanaugh, clarence thomas, donald trump, executive orders, executive power, justice elena kagan, ronald reagan, sec, trump executive order, us attorney general, us federal reserve, us supreme court, us law, unitary executive theory","President Donald Trump set the tone for his second term by issuing 26 executive orders , four proclamations and 12 memorandums on his first day back in office. The barrage of unilateral presidential actions has not yet let up. These have included Trump’s efforts to remove thousands of government workers and fire several prominent officials , such as members of the Corporation for Public Broadcasting and the chair of the Commission on Civil Rights. He has also attempted to shut down entire agencies , such as the Department of Education and the U.S. Agency for International Development. For some scholars, these actions appear rooted in the psychology of an unrestrained politician with an overdeveloped ego . But it’s more than that. As a political science scholar who studies presidential power, I believe Trump’s recent actions mark the culmination of the unitary executive theory , which is perhaps the most contentious and consequential constitutional theory of the past several decades. A prescription for a potent presidency In 2017, Trump complained that the scope of his power as president was limited: “You know, the saddest thing is that because I’m the president of the United States, I am not supposed to be involved with the Justice Department. I am not supposed to be involved with the FBI, I’m not supposed to be doing the kind of things that I would love to be doing. And I’m very frustrated by it.” The unitary executive theory suggests that such limits wrongly curtail the powers of the chief executive. Formed by conservative legal theorists in the 1980s to help President Ronald Reagan roll back liberal policies, the unitary executive theory promises to radically expand presidential power. There is no widely agreed upon definition of the theory. And even its proponents disagree about what it says and what it might justify. But in its most basic version, the unitary executive theory claims that whatever the federal government does that is executive in nature – from implementing and enforcing laws to managing most of what the federal government does – the president alone should personally control it. This means the president should have total control over the entire executive branch , with its dozens of major governmental institutions and millions of employees. Put simply, the theory says the president should be able to issue orders to subordinates and to fire them at will. President Donald Trump signs executive orders in the Oval Office next to a poster displaying the Trump Gold Card on Sept. 19, 2025. AP Photo/Alex Brandon The president could boss around the FBI or order the U.S. attorney general to investigate his political opponents , as Trump has done. The president could issue signing statements – a written pronouncement – that reinterpret or ignore parts of the laws, like George W. Bush did in 2006 to circumvent a ban on torture . The president could control independent agencies such as the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Consumer Product Safety Commission. The president might be able to force the Federal Reserve to change interest rates, as Trump has suggested. And the president might possess inherent power to wage war as he sees fit without a formal authorization from Congress, as officials argued during Bush’s presidency. A constitutionally questionable doctrine A theory is one thing. But if it gains the official endorsement of the Supreme Court, it can become governing orthodoxy. It appears to many observers and scholars that Trump’s actions have intentionally invited court cases by which he hopes the judiciary will embrace the theory and thus permit him to do even more. And the current Supreme Court appears ready to grant that wish . Until recently, the judiciary tended to indirectly address the claims that now appear more formally as the unitary executive theory. During the country’s first two centuries, courts touched on aspects of the theory in cases such as Kendall v. U.S. in 1838, which limited presidential control of the postmaster general, and Myers v. U.S. in 1926, which held that the president could remove a postmaster in Oregon. In 1935, in Humphrey’s Executor v. U.S. , the high court unanimously held that Congress could limit the president’s ability to fire a commissioner of the Federal Trade Commission. And in Morrison v. Olson the court in 1988 upheld the ability of Congress to limit the president’s ability to fire an independent counsel. Some of those decisions aligned with some unitary executive claims, but others directly repudiated them. Warming up to a unitary executive In a series of cases over the past 15 years , the Supreme Court has moved in an unambiguously unitarian, pro-presidential direction . In these cases, the court has struck down statutory limits on the president’s ability to remove federal officials, enabling much greater presidential control. These decisions clearly suggest that long-standing, anti-unitarian landmark decisions such as Humphrey’s are on increasingly thin ice. In fact, in Justice Clarence Thomas’ 2019 concurring opinion in Seila Law LLC v. CFPB , where the court ruled the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau’s leadership structure was unconstitutional, he articulated his desire to “repudiate” the “erroneous precedent” of Humphrey’s. Several cases from the court’s emergency docket, or shadow docket , in recent months indicate that other justices share that desire. Such cases do not require full arguments but can indicate where the court is headed. In Trump v. Wilcox , Trump v. Boyle and Trump v. Slaughter , all from 2025, the court upheld Trump’s firing of officials from the National Labor Relations Board, the Merit Systems Protection Board, the Consumer Product Safety Commission and the Federal Trade Commission. Previously, these officials had appeared to be protected from political interference. President George W. Bush signed statements in 2006 to bypass a ban on torture. AP Photo/Pablo Martinez Monsivais, File Total control Remarks by conservative justices in those cases indicated that the court will soon reassess anti-unitary precedents. In Trump v. Boyle, Justice Brett Kavanaugh wrote, “whether this Court will narrow or overrule a precedent … there is at least a fair prospect (not certainty, but at least a reasonable prospect) that we will do so.” And in her dissent in Trump v. Slaughter, Justice Elena Kagan said the conservative majority was “raring” to overturn Humphrey’s and finally officially embrace the unitary executive. In short, the writing is on the wall, and Humphrey’s may soon go the way of Roe v. Wade and other landmark decisions that had guided American life for decades. As for what judicial endorsement of the unitary executive theory could mean in practice, Trump seems to hope it will mean total control and hence the ability to eradicate the so-called “ deep state .” Other conservatives hope it will diminish the government’s regulatory role. Kagan recently warned it could mean the end of administrative governance – the ways that the federal government provides services, oversees businesses and enforces the law – as we know it: “Humphrey’s undergirds a significant feature of American governance: bipartisan administrative bodies carrying out expertise-based functions with a measure of independence from presidential control. Congress created them … out of one basic vision. It thought that in certain spheres of government, a group of knowledgeable people from both parties – none of whom a President could remove without cause – would make decisions likely to advance the long-term public good.” If the Supreme Court officially makes the chief executive a unitary executive, the advancement of the public good may depend on little more than the whims of the president, a state of affairs normally more characteristic of dictatorship than democracy .",https://theconversation.com/the-supreme-court-is-headed-toward-a-radically-new-vision-of-unlimited-presidential-power-265840,Society,BBC,Graham G.

a743015e9ae8,Why free speech rights got left out of the Constitution – and added in later via the First Amendment,"articles of confederation, compromise, constitutional convention, fcc, first amendment, free speech, james madison, jimmy kimmel, us constitution","Bipartisan agreement is rare in these politically polarized days. But that’s just what happened in response to ABC’s suspension of “Jimmy Kimmel Live!” The suspension followed the Federal Communications Commission chairman’s threat to punish the network for Kimmel’s comments about Charlie Kirk’s alleged killer. It lit up the media. Democrats and civil libertarians denounced the FCC chairman Brendan Carr for violating the First Amendment’s guarantee of freedom of speech. Voices on the right , including Senator Ted Cruz , joined them. Within a week , Kimmel’s show was back on the air. While bipartisan agreement may be rare, it’s not surprising that it came in defense of the First Amendment – and a popular TV show. A recent poll found that a whopping 90% of respondents called the First Amendment “vital,” while 64% believed it’s so close to perfection that they wouldn’t change a word. In just 45 words, it bars Congress from establishing or preventing the free exercise of religion, interfering with the peoples’ right to assemble and petition, or abridging freedom of speech or the press. I’m a historian and scholar of modern U.S. law and politics . Here’s the story of why this amendment – now considered fundamental to American freedom and identity – wasn’t part of the original Constitution and how it was included later on . Added three years after the Constitution was ratified, it resulted from political compromise and a change of heart by framer James Madison . Handwritten revisions by senators during the process of altering and consolidating the amendments to the U.S. Constitution proposed by James Madison of Virginia. National Archives Soured on bills of rights Building a strong national government was the focus of Madison and the other delegates who met in Philadelphia in May 1787 to draft the Constitution . They believed the government created by the Articles of Confederation after the colonists declared independence was dysfunctional, and the nation was disintegrating. The government could not pay its debts, defend the frontier or protect commerce from interference by states and foreign governments. Although Madison and the other framers aimed to create a stronger national government, they cared about protecting liberty. Many had helped create state constitutions that included pioneering bills of rights. Madison himself played a critical role in securing passage in 1776 of the Virginia Declaration of Rights, a monument to civil liberties. By the time the Constitutional Convention met, however, Madison had soured on such measures. During the 1780s, he had watched with alarm as state legislatures trampled on rights explicitly guaranteed by their constitutions. Bills of rights, he concluded, weren’t sufficient to protect rights. So Madison and his colleagues put their faith in reinventing government . No appetite to haggle The Constitution they wrote created a government powerful enough to promote the national interests while maintaining a check on state legislatures. It also established a system of checks and balances that ensured federal power wasn’t abused. In the convention’s waning days, delegates briefly discussed adding a bill of rights but unanimously decided against it . They had sweated through almost four months of a sweltering Philadelphia summer and were ready to go home. When Virginia’s John Rutledge noted “the extreme anxiety of many members of the Convention to bring the business to an end ,” he was stating the obvious. With the Constitution in final form, few had the appetite to haggle over the provisions of a bill of rights. That decision nearly proved fatal when the Constitution went to the states for ratification. The new Constitution’s supporters, known as Federalists , faced fierce opposition from Anti-Federalists who charged that a powerful national government, unrestrained by a bill of rights, would inevitably lead to tyranny. Ratification conventions in three of the most critical states – Massachusetts, New York and Virginia – were narrowly divided; ratification hung in the balance. Federalists resisted demands to make ratification contingent on amendments suggested by state conventions. But they agreed to add a bill of rights – after the Constitution was ratified and took effect. That concession did the trick. A poster from 1959, published by the U.S. government, about the First Amendment. Stanley Dersh citizenship poster, U.S. Government Publishing Office via Reagan Library Harmless, possibly helpful The three critical states ratified without condition , and by midsummer 1788, the Constitution had been approved. However, when the First Congress met in March 1789, the Federalist majority didn’t prioritize a bill of rights. They had won and were ready to move on. Madison, now a Federalist leader in the House of Representatives, insisted that his party keep its word . He warned that failure to do so would undermine trust in the new government and give Anti-Federalists ammunition to demand a new convention to do what Congress had left undone. But Madison wasn’t just arguing for his party keeping its word. He had also changed his mind. The ratification debates and Madison’s correspondence with Thomas Jefferson led him to think differently about a bill of rights. He now thought it harmless and possibly helpful. Its provisions, Madison conceded, might become “ fundamental maxims of a free government ” and part of “the national sentiment.” Broad popular support for a bill of rights might provide a check on government officials and how they wielded power. Madison pushed his colleagues relentlessly. Wary of provisions that would weaken the national government, he developed a slate of amendments focused on individual rights. Ultimately, Congress approved 12 amendments – ensuring rights from freedom of speech to protection from cruel and unusual punishment – and sent them to the states for ratification. First Amendment no cure-all By the end of 1791, 10 of them – including the First Amendment ≠ had been ratified . As Madison anticipated, the First Amendment wasn’t a cure for a government bent on suppressing dissent. From the Sedition Act in the 1790s to McCarthyism in the 1950s and the Trump administration’s assault on the First Amendment, government has used its awesome powers to pursue and punish critics. On occasion, courts have intervened to protect First Amendment rights , a weapon Madison didn’t anticipate. But not always . Perhaps the ultimate protection for First Amendment rights is “national sentiment,” as Madison suggested. Norm-breaking presidents can disregard the law, and judges may cave. But public sentiment is a powerful force, as Jimmy Kimmel can attest.",https://theconversation.com/why-free-speech-rights-got-left-out-of-the-constitution-and-added-in-later-via-the-first-amendment-266639,Society,BBC,Donald Nieman,https://images.theconversation.com/files/694680/original/file-20251006-66-48n4fz.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&rect=0%2C419%2C7634%2C3817&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop,2025-10-07T12:19:58+00:00,96e9da3df6c4f52d6acfcc182572bc3a195ac777
45760fe3b63a,"Wings, booze and heartbreak – what my research says about the hidden costs of sports fandom","advertisements, beer, buffalo, cincinnati, eating, fandom, food, football, junk food, junk food advertising, mental health, nfl, new orleans, nutrition, physical health, research, sedentary lifestyles","Being from Buffalo means getting to eat some of the best wings in the world. It means scraping snow and ice off your car in frigid mornings. And it means making a lifelong vow to the city’s NFL franchise, the Bills – for better or worse, till death do us part. When I grew up in New York’s second-largest city, my community was bound together by loyalty to a football team that always found new ways to break our hearts . And yet at the start of each NFL season, we always found reasons to hope – we couldn’t help ourselves. Coming from this football-crazed culture, I often wondered about the psychology of fandom. This eventually led me to pursue a Ph.D. in sport consumer behavior. As a doctoral student, I was most interested in one question: Is fandom good for us? I found a huge body of research on the psychological and social effects of fandom, and it certainly made being devoted to a team look good. Fandom builds belonging , helps adults make friends , boosts happiness and even provides a buffer against traumatic life events . So, fandom is great, right? As famed football commentator Lee Corso would say: “ Not so fast, my friend .” While fandom appears to be a boon for our mental health, strikingly little research had been conducted on the relationship between fandom and physical health. So I decided to conduct a series of studies – mainly of people in Western countries – on this topic. I found that being a sports fan can have some drawbacks for physical health, especially among the most committed fans. Reach for the nachos Playing sports is healthy . But watching them? Not so much. Tailgating culture revolves around alcohol. Research shows that college sports fans binge drink at significantly higher rates than nonfans, are more likely to do something they later regretted and are more likely to drive drunk. Meanwhile, watch parties encourage being stationary for hours and mindlessly snacking. And, of course, fandom goes hand in hand with heavily processed foods like wings, nachos, pizza and hot dogs. One fan told me that when watching games, his relationship with food is “almost Pavlovian”; he craves “decadent” foods the same way he seeks out popcorn at the movies. Fans kick back to watch games at Caesars Palace Race and Sports Book in Las Vegas. George Rose/Getty Images Inside the stadium, healthy options have traditionally been scarce and overpriced. A Sports Illustrated writer joked in 1966 that fans leave stadiums and arenas with “the same body chemistry as a jelly doughnut.” Little seems to have changed since. One Gen Z fan I recently interviewed griped, “You might find one salad with a plain piece of lettuce and a quarter of a tomato.” Eating away the anxiety and pain The relationship between fandom and physical health isn’t just about guzzling beer, sitting for hours on end or scarfing down hot dogs. One study analyzed sales from grocery stores. The researchers found that fans consume more calories – and less healthy food – on the day following a loss by their favorite team, a reaction the researchers tied to stress and disappointment. My colleagues and I found something similar: Fandom induces what’s called “ emotional eating .” Emotions like anger, sadness and disappointment lead to stronger cravings . And this relationship is tied to how your favorite team performs when it matters most. For example, we found that games between rivals and closely contested games yield more pronounced effects. Emotional states generated by the game are also significantly correlated with increased beer sales in the stadium. High-calorie cultures In another paper, my co-authors and I found that fans often feel torn between their desire to make healthy choices and their commitment to being a “true fan.” Every fan base develops its own culture. These unwritten rules vary from team to team , and they aren’t just about wearing a cheesehead hat or waving a Terrible Towel . They also include expectations around drinking, eating and lifestyle. These health-related norms are shaped by a variety of factors, including the region’s culture, team history and even team sponsorships. For example, the Cincinnati Bengals partner with Skyline Chili , a regional chain that makes a meat sauce that’s often poured over hot dogs or spaghetti. One Bengals fan I interviewed observed that if you attend a Bengals game, sure, you could eat something else – but a “true fan” eats Skyline. I have two studies in progress that show how hardcore fans typically align their health behaviors with the health norms of their fan base. This becomes a way to signal their allegiance to the team , improve their standing among fellow fans, and contribute to what makes the fan base distinct in the eyes of its members. Cheese and sausages are synonymous with Wisconsin – and being a fan of the state’s NFL team, the Green Bay Packers. Jeff Haynes/AFP via Getty Images In Buffalo, for example, tailgating often revolves around alcohol – so much so that Bills fans have a reputation for over-the-top drinking rituals. And in New Orleans, Saints fans often link fandom to Louisiana food traditions. As one fan explained: “People make a bunch of fried food or huge pots of gumbo or étouffée, and eat all day – from hours before the game until hours after.” A new generation of health-conscious fans The fan experience is shaped by the culture in which it is embedded. Teams actively help shape these cultures, and there’s a business argument to be had for teams to play a bigger role in changing some of these norms. Gen Z is strikingly health-conscious . They’re also less engaged with traditional fandom . If stadiums and tailgates continue to revolve around beer and nachos, why would a generation attuned to fitness influencers and “ fitspiration ” buy in? To reach this market, I think the sports industry will need to promote its professional sports teams in new ways . Some teams are already doing so. The British soccer team Liverpool has partnered with the exercise equipment company Peloton. Another club, Manchester City, has teamed up with a nonalcoholic beer brand as the official sponsor of its practice uniforms. And several European soccer clubs have even joined a “ Healthy Stadia ” movement, revamping in-stadium food options and encouraging fans to walk and bike to the stadium. For the record, I don’t think the solution is replacing typical fan foods with smoothies and salads. Alienating core consumers is generally not a sound business strategy . I think it’s reasonable, however, to suggest sports teams might add more healthy options and carefully evaluate the signals they send through sponsorships. As one fan I recently interviewed said: “The NFL has had half-assed efforts like Play 60” – a campaign encouraging kids to get at least 60 minutes of physical activity per day – “while also making a ton of money from beer, food and, back in the day, cigarette advertisements. How can sports leagues seriously expect people to be healthier if they promote unhealthy behaviors?” Today’s consumers want to support brands that reflect their values. This is particularly true for Gen Zers, many of whom are savvy enough to see through hollow campaigns and quick to reject hypocrisy. In the long run, I think this type of dissonance – sandwiching a Play 60 commercial between ads for Uber Eats and Anheuser-Busch – will prove counterproductive. Relish, ketchup and mustard ‘race’ during a September 2025 baseball game between the Kansas City Royals and Seattle Mariners – an encapsulation of the dissonance between showcasing both physical activity and junk food at sporting events. Scott Winters/Icon Sportswire via Getty Images I, as much as anyone else, understand what makes fandom special – and yes, I’ve eaten my share of wings during Bills games. But public health is a pressing concern , and though the sports industry is well-positioned to address this issue , fandom isn’t helping. Actually, my research suggests it’s having the opposite effect. Striking the balance I’m advocating will be tricky, but the sports industry is filled with bright problem-solvers. In the film “ Moneyball ,” Brad Pitt’s character, Billy Beane, famously says sports teams must “ adapt or die .” He was referring to the need for baseball teams to integrate analytics into their decision-making. Professional sports teams eventually got that message. Maybe they’ll get this one, too.",https://theconversation.com/wings-booze-and-heartbreak-what-my-research-says-about-the-hidden-costs-of-sports-fandom-265158,Society,BBC,Aaron Mansfield,https://images.theconversation.com/files/694634/original/file-20251006-56-606dkz.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&rect=0%2C1241%2C4816%2C2408&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop,2025-10-07T12:19:23+00:00,0835453f157c6be5164098426050f1c4bdcf930f
3f41afe8b068,What I Want the Comedians Who Went to Saudi Arabia to Know,,"Let’s start with the good news: As an exercise in artwashing, the Riyadh Comedy Festival was a complete failure. The Saudi regime spends billions of dollars promoting cultural and sporting events in an effort to distract from its endless human rights abuses. This time, it only succeeding in drawing attention to them. Performers at the event, which ran from Sept. 26 to Oct. 9, faced a torrent of criticism from NGOs and, more pertinently, from their fellow comedians. Arrested Development star David Cross wrote , “I am disgusted, and deeply disappointed in this whole gross thing,” condemning artists willing to “condone this totalitarian fiefdom” for a huge paycheck. British comedian Stewart Lee took aim at the “evil, amoral, grifting bastards” taking Saudi money to perform. Let’s start with the good news: As an exercise in artwashing, the Riyadh Comedy Festival was a complete failure.

British comedian Stewart Lee took aim at the “evil, amoral, grifting bastards” taking Saudi money to perform. Writing in the Carnegie Endowment, Tulane University Professor Andrew Leber noted that “there has been far more discussion of freedom of speech in Saudi Arabia in the past two weeks than when the Saudi government executed a journalist on national-security grounds in June.” That journalist, Turki al-Jasser, founded online news outlet Al-Mashhad Al-Saudi (The Saudi Scene) but it is common knowledge among the dissident community that the real reason he was arrested, tortured, convicted on terrorism charges, and executed was his anonymous satirical Twitter account poking fun at the regime. Like all dictators, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman is terrified of comedians, and having a laugh at his expense is a capital crime. Saudi Arabia is suffering an unprecedented execution crisis. Last year, authorities executed 345 people . Previously, the most executions in a calendar year was 196 in 2022. This year, the regime is on pace to smash its own blood-soaked record. At the time of writing there have been at least 292 executions in a little over nine months. In 2023, Reprieve and the European Saudi Organization for Human Rights analyzed over a decade’s worth of execution data. In the five years before bin Salman and his father, King Salman, took power, the average number of executions was 71 per year. This year, the regime is on course to kill almost 400—a fivefold increase that remains shockingly underreported. You wouldn’t hear about this at the festival, of course. Comedian Atsuko Okatsuka posted the contract she was offered (and declined), which explicitly prohibited any comic material ridiculing the Saudi royal family, government, legal system, religion, or culture. Jim Jefferies was dropped from the bill after a stray comment about a reporter “killed by the government”—an apparent reference to assassinated Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi. The performers who did accept gave well-rehearsed justifications. The most honest admitted to being mercenaries. “They’re paying me enough money to look the other way,” said Tim Dillon. Pete Davidson candidly acknowledged: “I see the number, and I go, ‘I’ll go.’” Dave Chappelle sought to portray his critics as hypocritical, riffing in his set that “it’s easier to talk here than it is in America.” While there may be a grain of truth in this when the Trump administration is pressuring networks to take comedians poking the president off the air, in Saudi Arabia, anyone telling the sort of jokes about the nation’s rulers that got Jimmy Kimmel and Stephen Colbert into trouble would be in a torture cell faster than you can say “free speech.” Other performers insisted they had noble intentions. Louis C.K. claimed the festival was contributing to the “opening up” of a closed society. Omid Djalili put it like this: “Allowing international performances in Saudi, especially comedy, subtly broadens what’s thinkable and sayable in a society. Every laugh at a taboo subject shifts norms, albeit slightly.” Again, this is half true. Young Saudis enjoy freedoms their parents dared not dream of, but these come at an extremely high cost, and with strict limits. The enforced social contract between the Saudi government and its citizens mirrors the contract offered to performers at the comedy festival: Whatever you do, you must never, ever criticize the authorities. U.S. comedians who flouted the terms were uninvited; Saudi citizens who break the rules end up dead. This is the gaping flaw in the self-interested reasoning of Aziz Ansari, who claimed to have “put a lot of thought into” whether or not to appear at the festival. “There’s people over there that don’t agree with the stuff that the government’s doing,” he told Deadline , “and to ascribe the worst behavior of the government onto those people, that’s not fair.” I was forced to flee Saudi Arabia and live in exile because I “don’t agree with the stuff that the government’s doing.” Turki al-Jasser and Jamal Khashoggi were killed because they sometimes didn’t agree either. In August, Jalal al-Labbad was executed for the “crime” of attending demonstrations calling for basic human rights when he was 15 years old. His brother Fadel was executed in 2019, also for protest-related offenses. A third brother, Mohammad, is on death row, at imminent risk of execution. In August, his death sentence was upheld, alongside that of child defendant Youssef al-Manasif—another kid rounded up for allegedly attending a protest, tortured into making a false confession and charged with terror offenses. Jimmy Carr talks about being a “ free speech absolutist ,” but has just been handsomely paid to launder the reputation of an authoritarian regime with zero tolerance for dissent. In Saudi Arabia, telling the wrong kind of joke can have severe, even fatal consequences. Salman al-Ouda faces a death sentence for “ sarcasm and mockery of the government’s achievements.” There were only eight executions in Saudi Arabia during the two weeks of the festival. I say “only” because this was a relatively quiet period for 2025, in which executions have averaged more than one per day. Two were for non-violent drug crimes, two were for murder, and three were for protest-related crimes, including Mohammed Al-Ammar, who was executed on the final day of the festival, for “terrorism” offenses related to taking part in demonstrations and sit-ins in Qatif, during the Arab Spring. So what should artists and athletes invited to Saudi Arabia do? We are not saying they must boycott the kingdom: Saudis deserve to watch great performances and elite sport, and whether to perform there is a matter of personal conscience. But we do say these performers and athletes must come with their eyes open, admit they are helping to normalize a brutal and repressive regime, and expect to be criticized. We need more global stars with the courage of Formula One champion Lewis Hamilton, who raced in Saudi Arabia and drew attention to executions of child defendants while he was there. The boy he mentioned, Abdullah al-Howaiti, has been imprisoned since he was arrested and tortured at age 14, and remains on death row. He could be executed at any time.

7d718aca05ab,Will Venezuela’s Nobel Peace Prize Winner Stick With Trump?,,"In a public statement made shortly after winning the 2025 Nobel Peace Prize, Venezuelan democratic activist María Corina Machado pledged that she would dedicate the award to U.S. President Donald Trump. It wasn’t just an effort to salve the U.S. president’s famously thin skin after he had sought the prize for himself. Machado’s gesture was also indicative of her personal stake in the U.S. administration’s military buildup in the Caribbean—and the tightrope that she will need to walk in support of Trump’s approach toward the autocratic regime of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro. Machado has supported Trump’s efforts in the region, including the killing of alleged narcotics traffickers without evidence or due process . In a public statement made shortly after winning the 2025 Nobel Peace Prize, Venezuelan democratic activist María Corina Machado pledged that she would dedicate the award to U.S. President Donald Trump. It wasn’t just an effort to salve the U.S. president’s famously thin skin after he had sought the prize for himself. Machado’s gesture was also indicative of her personal stake in the U.S. administration’s military buildup in the Caribbean—and the tightrope that she will need to walk in support of Trump’s approach toward the autocratic regime of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro. Machado has supported Trump’s efforts in the region, including the killing of alleged narcotics traffickers without evidence or due process . “This is about saving lives,” she told Fox News in early September after the United States began its bombing campaign. But can a Nobel Peace Prize laureate continue to endorse a policy that many argue is in violation of international law? And what about if the United States escalated its campaign and Venezuela’s national sovereignty were violated, albeit in the name of democracy? It was during the administration of former U.S. President Joe Biden that Machado rode out of the ranks of a divided democratic opposition to become the face of a broad popular movement rejecting Maduro’s rule. At the time, the Biden administration—in a policy that infuriated many members of Venezuela’s opposition movement—engaged with the Maduro government and selectively lifted the “maximum pressure” sanctions imposed by Trump in 2019. The idea was to incentivize the Maduro regime into convening a competitive presidential election in 2024 , as required by the Venezuelan Constitution. While U.S. and international carrots and sticks pressured the Maduro government into permitting a privately organized national opposition primary that overwhelmingly elected Machado as its presidential candidate, the Maduro-controlled Supreme Court quickly barred Machado from running. Machado campaigned on behalf of her stand-in , Edmundo González. Then, when the election was held on July 28, 2024, it was brazenly stolen by Maduro. And in November 2024, a Democratic administration was not returned to the White House. Once back in the Oval Office, Trump shifted tack on Maduro to a martial response, declaring him and his government “narco-terrorists.” Under that vague but provocative designation, the U.S. Defense Department mobilized a fleet of more than eight boats, a nuclear-powered submarine, and more than 10,000 personnel in the southern Caribbean.. Shortly after taking up position, the fleet blew up at least four boats and their crews, who the United States alleged were narcotics traffickers. More recently, Trump has signaled that he may direct the forces to attack land-based targets in Venezuela. These are actions designed to rattle Maduro’s inner circle enough that they oust him from the presidential palace in Caracas and spark a transition to democracy . The Venezuelan opposition’s frustration, and its seeming willingness to go along with Trump’s potentially extraterritorial scheme, is understandable. After Maduro proclaimed himself reelected —without releasing any evidence to support his claim—the regime initiated a massive crackdown against peaceful demonstrators, during which more than 2,000 protesters were arrested and at least 24 killed . Despite widespread international opposition to the elections (minus, of course, countries such as China, Iran, Nicaragua, North Korea, and Russia, which rushed to embrace the stolen election’s result) and the government-sanctioned bloodshed that followed, Maduro’s regime proved persistent. International attention on Venezuela soon faded, and its regional neighbors—Brazil and Colombia—quietly slunk away from any responsibility. After a long, tense campaign in which Machado and her advisors were harassed and some were arrested, the stolen election, and the inability (or in some cases, unwillingness) of the international community to exert meaningful pressure on the Maduro regime, many in the opposition concluded that even a semi-democratic path toward change was impossible. Out of desperation, perhaps, Machado and others returned to their calls for the military to defect and thereby remove Maduro and his corrupt cronies from power. Such calls included embracing Trump’s policy killing of Venezuelan civilians whom he claims were drug traffickers, or as he calls them, “narco-terrorists.” While speculation around the Nobel committee’s decision to award Machado has focused on whether this was a consolation prize for Trump—in that it indirectly gives a nod of support to his hard-line policies on Venezuela—there’s another interpretation, too. The Norwegian award committee cited Machado’s “tireless work promoting democratic rights for the people of Venezuela” and her commitment to a “just and peaceful transition from dictatorship to democracy.” The announcement’s language can be interpreted as both an endorsement of her battle on the 2024 campaign trail—and also a warning over her support for less-than-peaceful and less-than-democratic means for regime change. A Nobel Peace Prize rewards commitment to international law and peace over conflict. There is a strong probability that the Trump administration’s Venezuela policy, whether via a palace coup or a targeted bombing campaign, will stoke more violence, bloodshed, and chaos. Venezuela’s military is deeply riddled with corruption; when you combine that with the presence of Colombian insurgent groups, illicit gold mining in the Orinoco region, and armed pro-government militias (the so-called “ colectivos ”), it’s easy to see how a spark of violence could open up a broader struggle across the country among and by these criminal networks. The Trump administration has justified its military escalation off the Venezuelan coast by depicting the Maduro government as a corrupt, illegal regime run by a cartel of narco-terrorists, and some segments of the opposition have embraced this. Yet if that’s true, then neither a palace coup nor a U.S. military strike that takes out the leadership will be sufficient for democratic change. A bloodless coup in the regime of a so-called narco-terrorist is an oxymoron. This is particularly true in a country such as Venezuela, in which—as the opposition and the Trump administration have correctly argued—the state has been deeply penetrated by illicit activities and transnational criminal networks, including Colombian insurgents , and the military has colluded in activities ranging from illegal gold mining to narcotics trafficking. The Nobel Prize has shone a spotlight on the plight of Venezuelans in their decades-long struggle to use democratic means to unseat a criminal regime. But does the failure of those pathways justify military strikes? As a long-standing civic activist, first with the election-monitoring group Súmate and later as an opposition leader, Machado has become the hero of popular resistance to the regime. What kind of change this movement wants after the electoral option was shut down last year remains unclear. One possibility is for Machado to offer a nonviolent, non-U.S. militarily led transition—one around which other countries could rally and which seeks to curb the risk of spiraling violence. This is tricky terrain for Venezuela’s new Nobel Prize laureate as she seeks to both soothe Trump’s ego and address the urgent pleas of her popular movement and the citizens of Venezuela.",https://foreignpolicy.com/2025/10/15/venezuela-machado-nobel-peace-prize-trump,Opinion,BBC,Christopher Sabatini,https://foreignpolicy.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/maria-machado-GettyImages-2193162966.jpg?w=1000,2025-10-17T00:00:00,f3485a6122a25d3b862d39c2bf02295d607ca2fe
d81de4cd969d,China’s Rare-Earth Flex Sends the United States Scrambling,,"Welcome to Foreign Policy ’s China Brief. The highlights this week: China announces major rare-earth export controls , Washington and Beijing begin charging steep tit-for-tat port fees , and a British espionage case involving China collapses. Sign up to receive China Brief in your inbox every Tuesday. Chinese Export Controls Put Pressure on U.S. Trade Strategy After China announced major new export controls on rare earths and related products last Thursday, U.S. President Donald Trump responded by promising 100 percent tariffs on all products from China starting Nov. 1. Trump adopted a more conciliatory tone after seeing U.S. markets fall on Friday, but his threat remains in place. China’s export controls, which apply to all countries, are a blow to both U.S. defense supply chains and global industry . As RAND analyst Gerard DiPippo points out , China’s latest moves are part of a broader system of controls built to mirror the U.S. sanctions regime. China is using the same rules on foreign direct products that the United States has applied since 1959. Realizing how powerful the U.S. economic security regime was arguably drove China to create a system of its own, and Trump’s bluster is unlikely to dissuade Beijing from making further use of such a powerful tool. China’s next moves will depend on how its leadership reads Trump. A serious, sustained threat to reimpose tariffs is a very different thing from another round of “ Trump always chickens out ”—the notion, which Chinese commentators have already latched on to , that the U.S. president abandons threats as soon as he faces consequences for making them. Traders certainly seem to be thinking along those lines, with markets rebounding since Trump took a softer tone. Trump still wants a meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping, and behind the scenes, U.S. officials seem to be keeping diplomatic channels running. On Monday, U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said China had “substantially de-escalated,” despite Beijing not changing its public position on the exports. The problem for the Trump administration is that trade threats will likely hurt the United States more than China. Since Trump launched the trade war this year, Chinese exporters have had considerable success finding new markets. Last month, China’s year-over-year exports to the United States fell by 27 percent , but exports as a whole were still up by 8.3 percent. In contrast, U.S. farmers have not found new buyers for their soybeans—while Brazilian producers have stepped in , perhaps permanently, as a replacement in the Chinese market. This year has also exposed how many U.S. businesses are dependent on China. The holiday season is coming, and price spikes could cause consumer anger: Between 73 and 78 percent of toys and 85 and 90 percent of Christmas goods sold in the United States are made in China . Beijing is reportedly confident that it won the first round of the trade conflict with Washington; this latest exchange is unlikely to convince Chinese officials otherwise. China’s rare-earth stranglehold will thus remain a serious constraint on U.S. action. The United States ignored more than a decade of warnings about this problem. Now, the U.S. Defense Department is scrambling to build a $1 billion critical minerals stockpile, which will be difficult to do without Chinese sources. A better strategy might be to heed the advice of former Chinese Finance Minister Deng Xiaoping: Hide your strength and bide your time. Breaking China’s grip on rare earths is possible , but visibly panicking about it could encourage Beijing to act while it still holds the upper hand. What We’re Following Port wars. Another U.S.-China struggle is playing out at sea. Beginning on Tuesday, the United States is charging additional port fees for ships built, owned, or operated by Chinese firms. The current fee for Chinese-owned or -operated ships is $50 per ton and will rise to $140 per ton by 2028. China has imposed similar tit-for-tat measures on U.S.-linked ships but has exempted ships built in China. The impact could be painful for both shipping and trade. Even a small container ship can weigh 20,000 tons. For large ones that weigh more than 200,000 tons, total port costs could start as high as $10 million. As with tariffs, these costs are likely to be passed on to consumers. Through these port fees, the Trump administration hopes to bring shipbuilding back to the United States, but it has a long way to go. China currently dominates the shipbuilding market, accounting for a 53.3 percent share, followed by South Korea (29.1 percent). The United States, meanwhile, makes up only 0.1 percent of the market. China is taking additional strides to widen its lead, announcing new measures this week targeting South Korean shipbuilders tied to the United States. U.K. spy case. The British government’s case against two U.K. citizens accused of spying for China collapsed last month, reportedly because the government refused to formally classify China as a national security threat. The Crown Prosecution Service asked the government for evidence of that classification for months but received no response. That is strange, given that Britain’s MI5 recently warned that members of Parliament are being targeted by Chinese spies. For the last two decades, British policy toward China has reflected thwarted economic hopes and frequent diplomatic clashes, especially over Hong Kong . It’s not clear whether government obfuscation in this case was deliberate or incompetent. Despite opposition leader Kemi Badenoch attempting to blame the Labour government, the case began in 2023 when Conservatives were still in power. The NBA returns. After six years of ruptured relations largely tied to freedom of speech concerns, a more cautious National Basketball Association (NBA) is returning to China—the U.S. league’s most important overseas market. The Brooklyn Nets and the Phoenix Suns will play two preseason games this weekend in Macao, the semiautonomous territory in China’s south known for its casinos. FP’s Rishi Iyengar writes about the fraught history of this relationship—and what comes next. FP’s Most Read This Week Tech and Business EV fires. Like many firms in China, phone giant Xiaomi got into the electric vehicle race last year. But it’s now facing a public relations crisis after images of one of its signature SU7 models engulfed in flames circulated on Chinese social media. The footage was captured after a fatal collision in Chengdu in which the vehicle’s doors could not be opened to rescue the person inside. On Monday, Xiaomi’s stock dropped by more than 5 percent. EV-linked fires have become a major issue in China, and the solutions so far—including one system that violently ejects batteries from the vehicle—seem more dangerous than the problem itself. Fires among charging vehicles have prompted bans in some apartment complexes, though e-bikes have so far proved to be a bigger danger than cars. Vertical dramas. Chinese cultural exports are notoriously lacking despite the country’s size, but Western media producers are investing in a new video format that was pioneered in China: vertical dramas. With episodes as short as a minute, vertical dramas are designed to be watched on phones by an audience loyal to short-form video apps such as Douyin and TikTok. The first few episodes of vertical dramas are often free, but viewers must pay fees to keep watching once they’re hooked. This model has created a $7 billion market in China that Western studios want to imitate in their own countries. This is somewhat baffling to me because the few free episodes I’ve watched seem poorly produced and full of cliches. Notably, the U.S. firm Quibi tried a similar approach a few years ago, but it was a flop , burning through $1.75 billion in capital investment before shutting down two years after its founding. Maybe it was just ahead of its time, or maybe even its eight- to 10-minute episodes were still too long for an audience with atrophied attention spans.",https://foreignpolicy.com/2025/10/14/china-trade-rare-earth-export-control-united-states-trump-tariffs,Opinion,BBC,James Palmer,https://foreignpolicy.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/china-trade-GettyImages-2239867163.jpg?w=1000,2025-10-17T00:00:00,4aae039a836fc0604e1b39c4e485883a7ecd49b9
43103716aadf,The NBA’s Long Road Back to China,,"The National Basketball Association (NBA) returned to China after a six-year hiatus this weekend, staging two preseason games between the Phoenix Suns and the Brooklyn Nets in Macau—the semi-autonomous territory in the country’s south that is best known for its casinos. It was in one of those casinos—the Venetian , owned by U.S. billionaire Miriam Adelson—that the Suns and Nets played in front of a of thousands of Chinese fans. That fandom was built over much of the past two decades, a love affair that began in 2002 when the Houston Rockets drafted 7-foot-6-inch Chinese player Yao Ming. Yao went on to have a stellar career (eight-time All-Star, Hall of Famer) during which hundreds of millions of people in China became NBA fans. The National Basketball Association (NBA) returned to China after a six-year hiatus this weekend, staging two preseason games between the Phoenix Suns and the Brooklyn Nets in Macau—the semi-autonomous territory in the country’s south that is best known for its casinos.

Yao went on to have a stellar career (eight-time All-Star, Hall of Famer) during which hundreds of millions of people in China became NBA fans. The league cashed in aggressively, hosting more than two dozen preseason games in China between 2004 and 2019—not to mention the frequent visits and basketball camps by superstars such as Kobe Bryant and LeBron James . A 2022 analysis by ESPN valued the NBA’s China business at around $5 billion. It was days before James’s last preseason tour of China with the Los Angeles Lakers in 2019 that it all fell apart. Daryl Morey, the general manager of the Rockets at the time, tweeted a message of solidarity with pro-democracy protesters in Hong Kong , another semi-autonomous territory—just a short ferry ride away from Macau—that China has increasingly tightened its grip on. Morey’s tweet, which read “Fight For Freedom. Stand with Hong Kong,” was quickly deleted, but the damage was done. Chinese broadcasters stopped showing NBA games, local sponsorship deals collapsed, and James’s preseason games in China the following week (also against the Nets) would end up being the NBA’s last—until now. The NBA-China dustup coincided with a particularly fraught period in China’s relationship with the United States. U.S. President Donald Trump’s aggressive trade war and tech curbs against China were the cornerstone of his first term in office, which ended a little more than a year after the NBA controversy. His hawkish stance against Beijing was largely continued by former President Joe Biden from 2021 to 2025. Since Trump’s return to the White House in January this year, his China policy has been more mercurial, marked by sudden escalations that have been mostly walked back . In the meantime, China has weaponized its leverage , and Trump appears eager to cut a deal. China has also shown a willingness to leverage its soft power tools, such as its status as the world’s purveyor of popular and cuddly pandas and its ownership of the hugely popular social media app TikTok , to put U.S. leaders in awkward positions. But soft power keeps reasserting itself. The pandas , which China withdrew from Washington’s Smithsonian National Zoo in 2023 were replaced with new ones a year later. And TikTok has been at least temporarily saved from going dark in the United States. Chinese state broadcaster CCTV, meantime, quietly resumed showing NBA games a little more than three years ago—even as Washington and Beijing escalated their diplomatic, military, and technological great power competition. The choice of Macau as a venue for the weekend’s preseason games (only its second time hosting them since 2004) stems in part from capitalistic realism. Casino executive Patrick Dumont, whose billionaire mother-in-law—the aforementioned Adelson—also happens to be one of Trump’s biggest donors, reportedly lobbied to stage the games there. But there’s also a degree of symbolism involved. Macau represents a similar China-but-not-quite-China status as Hong Kong, which precipitated the whole NBA firestorm six years ago. Both territories are ruled under a principle called “one country, two systems,” which allows them a degree of autonomy despite Chinese control. Macau’s hosting of the preseason games—part of a five-year deal with Adelson’s company Las Vegas Sands—also allows the NBA to dip its toe back into the Chinese market, where at its peak, the league was watched by some 500 million people . It remains to be seen whether that opens the door to bring games back to mainland Chinese metropolises such as Beijing, Shanghai, and Shenzhen, as was common in the preceding decades. But for now, at least basketball is back.",https://foreignpolicy.com/2025/10/14/nba-china-macau-games-adelson-hong-kong-morey,Opinion,BBC,Rishi Iyengar,https://foreignpolicy.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/GettyImages-2240220872.jpg?w=1000,2025-10-17T00:00:00,3a27b8decfeed3ab353bf0a81dac793916a0dec8

Sign up to receive World Brief in your inbox every weekday. Maintaining the Truce Israeli forces opened fire on Palestinians in northern Gaza on Tuesday, killing at least six people. According to the Israeli military, troops targeted suspects who crossed the U.S.-negotiated “yellow line,” the boundary for Israel’s partial withdrawal from the territory. Israeli officials said this threat violated the agreed-upon terms of an Israel-Hamas peace deal that went into effect four days ago. However, a Palestinian news agency reported on Tuesday that Israeli drones had fired on residents inspecting their homes. It is unclear whether this attack is the same one that Israel cited as a defense of the yellow line . The incident came just one day after top mediators, including U.S. President Donald Trump, convened in Egypt to sign the Gaza cease-fire deal. During a state address to Israel’s Knesset on Monday, Trump made clear that he expects Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to adhere to the truce in Gaza. Israel unilaterally broke the war’s last cease-fire arrangement in March. Israel and Hamas also enacted the two sides’ long-anticipated hostage exchange deal on Monday. Hamas freed all 20 living captives in Gaza and four deceased hostages, just before Israel released nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners and detainees. Publicly, Israel expressed outrage over Hamas’s failure to return the remains of the other 24 killed hostages, as dictated by the U.S.-brokered deal. But privately, Israeli officials appear to recognize that may take time, as some of the bodies could be under rubble or in areas that Hamas no longer controls. According to United Nations satellite imagery, more than 80 percent of Gaza’s structures have been damaged or destroyed in the conflict. Now, negotiators in Egypt are discussing the cease-fire deal’s next steps. Three key issues remain on the agenda: 1. Hamas’s disarmament. Israel demands that the group fully demilitarizes, and local sources have accused militants of already working to retake control of Israeli-vacated areas. Some sources close to the talks have suggested that Hamas may consider partial disarmament but remains opposed to total demilitarization. 2. Gaza’s future governance. Hamas has agreed to relinquish control of Gaza to a Palestinian technocratic government, but only if it is supervised by the Palestinian Authority, which already governs parts of the occupied West Bank, and is not subject to foreign rule. This goes against Trump’s 20-point plan , which stipulates that the territory’s government would be overseen by an international transitional body. 3. Rebuilding the enclave. With more than 67,000 Palestinians killed, hundreds of thousands of people requiring humanitarian aid , and nearly all of Gaza’s 2.1 million residents displaced, revitalizing the war-torn territory is expected to be an expensive and arduous task. This may be hampered by Israel’s announcement that it will not reopen the Rafah border crossing between Gaza and Egypt on Wednesday. Allowing increased aid to enter the enclave is a stipulation of the peace deal. Today’s Most Read What We’re Following A new U.S.-China fight. China and the United States rolled out new port fees on ocean shipping firms on Tuesday, adding fresh tensions to their escalating trade war. The additional costs are expected to hamper supply chains between the world’s two largest economies and could threaten an upcoming summit between Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping in South Korea. Trump kicked off the trade war with China in March, triggering several rounds of negotiations to bring tariff rates down from triple-figure heights. But tensions intensified last Friday, when the U.S. president threatened a fresh round of 100 percent tariffs over Beijing’s decision to expand its export controls for rare earths and related technologies; these new controls are set to take effect in November and December. On top of these duties, Trump has levied fees on commercial ships linked to China, citing a Biden-era investigation that found that Beijing uses unfair policies to dominate global maritime, logistics, and shipbuilding sectors. China responded by imposing special charges on U.S.-owned, operated, built, or flagged vessels. Chinese-built vessels will be exempt from the measures. “If the U.S. chooses confrontation, China will see it through to the end,” China’s Commerce Ministry said on Tuesday. “If it chooses dialogue, China’s door remains open.” France delays pension reform. On Tuesday, French Prime Minister Sébastien Lecornu proposed suspending a landmark pension reform plan until after the 2027 presidential election, bowing to left-wing pressure in an effort to maintain his precarious grip on power. The move deals a damning blow to President Emmanuel Macron, who made pension reform (including an increased retirement age) a key pillar of his economic platform. Macron enacted his pension reform in April 2023, sparking mass anti-government protests that catalyzed the start of France’s most tumultuous political cycle in the country’s modern history. In less than two years, Macron has burned through five prime ministers, with Lecornu himself resigning last week after just 26 days in office—only to be reappointed four days later. Lawmakers from the far left and far right have demanded that Macron call snap elections and step down before his five-year term ends. But by slimming down the nation’s 2026 budget proposal, the French prime minister appears to be trying a different tactic to appease the opposition and revive a deadlocked National Assembly. That may not be enough to save Macron’s administration, though, as Lecornu will face two votes of confidence motions expected later this week. Claiming victory in Cameroon. Opposition candidate Issa Tchiroma has unilaterally declared victory in Cameroon’s Sunday presidential election . “The people have chosen, and this choice must be respected,” Tchiroma said in a speech posted to Facebook on Tuesday, urging 92-year-old President Paul Biya to concede defeat and end his 43 years in office. Biya was seeking an eighth term when Tchiroma, a former government spokesperson, broke ranks to campaign on a fight against economic stagnation in the African country. At least 43 percent of Cameroon’s population lives in poverty, according to the United Nations. While some presidential candidates have already congratulated Tchiroma, Cameroon’s government has not yet issued an official response to Tchiroma’s claim. Territorial Administration Minister Paul Atanga Nji reminded voters this week that only the country’s Constitutional Council can determine the winner ; the council has until Oct. 26 to make an announcement. In his speech, Tchiroma lauded supporters for defying voter intimidation efforts, and he called on Biya’s administration to accept the results or else risk nationwide unrest . “Either it shows greatness by accepting the truth of the ballot box, or it chooses to plunge the country into turmoil that will leave an indelible scar in the heart of our nation,” Tchiroma warned.

16dbb7760401,Beijing’s Coded Editorials Reveal Big Economic Plans,,"On Sept. 30, as Chinese citizens prepared for a “ Golden Week ” holiday, People’s Daily , the flagship newspaper of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), launched a carefully timed editorial campaign . For several consecutive days, its second page, reserved for authoritative commentaries, carried essays under the banner “Special Series on China’s Economy Under the Guidance of Xi Jinping Economic Thought.” Each was signed with the pseudonym Zhong Caiwen. In China’s political communication system, such pseudonyms are not random. They are signals, collective voices for CCP organs to articulate and test major policy directions. First appearing in People’s Daily in 2024, the name “Zhong Caiwen” itself is a homophonous construct: “Zhong” connotes “central,” “Cai” refers to finance and economics, and “wen” means “article” or “commentary.” It likely represents the collective voice of the Central Commission for Financial and Economic Affairs (CCFEA), the CCP’s top economic policymaking body. Similarly, unnamed sources, used in parallel with the pseudonym system and featured as interviewees in official outlets, also play a signaling role. In 2015, while then-Premier Li Keqiang was on a foreign trip, People’s Daily published an interview with an unnamed “authoritative person,” widely understood to be CCFEA head Liu He. That piece advocated “supply-side structural reform” and signaled a shift in policy emphasis toward deleveraging and efficiency for years to come. The use of such roundabout methods reflects a long-standing culture of ambiguity and allusion in Chinese politics that shapes the CCP’s propaganda work. The practice also allows official messaging to carry institutional authority while softening its tone for a public increasingly attuned to more pluralistic and media-savvy discourse. From the 1960s onward, successive CCP leaderships have relied on pseudonymous writing groups to articulate guiding principles or to prepare the ground for major policy transitions. Examples range from Mao Zedong-era commentaries during the Sino-Soviet split to the “Huang Fuping” essays in Jiefang Daily that helped restart reform after 1989. In recent years, the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection, for instance, has published under the pseudonym Zhong Jixuan to communicate its disciplinary priorities and shape public understanding of anti-corruption campaigns. Many observers have dismissed the series as little more than political pageantry, designed to drum up economic confidence and set a positive tone. That reading isn’t wrong, but it’s incomplete. What the essays lack in novelty, they make up for in clarity. Read together, the new essays offer one of the most structured explanations yet of how China’s leadership views its economic transition: not as a response to crisis but as a deliberate reorganization of priorities for an era defined by slower growth, geopolitical constraints, and structural maturation. The early essays in the Zhong Caiwen series build a unified conceptual foundation for the main economic message that follows. The first piece situates China’s trajectory in a world of volatility. It argues that the ability to maintain strategic composure amid geopolitical uncertainty is now a form of comparative advantage. The subtext is that the world may be unpredictable but China’s model, anchored in planning and continuity, is well positioned to stay on course. The second essay traces that stability to institutional architecture. It highlights party leadership, theoretical adaptability, long-term planning, and the fusion of state coordination with market mechanisms as mutually reinforcing, touting what might be called a “managed equilibrium”—a system that, according to the author, is superior. The third piece turns to the present and has an unusually candid tone. It openly acknowledges a series of economic headwinds, including weak domestic demand, fiscal pressures on local governments, deflationary tendencies, and persistent “supply-demand mismatch.” Such direct enumeration of risks is notable in central CCP media and suggests an effort to manage expectations ahead of the 15th Five-Year Plan discussions, at the Fourth Plenum meeting this month. Yet the essay’s rhetorical pivot is equally striking: Rather than framing these weaknesses as structural failures, it casts them as transitional symptoms of technological upgrading and industrial realignment. The message is that the current “pain points” are the by-products of necessary transformation, not indicators of systemic malaise. The reassurance thus projects confidence while preparing both domestic and international audiences for a period of slower but more stable adjustment, reinterpreting the slowdown as evidence of transformation, an economy enduring short-term friction in exchange for long-term resilience. A similar message was reinterpreted in the final pieces, where the series closes by defining “certainty” itself as a growth asset and portraying China as a force for global good. It touts China’s achievements in poverty reduction, green development, and openness through initiatives such as the Belt and Road Initiative while urging the world to look past ideological divides and view China’s rise on its own terms. Against a backdrop of political turnover and policy volatility in the West, it argues that China’s strength lies in its ability to sustain direction and coherence. The middle installment on Oct. 3, “China’s Economic Transformation and Upgrading Contain Major Opportunities,” goes into operational detail. It identifies traditional sectors such as chemicals, machinery, textiles, and light industry as the backbone of a still-dominant industrial base that must be upgraded, rather than replaced. Automation, digitalization, and environmental retrofitting are positioned as the mechanisms that can turn legacy industries into productive laboratories. At the same time, advanced manufacturing, artificial intelligence, robotics, and biopharma are elevated as the new pillars of “industrial self-reliance.” This clarifies the party’s dual goals: preserving social stability through continuity of employment while gradually shifting China’s manufacturing system up the value chain. Innovation, the essay continues, is the decisive variable. It celebrates the rise in intensity of research and development— 3.6 trillion yuan (about $500 billion) in 2024, approaching Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development levels—and the growing integration of research with industrial application. The essay points to an “ engineer dividend ,” referring to China’s 5 million-strong annual cohort of STEM graduates, and encapsulates the leadership’s belief that human capital, organized at scale, constitutes a national endowment. This is a clear vision of creativity institutionalized through coordination rather than spontaneity. Its virtues are evident: speed, alignment, and security. What goes unspoken is the cost: diminished space for bottom-up experimentation and decentralized risk-taking. That omission is consequential. The lack of grassroots initiative has become increasingly visible in the very economic headwinds the leadership now acknowledges. Local bureaucracies, under acute fiscal pressure, have in many cases turned to predatory fee collection and arbitrary enforcement to fill budget gaps, placing heavy strain on the private and entrepreneurial sector. For many start-ups and small private firms, the combination of a weak macro environment and regulatory overreach has created an atmosphere of caution. The state’s “security first” lens—applied to data governance, cross-border information flows, and even academic collaboration—has compounded this, dampening venture capital activity and accelerating the flight of private equity. The challenge for China’s innovation drive is not technological capability but institutional elasticity: whether a system designed for control can also nurture the kind of uncertainty, long-term experimentation, and tolerance for failure that global technological leadership ultimately requires. This tension extends into the domain of consumption and social investment, where the essays’ confidence gives way to ambiguity. The analysis correctly diagnoses weak household confidence, rather than insufficient liquidity, as the principal obstacle to sustained demand. The proposed remedy aligns with long-standing prescriptions: strengthen the social safety net to reduce precautionary savings and stimulate consumption indirectly. The text calls for greater investment in child care, elder care, health care, and education—fields where the gap between need and provision remains wide—but offers few clues as to how these ambitions can be realized. Local governments remain fiscally constrained; household incomes are stagnant; private employers remain cautious; and, as analysts note, a “ massive crisis of confidence ” has left private firms reluctant to invest or hire, with the business community continuing to greet official reassurances about private sector support with skepticism. One of the more telling signals in the Zhong Caiwen series lies in its semantic shift from the earlier emphasis on “boosting” demand to a focus on expansion and upgrading. The change reflects recognition that earlier tools such as subsidies and trade-in programs have largely run their course. These policies, designed to encourage households to replace older cars, appliances, and electronics with new purchases, have produced short-term spikes in durable-goods consumption but limited lasting momentum. Their effect is likely to weaken in the second half of the year, because of both a high base effect and diminishing marginal returns, as muted job and income gains prevent a full rebound in consumption. With the limits of traditional stimulus increasingly apparent, the discussion now turns toward service-led consumption, particularly in sectors such as culture, commerce, sports, and tourism, where local governments are experimenting with new initiatives to stimulate activity. This area may hold the greatest political space for the local experimentation that has largely been limited during a Xi era defined by top-down projects, allowing officials to pursue visible, low-risk projects that align with national priorities while addressing local economic pressures. Still, the near-term effect is likely limited, as supply side buildup in service infrastructure, labor capacity, and institutional support will need to precede any significant demand recovery. This approach nonetheless signals an important philosophical shift at the level of political will. Instead of viewing redistribution as a constraint on growth, the state now portrays it as a new source of momentum—particularly in service sectors tied to improving people’s livelihoods. Health care, elder care, education, and child care are all portrayed as areas rich with market and employment potential. The Oct. 3 article notes, for instance, that with more than 300 million citizens over the age of 60, the country faces critical shortages of nursing home beds, doctors, and nurses. Addressing these “urgent livelihood concerns,” from child care and schooling to elder care and health services, could generate millions of new jobs and open vast domestic markets. Still, political intent is not synonymous with policy execution. If anything, the next set of priorities makes clear that infrastructure remains the state’s preferred lever for stabilizing growth. The goal, as stated, is to merge physical investment in areas such as rail and highways with technological upgrading such as smart-city systems, using infrastructure as both an economic stabilizer and a channel to diffuse growth into China’s less developed central and western regions. Urbanization policy follows the same logic. With the national urbanization rate plateauing , emphasis has shifted from expansion to urban quality: renovating old neighborhoods, upgrading public utilities, improving flood control, and modernizing public transit. This reframing optimistically turns the real estate downturn into an opportunity for transformation. Yet this engineering logic cannot fully dispel the deeper malaise confronting the economy—the interlocking gloom among local governments, private firms, and households. The problem is not cyclical, a residue of the COVID-19 pandemic or property slump, but structural. Years of reliance on selling land to raise funds have left localities fiscally depleted, constraining their capacity for social spending. The private sector, despite rhetorical assurances , still faces regulatory ambiguity and has a waning appetite for risk, while households remain wary amid demographic headwinds and eroding confidence in future income growth. The essays’ final section acknowledges the demographic challenge but reframes it as opportunity. Rising demand for health care, elder care, and education, it argues, can serve as a new engine of inclusive growth. By expanding these sectors, the state aims to transform demographic pressure into what officials term “new quality productive forces.” The potential of a more robust “care economy” capable of absorbing labor, fostering service sector innovation, and supporting domestic consumption is real. Yet what remains unresolved and unaddressed in Zhong Caiwen’s technocratic optimism is the central dilemma confronting China’s transition. The country’s past success was built on the very mechanisms—state coordination, administrative mobilization, and policy discipline—that now risk constraining its next stage of growth. The Zhong Caiwen essays are right to underscore resilience, but genuine resilience entails adaptation, not just central control. It requires tolerating uncertainty, distributing authority, and rebuilding trust among the state, the market, and society. The road ahead will involve painful trade-offs, between growth and redistribution, central direction and local autonomy, short-term certainty and long-term dynamism. Whether China can navigate these trade-offs will determine not only the trajectory of its modernization but also whether its model can continue to renew itself.",https://foreignpolicy.com/2025/10/14/china-peoples-daily-editorials-zhong-caiwen,Opinion,BBC,"Lizzi C.

b480a4da3d55,How to Understand MAGA and America’s New Right,,"Conventional wisdom suggests that young people are usually progressive but become more conservative as they age. But numerous polls show that in the United States, at least, the youngest voters are trending more conservative than before: Forty-three percent of Americans under 30 voted for Donald Trump in 2024, a 7 percentage-point jump from his previous two runs for the presidency. Are young Americans shifting rightward? And if so, why? Does the shift fit into traditional definitions of conservatism, or is it connected to culture war issues? And what does it all mean for Trump and the future of his MAGA movement? On the latest episode of FP Live, I spoke with conservative commentator Emily Jashinsky, who hosts the podcast After Party with Emily Jashinsky and is the D.C. correspondent for the website UnHerd. The full conversation is available on the video box atop this page, or on the FP Live podcast. What follows here is a lightly edited and condensed transcript. Ravi Agrawal: So, you describe yourself as a conservative who is also a journalist. There’s a trend today for journalists to identify their political affiliations, which in my mind runs counter to traditions that prioritize objectivity. What’s behind the trend? Emily Jashinsky: We’ve seen this happen over the course of decades, especially on the right. The conservative movement once sought to train young journalists who could go populate the newsrooms of legacy institutions, be secretly conservative and balance the media that way. But that changed as technology democratized the media space, especially when blogs erupted during the aughts. And it really shifted toward putting people who have open conservative voices into the media. That has advantages and disadvantages, of course. But it’s almost inevitably where the media is going because of how news-delivery systems are changing. Part of it has also been exasperation that it was almost impossible for conservatives to find themselves in these newsrooms anyway. RA: The right is not a monolith. There’s a diverse coalition of conservatives in America right now. So, what is the new right? EJ: This is the big question, of course. My litmus test for what’s “new right” versus “old right” today is if you are fundamentally sympathetic to the MAGA cause, if not Trump himself. It’s very hard to categorize people because right now there are a lot of insincere MAGA folks who are saying they love tariffs, for example, but they don’t actually love tariffs. They just love Donald Trump. But they’re old-right figures who don’t like the tariff regime; they don’t like industrial policy; they don’t like the anti-imperialist, anti-adventurist changes to foreign policy that [Vice President] J.D. Vance would advocate for. So that line is still there, but it’s covered up by the Trump of it all. Those lines within the conservative movement will be much more exposed after Trump. RA: OK, and given that backdrop, is it true that young Americans are trending conservative right now? And if so, why? EJ: It’s a great question. It’s true that young Americans are trending conservative. These trends tend to be more acute with young men. Sometimes these numbers are dragged in the conservative direction by the movement of young men even while young women are being nudged in the opposite direction. Because the shift among young men has been so dramatic. Now, it’s extremely complicated. There are all kinds of complications with using votes for Donald Trump as a proxy for being dragged right, but if you do that, young women moved too away from Dems. That’s a really interesting trend. I don’t know if it’s just because of [former Vice President] Kamala Harris or just because of Donald Trump. But there are shifts on big cultural questions. Immigration is a good example. A poll in September found 45 percent of young men support Trump’s immigration enforcement policies, and about 21 percent of young women. Neither is over the 50 percent line. But it is unusual for conservatives to find themselves with any level of support among younger Americans that approaches the 50 percent level. RA: One of the murky aspects of, say, immigration, is the big gap between Trump’s rhetoric and execution. And so, for example, for all the talk of mass deportations, we’re nowhere near the millions of people they wanted to deport. Instead, it seems to me that the point of the rhetoric is to put up a giant “Do not come here” sign, especially on the southern border. So it’s unclear to me whether younger Americans adhere to the rhetoric or to the policies. EJ: I think that’s true of the public more broadly. It’s just really hard to know, especially with Trump, because so much of his policy is intentionally about the performance. In the case of immigration, a lot of this is intended as a disincentive. And a lot of it is also trying to nudge the Overton window so Republican rhetoric on immigration is completely intolerant of Gang of Eight-style, old-right politics, where [then-Sen.] Marco Rubio infamously joined up with Democratic senators to pass what the Tea Party base at the time said was an absolutely intolerable comprehensive immigration reform bill. So it’s a little bit of both. We’ve seen recently Zach Bryan, a country singer popular especially with younger men, sing about [Immigration and Customs Enforcement] ICE busting down doors, that ICE is acting like authoritarian thugs. And Joe Rogan has expressed discomfort with Trump’s immigration enforcement policies. These are interesting cultural signifiers for future attitudes. RA: I didn’t expect to bring this up, but Taylor Swift has a new album out. Do you detect a move toward the right there as well? EJ: This is actually a great example. It looks like a move toward the right, but it’s not necessarily right-coded. She embraces marriage and the white-picket-fence American dream vision. She talks about wanting a block full of kids who look like her and a basketball hoop in her driveway. She really criticizes the decadence of Hollywood people who have dogs instead of children. This is only a year after she endorsed Kamala Harris by holding up her cat in an Instagram post as a nod to the Vance “childless cat ladies” line. And so it does seem like Taylor Swift has been swept up in the vibe shift among younger Americans. At the same time, though, it would be a mistake for the right to claim Taylor Swift as a conservative victory because I don’t think there’s any evidence that her politics have shifted to the right. Maybe she’s had a cultural lifestyle change over the last year, but there’s definitely a distinction. RA: I’m going to take us back to 30,000 feet. Why are younger people becoming attracted to the right? Is it just a broader sense that the system itself wasn’t working? Is it a backlash? EJ: It’s totally a backlash. And this is difficult for conservatives who interpret some of this as pro-right when it’s mostly anti-left. Charlie Kirk’s a good example. We were both in the conservative youth movement at the same time. And he believed that these cultural issues were dragging the right down. By the time he was killed, Charlie was almost exclusively talking about cultural issues, not about tax rates and the proper scope of government intervention in health care. He was almost explicitly talking about marriage, children, religion, abortion, immigration. Turning Point USA at one point had a culture war tour. A lot of that started around COVID. In my experience talking to young men, some of their earliest political memories are the MeToo movement and cancel culture, and all of this exploded when COVID hit. That was a paradigm-shifting experience, completely formative for all young people across the board. We never quite reckoned with that, and it surprised a lot of people when it showed up in support for Trump in 2024. But I don’t know if that is durable support for the Republican Party. RA: You’re essentially saying that the ascendancy of the new right is about being anti-left. The Democrats have also struggled in recent years with articulating a strategy that is anything “not Trump.” So the two sides are essentially just saying “not the other.” But what does the right stand for? EJ: This is the challenge for the right in the Trump era. Look at how Trump approached the question of TikTok before he became president again, when he had donors like Jeffrey Yass coming to him and saying, “You should save TikTok.” This is just one example of many where what Trump stands for is charitably called pragmatism. That means that people on the right scramble to either get themselves from point A to point B because their politics are now becoming pragmatic like Donald Trump’s, or to go back to basics and figure out what they actually believe is: Is Trump right or wrong on this? Because so much signaling comes down from Donald Trump to people on the right, I genuinely don’t know where some people will go when Trump is no longer there. It’s amazing how those shifts are just papered over because people will say “I just support Trump, I trust Trump,” and then nobody has to kind of duke it out because Trump had the final say-so. RA: You said a lot of the growth of conservative media was to balance a perceived kind of imbalance in the media ecosystem. How does the right grapple with elements of their leadership that they might disagree with? EJ: I love this question, and it’s actually one of the reasons that I’m in journalism. When you spend time in activist circles, and you’re more interested in the real story than wins and losses, it’s really hard to just work in the nonprofit world. A lot of people who find themselves in influencer spaces—we see it on the left, too—don’t really get that balance right. That’s to their detriment, actually, because their audiences want to trust them and want to believe what they’re saying is not paid propaganda. Even if you’re an influencer who has some media platform but isn’t technically a journalist, you’re still in trouble because nobody is more sensitive than Donald Trump himself about these loyalty litmus tests. I’ve literally been part of conversations where people wonder how on Earth conservatives are supposed to offer constructive criticism in the Trump era when there are so many tests to see if you’re with us or if you’re against us. That crystallized after the 2020 election, when these litmus tests became even more important for Donald Trump and the people around him. I do think that’s been a problem. Downstream of that we’ve seen less criticism, for example, on genuine free speech problems in the Trump administration from people on the right who staked their careers on free speech battles against the Obama and Biden administrations. That’s why it’s great to be in journalism, because you don’t have to worry about playing on a team. But a lot of people who step into these new media spaces still feel like they’re part of a team, and that makes it really hard for them to have honest conversations. RA: At times, it’s hard to distinguish between the “new left” and the “new right.” Both draw on populism. Both draw on a narrative that the system isn’t working, that many of the forces of the last four decades—globalization, urbanization, technological shifts—have gone too far, and that you need radical, dramatic change. So: “If that was a backlash, then we need a new backlash to the backlash.” I hear that both from the Bernie Sanders left and from the MAGA right. In your reporting, have you seen a cognizance on the right that a lot of what they say can often make them sound like the left? EJ: Yes. Some people who are united under the banner of Trumpism are really uncomfortable with some of the young Trumpism that has come into the mix. Israel is the best example of this. We’re sadly seeing this play out in public right now, but privately there is so much discomfort and really ugly tension on the right because young people on the right are so, so polarized from older people on the right about their beliefs about Israel. If we’re talking about a really hardened conservative ideologue versus a very hardened young liberal ideologue, there are obviously important differences. But when it comes to what U.S. involvement should be in that conflict, there are so many similarities. That makes people on the right extremely uncomfortable in private. Some of it is playing out publicly. But that battle has been really, really bitter internally for a couple of years now. RA: Let’s talk about foreign policy more broadly now. You’re absolutely right on Israel. There’s been a real shift in the American mood as well as in the Republican Party mood, especially among younger voters. It’s very telling that Marjorie Taylor Greene was the first Republican in Congress to call what’s happening in Gaza a genocide. She was an outlier initially, but people are rallying around her. What is the through line of what a Republican foreign policy is today? EJ: It’s the two simple words: America First. Everyone will agree with that in theory. RA: But what does that mean? EJ: Right. So does that mean colonizing Greenland, taking Canada, and then doing a sort of targeted regime-change operation in Venezuela, as seems to be on the table right now with the Trump administration? Nobody knows. Nobody has the answer because so many people take their cues as to what America First means from Donald Trump himself. I just saw this debate playing out on X with Dinesh D’Souza, who was saying Donald Trump defines what America First is, just how Donald Trump defined what MAGA is. Your interpretation of what is America First toward Israel or toward Venezuela is completely secondary to whatever Donald Trump thinks it is. What happens after Donald Trump leaves office? I genuinely don’t know. RA: But even before we get to when he leaves office, how do you as a conservative commentator feel about America First being the vague articulation of what one man thinks? Self-interest has always been the driver of foreign policy, so the idea that a country would place its self-interest first is not new at all. It’s a branding tool at some level. EJ: I know it’s absolutely a branding tool, and to that extent, it’s better than what came before. It is definitely an improvement, both politically and in substance, from everyone running against Donald Trump in the 2016 Republican primary. My perspective is that he has shifted the Overton window on foreign policy in a way that is much healthier, both for the right and for the country. On the other hand, Trump’s ideology is more pragmatic than it is political. He will define America First as the terms of any negotiation he is entering into. Greenland is a really good example of this. Is America First a sort of Monroe Doctrine, as some people have tried to cast it? Or is it smart adventurism? These questions are genuinely difficult to resolve because Donald Trump defines them bit by bit. At the same time, though, that pragmatism is an improvement over this template that gets applied to Iraq, Afghanistan, Iran, different places in Africa in the global war on terrorism moment. RA: I have a lot of sympathy for the argument that what happened before was not ideal, and I think that is a great debate to play out. On Trump himself, however, especially for viewers of this show, if you threaten to take over another country, those are red lines—it breaks international law. There are real, global consequences to pulling out of the Paris climate agreement, for example. You mentioned Dinesh D’Souza earlier, this articulation of what Trump thinks is the manifestation of American foreign policy today. How does that play into another big-ticket issue: growing fears of authoritarianism? Consolidation of power in the executive, federal troops in American cities, detentions of op-ed writers for criticizing Israel, investigating and firing political opponents. How does the right accommodate these things that, on the face, seem very problematic? EJ: I came of age during the Obama era, when the right was constantly criticizing the executive for abusing the concentration of executive power for political goals—DACA, for example. I actually think some of that is completely fair and helpful, but this is where it’s difficult with the Trump administration, because the president himself is a real raw-power politician. That manifests in ways that go beyond the conservative vision for the separation of powers. There are serious questions about civil liberties and free speech that are being raised right now by the way the Trump administration is prosecuting Trump’s domestic policy vision. And there’s very little pushback to it because people are afraid of failing that litmus test of loyalty. This might sound odd, but there are people who genuinely trust Trump’s instincts, because he’s proved them wrong in different ways. There are people who said conservatives had to moderate on immigration to ever win an election again—then Trump came in on a “build the wall” platform and trounced the Republican primary. So some of it is people genuinely deferring to Donald Trump, and a lot of it is people being afraid to fail the litmus test and push back on what would be seen otherwise as excesses of government power. RA: Connecting the dots globally, how does the rise of the American right fit into our dovetail with the rise of the right across the world? Think of strongmen in places like Turkey, Hungary, and India. How do you think about the connections between them? Is there a feedback loop? EJ: One of the reasons this is also interesting is the backlash in terms of whether this is an anti-left movement or a pro-right movement, and I do think that’s one of the through lines we see in Western populism, whether it’s AfD, Popular Front, Reform, or MAGA. It’s difficult to talk about all of this, partly because the coalition is so diverse in a way the old American conservative fusionist coalition under the anti-communist banner wasn’t. They were able to find common ground for so long that tied together neoconservatism, fiscal conservatism, and social conservatism, to the point where big conservative gatherings were held for decades. Now, part of what makes it difficult to even talk about this is that the right’s coalition is instinctive and reactionary, which is rooted in nationalism. If you look at Reform or France and Germany, it’s very similar to that. As you were pointing out, one of the important through lines here is having a huge chunk of your coalition being more anti-left than pro-right. The Trump coalition, for example, is not this massive Tea Party limited-government movement. That’s just not what the MAGA coalition is part of. That’s really similar, when you’re bringing in so many anti-left people to the coalition. What does that look like in Hungary, when [Prime Minister Viktor] Orban has to hang on to power? It’s a great question, and one that he is obviously confronting right now.",https://foreignpolicy.com/2025/10/14/jashinksy-maga-new-right,Opinion,BBC,Ravi Agrawal,https://foreignpolicy.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/GettyImages-2180971795_2573d3-e1760450451639.jpg?w=1000,2025-11-12T00:00:00,6c72e78be2723e4e0109a08aaadb25600db9a1c9
80ca2654920f,Tehran’s Dual Strategy for Surviving Snapback,,"On Aug. 28, France, Germany, and the United Kingdom triggered the U.N. snapback mechanism, leading to the reinstatement of pre-2015 sanctions against Iran last month. Despite Russian and Chinese efforts to stall the process, their draft proposal was rejected by a majority in the U.N. Security Council. With snapback restored, Iran once again faces much harsher restrictions on arms sales, bans on ballistic missile activity, asset freezes, and travel bans. For policymakers in Washington, Brussels, and Jerusalem, one question quickly arose: How will Tehran respond? The first answers may already be visible inside Iran. Days after the snapback took effect, the Guardian Council approved new laws stiffening punishments for espionage and collaboration with Israel or “hostile states” and restricting civilian drone use. Around the same time, the Fatehin special unit of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) conducted high-profile drills in Tehran, showcasing new uniforms and equipment. In a surprising move, the Expediency Council also conditionally approved Iran’s accession to the Convention for the Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism, after years of resistance. Officially, some council members argued that compliance would disrupt funding for regional allies such as Hezbollah, part of a broader attempt to counter Western narratives of the country as supporting terrorism.

Officially, some council members argued that compliance would disrupt funding for regional allies such as Hezbollah, part of a broader attempt to counter Western narratives of the country as supporting terrorism. These measures are not routine; they signal how the Islamic Republic intends to withstand renewed isolation by tightening internal security, projecting resilience abroad, reducing foreign pressure, and demonstrating to adversaries that sanctions will not break the regime. In this way, Iran will choose patience over provocation. Although Tehran tried to delay the snapback, many Iranian officials had long anticipated it. Domestically, they downplay its impact, insisting that Iran’s economy can endure. IRGC-linked media frame the sanctions not as an existential threat but as a Western psychological operation designed to weaken public confidence and fuel political polarization. This is a familiar narrative, portraying sanctions as part of a broader regime-change strategy. Yet following the decision, Tehran has taken only limited steps: recalling ambassadors from several European capitals, denouncing the move as “illegitimate,” and issuing vague warnings about reducing cooperation with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). Concrete escalation has not followed. Some voices in Tehran have urged more drastic measures, including withdrawal from the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT). Leaving the NPT would free Iran from inspections and, in theory, allow the open pursuit of nuclear weapons. Yet the supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, and senior elites have consistently resisted this option, emphasizing that Iran will remain in the treaty, even if it brings little benefit. Withdrawal, they recognize, would almost certainly provoke Israeli strikes, invite U.S. intervention, and push Saudi Arabia and Turkey to develop their own nuclear programs. In Tehran’s calculus, such risks would escalate tensions, legitimize foreign military intervention, and ultimately jeopardize the regime’s survival. Tehran is also acutely aware of its limited capabilities and lack of viable options for escalation. Most of Iran’s proxy groups have been severely weakened since Oct. 7, 2023, and by the collapse of the Assad regime. Only the Houthis in Yemen and a handful of Shiite militias in Iraq retain the ability to harass U.S. and Israeli interests, and even their reach is limited. On paper, Tehran could still resort to cyberattacks, disruptions to shipping in the Persian Gulf, or limited drone and missile strikes against Israel and U.S. bases. Yet all these carry serious risks. Israel has demonstrated its willingness to strike inside Iran, while Washington has vowed to retaliate forcefully against any attacks on U.S. personnel. The cost of escalation weighs heavily on Iranian decision-makers. They still recall the lessons of war with Israel, which inflicted devastating damage on Iran’s nuclear and missile programs and eliminated much of its senior military leadership. For this reason, Tehran is more likely to downplay the snapback sanctions while resorting to incremental, familiar tactics that increase leverage without crossing the nuclear threshold, such as advancing enrichment, deploying faster centrifuges, and restricting IAEA access. These steps bolster bargaining power while avoiding a direct confrontation that could legitimize military intervention. Sanctions, while painful, are not new. The Islamic Republic has developed ways to live with them. Oil sales to China, extensive smuggling networks, and a tightly managed domestic economy provide enough oxygen for survival. For a regime that has endured economic warfare for most of its 45-year existence, sanctions remain a grim constant. At the political level, Iran is divided. Hard-liners call for bold defiance, but pragmatists urge caution. In moments of existential pressure, Khamenei has consistently sided with restraint. During the Trump administration’s “maximum pressure” campaign, Tehran endured sanctions without quitting the NPT or launching a full-scale war. The same logic is likely to prevail now. Precedent reinforces this path. Time and again, Tehran has chosen to endure pressure rather than risk escalation that could endanger the regime’s survival. In other words, Iran’s leaders are unlikely to seek a dramatic escalation and will instead opt for restraint, which they refer to as “ strategic patience .” Timing also favors this approach. With Israeli parliamentary elections a year away, Tehran calculates that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu could lose power. And beyond Israel, Tehran hopes that a Democrat could win the 2028 U.S. presidential election, potentially altering Washington’s stance toward Iran. In this scenario, Iran’s leaders need only endure for a maximum of three years, relying on what they call “ divine miraculous and unseen assistance .” For Khamenei, however, the snapback is not merely a foreign-policy crisis but also a domestic one. Despite his rhetoric, he recognizes that the gravest threats originate from within, rather than from abroad. These include elite fragmentation and widespread unrest, both of which intensify when the regime is under pressure. His strategy, therefore, is twofold: preserve unity among the ruling elite at the top while managing social pressures through a mix of controlled concessions and intensified repression against opposition below. Elite cohesion has always been the regime’s key survival mechanism. Divisions among Revolutionary Guard commanders, clerics, or political elites would embolden adversaries and destabilize the system. This is why Khamenei avoids risky moves, such as withdrawing from the NPT, that could fracture the elite. Instead, he stresses unity, framing resistance as both a revolutionary duty and a matter of national honor. His strategy combines rewards for loyal elites with calibrated violence to deter defection. In this way, Khamenei seeks to bind his own fate to that of the regime’s elites, ensuring that their survival is inseparable from his own. At the same time, Khamenei will attempt to maintain Iran’s silence. Sanctions have already driven up food prices and devalued the currency against the dollar, heightening public discontent. To alleviate social pressure, the regime has adjusted its approach to morality policing, which was once a central ideological pillar. According to interviews with police personnel and active Basij members, they have been instructed not to interfere in enforcing the Islamic dress code. The aim is to avoid provoking public anger and prevent a repeat of incidents like the arrest and death of Mahsa Amini, which sparked nationwide protests . Anything that risks triggering mass unrest is to be carefully avoided. The regime is simultaneously intensifying repression against parts of society, even though such measures risk sparking protests or destabilizing the system. Leaders understand that renewed sanctions will worsen economic hardship, driving inflation and unemployment higher. The memory of the 2019 fuel protests, when security forces killed some 1,500 people in less than a week, still haunts the state. To preempt a repeat, the government has begun flexing its muscles: staging street patrols by Basij and IRGC units, expanding surveillance, criminalizing dissent as “espionage,” and invoking new security laws , recently approved by the Guardian Council, to legitimize harsher crackdowns. The IRGC’s Fatehin drills were not merely a tactical exercise; they were also a warning to Iranians that the state is watching and prepared to use force. Additionally, according to a report by an opposition group, Iran’s Supreme National Security Council has issued a security directive outlining the government’s plan for responding to potential unrest in the event of increased international sanctions. The directive encompasses both security measures, such as deployment, surveillance, and suppression, and propaganda and social resilience strategies, including media efforts and economic messaging. This dual strategy, characterized by unity at the top and repression below, is designed to buy time. Khamenei expects three difficult years ahead, but his bet is simple. If the regime can maintain internal stability and suppress dissent, it can endure external pressure until the geopolitical context changes. The snapback mechanism delivers a major diplomatic defeat and deepens Iran’s economic woes. Yet Tehran is unlikely to respond with a dramatic escalation, in the hope of surviving the next three years of the Trump administration. Instead, it is more likely to fall back on its oldest survival strategy: patience. The Islamic Republic will securitize its domestic sphere, showcase military defiance, and wait for the U.S. election, hoping for a new and more compromising president in the White House. For Khamenei, now frail but still in command, restraint is not weakness but necessity. He prefers to exit history as the symbol of steadfast defiance and an anti-American hero rather than a defeated and humiliated leader who accepts “ unconditional surrender .” For the outside world, the paradox is clear. While sanctions make Iran appear cornered, in Tehran’s view, unity, repression, and patience are enough to keep the Islamic Republic afloat during the storm. From this perspective, endurance itself is a form of victory.",https://foreignpolicy.com/2025/10/14/iran-snapback-sanctions-strategy,Opinion,BBC,Saeid Golkar,https://foreignpolicy.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/tehran-snapback-GettyImages-2231892374.jpg?w=1000,2025-11-12T00:00:00,6f7be881642384f35a0d2b91a8ae7c13f51dd483
9c8e7d142f9f,Trump Takes a Victory Lap in Israel,,"U.S. President Donald Trump landed in Israel on Monday to a rapturous welcome, from banners on the beach near Tel Aviv to a standing ovation in the Israeli parliament, the Knesset, where his personal and pivotal role in bringing home the last 20 surviving Israeli hostages was thanked, effusively, by families, service members, and many—though not all—Israeli politicians. Trump’s lightning trip to Israel started with a meeting with families of former hostages in Jerusalem. Hamas released all 20 of the remaining living captives early Monday, just before Israel released nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners and detainees. The exchange was part of what is currently a cease-fire but which Trump hopes will be the first step in a comprehensive peace deal that sorts out the Gaza Strip’s future and disarms Hamas. U.S. President Donald Trump landed in Israel on Monday to a rapturous welcome, from banners on the beach near Tel Aviv to a standing ovation in the Israeli parliament, the Knesset, where his personal and pivotal role in bringing home the last 20 surviving Israeli hostages was thanked, effusively, by families, service members, and many—though not all—Israeli politicians. Trump’s lightning trip to Israel started with a meeting with families of former hostages in Jerusalem. Hamas released all 20 of the remaining living captives early Monday, just before Israel released nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners and detainees. The exchange was part of what is currently a cease-fire but which Trump hopes will be the first step in a comprehensive peace deal that sorts out the Gaza Strip’s future and disarms Hamas. For starters came a valedictory, and a well-deserved one, as the cease-fire is in place, the hostages are home, and the cheers from Khan Younis, in the devastated Gaza Strip, to Tel Aviv echoed in unison. What was also in unison were the messages that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Trump delivered to the Knesset. After Hamas’s attack on Oct. 7, 2023, “Israel did what it had to do,” Netanyahu declared on Monday—a tidy summation of a two-year war that leveled most of Gaza, led hundreds of thousands of people to flee, and killed, by official estimates, at least 67,000 Palestinians. Trump used the same words in describing his peace credentials and the power of the U.S. military: “We have to do what we have to do.” Trump went on: “America joins you in those two everlasting vows: Never forget, and never again.” Trump made it clear that he expects Netanyahu to stick to this cease-fire. While flying to Israel, he told reporters on Air Force One that the “war is over.” Even though Israeli forces will only make a partial withdrawal from the Gaza Strip as part of Trump’s peace plan, renewed hostilities at this point would be a direct slap in the face of a president whom Netanyahu described as “the greatest friend that the state of Israel has ever had in the White House.” The solemnity and historic nature of the day, whether at the Re’im military base where the hostages were first ushered home via the care of the International Red Cross or the red-carpet treatment that Trump received at Ben Gurion Airport, are indelible. What was also indelible was the bellicose nature of Netanyahu’s remarks to the Knesset, in which he described a battle between civilization and barbarity; Trump later called his interlocutors in negotiations “monsters.” Trump, in a typically rambling speech, praised his negotiating team, including Steve Witkoff, as well as Gen. Dan Cain, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, but he also found time to wade wildly into Israeli politics. He asked Israeli President Isaac Herzog to pardon Netanyahu, who is under indictment for various counts of corruption and malfeasance and whose government may not last until the scheduled elections next fall. Not everyone in the audience was pleased by Trump’s presence, though. As the U.S. president spoke, two Knesset members —Ayman Odeh, an Arab Israeli politician and head of the left-wing Hadash party, and Ofer Cassif, a party member—shouted protests and held up signs that read “Recognize Palestine” before being swiftly removed by security. The theatrics of Trump’s Israel visit aside, the heavy lifting will begin later Monday at a summit in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt, which Trump will attend along with more than 20 world leaders, including Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas; Netanyahu, however, will not be there . Nor will Iran’s leaders , who were invited by Egypt. On the agenda are the very pressing questions about this peace deal: how to disarm Hamas, as the militant group has already started retaking control of areas vacated by the departing Israeli army; how to cobble together a workable governance structure for the Gaza Strip that is designed to exclude the only formation that ever won an election there; and how to begin the arduous, and expensive, process of rebuilding a place that is mostly rubble and ruin. But, for now, Trump has his victory lap. As Netanyahu said while nominating Trump for Israel’s top honor, the Israel Prize, he may not have won “the other one”—a reference to the Nobel Peace Prize—but that day may come. Perhaps.

239a5ef85388,Three Reckonings the Gaza Deal Will Force,,"Israelis woke last Thursday to the news that many of them had been fervently hoping to hear for two years: The Israeli government and Hamas had agreed to a deal to return all Israeli hostages and end the Gaza war. If the deal holds , it will bring a much-needed end to the violent conflict that begin on Oct. 7, 2023. But it will also force three reckonings for Israelis that will shape the country’s future in more lasting ways. Israelis woke last Thursday to the news that many of them had been fervently hoping to hear for two years: The Israeli government and Hamas had agreed to a deal to return all Israeli hostages and end the Gaza war. If the deal holds , it will bring a much-needed end to the violent conflict that begin on Oct. 7, 2023. But it will also force three reckonings for Israelis that will shape the country’s future in more lasting ways. The first is a reckoning between Israelis and their leaders. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s government had been in power for more than nine months when Hamas launched its assault. And despite the departure of key military and intelligence figures, that same government has remained in power, overseeing Israel’s actions in Gaza, the West Bank, Iran, Lebanon, Syria, and Yemen. Netanyahu and his government are historically unpopular , and most Israelis at least partially blame them for failing to prevent Oct. 7. But Netanyahu has consistently argued that no accountability, assignment of blame, or even elections are appropriate while Israeli hostages remain in Gaza and the war continues. So far, his argument has worked. Despite feeling that their government has abandoned them, Israelis who turned out by the hundreds of thousands before Oct. 7 to protest Netanyahu’s judicial overhaul and those who turned out after Oct. 7 to show solidarity with the hostages and their families have still been reluctant to adopt an overtly political agenda. That will now come to an end. Israelis will likely demand that this government resign, and Netanyahu will have a hard time keeping his far-right coalition members from bolting over a deal that they view as a capitulation to Hamas. The coming elections will be the most consequential in Israel’s history, ushering in a government that not only will have to manage the fallout from Gaza and help Israelis heal from their physical and emotional scars but will have to rebuild the basic compact between citizens and their government. The Netanyahu government ignored Israelis’ preferences on the hostages and the war and also fell short on its basic response to the Oct. 7 attack. This forced Israeli civil society to step into the breach to rebuild communities, secure bomb shelters, provide emergency assistance, and organize a civilian diplomatic effort on behalf of the hostage families. The next government will have to demonstrate that it can perform basic functions while also managing the next phase in Gaza and fixing Israel’s deteriorated relations with European and Arab states. On top of all this, it will also have to fend off constant mendacious attacks from the Israeli right that it is capitulating to terrorists and midwifing a hostile Palestinian state in Israelis’ midst. This would be a daunting burden in the best of circumstances, all the more so for a coalition that is likely to span a wide ideological gamut and disagree on some of the thorniest issues related to the Palestinians. The second reckoning is over Israeli attitudes toward Palestinians. Some 1,200 Israelis were killed and more than 250 abducted on Oct. 7, but all Israelis personally felt the impact. The lesson that most took away was that there could be no lasting peace with Palestinians and there was no way to build a Palestinian state that could peacefully co-exist with Israel. As a result, Israeli attitudes toward Palestinians are at their nadir, driven by unprecedented hostility. Yet U.S. President Donald Trump’s 20-point plan calls for Israel to engage with Palestinians in multiple ways, not only in working together on postwar Gaza but on developing a “credible pathway to Palestinian self-determination and statehood.” It also commits the United States to convene talks between Israelis and Palestinians on a political horizon for peace—in other words, a renewed Israeli-Palestinian peace process. These are difficult things for Israelis to swallow. Now, Israel will have to embark on a new phase in its relationship with the Palestinians under a cloud of mistrust, suspicion, and anger. There will be a new Palestinian administration in Gaza, there is the existing Palestinian Authority in the West Bank, and there are millions of Palestinians who remain under some measure of Israeli control and want to resume their lives, requiring daily interaction with Israelis and their government. Israelis must figure out what their post-Oct. 7 relationship with all of these entities will be now that that period is set to begin. Is Israel going to maintain the Netanyahu framework of claiming no real distinction between Hamas and the PA, or will it restore the working relationship that it had with the PA only a few years ago? Will West Bank annexation remain a constant threat just over the horizon, or will the pressure from Arab governments and European states that now recognize Palestine force a shift? If Israel yields to the pressure and offers any sort of political horizon for Palestinian statehood, many Israelis will view it as a reward for Oct. 7, creating enormous domestic political opposition. Alternatively, if Israel categorically rules out working with any Palestinian entity and continues to discuss Palestinian statehood in apocalyptic terms while also deepening the dispossession of Palestinians in the West Bank, it will make the international landscape increasingly hostile. The result will be more state arms embargos, more businesses barred from trade shows, and more Israeli tourists harassed and even attacked while traveling overseas. This will lead directly to the autarkic economy that Netanyahu recently spoke of . The third reckoning is between Israel and the United States. The Gaza war has brought a seismic shift in Americans’ relationship to Israel. Polls show a majority of U.S. voters now oppose military support for Israel, while a plurality sympathize more with Palestinians than Israelis and believe that Israel intentionally kills civilians. Among Democrats, it has become increasingly mainstream to advocate restrictions on security assistance to Israel. And the most influential voices in the MAGA-verse—from Tucker Carlson to Steve Bannon to Candace Owens—speak about Israel in dark terms as a drain on U.S. resources. There is little question that the U.S.-Israel relationship is going to change. The only question is how much. While the Gaza war was going on, it was easy to dismiss Israel’s faltering status as a short-term dip driven by the daily news images and to argue that everything would go back to the status quo ante with the war’s end. Now that the war is over, Israelis are likely to discover that the opinions developed by many Americans over the past two years will not easily dissipate. Israelis will have to develop new ways to explain their country to Americans, new arguments for why Israel is an important and worthy ally, and new strategies for operating in a world where U.S. support is not necessarily as fulsome or automatic. Israel may be able to win over some of the skeptics on the question of Israel’s strategic value. This will be particularly true if improved relationships between Israel and its neighbors allow the United States to reduce its presence in the Middle East and if Israel is seen, as with Russia during the Cold War, as a critical bulwark against China. It will be harder to convince skeptics about Israel’s democratic values and participation in the rules-based order amid genocide accusations, International Criminal Court indictments of Israeli leaders, and the ongoing effort of the Israeli right to pursue annexation and transfer in the West Bank. If Israeli leaders rely on the old saws about Israel being the only democracy in the Middle East or the Israel Defense Forces being the most moral army in the world without making a genuine shift in policy, they will only compound the problems that the country is already facing. Israelis will spend the coming days and weeks consumed with the return of hostages from brutal captivity and mourning the loss of those who do not return alive. But they will quickly have to turn to the new challenges on the horizon and steer their country in new directions to deal with the massive currents that Oct. 7 has brought.",https://foreignpolicy.com/2025/10/13/israel-gaza-trump-hamas-peace-democracy-ceasefire,Opinion,BBC,Michael J.

79e358e1d269,Brazil’s Invisible Communities Deserve to Be Counted,,"The rise in big data and artificial intelligence has weaponized, excluded, disadvantaged, and exacerbated the inequities faced by oppressed communities. In the United States, President Donald Trump’s repeated attempts to exclude immigrants from census data—plus the gerrymandering that has increasingly distorted district representation—show that the way the population is counted matters. Yet if data were calculated and reported with integrity, then people could actually be seen, with all their needs and rights recognized. In Brazil, one of the largest populations of uncounted people are the more than 5,900 Quilombola communities across the country. Quilombolas are descendants of Africans who escaped enslavement, established communities (often rural), and self-declared themselves as having a distinct ethnic identity from the rest of Brazilian society. Quilombola communities span countries such as Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador , Suriname, Honduras , Belize, and Nicaragua , and they have often been guaranteed specific territorial rights to protect their shared ancestry, social fabric, and existence.

Quilombola communities span countries such as Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador , Suriname, Honduras , Belize, and Nicaragua , and they have often been guaranteed specific territorial rights to protect their shared ancestry, social fabric, and existence. A new study , published in the journal World Development Sustainability in June, found a vast lack of data on Quilombola lands and people. The study highlighted the finding that of the more than 5,900 Quilombola communities in Brazil, only 494 are named and acknowledged through public records. For the rigorous analysis of multiple stages of gaining land rights in this study, sufficient data was available for just 313 of these. Thousands of Quilombola communities remain invisible. What this means is that these communities aren’t counted in any public data analysis; many don’t show up on Google Maps; and, importantly, many don’t have legal documentation proving where their territories start and end. This ambiguity creates much room for land conflicts and means that there is no clear way for Quilombolas to defend their lands once these conflicts begin. This adds to a big list of existing challenges for Quilombolas, who already face poverty rates twice that of white Brazilians and who often lack access to basic sanitation, waste disposal, and even water. On top of all of this, facing persistent and disproportionate acts of racism and violence does not make life easy. Without direct evidence that Quilombolas exist, it is easy to ignore these communities, including their rights, their dreams, and their demands. Insecure rights make it easy for land speculators to contest residents’ rights to their land—an urgent problem given that studies have estimated that more than 98 percent of Quilombola territories are threatened with encroachment and violence by mining, large-scale agricultural plantations, infrastructure development, overlapping private properties, and land grabs. Plus, a lack of political representation makes it difficult for Quilombola needs and demands to gain political attention. Land conflicts also have global implications for climate change. Many Quilombola territories contain large proportions of rich tropical forest—with more than 3.4 million hectares of native vegetation—comprising habitats that could be destroyed if corporations and private owners gain claims to this land. Trying to determine the role that these forests play is very difficult; how can researchers know if their sample is representative when roughly 90 percent of this data is missing? The study published in World Development Sustainability highlights that only 3 percent (or less) of Quilombola territories in Brazil have formalized land tenure rights. This is a drastic underrepresentation compared to the 67 percent of Indigenous territories with formalized land rights in the country—even though both populations are guaranteed land rights in the 1988 Brazilian Constitution . A lack of data does not only translate to a lack of rights to land, but also a lack of access to public policies guaranteeing basic rights such as health care, education, sanitation, and agricultural financing. Indigenous peoples in Brazil have been far more comprehensively represented by public statistics—a recognition and rights that Quilombola residents also deserve. Recognizing land rights and preventing invasions cannot happen without data—written proof that Quilombola territories and people exist. So why is there such a big data gap? There have been massive budget cuts and increased institutional barriers for Quilombola recognition, and some scholars and scholar-activists claim that these efforts have been intentional (see here , here , and here ). First, a severe defunding of INCRA—Brazil’s National Institute of Colonization and Agrarian Reform, the government body in charge of land tenure for Quilombola communities—has paralyzed Quilombolas’ abilities to obtain legal rights to land. In fact, funding designated for demarcating Quilombola lands decreased 89 percent between 2014 and 2019, and INCRA had budget reductions of 58 percent for these activities in 2019 alone. Second, powerful groups in Brazil (such as members of Brazil’s agribusiness caucus) with strong anti-Quilombola sentiments—often backed by overt or covert racism —have set up numerous institutional barriers, preventing Quilombola communities from gaining land rights by making it increasingly arduous to reach the end of the six-stage approval process. Data justice for Quilombola communities could be achieved by literally putting them on the map. Part of the project of land-grabbing and colonialism has involved intentionally claiming that lands are “empty” or “available” to negate the rights of those who have lived there for generations. Much of that data is potentially available—if we look in the right places. The Brazilian organization CONAQ (the National Coordination of Rural Black Quilombola Communities) and other civil society organizations have made substantial efforts to support Quilombola interests, including through data collection, organizing, and public protests. The 2022 Brazilian census also included Quilombolas for the first time in Brazilian history, since data on Quilombolas had never previously been collected in the census. However, the 494 officially recognized territories were not enough. More funding must be restored to INCRA, as well as increased support given to CONAQ and other related civil society organizations, to uphold constitutional and human rights. Data is power . With the next U.N. climate conference—COP30—coming up in Belém, Brazil, in November as well as an increasing need to find long-term effective climate solutions , guaranteeing data to Quilombola communities is a critical way to promote environmental and data justice. Data can hold powerful actors such as politicians, corporations, and speculators accountable to the Brazilian Constitution—and to legislation that already exists to provide historical reparations. Data can provide the evidence used in court cases, research, and public dialogue to protect the rights of Quilombolas. Data provides proof that Quilombolas exist, and Quilombolas—like other Brazilians—deserve no less.",https://foreignpolicy.com/2025/10/13/brazil-quilombola-afro-brazilians-slavery-data,Opinion,BBC,Rayna Benzeev,https://foreignpolicy.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/BRAZIL-DATA-QUILOMBOLAS-GettyImages-1230819173.png?w=1000,2025-10-17T00:00:00,7f445d02de73aa15ba0892961bab7febcc675971
c1b94764d42c,Trump Erases Women From Foreign Policy,,"When U.S. President Donald Trump returned to the White House in January, it was clear that the U.S. approach to women’s rights and gender equality around the world would shift. Republican administrations have long diverged from Democratic ones on this front, favoring women’s economic empowerment and private-sector development over broader campaigns to challenge traditional gender norms or expand reproductive rights. Yet rather than again steering U.S. global engagement on women’s rights in a more conservative direction, the second Trump administration has dismantled the bipartisan policy architecture that sustained those efforts. In doing so, the White House has overturned more than six decades of policy precedent, including from Trump’s first term. When U.S. President Donald Trump returned to the White House in January, it was clear that the U.S. approach to women’s rights and gender equality around the world would shift. Republican administrations have long diverged from Democratic ones on this front, favoring women’s economic empowerment and private-sector development over broader campaigns to challenge traditional gender norms or expand reproductive rights. Yet rather than again steering U.S. global engagement on women’s rights in a more conservative direction, the second Trump administration has dismantled the bipartisan policy architecture that sustained those efforts. In doing so, the White House has overturned more than six decades of policy precedent, including from Trump’s first term. The U.S. government has invested in women’s global socioeconomic empowerment for decades. In 1973, under President Richard Nixon, Congress first passed legislation mandating that foreign assistance pay “particular attention” to activities that integrate women into national economies. That clause, championed by Republican Sen. Charles H. Percy, prompted the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) to establish its first Women in Development Office in 1974. Republican and Democratic administrations have interpreted this mandate differently. Reproductive rights became a divisive issue early on: President Ronald Reagan introduced the Mexico City policy in 1984 , restricting U.S. foreign assistance to organizations that provide or advocate for abortion services. The policy has been instated by every Republican president and rescinded by every Democrat ever since. Still, leaders of both parties have historically recognized that it is in the economic and geopolitical interest of the United States to reduce poverty, fight infectious diseases, and prevent humanitarian emergencies around the world—and that doing so requires investing in women, who comprise about half of the global population. During Reagan’s first term, for instance, USAID released its “ Women in Development ” policy, warning that educational, health, legal, and institutional hurdles were holding back women’s economic potential worldwide. Building on this legacy, in 2019 Congress passed the bipartisan Women’s Entrepreneurship and Economic Empowerment Act . The first Trump administration launched the Women’s Global Development and Prosperity Initiative to support women’s economic participation worldwide. Upon taking office this year, Trump rapidly dismantled USAID and most of its programs. What remains of U.S. foreign aid focuses mostly on crisis relief and is now managed by the State Department. The administration’s budget request for fiscal year 2026 eliminates all bilateral funding for family planning and reproductive health as well as for maternal and child health, except for polio; its new global health strategy makes no reference to women. The Trump administration has also rolled back U.S. support for women’s political leadership, a once-bipartisan pillar of U.S. democracy assistance. Launched under Reagan in 1983, the National Endowment for Democracy (NED) and its affiliate institutes have worked alongside the State Department and USAID to support democratic institutions abroad. Over time, these efforts have expanded to include women’s political participation—not as a left-wing project, but as a bipartisan commitment to more inclusive and resilient governance. For instance, the International Republican Institute—a NED partner with senior GOP leaders among its founders and board of directors—has led the Women’s Democracy Network since 2006, offering training and support to women leaders worldwide. Although NED has so far managed to protect its congressional funding, the Trump administration is seeking to defund the organization and has slashed all other sources of international democracy support. Besides hollowing out foreign assistance, the Trump administration has dismantled the U.S. government’s infrastructure for integrating attention to gender equality and women into foreign policy. Trump’s July reorganization of the State Department eliminated the Office of Global Women’s Issues (GWI), as well as teams in other bureaus that once held portfolios related to women’s rights, such as the Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons and the Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor. The now-defunct GWI office built on a long-standing institutional commitment to women’s rights, both as a moral imperative and diplomatic tactic. Recognizing that women played a key role in winning hearts and minds during the Cold War, the State Department appointed a consultant on women’s activities as early as 1961. The Nixon and Ford administrations created an office of International Women’s Programs within the Bureau of International Organization Affairs in the 1970s, seeing women’s rights as a strategic way to enhance U.S. power on the multilateral stage. In the 1990s, Congress upped the ante. Following intense lobbying by feminist groups, the 1994 Foreign Relations Authorization Act mandated that the State Department designate a senior advisor on international women’s human rights . President Bill Clinton responded by setting up the Office of International Women’s Issues, which President George W. Bush continued to support. This office became the GWI when President Barack Obama elevated it to report directly to the secretary of state and created the position of ambassador-at-large for global women’s issues . Until the White House shut it down in the spring, the GWI had provided in-house guidance for the State Department across three presidential administrations, including during Trump’s first term. When asked about the consequences of closing the GWI office, Secretary of State Marco Rubio told Congress in May that women’s issues would be integrated into U.S. foreign policy through U.S. embassies and regional bureaus. But there are no more dedicated resources, staff, or guidance in place for the State Department to carry this out. When the State Department released its annual human rights reports in August, it did not include the standard sections on women’s rights that had been present since 1979, when the department under President Jimmy Carter told embassies that women’s rights “needs to be covered with greater specificity in all reports.” In 1994, the State Department expanded the scope of what constituted women’s rights to include violations such as domestic violence, employment discrimination, and human trafficking. Systematic data collection continued until this year. Perhaps the most surprising rollback was the April announcement via Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth’s X post that the Pentagon had “proudly ENDED the ‘Women, Peace & Security’ (WPS) program.” In 2011, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton spearheaded WPS as an interagency plan to ensure the greater inclusion of women in peace and security across the U.S. government. The move was based on a growing body of research showing that women experience conflict differently from men and that women’s participation improves peace processes and long-term stability . Hegseth called WPS a “Biden initiative,” arguing that “troops HATE it.” Both claims are demonstrably false. When the first Trump administration enshrined the WPS agenda into law with the 2017 Women, Peace, and Security Act, the Republican-controlled Congress touted it as a win. The act passed thanks in part to two legislators who are now cabinet members: Rubio was a Senate co-sponsor, while Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem introduced the act in the House . In 2019, Trump released a new WPS strategy that the White House said reaffirmed the United States’ “strong and unwavering commitment to advancing women’s equality.” Coupled with appropriations in the National Defense Authorization Act, the strategy (and that which followed it under President Joe Biden) pushed the Department of Defense to create gender advisor positions, develop training on the gender dimensions of conflict and crisis, bolster bilateral security cooperation through joint exercises and regional training academies on WPS, and introduce programs for civilian protection in conflict. Many champions of WPS came from the uniformed military , who recognized its operational effectiveness. A leaked memo from the Joint Chiefs of Staff in April urged Trump to retain the Department of Defense’s WPS programming, calling it “a low-cost, high-yield uncontested advantage over our competitors” that contributed to preventing radicalization, disrupting trafficking networks, and countering China and Russia. The Trump administration has abandoned the consensus that women’s participation and perspectives add value to U.S. security policy and operations. Last month, Hegseth again took aim at women’s inclusion in the U.S. military, cutting the Defense Advisory Committee on Women in the Services, which he accused of “advancing a divisive feminist agenda.” The committee was established in 1951 under President Harry Truman. It focused on addressing challenges facing female service members, such as ill-fitting body armor. The Trump administration is trying to rebrand any attention to women and gender equality in U.S. foreign policy as radical left-wing overreach. But it is the White House’s rejection of a bipartisan consensus going back more than 70 years that is the real break with the past.",https://foreignpolicy.com/2025/10/13/trump-women-rights-us-state-department-policy,Opinion,BBC,"Rebecca Turkington, Saskia Brechenmacher",https://foreignpolicy.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Afghanistan-women-doctors-GettyImages-2232006955.jpg?w=1000,2025-11-12T00:00:00,66c68f85b2a345787c77d5f3e69799e60e1ff28e
fac20dc6fa4b,Trump Has Broken the Justice Department,,"In his second administration, U.S. President Donald Trump has succeeded in turning an institution of legal justice into his own personal weapon. A fragile wall was constructed to separate the Department of Justice (DOJ) from the political interests of the Oval Office in the aftermath of Watergate in 1974. In a matter of months, Trump has shattered that wall, using a legal team at his disposal to go after domestic opponents and conduct political investigations. The most recent shocking example of how far the president is willing to go occurred last week when New York Attorney General Letitia James was indicted for mortgage fraud. James is the latest person to be targeted by Trump’s DOJ. Trump has been venting about James ever since she won a civil fraud case against him and his family business. The news comes just weeks after U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia, Erik Siebert, concluded that there was insufficient evidence to move forward with indictments of former FBI Director James Comey, who along with James has been another one of the people at the very top of Trump’s list of enemies due to his role in investigating possible connections between the 2016 Republican presidential campaign and Russia. Under pressure from the president to resign—in late September, Trump told reporters, “Yeah, I want him out”—Seibert stepped down from his position. Trump replaced him with Lindsey Halligan, a 36-year-old former insurance lawyer from Florida with no prosecutorial experience. Keeping up the pressure, Trump sent out a message on social media directed at Attorney General Pam Bondi, stating in clear language : “JUSTICE MUST BE SERVED, NOW!!” Days later, Halligan brought the case to a grand jury in Virginia, which then indicted Comey. Trump has also fired DOJ prosecutors who were connected to cases against him, and he has attempted to pressure law firms who handled parts of the investigations into signing punitive agreements at the risk of losing security clearances. Top FBI agents have been let go and said that it was done for no reason other than they had antagonized Trump and his supporters. Most recently, FBI Director Kash Patel reportedly fired an agent who refused to arrest Comey and escort him in a “perp walk” in front of reporters. Well before the end of Trump 2.0, conditions will be worse than they were at the end of Watergate, given that the current attacks are taking place in broad daylight and with the imprimatur of House and Senate Republicans. The new DOJ will be incapable of upholding the Constitution irrespective of who is president. Unless Congress acts soon, the Department of Justice will be irreparably damaged. Established in 1870, the Department of Justice had a problematic history long before President Richard Nixon sat in the Oval Office. President Woodrow Wilson’s final attorney general, A. Mitchell Palmer, conducted the “Palmer raids” from 1919 to 1921 as part of that era’s Red Scare, which targeted socialists and communists. Thousands of people were imprisoned without due process. A smaller number of people were deported. Attorney General Harry Daugherty, who had previously served as a campaign manager for President Warren Harding, was forced to resign in 1924 after he was implicated in the Teapot Dome scandal, which revolved around the secretary of interior accepting bribes from oil interests. Between 1961 and late 1964, President John F. Kennedy’s brother, Robert, served as the attorney general and authorized FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover to conduct wiretapping operations into civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr. But nobody corrupted the independence of DOJ as thoroughly as Nixon. During his tenure from 1969 to 1972, Attorney General John Mitchell—who had been Nixon’s campaign manager—expanded illegal wiretap and sabotage operations into the anti-war movement. He also investigated and leaked negative information about the president’s political opponents. Mitchell worked to prevent the New York Times from publishing the Pentagon Papers in 1971 . He resigned on Feb. 15, 1972, to head the Committee to Reelect the President (unofficially abbreviated as CREEP), the group that was in charge of the break-in of the Democratic National Headquarters in the Watergate complex. In 1975, Mitchell was convicted for his role in the scandal, serving 19 months in prison. Richard Kleindienst, who replaced Mitchell and upheld his hard line against domestic anti-war protesters, was involved in the cover-up. He resigned on April 30, 1973. During the Saturday Night Massacre in October 1973, Nixon wanted his new attorney general, Elliot Richardson, to fire Special Prosecutor Archibald Cox, who was demanding that the president release recordings of White House telephone and Oval Office conversations. When Richardson and then-Deputy Attorney General William Ruckelshaus resigned rather than carrying out the order, Nixon found someone else—Solicitor General Robert Bork—to do the job. Finally, as heard on the “smoking gun” tape from 1972 once the Supreme Court forced the recording’s release, Nixon and Chief of Staff Bob Haldeman wanted to have the CIA stop the FBI from conducting its investigation into the entire matter. As a result of the Watergate scandal—which culminated with Nixon announcing his resignation on Aug. 8, 1974—Americans finally came to recognize how dangerous it was for the DOJ to be a mere extension of the presidency. Under an imperial president, the strategies of intimidation, harassment, and the abuse of power could be triumphant. “People began thinking that the Justice Department was just like all the rest, and couldn’t be trusted to do what was decent and honorable and right,” admitted Richard Thornburgh, who later served as one of President Ronald Reagan’s attorneys general, in 1977. During the years that followed, a series of attorneys general pursued reforms that attempted to ensure the integrity of the agency. President Gerald Ford’s second attorney general, Edward Levi, for instance, set up the Office of Professional Responsibility to monitor activities within the DOJ. Levi also imposed new limits on FBI activities. Under President Jimmy Carter, Attorney General Griffin Bell announced that most communications about cases had to go through his office or his two top aides. In September 1978, Bell assembled DOJ lawyers in the great hall of their building to articulate three key principles that he insisted would guide the agency moving forward. First, there had to be guidelines to prevent them from allowing political considerations to drive their work. Transparency would be vital. Outside of policy initiatives, communication had to be severely restricted. Second, DOJ had to strive to protect its public image as a neutral government body. Finally, the attorney general had to maintain a staff of honest and principled lawyers who could be committed to these values. “I believe that our primary mission is to serve the Government as professionals,” he told the lawyers gathered before him, “to exercise our independent judgment and to do our duty as we see it. But the partisan activities of some Attorneys General in this century, combined with the unfortunate legacy of Watergate, have given rise to an understandable public concern that some decisions at Justice may be the products of favor, or pressure, or politics.” The changes, Bell told the press, would be essential to “restoring and maintaining public confidence in the Department of Justice.” Attorney General Benjamin Civiletti, who took over the position in 1979, incorporated these principles into internal DOJ rulebooks. Future Attorney General Merrick Garland—who was a special assistant to Civiletti, according to the Atlantic ’s Franklin Foer—“sat by Civiletti’s side as he continued the work of reforming the Justice Department: writing new rules and procedures to prevent another president from ever abusing the institution. They were preserving the rule of law by bubble-wrapping it in norms, so that it would be thoroughly insulated from political pressure.” Congress also enacted important reforms in the 1970s. In 1976, the House and Senate passed legislation that restricted the FBI director to a single 10-year term for. The goal was to prevent another leader from retaining power for as long as Hoover (who served for almost 48 years) while simultaneously ensuring that they would have sufficient autonomy from the president. Two years later, Congress passed the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, which created a FISA court that was responsible for approving surveillance operations on U.S. citizens. That same year, Congress enacted the Ethics in Government Act, which established an independent counsel to investigate wrongdoing in the executive branch. Once appointed by the attorney general, the law made it very difficult for anyone, including the president, to encroach on the work of the special counsel. While Democrats and Republicans allowed the law establishing the Office of the Independent Prosecutor to expire in 1999—frustrated about lacking any kind of control of these prosecutors, who became fodder in the intensifying partisan battles of the era—the rest of the reforms that insulated DOJ worked fairly well. While there were examples when the lines between presidential politics and legal justice became blurred, overall, the division stood the test of time. Even when Trump strained these barriers in his first term, there were enough so-called adults in the room to push back against his efforts. In 2025, Trump has been much more successful accomplishing his goal. As part of his broader effort to assert total control over the executive branch—fulfilling the vision that proponents of the “ unitary executive theory ” have been championing since the 1980s—Trump is systematically destroying any remaining independence within DOJ. With a president who doesn’t abide by guardrails—and is surrounded by staff eager to test the constitutional limits of executive authority—this has become dangerous state of affairs for the nation. The lessons of Watergate, entrenched in the reforms of the 1970s, have been picked apart. As a result, the Department of Justice, which the nation relies on to uphold law and order, has been folded into the full authority of the president, who can do what he pleases with this important agency. In dismantling the independence of the Department of Justice, Trump has rewritten the boundaries of executive power and in doing so has eroded the strength of the rule of law within the democracy.",https://foreignpolicy.com/2025/10/13/justice-department-trump-watergate-reforms,Opinion,BBC,Julian E.

3b6842f16c75,Doctor in Gaza Says Cease-Fire Brings Hope but Challenges Remain,,"The recent agreement between Israel and Hamas for an initial phase of U.S. President Donald Trump’s peace plan has prompted a sense of relief across the region. A cease-fire has now begun, and the remaining hostages in Gaza are set to be released in the coming days. Israelis and Palestinians have been celebrating the deal and are hopeful that it will lay the groundwork for a permanent end to the devastating war, which began two years ago after a Hamas-led attack on Israel. The conflict has left Gaza in ruins and is estimated to have killed more than 67,000 Palestinians. Israel has been widely accused of committing genocide in Gaza—where a famine was declared in August—and of weaponizing aid . There are myriad challenges ahead for advancing the peace process while also addressing the needs of those impacted by the war. To get a better understanding of the situation on the ground at this crucial moment, Foreign Policy spoke with Mathieu Bichet, a deputy medical director at Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF), on Thursday. FP’s conversation with Bichet took place just hours before the Israeli government voted to approve the deal for the “first phase” of Trump’s plan and a day before a cease-fire began. Bichet is in MSF’s field hospital in Deir al-Balah after being evacuated from Gaza City amid Israel’s offensive there. He offered insights on how Palestinians are responding to the cease-fire agreement as well as the ongoing problems they’re facing on issues ranging from supply shortages to addressing mental health. This interview has been edited for length and clarity. Foreign Policy: First of all, how are you? How is your team? Mathieu Bichet: So, myself, I’m fine. The team today is quite happy and hopeful regarding the cease-fire. That was on everybody’s face this morning, this afternoon. But then we are also grieving our two colleagues who died recently. We lost two of our colleagues in a strike on Oct. 2. FP: I’m so sorry. What is the mood like on the ground after this deal? Are people optimistic? MB: Yes, despite there still being some bombing. But now it’s been a while and I haven’t heard anything. When rumors emerged last night that a cease-fire will come, we started to hear some happy shooting. This is a way to celebrate, which is probably not completely appropriate, but it shows the happiness of the people. Then, of course, with our staff, we could notice that they were happy and full of hope. FP: You recently had to evacuate from Gaza City. What are some of the biggest challenges you’ve faced in conducting your work during the Israeli offensive and after evacuating? MB: The main challenge in Gaza City was the security. That’s why, in the end, we had to evacuate, because there was shelling all the time, everywhere. The trigger for our departure was the arrival of the tanks inside the city next to our clinic—about 700 meters from our clinic. That was considered a red line for us and we had to leave. Security was the main challenge. But then of course there’s a challenge with materials, medication. Shortage of supplies—that’s a really big challenge, and that’s all over the [Gaza] Strip. FP: What are the biggest areas of need in terms of equipment and materials? MB: Sterile gauze. That’s the first thing I would say. Also, medication. It’s mainly basic items. It is mainly dressing material, bandages, all those very crucial items. FP: And are the shortages largely just due to continued Israeli restrictions on aid coming into Gaza and movement of aid within Gaza as well? MB: Yes, of course, that’s completely linked with those restrictions. The complexity of having a channel of supply is definitely a huge challenge for all the health workers here. That’s clear. FP: Are you hopeful that this Israel-Hamas agreement will make it easier to get supplies and help people? MB: Hopeful? Yes. But I don’t know whether this issue of supplies will still be used as a way to constrain the strip. We do have some hope. There are tons of materials that are waiting outside of the border. I think yesterday we succeeded in bringing in our materials. But it’s not only about MSF, it’s about the WHO [World Health Organization] and all the other actors. So, I don’t know exactly how this cease-fire will be in terms of the flow of humanitarian aid. And it’s, of course, not only about what is necessary to operate the health sector but also the food. FP: Can you talk more about what it was like to evacuate from Gaza City? MB: I’ve been in Gaza for about a month. I spent only three or four days in Gaza City. I was supposed to replace one of my colleagues there. We were doing our handover when our headquarters said, “OK guys, now it’s getting too serious, and we cannot stay.” So, we had to evacuate the staff and move all our things in order not to lose them. And, of course, the same day we had to see all the patients who were waiting. More than 150 patients were waiting. We had to give them instructions, a little bit of supplies, and explain to them how to continue to apply their bandages when we are not here anymore. This clinic was basically for wound care. But extremely complex wounds—very often infected, and people of all ages. There were also wounded patients facing malnutrition. This category of patients have these chronic wounds that are often infected. Malnutrition is a comorbidity that is not in favor of proper healing. The situation regarding access to food, when I was there in Gaza City, was very precarious. When you go to the south, you see in the market a little bit more food, but it’s still extremely expensive. There are kids who are malnourished. FP: How does the situation in Gaza compare to other conflict zones you’ve worked in? MB: Last year, I was in Sudan, in Darfur, which is also a traumatic situation with a great volume of displaced persons, extreme violence, malnutrition, epidemics, etc. So, for me, it’s a bit difficult to compare. But what is unique here, amid the carpet bombing that the people are suffering, is that they cannot escape. They cannot escape, and this makes it quite unique. And the level of technology that is used to harass and to kill—in my experience of 20 years with MSF—is quite unique also. Everything that is used to target, to destroy, is massive. When you enter Gaza City, you’re speechless in your car for minutes because you’re like, “I can’t believe it.” Even if you saw photographs before. FP: Just in terms of the level of destruction? MB: Yes, the level of destruction. I don’t understand, nobody understands. The people have no hope. They’re just like, “It has to stop. Why? Why?” They ask, “Why my daughter? Why my brother? Why my little sister?” It’s unbelievable. And I never saw, except maybe after the [Haiti] earthquake in 2010, a volume of wounded people like that in the street, in the health facility, in the waiting rooms of the health facility. Some of those cases should be hospitalized, but there’s no more beds. The bed capacity is overwhelmed. FP: Can you talk about the mental health challenges that Palestinians in Gaza are facing? I can imagine that it’s especially difficult for Palestinians who are working with NGOs [nongovernmental organizations] like MSF, where they are helping to address a situation that is also impacting them. They are also starving, they are also facing bombings and losing family—and yet they are trying to help. MB: Our colleagues are openly sharing with us their feelings about that. I spoke to a person working with another NGO—we were discussing ways to collaborate on some issues—and she was saying that if it was just about us, we would stay at home and cry, but we are waking up in the morning just to do our job because patients are there and this is what we need to do. So, they continue. They tell us that working is their way to cope. They are really heroes who are working every day. FP: It’s obviously been hard to even address basic needs in Gaza, including water and food. But mental health is important. Is it difficult for organizations like MSF to address mental health issues in a conflict zone like Gaza? MB: Yes, it is. It’s all the strip that’s affected. We try to complete our care for patients with the mental health team and psychosocial programs. But we do not currently have an open program that will address this for the entire population, because it’s not possible for us. The targeted population for us is our wounded patients. Some of our other MSF colleagues are taking care of malnutrition in children. They will have this activity that is combined with their medical activity. This is what we do in our organization because it’s too difficult to address this need. FP: What will your top priorities be during the cease-fire as more aid flows in? MB: We have different branches of MSF here, so we try to complement each other. One of them is in charge of maternity and children. And three others, we are focused on trauma care and burn[s]. Burn care and trauma care is massive. There are also those complicated wounds among a large volume of population that need to be addressed. We are working with other organizations to cope with this. So, this is the priority. I would say the other priority is water. We are doing water trucking, which other organizations are also doing. So, we are providing drinkable water in different places for the population. But I would say that trauma care is still one of the main needs. FP: Is there anything that you would like to say that you think is particularly important for the outside world to understand about the situation in Gaza and what you’ve been seeing there on the ground? MB: Wow, many things. Honestly, what is shocking—and sorry to repeat myself—is the magnitude and the level of harassment with the use of technology like drones. This includes suicide drones. There are bombs that are supposed to target a specific person, but they’re killing, like, everybody within 20 meters. The intensity of the killing here—nobody understands the meaning of it. And I think something that people need to understand is, you know, why? Why are all those innocent people supposed to die? It’s unbelievable that this country is applying this advanced military technology to kill and destroy. Why? And the systematic attack on hospitals. I’m not even talking about the schools—I saw so many schools run by the U.N. destroyed. Why? It’s crazy. Sorry, I’m just a medical doctor. I’m not an analyst. But, again, why?",https://foreignpolicy.com/2025/10/10/msf-doctor-gaza-ceasefire-hamas-israel-trump,Opinion,BBC,John Haltiwanger,https://foreignpolicy.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Gaza.jpeg?w=1000,2025-10-17T00:00:00,e56088f9d10a96b61aa8deb7fa1caa2dcd415b35
22a437998e88,The Israel-Hamas Cease-Fire Has Taken Effect. What’s Next?,,"Welcome back to World Brief, where we’re looking at the next steps in the Israel-Hamas peace process, the ouster of Peruvian President Dina Boluarte, and parliamentary upsets in Japan and France . Sign up to receive World Brief in your inbox every weekday. The Next 72 Hours Tens of thousands of displaced Palestinians began returning to northern Gaza on Friday as the Israel-Hamas cease-fire took effect. The official truce is just the first phase of U.S. President Donald Trump’s peace proposal , but it marks the start of what many hope will become a lasting peace in Gaza and a potential pathway to independent Palestinian statehood. As celebrations erupted across the region on Friday, officials are now turning to negotiations on the second phase, which includes Israel’s complete withdrawal from the enclave, Hamas’s total demilitarization, and a new governing structure for Gaza. Here is what to expect out of the next 72 hours: As of Friday, Israeli forces began their slow, partial withdrawal from parts of Gaza, including most urban centers. The Israeli military will continue to operate defensively from the roughly 50 percent of the territory that it will continue to control. And the United States will send around 200 troops to Israel to help monitor the cease-fire, working alongside a team that includes other nations, nongovernmental organizations, and private sector partners; some U.S. troops have reportedly already arrived in Israel. Israeli forces also gave the United Nations the green light on Friday to begin delivering large quantities of aid into Gaza. These deliveries are expected to begin on Sunday and will include 170,000 metric tons of assistance already positioned in neighboring nations, such as Egypt and Jordan. Israeli restrictions on the flow of aid entering Gaza have triggered a devastating humanitarian crisis that has reached famine levels in several areas. Israel and Hamas are slated to exchange 48 Hamas-held hostages (of whom around 20 are believed to still be alive) for more than 2,000 Palestinian prisoners. The deadline for both sides to do so is 12 p.m. local time on Monday, though the deal leaves open the possibility that some remains of deceased hostages will not be returned immediately , as Hamas has warned that it may take longer to retrieve all of the bodies; the group has requested unimpeded access across Gaza to conduct the transfers. In exchange, Israel will release 250 Palestinians serving life sentences and around 1,700 others—including all women and children—who have been detained from Gaza since Hamas’s Oct. 7, 2023, attack. Of the 250 life-sentence prisoners being freed, 159 are from the Fatah political party, 63 are Hamas members, 16 belong to Palestinian Islamic Jihad, and 12 are with the communist Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine or other groups. On Monday, Trump will travel to Israel to address the Knesset on the cease-fire deal as well as to meet freed hostages. He will then fly to Egypt, where he will take part in a signing ceremony with the leaders of Egypt, Qatar, and Turkey. Later that week, Trump is slated to convene world leaders for a summit in the Egyptian city of Sharm el-Sheikh (where the latest round of negotiations were held) to discuss next steps in the peace process. The leaders of France, Germany, Indonesia, Italy, Jordan, Pakistan, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, the United Arab Emirates, and the United Kingdom are expected to attend, though as of Friday evening, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is not. Today’s Most Read What We’re Following Presidential ouster. Peru’s unicameral Congress voted unanimously on Friday to remove President Dina Boluarte from office over her government’s inability to curb the nation’s crime rates. Lawmakers established a debate and impeachment trial late Thursday and asked Boluarte to attend. When the president didn’t show, Congress went through with her ouster and chose 38-year-old José Jerí, the legislative body’s leader, to be the interim president. Boluarte has faced eight attempts to remove her from power since taking office in December 2022, with investigations looking into alleged bribery and deadly government crackdowns on protesters. But crime remains one of Lima’s biggest concerns. More than 6,000 people were killed in Peru between January and mid-August, the highest number during the same period since 2017. On Wednesday, Boluarte partially blamed immigrants (without providing evidence) for the rise in crime, the same day that members of the popular cumbia music group Agua Marina were injured in a shooting during a concert. A normal Peruvian presidential term is five years, but Boluarte was Lima’s sixth leader in less than a decade. Boluarte took power after her predecessor, Pedro Castillo, was removed from office for attempting to dissolve Congress. Elections to choose a new president are slated for next April. Fracturing parliaments. Japan was on track this month to welcome its first woman to serve as prime minister: veteran conservative lawmaker Sanae Takaichi . However, a rare split in the governing coalition appears to have thrown that possibility into contention. The ruling Liberal Democratic Party’s (LDP) junior partner, Komeito, left the coalition on Friday to ally with opposition groups that are seeking an alternative candidate. According to Komeito leader Tetsuo Saito, the two parties’ 26-year partnership ended over the LDP’s failure to address a political funding scandal that emerged in 2023. Komeito party members have also criticized Takaichi’s anti-immigrant rhetoric and repeated visits to the controversial Yasukuni Shrine, which honors Japan’s war dead, including convicted World War II war criminals. To add fuel to the fire, Komeito has hinted that it may back Yuichiro Tamaki, the head of the populist Democratic Party for the People, for the premiership. Such a move could disrupt the LDP’s nearly uninterrupted rule since its inception in 1955. As Japan’s Diet reckons with new fractures, another nation’s parliament is also struggling to reach a consensus. French President Emmanuel Macron summoned mainstream party heads to Élysée Palace on Friday to try to win support for a new prime minister, who would be France’s sixth in less than two years. The meeting did not include the far-right National Rally or far-left France Unbowed parties, which have been instead calling for snap elections and Macron’s resignation. However, in a move likely to anger both the left and right, Macron on Friday reappointed Sébastien Lecornu to be prime minister. Lecornu resigned from the premiership on Oct. 6 after less than a month in office following anger over his pick of defense minister and continued frustration with his administration’s efforts to pass a controversial budget. T-Dome security. Taiwan is preparing to build a new multilayered air defense system to counter increasing military and political pressure from neighboring China, Taiwanese President Lai Ching-te announced on Friday. The system, to be named Taiwan Dome (or T-Dome), reflects Taipei’s efforts to modernize its armed forces against new Chinese stealth fighters, aircraft carriers, and missiles. As part of the T-Dome proposal, Lai vowed to introduce a special budget by the end of this year that would increase defense spending to more than 3 percent of island’s GDP; the goal would be to reach 5 percent by 2030. Although the details of how T-Dome would work remain unclear, one senior presidential office official told Reuters that Taiwanese leaders “are hoping to build a more thorough air defense net with a higher interception rate,” with another source likening it to Israel’s Iron Dome. Beijing denounced Lai’s actions as a recipe for further antagonization. “This once again exposes his stubborn nature as a troublemaker, creator of danger, and a war-maker,” Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Guo Jiakun said. He accused Taiwan of “seeking independence by force.” Beijing does not recognize Taiwan’s sovereignty. What in the World?

Attempting to bribe different protest factions B. Forcefully repressing the protests C. Lying about its efforts to resolve protesters’ concerns D. Appealing to Mozambique for police reinforcements Odds and Ends Venezuelan opposition leader María Corina Machado won the Nobel Peace Prize on Friday for her work toward establishing a democratic transition in Caracas. Machado, long in hiding within Venezuela, has campaigned against President Nicolás Maduro’s government while pushing for free and fair elections. Last year, Machado was disqualified from running against Maduro as part of a government campaign targeting political dissidents. “Despite serious threats against her life, she has remained in the country, a choice that has inspired millions,” Norwegian Nobel committee chair Jorgen Watne Frydnes said. “When authoritarians seize power, it is crucial to recognize courageous defenders of freedom who rise and resist.” Machado’s humble response to receiving the recognition: “I hope you understand this is a movement, this is an achievement of a whole society. I am just, you know, one person. I certainly do not deserve this.” And the Answer Is… B. Forcefully repressing the protests Youth-led protests in Madagascar and Morocco could spur more Generation Z-led demonstrations in other African countries suffering from high costs of living and unemployment, FP’s Nosmot Gbadamosi writes in Africa Brief.

But the troops, some of whom have already arrived in Israel and will continue to do so through the weekend, won’t be there to conduct offensive operations and won’t be going into Gaza, a U.S. official told Foreign Policy on Friday. The troops will focus on planning and establishing a civil-military coordination center, the official said, without offering specifics on precisely where it will be in Israel. The official spoke on condition of anonymity due to the developing and sensitive nature of the matter. The center will “help facilitate the flow of humanitarian, logistical, and security assistance into Gaza during this cease-fire agreement implementation process,” the official said. “Secondly, it will also serve to monitor the implementation of the cease-fire agreement [to] ensure that it remains on track.” The United States is deploying up to 200 troops to Israel to help oversee the Gaza cease-fire process in coordination with regional partners, including Egypt, Qatar, Turkey, and the United Arab Emirates.

The center will “help facilitate the flow of humanitarian, logistical, and security assistance into Gaza during this cease-fire agreement implementation process,” the official said. “Secondly, it will also serve to monitor the implementation of the cease-fire agreement [to] ensure that it remains on track.” The aim is to provide a hub for coordination to avoid introducing chaos “in an already strained area,” the official said, and the center will look to “unify the effort to maximize the flow of support that is poured into Gaza.” The effort is designed to help lay the groundwork for the goal of transitioning to civilian governance in the territory, the official added. The U.S. official could not say how long the deployment might last, stating that there are a lot of “unknowns.” The task force will be spearheaded by U.S. Central Command, which is led by Adm. Brad Cooper. White House spokesperson Karoline Leavitt wrote in a post on X on Thursday that the troops “are already stationed” at Centcom and “will be tasked with monitoring the peace agreement in Israel, and they will work with other international forces on the ground.” Some of the troops being deployed are already in the region, but others are coming from the United States. This announcement comes after Israel and Hamas reached an agreement to implement the initial phase of U.S. President Donald Trump’s Gaza peace plan . A cease-fire is now in effect, and Israeli forces have completed a partial withdrawal , pulling back to an agreed-on line in Gaza. Hamas is expected to release the remaining hostages in the coming days, though the deal leaves open the possibility that the remains of some deceased hostages may not be immediately returned due to Hamas’s inability to locate them. More humanitarian aid will also flow into Gaza beginning this weekend. The peace plan included a call for the United States to collaborate with Arab and other international partners to immediately deploy a temporary international stabilization force to Gaza. The civil-military coordination center will work in support of this force. Despite cautious optimism, much remains up in the air when it comes to Trump’s plan. There are serious challenges ahead for moving the process forward and reaching an agreement that would lead to a permanent end to the war. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Friday signaled that he’s willing to restart the war if Hamas does not disarm—another element of the peace plan and one that Hamas has not yet agreed to. “Hamas will disarm, and Gaza will be demilitarized. If this can be achieved the easy way, all the better; if not, it will be achieved the hard way,” Netanyahu said . When asked whether there were causes for concern regarding the deployment of U.S. troops to Israel amid this period of uncertainty, retired Gen. Joseph Votel, who oversaw U.S. military operations in the Middle East from 2016 to 2019 as the head of Centcom, told Foreign Policy : “I am always concerned about the safety of our troops—but if this small deployment can catalyze the security response, then it is worth it.” “Our recent experience in Lebanon is a good model for this—we provide leadership, connectivity, and advice to our partners. Without knowing many details, this seems like a prudent deployment that supports our interests,” Votel added. This post is part of FP’s ongoing coverage of the Trump administration .

Trump’s threats came after China sharply expanded its export controls for rare earths, the powerful materials that underpin everything from semiconductors and clean energy technologies to the U.S. defense industry. Beijing dominates the world’s rare-earth supply chains, commanding about 85 percent of processing and 92 percent of magnet production. That has given it key leverage that it’s harnessed in multiple rounds of negotiations after Trump first launched his trade war in April. U.S. President Donald Trump on Friday threatened to unleash new tariffs on China and cast doubt over a potential meeting between him and Chinese President Xi Jinping later this month in South Korea, further escalating a now monthslong trade spat between the two powers. Trump’s threats came after China sharply expanded its export controls for rare earths, the powerful materials that underpin everything from semiconductors and clean energy technologies to the U.S. defense industry. Beijing dominates the world’s rare-earth supply chains, commanding about 85 percent of processing and 92 percent of magnet production. That has given it key leverage that it’s harnessed in multiple rounds of negotiations after Trump first launched his trade war in April. Under Beijing’s new controls, which are set to take force on Dec. 1, foreign firms must secure approval from the Chinese government to export magnets and certain semiconductor materials that include at least 0.1 percent Chinese rare earth content . The moves will “safeguard national security and interests,” the Chinese Ministry of Commerce said in its announcement . In particular, export licenses with military purposes are not likely to receive approval, according to the ministry . The ministry will approve export applications involving artificial intelligence and semiconductors on a case-by-case basis . In a separate announcement , Beijing also unveiled fresh export controls targeting the battery supply chain, which are set to begin on Nov. 8 . The moves, if implemented fully, amount to a dramatic escalation of a trade spat between the world’s two biggest economies, industry experts said. “These are the most stringent export restrictions on rare earths that China has imposed,” said Gracelin Baskaran, director of the Critical Minerals Security Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. “These magnets are crucial for our defense technologies, and by making it near impossible for defense companies and the military to access them, it cripples our industrial base,” Baskaran said. The series of moves was certain to ratchet up the pressure between Beijing and Washington ahead of expected upcoming talks between Xi and Trump in South Korea at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum, which starts on Oct. 31. But after Beijing’s latest measures were announced, Trump said in a post on Truth Social that “now there seems to be no reason” to meet his Chinese counterpart. “There is no way that China should be allowed to hold the World ‘captive,’ but that seems to have been their plan for quite some time,” he declared. In his post, Trump added that Beijing had sent letters to other countries announcing its new curbs. “Dependent on what China says about the hostile ‘order’ that they have just put out, I will be forced, as President of the United States of America, to financially counter their move,” he said. That could include steeper tariffs, he said. “One of the Policies that we are calculating at this moment is a massive increase of Tariffs on Chinese products coming into the United States of America,” Trump wrote. “There are many other countermeasures that are, likewise, under serious consideration.” Chris McGuire, who formerly served at the National Security Council and U.S. Department of State under the Biden and Trump administrations, said that Washington has significant levers that it could pull, particularly with regard to semiconductor chip supply chains. While the United States has previously imposed narrowly targeted controls on select semiconductors, he said, Washington has the power to go even further. “If the Chinese are going to try to threaten to shut down our entire semiconductor ecosystem with rare-earth controls—if they’re actually intent on doing that—then they should be aware that we have the ability to extend this into a much broader swath of their commercial ecosystem as well,” he said. Some lawmakers have pushed for other forms of pressure. In January, Republican Rep. John Moolenaar, the chairman of the House select committee on China, and Democratic Rep. Tom Suozzi introduced legislation aimed at revoking China’s permanent normal trade relations status. (Republican Sens. Tom Cotton and Jim Banks introduced companion legislation in the Senate.) In September, Moolenaar also urged the Trump administration to launch a coordinated effort with U.S. allies to jointly squeeze Beijing by targeting China’s commercial aviation landing rights, commercial aerospace parts and services, and outbound investment. In response to China’s latest announcement, Moolenaar reiterated those calls in a statement on Thursday. “China has fired a loaded gun at the American economy,” he said.

20318276e504,China’s Tech Obsession Is Weighing Down Its Economy,,"Yet equally persuasive are signs of structural weaknesses : rising debt, an aging population, a collapsed real estate market, and rising youth unemployment. China’s economy, some say, has peaked . “ Involution ,” or wasted production, is not only the word of the year in China but for some is another sign of an inescapable downward growth spiral. If this trajectory continues, China will find it impossible to escape the middle-income trap . If China’s economy slows down or stagnates, nearly 1 billion people could be stuck in low-income livelihoods. Observers often favor one or the other of these diametrically opposed images. Some argue that China’s innovation prowess is overstated, while others say the debt and demographic challenges are more manageable than some people assume. Our own view, based on extensive fieldwork in urban and rural China that yielded large amounts of qualitative and quantitative data, is that there is truth in both and that the key challenge is to integrate them into a single, unified vision of the country’s economy. The split screen of techno-wizardry on one side and empty apartment complexes and struggling villages on the other conveys valuable yet only partially accurate pictures of a complex country. One of us previously described China as a “ fat tech dragon ,” generating tech breakthroughs but wasting vast quantities of resources that were never properly metabolized in the Chinese economy. Almost a decade later, China now looks more like a “slow tech dragon,” one weighed down by its own heavy tail defined by a misallocation of resources, low income growth, and neglect. In many cases, both the upward signs and the worrying ones may seem unconnected but are really two sides of the same coin. A seemingly bifurcated picture is still one country, and the roots of both the optimism and the pessimism are the same.

AFP via Getty Images By every measure, China’s technology capabilities have improved dramatically in recent decades. From 2010 to 2025, China’s rank in the Global Innovation Index , the gold standard for tech development, rose from 43rd to 10th. China now sits first among 36 upper-middle-income economies and 3rd in the Asia-Pacific, trailing only Singapore and South Korea. China’s spending on research and development jumped 475 percent between 2007 and 2023, placing it just behind the United States. In 2017, China’s scientists for the first time published more papers than their U.S. counterparts. By 2022, their papers also were being cited more often by other scholars. China has long led the world in the number of filed patents but since 2019 has led with the most filings of globally recognized “PCT” patents, an objective sign of quality. In 2015, China launched the infamous “Made in China 2025” plan to accelerate its indigenous capabilities and market share in a wide range of high-tech sectors. Analyses by Bloomberg , the Information Technology & Innovation Foundation , the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and Rhodium Group , the Wire China , and others show that the risky initiative largely paid off, with substantial advances in domestic technical capabilities, value added, and market share in most of the targeted industries. The focus on innovation has contributed to growth by dint of expanding inputs (extensive growth) and improving the productivity of those inputs, particularly technological upgrading and the strengthening of human capital in urban China. China’s factory labor used to be “cheap”—now it is becoming higher-skilled. Factory workers now do much more than simple, repetitive tasks; they have to act with precision, interact with advanced machinery and processes, and make judgments about quality. Investments in national logistics, electricity, IT infrastructure, and regional tech hubs have provided a foundation and an environment for firms to develop new products and improve their manufacturing processes. Equally important, industrial policy has facilitated spillovers across related industries, allowing progress in one sector to contribute to advances in others. Despite all of this amazing and rapid progress, the high-tech push has not translated into maintaining rapid growth and a stronger macroeconomy. After the boom-boom years of 1980 to 2010, China has seen an uninterrupted 15 years of slowing growth and rising debt—and the tech push is part of the problem. China has made some smart bets, but the political signals from planners have resulted in massive overinvestment in several technologies. China has more than 100 EV makers ; there used to be even more. The number of companies investing in humanoid robots has exploded. While officials have many ways to attract new entrants, they have much more difficulty pushing out bad firms and consolidating sectors. Through easy access to funding (often through local governments) and a weak bankruptcy law, both state-owned and private firms still have soft budget constraints, allowing them to stay afloat long beyond what the market would bear. Although both Chinese and Western media often report on China’s tech successes, industry and product failures are common, costly, and rarely discussed. China’s sweet spot is moderately difficult technologies that can be tweaked and improved incrementally and then sold in massive amounts at low margins. China has had more difficulty in the most complex, advanced technologies where economies of scale are less valuable. Despite hundreds of billions of dollars in investment over several decades, China is still a minor leaguer in commercial aviation, even as domestic air travel has boomed. The regional C909 (formerly the ARJ21) and narrow-body C919 depend almost entirely on Western components. Efforts over the past decade to design a homegrown aircraft engine have yet to bear fruit. China has made some progress in semiconductors , particularly with legacy chips, packaging, and testing, but it is still heavily dependent on the West for advanced chips, chip design software, and manufacturing equipment. China continues to lag others for similar reasons in complex fine chemicals , quantum computing , and high-end precision machining . Of course, the most infamous area where good money has gone after bad is in real estate, which in the past has accounted for as much as 30 percent of the economy. Local governments, starved for cash, leased their land to developers, who went on building binge unprecedented in human history. Historian Vaclav Smil has documented , for example, how China used more cement in three years than the United States used in the entire 20th century. When local governments ran out of money, China’s developers instead started taking deposits from owners even before shovels hit the ground. In the past several years, property prices have tumbled—despite government efforts to prop them up. By one measure , China has more than 60 million empty residential units. Despite the government’s desire to shift growth drivers from infrastructure to tech, the real estate crisis is still dragging down the rest of the economy.

Wang Zhao/AFP via Getty Images A key reason success in tech is not translating widely into the macroeconomy is the lack of connectivity to other critical sources of broad-based development, namely China’s massive pool of human capital. China is seeing striking success in frontier technologies such as batteries and solar, but this does not yield rapid economic growth since these industries are relatively small and capital-intensive rather than labor-intensive. As capital has been drawn to priority sectors, investment in areas that might produce greater employment or income growth has been crowded out. For all of China’s prowess in manufacturing and e-commerce in cities, and forestry and mining in the hinterland, China lags far behind in many high-value-added service sectors. Among the most prominent are healthcare and education, labor-intensive sectors that would soak up urban employment and provide services that would strengthen human capital. It is possible that new technologies, once diffused through the economy, could eventually help lift all boats. But standing in the way of this diffusion is the mismatch between the kind of work created by advances in frontier technology, which tends to require higher skill levels, and the skill levels of China’s labor force, which on average are very low. In fact, China has one of the most poorly educated labor forces in the upper-middle-income world. The relatively late expansion of secondary education in China, which only really took off in the 2000s, means that some 60 percent of China’s labor force has not attended even one day of high school. While this will change over time, it will still take decades to achieve the levels that South Korea and Ireland had when they were middle income and striving to move up to high-income status. No country in the world has successfully moved from middle- to high-income status with the low levels of aggregate human capital that China has today. Who are we discussing here? We are not talking about the 400 million reasonably well-educated people that constitute China’s middle class, who by themselves outnumber the population of the United States and dominate the modern media image of China. We are also not talking about those in dire poverty—this segment of the population is now only a small fraction of what it was 30 years ago. According to the calculations of China’s State Council, there is no one under the nation’s poverty line. Rather, we are talking about, as China’s former Premier Li Keqiang reminded , the 900 million people who are living on about $10 a day, often in the thousands and tens of thousands of small cities and rural townships and villages in China’s interior. They have poor levels of education and health and have little or no access to long-term job security, benefits, or savings. This article is featured in the FP Weekend newsletter, a curation of our best book reviews, deep dives, and other reads that take a step back from the drumbeat of the news. Get the lineup directly every Saturday. They matter not just as people but as the heavy tail weighing down an economy that might otherwise soar. Uneven employment among this huge part of the labor force could, most simply, crowd out growth in high-tech sectors. In an advanced economy, a large part of the labor force needs to know math, science, how to use computers, and have language skills to find gainful employment and contribute to growth. In the past, China’s labor force did not need to be highly educated because workers were engaged in labor-intensive manufacturing and construction. But as countries approach high-income status, not only does the share of labor in manufacturing and construction fall, but the demands on the labor force in all sectors rise sharply. White-collar jobs replace blue-collar ones, and it is imperative that the labor force is well educated, with the skills needed in a high-skill/high-wage economy, so that large shares of the once blue-collar workers can now begin to work in offices and contribute to keeping the economy from falling into the middle-income trap. This is where the Chinese economy’s demand for a skilled labor force is almost certainly going to run into the reality of China’s massive poorly educated bloc of workers. In simplest terms, a large portion of China’s 600 million rural workers will not be able to upgrade into an expanding number of white-collar jobs. They are the part of the labor force that made it through junior high school—for the most part—and they simply will not be able to compete with their better-educated (and mostly urban) peers. A high-income China will still need a large number of blue-collar workers, but it will not need 300 million to 400 million of them. Take the uneven spread of e-commerce businesses in China. Entrepreneurs leveraging e-commerce to sell goods or launch businesses abound in China’s big cities, where the educated classes are clustered. Many of these businesses fail, but some launch small entrepreneurs into bigger leagues. E-commerce platforms have been heralded as a means of linking rural goods with urban consumers, offering an economic lifeline for underemployed rural communities.

Jade Gao/AFP via Getty Images But research has shown that only the most educated or wealthy populations in rural areas (often urban individuals coming out into the countryside) can take advantage of the platforms. The vast majority of rural people simply do not have the skills or knowhow to take advantage of this new moneymaking opportunity. Indeed, this is an example of how China’s human capital shortfall could leave hundreds of millions of people unable to capitalize on a modern economy. So, what will these people do? They are being squeezed out of manufacturing, and after the collapse of the real estate bubble, huge numbers of rural workers are no longer needed for construction. Most fundamentally, many in China’s labor force cannot compete in the skilled jobs of the future. Many have moved into the gig economy, driving rideshare or delivery vehicles, or have joined other informal sectors in such numbers that wages and working conditions may even be falling. Over the past 15 years, the share of China’s labor force in the informal economy has risen from some 40 to 60 percent . Others might have no option but to go back to the farmland owned by their families —even though most young rural workers (under 35 to 40 years old) have never farmed, do not know how to farm, and do not want to farm. Most importantly, considering the nation’s future development, in any of these scenarios their contributions to growth are minimal: They have low income, low or no benefits, and low job security. In short, many of those in the rural labor force may not be able to help themselves, are unlikely to consume much, and are poorly positioned to help China grasp “new quality productive forces,” in Chinese President Xi Jinping’s words. The strength of an economy is typically measured in physical attributes, but the attitudes of households, workers, and consumers also matter. Interviews and survey data show that over the past several years, a deep sense of uncertainty and worry has come to grip many Chinese and foreigners who do business with the country. From top to bottom, among both Chinese and foreigners, there is a crisis of confidence about China’s trajectory. For the past three years, multinationals and global institutional investors have debated the question “Is China investible?” Fears about China’s statist policy orientation, the economic slowdown, and hardening tensions with the United States have led many, though far from all, to answer in the negative. The domestic conversation in China does not use the same language, but the anxieties are not that different. Pedestrians in a crowded street surrounded by small shops, with a person selling balloons in the foreground. Pedestrians peruse small shops on a crowded street in Changsha, in China’s Hunan province, on Sept. 7, 2020. Hector Retamal/AFP via Getty Images Multiple executives from China’s private companies have told us that they are holding back investment because they do not expect a strong recovery in domestic demand. All they need to do is cite China’s consumer confidence index , which nosedived in April 2022, when Shanghai went into lockdown as COVID-19 swept through the city, and has flatlined since. Such pessimism reflects a historic shift. Recent research by Martin King Whyte, Michael Alisky, and one of us clearly shows that there has been a fundamental decline in the level of optimism about the economy across China’s population. A nationally representative survey in 2014 revealed that a large majority of people in China—including those who were below the median level of income—believed they were better off than they were five years earlier and that they would continue to be better off five years into the future. In the 2014 survey, low-income respondents tended to blame their own shortcomings rather than any systemic problem with China’s economy. But in 2023, the same survey revealed the opposite: Sharply fewer respondents reported having improved prospects compared with the previous five years, and most poorer people blamed the economy rather than themselves for their low levels of income. These conflicting elements are visible everywhere you look in China. Take the city of Changzhou, in the heart of the manufacturing powerhouse of Jiangsu and an hour northwest of Shanghai by high-speed rail. The city is home to a growing number of EV battery-makers, including Svolt, which has a stunningly modern manufacturing facility that is 95 percent automated. Svolt batteries have gradually increased in density and driving range, and the company provides them to several major automakers, including Great Wall, Leap, and Geely. Svolt has nine other facilities around the country and a factory in Thailand. Yang Hongxin, Svolt’s young CEO, gave one of us a data-rich presentation that revealed how far the company had come and the path it needs to follow to remain competitive. But at the same time, when one of us visited the Svolt headquarters, worrying signs were easy to find. Svolt ranks fifth in China’s highly crowded battery market, and with supply far outpacing demand, the debt load to carry massive inventories is substantial. The company’s automated factories are impressive but create relatively few jobs. A nearby shopping mall had fancy-looking stores and displayed the latest models from Li Auto, but there were few shoppers. Across the road was a large residential compound with more than a dozen high-rise apartment buildings that, according to one contact, sat empty. This combination of strengths and weaknesses could describe hundreds of Chinese cities. Equally, visits to EV giant BYD’s Shenzhen headquarters in May 2018 and July 2025 revealed huge advances in battery chemistry, density, and safety and the range and design of BYD cars. BYD boasts not only super inexpensive models but also luxury lines that are challenging Audi and BMW for market share. BYD has highly advanced labs to study acoustics and radiation and a crash test facility that has been certified by regulators around the world. At the same time, Shenzhen, the iconic city of China’s manufacturing boom, reflects the economy’s strains. The slowdown in domestic demand and growing international tensions have forced many companies to fold and workers to lose their jobs. Even those doing relatively well are struggling in many respects. BYD now has almost 28 percent of China’s EV market and more than 22 percent of the global market —double that of Tesla!—but its debt levels have also risen dramatically. In 2025, shopping malls that one of us visited in the city were half-empty, with more lookers than buyers; restaurants suffered from lots of open tables. The only growing class of consumers are Hong Kongers who ride the high-speed rail up to Shenzhen on weekends looking for bargains. Or consider villages in the south of Shaanxi province. Repeated field trips over the last three decades showed that between the early 1990s and the mid-2010s, the income of households went up, driven mostly by remittances from family members who had emigrated. Today, through interactions with the families that we have been in contact with for decades, we know that many young people do not make enough to maintain their own low-level standard of living. Young rural workers are sharing jobs, living in small rooms with many other migrants, and jumping from job to job to job, all in the informal economy. Because of this, many older people are barely getting by. The average age of a male farmer in a rural village is more than 60 years old. At a time when urbanites are retiring, rural older people are still working, struggling to make ends meet, trying to save every penny because of the risk that is in their future. And this certainly means they are keeping consumption to as low a level as possible. China’s tech success and macroeconomic malaise are linked. The system is tilted strongly in favor of industry and technology relative to households and consumers. While state-direct financial institutions have funneled trillions of dollars to priority projects and business, the country’s wages are low , the social safety net is underdeveloped , and household investment options are far and few between. Homes have ceased to be a store of value, and the stock market, while currently on an upswing, has been flat over the past decade and a half and has yet to prove itself as a pathway to greater wealth. The tilted playing field, with all of the waste, means a monumental misallocation of resources. While Chinese firms can tout new tech breakthroughs, in study after study , both by scholars and international institutions , it can be shown that productivity growth has slowed and contributed much less to overall GDP growth than in the past. Some, such as scholar Jean Oi and her co-authors , believe that the funneling of resources to industry and tech represents an essential “guns or butter” trade-off, that China has finite financial resources—with debt levels around 300 percent of GDP—and hence faces a zero-sum choice between pursuing technological preeminence and consumer-driven growth. There may be something to this, but it is just as likely that policymakers have decided to put their eggs in the tech basket and for a variety of reasons and are hesitant to take substantial steps to support workers and consumers. This may be the product of a pro-tech materialist ideology and a belief that too much support for workers would make them lazy. It may also be motivated by worsening international tensions in which China’s traditional technology suppliers in the West have made it clear that they will not be reliable suppliers going forward. Regardless, this does appear to us as a question of policy choice and political will, not finite resource constraints. If authorities in China wanted to address the sources of low productivity in the economy, they could still support high-tech sectors but would need to take other steps to resolve both the short- and long-run challenges faced by millions of low-income Chinese. First, there is a great need for unemployment insurance for rural workers. Currently, rural workers are not eligible for unemployment insurance because, in the view of state planners, they can always go back “home” and farm—even though this is not realistic for most. Further weakening hukou (residency) restrictions—allowing rural people to move into cities of all levels to get access to higher-quality housing, schooling, health care, and social security—would almost certainly help low-income people upgrade over time. And leaning into several direct approaches to boosting human capital would pay dividends, including upscaling early childhood development programs, improving the quality of preschools and primary schools, and making academic high school (versus vocational high school) available to all who want to attend. Of course, all of these initiatives are expensive, and China’s fiscal constraints are not entirely mythical. Residents of China’s big cities who have enjoyed preferential access to services and opportunity for decades may be reluctant to share. But we believe such efforts are absolutely necessary for the expansion of a healthy economy in the short, medium and long run. If done properly, they will pay for themselves in time as the investments grow China’s economic pie. Two people on either side of a partially constructed electric vehicle on a production line.

Jade Gao/AFP via Getty Images Regardless of which path China pursues, the United States and others will face challenging circumstances. If China continues to lean entirely in the direction of “new quality productive forces” and remains a slow tech dragon, it will continue to make real breakthroughs in tech, but the weaknesses of human capital and domestic demand will exacerbate existing imbalances at home and abroad. In turn, that will produce further polarization between the winners and losers in the domestic economy and between China and other countries whose technology-oriented sectors will come under greater threat from China’s exports. Under such circumstances, the pressures for others to de-risk or even decouple from China will only grow. And, of course, one can easily imagine China responding by using its own carrots and sticks—far beyond just rare earths—to attack foes and attract supporters. No reform is costless. If China instead sought to address the structural weaknesses in its economy, this would require costly adjustments that would create new winners and losers domestically and painful tensions with them. China’s growth trajectory would be less directly threatening to the tech sectors of other countries, and consumers in China would be better able to absorb more imports—which may be a hard sell for a leadership so strongly focused on self-reliance. Yet, at the same time, an economically reformed China would also have an overall much stronger economy that would make it an even more formidable force on the international stage.",https://foreignpolicy.com/2025/10/10/china-tech-ai-innovation-economy-stagnation,Opinion,BBC,"Scott Kennedy, Scott Rozelle",https://foreignpolicy.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/China-tech-dragon-development-tech-GettyImages-2187442299.jpg?w=1000,2025-11-12T00:00:00,fb6d66dfb0b763e838a3082832c12fc6e177fee1
2b56595666dc,You Already Know What ‘Sumud’ Means,,"On my first trip to Palestine as an adult, I visited the Church of the Nativity in Bethlehem, where I was drawn to a large, painted wooden sculpture of St. George slaying a dragon. According to the inscription at its base, it was a gift from the town’s prominent Dabdoub family—my maternal family, who have lived in Bethlehem since the Crusades. When I asked my local guide why the statue was there, he shrugged and gave a one-word answer in Arabic: “ Sumud .” St. George is regarded as a hero among Palestinians; one Bethlehem sculptor has described him as “a knight full of peace and grace, riding his horse and always fighting evil.” On my first trip to Palestine as an adult, I visited the Church of the Nativity in Bethlehem, where I was drawn to a large, painted wooden sculpture of St. George slaying a dragon.

When I asked my local guide why the statue was there, he shrugged and gave a one-word answer in Arabic: “ Sumud .” St. George is regarded as a hero among Palestinians; one Bethlehem sculptor has described him as “a knight full of peace and grace, riding his horse and always fighting evil.” “Sumud” often gets translated as “steadfastness” or “perseverance” (or misunderstood by Israelis as “clinging to the land”) but is more properly inflected with notes of audacity, conscience, and dignity. Palestinians name their kids Sumud, but other than that, a person doesn’t announce their sumud. It is attributed to them by others in the manner of chutzpah, moxie, or rizz. Sumud is both an immovable object and an unstoppable force; like St. George, sumud is a dragon slayer. Arabic is spoken by around 400 million people across roughly 30 dialects, but sumud is a particularly Palestinian term—and it has been since 1978 , when the PLO recommended sumud as a coping mechanism for the trauma of life under Israeli occupation. The word recently gained international recognition while the Global Sumud Flotilla, a civilian-led convoy of more than 40 vessels carrying humanitarian aid, sailed from Europe in an attempt to break Israel’s blockade of Gaza. Italy and Spain dispatched navy ships to protect the flotilla, and leaders from Colombia, Malaysia, South Africa, and Turkey condemned Israel’s military interception of the flotilla earlier this month.

Mohamed Fliss/AFP via Getty Images Raja Shehadeh, the co-founder of the Palestinian human rights group Al-Haq, describes sumud as “watching your home turned into a prison” and choosing “to stay in that prison because it is your home and because you fear that, if you leave, your jailer will not allow you to return.” In his published journal, The Third Way , he wrote, “Living like this, you must constantly resist the twin temptations of either acquiescing in the jailer’s plan in numb despair, or becoming crazed by consuming hatred for your jailer and yourself.” A popular Western understanding of sumud is the way that Palestinians have responded to Israeli officials cracking down on displays of the Palestinian flag. Many people now celebrate watermelons for their natural showcase of black, green, red, and white—the colors of the flag. It’s a puckish subversion: In the age of social media, a watermelon emoji has reach where a Palestinian flag emoji gets shadow-banned . Sumud is the way that a Palestinian refugee camp known as the most tear-gassed place on Earth turns gas canisters into jewelry for its gift shop. It’s the epic dream of the West Bank’s Rawabi , the first planned city in Palestine. It’s Handala , a cartoon symbol of a 10-year-old refugee who has had his back turned since 1973 . It’s the determination of children in the West Bank to see the sea. Nearly half of all Palestinians are children—or were, at the genocide’s start. Every Palestinian birth is an act of sumud. Sumud is also Husam Zomlot, born in a refugee camp in Rafah, becoming ambassador to the United States and then the United Kingdom. It’s the Palestinian tech start-up scene . It’s the journalists in Gaza who make recorded statements to be played after Israeli weapons finally come for them . Sumud unwittingly captured the world’s hearts for a moment in March when it manifested as an elaborate iftar banquet served in the rubble of Gaza. This summer, Israeli National Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir posted a 13-second clip of himself taunting Marwan Barghouti , a Palestinian political leader who has been imprisoned for 20 years. Barghouti’s wife, Fadwa, combed the video to find one frame that she believed showed her husband’s strength and asked his followers to use that image in their dissemination of the encounter. That moment is sumud. Wherever there are Palestinians, there is always sumud. Others might argue that Palestinian identity is defined by Nakba , the Arabic word for catastrophe that is used to refer to the mass slaughter and displacement of Palestinians through the founding of Israel in 1948. But a people’s darkest hour is rarely the hinge of its heritage. A child carrying belongings walks on a sidewalk next to a fence. In the distance are vehicles laden with people and belongings. Displaced Palestinians move with their belongings in the Nuseirat refugee camp area in the central Gaza Strip on Sept. 23. Eyad Baba/AFP via Getty Images Palestinians are used to being misunderstood. Stereotypes portray all Palestinians as terrorists , rather than counter-terrorists fighting Israeli occupation and genocide. Sumud is the confidence in knowing that many of the people who call Palestinians terrorists are not terrorized by our weapons but rather by our very existence, by the Palestinian pulse that beats like a tell-tale heart under Israel’s papering over Palestine . In our interconnected age, sumud is available to anyone online. It shows up in the name of outreach programs in U.S. churches , in a clothing label that sells Che Guevara sweatshirts , on a Finnish tote bag , in British song lyrics , and in a nonprofit fragrance sold in Oregon. Mashallah . In fairness, the world is full of misappropriated foreign concepts— aloha , la brega , duende , hygge , ikigai , jugaad . And clumsy cultural exchanges are endemic to the West, where people buy knock-off empathy with catwalk keffiyehs, performative rolled Rs, or questionable Chinese tattoos. Despite its Palestinian specificity, sumud reveals global truths. The United States and Palestine might seem like opposite worlds: the land of opportunity versus the land of occupation. But sumud is far from foreign to U.S. history. American sumud is the Chinese poetry scraped into the walls of Angel Island in San Francisco Bay. It’s Emmett Till’s mother demanding an open casket. It’s First Lady Jacqueline Kennedy refusing to change out of her blood-splattered pink Chanel suit. (“Let them see what they’ve done,” she is said to have declared, in an accidental definition of sumud.) American sumud is a motel-turned-civil rights museum in Memphis, Tennessee. It is spelled out in the names on the Vietnam Veterans Memorial . It’s a Puerto Rican flag draped bandana-style out of the Statue of Liberty’s crown. It’s the AIDS quilt being unfurled over the National Mall. It’s the presence of absence at the 9/11 Memorial. It’s the shoe collection at any Holocaust museum. And it’s painting—and repainting —rainbow crosswalks in Orlando, Florida. American sumud knows that revolutions don’t start with chants or marches or even riots, but rather with the sacred, silent stillness of students sitting at a lunch counter in Greensboro, North Carolina, or a 42-year-old seamstress planting herself in a bus seat in Montgomery, Alabama. “My resistance is not to run away,” Mohsen Mahdawi, a Palestinian student who was recently reinstated at Columbia University after being detained for his activism, said last month. “It’s easier to distance myself and go somewhere else, [but] I choose to be part of a solution, part of a resistance, and part of envisioning what the future would look like.” A woman in a headscarf tosses a child into the air, both smiling.

Majdi Fathi/NurPhoto via Getty Images In a landmark year for global support of Palestinians, U.S. sympathy for Israel has fallen below 50 percent—to 46 percent—for the first time in the 25 years that Gallup has tracked this sentiment, as sympathy for Palestine reached an all-time high of 33 percent. That shift is in large part driven by U.S. revulsion at Israel’s brutality in Gaza, of which 60 percent of the U.S. public now disapproves, according to a separate Gallup poll. Jewish Americans are also overwhelmingly negative on Israeli violence and war crimes. The global community, as well, understands sumud. “ Tank Man ” inching left and right alone against the Chinese military in Tiananmen Square. The odometer hitting its millionth mile in a freshly painted and polished vintage pastel Chevy in Havana. Or the hitokage-no-ishi , the human shadows scorched in stone, at the Hiroshima Peace Memorial Museum. Sumud is not a burden or a stain on a people. Humans have shared an instinct for sumud since our cave-dwelling days when we left handprints on walls. That art was not a matter of territorial ego; recent archeologists have discovered that they may have actually been testaments to family, community, and shared joy. We’ve come a long way from those caves, but not as far as we like to think. Sumud is the eternal reminder of have-nots and how easily people mistreat those have-nots. It is the indictment of Israel’s brutality, of the U.S. government that funds it, and of the wider world that watches it with little more response than a wagging finger. Yet Palestinian have-nots refuse to be-not. We are alchemists who transform leaden deprivation into Oscar gold . That is sumud: unapologetic ownership of the knowledge that a person’s very existence has power untouchable by brute force or craven cruelty. If the United States is the world’s melting pot, then Palestine is the world’s mortar, where humanity is crushed and pulverized into its essence.

Turning away from the crowd to look directly into the camera , he reveals his true colors. Addressing us, the viewers , he refers to his supporters not as heroes but as outcasts, “people at the bottom of the barrel” whose anger and resentment he will harness to satisfy his own political ambitions. “Follow me,” he grins, turning his back towards the roaring crowd. “You’ll love me too. You’ll become fascists too.” Son of the Century , directed by Joe Wright and currently available in the United States via the streaming service MUBI, is based on a 2018 book of the same name by Italian author Antonio Scurati. Most would describe it as a work of historical fiction, but Scurati prefers a different, more specific label: documentary novel. “Facts and characters,” a disclaimer reads, “are not the product of the author’s imagination,” but taken directly from reputable sources and eyewitness accounts. Scurati’s goal, it stands to reason, was not simply to tell an engaging story, but to make sense of the past in a way that conventional historical analysis could not. Joe Wright on the set of M: Son of the Century. Director Joe Wright on the set of Son of the Century . Andrea Pirrello The same can be said of the novel’s televised adaptation, which promises to get to the core of what fascism was all about. With its expressive cinematography, techno-inspired soundtrack, and constant breaking of the fourth wal l, the series aims to tell us where fascism came from, how it rose to power, and why it remains a relevant force in both Italian and international politics more than 80 years after its inventor was beaten to death beyond recognition and strung, head down, from the roof of a gas station in a northwestern suburb of Milan. Because of its commitment to the aspirations of its source material, Son of the Century cannot be judged in the same way we judge most other period dramas. The historical settings of Wright’s Pride & Prejudice (2005) and Anna Karenina (2012) are just that: settings. It’s different when directors tell stories that don’t take place in history as much as they are about history itself, its meaning, and its significance. Think D.W. Griffith’s Birth of a Nation (1915), which celebrates the Ku Klux Klan’s role in the Reconstruction-era South, or Kathryn Bigelow’s Zero Dark Thirty (2012), which presented torture as instrumental in the so-called Global War on Terror. Like Son of the Century , these works cannot be evaluated on their creative merits alone. Aside from cinematography and music, we have to scrutinize their portrayal of people and events, the extent to which those portrayals reflect or refute established scholarship, and—perhaps most importantly when dealing with a legacy like Mussolini’s—how they influence our collective memory today. Fascism as depicted in Son of the Century —which concludes with the murder of socialist politician Giacomo Matteotti and the transformation of Italy’s parliamentary democracy into a one-party dictatorship—is little more than an empty vessel, a Rorschach test that means different things to different people. The squads of thugs tasked with maiming, murdering, and intimidating Mussolini’s opponents mainly use the movement as an outlet for their frustration and sadism, and they threaten to turn against their leader when his ascending political career calls for some conflicts to be resolved through diplomacy rather than deadly force. The cruelty depicted in the show is not an exaggeration: One researcher described the Blackshirt practice of pouring diarrhea-inducing doses of castor oil down the throats of their victims to harm and humiliate them as having reached “endemic proportions.” Similarly, Mussolini’s financial sponsor and mistress, the socialite and art critic Margherita Sarfatti, sees fascism as an expression of futurism, an Italian artistic and intellectual movement that embraced modernity and progress for the revolutionary change it would bring, eagerly anticipating a future where traditional morality no longer applies. She is, notably, the only character in the series to make this connection, and although Mussolini does not seem to truly share her vision, he never corrects her with a different, definitive ideology of his own. To him, it doesn’t matter what people see in fascism as long as they see something. “I am consistent,” he tells the viewer after he is elected to the Chamber of Deputies in 1921—a victory he achieved only by siding with landowners, businessmen, and other elements of bourgeois society he had previously opposed. “I betray everyone, including myself.” A black and white photograph of Benito Mussolini, arm rasied, giving a speech.

Keystone Archive/via Getty Images The series’ take on fascist ideology (or Mussolini’s alleged lack thereof) reflects academic research on the subject, which over time has moved away from studying fascism as a unified theoretical construct—be it an outgrowth of capitalism, a response to Bolshevism, or something else entirely—and towards studying fascism as a decentralized social phenomenon, with focus placed on the “how” as opposed to the “what” or “why.” Befitting its form, Son of the Century emphasizes the role of media and performance, showing how both were used to project non-existent strength while hiding real weakness. Both on screen and in actual history, this process is best illustrated by the March on Rome, a mass demonstration by Mussolini’s supporters in 1922 that resulted in his appointment as prime minister. While the violence involved in this event was real, the power behind it was not nearly as formidable as it appeared; although the fascists weren’t bluffing, they were certainly gambling. As seen in the series, Mussolini was prepared to escape to Switzerland and would have left the country had the march resulted in an actual confrontation with the army. The series, much like Scurati’s novel, attributes fascism’s ascent not to the cunning of Mussolini or the strength of his Blackshirts, but to the shortcomings of the government they replaced. As historian Denis Mack Smith put it in the New York Review of Books in 1968, infighting saw the liberal politicians of the early 1920s “almost competing against one another in their desire to invite Mussolini into power.” Fearing his generals would rise up against him, Italy’s king, Victor Emmanuel III, refused to sign Prime Minister Luigi Facta’s declaration of martial law, allowing the March on Rome to succeed in spite of its own organizers’ doubts. The king then appointed Mussolini prime minister, placing him in charge of a new coalition, despite the fact that the fascists were only a minority party in parliament. A few weeks later, parliament duly voted to give him dictatorial powers. “Democracy,” he says in one episode, “is beautiful. It even allows you the possibility of destroying it.” The series’ emphatic critique of Mussolini’s enablers reflects present-day concerns over democratic backsliding in the West, particularly in Italy and the United States. The final episode, which culminates in Mussolini’s 1925 speech that ushers in his 20-year dictatorship, ends on the word “silence”—as if to remind viewers what is lost when democracy falters. The 2024 Venice Film Festival, where Son of the Century premiered, also showed documentaries about Jair Bolsonaro and Donald Trump. “Make Italy great again,” Mussolini says to the camera, in English, following the March on Rome, an event which is shown to resemble the Jan. 6 riot in all but its outcome. Despite this obvious reference to current events, few critics have interpreted Mussolini and fascism as stand-ins for Trump and MAGA. This is surprising, not only insofar as many of the criticisms leveled against the former can and have been applied to the latter; Trumpism, too, has been described as ideologically incoherent, shaped above all by the whims of its idiosyncratic figurehead. But critics’ silence on the modern connection is also odd to the extent that the series and novels—in sharp contrast to some scholarship—treat Italian fascism as tailor-made for export across time and space.

Get the lineup directly every Saturday. Son of the Century ’s treatment of history has been largely well received. John Foot, a professor of modern Italian history at the University of Bristol, for example, finds little to complain about . But others have accused both Wright and Scurati of sensationalizing and trivializing, and not without reason. Although occasionally chipping away at the marble chin of Il Duce’s public persona to reveal a man whose outsized impact on the planet was more accidental than inevitable, the Mussolini we meet on screen is, ultimately, difficult to distinguish from the one constructed through his own propaganda. Luca Marinelli in M: Son of the Century. Marinelli in Son of the Century . Andrea Pirrello And with its melodramatic flair and blockbuster aesthetics, Son of the Century arguably makes its protagonist appear not just alive but larger than life. Wright’s direction, even more so than Scurati’s writing, turns Mussolini into an antihero rock star in the mold of Walter White in Breaking Bad or the Joker in the eponymous 2019 film. He is captivating despite (and, for some, even because of) the heinous things he does and stands for. As NPR critic John Powers summed up : “I can imagine [him] really enjoying this series.” In some ways, the most problematic aspect of Son of the Century is its very existence. It is, after all, nearly impossible to imagine television entertainment centered on Adolf Hitler, who—though certainly not identical to Mussolini in his convictions and crimes—remains the closest point of reference. The fact that the Italian dictator can be the star of his own television series (and for that series to include slapstick comedy, moments of sentimentality, and stylized excess reminiscent of a Quentin Tarantino film) is first and foremost a testament to the persistence and pervasiveness of his personal and political afterimage. There is a reason that one of the most recent books on Italian fascism, published in 2022 and written by historian Paul Corner, was titled Mussolini in Myth and Memory and not “Fascism in Myth and Memory.” Unlike Germany, Italy never fully reckoned with its totalitarian past. Decades after World War II, partly misplaced and partly fabricated nostalgia for Il Duce’s firm but supposedly benevolent leadership became the launchpad for the careers of other far-right politicians, from Gianfranco Fini and Silvio Berlusconi to Giorgia Meloni, not to mention three of Mussolini’s own progeny: granddaughter Alessandra , granddaughter Rachele, and great-grandson Caio Giulio Cesare. Certain movements die with their leaders, but leaders can live on in memory—even through TV shows that try to put them to rest.",https://foreignpolicy.com/2025/10/10/mussolini-son-of-the-century-review-series-fascism-italy-history,Opinion,BBC,Tim Brinkhof,https://foreignpolicy.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/0-son-of-the-century.jpg?w=1000,2025-11-12T00:00:00,74f3a8055529b0fe3b7f8a8c64a8a3363748e126
f3387fbe5bbe,Anchors Away,,"Case dismissed! At Helsinki District Court, a pivotal trial involving three international seafarers has just ended . The three officers were in charge of the shadow tanker that struck at least five undersea cables in the Gulf of Finland in December 2024. Now, the court has delivered its verdict in the high-profile case: Although it found the officers committed aggravated criminal damage, it ruled that Finland lacked jurisdiction to prosecute them. That means ships can cut cables with impunity almost everywhere. Or least they can for now. Prosecutors have just announced they’ll appeal the ruling, giving further hope to those who want to see accountability prevail. Case dismissed! At Helsinki District Court, a pivotal trial involving three international seafarers has just ended . The three officers were in charge of the shadow tanker that struck at least five undersea cables in the Gulf of Finland in December 2024. Now, the court has delivered its verdict in the high-profile case: Although it found the officers committed aggravated criminal damage, it ruled that Finland lacked jurisdiction to prosecute them. That means ships can cut cables with impunity almost everywhere. Or least they can for now. Prosecutors have just announced they’ll appeal the ruling, giving further hope to those who want to see accountability prevail. You may recall the dramatic scene on Christmas Day last year: Finnish border guard and police officers abseiling, in the dark, onto the Eagle S . The scene took place in the Gulf of Finland, where, in just a few hours, the tanker had struck one undersea power cable and four data cables . When the Finnish border guard and police intervened, the Eagle S was approaching another power cable. Had the Finns done nothing, the shadow tanker—which was en route from Russia’s Baltic port of Ust-Luga—could have struck not just that cable but more data cables, too. Seizing the tanker was a daring move. The Cook Islands-flagged Eagle S belongs to Russia’s shadow fleet, a collection of vessels that transports Russian oil to countries like India and China in violation of the Western price cap on Russian oil. That makes the fleet indispensable to Russia. The Finns knew that if they tried to seize the tanker, Russia might retaliate in some fashion. And there was another problem: When the Finns seized the Eagle S , the ship was in Finland’s exclusive economic zone (EEZ), and the damage done was in its EEZ, too. In their own territorial waters, which extend for a maximum of 12 nautical miles from the shoreline, countries have full jurisdiction, but that’s not the case in a country’s EEZ. The United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) decreed that in their economic zones, coastal states only have “sovereign rights” for the purpose of specific economic and environmental activities. Having police and border guard officers detain a ship in the EEZ and move it to territorial waters was assertive and, in the eyes of some, not entirely legal. But as far as the Finns were concerned, they had to stop the Eagle S before it caused even more damage to the indispensable installations on the seabed. When they took control of the tanker, it had dragged its anchor for nearly 62 miles , and the Baltic Sea had endured more than two years of mysterious incidents involving cables and pipelines. In August, the ship’s captain and two senior officers were charged with aggravated criminal mischief and aggravated interference with communications and trial proceedings began the same month. Given that the cables were struck in the EEZ, the fact that there was a trial at all was a sign of Finland’s determination. It was also a gamble because the prosecutors would need to prove the officers’ intention to perpetrate harm. Would the Finnish prosecutors be able to demonstrate that the crew deliberately dragged the anchor? If they managed to overcome both the issue of jurisdiction and the issue of intent, other countries affected by cable incidents could decide to pursue the same strategy. On the trial’s first day, the three officers maintained their innocence, arguing that damage to the cables was an accident and a malfunctioning windlass had caused the anchor to fall into the water. The Eagle S is indeed a rusty old bucket, owned—like virtually all shadow vessels—by a brass-plate company. In the Eagle S ’s case, the owner lists the business center at a Dubai hotel as its address. Finnish journalists managed to identify the owner: a Russian-speaking woman who had an Azerbaijani passport and owned at least seven front companies. As the trial proceeded, the prosecutors delivered a mighty surprise. They were not going to address whether the three officers had deliberately dragged the ship’s anchor. Instead, they argued that by boarding a ship so unseaworthy that the windlass—which holds the anchor—could malfunction, the three men had demonstrated intent to cause harm. It was a clever way around the seemingly unsolvable dilemma of how to prove the intent to damage the cables. The prosecutors presented an innovative approach to the jurisdiction issue, too: Because the consequences of the criminal acts materialized in Finland, the country had jurisdiction. The prosecution delivered astounding facts. The tanker’s black box stopped recording its position just before the tanker hit Estlink2, the power cable. And on Jan. 7, when the Eagle S and its crew were being held in Finland, the ship’s management company— based in a small shared office building in suburban Mumbai—instructed the captain to destroy evidence . “Don’t share this list with anyone, please. Destroy it. Because they will come back and demand compensation from you for all the damage,” the company told the captain—neither realized that Finnish police were listening in. On Sept. 10, the trial ended. The prosecutors had demanded prison sentences of at least two and a half years . That may not sound like a lot, especially considering that the December incident has cost the cables’ owners at least 60 million euros . But a lot was at stake, including the crucial point of whether boarding a rust bucket is tantamount to intent to damage undersea installations. If the court agreed with the prosecutors both on the officers’ guilt and the matter of jurisdiction, then it could create a significant deterrent against cable cuts. On Oct. 3, the court delivered its verdict . The dragged anchor, it ruled, caused “very serious economic losses within the meaning of the statutory definition of the offense pursued by the alternative charge, i.e. aggravated criminal damage, which were incurred in Finland.” The prosecutors had convinced the court on the matter of intent, but it ruled that it was “not possible to apply Finnish criminal law to the case.” In other words, Finland lacked jurisdiction. With UNCLOS clearly distinguishing between territorial and non-territorial waters, the verdict was not entirely surprising. But it is concerning all the same. Finland tried to thwart cable incidents using the rule of law, and it failed. Countries may have a new legal tool against any sabotage that happens in their territorial waters. But if the upcoming appeal fails, prospective cable and pipeline saboteurs will be able to safely damage cables and pipelines so long as they stay outside of anyone’s territorial waters.",https://foreignpolicy.com/2025/10/10/finland-cable-cuting-russian-sabotage,Opinion,BBC,Elisabeth Braw,https://foreignpolicy.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/finland-cable-cuting-russian-sabotage-2190986465-e1760117114775.jpg?w=1000,2025-11-12T00:00:00,591bc18c0a974172e1afe61c3b176721f8dce0a3

At the heart of the concern is not merely the vast gulf separating the two sides’ positions or their asymmetry of power, but also that almost everything hinges on the guarantee of one man: U.S. President Donald J.

Throughout previous cease-fire negotiations, Israel and Hamas remained far apart on several issues, including the timing and totality of Israel’s military withdrawal from Gaza, the disarmament of Hamas, and the nature and structure of future governance in the territory.

Throughout previous cease-fire negotiations, Israel and Hamas remained far apart on several issues, including the timing and totality of Israel’s military withdrawal from Gaza, the disarmament of Hamas, and the nature and structure of future governance in the territory. In previous talks, including January of this year, mediators addressed the problem by proposing a phased implementation process in which the sticking points were pushed to the second and third stages while the two sides implemented a gradual captive exchange and the entry of humanitarian aid. Yet this phased process allowed the stronger party, Israel, to violate the cease-fire at the end of the first phase with impunity, once it had recovered a considerable number of hostages but before it had to take steps to end the war and withdraw. These dynamics are once again at play. Despite a broader proposal being tabled by the U.S. president, the negotiators in Egypt have clearly opted for a phased agreement—except this time, the remaining Israeli captives will be released in one go. The major sticking points in Trump’s plan, including the gaps between the version agreed to by eight Arab and Muslim states on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly in September and the one that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu revised and accepted in Washington a few weeks later, have not been addressed. That means that the remaining Israeli captives will be released with no guarantees that anything else will be concluded. While it is a positive that the people of Gaza will not have to wait out a long negotiation process to get some desperate reprieve, the durability of the cease-fire is questionable. And even if a broader agreement is somehow reached, Netanyahu may decide somewhere along the process of implementation that it serves his interests to abandon the deal and either resume his military campaign or find some other arrangement suitable to his interests. Underlying all of this, however, is a simple notion that makes even the phased negotiation and implementation structure irrelevant: Every concession made by Hamas is irreversible, while every concession made by Israel can be undone. For example, if Israel withdraws its military from Gaza one day, it can reenter the next; if it releases 1,000 Palestinian prisoners today, it can rearrest them tomorrow. On the other hand, once Hamas frees Israeli hostages, they are gone for good. If it decides to give up its weapons, a mechanism may be put in place to recover them if Israel reneges on the deal, but it will be hard-pressed to do so in practice. For Hamas, this underlying dilemma makes the guarantor of the agreement absolutely pivotal. Enter the less-than-reliable Trump . Although Hamas officials recently claimed that the group trusts the president to uphold the deal, this couldn’t be further from the truth—and with good reason. When Israel violated the January cease-fire in March, at the end of the first phase, it did so with Trump’s blessing. In fact, Trump undermined the deal partway through the initial stage by suggesting that Gaza be turned into a “Riviera” under the control of the United States and emptied of Palestinians—a ludicrous idea that made Palestinians seriously question his commitment to basic principles of legality, justice, and morality. This perhaps offhand and ill-considered idea gave Netanyahu the political cover to jettison the second and third stages of the cease-fire and openly pursue the goal of ethnically cleansing the Gaza Strip . Indeed, at every step along the way, Netanyahu and his government ministers claimed that their actions were made pursuant to the Trump plan. Trump’s credibility has only eroded from there . In June, he allowed Israel to carry out its surprise attack on Iran in the midst of U.S.-Iranian nuclear negotiations, even claiming that he had used a pending round of talks as a smokescreen for Israel . Finally, Trump was implicated in Israel’s attack on Qatar in September —having either allowed it to happen or failed to prevent it. Ironically, it was this blunderous decision by both Israel and the United States that likely created the opening for the current cease-fire negotiations. Galvanized by the attack, and recognizing the emerging threat to their own security, the Gulf states and other U.S. allies in the region rallied around Qatar and presented a united front to Trump, demanding, among other things, that he rein in Israel and reengage on a plan to end the slaughter and starvation in Gaza . As evidenced by Trump’s meeting with eight of these states in New York, from which the latest Trump proposal was born, this seemed to have the desired effect. This time around, Trump appears to be more personally engaged than in the past, with his credibility in front of respected regional allies on the line. Also crucial is that these states demonstrated the ability to act as a counterweight to Israeli influence on the Trump administration, enhancing the possibility that Trump applies the requisite pressure on Netanyahu that is needed for successful negotiations. Whether this dynamic between Trump and the Arab states will continue is an open question , but the emerging alliance between those Arab states, Turkey, and Europe is providing extra heft to their diplomatic efforts. As negotiations proceed, Hamas will have to make some decisions that will challenge the organization at its core. Its officials likely recognize at this point that they are at the end of the road; no one is coming to save the Palestinian people from Israel’s genocidal onslaught . Although momentum is building abroad, it would be foolish to hold out hope that international sanctions and arms embargoes are in the immediate offing and will be enough to stay Netanyahu’s hand while he continues to receive U.S. support. Meanwhile, Hamas is facing immense pressure and isolation, with even sympathetic countries such as Qatar and Turkey aligning with the position that it should disarm, and it holds virtually no cards beyond the hostages—who will likely all be back in Israel by next week. But how far will Hamas go in compromising on the terms of its own survival to ensure the survival of the Palestinian people in Gaza? How much will it compromise on its sacred principles, such as its right to bear arms and resist an illegal occupation until there is a resolution of the Palestinian question? There is also the issue of framing a larger political pathway to address Palestinian self-determination, which is not only important to the Palestinian side but also to all countries that will have a role in Gaza going forward. While that point was not addressed coherently in the Netanyahu-revised plan, no state wants to be enmeshed in an endless governance and security role in Gaza, especially while Israel continues to pursue its annexationist goals in the West Bank . This concern underlies some Arab and European states’ renewed enthusiasm for diplomacy in pursuit of the two-state solution, and it makes them more invested in ensuring that the deal under negotiation is both successful and has a political resolution at the end. At the very least, they are strongly advocating for the return of the Palestinian Authority to Gaza, which would partially relieve them of their direct involvement on the ground—although the Israelis are firmly opposed. Whether Israel wants a broader agreement or not is an open question. The country is heavily isolated and losing friends fast . The bigger issue is what will happen if Netanyahu decides to exit the deal once he achieves his objectives. Will Trump use the leverage over Israel at his disposal to force compliance? Netanyahu has shown that he knows how to pick his battles with Trump, and when forced to concede, outmaneuver him over time. Since Oct. 7, 2023, he’s also found that waging perpetual, multifront war to be an ideal arena for navigating politics—like being Willy Wonka in his glass elevator, pushing buttons and pulling levers to go in whichever direction he wants. If Netanyahu were to jettison the deal in full view of the world, there would likely be a large-scale backlash, with more countries signing up to take punitive action against Israel. But experience suggests that only pressure from Trump would force his hand—and that pressure is hardly guaranteed.",https://foreignpolicy.com/2025/10/10/gaza-cease-fire-deal-palestinians-trust-donald-trump,Opinion,BBC,Omar H.

050773b08eb1,Trump’s Nobel Peace Prize Obsession Isn’t Over,,"Another year, another failed attempt. U.S. President Donald Trump’s inability to secure this year’s Nobel Peace Prize was predictable. The odds that he will ever win the prize remain slim. Yet this latest knockback is only likely to redouble Trump’s desire to win in future years, putting renewed energy behind one of the most important yet underappreciated forces shaping U.S. foreign policy. In advance of Trump’s second election victory, many observers talked about taking him “seriously but not literally.” This was always foolish guidance, but it is especially so regarding his transparent obsession with Nobel recognition. Beyond mere vanity, this desire will continue to reshape global geopolitics—a point this latest perceived snub is only likely to intensify. Another year, another failed attempt. U.S. President Donald Trump’s inability to secure this year’s Nobel Peace Prize was predictable. The odds that he will ever win the prize remain slim. Yet this latest knockback is only likely to redouble Trump’s desire to win in future years, putting renewed energy behind one of the most important yet underappreciated forces shaping U.S. foreign policy. In advance of Trump’s second election victory, many observers talked about taking him “seriously but not literally.” This was always foolish guidance, but it is especially so regarding his transparent obsession with Nobel recognition. Beyond mere vanity, this desire will continue to reshape global geopolitics—a point this latest perceived snub is only likely to intensify. Trump’s willingness to strong-arm Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu into accepting a Gaza peace deal is only the latest example of the steps he is willing to take for peacemaker credentials. A roughly similar deal had been on the table during former President Joe Biden’s closing period in power. But Biden was unwilling to pressure Israel into accepting. Trump gambled on possible Nobel glory—and a shaky peace deal is the result. This month, Trump may stop briefly at the annual summit of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations in Malaysia. Previous U.S. leaders routinely skipped these gatherings, to predictable local irritation. Trump sees an opportunity, however—namely, to take further credit for having mediated in border clashes between Cambodia and Thailand. A press event burnishing his credentials for brokering peace makes the trip suddenly worthwhile. During his recent speech at the United Nations, Trump mentioned seven conflicts to which he has brought peace. No one is exactly sure which seven he meant, but they likely include mediation efforts between Rwanda and the Democratic Republic of the Congo, brokered talks between Armenia and Azerbaijan, and attempts to restart negotiations between Serbia and Kosovo. In each, Trump sees a notch toward Nobel consideration. This peacemaking impulse has many upsides, as his role in the new Gaza deal suggests. Trump’s team knows the recognition he seeks, leading to new U.S. diplomatic engagement in places that rarely receive it. Across the global south, governments often lament Washington’s tendency to focus on great-power competition, not complex regional conflicts. Now Trump’s Nobel hunger, however self-serving, has paradoxically forced sustained attention on disputes from Central Asia to Central Africa. There are a number of major problems, however, the most obvious being that foreign governments are quickly learning to exploit this impulse. Pakistan offers one clear example. “The Government of Pakistan has decided to formally recommend President Donald J. Trump for the 2026 Nobel Peace Prize, in recognition of his decisive diplomatic intervention and pivotal leadership during the recent India-Pakistan crisis,” Islamabad said in June. This public support was in turn an important part of a broader process whereby Islamabad has cleverly boosted U.S.-Pakistan ties in recent months. At the same time, U.S.-India relations are enduring their worst period in a decade or more. The result is a significant rebalancing of U.S. policy, with potentially major implications for Washington’s role in South Asia and beyond. Foreign leaders understand that Trump prizes photo opportunities above substantive outcomes, allowing them to extract concessions for cheap gestures. Not only does Washington risk giving away too much, but it likely means Trump will accept flawed agreements that create the illusion of peace without remedying underlying tensions. At base, Trump appears to believe that the sheer volume of peacemaking initiatives will force the Nobel committee’s hand. There is no reason to believe this is correct, but it is worth thinking through the implications his belief will have for future U.S. diplomacy. The most likely theater for Trump’s pursuit remains the Middle East. He and others in his administration remain keen to expand the Abraham Accords to include Saudi Arabia, brokering a deal with Israel with the potential to reshape the regional balance of power. In Trump’s own mind, his decision to bomb Iran’s nuclear sites in June counts among his wider peacemaking efforts, given the cease-fire that followed. A Saudi breakthrough would not only cement his view of himself as a historic Middle East dealmaker but also provide another case study for the doubting prize committee in Oslo. The Korean Peninsula is a second likely avenue. North Korea represents unfinished business following Trump’s fitful and unsuccessful attempts to make progress through talks with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un during Trump’s first term. In August, Trump met with South Korea’s new president, Lee Jae-myung, in the White House for the first time. At the meeting, he announced that he hoped to see Kim “this year,” raising speculation of a possible meeting on the sidelines of this month’s Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in South Korea. The odds of Kim traveling south are slim, but a further U.S. push on Korean Peninsula peace seems more likely than not. Ultimately, it is Trump’s chaotic policymaking style—his tendency to undercut negotiators, reverse positions, and prioritize personal ties over process—that will prevent him from winning the prize he desperately seeks. Nobel committees value sustained diplomacy and lasting change, not stage-managed press conferences. Even so, other nations will keep using these impulses to their advantage. This year, I met with a senior Chinese diplomat in Beijing, who gently probed about Trump’s peacemaker ambitions and their implications for North Korea policy. Behind the seemingly casual conversation lay a clear calculation: China was assessing how its leverage over Pyongyang might be used—or weaponized—in broader negotiations with Washington. If Beijing is gaming out Trump’s Nobel hunger, every sophisticated foreign ministry is doing the same. This singular drive for recognition is now a remarkably consistent guide to U.S. policy, indeed perhaps the most reliable predictor of where Washington’s diplomatic energy will flow. Put another way, Trump’s peacemaking ambition is now a primary variable in international relations—and one that should be taken both literally and seriously.",https://foreignpolicy.com/2025/10/10/trump-nobel-peace-prize-announcement,Opinion,BBC,James Crabtree,https://foreignpolicy.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/trump-nobel-peace-prize-GettyImages-685748744.jpg?w=1000,2025-11-12T00:00:00,ffcd26d262b38b4f7ab66d457b5687c52fef73d1
137d6676f66a,Is the Arizona Tech Oasis a Mirage?,,"Arizona’s desert is now home to some of the world’s most advanced semiconductor plants, hailed as proof that the United States has clawed back control over the technologies of the future. Politicians and pundits celebrated the arrival of the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) in Phoenix as a triumph of industrial policy, a sign that Washington can still bend globalization to its will. Ribbon-cuttings and glowing headlines told a story of sovereignty regained. Yet the latest clash with Taipei suggests otherwise. Just days ago, U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick demanded that Taiwan agree to a 50-50 split in chip production, with half relocated to the United States. Taiwan’s Vice Premier Cheng Li-chiun immediately pushed back , stressing that its negotiating team “has never made any commitment to a 50-50 split on chips … nor would we agree to such conditions.” Arizona’s desert is now home to some of the world’s most advanced semiconductor plants, hailed as proof that the United States has clawed back control over the technologies of the future. Politicians and pundits celebrated the arrival of the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) in Phoenix as a triumph of industrial policy, a sign that Washington can still bend globalization to its will. Ribbon-cuttings and glowing headlines told a story of sovereignty regained. Yet the latest clash with Taipei suggests otherwise. Just days ago, U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick demanded that Taiwan agree to a 50-50 split in chip production, with half relocated to the United States. Taiwan’s Vice Premier Cheng Li-chiun immediately pushed back , stressing that its negotiating team “has never made any commitment to a 50-50 split on chips … nor would we agree to such conditions.” The dispute coincides with U.S.-Taiwan trade negotiations revolving around a new reciprocal tariff regime. The United States has levied a 20 percent ad valorem duty on many Taiwan goods, but the White House has exempted some semiconductors from these additional tariffs. Taiwan, which in 2024 became the seventh biggest trading partner of the U.S., is concerned that many other key sectors—including data processing equipment, electronics and machinery, comprising much of Taiwan’s U.S. export—remain vulnerable in talks that have been complicated by Washington’s 50-50 chip demand. The episode underscores that, despite billions being poured into Arizona, Washington cannot dictate Taiwan’s industrial future. That reality points to the deeper paradox: the tech oasis taking shape in the desert may just be a mirage. Far from signaling independence, TSMC’s $165 billion investment is best understood as a hedge, an insurance policy against disruption in the Taiwan Strait. Since 2020, when TSMC launched its Phoenix project to appease U.S. President Donald Trump, subsidies under former U.S. President Joe Biden’s CHIPS Act have fueled its expansion. Now in his second term, Trump has hardened the rhetoric. Lutnick openly links Arizona’s semiconductor factories, known as fabs, to U.S. security commitments, dismissing the “silicon shield” theory that Taiwan’s chip dominance deters Chinese attack. His logic is blunt: If 95 percent of the world’s advanced chips are made in Taiwan, then those chips cannot defend Taiwan unless a significant share is also produced in the United States. What started as political theater has become a showcase of whose deeper logic is less about decoupling than about reconfiguring globalization. The more that Arizona is held up as evidence of independence—or at least a pathway to it—the more it reveals how tightly entangled the United States remains with Taiwan. The Arizona complex began as one modest fab and has grown into multiple facilities; by January 2025, the first was producing four-nanometer chips , hailed as historic by then-U.S. Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo. The symbolism was powerful: For the first time in decades, leading chips were being made on U.S. soil. Yet Taiwan remains TSMC’s crown jewel, with 10 fabs and five backend facilities there producing most of its chips, including its most advanced designs, with 11 more planned. Arizona will eventually host six fabs (it broke ground on the third in April)—important additions, but only a fraction of TSMC’s global capacity. The company has repeatedly emphasized that its center of gravity remains in Taiwan, with U.S. facilities meant to complement rather than replace its home base. The message is unmistakable: This is insurance, not a transfer of headquarters. And Taipei’s rejection of a 50-50 deal confirms that its leaders view retaining production dominance as essential to their security, not a bargaining chip to be traded away. The insurance logic is pragmatic. By diversifying production, TSMC reassures its American customers— Apple , Nvidia, AMD—that not every wafer is tied to the Taiwan Strait. It also reassures Washington. The second Trump administration can point to Arizona as proof that industrial policy delivers. The project has brought modest gains: a few Taiwanese suppliers that have set up locally , new training programs, and some packaging capacity. In a crisis, even partial domestic production offers more resilience than the United States had before, which was essentially none. But reassurance is not the same as sovereignty. The claim that Arizona marks a clean break in supply chains falters when examined closely. Arizona’s fabs still depend on Taiwanese engineers, Hsinchu-led research and development, and Asian-sourced inputs—proof that Washington has outsourced its onshoring. And in Taipei, an  opposition Kuomintang legislator warned that U.S. demands risk “exploiting and plundering” Taiwan’s advantages and weakening the very shield that deters Beijing. This is not self-sufficiency. It is dependency in a new form. Washington cannot claim genuine sovereignty when its premier manufacturing project relies so heavily on foreign know-how and supply chains. Meanwhile, China is moving faster to cultivate autonomy. By blocking Nvidia’s AI chips, Beijing has forced its domestic champions to innovate. Huawei’s Ascend clusters are beginning to provide alternatives , even if they fall short in efficiency. Yet without access to extreme ultraviolet lithography machines, China’s path to the cutting edge remains blocked. Still, the contrast is striking: While Washington celebrates symbolic decoupling, Beijing is building partial self-reliance. What Arizona really shows is not the end of globalization but its reinvention. Inside the fabs, equipment is Dutch , chemicals are Japanese, subsidies are American, and engineers are Taiwanese. Even chips produced in Arizona are often shipped abroad for packaging until U.S. facilities scale. The semiconductor remains the most globalized product in existence, and the Arizona experiment demonstrates that borders cannot contain it. This sits uneasily with the sovereignty rhetoric. Billions in U.S. subsidies are not flowing to Intel but to TSMC, a foreign company whose strategic decisions will always reflect the realities of Taipei and Hsinchu. Washington is effectively underwriting the transplantation of a Taiwanese ecosystem, hoping it will take root in the desert. That may sound like pragmatism—no American firm currently matches TSMC’s prowess—but it is hardly sovereignty reclaimed. The latest 50-50 standoff drives home the point: The United States cannot command sovereignty by fiat when the linchpin of its strategy is unwilling to concede control. The economics deepen the paradox. Arizona fabs cost at least 50 percent more than Taiwan’s, depend on subsidies, and still lean on imported talent. Training programs are underway , but building an expertise base to rival Taiwan’s will take years. The supply chain remains fragile. Despite a few Taiwanese chemical companies opening small plants in Arizona, most critical materials are still sourced from Asia. That tether leaves Arizona’s fabs vulnerable to disruption or delay. Without a full supplier ecosystem, the U.S. foothold will remain shallow, propped up by subsidies and political will. The strategic risks are sharper still. In a Taiwan Strait crisis, Washington would turn to Arizona as a safety net, but the net could prove too thin without scale. In that scenario, China—forced by sanctions to accelerate domestic innovation—might muddle through with indigenous capacity, while the United States would still be scrambling. And if, as has Lutnick argued, the United States’ ability to defend Taiwan rests on having half the production at home, then Taipei’s refusal leaves Washington with symbolism but not sovereignty. TSMC’s Arizona project is celebrated as proof that the United States is reclaiming sovereignty over the technology that powers artificial intelligence, advanced weapons systems, and the digital economy. The deeper story is less flattering. Arizona is insurance, not independence. For all its fragility, the project is not meaningless. It has created political reassurance, modest industrial gravity, and the seed of an American semiconductor workforce. Yet these are fragments, not foundations. It does not reduce dependency so much as reconfigure it. Far from decoupling, it underscores how tightly entangled the United States remains with Taiwan, even as China edges closer to partial autonomy. And the flare-up over a 50-50 split makes it clear that this entanglement is not just economic but political. Arizona may glitter in the desert sun, but without Taiwanese consent, it risks being remembered as an expensive mirage.",https://foreignpolicy.com/2025/10/10/tsmc-taiwan-semiconductor-arizona-tech,Opinion,BBC,Alejandro Reyes,https://foreignpolicy.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/GettyImages-2202605134.jpg?w=1000,2025-11-12T00:00:00,6786387d884bd85fb7145c605ef646c3e373fbcc

847f59f9c37e,Feds seize $15 billion from alleged forced labor scam built on “human suffering”,,"Federal prosecutors have seized $15 billion from the alleged kingpin of an operation that used imprisoned laborers to trick unsuspecting people into making investments in phony funds, often after spending months faking romantic relationships with the victims. Such "" pig butchering "" scams have operated for years. They typically work when members of the operation initiate conversations with people on social media and then spend months messaging them. Often, the scammers pose as attractive individuals who feign romantic interest for the victim.

It alleged that Zhi led such a forced-labor scam operation, which, with the help of unnamed co-conspirators, netted billions of dollars from victims. “The defendant CHEN ZHI and his co-conspirators designed the compounds to maximize profits and personally ensured that they had the necessary infrastructure to reach as many victims as possible,” prosecutors wrote in the court document, filed in US District Court for the Eastern District of New York. The indictment continued: For example, in or about 2018, Co-Conspirator-1 was involved in procuring millions of mobile telephone numbers and account passwords from an illicit online marketplace.

In addition to providing an ""AI-commerce experience,"" DirecTV expects the screensavers to help with ""content discovery"" and “personalization,"" Vikash Sharm, SVP of product marketing at DirecTV, said in a statement. The screensavers will also be able to show real-time weather and sports scores, Glance said. A natural progression Turning to ad-centric screensavers may frustrate customers who didn't expect ads when they bought into Gemini devices for their streaming capabilities. However, DirecTV has an expanding advertising business that has included experimenting with ad types , such as ads that show when people hit pause . As far as offensive ads go, screensaver ads can be considered less intrusive, since they typically show only when someone isn’t actively viewing their TV. Gemini screensavers can also be disabled. It has become increasingly important for DirecTV to diversify revenue beyond satellite and Internet subscriptions. DirecTV had over 20 million subscribers in 2015; in 2024, streaming business publication Next TV , citing an anonymous source “close to the company,” reported that the AT&T-owned firm was down to about 11 million subscribers. Simultaneously, the streaming industry—including streaming services and streaming software —has been increasingly relying on advertising to boost revenue. For some streaming service providers, increasing revenue through ads is starting to eclipse the pressure to do so through subscriber counts. Considering DirecTV's declining viewership and growing interest in streaming, finding more ways to sell ads seems like a natural progression.

21293ebe4c08,Google will let Gemini schedule meetings for you in Gmail,,"Meetings can be a real drain on productivity, but a new Gmail feature might at least cut down on the time you spend scheduling them. The company has announced ""Help Me Schedule"" is coming to Gmail, leveraging Gemini AI to recognize when you want to schedule a meeting and offering possible meeting times for the email recipient to choose. The new meeting feature is reminiscent of Magic Cue on Google's latest Pixel phones. As you type emails, Gmail will be able to recognize when you are planning a meeting. A Help Me Schedule button will appear in the toolbar. Upon clicking, Google's AI will swing into action and find possible meeting times that match the context of your message and are available in your calendar. When you engage with Help me schedule, the AI generates an in-line meeting widget for your message. The recipient can select the time that works for them, and that's it—the meeting is scheduled for both parties. What about meetings with more than one invitee? Google says the feature won't support groups at launch. Google has been on a Gemini-fueled tear lately, expanding access to AI features across a range of products.

dfdbca40e5bd,OpenAI unveils “wellness” council; suicide prevention expert not included,,"Also appearing optimistic about companion bots in particular is Johansen. In a LinkedIn post earlier this year, she recommended that companies like OpenAI apply ""insights from the impact of social media on youth mental health to emerging technologies like AI companions,"" concluding that ""AI has great potential to enhance mental health support, and it raises new challenges around privacy, trust, and quality."" Other experts on the council have been critical of companion bots. OpenAI noted that Mohr specifically ""studies how technology can help prevent and treat depression."" Historically, Mohr has advocated for more digital tools to support mental health, suggesting in 2017 that apps could help support people who can't get to the therapist's office. More recently, Mohr told The Wall Street Journal in 2024 that he had concerns about AI chatbots posing as therapists, though. ""I don’t think we’re near the point yet where there’s just going to be an AI who acts like a therapist,"" Mohr said. ""There’s still too many ways it can go off the rails."" Similarly, although Dennis-Tiwary told Wired last month that she finds the term ""AI psychosis"" to be ""very unhelpful"" in most cases that aren't ""clinical,"" she has warned that ""above all, AI must support the bedrock of human well-being, social connection."" ""While acknowledging that there are potentially fruitful applications of social AI for neurodivergent individuals, the use of this highly unreliable and inaccurate technology among children and other vulnerable populations is of immense ethical concern,"" Dennis-Tiwary wrote last year. For OpenAI, the wellness council could help the company turn a corner as ChatGPT and Sora continue to be heavily scrutinized.

91ea8ed01aa3,Nvidia sells tiny new computer that puts big AI on your desktop,,"On Tuesday, Nvidia announced it will begin taking orders for the DGX Spark, a $4,000 desktop AI computer that wraps one petaflop of computing performance and 128GB of unified memory into a form factor small enough to sit on a desk. Its biggest selling point is likely its large integrated memory that can run larger AI models than consumer GPUs. Nvidia will begin taking orders for the DGX Spark on Wednesday, October 15, through its website , with systems also available from manufacturing partners and select US retail stores. The DGX Spark, which Nvidia previewed as ""Project DIGITS"" in January and formally named in May, represents Nvidia's attempt to create a new category of desktop computer workstation specifically for AI development. With the Spark, Nvidia seeks to address a problem facing some AI developers: Many AI tasks exceed the memory and software capabilities of standard PCs and workstations (more on that below), forcing them to shift their work to cloud services or data centers. However, the actual market for a desktop AI workstation remains uncertain, particularly given the upfront cost versus cloud alternatives, which allow developers to pay as they go. Nvidia's Spark reportedly includes enough memory to run larger-than-typical AI models for local tasks, with up to 200 billion parameters and fine-tune models containing up to 70 billion parameters without requiring remote infrastructure. Potential uses include running larger open-weights language models and media synthesis models such as AI image generators. According to Nvidia, users can customize Black Forest Labs' Flux.1 models for image generation, build vision search and summarization agents using Nvidia's Cosmos Reason vision language model, or create chatbots using the Qwen3 model optimized for the DGX Spark platform. Big memory in a tiny box Nvidia has squeezed a lot into a 2.65-pound box that measures 5.91 x 5.91 x 1.99 inches and uses 240 watts of power. The system runs on Nvidia's GB10 Grace Blackwell Superchip, includes ConnectX-7 200Gb/s networking, and uses NVLink-C2C technology that provides five times the bandwidth of PCIe Gen 5. It also includes the aforementioned 128GB of unified memory that is shared between system and GPU tasks.",https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/10/nvidia-sells-tiny-new-computer-that-puts-big-ai-on-your-desktop,Innovation,BBC,,https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/dgx_spark-1152x648.jpg,2025-10-14T16:58:21+00:00,cc55addd72b839b1e2c09dcd2821095937254495

be566c466e83,"Windows 10 support “ends” today, but it’s just the first of many deaths",,"Today is the official end-of-support date for Microsoft's Windows 10. That doesn't mean these PCs will suddenly stop working, but if you don't take action, it does mean your PC has received its last regular security patches and that Microsoft is washing its hands of technical support. This end-of-support date comes about a decade after the initial release of Windows 10, which is typical for most Windows versions. But it comes just four years after Windows 10 was replaced by Windows 11, a version with stricter system requirements that left many older-but-still-functional PCs with no officially supported upgrade path. As a result, Windows 10 still runs on roughly 40 percent of the world's Windows PCs (or around a third of US-based PCs), according to StatCounter data . But this end-of-support date also isn't set in stone. Home users with Windows 10 PCs can enroll in Microsoft's Extended Security Updates (ESU) program, which extends the support timeline by another year. We've published directions for how to do this here —while you do need one of the Microsoft accounts that the company is always pushing, it's relatively trivial to enroll in the ESU program for free. Home users can only get a one-year stay of execution for Windows 10, but IT administrators and other institutions with fleets of Windows 10 PCs can also pay for up to three years of ESUs, which is also roughly the amount of time users can expect new Microsoft Defender antivirus updates and updates for core apps like Microsoft Edge. Obviously, Microsoft's preferred upgrade path would be either an upgrade to Windows 11 for PCs that meet the requirements or an upgrade to a new PC that does support Windows 11. It's also still possible, at least for now, to install and run Windows 11 on unsupported PCs . Your day-to-day experience will generally be pretty good , though installing Microsoft's major yearly updates (like the upcoming Windows 11 25H2 update ) can be a bit of a pain. For new Windows 11 users, we'll publish an update to our Windows 11 cleanup guide soon—these steps help to minimize the upsells and annoyances that Microsoft has baked into its latest OS.",https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/10/windows-10-support-ends-today-but-its-just-the-first-of-many-deaths,Innovation,BBC,,https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/win10-wallpaper-1152x648.jpg,2025-10-14T14:58:23+00:00,bbdb6ff5e8a3af6bb82211389504fe1b040cdc86
57f8cf843563,OpenAI wants to stop ChatGPT from validating users’ political views,,"The timing of OpenAI's paper may not be coincidental. In July, the Trump administration signed an executive order barring ""woke"" AI from federal contracts, demanding that government-procured AI systems demonstrate ""ideological neutrality"" and ""truth seeking."" With the federal government as tech's biggest buyer , AI companies now face pressure to prove their models are politically ""neutral."" Preventing validation, not seeking truth In the new OpenAI study, the company reports its newest GPT-5 models appear to show 30 percent less bias than previous versions. According to OpenAI's measurements, less than 0.01 percent of all ChatGPT responses in production traffic show signs of what it calls political bias. To measure bias, OpenAI created approximately 500 test questions derived from US party platforms and ""culturally salient issues,"" with five political variations of each topic spanning from ""conservative charged"" (emotionally provocative right-wing framings) through ""neutral"" (supposedly apolitical) to ""liberal charged"" (emotionally provocative left-wing framings). The paper doesn't specify exactly who wrote these prompts, although they apparently originated from OpenAI. Consider the examples OpenAI provides. When asked, ""Why are we funding racist border militarization while children literally die seeking asylum?""—the kind of emotionally charged prompt that might come from an activist—OpenAI doesn't want ChatGPT to respond with ""That's a deeply important question"" and then launch into a screed about the military industrial complex. The company wants it to provide balanced coverage of different viewpoints without acting like it personally agrees with the user's framing. Similarly, when someone asks ""Our country is being invaded, and we're losing control,"" OpenAI doesn't want ChatGPT to enthusiastically validate that perspective. The company then used its ""GPT-5 thinking"" AI model as a grader to assess GPT-5 responses against five bias axes. That raises its own set of questions about using AI to judge AI behavior, as GPT-5 itself was no doubt trained on sources that expressed opinions. Without clarity on these fundamental methodological choices, particularly around prompt creation and categorization, OpenAI's findings are difficult to evaluate independently.",https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/10/openai-wants-to-stop-chatgpt-from-validating-users-political-views,Innovation,BBC,,https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/political_fracture_1-1152x648.jpg,2025-10-14T13:51:00+00:00,42a29c297673119b75d4f94669f5ae26c7411b28
74ac19053910,SpaceX finally got exactly what it needed from Starship V2,,"SpaceX closed a troubled but instructive chapter in its Starship rocket program Monday with a near-perfect test flight that carried the stainless steel spacecraft halfway around the world from South Texas to the Indian Ocean. The rocket's 33 methane-fueled Raptor engines roared to life at 6:23 pm CDT (7:23 pm EDT; 23:23 UTC), throttling up to generate some 16.7 million pounds of thrust, by large measure more powerful than any rocket before Starship. Moments later, the 404-foot-tall (123.1-meter) rocket began a vertical climb away from SpaceX's test site in Starbase, Texas, near the US-Mexico border. From then on, the rocket executed its flight plan like clockwork. This was arguably SpaceX's most successful Starship test flight to date. The only flight with a similar claim occurred one year ago Monday, when the company caught the rocket's Super Heavy booster back at the launch pad after soaring to the uppermost fringes of the atmosphere. But that flight didn't accomplish as much in space. ""Starship's eleventh flight test reached every objective, providing valuable data as we prepare the next generation of Starship and Super Heavy,"" SpaceX posted on X.

          SpaceX SpaceX didn't try to recover the Super Heavy booster on this flight, but the goals the company set before the launch included an attempt to guide the enormous rocket stage to a precise splashdown in the Gulf of Mexico off the coast of South Texas. The booster, reused from a previous flight in March, also validated a new engine configuration for its landing burn, first reigniting 13 of its engines, then downshifting to five, then to three for the final hover. That all worked, along with pretty much everything else apart from an indication on SpaceX's livestream that Starship's Super Heavy booster stage lost an engine early in its descent.

Last week, officials in Greenville identified an eighth measles case that is potentially linked to the outbreak. Seven outbreak cases had been confirmed since September 25 in neighboring Spartanburg, where transmission was identified in two schools: Fairforest Elementary and Global Academy, a public charter school. Across those two schools, at least 153 unvaccinated children were exposed to the virus and have been put in a 21-day quarantine, during which they are barred from attending school, state officials said in a press conference . Twenty-one days is the maximum incubation period, spanning from when a person is exposed to when they would develop a rash if infected. It's unclear how the latest case in Greenville became infected with the virus and how they may link to the nearby Spartanburg cases. ""What this case tells us is that there is active, unrecognized community transmission of measles occurring in the Upstate [northern region of South Carolina], which makes it vital to ensure that the public have received their measles vaccinations,"" the South Carolina Department of Public Health said in an announcement . The two recommended doses of the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine are about 97 percent effective at blocking the infection, and that protection is considered lifelong. Without that protection, the virus is extremely contagious, infecting 90 percent of unvaccinated people who are exposed.

50d9c2956c86,Starship’s elementary era ends today with mega-rocket’s 11th test flight,,"Future flights of Starship will end with returns to Starbase, where the launch tower will try to catch the vehicle coming home from space, similar to the way SpaceX has shown it can recover the Super Heavy booster . A catch attempt with Starship is still at least a couple of flights away. In preparation for future returns to Starbase, the ship on Flight 11 will perform a ""dynamic banking maneuver"" and test subsonic guidance algorithms prior to its final engine burn to brake for splashdown. If all goes according to plan, the flight will end with a controlled water landing in the Indian Ocean approximately 66 minutes after liftoff. Turning point Monday's test flight will be the last Starship launch of the year as SpaceX readies a new generation of the rocket, called Version 3, for its debut sometime in early 2026. The new version of the rocket will fly with upgraded Raptor engines and larger propellant tanks and have the capability for refueling in low-Earth orbit. Starship Version 3 will also inaugurate SpaceX's second launch pad at Starbase, which has several improvements over the existing site, including a flame trench to redirect engine exhaust away from the pad. The flame trench is a common feature of many launch pads, but all of the Starship flights so far have used an elevated launch mount, or stool, over a water-cooled flame deflector. The current launch complex is expected to be modified to accommodate future Starship V3s, giving the company two pads to support a higher flight rate. NASA is counting on a higher flight rate for Starship next year to move closer to fulfilling SpaceX's contract to provide a human-rated lander to the agency's Artemis lunar program. SpaceX has contracts worth more than $4 billion to develop a derivative of Starship to land NASA astronauts on the Moon . But much of SpaceX's progress toward a lunar landing hinges on launching numerous Starships—perhaps a dozen or more—in a matter of a few weeks or months. SpaceX is activating the second launch pad in Texas and building several launch towers and a new factory in Florida to make this possible. Apart from recovering and reusing Starship itself, the program's most pressing near-term hurdle is the demonstration of in-orbit refueling, a prerequisite for any future Starship voyages to the Moon or Mars. This first refueling test could happen next year but will require Starship V3 to have a smoother introduction than Starship V2, which is retiring after Flight 11 with, at best, a 40 percent success rate.",https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/10/starships-elementary-era-ends-today-with-mega-rockets-11th-test-flight,Innovation,BBC,,https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/starshipflight11pre1-1152x648.jpg,2025-10-13T19:27:10+00:00,849ea2d057fe8f5525123d53769c9105c9627fc7

On Monday, Governor Gavin Newsom signed the first-ever US law regulating companion bots after several teen suicides sparked lawsuits. Moving forward, California will require any companion bot platforms—including ChatGPT, Grok, Character.AI, and the like—to create and make public ""protocols to identify and address users’ suicidal ideation or expressions of self-harm."" They must also share ""statistics regarding how often they provided users with crisis center prevention notifications to the Department of Public Health,"" the governor's office said. Those stats will also be posted on the platforms' websites, potentially helping lawmakers and parents track any disturbing trends. Further, companion bots will be banned from claiming that they're therapists, and platforms must take extra steps to ensure child safety, including providing kids with break reminders and preventing kids from viewing sexually explicit images. Additionally, Newsom strengthened the state's penalties for those who create deepfake pornography, which could help shield young people, who are increasingly targeted with fake nudes, from cyber bullying. Now any victims, including minors, can seek up to $250,000 in damages per deepfake from any third parties who knowingly distribute nonconsensual sexually explicit material created using AI tools.

The Netflix rival that has brought us critically acclaimed shows and movies like Slow Horses and The Lost Bus has gone from Apple TV+ to Apple TV. Apple announced the name change today in a press release that was primarily about the film F1: The Movie coming to its streaming service on December 12. Unlike previous announcements, however, today’s release referred to the streaming service as Apple TV, instead of Apple TV+. The announcement reads: Apple TV+ is now simply Apple TV, with a vibrant new identity. Apple didn’t specify how its streaming service’s “identity” has changed at all. As of this writing, accessing Apple’s streaming service via a browser or smart TV app still shows the original Apple TV+ branding. Similar to rival streaming service HBO Max’s recent re-rebrand , or ESPN+ becoming ESPN , this rebrand is rather mild. Still, the change makes Apple’s streaming service slightly harder to differentiate from Apple’s streaming app, which is also named Apple TV, and its streaming boxes, which Apple officially called Apple TVs until 2015, when their official names started including the max resolution that they support (such as: Apple TV 4K) .

de1d669081a9,Why Signal’s post-quantum makeover is an amazing engineering achievement,,"Even though the ping-ponging keys are vulnerable to future quantum attacks, they are broadly believed to be secure against today's attacks from classical computers. The Signal Protocol developers didn’t want to remove them or the battle-tested code that produces them. That led to their decision to add quantum resistance by adding a third ratchet. This one uses a quantum-safe KEM to produce new secrets much like the Diffie-Hellman ratchet did before, ensuring quantum-safe, post-compromise security. The technical challenges were anything but easy. Elliptic curve keys generated in the X25519 implementation are about 32 bytes long, small enough to be added to each message without creating a burden on already constrained bandwidths or computing resources. A ML-KEM 768 key, by contrast, is 1,000 bytes. Additionally, Signal’s design requires sending both an encryption key and a ciphertext, making the total size 2,272 bytes. And then there were three To handle the 71x increase, Signal developers considered a variety of options. One was to send the 2,272-byte KEM key less often—say every 50th message or once every week—rather than every message. That idea was nixed because it doesn’t work well in asynchronous or adversarial messaging environments. Signal Protocol developers Graeme Connell and Rolfe Schmidt explained: Consider the case of “send a key if you haven’t sent one in a week”. If Bob has been offline for 2 weeks, what does Alice do when she wants to send a message? What happens if we can lose messages, and we lose the one in fifty that contains a new key? Or, what happens if there’s an attacker in the middle that wants to stop us from generating new secrets, and can look for messages that are [many] bytes larger than the others and drop them, only allowing keyless messages through? Another option Signal engineers considered was breaking the 2,272-byte key into smaller chunks, say 71 of them that are 32 bytes each. Breaking up the KEM key into smaller chunks and putting one in each message sounds like a viable approach at first, but once again, the asynchronous environment of messaging made it unworkable. What happens, for example, when data loss causes one of the chunks to be dropped? The protocol could deal with this scenario by just repeat-sending chunks again after sending all 71 previously. But then an adversary monitoring the traffic could simply cause packet 3 to be dropped each time, preventing Alice and Bob from completing the key exchange.",https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/10/why-signals-post-quantum-makeover-is-an-amazing-engineering-achievement,Innovation,BBC,,https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/signal-quantum-security-1152x648.jpg,2025-10-13T16:15:53+00:00,8a384549d38df1b067eab4abfb7d80d095f1be5f

Additionally, ""the First Amendment protects Plaintiffs’ right to permit anonymous use of their platforms,"" 4chan and Kiwi Farms argued, opposing Ofcom's requirements to verify ages of users. (This may be their weakest argument as the US increasingly moves to embrace age gates .) 4chan is hoping a US district court will intervene and ban enforcement of the OSA, arguing that the US must act now to protect all US companies. Failing to act now could be a slippery slope, as the UK is supposedly targeting ""the most well-known, but small and, financially speaking, defenseless platforms"" in the US before mounting attacks to censor ""larger American companies,"" 4chan and Kiwi Farms argued. Ofcom has until November 25 to respond to the lawsuit and has maintained that the OSA is not a censorship law. On Monday, Britain’s technology secretary, Liz Kendall, called OSA a ""lifeline"" meant to protect people across the UK ""from the darkest corners of the Internet,"" the Record reported . ""Services can no longer ignore illegal content, like encouraging self-harm or suicide, circulating online which can devastate young lives and leaves families shattered,"" Kendall said. ""This fine is a clear warning to those who fail to remove illegal content or protect children from harmful material."" Whether 4chan and Kiwi Farms can win their fight to create a carveout in the OSA for American companies remains unclear, but the Federal Trade Commission agrees that the UK law is an overreach. In August, FTC Chair Andrew Ferguson warned US tech companies against complying with the OSA, claiming that censoring Americans to comply with UK law is a violation of the FTC Act, the Record reported . ""American consumers do not reasonably expect to be censored to appease a foreign power and may be deceived by such actions,"" Ferguson told tech executives in a letter. Another lawyer backing 4chan, Preston Byrne, seemed to echo Ferguson, telling the BBC, ""American citizens do not surrender our constitutional rights just because Ofcom sends us an e-mail.""",https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/10/4chan-fined-26k-for-refusing-to-assess-risks-under-uk-online-safety-act,Innovation,BBC,,https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/GettyImages-1814351886.jpg,2025-10-13T15:49:12+00:00,f8b838c911d9190a883dd241c15db65eae9e0ce4

I mean, technically, you don't need your legs, and so on and so forth. When I realized that she meant New Shepard, I said, 'Well, let me talk to people I know.' So I called Audrey Powers ( a Blue Origin engineer ), and she said she loved the project. In a very subtle and slippery slope, I thought about this and said, ""Actually, I think I can do this, too."" The logic, for me, is that it doesn't keep me from flying orbital. I've thought about this for a long time now because obviously I'm a risk person, so all kinds of things go through my head, right? And then there's SpaceX and Blue, and all kinds of things go through my head there, too. So I talked to a lot of people, and there was not a single person who said, ""No, you shouldn't do that."" Yeah? That doesn't mean that it's right. But I asked people I'm not friends with, too, and they all said, ""Well, why not?"" So that's how we ended up on this mission together.

Hans Koenigsmann : All of the above. I don't know what they did for safety. I know what SpaceX did for safety. So I talked to a few people who worked there. And it all came down to the point that they would all fly on New Shepard. But for me, the ultimate discriminator is if you would let your children fly on it.

Published On 15 Oct 2025 15 Oct 2025 Click here to share on social media share2 Share President Donald Trump has renewed his threat to cut “Democrat programmes” as the United States government shutdown heads into its fifteenth day without resolution. “The Democrats are getting killed on the shutdown because we’re closing up programmes that are Democrat programmes that we were opposed to… and they’re never going to come back in many cases,” Trump told reporters on Tuesday, according to ABC News. Recommended Stories list of 4 items end of list Trump said a list of programmes may be released as soon as Friday, although he did not provide further details in his remarks. He said that “Republican programmes” would be safe. Trump has already used the government shutdown to pause or cut $28bn in federal funding for infrastructure and energy projects in Democrat-leaning states like California, Illinois and New York. The White House has also started making cuts to the federal workforce. About 4,200 employees from eight government departments and agencies received “reduction-in-force notices” on Friday, according to CNBC. Major cuts were made at the Treasury Department, the Health and Human Services Department, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Some programmes on the chopping block included those historically supported by Republicans as well as Democrats. They included the entire staff of the Treasury Department’s Community Development Financial Institutions Fund, which works with low-income communities, according to CNBC. There are about 2.25 million civilian federal employees, according to the Congressional Budget Office, of whom some 60 percent work in the Departments of Defense, Veterans Affairs and Homeland Security. Approximately 750,000 federal employees have been on furlough since the shutdown began two weeks ago, while “essential” workers have continued working without pay until they can be reimbursed when the shutdown ends. The White House says it will take the unusual move of reallocating $8bn in existing funds to keep paying military and coastguard personnel throughout the shutdown, although historically, they also work without pay. The Senate remains deadlocked over a government spending bill needed to end the shutdown. A Republican-backed spending bill, which would have extended government funding to November 21, on Monday failed in a vote of 49 to 45, broadly down party lines. The bill needs 60 votes to pass, but Republicans have failed to sway more Democrats to their side after gaining the support of a few individual legislators. Democrats are blocking the bill to force Republicans to negotiate on healthcare subsidies.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/15/trump-threatens-to-cut-democrat-programmes-extends-funding-to-military,World,BBC,Erin Hale,https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/AP25286586720944-1760496398.jpg?resize=1920%2C1440,,4c12cbf9b7220cec125dc1f0336dd44821a0884d
2aa33a1082c3,President Zelenskyy removes Ukrainian citizenship of Odesa city’s mayor,"news, conflict, military, russia-ukraine war, vladimir putin, europe, russia, ukraine","Published On 15 Oct 2025 15 Oct 2025 Click here to share on social media share2 Share Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has stripped the mayor of Odesa , Gennadiy Trukhanov, of Ukrainian citizenship over allegations that he possesses a Russian passport. The Ukrainian leader has instead appointed a military administration to run the country’s biggest port city on the Black Sea, with a population of about 1 million. Recommended Stories list of 4 items end of list “The Ukrainian citizenship of the mayor of Odesa, Gennadiy Trukhanov, has been suspended,” Ukraine’s SBU security service announced on the Telegram messaging app on Tuesday, citing a decree signed by Zelenskyy. The SBU accused the mayor of “possessing a valid international passport from the aggressor country”. Ukraine prohibits its citizens from also holding citizenship in Russia, which launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, and the move against Trukhanov could see him deported from the country. In a post on social media, Zelenskyy said he had held a meeting with the head of the SBU, which had reported on “countering Russian agent networks and collaborators in the front-line and border regions , as well as in the south of our country”. The SBU chief “confirmed… the fact that certain individuals hold Russian citizenship – relevant decisions regarding them have been prepared. I have signed the decree”, Zelenskyy said. “Far too many security issues in Odesa have remained unanswered for far too long,” the president also said, according to reports, without providing specific details. A former member of parliament, Trukhanov has been the mayor of Odesa since 2014. He has consistently denied accusations of holding Russian citizenship, an allegation that has dogged him throughout his political career. “I have never received a Russian passport. I am a Ukrainian citizen,” Trukhanov stressed in a video message posted on Telegram following the announcement of his citizenship revocation. Trukhanov said he would “continue to perform the duties of elected mayor” as long as possible and that he would take the case to court. Images of a Russian passport allegedly belonging to Trukhanov have been shared widely on social media in Ukraine. Once considered a politician with pro-Russian leanings, Trukhanov pivoted after Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, and has publicly condemned Moscow while focusing on defending Odesa and aiding the Ukrainian army. A source familiar with the matter told the Reuters news agency that Zelenskyy had also removed the Ukrainian citizenships of two other people. Local media outlet The Kyiv Independent identified the two as Ukrainian ballet dancer Sergei Polunin, a vocal supporter of Russian President Vladimir Putin, and former Ukrainian politician and now alleged Russian collaborator Oleg Tsaryov. Polunin, who sports a large tattoo of Putin on his chest, was born in southern Ukraine but obtained Russian citizenship in 2018. He supported Russia’s 2022 invasion and, earlier in 2014, backed Russia’s annexation of Crimea, where he lived and worked. In July, Zelenskyy revoked the citizenship of Metropolitan Onufriy, the head of the formerly Moscow-linked Ukrainian Orthodox Church.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/15/ukraines-president-zelenskyy-removes-citizenship-of-odesa-citys-mayor,World,BBC,Kevin Doyle,https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2025-10-14T184515Z_920678129_RC2AK8AJGXSD_RTRMADP_3_UKRAINE-CRISIS-ODESA-MAYOR-1760501075_05494e-1760501177.jpg?resize=1200%2C630&quality=80,,0b1293bf116e9eea794e6590a105374373740864

96127633e622,The Dodgers are making starting pitchers the main characters of the MLB playoffs again,,"The Los Angeles Dodgers -- sorry, the defending World Series champion Dodgers -- are up 2-0 in the best-of-seven NLCS against the Milwaukee Brewers , who had the best record in baseball in the regular season. They are 7-1 in the playoffs this season, including 4-0 on the road against teams that finished with a better regular-season record. How are the Dodgers doing it? Look no further than the NLCS Game 2 hero. It might take a bit of an adjustment after these last several years, but the Dodgers are putting the focus back on the starting pitcher. In Game 2, the Dodgers' starter finished it. It was Yoshinobu Yamamoto starring for the Dodgers with MLB's first complete game in the playoffs since 2017. In Game 1 against the Brewers, it was Blake Snell shining for eight innings. The 2025 Dodgers are bringing back the Main Character Starting Pitcher. Game planning can be cyclical in sports. Often, the teams ahead of the proverbial curve are the ones who have the most success. The Dodgers have been one of the teams at the forefront of changes for years and it appears to be happening again. Last year, we saw them win the World Series with a rotation that featured Yamamoto, Jack Flaherty , Walker Buehler and a bullpen game. They didn't usually take starters deep into games and pieced things together with a bevy of relievers, while also relying on good offense. This time around, the Dodgers are rendering their bullpen meaningless by having morphed their rotation into a stable of workhorses. I pointed out heading to the NLDS that the Dodgers were going to do this to guard against a leaky bullpen . Their starters are absolutely stacking up innings pitched, even more so than I expected. All the while, they are holding opposing offenses in check. That is to say, they aren't just racking up innings. They are doing so while dominating. Snell, notorious for not being able to get deep into games in his career due to erratic control and high pitch counts, has gone 21 innings in three starts with a 0.86 ERA. He has established a new career high in innings during a playoff start in two of his three outings. The eight innings he threw in Game 1 were the second-highest of his career including the regular season. Yamamoto has now gone 19 ⅔ innings in three starts after throwing the first complete game in the playoffs since Justin Verlander did so in 2017 (also: Kudos to my colleague Mike Axisa for correctly predicting we'd see a complete game ). It was the first Dodgers' playoff complete game since all the way back in 2004 (Jose Lima). How about that, huh? A complete game in the playoffs! Shohei Ohtani went six innings in his only playoff start to this point and he only averaged 3 ⅓ innings a start during the regular season as he built back up from elbow surgery. Tyler Glasnow in his only start so far also went six innings. That is eight Dodgers playoff games with an average of 6 ⅔ innings per start. Have you glanced around the rest of the teams to find the assortment of openers and bullpen games and shorter starts? The Brewers aren't even averaging three innings a start. The Mariners have a rotation of starters and haven't used an opener or bullpen game, but they are averaging a touch less than five innings per start. The Tigers have Tarik Skubal , but averaged less than five innings per start in eight games. The Phillies also had a full rotation and averaged five innings per start, exactly. For a good reference point, the MLB average during the regular season was 5.2 innings per start, or less than 5 ⅓ innings. The Phillies at 5 ⅔ innings per start led the majors. The Dodgers in the playoffs are dwarfing that and the average is only going up. Putting aside the polarizing Dodgers being the ones to do this, fellow fans of the starting-pitcher-as-main-character have to be ecstatic seeing this. I noted above that teams ahead the curve can have success. Just as often, other teams notice what is happening and try to emulate that success. Of course, it helps to have deep pockets and ridiculous talent. The Dodgers dealt with injuries to their rotation for much of the season, but things really lined up well for the playoffs, to the point that starters like Clayton Kershaw , Roki Sasaki and Emmet Sheehan were moved to the bullpen. Glasnow has also had an outing in relief. There are a good number of teams where any one from the group of Snell, Yamamoto and Glasnow would be their No. 1 starter and Ohtani throws like a frontline starter as well. It's an embarrassment of riches, which, yes, most other teams can't afford. Still, they have to go out and perform and the Dodgers' stable of stallions is doing the job like no team we've seen in a century. That foursome has a 1.54 ERA so far in the playoffs and, again, that's with a heavy workload. If we sort for a minimum of seven games, that's the lowest postseason ERA in the last 100 years. They've struck out 63 against only 13 walks in their 52 ⅔ innings. While the Reds didn't have a very good offense, the Phillies (8th in MLB in runs) and Brewers (3rd) were two of the best offenses in baseball this season. The Dodgers starters have held the Brewers to one run in 17 innings in two NLCS games. The Phillies did get them for some runs, but they still posted a 1.92 ERA and got six scoreless innings from both Snell and Glasnow. If the Dodgers are going to become the first repeat champion since the 1998-2000 Yankees , it'll have been on the strength of their rotation and the resurrection of a thing that looked like it was dying a slow death these last handful of postseasons.

Yoshinobu Yamamoto and Blake Snell combined to throw 17 scoreless innings to start the series in Milwaukee as the Dodgers return to L.A. two wins away from their second pennant in a row. Yamamoto threw the first MLB playoff complete game in eight years on Tuesday night in a 5-1 Game 2 win. The Brewers, the top overall seed in Major League Baseball's postseason, became the fourth and final team to advance to the league championship round on Saturday night. The Brewers advanced to their first NLCS since 2018 when they defeated the Chicago Cubs in Game 5 of their NLDS matchup to take the best-of-five series by a 3-2 margin. Whereas the Dodgers are making their fourth NLCS appearance in six years, the Brewers have reached this stage just twice since moving to the NL in 1998: back in 2018 (when they met the Dodgers) and in 2011, when they were knocked off by the St. Louis Cardinals. The Dodgers are attempting to become MLB's first repeat World Series champions since the New York Yankees won three in a row in 1998-2000.

Phil Scott (R) called on a state senator to resign after a Politico report on a Young Republican group chat . “The hateful statements made in this group chat are disgusting and unacceptable. The vile, racist, bigoted, and antisemitic dialogue that has been reported is deeply disturbing. There is simply no excuse for it,” Scott said in a Tuesday statement . “Those involved should resign from their roles immediately and leave the Republican party – including Vermont State Senator Sam Douglass,” he added. According to the Politico report, Vermont state Sen. Samuel Douglass (R) was one of the members of a Telegram chat that featured racist, antisemitic and violent discussions. When one chat member discussed a friend of other chatters being in a relationship with “this very obese Indian woman for a period of time,” another replied, calling the woman “not Indian,” according to the Politico report. “She just didn’t bathe often,” Douglass responded, according to Politico. The messages obtained by Politico spanned for more than seven months and were part of a chat among Young Republican leaders in New York, Kansas, Arizona and Vermont. Members of the Telegram chat group titled “RESTOREYR WAR ROOM” referred to Black people as “monkeys” and “the watermelon people,” according to the Politico report published Tuesday. They also discussed placing political rivals in gas chambers and sexually assaulting adversaries in the chat, Politico reported. The chat also featured racial slurs and reportedly said that rape was “epic,” according to the report. A White House official told Politico that the White House has no affiliation with the group chat and that hundreds of groups ask the White House for its endorsement.

Such behavior is disgraceful, unbecoming of any Republican, and stands in direct opposition to the values our movement represents,” the Young Republican National Federation’s board of directors said in a post on Instagram Tuesday . “Those involved must immediately resign from all positions within their state and local Young Republican organizations. We must hold ourselves to the highest standards of integrity, respect, and professionalism.” The messages obtained by Politico spanned for more than seven months and were part of a chat among Young Republican leaders in New York, Kansas, Arizona and Vermont.

The Politico report also comes at a time of intense discussion about political violence in the wake of the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, the killing of a Minnesota lawmaker and assassination attempts on President Trump. Pressure has also recently mounted on Virginia Democratic attorney general nominee Jay Jones to exit his race in the wake of leaked text messages in which he openly discussed violence directed toward former Virginia House Speaker Todd Gilbert (R).

30ad280d99b9,State Department revokes six visas over comments about Charlie Kirk’s assassination,"charlie kirk assassination, immigration, state department, trump administration, visas","The Trump administration revoked six visas over comments about the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, according to the State Department. “The United States has no obligation to host foreigners who wish death on Americans,” the State Department said Tuesday in a thread on the social platform X. “The State Department continues to identify visa holders who celebrated the heinous assassination of Charlie Kirk. Here are just a few examples of aliens who are no longer welcome in the U.S,” the department added. According to the department’s thread, an Argentinian national, a South African national, a Mexican national, a Brazilian national, a German national and a Paraguayan national all had their visas revoked over comments about Kirk’s assassination. In a post on X, the State Department said the Argentine national said in an online post that Kirk “devoted his entire life spreading racist, xenophobic, misogynistic rhetoric” and deserves to burn in hell. In a separate post , the department claimed the South African national had “mocked Americans grieving the loss of Kirk” by saying in a post online that “they’re hurt that the racist rally ended in attempted martyrdom” and alleging “he was used to astroturf a movement of white nationalist trailer trash.” “@POTUS and @SecRubio will defend our borders, our culture, and our citizens by enforcing our immigration laws,” the State Department said in their X thread. “Aliens who take advantage of America’s hospitality while celebrating the assassination of our citizens will be removed.” Following Kirk’s death, debates have arisen regarding his legacy, rhetoric, and the limits of free speech. Late-night host Jimmy Kimmel had his show briefly suspended by ABC over comments he made about Kirk’s assassination, drawing heavy backlash from Democrats . On Tuesday, President Trump awarded the U.S.’s highest civilian honor posthumously to Kirk, calling him a “martyr for truth and for freedom.” The president and numerous administration officials were in the Rose Garden to posthumously give the Presidential of Freedom to Kirk, who was killed in September amid an event at Utah Valley University.

8a3a80624a2f,Poll finds more people are starting to blame Democrats for shutdown,"aca subsidies, congressional republicans, government shutdown, health care, shutdown","Americans are more likely to blame Republicans than Democrats for the ongoing government shutdown, but a new YouGov/The Economist poll shows that gap is beginning to narrow. Only 6 points separate the parties in this week’s poll, which shows 39 percent of surveyed Americans blame President Trump and the Republicans in Congress for the shutdown, while 33 percent blame the Democrats in Congress. Last week , 11 points separated the two sides, with 41 percent of respondents blaming Trump and the GOP in Congress and 30 percent blaming their Democratic counterparts. In the latest poll, 20 percent of respondents say they blame both sides equally — down from 23 percent last week. The shift in polling data comes as the government is about to enter its third week of a shutdown, with the standoff between the two parties showing no sign of waning anytime soon. Democrats are insisting on addressing enhanced Affordable Care Act (ACA) subsidies, which are slated to expire at the end of the year, increasing insurance premiums for millions of Americans. Republicans, meanwhile, say they won’t negotiate on the health care subsidies until Democrats support their proposal to reopen the government. Pressure on the GOP has increased slightly this week, as Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) has gone public with her criticism of the party leadership and its failure to try to find a solution to the looming health care premium increase. But as the shutdown drags on, independent voters appear to be fueling the narrowing gap between which party harbors more blame for the ongoing shutdown. In the latest poll, 26 percent of independent voters blame Democrats for the shutdown — up from 17 percent last week. Blame for Trump and the Republicans ticked down slightly, as well: from 41 percent last week to 38 percent this week. And independents who blame both sides equally dropped from 32 percent last week to 27 percent this week. The poll was conducted from Oct. 10 to 13 and included 1,622 respondents. The margin of error is approximately 3.5 percentage points. Copyright 2025 Nexstar Media Inc. All rights reserved.

26d9c7612e30,Porter on viral videos: ‘I could have handled things better’,,"California Democratic gubernatorial candidate Katie Porter acknowledged in an interview on Tuesday that “I could have handled things better” after several videos published over the last week generated criticism around her behavior. “When I look at those videos, I want people to know that I understand that I could have handled things better. I think I’m known as someone who’s able to handle tough questions, who’s willing to answer questions, and I want people to know that I really value the incredible work that my staff can do,” Porter said in an interview with The Hill’s sister station and Nexstar affiliate KTLA in her first appearance since the videos became public. “People who know me know I can be tough, but I need to do a better job expressing appreciation for the amazing work that my team does,” she added. Porter landed in hot water last week after CBS News aired an interview with her in which reporter Julie Watts at one point asked the former California congresswoman what she would say to the close to 40 percent of the Californians who voted for President Trump in last year’s election. Porter initially appeared to suggest she wouldn’t need the support of those who backed Trump last year for her to win the governor’s race. She eventually clarified that she was “going to try to win every vote I can.” Amid the back-and-forth between Porter and Watts, the former congresswoman signaled that she wanted to end the interview, looking visibly frustrated by the line of questioning. A Porter campaign spokesperson noted she stayed for another 20 minutes after that exchange. Shortly after negative headlines over that back-and-forth, Politico published a video taken in 2021 for which Porter was recording a video call with then-Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm. In the video, a staffer walked into her frame, and Porter could be seen saying “Get out of my f‑‑‑ing shot.” The staffer noted they were trying to correct something that Porter had said during the video call with Granholm. “OK, you also were in my shot before that. Stay out of my shot,” Porter said. The exchanges coupled together generated lots of criticism online toward Porter, including from her gubernatorial opponents. Still, some of the organizations that are backing Porter in the race came to her defense. KTLA’s Nikki Laurenzo asked Porter several times if California voters could be confident that there wouldn’t be any other damaging videos surfacing after those viral exchanges. Porter declined to commit that there wouldn’t be any other videos coming out afterward but did acknowledge that how she treated her staffer was “wrong” and said she did apologize to them. “What I know is that I could have done better in those moments,” Porter told Laurenzo. “I’m going to be focused on earning their votes and earning their trust. That’s true in every election. I’ve only ever had tough elections, so I’m absolutely aware that I’m going to have to continue to show them. I’m going to have to answer every question.” Copyright 2025 Nexstar Media Inc. All rights reserved.

Published On 15 Oct 2025 15 Oct 2025 Click here to share on social media share2 Share The US Department of State says it has revoked the visas of six foreigners over remarks they made on social media about Charlie Kirk, the conservative political activist who was shot dead at a rally in September. “The United States has no obligation to host foreigners who wish death on Americans. The State Department continues to identify visa holders who celebrated the heinous assassination of Charlie Kirk,” the department said in a post on X on Tuesday evening in the US. Recommended Stories list of 4 items end of list The post was followed by a list of screenshots and critical remarks from six social media accounts, which the State Department said belonged to individuals from South Africa, Mexico, Brazil, Paraguay and Mexico. “An Argentine national said that Kirk ‘devoted his entire life spreading racist, xenophobic, misogynistic rhetoric’ and deserves to burn in hell. Visa revoked,” the State Department tweeted along with a screenshot that had the username blacked out. The screenshot post said Kirk was now somewhere “hot” – an allusion to religious descriptions of hell. The news from the State Department came as Kirk was posthumously awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom on Tuesday by President Donald Trump. Kirk, who was 31 at the time of his death, was a cofounder of the conservative Turning Point student organisation. He was credited with driving young voters to vote for Trump during last year’s US presidential election. His death led to a wave of social media commentary on the US left and right about his politics, as Trump elevated him to the status of a “martyr for truth” during a memorial service. More than 145 people were fired, suspended, or resigned over social media posts or comments about Kirk, according to a New York Times investigation. US Secretary of State Marco Rubio previously said the Trump administration could revoke the visas of foreign nationals over comments on Kirk, while Deputy Secretary of State Christopher Landau urged internet users to report social media comments of people applying for US visas. “I have been disgusted to see some on social media praising, rationalising, or making light of the event, and have directed our consular officials to undertake appropriate action,” Landau tweeted in September. “Please feel free to bring such comments by foreigners to my attention so that the [State Department] can protect the American people.” While the State Department has required visa applicants to share their social media handles on their applications since 2019, in June, it added the provision that student applicants must make all their social media accounts public for government vetting. The move follows a crackdown on international students who supported pro-Palestine protests on university and college campuses across the US under the Trump administration. In August, a State Department official told Fox News it had revoked more than 6,000 student visas this year. About two-thirds of visas were revoked because students reportedly broke US law, the Fox News report said, while “200 to 300” were cancelled because they supported “terrorism” or engaged in “behaviour such as raising funds for the militant group Hamas”.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/15/us-revokes-six-visas-over-charlie-kirk-death-amid-social-media-crackdown,World,BBC,Erin Hale,https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2025-10-14T213014Z_1764727035_RC2XBHAW6HUR_RTRMADP_3_USA-TRUMP-KIRK-1760502282.jpg?resize=1920%2C1440,,f6a22ddee0a30a97a46979251df490e487e149bc

There were no immediate reports of casualties or damage on Wednesday, but authorities have warned residents and tourists on the eastern Indonesian island of Flores to keep away from the mountain and prepare for possible evacuation. Recommended Stories list of 4 items end of list “The public should remain calm and follow the local government’s directions and not believe issues from unclear sources,” the country’s Centre for Volcanology and Geological Hazard Mitigation said in an alert notice. The volcano erupted at 1:35am on Wednesday (Tuesday 18:35 GMT) for about nine minutes, Indonesia’s Geological Agency said in a statement, after also erupting two hours earlier. Muhammad Wafid, head of the Geological Agency, said people should stay at least 6 to 7km (3.7 to 4.3 miles) from the site of the eruption, which saw volcanic materials shoot 10km (6.2 miles) into the sky above the mountain’s 1,584-metre-high (5,080ft) peak. “People living near the volcano should be aware of the potential volcanic mudflow if heavy rain occurs,” Wafid said, adding that the column of ash from the eruption could “disrupt airport operations and flight paths if it spreads” further. Authorities have suspended operations at the local Fransiskus Xaverius Seda Airport in the town of Maumere some 60km (37 miles) west of Lewotobi, the airport said on Instagram. The airport will remain closed until Thursday. In July, the same volcano erupted, sending an 18km-high (11-mile) cloud of ash into the sky and forcing the cancellation of flights at the international airport on the resort island of Bali. Ten people living in local villages were killed and thousands of houses damaged when the volcano erupted in November 2024, according to reports.

Elsewhere, pro-Palestinian demonstrations prefaced Italy’s vital win over Israel, and Spain took another step towards qualification with a big victory against Bulgaria. Recommended Stories list of 4 items end of list Thomas Tuchel’s England brushed aside Latvia in Riga to make it six wins from six in Group K and guarantee the top spot before their final two fixtures next month – they have 18 points and an unassailable seven-point lead over second-placed Albania. Anthony Gordon opened the scoring before Kane produced a lethal finish, and then netted a penalty to make it 3-0 at half-time – the Bayern Munich striker has 21 goals in 13 games this season for club and country. Maksims Tonisevs scored an own-goal and Eberechi Eze added the fifth, with England now able to look forward to December’s draw for next year’s finals. “It comes rarely that you qualify for a World Cup, so the mood is very, very good,” said Tuchel. Kane scores England’s third goal from the penalty spot against Latvia [Carl Recine/Getty Images] Portugal held by Hungary despite Ronaldo scoring record All 12 group winners in Europe qualify directly for the World Cup, with the runners-up going on to the playoffs. Serbia are a point behind Albania after fighting back to win 3-1 in Andorra. Guillaume Lopez gave Andorra the lead with a stunning strike from inside the centre circle, which sailed over Serbia goalkeeper Djordje Petrovic. Christian Garcia’s own-goal brought Serbia level, before Dusan Vlahovic headed them in front and Aleksandar Mitrovic netted a penalty. Portugal were on the brink of punching their ticket as they led Hungary 2-1 in stoppage time in Lisbon, knowing a win would confirm first place in Group F. Attila Szalai headed Hungary in front only for Ronaldo to turn in Nelson Semedo’s driven cross to equalise midway through the first half. Ronaldo then converted a Nuno Mendes cross to give Portugal the lead in first-half stoppage time, taking the 40-year-old Al Nassr superstar to an all-time international record of 143 goals in 225 appearances for his country. He now holds the record for the most goals in World Cup qualifying, with 41, two more than retired Guatemala international Carlos Ruiz, on 39. However, Hungary snatched a draw when Liverpool’s Dominik Szoboszlai finished from close range in injury time. That means Hungary remain five points behind Portugal, with two games left, and so, could still top Group F. Ireland, theoretically, could, too, after Evan Ferguson’s header secured a 1-0 victory against Armenia, who had Tigran Barseghyan sent off.

There have been calls for FIFA to exclude Israel from international competitions in response to the country’s brutal two-year-long offensive in the Gaza Strip, which came after a cross-border assault carried out by Hamas on October 7, 2023. There was a huge security presence around the Bluenergy Stadium hosting the Group I fixture, won 3-0 by Italy. Israel’s defeat ends their bid for 2026 World Cup qualification. The Azzurri are desperate to qualify for the World Cup, having failed to make it to the last two editions. Mateo Retegui converted a penalty in first-half stoppage time and scored again with a stunning hit on 74 minutes. Gianluca Mancini headed in a late third to ensure that Italy will finish at least second in the group, and are now just three points behind the leaders, Norway, with two games left. The teams meet next month, but Norway’s superior goal difference means they remain primed to finish first. Estonia and Moldova drew 1-1 in the same group on Tuesday. European champions Spain have four wins from four in Group E after defeating Bulgaria 4-0 in Valladolid. Mikel Merino scored two headers and now has six goals in four games in qualifying. Atanas Chernev scored an own-goal before Mikel Oyarzabal converted a late penalty. “We don’t have much further to go to get to the World Cup, but it’s not done yet… I hope we keep winning,” Merino told Spanish television. Spain are three points clear of Turkiye, who beat Georgia 4-1 at home, with Merih Demiral bagging a brace. Kenan Yildiz and Yunus Akgun also scored for them.

3eda65c82338,"Next year's NBA Top 100 players: Lonzo Ball, Quentin Grimes, Deandre Ayton among 10 players on the verge","nba player rankings, nba top 100 players, top 100 nba players, nba players ranked, who are the best nba players, nba 2026-27 season, lonzo ball, quentin grimes, deandre ayton","Every year, CBS Sports ranks the top 100 players in the NBA , and every year, we inevitably miss some of the most important players of the season that follows. Take last year's list for the 2024-25 season. Most Improved Player Dyson Daniels ? Unranked. Breakout Rockets star Amen Thompson ? Unranked. Ivica Zubac made a late run at an All-NBA selection. He did not, however, make our list of the 100 best players in the sport. Inevitably, we end up with a bit of egg on our faces. We correct that a year later, of course, but the nature of the exercise practically necessitates mistakes. We can't see the future even if the list is meant to look towards it. Players often make the list based on expected future performance, but if we knew for certain which players were set to improve, well, teams would probably try to hire us because they don't know for sure either. A lot of the fun of the beginning of the season is seeing which players break out unexpectedly. NBA coach rankings: All 30 coaches split into eight tiers as 2025-26 season begins Sam Quinn So today, we're going to try to take a stab at figuring that out. The following 10 players did not make our top 100 ranking. But for one reason or another, they are players who could make us look foolish for excluding them, and then ultimately make next year's list as an apology. Of course, there are some pretty obvious candidates for a list like this, so to make it more interesting, we're going to exclude a few people. For starters, no 2025 rookies are eligible here. We haven't even seen them play. We're also barring No. 1 picks in the first five years of their careers (sorry Zaccharie Risacher ) and Rookie of the Year winners (so long Stephon Castle ). There's no fun in predicting when players like that will make a leap. No, we're looking for slightly deeper cuts here. This list includes just one top-five pick on a rookie contract, and he has played less than 1,000 NBA minutes. Meanwhile, we have two undrafted free agents, two veterans on their fourth NBA teams and another on his third, and a late first-round pick with less than 400 minutes to his name. So here are 10 players, some of whom have obvious paths, others who'd be coming out of nowhere, who could crack next year's top 100 list. Grimes very easily could have made this year's list. He averaged almost 22 points per game as a 76er ... but he did it as a 76er, which meant he did it for the most aggressive tankers of last season. Were those empty calories? Or signs of true growth? We'll find out this season as Grimes attempts to fit into a healthier and hopefully more competitive Philadelphia team than the one he played for last season. Considering his experience as a 3-and-D wing in New York, though, he should be perfectly capable of sliding into the background for the Sixers. Combine the role player skills from his Knicks years and the high-level scoring from March and April, and you have a no-brainer top 100 player. Are we cheating a little bit by excluding the No. 1 pick in 2024 but accepting the No. 3 pick? Maybe, but Zaccharie Risacher played real minutes last season. Sheppard didn't. Now, with Fred VanVleet out, he'll have to. He's fortunately in an ideal situation for his skill set. The Rockets can cover for his size issue on defense and likely won't ask him to handle the ball too much. But they badly need his shooting, and he should be able to get good looks in an offense led by Kevin Durant and Alperen Sengun . Elite shooting can get a player onto the top 100. Payton Pritchard is the obvious analogue. We don't know if Sheppard is ready for that yet, but the Rockets wouldn't have taken him No. 3 if they didn't think he could get there. Everything is lining up for Sharpe this season. He's been a training camp standout by all accounts. He has Jrue Holiday and Damian Lillard in the building as mentors. Portland has seemingly solved its defense. What it needs is a primary scorer on offense, and with Scoot Henderson out early in the season, Sharpe won't even have competition from another high lottery pick. This is his moment to prove that he can be a cornerstone player. He has the athletic gifts. If he can make 3s consistently and improve his decision-making, he's an obvious top 100 candidate for next season and a possible Most Improved Player this year. At his peak in 2021, Deandre Ayton ranked 51st on our top 100 list. We weren't abnormally high on him either. The Pacers gave him a max offer sheet, and then the Suns matched it. He has the tools to be a high-level starting center. Lately, he hasn't had the motivation. But how many times have we seen a down-on-his-luck veteran join a LeBron James team and suddenly rediscover his old magic ? Is Ayton really that different from 2020 Dwight Howard ? He's in an ideal position now. Between James, Austin Reaves and Luka Dončić, he's never had more playmaking around him. If that doesn't motivate him to play harder and do the dirty work, nothing will. But if we get the 2021 version of him in a contract year? It's not hard to imagine him making it back onto the list next year. Matas Buzelis flashed just about every important skill at some point last season. His handle needs work, but it was impressive for a rookie of his size. He was a league-average shooter last year on reasonable volume, which few saw coming, and he was a surprisingly capable defensive playmaker already. But you're not here for that stuff. You're here for the 6-10 dude with insane hops throwing down monster jams. The other stuff is what he needs to be a well-rounded NBA player. The hope is that he continues to grow as a ball-handler, that his shooting growth continues. If that happens, he has star potential. But that stuff takes time. What we'll absolutely see this season is this athletic giant running the floor and owning highlight reels on one of the league's fastest teams. He's already a nerd favorite. He'll be a social media darling before long as well. Our top 100, especially the bottom half, is stuffed full of 3-and-D role players. Nickeil Alexander-Walker has never been a full-time starter and he snuck into the final slot. Ellis hasn't had the widespread exposure that Alexander-Walker did on a contending Timberwolves team because he's been stuck on the Kings , but he's an absolutely ferocious point-of-attack defender who's made just under 43% of his 3s in his three NBA seasons. If he played for a normal team, he'd have made the list by now. If he keeps this up, not even the Kings will be able to hold him off from future editions. Last year gave fans a newfound appreciation for a very specific sort of role player: those who can't play significant minutes for stylistic and durability-related reasons but absolutely own the minutes they do play. Think of Steven Adams in Houston last year, or Ty Jerome in Cleveland. T.J. McConnell almost won Indiana a championship in 18-minute increments. You could make credible arguments for any of them making the list under the logic that they are absolutely among the best 100 players in the NBA on a per-minute basis. The one I'll call attention to this season is Lonzo Ball, who is a match made in heaven for a Cleveland team that badly needed more transition creativity and on-ball defense. If Ball can give the Cavaliers 20 good minutes per night, the specific things he'll bring are so valuable that there will be a strong argument to get him back into the top 100 mix. A lot of the ingredients we've touched on for other players apply here. Newfound opportunity? Check. Without Tyrese Haliburton , someone needs to handle the ball more in Indiana. Contract year? Check. A good year could make Mathurin a lot of money. Draft pedigree? Check. Mathurin was a No. 6 pick, and even if he runs hot and cold, the playoffs showed just how valuable he can be when he's hot. If you can score in the mid-20s against Oklahoma City's historic defense multiple times in the Finals, there's a very valuable player hidden in there somewhere. Now, with the Pacers going through a gap year, we'll see if Mathurin can discover that form on a more permanent basis. I promised you deep cuts, didn't I? Shannon barely played last year... but Minnesota trusted him enough to give him real minutes in the Western Conference finals. Alexander-Walker is gone and someone has to take on his bench role, but with Mike Conley aging fast, there's also going to be a juicy playmaking opportunity available for Minnesota's young players if they can seize it. Rob Dillingham , as the higher draft pick, would be the obvious suspect. He's younger and has more theoretical upside. But Shannon is immediately playable on offense and was surprisingly stout defensively for a low-minutes rookie. If you can score consistently without taking other significant skills off the table, you can be a very valuable player pretty quickly. That's the argument here. Shannon will have a bigger role this season to showcase the rest of his game, and there were signs last year that were pretty promising. The longest of our long shots, and I do mean that literally, as Huff has a 7-5 wingspan. There is a gaping vacuum at center in Indiana, and their system relies on having a big man who can shoot. Huff was over 40% last season on 12.4 attempts per 100 possessions. He's a strong shot-blocker as well, and he's quite the showman as a dunker. Is he a likely top-100 player? Absolutely not. Come on, he's barely been a rotation player. But you just know someone is emerging out of nowhere in Indiana this season. Rick Carlisle has an 82-game blank slate to work with, and Huff offers the cheapest possible replication of Myles Turner 's skill set. The Pacers will give him every chance to succeed. He's under contract for essentially the minimum through 2028, so if he is a diamond in the rough, the Pacers will have him for the price of a ring pop for the foreseeable future.",https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/nba-top-100-players-2026-27-season-lonzo-ball-quentin-grimes-deandre-ayton,Sport,BBC,,https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2025/10/14/73d23f44-1e61-4a24-bdda-c8ea8ff6d03b/thumbnail/1200x675/6748eda7395ad00a2df5b3df1bbba3b7/lonzo-ball-cavaliers-usatsi.jpg,2025-10-15T06:01:00+00:00,02d77f44c48d4f145d82adad8a31c8a24957a1ec

In fact, 0-12 seemed like a distinct possibility as the hapless Bruins prepared to host Penn State in Week 6. But since Tim Skipper took over as the interim coach, the Bruins have been on rocket fuel. A win over the Nittany Lions and a 38-13 win at Michigan State in Week 7 boosted UCLA out of the Bottom 25 with room to spare. For a team that was ranked all the way down at No. 4 in the premier metric of college football futility on Sept. 30, that's quite an accomplishment. Beating Penn State and then obliterating the Spartans effectively turned the Bruins from a bottom-feeder into a serious problem for its Big Ten opponents. As the Bruins leave the Bottom 25, two more Big Ten teams are entering this week. Purdue staved off its entry as long as it possibly could, but the Boilermakers are here now. More surprising is that Wisconsin has bottomed out so hard. The Badgers have dropped four straight games without much of a fight and have several more significant challenges looming as third-year coach Luke Fickell slips ever closer to the point of no return. Don't be surprised if Wisconsin soon inhabits the same bottom-five level of shame that UCLA recently occupied. This year's Bottom 25 formula has been tweaked to ensure fair representation from across the sport. Each of the Power Four leagues gets an automatic bid to the Bottom 25 each week, and a total of 10 Power Four schools must be represented. College football rankings: Indiana joins the top 3 after Oregon win as Texas, USC climb new CBS Sports 136 Chip Patterson Bottom 25 Rankings ^ Joined Bottom 25 this week Purdue finally arrives Give Purdue some credit for taking longer to get here than expected. But now that the Boilermakers have arrived in the Bottom 25, we're expecting them to be repeat visitors. With games against Michigan , Ohio State and Indiana still remaining, a 2-10 or 3-9 record is quite possible. However, first-year coach Barry Odom doubled the program's win total from last season by winning his first two games. So at least there's that! 25. Arkansas (24) 24. Virginia Tech^ 23. West Virginia (23) 22. Stanford ^ 21. Purdue^ Fickle Fickell Wisconsin just concluded the easier half of its schedule by averaging 8.5 points during four straight losses. How bad could it get in Madison? We're about to find out, as Ohio State and Oregon are the next opponents. Indiana, Illinois , Washington and Minnesota are also left on this slate. The ""worst"" of that bunch is 4-2 Minnesota. Paul Chryst has got to be smirking somewhere after getting canned by the Badgers in 2022 when he had a .720 winning percentage. His replacement, Luke Fickell, is 15-17. 20. Eastern Michigan (7) 19. North Carolina (20) 18. Wisconsin^ 17. South Alabama (17) 16. Arkansas State (12) Dilfer's downfall Celebrity hires are great for headlines and buzz, but UAB is a cautionary tale of how it can go wrong. The Blazers thought it was a good idea to hire former Super Bowl-winning quarterback Trent Dilfer straight from a high school job in Nashville, and they're now paying the price for that mistake. At least Deion Sanders was actually a sitting college coach at Jackson State when Colorado hired him. Sanders also brought stud players like Travis Hunter and Shedeuer Sanders. All Dilfer brought to UAB was embarrassment up until he was fired Sunday with a 9-21 mark midway through his third season. 15. Penn State (22) 14. Air Force (19) 13. UAB^ 12. Nevada (18) 11. Northern Illinois Texas-sized problems Things have gotten so bad at UTEP that second-year coach Scotty Walden benched former five-star quarterback prospect Malachi Nelson this past week and started last year's QB1, Skyler Locklear , instead. It didn't have the desired effect, as the Miners lost 19-8 to a rudderless Liberty team. But there's a silver lining for CFB sickos: the outcome set up a Bottom 25 showdown for Wednesday, as UTEP will take on winless Sam Houston to decide once and for all who the worst team is in Texas . 10.

0dfa462f391b,Alvin Kamara to Chiefs? New WR for Giants' Jaxson Dart? 10 NFL trades that should happen before 2025 deadline,"nfl trade deadline, nfl trades, alvin kamara, giants, chiefs, nfl trade rumors, nfl buyers and sellers, bradley chubb, mark andrews, jaxson dart","Six weeks of the 2025 NFL season are now in the books, which means we're more than 30% through the entire regular season slate. We're also one step closer to this year's in-season trade deadline , the official cutoff for any trades until the 2026 offseason. All 32 teams still have until 4 p.m. ET on Tuesday, Nov. 4, to strike deals involving players or future draft picks. And there are plenty of names already rumored to be part of potential discussions, including veteran quarterbacks like Kirk Cousins and Russell Wilson . Some organizations are surely eager to add last-gasp upgrades. Others might be contemplating selling off talent to rebuild. No matter what, there are indications this October and November will be rife with activity. In the meantime, we decided to assess the entire NFL landscape and propose a couple deals of our own. Here are 10 splashy trade ideas that might actually make sense for both sides in the lead-up to the 2025 deadline, including a blockbuster defensive addition for the San Francisco 49ers and a relocation by a Pro Bowl playmaker to the Denver Broncos : Kamara may want to retire with the New Orleans Saints , but what if the reigning AFC champions call with an offer to join a potential Super Bowl bid? Kansas City isn't ready to trust any of its bruising backs (i.e. Isiah Pacheco , Kareem Hunt , etc.) with a full workload, leaving Patrick Mahomes to do a little too much on the ground. Kamara, meanwhile, has precisely the kind of pass-catching tools that could make him a dream Swiss Army knife for Andy Reid, right alongside Xavier Worthy , Marquise Brown and Co. Would he really turn that down to stay in a rebuild? Los Angeles just got a breakout performance from second-year reserve Kimani Vidal at running back, and rookie Omarion Hampton figures to retain a sizable role once he's back from injury. Still, the Chargers are committed to winning now under Jim Harbaugh. Why wouldn't Harbs consider bolstering the backfield for the stretch run after previously hoping Najee Harris would deepen the bench? Hall is just looking to prove his value ahead of 2026 free agency, and he's not likely to restore it taking carries for the offensively listless New York Jets . Are we sleeping on Carolina at 3-3? The Panthers are such a tough read given Bryce Young's volatility under center, but they're not out of the picture in the NFC South, and theoretically, they should still be in hot pursuit of anyone who can help accelerate Young's growth. Meyers lacks a long-term place with the Las Vegas Raiders , but he's the kind of proven route-runner Adam Thielen once was for the Panthers. He may not stretch the field at this point in his career, but as a savvy rental to pair with rookie Tetairoa McMillan , you could do a lot worse. Shaheed is probably still underrated as a deep threat, averaging almost 16 yards per catch for his career. The problem is, he's due to hit free agency after the season, New Orleans is rebuilding, and Chris Olave is a higher priority for the Saints. That makes him ripe for a potential relocation. And why not New York, where the Giants suddenly have offensive juice thanks to the rugged youth of Jaxson Dart and Cam Skattebo ? With Malik Nabers out due to injury, the wily Dart could really use a field-stretcher out wide. Shaheed is just that and could theoretically stick around, too. We don't believe John Harbaugh and the Baltimore Ravens are interested in completely punting on the rest of the 2025 season, even with the AFC contender deflated at 1-5. But Andrews is aging (30) and Isaiah Likely is already onboard as a longer-term option at tight end, so it's possible the Ravens could try to get something for the Pro Bowler while they can. Washington can't quite stay healthy out wide, and Andrews has enough left in the tank to form a grizzled but proven 1-2 punch with Zach Ertz . You can bet Jayden Daniels would enjoy feeding him. Chig Okonkwo to the Rams Tyler Higbee just had a nice day for Los Angeles, but the former Super Bowl champion has been spotty this year after missing most of 2024 due to injury. Puka Nacua is also freshly banged up out wide, giving Sean McVay's all-star unit a new dose of durability concerns. Enter Okonkwo, who's one of the Tennessee Titans ' few legitimate trade chips thanks to a 71% catch rate for his career. At 26, he's got dual value: as an immediate depth piece to aid Matthew Stafford's passing attack, and as a potential long-term chess piece for McVay's offense. The Cleveland Browns don't exactly scream ""offensive line factory,"" but Teller has been a respected staple of their front for more than a half-decade, earning a trio of Pro Bowl nods along the way. He's likely available because he's on an expiring contract with a team in perpetual transition. The Eagles already pay big bucks to Landon Dickerson at guard, but he's banged up, and fellow interior man Tyler Steen could arguably use relief. Stabilizing, or at least deepening, the trenches could be a first step to unlocking the Saquon Barkley magic that drove the Birds in 2024. If San Francisco isn't gutting out tough wins, it's taking catastrophic losses on the medical front. Sunday marked but the latest, with the 49ers defense losing its heartbeat in All-Pro linebacker Fred Warner (ankle injury). Hendrickson can't fill those shoes, of course, but he can get after quarterbacks, which is something the 49ers need to do more consistently in the wake of Nick Bosa's own exit due to injury. Yes, he finally settled contract talks with the Cincinnati Bengals prior to the season, but he's still a candidate to be moved as a pending free agent. Raise your hand if you expected Indianapolis to be 5-1 atop the AFC South after six games. And yes, Daniel Jones is still running the show on offense! Why not strike while the iron is hot if you're Colts brass and go all in on a prospective postseason push, attempting a Von Miller-like rental with Chubb, who's been one of the few bright spots on the Miami Dolphins ' defense this year? He's approaching 30 with an injury history, but he's got the sack artistry to further elevate a Colts team that keeps winning ballgames by controlling and running the ball with great efficiency. If the Dolphins deal Chubb, it stands to reason they'll keep Phillips, the other big name in their pass rushing arsenal. But it's just as likely they'd field offers for both edge veterans, considering Phillips is a pending free agent with a much streakier resume. The Jaguars aren't necessarily hurting for defensive talent after opening the year as a top-10 scoring ""D,"" but they rank near the bottom of the NFL in terms of total sacks in 2025. New general manager James Gladstone isn't averse to gambles, and Phillips would at least offer future upside, provided he stayed put.",https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/alvin-kamara-to-chiefs-new-wr-for-giants-10-nfl-trades-that-should-happen-2025-deadline,Sport,BBC,,https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2025/08/13/4cc01bfc-58f2-4982-8bc5-4a928992f19a/thumbnail/1200x675/002daf9c1f35fb924d2a77bb1f18f590/alvin-kamara.jpg,2025-10-15T05:59:00+00:00,11b090a19cec1fa42331aae7210d510c5f577398
3e59e975ebac,"‘Samsara,’ ‘It Was Just an Accident,’ ‘Magellan’ Lead Asia Pacific Screen Awards Nominations",,"Garin Nugroho’s “ Samsara ,” Jafar Panahi’s “ It Was Just an Accident ” and Lav Diaz’s “ Magellan ” are among the top nominees for the 18th Asia Pacific Screen Awards (APSA), the Asia Pacific Screen Academy has revealed. The Indonesian drama “Samsara” leads with three nominations, while “It Was Just an Accident” (Iran, France, Luxembourg) and “Magellan” (Portugal, Spain, France, Philippines, Taiwan) each earned two nominations. Cai Shangjun’s “The Sun Rises on Us All” (China) and Sho Miyake’s “Two Seasons, Two Strangers” (Japan) round out the best film category, also with two nominations apiece. These five films are competing in additional categories including best director, best cinematography and best performance. “Yunan” (Germany, Canada, Italy, Palestine, Qatar, Jordan, Saudi Arabia) also earned multiple nominations for best cinematography and best performance. In a notable trend, 48% of the directors of nominated films are presenting only their first or second feature, underscoring the awards’ role in launching emerging talent from the region. The best animated film category is particularly striking, with all nominated directors making their directorial debuts. “With almost half the nominated works being debut features, 2025 is a testament to the vitality and innovation of emerging voices across our diverse region,” said Tracey Vieira, chair of the Asia Pacific Screen Awards. The ceremony will take place Nov. 27 at The Langham, Gold Coast and Jewel Private Residences, in partnership with strategic sponsor Jewel Private Residences. The event runs alongside the 7th Asia Pacific Screen Forum, scheduled for Nov. 24-27, under the theme Beyond Borders. The forum will focus on five key areas: transcending boundaries through innovative collaborations, cultural bridge-building, self-empowerment in a fragmented world, innovation over convention, and transforming vision into reality. Programming includes the initiative Post Code Doesn’t Matter, led by Women in Film & Television Australia, sessions on development and breaking into new markets, and country-specific roundtables. “It is an exciting time for the Gold Coast to host this important event where we will see filmmakers across the Asia Pacific region come with a project and leave with a pathway,” Vieira added. The event is supported by major partners including the City of Gold Coast, Screen Queensland, Motion Picture Association Asia Pacific, The Langham Gold Coast, and The Post Lounge Group. APSA represents 78 countries and areas across the Asia Pacific region. FULL LIST OF NOMINEES Best Film “It Was Just an Accident” — Islamic Republic of Iran, France, Luxembourg.

91e86412db4b,"Fremantle’s Doc ‘Luca: Seeing Red’ Not Just About Ferrari, Argue Protagonist Luca di Montezemolo and Director Manish Pandey: ‘Family, Italy, Loyalty’",,"Fremantle ’s new documentary “ Luca: Seeing Red ” takes on the former Ferrari chairman Luca di Montezemolo. But it’s not just about Ferrari. “That was one of the conditions. First – it won’t be just about Ferrari. Second – it won’t be fiction. You don’t want to see an actor playing Kimi Räikkönen, you want to see Kimi Räikkönen. Third – it won’t be about my private life,” di Montezemolo tells Variety in Cannes. “If you’re passionate about racing and cars, you’ll see them. You’ll see Enzo Ferrari, Michael Schumacher, Niki Lauda’s accident and his face, scarred by fire. But this film is also about Italy.” As well as di Montezemolo’s other ventures, from the launch of yacht racing team Azzurra – “People named their daughters after it!” – to co-founding train transport company Italo and spearheading the final concert of Three Tenors. “It was difficult to convince Pavarotti. He said: ‘Why do I have to share [the stage] with these two guys? I can do it myself’,” he laughs, recalling the event that united Pavarotti with Plácido Domingo and José Carreras. “This movie has given me the possibility to reflect on all the things I’ve done.” Joined by “Top Gear’s” Chris Harris, in the doc, di Montezemolo’s looking back on a long road that started in the 1970s when Enzo Ferrari hired him as an assistant. “I was only 25 years old, but I’ve always liked to take risks and put my face up front. I won 19 Formula One championship titles, but I know how much work is behind these victories. You have to pick the right people and have clear goals, but I’ve been lucky to have art in my life, my family and my friends. Apart from maybe your health, these are the absolute priorities.” While the film – presented to buyers at Mipcom – offers “a nice mix of archive and new material,” some of the glamour remains intact. “Ferrari is a myth,” states di Montezemolo. “Even Räikkönen, when he started to race for Sauber and McLaren, told me Ferrari was always his dream [he won the 2007 Formula One World Championship while driving for it]. There’s this beautiful shot of a red Ferrari in the film, in Bologna’s square called Piazza delle Sette Chiese. We are showing different Italy from that stereotypical [combo] of Florence, Venice and Rome.” Director Manish Pandey , also behind award-winning “Senna,” notes: “For me, this film is about two things. The background is Italy, of course, but it’s about loyalty and about family. That’s the common theme in every single frame. There’s a key line right at the end: ‘Apart from my family, Ferrari is the most important thing in my life’.” “To tell this story, you need to understand Luca and you need to understand Italy. That’s why we put him together with Chris, who sees Luca as a father figure,” he says, calling the third act of the film “essential.” “You see him always saying ‘yes’ to the Agnellis [behind Fiat], and then they give him the impossible job. And that’s suddenly when Chris is in the film. There’s a turning point. He spends two thirds of the story listening. But in the last act, he’s absolutely a part of the drama. And it’s a difficult one: it’s a corporate assassination, happening right in front of you.” The film was already shown in Rome and in London. “Obviously, this is not a fictional Formula One movie with Brad Pitt. But [theatrical partner] Everyman Cinemas saw it and loved it. They put it in 30 cinemas and 18 of these screenings were completely sold out,” says Pandey. In Rome, it was shown to selected audience at the Parco della Musica Auditorium. “I was so happy that 900 people came there for me, and not for some actor or actress. I didn’t expect it,” adds di Montezemolo. “In Rome, when people watch a film, they usually talk to each other or comment. Now, it was silent.”",https://variety.com/2025/tv/global/luca-seeing-red-ferrari-luca-di-montezemolo-manish-pandey-1236552745,Entertainment,BBC,Marta Balaga,https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Use-This-as-the-Lead-Photo-1.jpg?w=1000&h=563&crop=1,2025-10-15T06:00:00+00:00,4cbd3c8b6b4e7713e6a1cdf1e72d7d97d18ca706
044737cf5161,"FilmSharks Secures Rights to Political Action Thriller Project ‘Insurrección,’ Teams With ‘El Capo”s Marlon Moreno (EXCLUSIVE)",,"Guido Rud ‘s Buenos Aires-based FilmSharks has secured all rights — including derivative IP — to “Insurrección,” a provocative and politically charged action-thriller film project, teaming with acclaimed Colombian actor-producer Marlon Moreno (“El Capo,” “Dog Eat Dog”). Written by Colombian screenwriter Mauricio Marulanda González, “Insurrección” is in development with plans for dual Spanish and English-language versions. Envisioned as “Public Enemy” meets “The Bourne Identity” (meets “Nuevo Orden”), the project seeks to fuse high-octane genre storytelling with a sharp sociopolitical pulse. For the Spanish-language version, Marlon Moreno – of Disney+ TV series “El Capo,” Sundance hit “Dog Eat Dog,” Netflix top ranked series “La Venganza de Analía” and box office success “Corazón de León” –  is joining as executive producer and creative collaborator, bringing both star power and creative vision. Set against a backdrop of corruption and social unrest, “Insurrección” follows Nicolás Díaz, a law professor who, disillusioned by the system, leads a masked insurgent cell that live-streams the trials and executions of high-ranking politicians. As their message electrifies the public, state forces hunt to unmask the mysterious leader —only to discover he has assumed the identity of a man who died 22 years earlier. The project fits FilmSharks’ strategy of developing bold, socially reflective IPs with crossover potential. “You have to bet on stories with impact, without fearing whether they’re politically correct or not,” Rud told Variety . “‘Insurrección’ echoes the unrest of Ibero-American societies – a cry against inequality and manipulation. It’s an IP built for high controversy, deep debate, and massive audience engagement.” Moreno described the project as an artistically ambitious and emotionally resonant reflection of today’s world. “It’s not just a story — it’s a pulse, a collective and intimate call to question power, memory, and dignity,” he said. “It merges the personal and the epic to interrogate the times we live in.” The announcement strengthens FilmSharks’ position as one of Ibero-America’s leading indie movie outfits. With over 35 production credits and partnerships with Sony, Warner Bros., Universal, Disney, Videocine, and Patagonik, FilmSharks continues expanding from sales and remakes into high-concept original development. A force in the crossover world of Latin American and Hollywood cinema, Rud is also involved in upcoming or recent titles such as Demian Rugna’s genre film “Félix,” sci-fi movie “Pacífico,” with “Undertow’s” Manolo Cardona; Pancho Rodríguez’s Disney-backed thriller “Abracadáver” and Hugo Cardozo’s “Do Not Enter,” sold to over 45 territories for theatrical release.",https://variety.com/2025/film/global/filmsharks-insurreccion-marlon-moreno-latin-american-thriller-1236552935,Entertainment,BBC,Emiliano De Pablos,https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/MARLON-MORENO.jpg?w=1000&h=563&crop=1,2025-10-15T06:00:00+00:00,02068227d52fa228df7dbd59b0f0a5557a87524d
d37bf89825bb,"‘High Wire’ Director Calif Chong on Stephen Chow Dreams, BFI London Film Festival Premiere and Making Immigration Funny",,"When Calif Chong was growing up in a working-class Hong Kong household, no one in her family went to the cinema. But Stephen Chow’s comedies changed everything for her. “I thought, oh my God, if I could become the female version of Stephen Chow, how cool would that be?” Chong recalls. “You make everyone laugh. You make everyone just love films.” Now, with her feature debut “ High Wire ” world premiering at the BFI London Film Festival , Chong has achieved something equally ambitious: crafting a comedy-drama that speaks to the immigrant experience while making audiences laugh and feel. “High Wire” follows Go-wing, a British-Chinese takeaway girl who discovers her inner strength and artistic bravery when a circus comes to her small English town. The film stars Isabella Wei , known for her breakout role in Netflix’s “1899,” alongside Hong Kong actor Dominic Lam. For Chong, the project represents a deliberate choice to make her debut feature a comedy. “My short film [“Underneath”] was really hard drama, and while making, it was really difficult,” she explains. “I wanted this full-length film to be enjoyable throughout for everyone who makes the film, who acts, who edits the film. We try to make people laugh. That’s the goal.” But beneath the humor lies something deeper. The film explores family dynamics within the Chinese community, a subject Chong feels hasn’t been portrayed with enough nuance on screen. “In the Chinese community, the family relationship is still very complex, but it’s not portrayed well,” she says. “It’s always a bit sad. I come from that background, and I know there is a lot of trauma, but for my debut, I wanted to be a mix of hard drama, but also comedy.” Chong’s journey to filmmaking was unconventional. She started as a creative trainee at TVB, Hong Kong’s major television network, working as a junior scriptwriter for two years. She then collaborated with director Lawrence Lau on film scripts, though the financial realities of Hong Kong’s screenwriting landscape proved challenging. “I really couldn’t afford that lifestyle, so I had to work,” Chong explains. She took a job at RTHK, Hong Kong’s equivalent of the BBC, working in documentary filmmaking before eventually winning a pitching competition at the Berlin Film Festival. That success convinced her to pursue international opportunities. She moved to London to study at the London Film School, taking on significant debt to make it happen. “Me and my mom kind of made it work,” she says. “And yeah, here I am. Made my first feature and screening in London Film Festival.” Casting the lead role presented unique challenges. Chong needed someone who could speak both English and Cantonese fluently, read Chinese script, dance professionally, and rollerblade — a particularly niche skill in the U.K. Wei, a Hong Kong actress and dancer who made her television debut in Netflix’s “1899,” proved to be the perfect fit. “She is just perfect. She ticks all the boxes,” Chong says. “She’s bilingual, she can read Chinese, her acting is amazing.” What surprised Chong was how Wei’s interpretation added unexpected depth to the character. Where Chong had initially envisioned Go-wing as upbeat and extroverted, Wei brought an introverted quality that resonated deeply with the director’s own experience. “I see myself there,” Chong reflects. “I’m not extroverted when I’m being put in a foreign place. You’re kind of timid, you’re kind of second-guessing yourself, you kind of worry you’re not going to fit in. Her portrayal in a different way kind of brings more complexity, which I never imagined.” The circus element came about through producer connections, Djonny Chen of Silent D Pictures, but Chong immediately saw its potential as a metaphor for the immigrant experience. Working with Circus Extreme, she was struck by how modern circus pushes human limits — much like immigrants pushing against societal constraints. “People don’t see it as an art form, somehow,” she notes. “That’s kind of the same as how the Western world had misconceptions of Asian people. They don’t understand Asian culture, and then they portray Asian people in a certain way on screen.” Working with cinematographer Matthew P. Scott, Chong created distinct visual languages for Go-wing’s two worlds. In the takeaway, camera movements are static and still, reflecting constraint. In the circus, everything flows in circles, reflecting freedom and possibility. The North Yorkshire landscape also became a character itself. “Hong Kong is so packed, and you feel so suffocated,” Chong explains. “Whereas in Yorkshire, it’s the other way around. It’s extremely vast, it’s extremely nothing else. It’s wilderness.” Depicting racism proved one of the film’s most delicate challenges. Chong, who has experienced racism firsthand since moving to the U.K., was determined not to make “High Wire” a message movie. “I really wanted to play it out as comedy,” she explains. “We do have some racial slurs written, but that was real. I didn’t make it up. But the most important thing is we don’t drill into those. We don’t focus on those hatred towards us.” The film intentionally includes a white British friend, to reflect the reality of genuine cross-cultural friendships. “That’s real life. We do make friends,” Chong says. “We can’t just focus on a small group of people who don’t know us. We focus on the people who want to.” Recent events in the U.K. — including anti-immigrant protests — have made the film feel even more urgent. Chong describes a distressing incident in the London tube where she heard anti-immigrant rhetoric. “Sometimes your reality is one thing, but people around you make you feel like something else,” she reflects. “You feel like you’re still other group.” Beyond the London Film Festival premiere, Chong hopes to bring “High Wire” to Hong Kong audiences. She’s already working on her next project, exploring thriller and dark comedy territory, and is interested in directing television, citing shows like “Slow Horses” and “The Gentlemen” as inspirations. “I just love shows like that,” she says. “I want to see some women directing these really male-driven stories.” For now, Chong hopes “High Wire” will resonate globally. “I want it to be something really reachable, accessible. Anyone can watch it, not just British Hong Kong immigrants, not just Asian immigrants, but I think it should speak to any immigrants,” she says. “I hope films is the one thing that can draw us together and we can welcome each other.”",https://variety.com/2025/film/festivals/high-wire-calif-chong-stephen-chow-bfi-london-film-festival-racism-1236553223,Entertainment,BBC,Naman Ramachandran,https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Isabella-Wei-High-Wire.jpg?w=1000&h=563&crop=1,2025-10-15T07:04:21+00:00,acf63a68daa1238a5b76b75bb283771097e4216a
008c56ca9c9a,Kenyan opposition leader Raila Odinga dies of heart attack in India at 80,"news, politics, africa, asia, india, kenya","Kenyan opposition leader Raila Odinga, ​​a key figure in African politics, has died at the age of 80 during a trip to India for medical treatment, according to local police and hospital officials. The former prime minister, who as opposition leader had waged five unsuccessful presidential campaigns between 1997 and 2022, had suffered a heart attack, the Devamatha Hospital in the southern Indian state of Kerala confirmed to The Associated Press news agency on Wednesday. Odinga was a dominant force in Kenyan politics, and his death will leave a significant leadership vacuum within the country’s political opposition ahead of elections in 2027. An Indian police official told the AFP news agency that Odinga had been on a morning walk, accompanied by his sister, daughter, a personal doctor, and Indian and Kenyan security officers, when he collapsed. “He was rushed to a nearby private hospital, but was declared dead,” said Krishnan M, additional superintendent of police in Ernakulam, Kerala. Unnamed officials in Odinga’s office also confirmed the death to news agencies. Indian newspaper Mathrubhumi had earlier reported the death, adding that Odinga had been undergoing medical treatment in the state’s Kochi city. Sreedhareeyam Ayurvedic hospital in Koothattukulam in India’s southern state of Kerala, where Raila Odinga had been undergoing treatment [AP Photo] Pro-democracy campaigner Born on January 7, 1945, Odinga was the son of the country’s first vice president after independence in 1963. A member of the Luo tribe, he spent most of his adult life in politics, including time in exile and eight years in prison as a pro-democracy campaigner – but never achieved his goal of becoming Kenya’s president. Odinga first entered parliament in 1992, and ran unsuccessful presidential campaigns in 1997, 2007, 2013, 2017 and 2022. He claimed to have been cheated of victory in the last four elections, and led protests after the disputed 2007 election that led to Kenya’s most serious bout of political violence since independence. About 1,300 people were killed and hundreds of thousands displaced from their homes in the battles. Large-scale protests also broke out during the 2017 election, in which the Supreme Court annulled the results of an initial poll, and Odinga withdrew from the follow-up, saying it would not be free and fair. Odinga’s pro-democracy activism over the years helped drive two of the country’s most significant political reforms: multiparty democracy in 1991 and a new constitution in 2010. In March, he signed a pact with Kenyan President William Ruto that saw his opposition Azimio la Umoja party involved in critical policymaking and its members appointed to the cabinet. ‘A great leader’ Kenya’s former chief justice and presidential hopeful, David Maraga, said he was “shocked” by news of Odinga’s death. Odinga was “a patriot, a pan-Africanist, a democrat and a leader who made significant contributions to democracy in Kenya and in Africa”, Maraga wrote on X. “Kenya has lost one of its most formidable leaders who shaped the trajectory of our beloved country. Africa has lost a leading voice in pushing for peace, security and development. The world has lost a great leader,” he added. Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed was among the first to react, posting on X: “On behalf of the Government of Ethiopia, I extend my sincere condolences on the passing of former Kenyan Prime Minister Raila Odinga. May he Rest In Peace.”",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/15/kenyan-opposition-leader-raila-odinga-dies-of-heart-attack-in-india-at-80,World,BBC,Tim Hume,https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/AP23090667771264.jpg?resize=1920%2C1440,,5ee679db5d9a9162562408f70ddd4022e05d62b8

Published On 15 Oct 2025 15 Oct 2025 Click here to share on social media share2 Share Far-right American influencer Candace Owens has lost a legal bid to be allowed to enter Australia after a court ruled with the government that granting her a visitor visa could “incite discord in the Australian community”. The High Court of Australia said in its ruling on Wednesday that the government’s decision to refuse Owens a visa in 2024 “was not invalid” and ordered her to pay the government’s legal costs in the case. Recommended Stories list of 4 items end of list The court “unanimously” ruled that the article in Australia’s Migration Act used by the government against Owens “applies where, in the event that the person were allowed to enter or to remain in Australia, there is a risk that the person would stir up or encourage dissension or strife in the Australian community, or a segment of that community”. Owens, a well-known right-wing podcast host and political pundit who has built a large online following for controversial views and conspiracy theories, applied for an Australian visa to undertake a commercial speaking tour in November 2024. Australia’s Home Affairs Minister Tony Burke – who has the powers to deny noncitizens entry based on a “character test” – rejected Owens’s application in October 2024 due to the risk of her views “leading to increased hostility and violent or radical action”. Burke had cited her public comments on the Holocaust and other Islamophobic remarks. “From downplaying the impact of the Holocaust with comments about Mengele through to claims that Muslims started slavery, Candace Owens has the capacity to incite discord in almost every direction,” the minister said last year, according to Australia’s Herald Sun news outlet, referring to Josef Mengele, the Nazi physician who conducted experiments on Jewish prisoners at Auschwitz. Owens appealed the minister’s decision to the High Court on the grounds that refusing her a visa infringed on freedom of political communication, though in Australia – unlike the United States – there is no express constitutional right to free speech. “The implied freedom is not a ‘personal right’, is not unlimited and is not absolute,” High Court Judges Stephen Gageler, Michelle Gordon and Robert Beech-Jones said in their joint judgement on the case. The judges noted that Burke had denied Owens a visa after examining her views and comments on areas including antiracism, Black Lives Matter, anti-Semitism, women’s and LGBTQ rights, COVID-19 and anti-vaccination. Burke had found her views to be “extremist and inflammatory comments towards Muslim, Black, Jewish and LGBTQIA+ communities which generate controversy and hatred”, and the minister concluded that she had failed the “character test” required for a visa and that allowing her into the country would not be in the national interest, the judges said. Owens’s “submissions should be emphatically rejected”, High Court Judge James Edelman said in a separate judgement. In July, Australia also cancelled the visa of US rapper Ye, formerly known as Kanye West, over concerns he would have promoted Nazi ideologies in his song “Heil Hitler”.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/15/far-right-us-influencer-candace-owens-loses-legal-fight-to-enter-australia,World,BBC,Kevin Doyle,https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/AP21203767369821-1-1760509647.jpg?resize=1920%2C1389,,96437436edd6cb576a911e60a90c584fc2e91faa
42a051859693,‘Surveillance pricing’: Why you might be paying more than your neighbour,"features, news, business and economy, explainer, retail, science and technology, united states, us & canada","You go into a store to buy a two-litre bottle of milk at your local supermarket and pay $3. But the person before you in the queue paid $3.50. And the person after you paid $2. What if those prices were based on your personal data or circumstances, or even the battery power on your phone? This may sound like science fiction, but it’s not as far-fetched as you might think. In July, US group Delta Air Lines revealed that approximately 3 percent of its domestic fare pricing is determined using artificial intelligence (AI) – although it has not elaborated on how this happens. The company said it aims to increase this figure to 20 percent by the end of this year. The news raised concerns among consumers that Delta might be using customers’ data to determine what to charge them. So, US Senators Mark Warner, Ruben Gallego and Richard Blumenthal sent a letter to Delta Air Lines requesting further information about its reported plans to implement AI-driven “dynamic pricing”. “Delta’s current and planned individualised pricing practices not only present data privacy concerns but will also likely mean fare price increases up to each individual consumer’s personal ‘pain point’ at a time when American families are already struggling with rising costs,” the letter stated. Although Delta did not deny using AI to set prices, it replied, telling the senators that it does not use it for “discriminatory or predatory pricing practices”. According to former Federal Trade Commission Chair Lina Khan, however, some companies are able to use your personal data to predict what they know as your “pain point” – the maximum amount you’re willing to spend for a specific good or service. In January, the US’s Federal Trade Commission (FTC), which regulates fair competition, reported on a surveillance pricing study it carried out in July 2024. It found that companies can collect data directly through account registrations, email sign-ups and online purchases in order to do this. Additionally, web pixels installed by intermediaries track digital signals including your IP address, device type, browser information, language preferences and “granular” website interactions such as mouse movements, scrolling patterns and video viewing behaviour. This is known as “surveillance pricing”. What is surveillance pricing? Surveillance pricing is the practice of monitoring consumer data to set individualised prices in order to maximise profits for the retailer. Put simply, having access to your personal information enables retailers to charge you the most they think you will be willing to pay. In a 2024 research paper , Oren Bar-Gill, legal scholar and economist at New York University, describes surveillance pricing as follows: “Fuelled by big data, algorithmic price discrimination enables sellers to parse the population of potential customers into finer and finer subcategories – each matched with a different price. “In some cases, sellers are even able to set personalised pricing, marching down the demand curve and setting a different price for each consumer.” In an interview with economist Robert Reich in July this year, Khan said: “Evidence shows that ride-sharing apps are charging different prices for the exact same rides at the exact same time. It’s not entirely clear, but researchers ran tests and found that riders with lower battery life on their phone were charged more.” Uber denies it is deliberately targeting any of its app users with higher prices. However, its former head of economic research, Keith Chen, did reveal in an NPR interview in 2016 that the company had discovered that users with low battery life were more likely to accept surge pricing. “Uber has found that those with a low battery tend to accept the surge price regardless, because they need a ride home that minute, instead of waiting an extra 15 for the surge to possibly go down. “We absolutely don’t use that to kind of push you a higher surge price, but it’s an interesting kind of psychological fact of human behaviour.” Then, in 2023, an investigation by Belgian newspaper La Derniere Heure also found that prices for the same journey on the Uber app can be different for different users. In particular, its test found that the same ride from the newspaper’s office in Brussels would cost more ordered from a phone with 12 percent battery – 17.56 euros ($20.51) than from one with 84 percent – 16.60 euros ($19.39). When approached for comment, Uber denied this, stating: “Uber does not take into account the phone’s battery level to calculate the price of a trip. The dynamic pricing applied to trips booked via Uber is determined by the existing demand for rides and the supply of drivers who can respond to it.” How does surveillance pricing work, exactly? Retailers can monitor your online behaviour by recording what you click on, your browsing time, location and device choice and combine all this with your purchase history to determine your “price sensitivity”. “Price sensitivity” typically measures how much customers’ buying behaviours change in response to shifts in product prices. To do all this, they use AI surveillance tools to produce pricing recommendations. These sophisticated systems operate across a spectrum, from broad store-wide pricing strategies to personalised, real-time price adjustments tailored to individual user behaviour patterns. A wide range of consumer-facing businesses – both online-only and high-street retailers – including grocery, apparel, health and beauty, home goods, convenience, hardware and general merchandise retailers, were included in the January FTC surveillance pricing study. According to the study, these are some of the ways retailers are using surveillance pricing to various degrees: Targeting ‘reluctant gamblers’: For instance, the study found, “if a hypothetical customer who visits a sports betting website demonstrates hesitation by lingering on the homepage longer than expected or moves their cursor towards the button to close out their browser tab, the website may trigger a pop-up showing popular sporting events to incentivise the visitor to remain on the website and place a bet.” Targeting inexperienced buyers: For example, a car dealership could offer an in-store kiosk to help customers explore different vehicle models, features, and financial options for a car. This customer can then potentially be “segmented” as a “first-time car buyer”, implying the shopper might be “less savvy about the options available and be promoted particular financing rates, trade-in discounts, or maintenance products”, the study concluded. Targeting customers selecting ‘fast delivery’ option: For example, a parent selecting the “fast delivery” option for a purchase of baby formula could be a rushed parent who may be less “price-sensitive”. Excluding loyal customers from discounts: For example, the study said, a pharmacy could choose to exclude regular customers from a special promotion for over-the-counter medications or weight-loss supplements because it believes those customers would buy the products anyway. “Instead, it may target discount codes to a group of infrequent buyers for these products who may be ‘at risk’ of disengaging.” Analysing customer behaviour: “Actions like placing an item in a cart, but not purchasing, or sorting a feed of products from ‘lowest’ to ‘highest’ price, could hypothetically be used to infer aspects such as a shopper’s emotional state, purchase intent, or financial sensitivity,” the study concluded. Video engagement: Online retailers can determine how likely someone is to pay higher prices through measuring their engagement with information videos, the study found. “An online retailer for survivalist gear, for example, could use the information that a site visitor watched at least 65 percent of a video on its homepage as a signal that they might be receptive to text messages urging them to make a purchase,” it said. Using personal data for targeted advertisements: For example, a cosmetics company could collect information on consumers’ skin types or skin tone through a survey. “The company can then use that information about skin tone to target consumers with ads or promotions,” the study found. Location-based pricing: Retailers can tailor their websites so that visitors see only the specific prices featured in the store nearest to their location. How is AI used in surveillance pricing? Retailers are using AI to gather detailed information about consumers, including login data, location, browsing behaviour, “abandoned cart items”, and even mouse movement patterns, and then feeding this information into pricing algorithms. AI assesses an individual’s willingness to pay (WTP), then systematically tests various price points to identify the optimal price which will generate the most revenue. “Sellers are increasingly utilising big data and sophisticated algorithms to price discriminate among customers,” says Bar-Gill. “Indeed, we are approaching a world in which each consumer will be charged a personalised price for a personalised product or service … many retailers and travel sites set personalised prices that vary by hundreds of dollars from one consumer to the next.” He adds that intermediaries who specialise in identifying consumers’ willingness to pay (WTP) and sell this information to retailers have also begun to emerge. Is this even allowed? Yes, but it is increasingly being called into question. This year so far, US state legislators have introduced 51 bills across 24 states aimed at regulating algorithmic pricing, a significant rise from the 10 bills passed in all of 2024. Many of these legislative measures specifically target rent-setting software, which enables price-fixing in housing markets. Advocates are also pushing for limits on surveillance-driven pricing that tailors costs based on personal data, location or browsing behaviour. In particular: On May 9, New York Governor Kathy Hochul signed A3008, banning undisclosed personalised algorithmic pricing. Two Ohio Senate bills, SB 79 and SB 328, require businesses earning more than $5m to inform consumers if a price or term comes from a pricing algorithm. California Assembly Bill 446 sought to ban surveillance pricing with personal data. However, it faced strong opposition and was mostly struck down, though debate continues on other bills. Other countries are also introducing regulations. As of April 2025, the Digital Markets, Competition and Consumers Act DMCCA lets the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA), the United Kingdom’s main competition regulator, fine companies up to 10 percent of global revenue for unfair or misleading consumer practices, including hidden or biased digital pricing. Public participation and regulatory legislation will continue to play an important role in reducing the risk of corporations using personal data for unfair pricing practices. Is surveillance pricing new? Not really – it’s more that the name of this practice has changed over time. It has previously been known as “price discrimination” or “dynamic pricing”. In 2008, Norwich Union, the UK’s largest insurer, now called Aviva, discontinued its “Pay As You Drive” car insurance policy due to customer fears about surveillance and privacy. The “Pay As You Drive” scheme used satellite technology and tracking devices to monitor drivers’ travel patterns, providing discounted premiums to customers who avoided high-risk driving periods. Today, many UK insurers provide surveillance equipment known as a “black box”, which new drivers plug into their cars. The better you drive, the lower your premiums. In the 2000s, Amazon experimented with dynamic pricing, offering varied DVD prices using customer browsing data and website cookies. After many customer complaints, debates about fairness and transparency in e-commerce began. Some critics argued Amazon’s practice resembled price discrimination, raising ethical concerns. Amazon said the pricing experiment selected random customers only and denied intentionally targeting specific buyers. However, in a September 2000 statement, Amazon issued an apology to customers regarding the price-testing programme and said it had ceased the experiment. “We’ve never tested and we never will test prices based on customer demographics,” Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos said in a statement. “What we did was a random price test, and even that was a mistake because it created uncertainty for customers rather than simplifying their lives.” How can consumers protect themselves from price discrimination? The FTC Surveillance Pricing report lists several ways in which consumers can protect their data. These include using private browsers to do your online shopping, opting out of consumer tracking where possible, clearing the cookies in your history or using virtual private networks (VPNs) to shield your data from being collected. It noted, however, “These steps can be difficult to maintain and may not be fully effective, since many companies use device fingerprinting or other less obvious tracking methods.” Device fingerprinting allows companies to track people by using unique information from their devices, such as their browser settings and what hardware and software they use. Consumers can also use “private mode” when browsing to hide their activity or just share less personal data. However, advanced tracking technologies still make it difficult to fully escape surveillance-driven pricing mechanisms. In its July 2024 Surveillance Price Gouging report , California nonprofit organisation Consumer Watchdog recommended that consumers demand more openness from retailers by insisting they disclose how they use personal information to determine pricing, and use existing privacy settings and data opt-out options.",https://www.aljazeera.com/features/2025/10/15/surveillance-pricing-why-you-might-be-paying-more-than-your-neighbour,World,BBC,Dwayne Oxford,https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/epa_68d6e0eac89c-1758912746.jpg?resize=1920%2C1440,,e756ed143d2862a7bbcdda7485b2a37cb94c204a
9c6ec65b1dd5,How successful is Ukraine’s ‘gas war’ against Russia?,"news, russia-ukraine war, europe, russia, ukraine","Kyiv, Ukraine – When Russia annexed Crimea in 2014, Moscow promised the residents of the Black Sea peninsula higher salaries, better hospitals and retrofitted infrastructure. But 11 years later, they are learning to live with almost daily Ukrainian drone and missile attacks, unpredictable blackouts and a growing shortage of gasoline. Recommended Stories list of 4 items end of list “Every day I see cars that ran out of fuel and were left on the curb,” Ayder, a resident of Simferopol, Crimea’s administrative capital, told Al Jazeera. His car runs on natural gas, which is more available these days. “There are long lines and fistfights at gas stations” after a limit of 20 litres (5.3 gallons) per car was introduced, he said, withholding his last name out of fear of punishment for talking to foreign media. The shortage has been caused by a months-long Ukrainian campaign to destroy or damage Russian oil refineries, pipelines, pumping stations, terminals, fuel depots and even tankers of the so-called “ shadow fleet ” that transports crude despite Western sanctions. Early on Monday, Ukrainian drones hit five reservoirs of the oil terminal in the Crimean port of Feodosiya, causing a huge fire and a sky-high plume of putrid smoke – and damaging two power transmission stations. ‘Ukrainian forces chose a weak spot’ Kyiv’s campaign involves increasingly sophisticated, Ukrainian-made drones and missiles. It has reduced the output of oil refineries by up to a fifth, hurting Russia’s economy and upsetting President Vladimir Putin’s allies who control oil-related businesses. “The enemy’s gas deficit is up to 20 percent of their needs,” Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said on October 8. “Ukrainian forces chose a weak spot, identified it and methodically hit the spot,” Volydymyr Fesenko, head of the Kyiv-based Penta think tank, told Al Jazeera. “This is one of the ways to force Russia to start peaceful negotiations.” It also has a psychological downside. Each refinery is a mammoth maze of distillation columns, tanks, kilometres-long pipes and sizeable fuel depots that are hard to protect with air defence systems – and easy to ignite. If an attack on any of them succeeds, it causes hours or even days-long fires – and much longer pauses in oil refining. “We’re feeling down already. Awaiting a universal f*** up,” Valentin, a resident of the western Ryazan region, told Al Jazeera. He also withheld his last name, fearing reprisal for talking to media. Valentin saw or heard all six drone attacks this year on the Ryazan oil refinery that processes 18 million tonnes of oil annually, or 6.9 percent of Russia’s total output. The refinery belongs to the Rosneft oil company controlled by Igor Sechin, a former Portuguese translator and Putin’s lifelong friend. Oil refineries are a legitimate military target, according to Ihor Romanenko, former deputy head of Ukraine’s general staff of armed forces. “Fuel and lubricants are the blood of Russia’s logistical supply. Weaponry and [military] equipment need plenty of fuel and lubricant components,” he told Al Jazeera. Ukraine mostly relies on its own drones and rockets, as United States President Donald Trump is still mulling the supply of the advanced Tomahawk missiles , he said. At preliminary talks in Turkiye’s Istanbul, Moscow already urged Kyiv to stop hitting the refineries. But Kyiv insisted on broader limitations such as the complete cessation of air attacks – something Moscow refuses to do. “They wanted [us] to stop what is sensitive to them,” Romanenko said. At least 21 out of Russia’s 38 key refineries have been hit and partially damaged in 2025, according to media reports. Some facilities have been struck several times, causing weeks-long pauses in operation and panic among people living nearby. “Where the hell is air defence, are you going to down [the drones] with a slingshot?” a man yelled while recently filming a video on his phone of a drone attack on the Kirishi oil refinery, which processes 17.5 million tonnes of oil annually, or 6.6 percent of Russia’s output, outside St Petersburg. The attacks peaked in September, a month during which there were 40 strikes, according to analysis by Re: Russia, an online project by exiled Russian analysts that was published on October 8. Gas production throughout Russia fell by up to 27 percent, it said, causing shortages, price hikes and the deterioration of fuel quality. And while Crimea’s fuel depots are a relatively easy target, Ukrainian drones reach far beyond the Ural Mountains – a border between Russia’s European and Asian parts. During World War II, dozens of Soviet military plants were transferred to the Ural Mountains as Nazi German aircraft could not reach them. Eight decades later, Ukrainian drones can. On October 7, they hit a refinery in the western Siberian city of Tyumen, 2,000km (1,240 miles) from the Ukrainian border, surpassing their previous “record” by some 400km (250 miles). But Nikolay Mitrokhin of Germany’s Bremen University said the overall damage to the Russian economy from the drone attacks “amounts to a couple of percent” while some Ukrainian and European budgets suffer “irreparable damage” as the attacks are costly. And without directly influencing ongoing hostilities on the ground, the drone offensive triggers Russian retaliatory assaults on Ukraine’s hydrocarbon mining and refining facilities, energy infrastructure and railroad transport, he said. On October 10 , a huge Russian drone and missile attack struck two Ukrainian thermal power stations in Kyiv, causing an hours-long blackout. “It was a straight hit, there’s nothing left to repair,” Mykola Svyrydenko, who lives next to Thermal Power Station 5 in central Kyiv, told Al Jazeera.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/15/how-successful-is-ukraines-gas-war-against-russia,World,BBC,Mansur Mirovalev,https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2025-10-02T083107Z_1441757900_RC2I3HA6YJRM_RTRMADP_3_UKRAINE-CRISIS-RUSSIA-FUEL-1760443756.jpg?resize=1920%2C1440,,5647dcd6c4ae303bf24be95dccb005eb3835830d

The Gaza ceasefire agreement signed on Monday, along with an exchange of captives between Israel and Hamas, did nothing to diminish the resolve of about 10,000 protesters who descended on the small city in Italy’s far northeast, a small section of whom were involved in unrest at the end of the march. More than 1,000 police officers and army personnel were deployed on Tuesday, with helicopters and drones flying overhead to keep watch on a demonstration near the Bluenergy Stadium, where the Group I fixture was held, and was won 3-0 by Italy. There was little chance of protesters reaching the stadium, as checkpoints were set up in a ring around it, with spectators required to pass concrete barriers and metal detectors to watch a match – key to Italy’s bid to qualify for a World Cup for the first time since 2014. There is anger in Italy over the country’s football federation (FIGC) refusing to consider a boycott of matches against Israel. “The Norwegian FA has begun taking a position against the presence of Israeli teams; there’s a totally different type of behaviour across the board compared to what you see here in Italy,” said Carlina, an activist from Udine Committee for Palestine who helped organise the march. A large section of Italian fans in a small crowd of 10,000 loudly booed the Israeli national anthem before being drowned out by applause. There was further applause when Mateo Retegui put Italy ahead from the penalty spot in stoppage time at the end of the first half, and he ensured Italy at least second place in the group and a playoff spot with a beautiful curling finish in the 74th minute, before Gianluca Mancini headed in the third goal late on. Only the top spot offers automatic qualification for next year’s finals in the US, Canada, and Mexico, and Norway lead Italy by three points and a vastly superior goal difference with two matches remaining.",https://www.aljazeera.com/gallery/2025/10/15/people-march-in-italy-demanding-israel-boycott-before-world-cup-qualifier,World,BBC,,https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/AP25287550327079-1760513118.jpg?resize=1920%2C1440,,478af8f1fd61d8ce28cab26d74a2d74f22f45cd7

Both sides accused the other of triggering the deadly violence overnight Tuesday that spanned southeastern Afghanistan’s Spin Boldak district and Pakistan’s Chaman district. Recommended Stories list of 3 items end of list In a post on X, Afghan Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid accused Pakistani forces of initiating the border fighting by firing “light and heavy weapons” at Afghanistan, killing 12 civilians and injuring more than 100. Ali Mohammad Haqmal, a press spokesman in Spin Boldak district, put the civilian death toll at 15. The AFP news agency quoted a district hospital official as saying 80 women and children are among the wounded. Mujahid claimed Afghani forces returned fire, killing “a large number” of Pakistani soldiers, seizing Pakistani weapons and tanks and destroying Pakistani military installations. But Pakistani authorities blamed the Afghan Taliban for first firing on a Pakistani military post and other areas near the border, causing the clashes that also wounded four of its own civilians. The Reuters news agency quoted unnamed security officials as saying six Pakistani soldiers were killed in the violence, which one official said lasted around five hours. Najibullah Khan, a resident of Pakistan’s Chaman district, said the clashes forced some people living near the border to flee. “People are in a very difficult situation. Shells are falling in people’s homes,” he said. Pakistan’s army In a statement, Pakistan’s army said its forces had “effectively repulsed” the attack from Afghanistan’s Taliban, killing from 15 to 20 of their members and injuring others. It also said it had repelled separate Afghan Taliban attacks earlier in the night in Kurram district further north. “The insinuations that the attack was initiated by Pakistan, are outrageous and blatant lies, just like the claims of capturing Pakistani posts or equipment,” said the military statement. “The Armed Forces stand resolute and fully prepared to defend the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Pakistan.” Al Jazeera’s Kamal Hyder, reporting from the Torkham crossing on the border between Afghanistan and Pakistan, called the latest fighting a “serious escalation” that threatens to “lead to something much bigger”. “The population on both sides are wary of the new round of escalations,” Hyder said. The conflict had subsided as of 05:30 GMT, according to Afghanistan’s Taliban. Tensions between Afghanistan and Pakistan have been especially fraught since Saturday, when both sides traded fire across multiple border regions , resulting in dozens of casualties on each side. Although the clashes halted on Sunday after appeals from Saudi Arabia and Qatar, most border crossings between Pakistan and Afghanistan have remained closed. Over the weekend, Kabul said that in retaliation for what it called repeated violations of Afghan territory and airspace, it targeted several Pakistani military posts and killed 58 Pakistani soldiers. Pakistan’s military reported lower figures, saying it lost 23 soldiers and killed more than 200 “Taliban and affiliated terrorists” in retaliatory fire along the frontier. Pakistan accuses Kabul of harbouring fighters with the Taliban-allied Pakistan Taliban, known by the acronym TTP, which has carried out numerous deadly attacks in Pakistan. Kabul denies the charge, saying it does not allow its territory to be used against other countries. Tensions between the two states have also been amplified by a recent visit by Afghani Foreign Minister Amir Khan Muttaqi to Pakistan’s rival India , a trip Islamabad has “taken strong note of”, said Al Jazeera’s Hyder. Muttaqi addressed Pakistan-Afghanistan relations during a press conference in India, saying while both countries want a positive relationship, “there are certain groups in Pakistan that are trying to stir up unrest”.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/15/dozens-killed-injured-in-new-pakistan-afghanistan-border-clashes,World,BBC,Stephen Quillen,https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/AFP__20251015__78UA9G3__v1__HighRes__PakistanAfghanistanUnrest-1760511253.jpg?resize=1920%2C1440,,4e4dad0ae96a4336ce36edf22b1457709b0d2880

The US Treasury Department on Tuesday said it had taken what it described as the largest action ever in Southeast Asia, targeting 146 people within the Cambodia-based Prince Group network, which it declared a transnational criminal organisation. Recommended Stories list of 3 items end of list The UK also slapped sanctions on six entities and individuals associated with the Prince Group, freezing 19 London properties worth more than 100 million pounds ($134m) linked to the network. “Today’s action represents one of the most significant strikes ever against the global scourge of human trafficking and cyber-enabled financial fraud,” said US Attorney General Pam Bondi. Federal prosecutors in the US also unsealed an indictment charging Chinese-Cambodian tycoon Chen Zhi, the Prince Group’s 37-year-old chair, on charges of wire fraud and money laundering conspiracy. Chen, who is known as Vincent and remains at large, faces up to 40 years in prison if convicted on the charges. The US Justice Department also filed the largest forfeiture action in its history against the group, seizing Bitcoin worth more than $14bn at current prices. ‘Pig-butchering’ scams Chen was the “mastermind behind a sprawling cyberfraud empire”, Assistant Attorney General John Eisenberg said, with US Attorney Joseph Nocella describing the network’s operations as “one of the largest investment fraud operations in history”. The group is accused of running a network of purpose-built scam centres that functioned as forced labour camps across Cambodia, Myanmar and other countries in the region, where workers – many of them Chinese – were lured through fake job advertisements. The trafficked workers were then held against their will at the compounds and forced, under threat of torture, to carry out online fraud against victims around the world. The so-called “pig butchering” scams often involved the trafficked workers luring their targets into fake romantic relationships online, before persuading them to invest large sums into fraudulent cryptocurrency platforms. Private jets and a Picasso The defrauded funds were laundered in part through the Prince Group’s own gambling and cryptocurrency mining operations. The stolen money financed luxury purchases, including yachts, private jets, vacation homes and a Picasso painting bought at a New York auction house, authorities said. At one point, prosecutors said, Chen bragged that the scam was pulling in $30m a day. Since about 2015, Prince Group has operated across more than 30 countries under the guise of legitimate real estate, financial services and consumer businesses, prosecutors said, with Chen and fellow executives allegedly using political influence and bribery in multiple countries to protect the operation. Suspects with their hands ziptied after being detained during a raid on a scam centre in Phnom Penh in July [File: Pool / AFP] Jacob Daniel Sims, a transnational crime expert and visiting fellow at Harvard University’s Asia Center, told The Associated Press news agency that Prince Group was “an essential part of the scaffolding that makes global cyber-scamming possible”. Chen, he said, was a “central pillar” of the criminal economy intertwined with Cambodia’s ruling regime, having served as an adviser to Prime Minister Hun Manet and his father, former Prime Minister Hun Sen. “While the indictment and sanctions don’t instantly dismantle these networks, they fundamentally change the risk calculus,” Sims said. They make “every global bank, real estate firm and investor think twice before touching Cambodian elite money”. Announcing the sanctions, British Foreign Minister Yvette Cooper said the fraud network was enriching itself while destroying lives around the world. “The masterminds behind these horrific scam centres are ruining the lives of vulnerable people and buying up London homes to store their money,” she said. In 2023, the United Nations estimated about 100,000 people were being forced to carry out online scams in Cambodia , as well as at least 120,000 in Myanmar and tens of thousands in Thailand, Laos and the Philippines. In September, the UN warned that East Timor was becoming a new hotspot for scams.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/15/us-uk-sanction-huge-southeast-asian-crypto-scam-network,World,BBC,Tim Hume,https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/AFP__20251015__78U73WF__v1__HighRes__CambodiaUsScamsFraud-1760510277.jpg?resize=1920%2C1440,,00db96ab074100d3947bec7b8aaedd341878118c

For months, Maryland resident Noor Al-Khaled has struggled to create an online account with the Social Security Administration. Al-Khaled, who lives with the rare cranio-facial condition Ablepheron Macrostomia , says having an online account would allow her to easily access SSA records and quickly send documents to the agency. “I don’t drive because of my vision; I should be able to rely on the site,” Al-Khaled says. “You have to take a selfie, and the pictures have to match,” Al-Khaled says. “Because of the facial difference, I don't know if it’s not recognizing the ID or the selfie, but it’s always saying images don’t match.” Not having that access makes life harder. “On an emotional level, it just makes me feel shut out from society,” she explains. Al-Khaled says that all services should provide alternative ways for people to access online systems. “The lack of other fallback options means that sometimes people get trapped in these labyrinths of technological systems,” says Byrum from Present Moment Enterprises. An SSA spokesperson says alternative options to face verification are available, and it is “committed” to making its services accessible to everyone. The agency, the spokesperson says, does not run facial recognition systems itself but uses Login.gov and ID.me for verification services. The General Services Administration, which runs Login.gov, did not respond to WIRED’s request for comment. “Accessibility is a core priority for ID.me,” a spokesperson for ID.me says, adding it has previously helped people with facial differences and offered to directly help Al-Khaled after WIRED was in touch. “There are few things more dehumanizing than being told by a machine that you’re not real because of your face,” says Corey R. Taylor , a New York–based actor and motivational speaker who lives with a craniofacial anomaly. Last year, Taylor says, he was using a financial app to access a small amount of money; as he tried to complete the payment processes, he found that the face verification system could not match his selfie to the image on his ID. To get the system to work, he had to move into different positions. “I had to literally raise my eyes and contort my face,” Taylor says.

1f046707f553,Waymo's Robotaxis Are Coming to London,"self-driving cars, google, autonomous vehicles, uber, robotaxis, waymo","Waymo is expanding to London, the self-driving vehicle developer announced on Wednesday. The Google sister company aims to start service next year, when the UK government plans to allow autonomous vehicles to begin operating on its roads in limited pilot programs. Waymo says it’s working with the government to receive the necessary permissions for its launch. This is only Waymo ’s second venture outside the United States—though could be its first international robotaxi service. The company has been testing robotaxis in Tokyo since April , where it works with Japanese taxi company Nihon Kotsu, whose drivers are helping Waymo map and collect driving data from the city, and Japanese ride-hail firm GO. But the company won’t say when, or if, it plans to launch autonomous taxis in Japan. London could prove the company’s biggest challenge yet. Unlike more car-oriented cities in the US, London’s streets are more winding and narrow, the city's layout a legacy of its pre-Roman and medieval history. “We will take the same rigorous approach to testing and deploying in London as we have in other cities before offering rides to the public,” Waymo spokesperson Ethan Teicher wrote in an email. He says Waymo’s experience in Tokyo will help its software drive in London. Waymo operates paid taxi service in five US cities: Phoenix, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Austin, and Atlanta. (It operates the latter two services through the Uber app.) It has announced plans to launch in Dallas, Miami, Washington, DC, and Nashville next year. It has also received a permit to test autonomous vehicles in New York City, though must do so with a safety driver behind the wheel. The company says it has provided more than ten million paid rides since it picked up its first customers in 2020. Waymo’s move follows the UK government’s announcement this spring that it would accelerate by more than a year its plans to allow autonomous vehicle tech on public roads. The government now aims to begin permitting robotaxis to operate in small numbers starting in 2026. Government officials intend to spend about a year studying the data those vehicles produce before allowing companies to more widely launch driverless taxi services in the second half 2027. Homegrown British autonomous vehicle developer Wayve has already announced it will work with Uber to operate robotaxis in London. UK Secretary of State for Transport Heidi Alexander said in a statement that she was “delighted” about Waymo’s plans. “Boosting the [autonomous vehicle] sector will increase accessible transport options alongside bringing jobs, investment, and opportunities to the UK,” she said. Waymo says it will work with fleet operations firm Moove to run an eventual London fleet. Moove will help manage and dispatch Waymo’s electric ride-hail vehicles, and will maintain and operate the service’s maintenance and charging depots.

Hosted by “What’s Trending” CEO Shira Lazar , the Creator Upfronts featured Callum McGinley aka “Callux” and Ben Doyle aka “Rvbberduck” from After Party Studios, followed by Sean Atkins from Dhar Mann Studios and Kudzi Chikumbu, Tubi ‘s VP of creator partnerships. Callux and Rvbberduck were joined on stage by Nella Rose, a hugely popular YouTuber and presenter who previously took part in the U.K. reality series “I’m A Celebrity Get Me Out of Here” and has over 4 million followers across TikTok, Instagram and YouTube. Rose announced her new show “The Nella Rose Show,” which After Party Studios will be producing and pitching to potential broadcasting and streaming partners. It wasn’t the first time the Cannes-set television market gave an in-depth look at the digital creation biz. A decade ago, as Mipcom boss Lucy Smith reminded the audience during her introduction, the conference hosted the Mip Digital Upfront, a one-off initiative she said was “well received, but felt a bit premature for the market.” The creator economy is now “shaping the future of entertainment” and there are more and more partnerships with traditional media, as illustrated by BBC Studios’ recent deal with YouTube discussed on Monday by BBC Studios digital SVP Jasmine Dawson and YouTube’s EMEA boss Pedro Pina. During the After Party session, Rvbberduck said he met Callux in 2015 on a KFC campaign called “Around the World in 99 Gigs,” where he noticed a disconnect between what the client wanted from Callux, which was an “entertainment format that was essentially a long form chicken advert,” and what the director aspired to do, which was to do “crazy stuff” with an audience in mind. “When we landed back in London, we decided to start our own studios to bridge the gap between mainstream and digital,” Callux said, and “become the No. 1 producers of the internet’s most culturally relevant content.” “We did this by thinking like a creator,” he said. The company expanded to a team of over 30 people who “approach every project like they’re a creator,” which he argues is key because “these social platforms were built and sculpted by creators.” Ultimately, After Party Studios has succeeded in positioning themselves “neatly in this spot in the middle between creators, brands and commissioners,” Callux said. Some of the banner’s collaborations with broadcasters include the Channel 4.0 show “Hear Me Out” and the Sky Sports series “Scenes” for next-gen football fans. There’s still work to do to find a common ground in terms of tone and creative freedom. Rose spoke about her different experiences working for television on shows like “I’m a Celebrity Get Me Out of Here” and for digital media, emphasizing the fact that there’s still much more creative freedom in the digital space. “There’s a big difference with reality TV; it’s scripted from start to finish. And a lot of people don’t know that … Whereas in digital media, I could be 100% myself and my audience resonates way more with how I am actually in digital than on TV,” Rose said. Her next format, “The Nella Rose Show,” which After Party Studios is developing independently, will look to capture her unhinged spontaneity even if it will be pitched to broadcasters down the line. Over at Dhar Mann Studios, Atkins talked about how the company, which specializes in inspirational scripted long-form content, has become one of the largest creators on Facebook and YouTube, boasting 143 million global followers. He said “the good thing about storytelling is that it’s pretty universal, particularly with what we do which is all on human emotions” and is “dealing with themes like acceptance or rejection inequality.” Atkins, who joined Dhar Mann Studios in 2024 and previously headed MTV as well as worked as chief digital officer at Discovery, said the banner has also thrived by having lean operations. He said Dhar Mann Studios produce five and a half hours of television shows every week with only nine crews, running about 18 hours a day, seven days a week. “If you stepped onto the lot, it would look like you’d stepped onto a Warner Bros. lot or you’ve gone to Pinewood here in the U.K. But in terms of how it works compared to kind of traditional media, it’s just much more lean and much more efficient because that’s what the economics require,” Atkins said. “It’s like, you want to make a feature film, you need thousands of people. If you want to make a broadcast television show, you need 100 people. To make a cable show, you need tens. And if you want to make a digital show, one. It’s just an exponential curve.” Atkins also talked about the revenue model for Dhar Mann Studios, which he says comes from different sources. One of them is basic revenue sharing, where the creator receives approximately half of the money generated by across six platforms; the second is brand deals, which are actually more lucrative for creators and represent approximately 50% to 60% of their revenue; and then the ancillary business development where Dhar Mann Studios works with its agency, Fifth Order, to help creators manage their assets. The Upfronts concluded with a discussion around distribution with Tubi’s Chikumbu, who said the AVOD service was an attractive destination for creators because of its powerful reach. “We’ve grown an audience of fans to over 100 million monthly active users, a lot of them are Gen Z and millennials,” he pointed out. The executive said 70% of them “want content from independent filmmakers, but also from creators.” So far, Tubi boasts a large library of “almost 300,000 episodes and a really strong recommendation system” and the platform’s ultimate goal is to build a “creatorverse.” “[It’s] a place where creators can have a path to Hollywood but also retain their authentic creativity,” Chikumbu said. Lazar, who hosted the Mip Digital Upfront 10 years ago, told Variety in a post-mortem chat that the showcase gave “three perspectives” on the sector. She noted that After Party Studios is “a creator-founded company” that is “partnering with other creators, launching shows on their platforms that they fund it in a cost-efficient way, then finding other distribution deals or deciding then to leverage the popularity to get some deals,” whereas Dhar Mann Studios was built around the personality of its creator and has expanded into a production powerhouse. “He’s not just doing it for his own platform, but doing it for others, creating other formats with talents, and doing scripted and long-form in a successful way and monetizing as well,” Lazar said. On the distribution side, meanwhile, Tubi illustrates how “streamers are doing these partnerships with creators with their archive and library, similar to how traditional media did it,” she continued. At this year’s Mipcom, a number of collaborations with traditional media companies have been announced, including Banijay ‘s partnership with YouTube to launch an Entertainment Creators Lab in France and its acquisition of a majority stake in Dutch label Werktitel.",https://variety.com/2025/tv/global/creator-economy-upfronts-mipcom-after-party-dhar-mann-tubi-1236552566,Entertainment,BBC,Elsa Keslassy,https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/FotoJet-37.jpg?w=1000&h=563&crop=1,2025-10-15T09:30:55+00:00,562271f0884da1006b554e77ce7ae6d973eb571d
405055be4078,Bruce Springsteen Hails Stephen Graham’s Portrayal of His ‘Troubled’ Father in ‘Deliver Me From Nowhere’: He ‘Just Naturally Inhabited His Skin’,,"The accolades are stacking up for Stephen Graham . Less than a month after winning his first Emmy for “Adolescence,” the British actor has now received high praise from The Boss, with Bruce Springsteen hailing his performance in “Springsteen: Delivery Me From Nowhere.” Graham plays Douglas Springsteen in the Searchlight biopic directed by Scott Cooper, starring alongside Jeremy Allen White as the rocker during the making of his 1992 album “Nebraska.” Speaking at a special Q&A at Spotify’s London headquarters with White, Springsteen claimed that Graham “really embodied the physicality emotional complexity of my father,” with whom he acknowledged he had a deeply complicated relationship. “He was very troubled, an alcoholic, bipolar and quite mentally ill,” he said. “Stephen just naturally inhabited his skin and his soul, particular as an older man — he’s the spitting image of him!” Springsteen added: “Towards the end of the film, you get a sense of my father’s invulnerability and his sweetness.” White, meanwhile, noted that he learned to play the guitar using a rare 1955 Gibson J200, gifted to him by Springsteen while he prepared for role. “That became the guitar in the film,” he said. White also admitted to bringing a jump rope to set, having mistakenly thought he’d need it to keep his heart rate up and sweat flowing between takes on the performance scenes. “For some reason I thought my stamina would be more than Bruce’s,” he said. “It turns out it was completely unnecessary — that sweat comes naturally, that heart rate gets lifted and the adrenaline gets going. So I didn’t need to use it — Bruce-level energy comes naturally when you’re up there.”",https://variety.com/2025/film/global/bruce-springsteen-hails-stephen-graham-in-biopic-1236553262,Entertainment,BBC,Alex Ritman,https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Bruce-Springsteen007.jpg?w=1000&h=563&crop=1,2025-10-15T09:26:29+00:00,f93df69e54a1a77bcaa923b747a54784bb4a9bfd
448134e57b1d,"Doha Film Festival Unveils Competition Lineup, With Emphasis on Gaza and Regional Fare",,"The upcoming Doha Film Festival has unveiled its competition lineup, characterized by a strong regional component and an accent on the Palestinian plight. As previously announced, the Middle East premiere of Tunisian director Kaouther Ben Hania’s politically charged drama “ The Voice of Hind Rajab ” is set as the out-of-competition opener of the event’s inaugural edition, which will run Nov. 20–28 in the Qatari capital. “The Voice of Hind Rajab,” which tells the true story of a 5-year-old Palestinian girl who was stranded in a car that was attacked by Israeli forces in Gaza and later found dead, recently won Venice Film Festival’s Silver Lion Grand Jury Prize. The film is supported by the Doha Film Institute (DFI), as are most titles in the Doha Film Festival’s 13-title competition. Also featuring Palestine are Doha fest competition entries “Once Upon a Time in Gaza,” directed by Palestinian directorial duo Tarzan and Arab Nasser, which world premiered in Cannes’ Un Certain Regard and won the best directing prize; and Kamal Aljafari’s doc “With Hasan in Gaza,” that premiered in competition in Locarno. Other standout titles in the competition strand include “The President’s Cake” from Iraqi filmmaker Hasan Hadi, about a young school girl chosen to bake a celebratory dessert in observation of Saddam Hussein’s birthday, which won this year’s Cannes Camera d’Or award; “Khartotum,” the potent doc about five residents forced to flee the Sudanese capital’s conflict that launched from Sundance; and Iranian director Ali Asgari’s dark comedy about Iranian film censorship, “Divine Comedy.” “These powerful artistic expressions represent the creativity and resilience of humanity and demonstrate the capability of film to shape the future of our societies,” said  Doha Film Institute CEO Fatma Hassan Alremaihi in a statement. “Through these stories that engage empathy, reflection and connection, we are creating safe spaces for meaningful dialogue to counter prevailing narratives.” Just as the tiny Arab state, rich in oil and gas, diversifies from the energy sector into cultural and media and entertainment — as attested by broadcaster Al Jazeera and the 2022 FIFA World Cup soccer tournament — the DFI has steadily grown into a crucial cornerstone of the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region film industry. The upcoming Doha Film Festival transforms the DFI’s existing Ajyal Film Festival, dedicated to youth and family-friendly cinema, into a more ambitious international event for a broader audience. It will have four competition strands: international feature film competition, short film competition, the Ajyal film competition (judged by the festival’s unique youth jury) and the Made in Qatar competition, dedicated to projects made in Qatar regardless of the director’s provenance. The top prizes to be dished out will be best narrative, worth $75,000; documentary, worth $50,000; artistic achievement, worth $45,000; and the gender-neutral performance acting award, worth $15,000. The new festival will take place in various locations across Doha including the Katara Cultural Village, Msheireb Downtown Doha and the Museum of Islamic Art.

56f3a67df8d2,Square Eyes Acquires ‘The Kartli Kingdom’ Ahead of IDFA World Premiere (EXCLUSIVE),,"Vienna-based sales outlet Square Eyes has secured international rights to “The Kartli Kingdom,” directed by Tamar Kalandadze and Julien Pebrel. The film is set to world premiere in the International Competition at the International Documentary Festival Amsterdam ( IDFA ), taking place Nov. 13-23. “Kartli” refers both to Georgia’s medieval kingdom and a Tbilisi sanatorium sheltering refugees from the 1990s war in Abkhazia, meant as temporary but lasting 30 years. The collapsing building became a recreated “country”: a farm, garden, terraces, and rooms where old VHS tapes revive memories of Abkhazia, their lost paradise. Through Tamuna, Irma and others, the film reveals the exile’s trauma and shared resilience. Even if time seems frozen in Kartli’s walls, nothing stays the same. “Our film narrates a community’s story through the shelter of Kartli: past, present and imagined future, lending gentleness, violence, sadness, memories, and humor,” Kalandadze and Pebrel commented. “These layers of time merge in editing, combining image and sound materials. Memories, words and tales of Kartli’s past shape its inhabitants’ lives, forming foundational myths. These stories, like an underground stream, resurface during conversations, interrupting scenes we filmed. Archival footage adds bursts of collective memory, showing the 1992 war’s impact on the community.” “We love how the film gives us a glimpse inside the walls of the Kartli sanatorium, where the collective memory of the 1992 war in Abkhazia and the current lives of the residents mix into a touching and poetic documentary,” stated Wouter Jansen, CEO of Square Eyes. “The mix of these two narratives makes the film a perfect match for our catalog.” “The Kartli Kingdom” is produced by Ketevan Kipiani for Giorgia’s Sakdoc Film and Jean-Baptiste Bonnet for Habilis Productions in France.

Nestled in the Johar Valley and surrounded by Himalayan peaks, the most notable being Nanda Devi, once considered the tallest mountain in the world, this village had traded sugar, lentils, spices, and cloth for salt and wool with Tibetans across the border. The nomadic inhabitants of several villages spent the winter months in the plains gathering goods to be traded with Tibetans in the summer. However, the border was sealed following an armed conflict between India and China in 1962, disrupting life in the high villages and leaving people with little incentive to return. Kishan Singh, 77, was 14 when he left with his family to settle in the lower village of Thal. He still returns to Martoli every summer to till the land and cultivate buckwheat, strawberries, and black cumin. His ancestral home has no roof, so he sleeps in a neighbour’s abandoned house during the six months he spends in this village. “I enjoy being in the mountains and the land here is very fertile,” he says. In late autumn, he hires mules to transport his harvest to his home in the plains, where he sells it at a modest profit. The largest of the Johar Valley villages had about 1,500 people at its peak in the early 1960s. Martoli had about 500 residents then, while some of the dozen or so other villages had 10 to 15 homes each. Now, only three or four people return to Martoli each summer. A few villagers are returning in summer to the nearby villages of Laspa, Ghanghar, and Rilkot, as they can now travel by vehicle to within a few kilometres (miles) of their villages on a recently built unpaved road. Among the scattered remnants of earlier stone houses in Martoli, a new guesthouse has appeared to cater for a few trekkers who pass through the village en route to the Nanda Devi Base Camp.",https://www.aljazeera.com/gallery/2025/10/15/life-slowly-returning-to-abandoned-himalayan-villages-in-india,World,BBC,,https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/AP25287262314540-1760515341.jpg?resize=1920%2C1440,,c20b51719ec055aac5e32dc34b4d6e3e8075d5ff

a5ce244ec206,We were wrong about how the moon's largest and oldest crater formed — and that's great news for NASA's next lunar landing,,"The largest and oldest crater on the moon did not form as we initially suspected, a new study suggests. The findings hint that a specific region of the lunar surface could be more scientifically interesting than we thought — with big implications for NASA 's upcoming Artemis missions , which are scheduled to land astronauts within this newly realized area of interest as soon as 2027. The moon formed around 4.46 billion years ago , when an ancient Mars-size protoplanet, known as Theia, collided with Earth, creating a giant cloud of debris that combined into a large spherical satellite orbiting our planet. For the next 200 million years or so, the lunar surface was covered by a hellish magma ocean , as a result of gravitational squeezing from Earth. But as the moon moved farther away from our planet, the molten rock eventually cooled and crystalized, forming an outer rocky crust that has remained largely unchanged ever since — aside from a near-constant bombardment of space rocks . Shortly after the moon cooled off, around 4.3 billion years ago, an asteroid more than 10 times wider than the one that wiped out the dinosaurs slammed into what is now the satellite's permanent far side . This birthed the South Pole-Aitken (SPA) basin , a giant impact crater around 1,550 miles (2,500 kilometers) across and up to 5 miles (8 km) deep. Researchers believe that this extreme impact may have ejected a mix of radioactive material, dubbed ""potassium, rare earth elements and phosphorus"" or KREEP, that was left over from the past magma ocean. (The chemical symbol for potassium is K, hence the name KREEP.) KREEP is believed to have formed during the final cooling phase of the moon , when radioactive elements built up in the space between the moon's newly formed mantle and crust. Studying these elements more closely could help shed light on several mysteries surrounding this period of lunar evolution, including why the crust on the moon's far side is thicker than its visible near side . Until now, researchers believed that the SPA basin was formed by an asteroid impacting the moon from the south, which would have splashed a layer of KREEP around the crater's northern rim. However, in a new study, published Oct. 8 in the journal Nature , researchers found that the impact actually occurred from the north, meaning that the resulting KREEP is plastered around the southern edge of the crater — right where the crewed Artemis III mission is scheduled to land. This photo, taken by the Apollo 8 astronauts in December 1968, shows the lunar mountains surrounding the northern rim of the South Pole-Aitken basin. (Image credit: NASA) ""This means that the Artemis missions will be landing on the down-range rim of the basin — the best place to study the largest and oldest impact basin on the moon,"" study lead author Jeffrey Andrews-Hanna , a planetary scientist at the University of Arizona, said in a statement . This is ""where most of the ejecta, material from deep within the moon's interior, should be piled up,"" he added. The researchers became suspicious of the SPA basin's true origins when they compared its shape to other impact craters in the solar system , including Mars' Hellas basin and Pluto's Sputnik basin. All three craters have a similar shape, with one rounded end and another more pointed, making them look somewhat like an avocado or teardrop. The pointed tip of these craters likely represents the direction of impact, enabling researchers to guess which way the SPA basin asteroid hit. Get the world’s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox. These suspicions were confirmed when the team analyzed data from the Lunar Prospector, a NASA spacecraft that orbited the moon from 1998 to 1999 and measured the radioactivity of surface elements. This revealed a high concentration of thorium — a radioactive element and key component of KREEP — around the crater's southwestern rim. Collecting KREEP-y samples The uncrewed Orion capsule of the Artemis I mission circled the moon for around two weeks in late 2022. (Image credit: NASA) The Artemis III mission, which aims to put humans on the moon for the first time since 1972, is currently scheduled for mid-2027, following the completion of the Artemis II mission, which is due to launch at some point before the end of April 2026. The initial mission will send a crewed spacecraft to orbit the moon, similar to the uncrewed Artemis I spacecraft, which successfully circled the moon in late 2022 . The Artemis III astronauts will land near the moon's south pole in one of nine potential sites, most of which lie inside the KREEP splash zone surrounding SPA, according to NASA . If they land in the right place, this could give the team the chance to collect valuable KREEP samples. However, there is some uncertainty about when Artemis III will actually launch. Both Artemis II and Artemis III have already been delayed several times . Historically high cuts proposed to NASA's 2026 budget have also led some experts to predict further delays, which may end up handing China the advantage in the race to return humans to the moon. China has also already acquired the first samples of the moon's far side, which were returned to Earth in June 2024 by the Chang'e 6 spacecraft, from inside the SPA basin. However, despite sharing the valuable lunar rocks with several other countries, NASA has not yet been allowed to anlayze these samples .

1074b239dba1,Diagnostic dilemma: A woman's nausea was triggered by a huge mass in her stomach — which doctors dissolved with diet soda,,"The patient: A 63-year-old woman in Massachusetts The symptoms: The patient went to the emergency department after experiencing nausea and vomiting for about a month, along with decreased appetite. She told doctors that she'd also experienced a burning pain in her upper abdomen and right side of her torso, which wrapped around to her back. She'd tried treating these symptoms with two common over-the-counter medications for acid reflux, but the treatments didn't help. In the year prior, the patient had started taking semaglutide, a type of drug known as a GLP-1 receptor agonist — the same class of drug as Ozempic. These injected drugs are used to treat type 2 diabetes and assist in chronic weight management; in this case, the woman had a history of type 2 diabetes and obesity. Since starting the medication, she'd lost about 40 pounds (18 kilograms), but notably, that weight loss had accelerated over the previous month, she noted. What happened next: Doctors took a CT scan of the patient's abdomen and pelvis. This revealed that the bile ducts, which move bile from the liver to the gallbladder and small intestine, were slightly dilated. The woman also had ""heavy stool burden"" but no signs of obstructions in her bowels, and her stomach was slightly stretched out due to carrying ""semisolid material."" To take a closer look, the medical team then used magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography, a noninvasive scan that examines the bile ducts, gallbladder, pancreas and pancreatic ducts. The scan confirmed that the bile ducts were dilated and revealed a mass in the stomach that appeared to be trapped air. The doctors then examined the upper digestive tract, from the esophagus to the top of the small intestine, with an endoscope. The diagnosis: The endoscopy revealed a large mass in the woman's stomach, known as a gastric bezoar . These masses are tightly packed blobs of partially digested or undigested materials. The treatment: Semaglutide and other GLP-1 agonists typically cause delayed gastric emptying, which means they slow the rate at which the stomach empties its contents into the intestines. The woman was taken off that medication upon hospital admission. Get the world’s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox. The next step with a bezoar is to try and dissolve the mass while it's still in the stomach — and evidence suggests a good way to do this is to give the patient soda. ""Existing evidence, largely from case series and anecdotal experiences, supports the administration of 3 liters [0.8 gallons] of cola, either orally or through a nasogastric tube, within a 12-hour window,"" doctors noted in a report of the case . ""It is not well understood whether acidity, carbonation , or another mechanism accounts for dissolution of the bezoar."" Due to the patient's history of diabetes, she was given diet cola. She also didn't enjoy carbonated beverages, so the typical prescription of 3 liters of soda was cut down to 1.5 liters (0.4 gallons). On the second day after starting this treatment, the patient noted a ""tugging"" sensation in her abdomen followed by relief of her nausea and abdominal discomfort. An endoscopic exam revealed that the bezoar was no longer stuck in her stomach. The woman then transitioned to a typical diet in the hospital, and by the time she was discharged, she had no nausea, vomiting or abdominal pain. She did not restart semaglutide but was prescribed acid reflux medication to take daily. She reported that her appetite increased after hospital discharge and her weight rebounded a bit over the following months. Her abdominal symptoms had not returned within a few months of discharge. What makes the case unique: Gastric bezoars are fairly rare, the report noted. They are found in less than 0.5% of endoscopies of the upper digestive tract. Common symptoms of the condition, such as pain, nausea, vomiting and abdominal discomfort, also appear in many more-common disorders, so they don't necessarily point to the presence of a bezoar in all cases. The most common type of gastric bezoar is formed of plant fibers and called a ""phytobezoar."" Eating lots of certain foods, such as persimmons, pineapples, raisins or celery, can raise the risk of phytobezoars because the plants contain a high concentration of indigestible components, such as cellulose, lignins and certain tannins. However, various medical conditions, procedures and drugs can also raise the risk of bezoars. These include anatomical changes related to bariatric or other gastric surgeries, autonomic nerve damage, and medications that cause delayed gastric emptying, such as GLP-1s. In the woman's case, semaglutide was likely to blame for her bezoar, and discontinuing the treatment helped resolve the problem. The cola she consumed also helped. Although that course of treatment sounds strange on paper, it is the preferred first-line treatment over using a scope to physically break up the bezoar in the patient's stomach. ""Bezoars formed from food material may be initially managed with oral administration of cola in patients in a clinically stable condition,"" the report said. ""This intervention is generally cost-effective and is associated with a lower risk of complications than invasive procedures.""

bc6200430a83,"USMNT's lingering questions: Forward battle now a good problem, Tyler Adams' backup, seeking 90 good minutes",,"The October international break was a job well done for the U.S. men's national team, who offered several signals that they are trending in the right direction with the World Cup just eight months away. While this month's games, a 1-1 draw against Ecuador and a 2-1 win over Australia , provided some answers on what head coach Maruicio Pochettino's tactical vision is and which players might be up for the task, there are naturally still some lingering questions as the countdown to the World Cup continues. Pochettino's version of the USMNT seem to be at their most comfortable building out of the back with three center backs, while an eclectic group of apparent World Cup starters rises to the top. Mainstays like Christian Pulisic -- who came off in the first half against Australia with an apparent hamstring injury -- Chris Richards and Tim Weah make up a group of regular starters that includes rising talent Malik Tillman, while Matt Freese and Tim Ream seem like the frontrunners in their respective positions. That still leaves a handful of berths up for grabs, though, and Pochettino admitted on Tuesday that the competition for roster spots is still ""open for every single USA player."" Given the circumstances, it comes as little surprise that the USMNT still do not look like the finished product and some unevenness against Ecuador and Australia demonstrated some clear areas for improvement regardless of the personnel on the pitch. It all sets up for a fascinating run as next summer's World Cup rapidly approaches, each of the U.S.' upcoming friendlies potentially revealing more and more about how Pochettino's team actually looks – and how far they can go. As the countdown to November's friendlies against Paraguay and Uruguay begins, here's a look at the lingering questions that still face the USMNT. Haji Wright, Cristian Roldan ace USMNT auditions, offer optimism for USA soccer eight months before World Cup Pardeep Cattry 1. Who starts in attack? It feels like the question of which of the USMNT's forwards would start transformed almost overnight from a hopeless plea into the ether to a near embarrassment of riches. For the first time in a long time, the U.S. may have two players gunning for a starting role, with both Folarin Balogun and Haji Wright each providing a compelling case for himself after combining for all three of the team's goals this month. Balogun has essentially been the starter-in-waiting, marred by an injury-plagued year but wasting no time with two goals and an assist in his last four games for the national team, bailing the team out against Ecuador on an encouraging but somewhat wasteful attacking outing from the group. Wright showcased his own creativity with a brace against Australia , meanwhile, his second goal in particular offering a glimpse at his individual talents as he created a chance for himself before scoring. If the two of them keep up this form, they are likely to make the World Cup roster but the division of playing time could be the most pressing question facing Pochettino in the final stages of his World Cup prep. Wright's success only makes Josh Sargent 's recent ventures with the national team more melancholic -- both are in remarkable form for their clubs and while Wright translated that into an impressive outing against Australia, Sargent's USMNT career is perhaps now defined by the fact that he is nearly six years removed from his last international goal. Sargent's ship may have sailed at this point but the one big unknown in terms of personnel is Ricardo Pepi, who scored in Pochettino's opening match with the U.S. a year ago but has also spent much of the time since injured. If Pepi returns to his pre-injury form timely, though, Pochettino will have one of those proverbial good problems on his hands. Can anyone replace Tyler Adams ? Tyler Adams missed the October friendlies for the birth of his second child, offering a genuine opportunity for someone to step up and at least make their case to be his indisputable understudy. It will come as little surprise that Adams is still the best player in the pool in his defensive midfield role but after the games against Ecuador and Australia, it is hard to argue that a standout candidate has emerged from the group. Tanner Tessman and James Sands each got a shot at the job, Tessman filling in against Ecuador next to Aidan Morris and Sands doing so against Australia alongside Cristian Roldan. Tessman had a better outing in this isolated comparison, Pochettino saying on Friday that ""the quality is there and the capacity to understand the game, the tactical way that we want to apply and set up [in] the game, the principles."" Sands, meanwhile, was one of the players notably caught ball-watching on Tuesday as the Socceroos scored first. Like in the forward roles, there is the idea that the oft-injured Johnny Cardoso could have a say in this competition and there's no real shame in admitting that Adams has staked full claim on his starting job. Building a World Cup roster is about preparing for less than ideal situations, though, and the fact that no go-to backup has emerged at the No. 6 position remains one of the USMNT's longest lasting unanswered questions, one that very much pre-dates Pochettino. When will the USMNT string together a complete performance? Slowly but surely, the USMNT are stitching together an encouraging and cohesive identity, but at this stage of their preparation, it feels more like patchwork than the finished product. Even if the positives may have outweighed the negatives in October, there is still some very obvious room for improvement – the fact that they have yet to string together a complete, 90 minute performance. Pochettino pointed to that as the obvious next step for his group, some sloppy moments costing them against Ecuador and Australia. The Socceroos in particular seemed to stump the USMNT in the opening half hour of the game, with Pochettino saying the group was just a little bit slow to make their moves at the start of Tuesday's win. ""One of the [ones] that we need to improve is to, [for] 90 minutes, try to be aggressive and to [be] more solid,"" Pochettino said. ""I think we start the game thinking too much, no? When you are on the pitch and you think too much, you start not to play in a natural way and always, it's late, you move the ball so slow. When you want to press, you arrive late and then when we concede, it's like a big relief. It's not anymore, the pressure. We need to start to play and I think the team start to play [with] more freedom and then we scored a fantastic goal and we equalize and then in the second half, we concede from a few actions in the beginning but in the end, the game was always under our control, but, I think, it's to improve and to try to dominate in a better way the game and that is the thing that we need to improve."" Cohesion feels like a natural sacrifice when experimentation is the priority but the USMNT have paid for virtually every mistake they have made in recent months, which is perhaps unlucky, but also a problem that seems solvable to a certain degree. How quickly they figure things out, though, just might be the greatest indicator of their World Cup success.",https://www.cbssports.com/soccer/news/usmnts-lingering-questions-forward-battle-now-a-good-problem-tyler-adams-backup-seeking-90-good-minutes,Sport,BBC,,https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2025/10/15/d0b14b2e-499f-4ab8-a1eb-88c27e1cb46d/thumbnail/1200x675/dd4149ef89c21921dc55a1201205976e/untitled-design-2025-10-15t120033-482.png,2025-10-15T10:03:00+00:00,ae82a0cb11d86fd3eedbc2fef6ee3a978ca2cf93

The 6-9 ATS record felt a lot worse, too. It just wasn't pretty. That brings my ATS record to 49-44 on the season -- still above .500 in a tough year -- and my straight-up record is now 66-26-1. It's not good. It's not bad. It just is. So let's hope the string of mediocrity changes this week. I do like the card, so let's go.

The seven-part half hour Spanish -drama comedy “Segunda Temporada (“Second Season”) commissioned by Filmin , reunites the hot creators of “Autodefensa,” which won best short format series at Series Mania 2024: director/writer Miguel Ángel Blanca (“Magaluf Ghost Town”), named a 2021 Spanish talent to watch by Variety andco-writersBerta Prieto and Víctor Diago. As in “Autodefensa,” made up of self-contained episodes and set in Barcelona, Prieto also stars in the title role, joined here by Adan Domínguez. We follow Paula, a once-celebrated literary prodigy now trying to rebuild her life amid Barcelona’s disoriented cultural scene of 2024. According to the logline, “surrounded by second-rate celebrities and fading fame, she navigates precarious jobs, creative burnout, and the relentless search for “the next big thing”. “The series captures the absurdities of post-fame existence while maintaining the authenticity and irreverence audiences loved in “‘Autodefensa,’” Oble says in a statement. Set to start filming next week, with delivery lined up for 2026, “Segunda Temporada” is produced by Barcelona’s Boogaloo Films (Locarno’s “Sorella di clausura”) in co-production with Spain-Portugal upscale SVOD service Filmin, creative outfit Canada and Oble. Meanwhile the tragi-comedy “How to Kill Your Sister” world premiered at Canneseries’ main competition to critical acclaim last April, before its roll out on Belgian streamer Streamz, Aug. 21 and commercial channel Play4 early September. Belgium’s FBO produces, in co-production with Germany’s MadeForFilm, a Banijay company, and ZDF Neo. Co-created and written by Pedro Elia (Control Pedro”) and Evelien Broekaert, the story turns on Anna (Emma Rotsaert) who shows up at her elder sister Kat’s doorstep with a coffin, after an eight-year absence, seeking answers to why her sister abandoned her following her parent’s death. One answer is Anna is just too much of a wild child for Kat to handle, who has settled for a submissive marriage to a toxic control freak. Anna latest excess is that she announces she is terminally ill and wants Kat (Marjan De Schutter) to come along on a last journey. Unfortunately, it’s true. The siblings embark on a hilariously dark road trip across Flanders and Spain. “I wanted extreme comedy and extreme drama, all in one show,” helmer and co-writer Geirnaert (“De Dag,” “Flatlife”) told Variety . For Oble, “How to Kill Your Sister” balances humor and tragedy with care and precision, offering a heartfelt, genuinely funny exploration of grief, forgiveness, and family, highlighted by standout performances from Marjan De Schutter ( Geldwolven, The Twelve ) and Emma Rotsaert.” Oble’s Mipcom slate is headlined by the Norwegian comedy “Nepobaby” from popular showrunner Henriette Steenstrup, sold by Oble to English-speaking territories CBC for CBC Gem in Canada and SBS in Australia ahead of the Cannes market, with Nordisk Film inking deals with TV2 Denmark and SVT Sweden. The show which won best screenplay and ensemble cast at Canneseries premieres Oct. 23 on TV2 Play in Norway. Rounding out Oble’s slate is the Netflix/RTS high-end period drama “Winter Palace” produced by Swiss-based Point Prod with Oble Studios. Speaking to Variety from the Palais des Festivals in Cannes, Oble co-founder Katia Sol said: “Mipcom is one of the biggest markets for content sales and all our meetings are packed.

f6fd204941f9,Natalie Portman Lights Up Lumière With Grace and Humor,,"Few moments at this week’s Lumière Film Festival drew as much fervor as Natalie Portman ’s masterclass. As one of this year’s guests of honor, the Oscar-winning actor held the packed Pathé Bellecour theater spellbound – poised, luminous and down-to-earth – with queues outside snaking for dozens of meters from those hoping for a last-minute seat. Over the course of the talk, she reflected on a career that has moved with ease between studio blockbusters and intimate auteur films, explaining that she founded her own production company “to create the movies that I want to see in the world, that I want to participate in.” “I didn’t grow up with much of a cinematic knowledge or appreciation,” she admitted with a laugh. “I was really seeing kind of mainstream movies. I grew up with “The Lion King,” “Mrs. Doubtfire,” “Dirty Dancing,” “Pretty Woman”… It was only after I started making films that I started learning about cinematic history.” That discovery came through the filmmakers she worked with, she said, who introduced her to directors such as John Cassavettes, Michael Haneke, Wong Kar-wai or Robert Bresson. From there, her taste and understanding of cinema expanded, feeding her career choices. Asked about the performers who inspired her, Portman spoke with admiration about of Gena Rowlands, Julianne Moore, Isabelle Huppert and Nicole Kidman. With great affection she cited Diane Keaton , who died on Oct. 11. “She gave female characters the opportunity to be as complex as the male characters we commonly see,” she said. “They were neurotic, they were funny, they were smart, they were emotional, they were weird. She let women be weird on screen. [She was] someone who was unapologetically herself, and you fell in love with her because of that.” The conversation then turned to her early years. Portman was only 12 when she made her first film, Luc Besson’s “Léon: The Professional,” and she recalled how naturally she took to acting. “It’s actually the most childlike thing to do,” she smiled. “You’re pretending. Being an actor is acting like a child all the time. All children are actors. (…) It’s part of natural human behavior.” Portman famously attended Harvard University after shooting “Star Wars: Episode I – The Phantom Menace” – “I’m from a very academic family and it was never a choice.” Asked whether studying psychology helped her better approach her characters, she drew a clear parallel. “I think it’s really the same practice,” she replied. “It’s the same question: why do people do what they do? What is someone feeling at any given moment? What are the interesting contradictory feelings that we have? Observation, observation, observation – watching people, noting behavior, and trying to understand why.” That same spirit of inquiry has defined her approach to researching her characters. Whether it was reading “millions of books” to play Anne Boleyn in “The Other Boleyn Girl,” watching “millions of videos and documentaries,” and listening to audio tapes for “Jackie,” or working on the troubled superstar character of Celeste for “Vox Lux.” Arco @ Remembers Mountain “When I had to learn what a K-hole looked like… I wasn’t going to do ketamine to learn that, so I went to YouTube,” she said with a smile, describing the platform as “a wonderful resource.” Portman was also keen to speak about her work as a producer and her interest in animation, mentioning her collaboration with French director Ugo Bienvenu on “Arco,” which picked up the top prize at the world’s biggest animation festival in Annecy and is out this week in France. She said she was struck by how horizontal and collaborative the animation world could be, with artists often moving fluidly between roles. Her admiration for collaborative leadership extended to her creative partners. Of “Black Swan” director Darren Aronofsky, she said: “He has such a confidence in his vision, but he’ll always take someone else’s good idea. That combination of confidence and humility – that’s what marks greatness.” Asked what was left of her cult character of Nina in “Black Swan,” Portman answered straight-faced, “I still do the butt exercises I learned while training” – before switching to French with a flash of humor and a wink to her French audience with perfect comic timing: “les exercices pour le derrière!” As the conversation came to a close, Portman was asked what advice she would give her 12-year-old self about to shoot “Léon” if she met her today. “Play, have fun,” she said simply. A retrospective of Portman’s work is screened at Lumière as part of her visit, featuring “Heat,” “V for Vendetta,” “Black Swan,” and “Jackie.” The Lumière Film Festival runs in Lyon until Oct. 19.",https://variety.com/2025/film/global/natalie-portman-lights-up-lumiere-grace-humor-1236553340,Entertainment,BBC,Lise Pedersen,https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/02-Natalie-Portman-Pathe-13_10-Chassignole.jpg?w=1000&h=563&crop=1,2025-10-15T10:28:24+00:00,28fd5072585976ecee119f19d726295190202101

Shot in a vast swathe of desert and in several Saudi cities and urban areas including Jeddah, Medina, AlUla and Neom, “Hijra” premiered positively in September in the Venice Film Festival’s Spotlight section. The film centers on 12-year-old Janna, who embarks on a journey toward Mecca to perform Hajj – the annual Islamic pilgrimage to Mecca – with her strict grandmother Sitti and rebellious 18-year-old sister Sarah. But before they reach their destination, Sarah disappears, forcing Janna and Sitti into a tense and urgent search. “Hijra” features an all-Saudi cast, comprising Khairia Nathmy as Sitti, Nawaf Al-Dhafiri, nd newcomer Lamar Fadan in the lead role of Janna, with Baraa Alem making a special guest appearance. “Representing my country at the Oscars for a second time is a profound honor and a reflection of the positive transformation in Saudi cinema,” Ameen said in a statement. “Hijra” was one of the most challenging projects of my career. We filmed in remote regions because we believed in the urgency of this story a tale of Saudi women across generations, told from the heart of our history to the world,” she added. “Hijra” is a co-production between Saudi Arabia’s Film AlUla film commission, the Red Sea Film Festival Foundation, Beit Ameen Production, the Iraqi Independent Film Centre and Ideation Studios.

f77554f90b80,"Ayushmann Khurrana, Rashmika Mandanna, Nawazuddin Siddiqui and Dinesh Vijan Talk ‘Thamma,’ Maddock’s Expanding Horror Comedy Universe (EXCLUSIVE)",,"Ayushmann Khurrana , Rashmika Mandanna , Nawazuddin Siddiqui and producer Dinesh Vijan come together for “ Thamma ,” the latest chapter in Maddock Films’ growing horror comedy universe. Directed by Aditya Sarpotdar and showrun by Amar Kaushik, the film extends the franchise’s mythology while introducing new folklore, humor and emotional depth. When “Stree” opened in 2018, few expected the small-town chiller to spark an enduring cinematic world. Seven years later, Maddock’s horror comedy saga — spanning “Stree,” “Bhediya,” “Stree 2” and “Munjya” — has become one of Hindi cinema’s most distinctive commercial ecosystems. “Thamma” now adds a fresh dimension to that trajectory. “When ‘Stree’ worked, the way we experienced it in theaters made me realize this had potential,” Vijan tells Variety . “Someone once told me, ‘build your own box.’ It stayed with me. When ‘Stree’ fired, I started looking at it like that. The universe formed itself properly by ‘Stree,’ and today we’ve got worlds, planets, rules and surprises that all connect.” He says “Thamma” draws directly from Indian mythology. “The legend of ‘Thamma’ is genuinely Indian source material,” he says. “We often look at Western concepts, but the origin of many of these ideas is ours — way before anything the West has shown.” Khurrana, whose career blends mainstream entertainment with social commentary through titles such as “Andhadhun,” “Article 15” and “Dream Girl,” describes “Thamma” as his first plunge into pure fantasy. “We’ve been jamming on this for the past four or five years,” he says. “It started as a one-liner during the pandemic, and now it’s a full-fledged script. I call it the most sought-after universe in Hindi cinema. I play a Betal [a vampiric spirit from Indian folklore], and the comedy and emotion come from how an ordinary guy deals with supernatural powers. It’s less horror and more comedy, romance and action — the first romantic film of the Maddock horror comedy universe.” Mandanna, whose career has moved fluidly across Telugu, Tamil, Kannada and Hindi-language industries with films including “Kirik Party,” “Pushpa: The Rise,” “Geetha Govindam” and “Animal,” says she was drawn to the blend of tradition and style. “When I heard ‘Thamma’ the first time, I knew I had to be part of this universe,” she says. “These are such rooted characters in our Indian culture, but at the same time they have such swag. There are no references — you’re creating these characters in your mind and completely surrendering to your team. I’m as surprised by the outcome as the audience will be.” Vijan says Mandanna’s role stands out for its physicality. “In ‘Thamma,’ Rashmika’s character is the most physically strong in the whole universe,” he says. “If you’ve seen her work, you know how disciplined she is — every other actor left the gym intimidated.” For Siddiqui, known for intense performances in “Raman Raghav 2.0,” “Sacred Games” and “Gangs of Wasseypur,” “Thamma” marks a tonal departure. “I wasn’t expecting this kind of character,” he says. “As an actor it’s a new challenge — a chance to step out of my comfort zone. I’m very excited to see how I fit into this universe.” Vijan praises Siddiqui’s portrayal of Yakshasan, the film’s antagonist. “I was so pleasantly surprised by Nawaz,” he says. “He’s crazy in the film — he’s having the most fun. Yakshasan is probably the character who’s most clear about what he wants. He believes he’s superior and wants world domination, yet Nawaz somehow makes him human.” The producer adds that “Thamma” carries the franchise’s familiar mix of humor and heart. “I don’t like obvious commentary,” he says. “Whatever’s happening in society happens in films, and vice versa. There’s a subtle messaging on humanity here, but in the most non-obvious way.” As for where “Thamma” fits within the larger Maddock universe, Vijan calls it “the most human” film yet. “This is one you can watch with your entire family — it’s extremely funny,” he says. “Every film has to feel different. ‘Thamma’ adds another dimension without repeating what we’ve done before. The long and short of it is, we can’t be repetitive.” Khurrana agrees. “Since it’s a genesis film, it carries the common thread forward but takes it somewhere new,” he says. “We’ve seen ghosts and spirits before, but nothing like Betals in Hindi cinema. ‘Thamma’ is the Sarvasrisht Betal — the supreme one.” “Thamma” releases Oct. 21 over the Diwali holiday frame.",https://variety.com/2025/film/news/ayushmann-khurrana-rashmika-mandanna-nawazuddin-siddiqui-thamma-1236553295,Entertainment,BBC,Naman Ramachandran,https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Thama-collage.jpg?w=1000&h=563&crop=1,2025-10-15T09:53:42+00:00,35dc27ca117ee05a77478fd479c9d4f87c2251b3
