e0adc8957ee3,Phillipson: Universities must tackle antisemitism,,"Universities must act to protect Jewish students from harassment and discrimination on campuses, Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson has said, as she set out measures to tackle antisemitism. Phillipson said there had been an ""unacceptable increase in antisemitism"" at universities and added that many Jewish students currently do not feel safe on campuses. She said the UK government was funding training to help staff and students at universities ""tackle this poison of antisemitism"". ""There can be no place for harassment and intimidation,"" Phillipson told BBC One's Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg programme. ""Universities can and must act on that."" Speaking on the programme, Conservative shadow foreign secretary Priti Patel said the Labour government should be ""gripping"" antisemitism in the UK, including what she branded ""hate marches where people are being so racist to the Jewish community"". She argued ""hatred"" was demonstrated on the streets of London on Saturday, when thousands of protesters gathered for a rally in support of Palestinians. Ahead of the march, organisers had said they wanted to show solidarity with the Palestinian people. There have also been regular protests staged at universities over the conflict in Gaza, including on the second anniversary of the 7 October Hamas attack on Israel earlier this week. The protests went ahead despite the pleas of Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer, who urged students not to take part, warning of ""rising antisemitism on our streets"". The demonstrations came days after two Jewish men were killed in a terrorist attack at a Manchester synagogue on Yom Kippur. A report by the Community Security Trust , a charity which provides security at sites like synagogues and Jewish schools, last year found a 117% increase in antisemitic incidents on university campuses in the 2022/23 and 2023/2024 academic years, when compared with the preceding two years. Phillipson said she had spoken to Jewish students who felt they needed to conceal their identity. ""On campus, Jewish students don't feel safe,"" she said. ""And often, parents worry about sending their children to university. We cannot accept that. There can be no place for it."" The education secretary said she had written to university vice-chancellors urging them to take steps to protect Jewish students from harassment. The government said the Union of Jewish Students will deliver 600 training sessions to help university staff support students, identify harassment and hate. A £4m fund will support projects that teach pupils and students how to identify misinformation online and promote interfaith understanding. Separately, £2m is being put towards a scheme to teach secondary school pupils in England about the Holocaust - the genocide of Jews during World War Two. Patel said the Conservatives stood by the right to protest and freedom of expression. But Patel told Laura Kuenssberg that pro-Palestinian marches taking place in London were ""ugly protests"" which demonstrated ""division and hatred"" in our society. ""Look at what happened on the streets of London yesterday. Look at the level of hatred that was demonstrated on the streets of London to Britain's Jewish community,"" she said. Thousands of pro-Palestinian protesters gathered in central London on Saturday, as well as a small group of pro-Israeli counter-protesters. The director of the Palestine Solidarity Campaign - one of the groups that organised the march - said it would ""never stop"" supporting Palestinians. Ben Jamal said: ""This is a movement supported by millions of people in this country and around the world who want freedom and justice for Palestine."" During the march, which came a day after a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas began in Gaza, slogans such as ""stop arming Israel"" and ""free Palestine"" could be seen. The Metropolitan Police said it had made 14 arrests for offences including breaching Public Order Act conditions, affray and supporting a proscribed group.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cly9y7gg6eqo,Politics,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/9ad6/live/da179840-a75a-11f0-92db-77261a15b9d2.jpg,2025-10-12T20:20:46.236000+00:00,25ac8e0fac130cd2c1e4fd9a58c026dd9b7c6a8a
541505e0ffe1,Badenoch demands PM address 'unanswered' China spy case questions,,"Badenoch demands PM address 'unanswered' China spy case questions Joshua Nevett Political reporter and Harry Farley Political correspondent AFP/Getty Images Christopher Cash (left) and Christopher Berry (right) both deny the accusation of spying for China Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch has written to the prime minister asking him to address ""unanswered"" questions about the collapsed case against two men accused of spying for China. Charges against Christopher Cash and Christopher Berry - who deny the allegations - were dropped in September, prompting criticism from MPs. The director of public prosecutions (DPP) said the case collapsed because evidence could not be obtained from the government referring to China as a national security threat. On Sunday, Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson said ministers were ""disappointed"" it had not proceeded. In her letter, Badenoch said the government's account of the situation had ""changed repeatedly"". Sir Keir Starmer previously said ministers could only draw on the last government's assessment of China - which dubbed it an ""epoch-defining challenge"" - and his government has maintained it is ""frustrated"" the trial collapsed. Badenoch outlined ""several key questions which remain unanswered"" in her letter on Sunday, and asked that Starmer or a senior minister appear before MPs ""to clear things up once and for all"". She wrote: ""This is a matter of the utmost importance, involving alleged spying on Members of Parliament. It seems that you and your ministers have been too weak to stand up to Beijing on a crucial matter of national security."" The letter queried remarks made by Phillipson to the BBC earlier in the day, in which she said Starmer's national security advisor Jonathan Powell had no role in the ""substance or the evidence"" of the case. Phillipson also said ministers were ""deeply disappointed that the case hasn't proceeded"", and insisted the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) was ""best placed to explain why it was not able to bring forward a prosecution"". The Conservatives had suggested Powell, who has sought closer relations with Beijing, failed to give the CPS the evidence it said it needed to secure convictions. Badenoch questioned Phillipson's comments: ""What does this mean? If he was ""not involved"" in the decision over months not to give the CPS what they needed, then who was?"" Jonathan Powell, one of Sir Keir's most senior advisers and political allies, visited China earlier this year The opposition leader also claimed the government - which had denied ministers were involved in the trial's collapse before the DPP claimed the necessary material had not been obtained - had sought to ""appease China"". She disputed Starmer's comments that ministers could only draw on the previous Conservative government's position, writing: ""As various leading lawyers have pointed out, this is not how the law works."" Starmer had told reporters earlier this week: ""You have to prosecute people on the basis of the circumstances at the time of the alleged offence"". ""So all the focus needs to be on the policy of the Tory government in place then."" Badenoch asked that Starmer clarify whether any ministers knew about the government's interactions with the CPS in which it ""refused"" to provide the material being sought. She also asked if the matter had ever been raised with Starmer, including by Powell, and if an earlier denial of the government's involvement had been ""misleading"". The Conservatives have submitted an urgent question in Parliament, asking ministers to address MPs on Monday to explain why the trial collapsed. Shadow home secretary Chris Philp told the BBC ministers ""must urgently explain why it chose not to disclose the reams of information it has demonstrating China was a threat to national security in the 2021-2023 period"". He said: ""It looks as if Jonathan Powell was behind this decision - and he should resign if he is."" Meanwhile, several former Conservative ministers and advisers have told the BBC there was no official designation of whether a country amounts to a threat. They claim there is a document with ""hundreds"" of examples of Chinese activity posing a threat to the UK at the time of the alleged offences, which could have been given as evidence. Sources cited the hack on the Ministry of Defence, which ministers suspected China was behind, as one of many incidents. ""I don't think there is a sane jury in the world that would look at that evidence and conclude China was not a threat,"" a source in the last government said. Former Conservative ministers also point to public statements, including from the former head of MI5 Ken McCallum, who in 2023 said there had been a ""sustained campaign"" of Chinese espionage on a ""pretty epic scale"". The Liberal Democrats said the government's approach to China was ""putting our national security at risk"". The party urged the government to block the planning application for a new Chinese embassy in London. ""Giving the green light to the super embassy being built in the heart of the City of London and above critical data connections would enable Chinese espionage on an industrial scale,"" Liberal Democrat foreign affairs spokesman Calum Miller said. Mr Cash, a former parliamentary researcher, and Mr Berry, were charged under the Official Secrets Act in April 2024, when the Conservatives were in power. They were accused of gathering and providing information prejudicial to the safety and interests of the state between December 2021 and February 2023. Under the Official Secrets Act, anyone accused of spying can only be prosecuted if the information they passed on was useful to an enemy. Last month, the DPP said ""the case could no longer proceed to trial since the evidence no longer met the evidential test"".

b1f592f9c00a,Starmer arrives in Egypt ahead of summit on Gaza peace plan,,"The prime minister has arrived in Egypt ahead of an international peace summit where the peace plan for Gaza is due to be signed. Sir Keir Starmer will pay ""particular tribute"" to US President Donald Trump at the gathering in Sharm El-Sheikh, Downing Street has said. A ceasefire in Gaza took effect on Friday morning after Israel and Hamas agreed to the first phase of a ceasefire agreement and hostage return deal brokered by Trump, with the next phases still to be negotiated. The US president will lead Monday's summit alongside Egypt's President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, with leaders from more than 20 countries in attendance, a spokesman for Sisi said. Under the deal, Hamas has until 12:00 (09:00 GMT) on Monday to release all Israeli hostages - including 20 who are believed to be alive, and the remains of up to 28 deceased hostages. Israel should also release around 250 Palestinian prisoners and 1,700 detainees from Gaza, while increased amounts of aid should enter the Strip. Many details for the later phases, which would be negotiated after the successful completion of phase one, could be hard to reach agreement on - such as the governance of Gaza, the extent of Israeli troop withdrawal, and the disarming of Hamas. On Sunday, Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson said the UK had ""played a key role behind the scenes in shaping"" the Gaza peace plan. Britain had been involved in ""complex matters of diplomacy"", she told Sky News, without providing further detail. Appearing later on BBC One's Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg, Phillipson was asked to spell out the UK's role, and responded: ""We do have a role, but of course the role of the US has been critical in this - we can all recognise that."" However, Mike Huckabee, the US ambassador to Israel, called Phillipson's comments ""delusional"". Posting on X, he added: ""She can thank [Trump] anytime just to set the record straight."" Israel's deputy foreign minister Sharren Haskel further criticised the UK's claims on Sunday. Also appearing on Sky News, she was asked whether the UK had played a key role, and said the ""opposite"" was true. Haskel said decisions by the UK government - including the one last month to recognise Palestinian statehood - had ""actually pushed Hamas to embolden their position"". Monday's summit in Egypt will involve a ""signing ceremony"" for the peace plan, ""marking a historic turning point for the region after two years of conflict and bloodshed"", Downing Street said. Sir Keir will thank Egypt, Qatar and Turkey for ""bringing us to this point"" as well as Trump, before calling for continued coordination to secure ""swift progress towards phase two"" of the truce. No 10 added in its statement: ""He will offer the UK's steadfast support and engagement with international partners as we look to secure the ceasefire, get urgently needed humanitarian assistance into Gaza and secure a basis for a lasting peace and security."" French President Emmanuel Macron will also attend, the Elysee Palace confirmed on Saturday, where he will ""express his full support for the implementation of the agreement"". Confirming the summit late on Saturday, a spokesperson for Egypt's presidency said it was intended to ""end the war in the Gaza Strip, strengthen peace and stability efforts in the Middle East, and open a new page in regional security and stability"". Trump had told reporters at the White House on Friday that he would be travelling to the region on Monday, addressing Israel's parliament the Knesset, before heading to Egypt. He said: ""We have a lot of leaders from all over the world coming too, they've been invited."" Egypt's foreign ministry had also said US Secretary of State Marco Rubio discussed arrangements for the summit with Foreign Minister Badr Abdelatty. Shadow foreign secretary Dame Priti Patel said the prime minister's visit to Egypt for the Sharm El-Sheikh summit would be a ""photo opportunity"" and the government has ""had no role whatsoever"" in the Gaza ceasefire. ""I think it's extraordinary that Keir Starmer is apparently going to Egypt tomorrow when we've got plenty of domestic issues that he should be resolving,"" she told Kuenssberg. The ceasefire came into effect after the Israeli government approved the first phase of Trump's ceasefire and hostage return deal on Thursday, following three days of indirect talks in Egypt. The Israeli military said it had partially withdrawn troops from parts of Gaza and pulled back to an agreed position within the territory - though troops still occupy half of the Strip. The UK has already said it has ""no plans"" to send British troops to be part of a multinational force that will monitor the latest ceasefire from Israel. The US is moving up to 200 troops already based in the region to what it is calling a civil-military coordination centre in Israel, officials have said, alongside forces from Arab and Muslim countries including Egypt, Qatar, and Turkey. Downing Street said that the UK will also host a three-day summit from Monday to discuss Gaza's recovery and reconstruction. Attendees will include representatives from Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Germany and the Palestinian Authority. Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper said on Friday the UK would continue to support the peace process in other ways, including looking at getting private finance into Gaza. Israel's war on Gaza was triggered by the Hamas-led attacks on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 taken hostage. Since then, more than 67,000 Palestinians have been killed, including more than 18,000 children, the Hamas-run health ministry says. A previous ceasefire agreement that began in January collapsed after two months when Israel resumed its military offensive, having never got past the first stage of a three-stage plan.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c9qnqx7znqno,Politics,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/d6b2/live/01ba3120-a7a4-11f0-80e5-35639bfcaf32.jpg,2025-10-12T22:17:55.836000+00:00,7862aa7f9f007c68d11416e89832ff9115ee9f20
912d73316427,Surge in Chagos arrivals prompts row over housing costs,,"Surge in Chagos arrivals prompts row over housing costs Joshua Nevett Political reporter Damien Dursonial handout Damien Dursonial (C) and his family were among the arrivals at Heathrow this week The UK government is facing calls to support Chagos Islanders who need temporary housing after a surge of them arrived in the country to claim their right to British citizenship. Hillingdon Council said 152 Chagossians had arrived at Heathrow Airport in the borough this week so far, bringing the total to over 600 since last July. The Tory-run council says it expects to spend £2m this year on its legal duty to help homeless British-Chagossians, putting pressure on stretched housing resources and ""breaking"" its finances. Many of the Chagossians are coming from Mauritius because they say they feel unsafe there after the UK government agreed a deal to hand over the Chagos Islands to the country. The UK government said Chagossians were expected to make their own housing arrangements prior to travelling and argued the influx of arrivals was ""completely unrelated"" to the Chagos Islands deal with Mauritius. The Chagos Islands in the Indian Ocean, then an overseas territory of the UK, was transformed into a military base in the 1960s and the entire population was forced to move out, mainly to Mauritius or the Seychelles. But in 2002, a limited number of Chagossians were granted the right to full British citizenship. Several thousand now live in the UK, incuding an expat population of 3,000 in Crawley, West Sussex Then in November 2022, the government launched a new British nationality route which was widened to all individuals of Chagossian descent, living anywhere in the world, permitting them to be recognised as British citizens free of charge. Adults have five years, from 23 November 2022, to claim British nationality. Children born within the five-year application time have until they are 23 to apply. This predated the the UK government's decision this year to sign a deal to hand ownership of the Chagos Islands to Mauritius. Under the deal, the UK has agreed to pay £101m annually for 99 years to keep control of the UK-US military base that was built on Diego Garcia - the largest of the islands. The deal has not gone down well with many Chagossians, who see it as a betrayal and want to see the UK retain sovereignty over the islands so they can one day return to their homeland. Some fear they could be prosecuted by Mauritian authorities for supporting UK sovereignty over the Chagos Archipelago. Damien Dursonial, 35, landed at Heathrow with his wife and two children, aged four and six, on Wednesday this week. Born in Mauritius, where he worked as a police constable, Mr Dursonial saved up for two years and sold his motorcycle to pay for the flights to the UK. ""I came to the UK because it was the only place where we could feel safe, respected and recognised as a British citizen,"" Mr Dursonial said. ""As a Chagossian in Mauritius, we faced real threats by simply identifying as British or supporting UK sovereignty over the Chagos islands."" Mr Dursonial and his family have been placed in temporary accommodation by Hillingdon Council, in West London. But he said: ""The government should have done this because all this work is falling on a local council. ""It had to spend about £1.2m. Whereas ministers are giving away the Chagos Archipelago and taxpayer funds to Mauritius."" Steve Tuckwell says the cost of housing arrivals is ""breaking the council"" Hillingdon Council says it is at risk of going effectively bankrupt and has put in a request for exceptional financial support from the government. It is aiming to cut spending by £38m this year, the largest savings target the council has ever undertaken. ""It's breaking the council,"" Steve Tuckwell, the cabinet member for planning, housing and growth at the Conservative-run council, told the BBC. ""It's taking away hard-earned taxpayers' money from core services."" Tuckwell, a former Tory MP, said the council had written to ministers asking for funding to support Chagossians but had not received any responses. ""I'm calling on the government to do the right thing,"" Tuckwell said. ""Stop this burden on Hillingdon taxpayers. The bank account is running dry."" The Chagos Islands have been under British control since 1814 and became formally established as an overseas territory after the UK government bought the Chagos Archipelago from Mauritius in 1965. The islanders were evicted between 1967 and 1973 to create a joint UK-US military base on Diego Garcia. The global population of Chagossians is estimated to be about 10,000, with many of them living in Mauritius, the Seychelles or the UK. Vanessa Mandarin Calu, who works with Biot Citizen, said many British-Chagossians were temporarily settling in the UK while they wait to return to their homeland. ""Our homeland is a British Overseas Territory - the government should create a clear pathway for British-Chagossians instead of handing our territory to another country without consulting us,"" Ms Mandarin Calu said. Hillingdon Council opened a pop-up processing centre in the borough this week to deal with the surge in Chagossian arrivals. Local authorities have a legal duty to help eligible people who are homeless and provide temporary accommodation for families with dependents. As British citizens, people of Chagossian descent are entitled to the same support as any other homeless person with a UK passport. The council says it is already struggling to support asylum seekers placed in the borough by the Home Office. A government spokesperson said: ""Chagossians travelling to the United Kingdom are expected to arrange their own accommodation prior to arrival. ""Hillingdon Council has received funding to provide support in cases where immediate local pressures arise and cannot be resolved through standard contingency measures, with support for all local authorities kept under ongoing review. ""This is completely unrelated to the Diego Garcia Military Base agreement signed with Mauritius. ""In November 2022, the last government launched a route to British citizenship for the descendants of those born on the Chagos Archipelago. The Diego Garcia agreement has no impact on this.""",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cd721j8390zo,Politics,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/8370/live/76292040-a5d1-11f0-b98a-8b079c99c55e.jpg,2025-10-11T06:39:14.322000+00:00,f247100993cb8f1f9985d32d121f920e383535e3
8685f7036fb9,"Plaid promises independence plan, but not in first term",,"Plaid promises independence plan, but not in first term David Deans Political reporter, BBC Wales News Matthew Horwood Rhun ap Iorwerth has been leader of Plaid since 2023 Plaid Cymru has promised to publish a plan for Welsh independence - but not within the first term of a Plaid-led government. At the party conference members endorsed leader Rhun ap Iorwerth's proposal to set up a ""standing commission"" to talk to the public about the future of the country. Members supported plans for the commission to prepare a white paper on Welsh independence, but ap Iorwerth told members that was not ""for the next government"". He did not give a date for when, but it suggests Plaid Cymru could pursue the idea if it won both the 2026 and 2030 Senedd elections. Ap Iorwerth used the conference in Swansea to present his party as a government in waiting, saying it was ready to replace Welsh Labour at the next vote in May. The party has already pulled back from its previous commitment to offer an independence referendum within five years, made at the last election in 2021 under former leader Adam Price. Ap Iorwerth ruled out a referendum in the first term of a Plaid-led government back in May . However, in Friday's conference speech he said the party would ""kick start the national debate on independence"". Plaid's annual conference on Saturday endorsed a motion that said Wales was ""on a journey to independence, and that enhancing devolution could form part of that journey"". It said a previous Welsh government-backed independent commission on Wales' future was a ""model for engaging people"" on constitutional issues, with the party's motion saying a standing commission should be set up to oversee the government commission's recommendations. Among other things, the government commission called for justice and policing powers to be given to the Welsh government, and for the full devolution of rail services – both decisions the UK government would need to take. Independence was a viable option for Wales' future, the commission had said, although it did not explicitly support it or any other option, with a caveat that independence meant ""hard choices in the short to medium term"". 'Formal path' The conference motion said the standing commission would engage ""citizens in an ongoing dialogue about constitutional issues"" and research ""issues of relevance to Wales' constitutional future"". It would also prepare a ""white paper on Welsh independence"". The motion also said that the power to hold a referendum should be devolved. A white paper is a document that details a government's plans or proposals. The SNP published a white paper on its independence plans ahead of the 2014 Scottish referendum, in its second term of government. BBC Wales was told the standing commission could begin gathering evidence for a white paper in a Plaid first term. Proposing the motion to the conference on Saturday, Ap Iorwerth said: ""The motion looks to the future... and the need ultimately for a white paper which would set the formal path towards asking the people of Wales in a referendum. ""We make it clear it is us that should call the referendum when the time is right. ""But that's not for now or the next government.

05cf2e4341fe,How John Swinney plans to put his stamp on the SNP as election looms,,"How John Swinney plans to put his stamp on the SNP as election looms Glenn Campbell Scotland Political Editor, Aberdeen PA Media John Swinney will make his keynote speech to the conference on Monday There is one sure sign that the Scottish National Party is about to meet for its annual conference. Around this time each year, there is always renewed emphasis on the goal of independence from the party's leadership. And right on cue, the SNP leader and First Minister John Swinney published another Scottish government paper this week promising a ""fresh start"" for Scotland should it become an independent country. It's useful for the SNP leadership to show those gathering in Aberdeen for the party's 91st annual get-together that their primary cause has not been forgotten. In truth, the party is completely stuck on how to establish a viable route to Scottish statehood. That is a source of frustration to many in the SNP and should result in a lively debate on independence strategy at conference later. PA Media Swinney launched a new paper on independence this week Whatever is decided, there is unlikely to be any movement towards independence unless the SNP retains power at Holyrood. That looked to be in serious doubt a year ago when Labour swept to power at Westminster having comprehensively defeated the SNP in a national election for the first time in 14 years. Three things have changed since then. Swinney has stabilised the SNP, Labour's popularity has slumped and the rise of Reform UK appears to have widened the SNP's pathway to what would be an incredible fifth term in office. When John Swinney took over as first minister following the resignations in quick succession of Nicola Sturgeon and Humza Yousaf he inherited a party in turmoil. He has proved to be a steadying force. He quickly calmed controversies over gender identity, the environment and the police investigation into SNP finances which has led to the prosecution of the party's former chief executive Peter Murrell. PA Media Swinney inherited a party in turmoil after the resignations of Humza Yousaf and Nicola Sturgeon If that was phase one of his leadership, phase two was to focus the Scottish government on priorities like improving public services. In short, to try to make a noticeable difference for the public. One ally of the first minister sums up this approach as ""stop digging, get delivering"". Swinney might highlight scrapping peak rail fares , signs of a reduction in child poverty and the decision to lift the two child limit on access to benefits (whether or not the UK government does the same) as examples of progress. The SNP's political opponents would point to persistent long waits on the NHS, cuts to college budgets and the emergency release of prisoners from overcrowded jails as evidence of failure. Among other challenges to be confronted by whoever is in charge, repeated warnings from financial watchdogs that levels of social spending in Scotland are unsustainable. There also appears to have been a decline in trust in the Scottish government to work in Scotland's best interests in recent years, according to the latest social attitudes survey for 2023 . All of this will feature in the pre-election arguments to come. Getty Images Labour's momentum did not last long after Sir Keir Starmer walked into Number 10 Labour insists that Scotland can take a ""new direction"" by ousting the SNP and ushering in a Labour-led government with Anas Sarwar as first minister. Labour's trouble is that their 2024 momentum did not last long after Sir Keir Starmer stepped into Number 10. The unpopularity of the prime minister and the UK government seems to have dragged Scottish Labour down. Opinion polls suggest the SNP has a double digit lead over Labour, with Reform UK nipping at their heels, having pushed the Conservatives into fourth place. The SNP appears far less popular than it was five years ago and the rise of Reform UK seems to be fragmenting support for unionist parties. That could mean the principal party of Scottish independence is still well placed to overcome divided opposition in constituencies across the country and finish as the largest party nationwide. There is nothing definitive about these polls and seven months of campaigning could produce a different outcome. Remember that against widespread expectations, Labour beat the SNP in the Hamilton, Larkhall and Stonehouse by-election earlier this year. PA Media Labour would like to see Scotland take a ""new direction"" by ousting the SNP and ushering in a Labour-led government under Anas Sarwar The Tories hope their calls for cuts in public spending, regulation and taxation will distinguish them from their left-leaning rivals and help them persuade traditional supporters not to switch to Reform UK. While Nigel Farage's party has focused on reducing immigration and more oil and gas exploitation, these are both policy areas outwith Holyrood's control. One hope for the SNP's opponents is that they can rally anti-SNP support behind whichever party appears best placed to beat them in each local area. That has had limited success in the past. As independence is more popular than the SNP at the moment, part of Swinney's strategy will be to entice at least some lapsed SNP voters back. That will mean a bit more talk of independence - a cause for which Swinney has been campaigning since he was 15. With such political experience he will sense that to many within and beyond the SNP, independence seems like something of a political mirage at the moment. The UK Supreme Court has ruled that any future referendum would need the consent of the UK government and Sir Keir Starmer has made clear he has no intention of enabling a vote during his time in power. In a key conference debate on Saturday, Swinney will argue that the ""only uncontested route"" to another referendum is for the SNP to win an overall majority of seats in the Holyrood election next May. That was what persuaded then Prime Minister David Cameron to agree to the 2014 referendum - and the first minister thinks a similar outcome would force the current PM to budge. 'Mandate to deliver independence' Then there are those who think a more radical approach is required. That the SNP should treat the 2026 election as if it were a referendum. In other words, if independence supporting parties secure more than 50% of the votes in the Holyrood list ballot that should be considered as a ""mandate to deliver independence"". It's not clear what that means. Seeking to negotiate with the UK government? Unilaterally declaring independence and daring the UK to block it? Or something else? It is an approach that would not be regarded as legitimate by parties that favour continued union. The Conservatives, Labour, the Liberal Democrats and Reform UK would reject it on the basis that elections are about so much more than the single issue of independence. This is a debate Swinney's team expect to win at conference. Their question is by how much? They will want it to be by the widest possible margin to avoid damaging his authority. One elected politician arguing the alternative case predicted a ""wee gem"" of a debate where the leadership would need to work harder than usual to get their way. Whether the SNP focus on trying to achieve a majority of votes for all independence supporting parties (including the Greens and Alba) or a majority of Holyrood seats for themselves, these are both very high bars to clear. The SNP also needs to be careful about pushing independence too hard. While it remains a popular policy with a large minority of voters it is not necessarily a priority for all those who support it. When asked to identify their key concerns in one recent survey, those asked identified the NHS, the cost of living and immigration as their top three. The Scottish government Swinney met Donald Trump in the Oval Office on his visit to the US So what else can we expect from this conference? It seems to me that Swinney has been working hard to develop an image for himself not just as a first minister but also as a potential statesman. Think meetings with Donald Trump in both Scotland and at the White House, statements at Holyrood on Ukraine and Gaza and a forthcoming visit to Africa. I imagine there will be some reference to Swinney's international engagement, not least because the newly recognised Palestinian ambassador to the UK is due to address conference. It's worth remembering that Swinney took over as first minister midway through a parliamentary term secured on a manifesto signed off by Nicola Sturgeon. Yes, they were close. He was her deputy in government. But this conference, particularly his keynote speech on Monday, is an opportunity for Swinney to put his own stamp on things. Expect him to set out more clearly who he is and what a Swinney government less bound by previous pledges would seek to do. There will obviously be continuity but perhaps some elements of change too. Will that be worthy of description as a third phase of his leadership? Let's see.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cgknlj3vr76o,Politics,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/7eb1/live/3375c820-a68a-11f0-92db-77261a15b9d2.jpg,2025-10-11T08:17:58.053000+00:00,28a976ad43163114d6b79caddbf7d8a657f67f10
d6a0ab907d9d,Tony Blair met Jeffrey Epstein while prime minister,,"Tony Blair met Jeffrey Epstein while prime minister Jennifer McKiernan Political reporter , Joe Pike Politics investigations correspondent and Sam Francis Political reporter Getty Images Sir Tony Blair met with Jeffrey Epstein in Downing Street while still prime minister, following lobbying by Lord Peter Mandelson, the BBC has confirmed. A memo written by senior civil servant Matthew Rycroft, dated 14 May 2002, briefs Sir Tony about ""super-rich"" financial adviser Epstein ahead of a meeting scheduled at 17.00 GMT that day. The meeting was six years before Epstein pleaded guilty to soliciting prostitution from a minor in June 2008. A spokesperson for Sir Tony said: ""As far as he can remember, Mr Blair met with him for less than 30 minutes in Downing Street in 2002, and discussed US and UK politics. He never met or engaged with him subsequently."" He added: ""This was, of course, long before his crimes were known of and his subsequent conviction."" Emails seen by BBC News show Lord Mandelson pushed for the meeting, telling Sir Tony's chief of staff Jonathan Powell that Epstein was ""a friend of mine"" who ex-US President Bill Clinton hoped to introduce to the PM. The release of this and several related documents had previously been blocked by government officials due to concerns about the impact on UK-US relations. The document has now been released by the National Archives under a Freedom of Information request, following the sacking of Lord Mandelson as US ambassador after fresh revelations about his friendship with the disgraced financier. In the email to Powell - the current UK government's national security adviser - Lord Mandelson refers to Epstein as ""safe"". The email on 7 May 2002 states: ""Do you remember when Clinton saw TB [Tony Blair] he said he wanted to introduce his travelling friend, Jeffrey Epstein, to TB? ""This was frustrated - TB said at the time - in the office for reasons (he says) he was unclear about. I think TB would be interested in meeting Jeffrey, who is also a friend of mine, because Jeffrey is an active scientific catalyst/entrepreneur as well as someone who has his finger on the pulse of many worldwide markets and currencies. ""He is young and vibrant. He is safe (whatever that means) and Clinton is now doing a lot of travelling with him."" The email continues: ""I mentioned to TB that Jeffrey is in London next week and he said he would like to meet him. ""I have ascertained from Jeffrey that he is flexible - he could be here any time from Tuesday onwards to fit round the diary - but would obviously need to know reasonably quickly so as to re-schedule accordingly. Can you let me know?"" There are three separate handwritten notes on the print-out of the email, some of which are illegible, but one appears to read ""do you want to do this... Because you wanted to see Clinton by yourself... I know very little more about him"". At the time, Lord Mandelson was a backbench MP, having twice resigned from the cabinet, but still a force in Labour. Clinton has acknowledged being a former associate of Epstein but said had no knowledge of his crimes. Epstein was convicted in Florida for soliciting prostitution from a person under the age of 18 in 2008. He died in 2019 while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges. The National Archive has also released a schedule headed Trade and Industry Meetings with Industry, which includes a memo published on 14 May 2002, briefing Sir Tony about Epstein ahead of a meeting schedule for 17.00 GMT that day. The briefing, written by senior civil servant Matthew Rycroft is marked R, understood to mean restricted. In the memo, Rycroft, who until March 2025 was the permanent secretary at the Home Office, wrote to Blair: ""Jeffrey Epstein is seeing you at 5pm today. ""He is a financial adviser to the super-rich and a property developer. He is a friend of Bill Clinton and Peter Mandelson."" Rycroft states: ""The background on Epstein is that he is very rich and close to the Duke of York"". He adds: ""Peter says that Epstein now travels with Clinton and Clinton wants you to meet him. ""He thinks you would find worthwhile a conversation with him about a) science and b) international economic and monetary trends.""

65453694efa5,"No plans to send UK troops to monitor Gaza ceasefire, says Cooper",,"No plans to send UK troops to monitor Gaza ceasefire, says Cooper Getty Images UK Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper has said there are ""no plans"" to send British troops to be part of a multinational force that will monitor the Gaza ceasefire from Israel. The first phase of a deal with Hamas that will lead to a ceasefire and the release of hostages has been approved by Israel and has now come into effect, according to its military. Cooper, who is meeting foreign ministers in Paris, said the UK will continue to support the peace process in other ways, including looking at getting private finance into Gaza. ""This is still a fragile process but it is one there is a huge momentum behind and a huge commitment to, so we have to make it work,"" she said. The US is moving up to 200 troops already based in the Middle East to Israel to coordinate what it is calling a civil-military coordination centre in Israel, according to US officials. This is intended to oversee the progress of the ceasefire agreement and to help coordinate humanitarian assistance. Forces from Arab and Muslim countries, including Egypt, Qatar, and Turkey, will also be involved, helping to observe the truce and report any violations. US officials said that no American forces would enter Gaza. Asked on BBC Breakfast on Friday whether UK troops would be involved, Cooper said: ""That's not our plan, there's no plans to do that."" The foreign secretary was also asked about Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's recent comments in an interview with Euronews, that Europe had ""essentially become irrelevant"" in ceasefire plans, and said the decision by countries, including the UK, to recognise a Palestinian state had been an ""ultimate reward (to) Islamists"". Cooper replied that the UK has had disagreements with Israel over this issue but that ""the point now is that we need countries coming together to make peace a reality and to actually make it happen"". She insisted that the UK has ""already contributed"" to get to this point in the peace process, including by putting forward proposals as part of a framework for peace and through the recognition of a Palestinian state. Cooper said that moving forward, the UK would be involved in talks with Arab states over ways to get financial investment into Gaza, which has been devastated by two years of Israeli bombardment. On Friday, Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer agreed to back ""substantive humanitarian aid packages"" during the ceasefire, along with the leaders of France and Germany. The leaders, known as the E3, said they ""stand ready to support further talks on the next stages of the plan and to contribute to it"". More than 67,000 Palestinians, mostly civilians, have been killed in Israel's military offensive according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry. Israel launched its military offensive in response to the Hamas attacks on 7 October 2023, when around 1,200 people were killed, mostly Israeli civilians, and 251 were taken hostage. Sir Keir had previously emphasised the UK's role in peace negotiations, and said on Thursday that the country had ""played an important part behind the scenes"". Speaking at a press conference on a visit to Mumbai, he added that the UK now ""stands ready to play our part in implementing this [the peace plan], again with others, as we go forward"". Cooper flew to Paris on Thursday from Northern Ireland with her German counterpart. Both ministers had been attending a meeting of foreign ministers from the Western Balkans at Hillsborough Castle near Belfast. She told the BBC's Today programme on Friday that they had held discussions about the lessons learned during the implementation of peace processes in their own countries in recent decades. ""What we know is that countries can come together to support peace, to resolve conflict, to rebuild nations,"" she said, and added that she believed the reflections could help in Gaza. Meanwhile, Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey said the UK must play a ""maximum role"" in maintaining the ceasefire. ""We're prepared to play our part; the UK must step up,"" Sir Ed said, and added that the UK should push to contribute to a peacekeeping force.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx2pek0lz6mo,Politics,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/7b9a/live/275b3230-a5bf-11f0-b741-177e3e2c2fc7.jpg,2025-10-10T16:02:34.966000+00:00,2128f20eda3c7ad58c2a0bda1bf3230b06c681b9
688657a756e6,Government to consult on digital IDs for 13-year-olds,,"Government to consult on digital IDs for 13-year-olds Jennifer McKiernan Political reporter PA Media The government will consult on whether children aged between 13 and 16-years-old should be included in roll-out of planned digital IDs. The proposed UK-wide scheme will be introduced by 2029, and available to all UK citizens and legal residents but only mandatory in order to work. There has been a backlash to the scheme, with a petition attracting nearly three million signatures. But on Friday, Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper defended the plan, telling LBC ""lots of 13-year-olds already"" have digital IDs and that standardising the process would help. A spokesperson said the government ""need to consult"" on including children as young as 13, since many already work part-time. ""As we announced, it will be a legal requirement for employers to check someone's digital ID as part of Right to Work checks."" the government spokesperson added. ""Children can work part-time from the age of 14. In some local council areas this is from the age of 13."" Under the proposals, digital ID will be available for free to all UK citizens and legal residents. It will be mandatory only for those seeking employment, while remaining optional for students, pensioners and others not entering the workforce. Defending the plans to consider the inclusion of 13 to 16-year-olds in the scheme, Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper told LBC: ""Everybody has forms of digital ID... We all have different ways of having to prove who we are. ""Lots of 13-year-olds already do [have a form of digital ID], and what the department is going to be consulting on is exactly how that should be taken forward. ""I do think that this is the right way forward, to have this standardised process now, and it's something that we had been already setting out for people who come to work from abroad."" The UK petition opposing the IDs warns the scheme could lead to ""mass surveillance and digital control"". However, civil liberties campaign group Big Brother Watch branded the scheme ""Orwellian"" and urged MPs to reject plans. Director Silkie Carlo said: ""The prospects of enrolling even children into this sprawling biometric ID system is sinister, unjustified and prompts the chilling question of just what Starmer's government think the digital ID will be used for in the future. ""At a time when parents are taking a critical view of whether children should have smartphones, it is shocking that the government is considering enrolling children into this digital ID app."" The Liberal Democrats said the consultation on offering digital ID to 13-year-olds showed they had been right to warn about ""mission creep"". ""It is frankly sinister, unnecessary, and a clear step towards state overreach,"" said the party's science and technology spokesperson Victoria Collins. During a trip to India this week , Sir Keir praised the country's far more extensive Aadhaar digital ID system, which includes biometric data, as a ""massive success"". He suggested similar technology could be used in UK banking and public services. Downing Street later clarified his comments, stating the UK scheme would not necessarily replicate India's biometric model and would be run by the public sector. Other countries that already have digital ID systems include Estonia, Denmark and Spain, as well as Canada and Japan. The European Union is introducing the Digital Identity (eID) Wallet, which all member states will be required to roll out to citizens by the end of 2026.

930e5cfd2f96,Farage 'stunned' ex-Wales Reform leader took bribes,,"Farage 'stunned' ex-Wales Reform leader took bribes Adrian Browne Wales political reporter and Dan Moffat BBC Wales Getty Images Reform UK leader Nigel Farage has said he was ""stunned"" when he found out his party's former leader in Wales took bribes to make statements in favour of Russia while a Member of the European Parliament. Last month, Nathan Gill, pleaded guilty to eight counts of bribery between 6 December 2018 and 18 July 2019. Asked, by BBC Wales, if he questioned Gill over the statements, Farage said: ""I didn't know anything about it, all I knew was that he'd been to Ukraine."" ""I told him not to go, he defied me and went, I was completely unaware of any statements that he made."" Gill, who is no longer a Reform member, also used to be a politician in Cardiff Bay. He was one of seven UKIP politicians elected to the Senedd in 2016 when the party was led by Farage. Gill took money from Oleg Voloshyn, once described by the US government as a ""pawn"" of Russian secret services, and made pro-Russian speeches in the European Parliament, statements to a TV channel and arranged an event with a politician close to Moscow. Mr Voloshyn is a former member of the Ukrainian parliament for the pro-Russian Opposition Platform for Life party. Gill's activities emerged in WhatsApp messages on his phone after he was stopped at Manchester Airport on September 13 2021 under counter-terrorism laws. On a campaign visit, on Friday, for the upcoming Caerphilly Senedd by-election, Farage responded publicly for the first time to the Gill bribery case. ""I'd known this person for a very long time, I knew him in the European Parliament in the UKIP days to be a God-fearing Christian, somebody that you would think was the least corruptible person that you would know,"" he said. Asked if he knew about Gill making pro-Russian statements, Farage said: ""I didn't know anything about it."" ""All I knew was that he'd been to Ukraine. He said 'we're going on a visit to Ukraine, do you want to come?' ""I said 'you're off your rocker, this is one of the most corrupt countries in the world,  you must be mad'. And I told him not to go. ""He defied me and went. I was completely unaware of any statements that he made."" Gill served as a UKIP, and later Brexit Party, MEP between 2014 and 2020 and was leader of UKIP Wales between 2014 and 2016. He was leader of Reform UK Wales between March and May 2021, leading the party's Senedd/Welsh Parliament election campaign but is no longer in the party. Gill will be sentenced in November. His defence barrister has said he expects to be jailed. Nigel Farage campaigned alongside Nathan Gill (in red and white striped tie) in Caerphilly in 2019 for the European elections The Caerphilly Senedd by-election, prompted by the sudden death of Labour Senedd member Hefin David in August, takes place on 23 October.

9ba907854b4c,Lib Dems back Bank of England after Farage criticism,,"The Liberal Democrats have promised to back the Bank of England's (BoE) independence ""against Farage's threats"" after the Reform leader urged it to end its bond-selling programme. On Friday, party leader Sir Ed Davey and his deputy Daisy Cooper met the bank's governor Andrew Bailey to ""reaffirm support"" for the Bank's autonomy. It comes two weeks after Nigel Farage met Mr Bailey to argue for the end of BoE bond sales, known as quantitative tightening, claiming it is costing taxpayers billions and driving up debt. Sir Ed accused Farage of ""putting his obsession with mimicking Donald Trump ahead of what is in the best interests of the British people"" by pressuring the central bank. Reform UK has been approached for comment. Sir Ed has pledged to lead the fight against Reform UK - using his Lib Dem conference speech to argue his party had a ""moral responsibility"" to challenge Farage. Speaking after his meeting at the Bank's Threadneedle Street HQ, Sir Ed said: ""Liberal Democrats will stand firmly behind Bank of England independence, just as we have stood against recent attacks on the independence of our judiciary. ""Trump's threats to sack governors of the Fed if they don't do what he wants are causing economic panic in the United States,"" Sir Ed said. ""That is the last thing we need here at home - we cannot let Trump's America become Farage's Britain."" Speaking to reporters later, Sir Ed argued the BoE needed ""modernisation"" but argued keeping it independent from government was ""the best way"" to lower food bills and mortgage rates. The Bank began its quantitative tightening programme in 2022 , unwinding the emergency support it brought in after the 2008 financial crisis. That earlier process, known as quantitative easing, saw the Bank electronically create billions of pounds to buy UK government bonds, a form of debt, in a bid to prop up the UK economy by keeping market interest rates low. The Bank subsequently launched new rounds of QE after the eurozone debt crisis, the Brexit referendum and the coronavirus pandemic. The Bank is now in the process of selling these bonds for less than it paid for them, with losses being picked up by the Treasury under a deal agreed in 2009. Reform has criticised the process, with deputy leader Richard Tice branding it a ""systemic misuse of taxpayers' money"" in a letter to Bailey in June. He also blamed it for increasing the costs of long-term government debt, which recently rose to a 27-year high. Farage and Tice visited the Bank for talks with Bailey on 25 September, after the Bank chief agreed to a meeting. Speaking to reporters afterwards, Tice called for MPs to take a more active role in debating the policy, arguing they were reluctant to do so for fear of encroaching on the bank's independence. But he added that the ""huge multibillion cost"" meant it had an impact on taxation, traditionally a matter for Parliament, and could ""change the decisions the chancellor makes"" at November's Budget. They also pressed the Bank to relax its stance on cryptocurrencies, accusing it of holding back innovation.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cr70g372m91o,Politics,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/2f8b/live/711129e0-a5d6-11f0-b98a-8b079c99c55e.jpg,2025-10-10T12:42:29.008000+00:00,3541b736e9fabbb59610cfe31eab6e6dcb8a8f9e

Arif Ahmed, from the Office for Students (OfS), told the BBC freedom of speech did not mean the freedom to intimidate, harass, and discriminate against Jewish students. He said he was concerned about antisemitism on campuses and warned universities the OfS was ""prepared to act"" if Jewish students were not protected. The regulator has the power to issue fines, cut off access to public funding and revoke the ability to award degrees if universities breach its rules. Mr Ahmed - who champions free speech on campuses in his role - spoke to the BBC's Political Thinking podcast following a wave of pro-Palestinian protests on the second anniversary of the 7 October Hamas attack on Israel. The protests went ahead despite the pleas of Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer, who urged students not to take part , warning of ""rising antisemitism on our streets"". Sir Keir said it was ""un-British to have little respect for others"" by staging demonstrations on the anniversary and argued the protests had been used by some as a ""despicable excuse to attack British Jews"". Students from London universities took part in a joint march on 7 October, while rallies took place in Edinburgh, Belfast and Sheffield. Protest group UCL Action For Palestine, which took part in the London march, posted on social media that it would not be ""silenced or intimidated"" and stood in solidarity with the thousands of Palestinians killed before and prior to October 2023. The protests came days after two Jewish men were killed in a terrorist attack at a Manchester synagogue on Yom Kippur. Security has been stepped up at synagogues across the country in response to the attack. In his interview with Political Thinking, Mr Ahmed said he was concerned about the protests on 7 October and antisemitism against Jewish students. ""Universities and colleges also have a duty to take steps to protect students from harassment and that includes antisemitic harassment,"" he said. ""And we in the OfS will be prepared to act if we think universities are not meeting those duties."" He said if there was ""unlawful support for proscribed organisations"" on campus ""then that's absolutely not something that freedom of speech protects and it is something that we would expect universities to address"". Universities and colleges must be registered with the OfS if they want certain benefits, including access to student loan funding. If universities are deemed to have breached the conditions of registration, they can be sanctioned by the OfS. In March this year, the University of Sussex was fined £585,000 by the OfS for failing to uphold freedom of speech . The OfS said the university's policy statement on trans and non-binary equality, including a requirement to ""positively represent trans people"", could lead to staff and students preventing themselves from voicing opposing views. Risk of political violence In an earlier interview with Political Thinking, Mr Ahmed said the assassination of American conservative activist Charlie Kirk was ""an appalling tragedy"" and warned democracy would not survive if differences could not be settled through speech. ""You must allow people to express their views on really controversial topics, because alternatively, there will be no alternative to violence,"" Mr Ahmed said. ""And that will be the abyss that we end up falling into."" Mr Ahmed also said the OfS was ""ready to act"" to punish universities for not protecting academics and students from harassment and intimidation from foreign dictatorships. Mr Ahmed said he had seen evidence of visiting foreign scholars threatening academics in the UK, whispering in their ears ""we're following you, we're watching you"". He said: ""If your business model involves breaking the law, if your business model involves unlawfully suppressing academic freedom and freedom of speech at the behest of a foreign dictatorship, then you need another business model."" Mr Ahmed said the OfS had powers to force universities to take action. ""We can remove their titles to universities. We can fine them. We can ultimately cut off their access to public funding.""

In an interview with BBC Scotland News, the first minister accepted that ""some people have had to wait far too long"" for certain treatment. But he insisted the Scottish government was working to expand capacity and increase operations and that ""progress is being delivered"". The NHS is still working to recover from the Covid pandemic and, as of June, about one in nine people in Scotland is on an NHS waiting list. Speaking ahead of his party's annual conference in Aberdeen, Swinney also addressed the case of an eight-year-old girl with a serious condition who has been told to expect a 19 month wait for her surgery. The girl's mother has told BBC Scotland News the delay meant her daughter could not live a normal life due to her declining kidney function. The first minister said he could ""totally accept"" the worry and anxiety caused by these circumstances and offered to personally look in to the case. Swinney said the Scottish government was taking all the steps it can within its resources to ensure NHS performance matches the expectations of the public. The most recent Scottish social attitudes study covering the period up to 2023 found that 69% of those asked felt that NHS performance was getting worse. The Royal College of Emergency Medicine also claimed more than 800 deaths in Scotland last year were believed to be linked to long A&E waits. Swinney said: ""What we are doing, what we are focusing on, is about doing all we can to reduce waiting times and make sure more people are being treated and of course the most recent data shows, for example, is we've had record numbers of operations. ""We've had record numbers of hip and knee operations and these are some of the things people have had to wait quite a long time for. ""There is no shortcut. We need to make sure we get a flow of patients in to A&E, so they can get assessed quickly, so they are able to be released home. We have very high levels of patient discharge from hospital, we take all of these steps to make sure people receive care that they require."" 'Counterproductive and damaging' Swinney also said he wanted to avoid industrial action by hospital doctors who are to ballot for a strike. He said the Scottish government would ""work constructively"" with the British Medical Association (BMA) to resolve the dispute. He was also asked about immigration during the interview. Swinney said the UK debate was ""counterproductive and damaging"" and a ""positive approach"" was needed to help grow Scotland's working age population. He said we should ""embrace migration"" and that doing so was ""something we should be proud of"". Swinney said: ""I think we have to have a rational and considered debate about migration because I can't talk to a single business sector or area of activity in our country that doesn't tell me they are short of people. ""We have very low unemployment in Scotland today and our various sectors are short of people and we've got a working age population that is not large enough to support our economy and our activities.

Labour has led Wales since the start of devolution in 1999, and has dominated Welsh politics for a century. The next Senedd election takes place in May. He said the ""transformative"" policy, offering at least 20 hours for 48 weeks a year by 2031, would be a ""helping hand with the things that matter the most"". He told the conference in Swansea that ""Labour's time is up"" and that Reform wanted to treat the Senedd as a ""plaything"" to gain an ""electoral foothold"". Ap Iorwerth called on voters who wanted to stop Reform to back his party, accusing Nigel Farage of spurring a summer of ""simmering hatred"". On Friday he said the 2026 vote will not be an independence election - but said it would ""kick-start"" the debate about whether Wales should go it alone. Currently help with childcare costs is only available to families whose parents are in work, education or training, or to very young children who live in a Flying Start area. Families whose parents are in work, training or education who has less than £100,000 a year in income would still get 30 hours a week for three to four-year-olds, as they do now. Some eligible two-year-olds qualify for 12.5 hours of care a week under Flying Start, but it is not available nationally. Plaid's plan would also allow ineligible families to claim 20 hours a week for three to four-year-olds for 48 weeks of the year, and all families 20 hours for nine-month-olds to two years. The party says the policy would be worth £32,500 to families for the first four years of their child's life. Matthew Horwood/Plaid Cymru Rhun ap Iorwerth was met with a standing ovation as he closed his speech in Braygwyn Hall Ap Iorwerth told BBC Wales: ""This can make a huge difference. It's a very, very important step in terms of helping families with the cost of living. ""This is universal, which marks it out from the system in England."" The Welsh government has been under pressure to match childcare provision in England, where children between nine months and two years of working parents receive free child care. The Bevan Foundation has said that high costs were pushing more families into poverty and out of work . Plaid's plan would be in three stages. It is proposing to keep the existing 30 hour offer for three to four-year-olds, while extending the roll out of 12.5 hours a week for two-year-olds. The next step would be to give 20 hours to parents of three and four-year-olds who are not currently eligible for any help. The party would then try each year to increase the number of hours offered to children under the age of two. It would be rolled out over the life of the next Welsh Parliament, with the policy fully implemented in the 2030/31 financial year. The party says that by the end of the five-year roll out it will spend roughly an extra £500m a year on childcare - bringing the total cost to £800m. It says it can find the cash from the Welsh government's budget, with about £400m thought to be available in the next budget if other services increase by inflation. Ap Iorwerth said it was ""money that we know we can afford"". Getty Images Plaid Cymru says the policy would be worth £32,500 to families for the first four years of their child's life Party sources, asked why parents whose incomes are above £100,000 should get free childcare, said services that are delivered universally are better, and that households across demographics are struggling. Plaid says it would be the most generous childcare care offer in the UK. 'Plaything' Ap Iorwerth, a former BBC Wales broadcaster, announced the policy in a speech where he set his party stall as a government-in-waiting. He called on his party to seize the ""historic opportunity ahead"" and turn it into ""reality"". Plaid Cymru has played a key role during the life of devolution, being an occasional supporter of Labour governments since 1999. It has been unable to beat Labour in an election - but recent opinion polling has suggested Plaid is vying with the party to win, as is Reform. The Member of the Senedd for Ynys Môn told the conference hall that Labour had forgotten ""where it came from who it was there to serve"". He said the UK had faced a summer of ""simmering hatred"", spurred on, he said, by Nigel Farage. ""Farage and his followers drive the deliberate fragmentation of society, giving life to the bogeyman without whom they are nothing."" He said Reform UK wanted to treat the Senedd as a ""plaything"" to gain ""an electoral foothold"". 'New leadership' Ap Iorwerth said Plaid was ready to govern ""right now"", promising to ""usher in an age of new leadership that will set Wales on a different path."" ""We are not here as Labour's conscious, we are not here to repair Labour, we are here to replace them,"" he said. The party leader promised an ""immediate cash injection"" into the NHS to prioritise the longest waits. He warned that Reform threatened the health service with ""US-style bills"", and vowed to keep the NHS free at point of need. Matthew Horwood/Plaid Cymru Ap Iorwerth was elected the new leader of Plaid Cymru in 2023 Ap Iorwerth was greeted with cheers and applause throughout the speech, and was given a standing ovation after he called on those who have ""never voted for Plaid Cymru before, the time is now"". ""The time is now to stop Reform and elect a government more radical, more ambitious, more impatient to bring about positive change."" He said his government would be on the side of ""young and old, urban and rural, north and south, Welsh speaker, non Welsh-speaker"". The party has traditionally been stronger in its Welsh-speaking heartlands of north and west Wales. Plaid Cymru promised a referendum on independence at the last election in 2021 - but is not now. Earlier Ap Iorwerth told Radio Wales Breakfast the 2026 election would not be about independence for Plaid. ""There's no referendum... in the next few years,"" he said. But in his speech he said the party ""will kick start the national debate on independence"", building on the work of the previous commission on Wales' constitutional future by setting up a permanent commission. ""It's not just about aspiration, it's about creating the best chance to build a modern nation of good health, opportunity, prosperity, and fairness,"" he said. Analysis Rhun ap Iorwerth is hoping to be Wales' first non-Labour first minister - judging by the reaction in the hall, his members think he can. Plaid Cymru conferences can be business like affairs but there was a definite change in the atmosphere in Swansea - not a city in the party's usual heartland of north and west Wales - with a speech that was well received in Brangwyn Hall. It is not proposing wholescale shake up of public services - the party leader thinks that's too risky in the current climate - but says it offers ""radical"" plans such as a payment to tackle child poverty . Labour's woes have given the party the best chance it has ever had to lead Wales but Plaid faces some challenges. If Plaid came first it is possible they would have to work with Labour or other parties in some form, with no party having ever won a majority in the Senedd. It is also hoping to bring people who have never voted for Plaid into the fold, in the hope they are motivated by wanting to stop Reform. The party has to convince voters they are the best option to do that, while the Greens, the Lib Dems and Labour say similar things. They also face a Reform party that has Wales set in its sights - a party with greater resources, something Plaid has struggled with in the past.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cewnv2xprzko,Politics,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/6900/live/0eb52e40-a5f9-11f0-928c-71dbb8619e94.jpg,2025-10-10T16:38:28.234000+00:00,45ecccb5cad00a89125121d6430285bb6ecd7efa

Fayaz Khan, 26, posted a video last October where he named the Reform UK leader and made a gun gesture with his hand. The jury went out at 12:54 BST on Wednesday before returning its verdict at Southwark Crown Court on Friday. Khan had a ""very large presence online"" with his videos on TikTok under the username ""madapasa"", amassing hundreds of thousands of views. PA Media Reform UK leader Nigel Farage went to Southwark Crown Court to give evidence during Khan's trial Prosecutor Peter Ratliff said Khan's videos showed his attempts to come to the UK by small boat from Afghanistan. On 12 October, Farage uploaded a video to YouTube titled ""the journey of an illegal migrant"" which highlighted Khan and referenced ""young males of fighting age coming into our country about whom we know very little"". Mr Ratliff said Khan responded with a video on 14 October, which was played to the jury, in which Khan addressed the Reform UK MP as ""Englishman Nigel"". The video continued: ""You not know me. I come to England because I want to marry with your sister. You not know me. ""Don't talk about me more. Delete the video. ""I'm coming to England. I'm going to pop, pop, pop."" Mr Ratliff told the jury that while Khan said ""pop, pop, pop"" he had made ""gun gestures"" with his hand and headbutted the camera. 'Pretty chilling' Khan, an Afghan migrant, had also pointed towards an AK-47 tattoo on his face to ""emphasise he wasn't joking"". The prosecutor added: ""If you've got an AK-47 tattooed on your arm and your face, it's because you love AK-47s and you want the world to know that."" Farage, the MP for Clacton in Essex, gave evidence on Tuesday and said Khan's video was ""pretty chilling"", adding: ""Given his proximity to guns and love of guns, I was genuinely worried."" The Reform UK leader added: ""He says he's coming to England and he's going to shoot me."" Jurors were shown other videos posted on social media by Khan in which he appeared to make ""pop, pop, pop"" noises and similar hand gestures to those in the TikTok video referencing Farage. Metropolitan Police Khan came to the UK on a small boat last year from Afghanistan Khan was not called to give evidence on Wednesday by defence lawyer Charles Royle, but in a police interview last year he had said: ""It was never my intention to kill him or anything. ""This is my character, this is how I act in my videos."" Khan said: ""In every video I make those sounds, I say 'pop, pop pop'."" Jurors were also shown a screenshot of a subsequent TikTok post by Khan with the caption ""I mean what I say"" written on an image of a GB News report about the alleged threat against Farage. In the prosecution's closing speech, Mr Ratliff said the alleged threat to kill was ""not some off-the-cuff comment"" and the video was ""sinister and menacing"". He added that Khan was ""a dangerous man with an interest in firearms"". In his closing defence speech, Mr Royle said Khan was ""remonstrating in his own idiosyncratic, moronic, comedic, eye-catching, attention-seeking way"", rather than making a threat to kill. The Metropolitan Police said Khan is due to be sentenced on 14 October.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cdx216n1529o,Politics,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/343f/live/f5763790-a5e3-11f0-92db-77261a15b9d2.jpg,2025-10-10T15:03:10.289000+00:00,9d9ce8869979ec4602a2b57be3169ceb54670806

3b93fe02d029,Sunak takes advisory roles with Microsoft and AI firm Anthropic,,"Rishi Sunak has taken up advisory roles at tech giant Microsoft and artificial intelligence start-up Anthropic. The former prime minister - who remains the MP for Richmond and Northallerton - said he was ""delighted"" to be working ""with two of the world's leading tech firms"" and planned to donate his earnings to a charity he founded. Sunak has been told he must not lobby ministers on behalf of the companies by the Advisory Committee on Business Appointments (Acoba), an independent watchdog which oversees the activities of former government figures. During his premiership he made tech regulation a significant priority, setting up an AI safety summit in 2023 . In letters of advice sent to Sunak by Acoba and published on Thursday, his part-time role at Microsoft was described as providing ""high- level strategic perspectives"" on geopolitical trends. The watchdog said it had been informed by Sunak that his part-time advisory role at Anthropic - an AI firm seeking to compete with companies like OpenAI, Google and Meta - would be ""akin to operating as an internal think tank"". Acoba said Anthropic ""has a significant interest in UK government policy"", meaning that Sunak's appointment could potentially be seen to offer ""unfair access and influence"" within government. The appointment with Microsoft, a ""major investor"" in the UK, also presented similar issues, it wrote. However, it also said that his time spent out of government would have reduced the value of any information Sunak may still possess, while reiterating the standing rules ex-ministers have to abide when seeking employment after leaving government. Sunak was told not to advise on bidding for UK contracts, or to lobby the government for two years from his last day in ministerial office. In addition to the two tech roles, it was previously confirmed Sunak will act as a paid advisor to the bank Goldman Sachs , where he previously worked between 2001 and 2004. There had been speculation that Sunak, who was in No 10 between October 2022 and July 2024, would leave the Commons to take up a Silicon Valley role shortly after the election. He previously lived in California, where he still has a home, and held a US visa until 2021. But in his final prime minister's questions, Sunak vowed to spend more time in his constituency, which he called ""the greatest place on Earth"". ""If anyone needs me, I will be in Yorkshire,"" he said. All proceeds from the new roles will be donated to The Richmond Project, a charity Sunak founded with his wife to tackle numeracy problems in the UK, another area he was vocal about while in Downing Street. Posting on social media, Sunak said he would use his roles to ""ensure"" that coming technological change ""delivers the improvements in all of our lives"". Sunak said: ""I have long believed that technology will transform our world and play a key part in determining our future.

Nine people were removed on Thursday, in addition to a group of 10 last week, the government said. Previous removals have involved smaller numbers of people. It takes the number returned to France under the deal to 26, while the UK has accepted 18 in return. Ministers hope the scheme will deter people from attempting to enter the UK illegally in small boats by threatening removal to France, with properly vetted asylum seekers accepted in return. But on Thursday, the Home Office confirmed 1,075 migrants crossed the Channel the previous day. Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood said the recent return of larger groups would send a ""clear message"" to ""think twice"" about travelling to the UK illegally. ""We must put an end to these dangerous crossings which put lives at risk and money in the pockets of criminal gangs,"" Mahmood said. Thursday's flight saw a regular deportation flight bound for Eastern Europe diverted to France to offload nine people. The Home Office said more flights are scheduled to take place ""over the coming days and weeks"". The first removal under the UK-France deal was carried out in September, with the scheme set to run until June 2026.

East Wiltshire MP Danny Kruger became the first sitting Conservative MP to defect to the party last month and has now written to his 71,000-strong electorate to explain why. He explained he had ""jumped ship"" because of what he claimed were Tory ""failures"" on issues such as mass migration and Brexit, which he believes led to a loss of confidence in the party. The Conservative Party has been contacted for comment on Mr Kruger's claims. Mr Kruger said his former party was ""rightly and naturally punished for its record"" at the 2024 election in the letter, which was sent to every constituency household. He said: ""I was elected in 2019 to 'get Brexit done' and then – as Boris always stressed – to move beyond Brexit and fix the underlying problems with our country. ""We did the Brexit bit, but then we failed. Most of all, we failed to control our borders and reduce taxes as we had promised. ""Many of our communities have experienced huge and unwelcome change due to mass migration."" He further described his unhappiness at the armed forces being ""hollowed out"", the ""highly precarious"" nature of the economy, and said public services were ""at the brink of collapse"", despite spending increases. Following his defection, Mr Kruger was criticised for not calling a by-election by both the leader of the Conservatives on Wiltshire Council, Richard Clewer, and Melksham and Devizes Conservative Association chair Brian Burchfield.

532441c5e000,Pubs could stay open longer under licensing reforms,,"Pubs could stay open longer under licensing reforms Getty Images Pubs and bars in England and Wales could see extended opening hours as the government launches a fast-track review on ""outdated"" licensing rules. The plans could make it easier for venues to serve food outside and host more live music, in a bid to ""remove unnecessary barriers"". Pub landlords and local communities will be able to have their say in a four-week call for evidence. Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said the review was about ""cutting red tape"" and ""boosting footfall"" to support the UK's economic growth. But critics have warned relaxing rules around alcohol would lead to more antisocial behaviour. Sir Keir said ""pubs and bars are the beating heart of our communities"", and added that the government was ""backing them to thrive"". ""When our locals do well, our economy does too,"" he said. The call for evidence will focus on nine key recommendations from the government's licensing taskforce, with particular emphasis on streamlining on-trade alcohol licensing for hospitality venues. It said it plans to cut the cost of licensing , extend business rates relief and cut alcohol duty on draught pints. A proposal to remove the local newspaper advertising requirement for a manager wanting to set up a premises or alter their licence was among the taskforce's other recommendations. It also recommended a permanent increase to the number of temporary event notices - needed to hold a one-off licensable event on unlicensed premises - and simpler rules for trading in outdoor areas. Nick Mackenzie, co-chair of the licensing taskforce and chief executive at pub giant Greene King, said updating the licensing system was a ""vital step"" towards reducing the challenges of running a hospitality business. ""Pubs are faced with continued rising costs, placing them under enormous pressures which is why the government must continue to back the sector, including critical reforms on business rates which would unlock opportunities for pubs to invest and help drive economic growth,"" he said. UK Hospitality, the body which represents pubs and bars in the UK, welcomed the review and said the changes could reduce red tape and costs stifling businesses. ""Under the current regime, a single complaint from a single resident is enough often to stop a business from being able to trade. It can result in a review; it can result in a business being closed down,"" Kate Nicholls, chief executive of the body, told BBC Radio 4 Today programme. ""This is not about trading later, this is not about 24-hour licensing and drinking, this is about making sure that we can respond to consumer demands, and that we can offer freedom and flexibility at a low enough costs."" Andrew Griffith, the shadow business secretary, called for the government to implement the licensing taskforce's recommendations published in June and cease ""endlessly delaying whilst it's literally 'last orders' for many pubs and businesses'. But Richard Piper, the chief executive of the charity Alcohol Change UK told the Guardian the proposed reforms would be a ""charter for chaos"" without support from local authorities and health experts. He said permitting vendors to sell alcohol later into the evening would ""inevitably mean more victims of crime, including domestic violence, more antisocial behaviour and disturbance, more police time spent dealing with drink-fuelled incidents and both ambulance and A&E staff having to deal with even more people who have come to harm as a result of alcohol"". Pubs in England and Wales do not have universal fixed opening hours under current licensing rules. Instead, local authorities grant licenses with specific operating hours which pubs must follow. The number of pubs in the UK has steadily decreased every year since 2000, according to the British Beer and Pub Association. The association estimates that 378 pubs would close in 2025 across England, Wales and Scotland, amounting to more than 5,600 direct job losses. The BBC has heard from landlords and customers on government's licensing review. Mark Costello from Leeds, who runs a brewery and tap room, said costs were his main concern. ""It doesn't matter how long we're allowed to stay open; it costs a huge amount to stay open so what we need is the customers to fill the place, and they don't have the money to go out like they used to,"" he said. ""We need help with business rates, energy and staffing costs,"" he added Jay Ashton from Huddersfield, who owns two micropubs said he has to deal with ""a bureaucratic mountain"" when dealing with the councils who he says are ""barriers to growth"". Andy in Heathfield, East Sussex, said a pub he lives next to is making ""everyone's lives a misery"" and longer hours and more music will destroy the village. David from Cambridge, who has been a pub goer for 55 years, says the increased business rates, national insurance and minimum wage and customers with less disposable income are the real problem facing pubs.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c1l830m55dno,Politics,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/397e/live/2a95de20-a4eb-11f0-928c-71dbb8619e94.jpg,2025-10-09T10:35:20.596000+00:00,3c60ceb4db9c779c1f41d49d65c5b4ee65cc85fb

The two leaders met to discuss ways to expand business and trade links after they signed a landmark trade deal in July . Sir Keir's two-day visit to India's financial capital involved the UK's  largest-ever trade delegation of more than 100 CEOs, entrepreneurs, university vice-chancellors and cultural leaders. Among the other issues discussed by the two prime ministers was the war in Ukraine, as India continues to buy Russian fossil fuels, helping to fund Vladimir Putin's war effort. Sir Keir described the trade deal as ""huge"" for the UK and ""the most ambitious trade deal India has ever done"". Speaking at a press conference, he said: ""This trade deal is a launchpad to boost British leadership in everything from tech, to life sciences, to renewable energy and much more beyond that... ""The opportunity is clear - Just look at the sheer scale of India, the world's largest democracy on track to become the third-largest economy by 2028."" In their meeting, the PM said the pair discussed the need for ""a just and lasting peace in Ukraine, the need for stability and security in the Indo-Pacific, and the need to co-operate in critical areas like climate and energy, including breaking away from dependence on fossil fuels"". Asked whether he raised the issue of India buying Russian oil, Sir Keir told journalists: ""Yes, we did discuss that this morning with President Modi, and we each went through the steps we're taking to bring about a resolution of the conflict."" Modi has described himself as a friend of Putin, but suggested he wanted to see the Ukraine war come to an end through ""dialogue and diplomacy"". Sir Keir said he also raised the case of Jagtar Singh Johal , a British Sikh activist who has been held in an Indian prison for seven years without a conviction. WPA Pool/Getty Images Thousands of photos of Sir Keir Starmer and Narendra Modi line streets in Mumbai Arriving in India, the prime minister was given a rousing welcome, with thousands of giant photos of him and Modi lining the streets in Mumbai. On Thursday Sir Keir announced more UK universities would be opening campuses in India, which the government said would bring a £50m boost to the economy. Confirming that the University of Lancaster and the University of Surrey had been given approval for new campuses, he said: ""I'm delighted that more Indian students will be able to benefit from a world-class British education in the near future – strengthening the ties between our two countries while pumping millions back into our economy and supporting jobs at home."" The UK has a growing network of international campuses in India, with the University of York, University of Aberdeen and Queen's University Belfast among those expected to open campuses from as early as next year. On his first day, Sir Keir met the founder of India's digital ID system - Nandan Nilekani - in the wake of plans to introduce a digital ID for people working in the UK. The government's plan to introduce compulsory digital ID for people to prove their right to work in the UK has seen more than 2.8 million people signing a petition against the idea. But Downing Street is determined to press on, claiming it will curb the ability of migrants to work illegally. The government says the yet-to-be-implemented UK-India trade deal has already led to £1bn of investment and almost 7,000 jobs being created in the UK. Under the deal the UK will cut taxes on goods imported from India including clothing, footwear, jewellery and frozen seafood, while India will reduce duties on the import of Scotch whisky, cosmetics, medical devices and luxury cars.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/czdj66llg9go,Politics,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/46b6/live/0cd29c00-a4cf-11f0-b9e2-5ff3a1edd7bf.jpg,2025-10-09T14:44:04.198000+00:00,ff8972547f5f79b43722ed535698da96ccf9e748

That is despite the Lib Dems having their most successful general election ever last year in terms of seats won. A party spokesperson said ""in actual elections, more and more people are backing the Liberal Democrats"". It comes as the Green Party of England and Wales says it now has 90,000 members, a 91% increase on 2020 figures. The Liberal Democrats saw a significant boost in membership in the run-up to Brexit in 2020, when the party was campaigning for a second referendum. The drop in paid-up members since then has been masked by the inclusion of ""registered supporters"" in figures published in the party's annual accounts each year since 2017. Registered supporters sign up for free to get access to briefings and events, but they cannot decide policy or vote in leadership elections. The party clearly states the figure published in the annual accounts relates to both member and supporters. However, it does not provide a breakdown. 'Public profile' Prof Tim Bale leads the Party Membership Project, a joint project between Queen Mary University of London and Sussex University. He said the drop in membership was surprising given the Lib Dems' electoral success, which would suggest ""a party on the up, in which case you might get more ambitious people wanting to join it"". But he added: ""There's an extent to which surges into parties are prompted by public profile... and they don't seem to have much chance of getting into government at the moment."" In more positive news for the Lib Dems, he said research carried out by his project after the 2024 election showed that the Liberal Democrats were the most active of all the memberships of the political parties. Figures collected showed that a greater proportion of Lib Dem members (19%) had canvassed voters face-to-face or over the phone than any other party. Prof Bale said there was ""all sorts of research over time that, certainly in very close races, contact with the voters, whether that be face to face or just leafletting does seem to make a difference"". A Liberal Democrat spokesperson said: ""We have a record number of MPs, the most popular party leader in the country, and elected more councillors than Labour or the Conservatives for the first time ever in May's local elections. ""When it comes to actual elections, more and more people are backing the Liberal Democrats as the only party that can stop Reform turning Trump's America into Farage's Britain."" Other parties Working out how many members a political party has can be tricky. There is no legal obligation for political parties to publish their membership figures, so they tend to only be revealed in annual accounts or when a party holds a leadership election. Labour, which is the largest political party in the UK on current publicly available figures, has seen a drop in membership of 37% since 2020. Latest published figures put its membership at 333,235 at the end of last year, although reports have suggested it may have fallen further to 309,000. An updated figure should be given by Labour later this month, when the winner of its deputy leadership contest is announced. Reform UK did not give a figure for membership in its annual accounts last year, but a ticker on its website says it has just under 260,000 members. The Green Party of England and Wales has seen a rapid surge in membership and now says its has 90,000 members, which is a 54% rise on last year's figure of 58,322 in December. The Conservatives do not routinely publish their membership figures, but 131,680 people were eligible to vote in last year's Tory leadership election, which is 40,000 fewer than in the 2022 contest. Party membership figures are not verified by outside bodies. Where we got our figures The figure that has been most recently used for the current size of the Lib Dems is 83,174, which was the figure for December 2024 that appears in the party's annual accounts, including both members and registered supporters. As the freelance journalist Adam Ramsay has pointed out, the figure for paid-up members is given elsewhere, in a statement for the party treasurer in the accounts for the Liberal Democrats in England . It says there was an ""overall membership of 60K"", with 55,000 - or 92% of them - in England, and supporter levels that ""remain constant at over 20K"". To get the membership figure for 2020, we looked to the number of ballot papers issued in the leadership election, as only full members can vote. At the time, the party said it had issued 117,924, papers, which was its highest ever number.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy5069p70x2o,Politics,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/2fa8/live/4ac8fe20-a45f-11f0-a789-358ea6d9d143.png,2025-10-09T01:13:34.391000+00:00,686e1a8729e5033c76cfd3d7c632471b9b52762f
9d94af385a6e,All Post Office Horizon victims entitled to free legal advice for first time,,"All Post Office Horizon victims entitled to free legal advice for first time Emma Simpson Business correspondent and Emer Moreau Business reporter PA Media All victims of the Post Office Horizon IT scandal who are claiming compensation will now be entitled to free legal advice to help them with their offers, the government has announced. The change could potentially have a major effect on the size of the payouts some victims are able to achieve. It is one of a number of improvements to the compensation schemes available to victims, made in response to the first report from the public inquiry into the scandal, widely described as one of the UK's worst ever miscarriages of justice. In July, the chair of the inquiry, Sir Wyn Williams, delivered his findings into the human impact of the scandal and called for urgent action . The government said it has accepted all but one of the recommendations relating specifically to Horizon. More than 900 sub-postmasters were prosecuted after the faulty Horizon computer system made it look like money was missing from their branch accounts. Hundreds of others poured their own savings into their branch to make up apparent shortfalls in order to avoid prosecution. Making the announcement, Business Secretary Peter Kyle said there was ""clearly more to do to bring justice to those affected"" and accepting the recommendations was a ""crucial step"" towards doing this. There are now three compensation schemes for victims in various circumstances, but they have been criticised for being too slow and complicated with many of the worst affected victims receiving offers for far less than they'd originally claimed for. Victims who have sought compensation through the Horizon Shortfall Scheme (HSS) - which accounts for more than half of the compensation claims paid out so far - are now eligible for government-funded legal advice to help them decide whether to accept a fixed sum offer, in changes announced by the government on Thursday. This brings it in line with the other schemes. The government has also committed to setting up a new appeals process for postmasters who accepted a fixed payout under the HSS scheme, which also includes funded legal advice. Many victims have previously complained about being forced to accept low offers of compensation, without the benefit of legal help. Action taken in response to other recommendations included: the government extending the date for the closure of the HSS scheme giving greater clarity on the definition of ""full and fair redress"" starting work on a restorative justice project for postmasters So far, more than £1.2bn has been paid out to more than 9,000 claimants across all of the compensation schemes. The Post Office said it had been working closely with the Government to respond to the inquiry's report and had agreed a deadline of the end of January 2026 for accepting new applications to the Horizon Shortfall Scheme, saying it would give potential applicants more time to consider their case. ""I encourage any current or former postmaster who thinks they might be eligible for the Horizon Shortfall Scheme to get in touch ahead of the closure date. We have a dedicated claimant support team available on the phone to discuss your options, provide support, and answer any questions so we can begin to process your claim right away,""  said Post Office Chair, Nigel Railton. Reacting, a spokesperson for Fujitsu - who provided the Horizon IT system - said the company had ""apologised for, and deeply regret, our role in sub-postmasters' suffering"". 'Battling all the time' Tony Downey Tony Downey and his wife Caroline were victims of the Post Office scandal Tony Downey bought the Hawkshead Post Office in the Lake District in 2001. He and his wife Caroline were forced to put in £35,000 of their own savings to make up for ""losses"" created by the faulty software. He lost his home, his livelihood and went bankrupt as a result. His health has also suffered. Mr Downey is still waiting for full compensation nearly three years after submitting his claim. ""It just seems to be battling, all the time, to get a little bit more, and a little bit more, and a little bit more,"" he said. ""We're just exhausted with it."" Responding to Mr Downey's testimony, a government spokesperson said: ""While we do not comment on individual cases, we take every effort to make full and fair offers to all claimants and only request information that will enable us to do so."" Neil Hudgell of Hudgell Solicitors, which represents hundreds of victims, said it is ""proper that applicants are entitled to have their cases fully assessed before electing to accept a fixed sum"". He said there would likely be ""an upturn in numbers"" seeking compensation as deadlines for applying are set. ""There are clearly going to be a lot more claims in the system,"" he said. Mr Hudgell added that claims were still being processed slowly, and said that unless more resources were invested to speed up claims handling, ""we will still be needing to talk about compensation claims in three to five years' time.""",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cg7dx7le0ddo,Politics,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/a196/live/d4a0ecd0-a4fe-11f0-9779-cd87a9626924.jpg,2025-10-09T16:00:32.490000+00:00,c67b42e1d1fd72ed1ba318c5909ddfb28d42c776

Caroline Clapper, who sits on both Hertfordshire County and Hertsmere Borough councils, said a by-election would incur ""a significant and unnecessary cost to the taxpayer"". Fellow defector Brett Rosehill said other councillors had switched parties and this was the first time demands had been made for a by-election. Clapper also said there was no precedent for a poll being called following a politician's move to a different party. Steve Fraser Steve Fraser, a Hertsmere voter, says councillors who change party should resign and contest a by-election Steve Fraser, who lives in Potters Bar, said: ""When our councillors decide to change parties part way through their term of office, they should resign so that an election is held. ""Most people intend their vote for a party in the election, rather than for the particular person standing. ""So, if someone decides to change party part way through their term it's only fair that they should resign and, if they like, stand again in their new colours."" On social media, Carol Ripley said: ""Sorry but this is just not fair on voters who elected this councillor."" In the county council elections earlier this year, Clapper received 67% of the vote for the Conservatives in Watling ward. The Reform UK candidate in the same ward came second with just 16%, but that result may not necessarily be replicated in a by-election. Simon Dedman/BBC Caroline Clapper was re-elected to the Watling ward in this year's election Clapper said: ""I completely understand that some residents may feel surprised or disappointed by my decision to join Reform UK after so many years as a Conservative. ""It is not a decision I have taken lightly. ""However, in local elections people vote first and foremost for the individual candidate they trust to work hard for them. ""There is no precedent for councillors standing down and calling a by-election after changing party affiliation, and such a move would incur a significant and unnecessary cost to the taxpayer."" Rosehill added: ""During this administration alone, there have been five councillors who have switched parties, and this is the first time such demands have been made.

526905a3ce11,"Conservatives would scrap stamp duty, Badenoch announces",,"Conservatives would scrap stamp duty, Badenoch announces Brian Wheeler Political reporter Standing ovation as Badenoch says Tories would scrap stamp duty The next Conservative government would abolish stamp duty on the purchase of main homes, Kemi Badenoch has said, in a surprise announcement at the end of her first conference speech as party leader. Badenoch received a standing ovation from Tory activists in Manchester as she declared: ""That is how we will help achieve the dream of home ownership for millions."" She said scrapping stamp duty - a tax paid by home buyers in England and Northern Ireland - will ""unlock a fairer and more aspirational society"" and help people of all ages. It came after a speech packed with new policies aimed at grabbing political attention and setting out clear dividing lines with her opponents. Badenoch was under pressure to deliver the speech of her political career, to end speculation that she will face a leadership challenge, as her party continues to trail Labour and Reform UK in the polls. Her 45-minute address was peppered with jokes and personal stories and went down well in the hall, where - in contrast to some of the other speeches this week - there was standing room only. And in a clear break with the leaders' speeches at the Labour and Liberal Democrat conferences, she only mentioned Reform twice. Instead, she concentrated her fire on Labour, accusing Sir Keir Starmer of leading a  ""weak and directionless"" government, which was making ""one hell of a mess"" of the country. Her announcement on stamp duty was kept under wraps until she delivered it, telling the Tory faithful: ""Stamp duty is a bad tax. ""We must free up our housing market, because a society where no-one can afford to buy or move is a society where social mobility is dead."" 'Golden rule' Stamp duty is paid by people buying homes in England and Northern Ireland for more than £125,000 - but first time buyers are exempt from it on properties worth up to £300,000. Those buying homes worth more pay a percentage of the value of the home. Chancellor Rachel Reeves was reported to be considering scrapping stamp duty at her Budget in November, although Badenoch claimed it would be significantly increased. Under the Tory plans, stamp duty would be abolished entirely on ""primary residences"". The tax would continue to be charged on additional properties, properties purchased by companies, or by non-UK residents. The Scottish and Welsh arms of the party have confirmed that they would replicate the cut if elected in Scotland and Wales, where taxes similar to stamp duty apply to property purchases. The Conservatives said they had ""cautiously"" estimated that abolishing stamp duty on main homes after 2029 would cost the Treasury £9bn a year. The Institute for Fiscal Studies said the direct cost of the cut might be around £10.5-11bn a year by that point, with additional costs in Scotland and Wales taken into account. But researchers at the think tank added the estimated cost given by the Tories was not ""unreasonably low"", given uncertainty over how house purchases and property prices could evolve in the coming years. Badenoch insisted she could meet this promise with the money to come from £47bn in planned savings the party announced earlier this week, from cuts to the welfare budget, foreign aid, and Civil Service. The Conservative leader has promised that in office, her party would ensure half of all savings would be put towards reducing the deficit, the gap between government spending and tax revenues. Badenoch said the pledge would be a ""golden rule"" of any future Tory government, as she tries to rebuild credibility on the economy and present her party as the only one that will responsibly manage the public finances. In her conference speech, Badenoch claimed the Conservative Party was ""fizzing with ideas"" to fix the ""broken model"" she said was holding the country back. She pledged to scrap a string of government policies - from new employment rights to VAT on private school fees. And she ran through some of the big policy announcements the party has made this week, including: Her promise to end the ""family farm tax"" got a big cheer in the hall, and her proposals to slash welfare spending and take the UK out of the European Convention on Human Rights also went down well. In a sustained attack on the Labour government, she said: ""All they have delivered is a doom loop of higher taxes, weaker borders, and month after month of chaos. ""They had a plan to win, but no plan for power. ""No vision for Britain. They know how to make promises, but not how to deliver them."" Acknowledging the Conservatives' dire opinion poll ratings and recent local election losses, she said voters were ""still angry"" with her party. And in a swipe at Reform, she said this had led to ""parties that in normal times would never be seen as a serious option for government are gaining ground, making promises they will never be able to keep"". But the speech was chiefly aimed at emphasising that the Conservative Party is under new leadership - one that was prepared to make the ""bold"" and ""tough"" decisions that her opponents would not.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c20zv94ldpko,Politics,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/3560/live/3eedd230-a444-11f0-928c-71dbb8619e94.jpg,2025-10-08T18:50:53.146000+00:00,2eb6148260cca3329dba90ec2845408cb1f94215
bbb0d618f257,Reform UK removes posts after Labour legal threat,,"Reform UK removes posts after Labour legal threat Jacob Morris Newyddion S4C BBC Reform UK confirmed the posts have since been removed from its social media accounts. Reform UK has deleted social media posts after receiving a legal letter from the Labour Party. Addressed to Llŷr Powell, Reform UK's by-election candidate, the letter accused Reform of using copyrighted images in its material for the Caerphilly by-election. On 7 October, Labour gave the party 24 hours to remove an image featuring the first minister and candidate Richard Tunnicliffe, warning that failure to do so could lead to legal proceedings. Reform UK confirmed the posts have since been removed from its social media accounts. The move follows a row last week, when Reform UK sent its own legal letter to Welsh Labour , citing the Defamation Act 2013 and the Representation of the People Act 1983. The letter came after online posts appeared to link candidate Llŷr Powell to Russian president Vladimir Putin - an accusation the party strongly denies. Reform also objected to references that suggested former Reform Wales leader Nathan Gill had taken bribes. Last month, the 52-year-old from Llangefni, Anglesey, admitted eight counts of bribery between 6 December 2018 and 18 July 2019. The dispute comes ahead of the Caerphilly by-election on 23 October, where the candidates are: Richard Tunnicliffe (Welsh Labour), Lindsay Whittle (Plaid Cymru), Gareth Potter (Welsh Conservatives), Llŷr Powell (Reform UK), Gareth Hughes (Wales Green Party) Steven Aicheler (Welsh Liberal Democrats), Roger Quilliam (UKIP), Anthony Cook (Gwlad).",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx203vp909go,Politics,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/1bb6/live/d0865cf0-a479-11f0-b741-177e3e2c2fc7.jpg,2025-10-09T07:48:08.741000+00:00,5b28432c1dc2fa22ac934840f3807f9b0b6e5970
3dc82d219481,Five ways abolishing stamp duty could change the housing market,,"Five ways abolishing stamp duty could change the housing market Kevin Peachey Cost of living correspondent Getty Images The debate around stamp duty is intensifying. When Kemi Badenoch said a future Conservative government would abolish it on the purchase of main homes, it went down well at the Tory Party conference . There has also been speculation that the Chancellor, Rachel Reeves, is considering replacing it. Scrapping stamp duty would be popular among some home buyers, including first-time buyers. There's been widespread support in the housing sector as well as among some independent economists. Analysts say there would be some significant consequences of scrapping stamp duty for primary residences, affecting buyers, sellers and the wider UK economy. 1. House prices might rise Whenever there has been a temporary easing of stamp duty, such as in the immediate aftermath of the Covid lockdowns, house prices have then risen. It is more difficult to judge whether a permanent abolition would have the same long-term impact on prices as the short-term sweetener of a stamp duty holiday. However, greater demand is likely to feed through to asking prices. ""If, and this is a big if, it is a simple tax giveaway, the likelihood is that the current stamp duty bill simply passes through into prices,"" says Lucian Cook, head of residential research at Savills. In turn, that could mean first-time buyers paying less in stamp duty, but having to find a bigger deposit. ""Given the way stamp duty works, this would be unevenly distributed across the country,"" Mr Cook adds. The most obvious point here is that the government in Westminster can only control stamp duty in England and Northern Ireland. Scotland and Wales have their own land and transaction taxes overseen by the devolved administrations. 2. Tax cut for wealthy A swathe of first-time buyers do not pay stamp duty. That's because, in England and Northern Ireland, they are exempt when buying properties of up to £300,000 . ""For them, the enormous challenge is raising a deposit,"" says Sarah Coles, head of personal finance at investment platform Hargreaves Lansdown. Data from property portal Rightmove suggests that 40% of homes for sale in England are stamp duty free for first-time buyers. While the vast majority of movers pay stamp duty, the rate increases at certain price thresholds . So, the bigger the home, the bigger the benefit, if stamp duty was scrapped. This will also mean a big regional difference in the impact of such a policy. At the moment, 76% of properties on sale in the North East of England are free of stamp duty for first-time buyers, according to Rightmove's figures. In London, it is only 11%. Richard Donnell, from Zoopla, points out that 60% of all stamp duty is paid in southern England - so the majority of the benefit of abolition would be felt in the south. 3. Easier to find somewhere to move to One of the great selling points of stamp duty abolition is the extra mobility it should provide for workers, buyers, sellers and downsizers, according to experts. ""Homeownership is the foundation of a fairer and more secure society - but stamp duty has denied that opportunity to too many for too long,"" says Paula Higgins, chief executive of the Homeowners Alliance. ""Our research shows over 800,000 homeowners have shelved moving plans in the past two years, and stamp duty is a major barrier."" The Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS), an independent economic think tank, describes stamp duty as ""one of the most economically damaging taxes"". In its most recent analysis, it says particular winners will be those who want to move frequently, to more or less expensive homes. It should, for example, clear an obstacle for older homeowners, who want to sell a family home but are discouraged by stamp duty. If they are more likely to move, then their homes become available to younger families and the whole market becomes more fluid. However, others suggest the influence of stamp duty could be overblown. ""Take someone downsizing, from a £750,000 property to a £300,000 one. In England and Northern Ireland, they'd pay £5,000 in stamp duty. It's a fraction of what they're likely to pay in estate agency fees, and sits along a huge range of costs from conveyancing to removals,"" Ms Coles from Hargreaves Lansdown says. ""It begs the question of whether removing the cost of the tax is a gamechanger."" 4. Potential tax rises elsewhere Stamp duty raises a lot of money for the Treasury, so scrapping it would leave a gap in the public finances. The IFS said that the direct cost of the Conservative policy might be around £10.5bn to £11bn in 2029-30, although the Tories' own estimate is about £9bn. The question for any administration tempted to scrap or reduce stamp duty is how else it finds the money. The Conservatives say they will make savings elsewhere. They also say the policy will boost growth and the housing sector in general, and therefore bring in more tax receipts. The other option is to raise other taxes. As some analysts have said, the main consideration is not what is scrapped, but what replaces it. 5. Impact on renters The idea of scrapping stamp duty for primary residences will benefit homeowners but could end up meaning less choice for renters. The IFS suggests it could discourage the purchase of rental properties by landlords, as they would still have to pay stamp duty. The think tank says it would increase the more favourable tax treatment of owner-occupation relative to renting.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c9v7wppzm2ro,Politics,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/e48c/live/cdb688c0-a4f5-11f0-8e74-1f6664d312e9.jpg,2025-10-09T17:35:08.858000+00:00,24e0ad8aeb1bec8bbc80e47f94d62a9421410940
d3bc42e292f4,What are National Insurance and income tax and what could change in the Budget?,,"What are National Insurance and income tax and what could change in the Budget? Getty Images There has been speculation that November's Budget could see Chancellor Rachel Reeves break Labour's pre-election pledge not to increase income tax, National Insurance (NI) or VAT for working people. It's been suggested that she could extend a freeze to the income thresholds at which people start paying the taxes, or have to pay more. What is National Insurance and what does it pay for? The government uses National Insurance to pay benefits and help fund the NHS. It is paid by employees, employers and the self-employed across the UK. Those over the state pension age do not pay it, even if they are working. Eligibility for some benefits, including the state pension, depends on the National Insurance contributions (NICs) you make across your working life. It may be possible to make voluntary payments to fill gaps in your contribution history. How much do employees pay in National Insurance? The type and amount of NI you pay depends on your age, employment status and income. Workers start paying NI when they turn 16 and earn more than £242 a week, or have self-employed profits of more than £12,570 a year. The amount owed is usually deducted automatically from employees' wages along with income tax. The starting rate for NI for employees fell twice in 2024: from 12% to 10%, and then again to 8%. The previous Conservative government said these cuts were worth about £900 a year for a worker earning £35,000. For the self-employed , the rate of NI paid on all earnings between £12,570 and £50,270 fell from 9% to 6%. This was said to be worth £350 to a self-employed person earning £28,200. Most self-employed people pay their NICs through their self assessment tax return . The NI rate on income and profits above £50,270 is 2% for all workers. How much do employers pay in National Insurance? Since April 2025, employers pay NI at 15% on most employees' wages above £5,000. They previously paid 13.8% on salaries above £9,100. Businesses also pay 15% NI on expenses and benefits they give to their staff - such as company cars or health insurance. The employment allowance - the amount employers can claim back from their NI bill - rose from £5,000 to £10,500. What are the current income tax rates? You have to pay income tax on your earnings from employment, or profits from self-employment, above the tax-free personal allowance of £12,570. Income tax is also paid on some benefits and pensions , income from renting out property, and returns from savings and investments above certain limits. The basic rate of 20% is paid on annual earnings between £12,571 and £50,270. The higher rate of 40% is paid on earnings between £50,271 and £125,140. Once you earn more than £100,000, you also start losing the £12,570 tax-free personal allowance . You lose £1 of your personal allowance for every £2 that your income goes above £100,000. Anyone earning more than £125,140 a year no longer has any tax-free personal allowance. They also pay an additional rate of income tax of 45% on all earnings above that amount. These rates apply in England, Wales and Northern Ireland. Some income tax rates are different in Scotland , where a new 45% band took effect in April 2024. At the same time the top rate also rose from 47% to 48%. What are NI and income tax thresholds and why do they matter? Changes to the income thresholds mean that millions are paying more tax overall, despite the 2024 NI cuts. The thresholds are the income levels at which people start paying NI or income tax, or have to pay higher rates. These used to rise every year in line with inflation. However, the previous Conservative government froze the NI threshold and tax-free personal allowance at £12,570 until 2028.  It also kept the higher-rate tax threshold at £50,270. Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer and the chancellor have both refused to rule out extending the current freeze. Freezing the thresholds means that more people start paying tax and NI as their wages increase, and more people pay higher rates. According to the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) think thank, the freeze cancelled out the benefits of the 2024 NI cuts for some workers. In the 2024-25 tax year, it said an average earner would have a tax cut of about £340 - from the combined tax changes - and people earning between £26,000 and £60,000 would be better off. But by 2027, it said the average earner would be only £140 better off - and only people earning between £32,000 and £55,000 a year would still benefit.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c62q51vl18yo,Politics,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/d97b/live/fd25fee0-9f93-11f0-b9ae-cbef91e6ae73.jpg,2025-10-10T11:20:32.625000+00:00,34e24c994f13b36c8695c045fbce17ffa3b293c8

Nigel Farage's party also wants out of the ECHR, as well as other international treaties that he thinks stand in the way of curbing illegal immigration. Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey, meanwhile, has been just as strident the other way. ""Kemi Badenoch has chosen to back Nigel Farage and join Vladimir Putin,"" he declared - adding ""this will do nothing to stop the boats or fix our broken immigration system"". EPA Kemi Badenoch pledged to pull out if the Conservatives win the election, but there are many unanswered questions about the consequences Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has weighed in, though he hovers somewhere in between. He told the BBC he does not want to ""tear down"" human rights laws, but backs changing how international law is interpreted to stop unsuccessful asylum seekers blocking their deportation. But while strongly-worded opinions over whether or not to pull out of the treaty make for easy headlines, the consequences are deeply complicated. Even Badenoch acknowledged last year that leaving would not be a ""silver bullet"" for tackling immigration. So how is it that such a nuanced issue has been reduced to a political hot potato? Dodging political bullets It was back in 2011 - not far into David Cameron's tenure as prime minister - that this issue came to the forefront of domestic politics. It centred around the case of John Hirst, a man convicted of manslaughter, who argued the UK's blanket ban on prisoners voting in any circumstances was a breach of human rights. In 2005 Strasbourg had ruled in his favour. It essentially said the UK's policy was too black and white. Cameron's Labour predecessors Tony Blair and Gordon Brown dodged the political bullet of being seen to give in to the court. But when the relatively new Tory PM said he felt ""physically ill"" at the prospect of giving jailed criminals the vote, his soundbite propelled the ECHR to the heart of public consciousness. Getty Images David Cameron said he felt ""physically ill"" at the prospect of giving jailed criminals the vote The ECHR had been largely drafted by a British team and aimed to impose on post-fascist Europe a ""never-again"" package of legal rights. Its content drew heavily on historic laws - for example the concept of Habeas Corpus (banning unlawful detention), can be seen in the ECHR's Article 5. Officially, the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg polices those rights. And when it rules that a country is in breach, the member states come together to find a way of fixing the problem in the Council of Europe (nothing to do with the EU). But in the UK, there is also the Human Rights Act, which means ECHR cases can be dealt with by its own judges. Disputes between UK courts and Strasbourg can be worked through too - what happened following the John Hirst case is testament to this. In 2017, ministers allowed offenders who had been released on licence the right to vote - but made clear that Parliament would never allow votes for criminals still in prison cells. The Council of Europe closed the case. And just weeks ago the Strasbourg court threw out a fresh attempt by a prisoner to re-open the issue. Yet it was the original clash, together with Cameron's comments in 2011, that stuck in many minds. PA Media Starmer does not want to ""tear down"" human rights laws, but backs changing certain aspects around how international law is interpreted Adding fuel to the fire that same year, Theresa May - home secretary at the time - shared a story during party conference about a Bolivian man who avoided deportation because of his pet cat. This illustrated the problem with human rights laws, she argued. Only the story, as May told it, wasn't entirely correct , according to England's top judges. The Home Office indeed wanted to send the man home as an illegal immigrant. And the cat - called Maya - had featured in the man's appeal. But that was only a tiny part of the detailed evidence he provided. A spokesperson for the Judicial Office at the Royal Courts of Justice, which issues statements on behalf of senior judges, said at the time that the cat was ""nothing to do with"" the eventual judgement, which allowed the man to stay. Yet the pet became a source of unintentional humour - and when a judge cracked a joke about the cat no longer needing to fear adapting to Bolivian mice, the case took on a life of its own. By that autumn, a mood had begun to take hold about human rights that, 14 years later, has culminated in the Conservatives pledging to leave the ECHR. 'Open-ended and obscure obligations' Richard Ekins KC is a law professor at the University of Oxford and his thinking on “judicial power” for the Policy Exchange think tank has been hugely influential on the right of British politics. He is a staunch critic of the ECHR on the basis that membership in his view compromises UK sovereignty. ""But there is a more fundamental problem,"" he argues. ""And the fundamental problem can be observed by paying attention to what the court has been doing, which really is quite openly to expand the Convention's reach over time."" He references a case last year, where the court ruled that Switzerland had breached human rights by failing to tackle climate change. The incredibly complex judgement was celebrated by campaigners as a game-changer - but a British judge, Tim Eicke KC, said the majority on the panel had ""gone beyond what it is legitimate and permissible for this court to do"". Getty Images The European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg polices those rights set out in the convention ""The judgment… imposes very far reaching, but also open ended and obscure obligations on member states,"" argues Prof Ekins. ""Domestic courts are going to be invited to apply the European Court's new approach to discipline, supervise [and] control climate policy, which obviously is a highly complicated and tangled set of considerations that intersect with social policy, economic policy, foreign policy."" This is the heart of his argument: a court completely divorced from the political will of the British people is now making the UK do things that are far beyond its original remit. ""It's incompatible - its intention at least - with parliamentary democracy,"" he argues. Hijacked by the immigration debate Nowhere is the allegation of overreach stronger in British politics than in Reform's claim that the ECHR is to blame for problems with the UK's migration system. Yet the evidence supporting this claim is often anecdotal and complex - as was the case with Maya the cat. A study of media stories about the ECHR by the University of Oxford's Bonavero Institute for Human Rights found that fewer than 1% of all foreign criminals who have appealed against their deportation in the UK have won their case on human rights grounds. When cases went as far as Strasbourg, the court tended to throw them out. PA Media Reform's claim that the ECHR is to blame for problems with the UK's migration system is based on evidence that is often anecdotal and complex That's not to say there are no issues at all. Lord Jonathan Sumption, the former Supreme Court judge, believes that some decisions by immigration tribunal judges have become ""extravagant"" and far removed from the original boundaries of the right to family life. ""I have no problem about the text of the Convention,"" he says. ""I do have a problem about the unlimited expansion which it's undergone at the hands of the Strasbourg Court. ""It's unfortunate that the whole issue has been hijacked by the question of immigration. ""I think that it will make some difference to the ability to keep people out or deport them if we are not members of the ECHR. But I think the extent that it will make a difference is not widely understood - and has been greatly exaggerated."" Would leaving 'stop the boats'? So, would leaving the ECHR really ""stop the boats"", to use Rishi Sunak's phrase? ""The number one problem about deporting illegal immigrants, first of all, is finding a place which will take them and which is not unsafe,"" argues Lord Sumption. ""And secondly, [there is] the Refugee Convention. It doesn't require us to take in asylum seekers. It does require us to adjudicate on their claims and give them certain rights once they've got here, even if they got here illegally. ""The ECHR is certainly an additional difficulty, but not as great a difficulty, as is suggested."" Getty Images Lord Sumption: 'I think the extent that [it would] make a difference has been greatly exaggerated' The UK government has already promised to devise clearer and stricter rules that will tell immigration officials and judges how to interpret the right to family life. ""I think it is a runner,"" argues Sir Jonathan Jones, who was the Treasury Solicitor until 2020. This, he believes, could be the best way forward - particularly around the definition of the ECHR's Article 8, which guarantees the right to, among other things, family life. ""It's legitimate for the government to say we will take a tighter view, as a proper, reasoned, good faith attempt to rein in what we think Article 8 covers and what it doesn't."" But Alex Chalk, the last Conservative Lord Chancellor before Labour won power, argues that the UK government needs to seek reform faster. ""The ECHR is not holy writ,"" he told the BBC during the Conservative party conference. ""This government should be moving much more quickly to seek urgent reform. [It] should have been saying, look, we want to lead on this to do this in six weeks. ""The US Constitution was drafted in 15 weeks or so. This really can be done."" 'Rights are going to suffer' Human rights lawyer Harriet Wistrich is concerned about what could be lost if the UK does leave the ECHR. It has, she argues, been at the forefront of challenging the state's treatment of victims of awful abuses. ""We were able to hold Greater Manchester Police accountable on behalf of Rochdale grooming gang victims through civil [damages] proceedings. ""The Hillsborough inquests were possible by having Article 2 [the right to life] inquiries into deaths, where you want to examine what went wrong and what the state could have done differently. ""If we withdraw fully… it's those rights that are going to suffer,"" says Ms Wistrich, who is also the founder of the Centre for Women's Justice. EPA In May, nine nations called for ECHR reform over migration law. Their open letter - which the UK did not sign - called for states to have greater freedom over who to kick out Beyond legal battles at home, there are big international questions too around leaving. The 1998 Belfast Agreement, the cornerstone of peace in Northern Ireland, and the post-Brexit deal with the European Union placed respect for human rights law at their centre. Critics of withdrawing from the EHCR predict both could come crashing down. But Professor Ekins believes that you can have human rights safeguards without a supranational court overseeing all nations. He and colleagues wrote a detailed proposal on Northern Ireland that argue the historic arrangements don't require the UK to remain in the ECHR, providing it honours human rights and cross-community power-sharing arrangements by other means. James Manning/PA Wire Leaving the ECHR 'will do nothing to stop the boats or fix our broken immigration system,' Sir Ed Davey argued The issues in Northern Ireland and the Republic could, however, go deeper. Sir Jonathan Jones for one is sceptical about how leaving the ECHR would go down in both places - because the ECHR's role in the agreement was to demonstrate to a lot of people who do not trust the British state that there are laws in place to protect them. Without it, whoever has a majority in the Commons would be able to do whatever they wanted, thanks to the ""winner takes all"" reality of how our constitution works. ""The thing about the Convention is that it constrains governments, and it constrains the way that governments can treat minorities and people it doesn't like,"" he says. ""If we were out of the ECHR, you wouldn't have that constraint."" Alex Chalk warns there could be an international price to leaving, too. There is value, he says, in sitting at the Council of Europe and raising issues with French and German counterparts at international conferences. ""You should try to reform before you yank your way out because inevitably there could be cost to doing so,"" he argues. But ultimately, he adds, ""this is a matter of politics more than it is of law"".

074254cd4834,Bleak reality of opposition sets in for Conservatives,,"Before us, there is a battalion of unemployed chairs. For the Conservatives right now, the fight even to be listened to is not easy. The speech by the shadow chancellor Sir Mel Stride is one of the big set-piece moments of this conference. And yet there were countless empty seats in a modestly sized hall. Next door, in the exhibition centre, there are swathes of empty blue carpet. Some of the fringe events exploring the party's future have been standing room only. But not in the main hall. This party, so often and for so long the dominating force in British politics, is a shrivelled version of its usual self. They have not had a conference like this in more than a quarter of a century. Granted, they were in opposition this time last year too. But many attendees then will have signed up before they knew about that – the general election could have come after it. Plus, 12 months ago, there was a survivors' elation vibe about their proceedings: a leadership election was underway and members of any political party tend to revel in a battle of ideas and personalities, almost whatever the circumstances. This year, the bleak reality of opposition has set in. Even back in 1998, a year and a bit into their last big stint in opposition, they were the principal voice in opposition to a big majority government. Not so now. A year and a bit on from a cataclysmic election defeat, the Tories have become more unpopular. It is Reform UK that have momentum, a sustained lead in the opinion polls and a recent track record of election victories, albeit a very long way away from a general election. In the weeks prior to the Conservatives gathering in Manchester, there has been a steady drip drip of former Tories joining Nigel Farage, some with the parting rhetorical gift of claiming their old party is finished. It is not an entirely downcast mood here though. Perhaps by definition those who have turned up are still up for the scrap ahead. The party has decided to embark on a blitz of policy announcements, after a year in which they have endured a recession in attention amid the boom in interest in Reform. What they want you to notice is their pitch to be seen as economically credible. They want to shrink the state by around £50bn by cutting benefits, cutting foreign aid and cutting the civil service. Most of that money saved would be spent paying down the deficit, but some would go on eye-catching policies like scrapping business rates in England and helping young people save to buy a home . Yet the ghost of Liz Truss lingers: despite their best efforts to politely disown her, the Conservatives' opponents will probably never lose their appetite for reminding voters of the calamity of her brief premiership . And for Kemi Badenoch, the challenge is being noticed – and persuading her party to keep her in her job. Her rivals, Sir Keir Starmer, Reform leader Nigel Farage and the Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey have all been around for longer and are all likely better known. Filling those empty chairs, commanding attention is just the beginning of the task she confronts. Has there ever been a tougher time in modern history for the Conservative Party? I'm not sure there has.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c62ne9yz37go,Politics,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/ea50/live/b06730f0-a2d2-11f0-92db-77261a15b9d2.jpg,2025-10-06T16:25:19.948000+00:00,bcb9d3ab92f89df1475051214b94c462e3bfe026
32ea352a35d5,Why time matters for Tory MPs deciding Kemi Badenoch's future,,"Why time matters for Tory MPs deciding Kemi Badenoch's future Matt Chorley 5 Live presenter PA Media Louis Armstrong had all of it in the world. The Beautiful South needed a little more. For Kemi Badenoch, and her 118 MPs, time is also on their minds. The Conservative leader believes she needs more time, to turn around her party from its historic drubbing in last year's general election. Yet as time's gone on, she's gone further down in the polls. ""I didn't say it would be easy,"" she told Tory members on Sunday. ""And I didn't say it would be quick."" For her MPs - and I've contacted almost all of them for my BBC Radio 5 Live show via text and WhatsApp over the last few days - time is of the essence, and for some, it is already running out. Around one in three Tory MPs responded to my questions about the mood of the party, and the pressure Badenoch is under. They break down roughly into two camps. In the first are those who think the next election is a considerable way off and want Badenoch to be given space to try to repair damage not all of her own making. The mood, they insist, is better than much of the media speculation. ""Chipper"", even. They take comfort from Labour's own woes and leadership speculation, and cling to a belief that Reform UK's populist policies increasingly do not survive contact with reality. ""There's a gallows humour about the party, a 'well it can't get any worse, can it?' strange jovialness which is kind of bonding,"" says one Tory MP. Several texts I received suggested Badenoch had bought herself more time in office, perhaps months, with a single performance at Prime Minister's Questions last month , when she challenged Keir Starmer over what he knew about the friendship between his US ambassador, Peter Mandelson, and convicted paedophile Jeffrey Epstein. One former cabinet minister said: ""The Mandelson PMQs was a turning point. She smashed it. ""That one half hour has probably bought her another six months of grace in the job. She doesn't need to learn the same lesson twice. Giving her time and space is starting to pay dividends."" And then there is the second camp who think the clock is ticking: on her leadership and on the long-term viability of what used to be called the world's oldest and most successful political party. They grumble, especially those elected for the first time last year, about a leader's office lacking in direction, fight, even a willingness to acknowledge their existence. ""It's not that we're not getting listened to as a party,"" says one 2024 Tory MP. ""It's that we've nothing to say. We're too timid, we think we're in government still and are fretting about costing things that we'll never have to worry about if we keep on launching commissions and our best pushback against Reform is 'That's not costed, you know'."" In recent weeks, stung by criticism that she was aloof from her MPs, Badenoch has begun inviting in small groups for lunch. Well, platters of shop-bought sandwiches. When I pointed out to one invitee that Badenoch famously declared last year that she hated sandwiches (in line with just 1% of the British public), they replied ""oh no, the MPs had sandwiches, Kemi had something hot brought in"". Some tell me privately that the looming date of 2 November, when Badenoch will have been in office for a year and therefore open to a confidence vote, is ""focusing minds"" in the leader's office. ""She needs to have a very impactful conference in order to stave off a confidence vote before the end of the year in my view,"" says one MP. ""There's a whiff of fatality in the air because of the polls."" So how much time does she have? Next year's elections to the Scottish Parliament, Welsh Senedd and many English councils are shaping up to be ""the moment of truth"", according to some of her MPs. (Labour MPs were saying similar things to me about Keir Starmer last week.) One member of Badenoch's own frontbench, who closely monitors the mood of the party, texts me bluntly: ""She is under unbelievable pressure. This will be her last conference as leader."" When I expressed some surprise at the prediction, the MP quickly responded: ""I like Kemi and I think we should stick with the leader we have so I hope I'm completely wrong."" Others are more convinced that her time is running out. One Conservative who publicly backed Badenoch in last year's leadership contest told me: ""Kemi's time as leader could end by Christmas rather than after the May elections. ""Ultimately unpredictable, and how conference goes will shape the outcome, but conference, and post conference polls, are undoubtedly pivotal."" Whatever the merits of having someone different in charge – and many see Robert Jenrick waiting in the wings – it risks exposing the Tories once again to the most damaging of political forces: ridicule. One grandee tells me: ""We need to regain our senses and remember we were totally thrashed last summer and have not yet been forgiven. More shenanigans won't help."" A shadow minister agrees: ""This conference is super important. People and members want direction and messaging and so this is Kemi's moment. She can't squander it - she needs to show why we are the sensible option on the right and a genuine force still. ""If she doesn't deliver it could be curtains but most MPs I speak to want this to work. There is too much PTSD from the last five years."" A former cabinet minister says: ""The Tories will start to make progress - and it will be on the economy – after enough time has passed since our crushing defeat and the public feel enough water under the bridge since that defeat."" Another says: ""When the country is ready to listen to us again (a year hence maybe?), we'll show that we are totally unified, have some great people and the right ideas."" One MP who has been in the Commons for two decades says: ""No one is expecting instant miracles nor is there urgent appetite for a coup."" PA Media Kemi Badenoch defeated rivals Robert Jenrick, James Cleverly and Tom Tugendhat in the 2024 leadership election in Birmingham Some note that she is very much the new kid on the block: Farage has been an elected politician on and off for more than quarter of a century. Starmer has been leader for almost six years. Even Sir Ed Davey, the Lib Dem leader, was a minister in the coalition government 15 years ago. Being unknown means voters struggle to work out what she is about, but it also presents an opportunity to move beyond the last Tory government and appear new and fresh. Talk continues about what to do about Reform. Will some sort of deal have to be made? A merger? A pact? A takeover? Whatever, the Tories need to be in a stronger position before it can think about such a negotiation. There is also a theory that's taken hold in Conservative thinking that part of their predicament is the fault of Keir Starmer. ""Usually the opposition would have longer but the government collapse in popularity has happened so quickly it has sharpened focus on needing to have an alternative narrative,"" one Tory MP, first elected in 2024, said. ""It is hard to look like a renewed party though when so many of the key people are well known from the last government when it was comprehensively dumped from power."" Some declare her party conference pledge to repeal the Climate Change Act a ""gamechanger"". Others say the same of a promise to leave the European Convention on Human Rights. What is not always clear is if they actually expect it to change the game, or merely hope it might. Badenoch and her team are being urged to ""quickly set out a bold, uncompromisingly honest, radical 'Maggie 2.0' program of reform, on tax, small business, immigration and welfare, to tackle the grievances Farage is feeding on"". EPA Three display cabinets at Conservative party conference holding outfits worn by Margaret Thatcher Ah yes, Maggie. Margaret Thatcher. She would have turned 100 this month, but the former prime minister still haunts this conference and this party. Sir Iain Duncan Smith, who took over as leader of the Conservatives after their 2001 election defeat before being ousted two years later, told me: ""I think it's a very difficult time for anyone to be leader. ""The Conservative party has a messiah complex, thinking some messiah will suddenly appear and lead us to the promised land. ""They look back to Margaret Thatcher and think she arrived as a fully-formed messiah to save the party and the country. In fact, when she arrived some people thought 'this is a disaster'. People said she was shrill, weak, difficult. It took her time for her strength of character and intellect to dominate and for her to become the leader she was. ""Kemi has that capability and needs time too. Otherwise we risk confirming people's view of us from our behaviour during the last government that we are fratricidal and not to be trusted."" In the conference exhibition hall in Manchester there is a lot of Thatcher merchandise - and a glass display case holding the burgundy wool suit she wore on the day she left Downing Street - a monument to the moment a female Tory leader was ousted by her colleagues because they believed she was doing more harm than good. After this conference week in Manchester we might have a clearer idea if Tory MPs are ready to do that particular Time Warp again.

43c9596e4810,The battle for Scotland's flag: Why the right has adopted the saltire,,"The battle for Scotland's flag: Why the right has adopted the saltire James Cook Scotland editor Getty Images Something has shifted in Scotland. The saltire, which was long embraced by supporters of Scottish independence, has now been unfurled for a different cause. Up and down the land, the blue and white of St Andrew is fluttering from lampposts and being waved alongside the union flag at anti-immigration protests. Until recently those two standards were more often seen on different sides of the debate about Scotland's future. Now the saltire's presence is generating controversy of its own at demonstrations from Perth to Aberdeen and from Glasgow to Falkirk, where the latest rally was held on Wednesday evening. This battle for Scotland's flag is also a battle about what it means to be a patriot in modern Scotland - a battle of competing nationalisms. Steven Rennie addresses a rally outside Glasgow Royal Concert Hall Steven Rennie is one of the prominent figures in these recent protests. He blends opposition to independence and immigration with sharp criticism of the Scottish National Party - which is in favour of both. I stood within a few feet of Mr Rennie as he addressed hundreds of supporters in the centre of Glasgow in late September. With his shoulders wrapped in the red, white and blue of the union flag, he spoke of the saltire. ""They claimed our national flag as their own and for 12 long years we've allowed them to wield it as a weapon of division and hate. ""But no more. We have reclaimed our flag, our identity, our pride and also our resolve,"" he said. Those on opposing sides of the debate have made their feelings known at protests The crowd - separated from hundreds of counter-protesters by a line of police officers - cheered the denunciation of the SNP whose leaders, in a referendum 11 years ago , failed to persuade a majority of Scottish voters to opt to leave the UK. ""The SNP has wreaked havoc on our nation, dismantling our prosperity and our potential at every turn, replacing us with new Scots and putting our own people at the bottom of the pile,"" said Mr Rennie. ""New Scots"" is a welcoming term used by Scottish government ministers who are keen to attract more foreign workers to help grow an economy which is challenged by a record low birth rate . The SNP has run the devolved government in Edinburgh since 2007 but immigration remains the responsibility of the UK government in London - and it has rejected calls for a separate Scottish visa system . Getty Images There was a counter-protest to the demonstration on Falkirk in August Migration is a thorn in the side for Labour Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer and appears to be rising up the agenda ahead of the Scottish parliamentary elections next spring. The small boats crisis and the accommodation of asylum seekers in hotels , which Sir Keir has promised to phase out, have fuelled demonstrations around the UK. That includes protests in Falkirk, where a building which was once a three-star hotel is being used to house migrants. One protester, who gave his name as Mark, held a union flag emblazoned with ""Stop the Boats"". He said politicians should be fixing ailing public services, not spending taxpayers' money on medical and dental care for asylum seekers. Mark was one of the protesters in Falkirk ""We're sick of these people rolling up in boats, getting four-star hotels,"" he told me. ""They're getting their three meals a day while Britain's services suffer. We're just sick of it and Starmer is not doing enough to try and stop it."" Minutes earlier one of the speakers had shouted: ""Keep Britain white. Keep Scotland white. Keep Scotland Scottish."" Mark insisted the man did not speak for him, and that the protest was ""nothing to do with racism"". Outside the hotel a group of counter-protesters, including many trade unionists, had gathered. They too were critical of the prime minister – but for different reasons. They accused him of pandering to the far right. Getty Images Counter-protesters demonstrated against a rally protesting about immigration in Glasgow earlier this month The two camps appear to share a sense of disgust about the UK's ailing economy and the poor state of public services - although they do not necessarily agree on the causes or the solutions. ""The real issue in our society is the people in government who aren't tackling these issues head on, not people fleeing persecution trying to find a better place to live,"" said a counter protester in Falkirk, who gave her name as Sage. Referring to the anti-asylum seeker protest across the road, she said: ""I don't blame these people for falling for these narratives, because everyone is suffering. ""It doesn't matter what side of the political spectrum we're on, everyone is going through it."" The real problem, insisted Sage, was billionaires making record profits and not paying enough tax. ""We know who is underfunding our services. It's not migrants and refugees,"" she said. One recurring complaint among protesters is about the number of migrants being housed at local authority expense. The issue is most acute in Glasgow, which has the UK's highest number of refugees in council accommodation. Asylum seekers are housed by the UK Home Office but, after they are granted leave to remain and become refugees, that support quickly expires. At that point, many become homeless and, because Scottish councils have a statutory duty to house all homeless people, they must step in. ""Essentially, we have run out of temporary accommodation,"" said Glasgow City Council leader Susan Aitken. ""We don't have anywhere to put all of these people who are now declaring themselves homeless in the city, and we're having to put them up in hotels, and that's very, very expensive."" Getty Images Protesters in Falkirk said they were opposed to housing asylum seekers in the town The SNP councillor for Langside wants the UK government to step in but is at pains to stress that refugees do not have priority over anyone else. Aitken added: ""Anyone who is telling you that asylum seekers and refugees are prioritised by the SNP, by the Scottish government, or by this council is lying to you. It is simply not true."" Still, some hostility to immigrants persists and migration has risen up the list of Scottish voters' concerns as flags have appeared on lampposts around the country. Hundreds of saltires have gone up in working class communities such as those in north and east Glasgow; Sighthill in Edinburgh; and Falkirk's Westfield. Shawn, a refugee who lives in north Glasgow, believes the saltire usually represents peace, harmony and inclusion - but says it is now being flown ""for the far-right and racism"". The former police officer and his mother Mala successfully sought asylum in the UK after they fled their South East Asian homeland in circumstances they asked not to discuss in public for their own safety. Shawn said he had experienced racism on the streets of Glasgow Shawn, who runs a community organisation called the Springburn Unity Network, said he had been subjected to racist insults in Glasgow and knew immigrants who were afraid to leave their homes because of the recent protests. Debates about flags are not just raging in Scotland's big cities and working class towns. In the prosperous Renfrewshire village of Bridge of Weir, the hoisting of saltires has led to a row on the local Facebook group. In the middle of the village, Dougie Moore told me he approved of the flags because they sent a message to immigrants that ""they should be coming to enjoy our country the way that we enjoy it rather than changing things"". Bunty Singh, who owns a local café and delicatessen, said he had no issue with anyone flying a national flag but also insisted there were no problems with immigration in Bridge of Weir. ""It's a peaceful, lovely village,"" insisted Mr Singh who was born in Glasgow to parents who were originally from India. ""We're happy to be here and we are welcomed here."" Bunty Singh said there were no problems with immigration in Bridge of Weir But at a local community hub Ian Gillies was concerned about the saltires, which he regarded as unwelcoming and divisive. ""I think it's in keeping with the spirit of the age,"" he said. ""'Every man for himself and we don't want anybody else coming our way.' I see the same trend in the States and elsewhere in the continent. It's sad to see it coming here."" Mr Gillies is not the only person to note an Americanisation of politics on this side of the Atlantic in the age of Donald Trump and social media. At the protest in Glasgow where Steven Rennie spoke about the saltire, there were chants, calls and placards in support of right-wing American influencer Charlie Kirk, who had been shot dead days earlier. Later the crowd chanted ""Oh Tommy, Tommy"", in tribute to the convicted criminal and far-right activist Stephen Yaxley-Lennon , who uses the name Tommy Robinson and has been supported by Elon Musk. Getty Images There were tributes to the late right-wing influencer Charlie Kirk at a demonstration in Glasgow Matthew Feldman, a visiting professor at Liverpool Hope University and leading expert on the radical right, said he was concerned that extremism was bleeding into mainstream political debate because overt racism and the glorification of terrorism were ""being given a pass"" on US-owned social media platforms. At the anti-migrant protest in Falkirk, one banner referenced former SNP first minister Humza Yousaf's calls for greater ethnic diversity in Scottish public life in a speech which had been highlighted and criticised by Musk and Reform UK leader Nigel Farage. The same banner went on to quote a white supremacist slogan known as the 14 Words: ""We must secure the existence of our people and a future for white children."" ""The 14 Words actually comes from the eighth chapter of Mein Kampf,"" explained Prof Feldman. He said the slogan was ""a translation of Hitler's sense of Aryan supremacy"" and was popularised in the US in the 1980s by the late white supremacist David Lane. ""It is inconceivable to me that somebody that is writing out that phrase doesn't associate it with white supremacism and, more importantly, with a sort of an anti or racist view towards ethnic and religious minorities,"" added Prof Feldman. Getty Images One banner at a protest in Falkirk contained a white supremacist slogan It was not the only extreme language on display in Falkirk. Another sign read ""Kill 'Em All. Let God Sort 'Em Out,"" a phrase originally associated with a 13th Century Catholic crusade. While not defending the placards, many of the protesters we spoke to insisted they had genuine concerns about the safety of women and children. They pointed to the conviction of an Afghan asylum seeker for raping a 15-year-girl in the town and the arrest of a resident of the asylum hotel on sexual indecency charges, which he denies. Farage has also suggested sexual assault by asylum seekers is a particular problem, a claim described by Glasgow City Council leader Susan Aitken as one of history's oldest and nastiest racist slurs. When I spoke to Farage on a visit to Aberdeen earlier this year he insisted that Reform UK was now a serious contender in Scottish politics. ""I've spent a year going around England campaigning ahead of the English local elections, and perceptions of me and the party have changed over that last year, and I intend to make that happen in Scotland over the next year,"" he told me. That claim may be bolstered by Reform's strong third place in June's Hamilton, Larkhall and Stonehouse by-election , which Labour won. On Wednesday, Scotland's First Minister John Swinney said arguments about immigration were being ""fanned by a wider debate"" going on in the UK and around the globe. The SNP leader told me he believed in a Scotland that was ""tolerant, welcoming and inclusive"" and urged people ""to avoid us being swept down a route of a relentless rightward direction in the United Kingdom"". Swinney added: ""I don't think that's where Scotland wants to be. I don't think that's how Scotland feels. And I want to make sure that people in Scotland realise that there is a danger that we will be carried down that route if we don't take a different course."" Polls ahead of May's Holyrood election suggest a big lead for the SNP, with Reform potentially overtaking the Conservatives to challenge Labour for second place, despite never before having won a seat at Holyrood. Whatever flags are waved by whichever party in the campaign, immigration appears likely to take its place alongside the economy and public services as a big issue.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/clyxqknx7jqo,Politics,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/fe18/live/e1266390-a44a-11f0-b741-177e3e2c2fc7.jpg,2025-10-09T05:23:41.120000+00:00,f00d9d17665b7a7e2ee6de315db240aad28103dd
e598dc3621ee,Can Polanski's Greens turn momentum into power?,,"Can Polanski's Greens turn momentum into power? Sam Francis Political reporter Getty Images In the month since self-proclaimed ""eco-populist"" Zack Polanski took charge of the Green Party of England and Wales, there has been a noticeable change within the party. With over 20,000 new members in recent months, the Green Party is the largest it has ever been. The party appears to be trying to shed its image as well-meaning eco-warriors to become an insurgent force. While there appears to be momentum within the party, in a splintered political landscape there is a question mark over how the Greens can turn this into votes. When campaigning to become Green Party leader, Polanski promised to ""pick fights"". On the eve of his first conference as leader, Polanski was argumentative during an interview on the BBC Radio 4's Today programme when pushed to defend his deputy Mothin Ali over inflammatory comments he had made about an Israeli army reservist. This willingness to create controversy - if it wins attention and cuts through to the public - has been embraced by his party. Boldness is needed to combat voter disillusionment and rising right-wing populism, argues Rachel Millward, Polanski's other deputy co-leader. ""I guess I can't see the point of not going as big as you can go,"" says Millward. ""If we stay timid, we might gain nothing. ""Whereas, if we're bold we definitely gain people because it resonates because it's true and it's real and people are craving that honesty."" The Green Party's head of elections, Chris Williams, oversaw the Greens' best-ever general election campaign last year - it gave the party four MPs for the first time by tailoring and targeting campaigns in both Tory and Labour heartlands. But he is now recalibrating the party's approach to reflects Polanski's leadership style. ""To tailor an old adage: if you try to annoy nobody you don't excite anybody,"" is how he puts it. The Green Party see on opportunity to build on the momentum. With increased belief comes more members, more donations ""the campaigns get bigger, and the targets grow, and we win more seats, and we just build upwards and keep on going"", Williams argues. The UK's shifting electoral landscape, is also bringing growing opportunity, Williams says. ""By-elections are being won with just 27% of the vote. ""The swings we need are smaller - instead of climbing Everest, we're having to climb Snowdon now in order to win a constituency."" The party has already picked a raft of so-called ""development constituencies"" in Tory and Labour held areas across the country, though the targets are predominantly urban where traditional parties like Labour and the Conservatives are shedding votes fastest, Williams says. Some members warn a shift away from localised strategy could risk alienating the very voters who delivered the breakthrough wins in 2024. The party's two current MPs in rural areas could be particularly exposed - ex-leader Adrian Ramsay in Waveney Valley, on the border of Suffolk and Norfolk, and Ellie Chowns in North Herefordshire. Ramsay and Chowns also ran on a joint ticket against Polanski, picking up just 16% of the vote. On the ground, Millward - who co-leads the predominantly rural Wealden District Council - insists the countryside vote is not at risk. ""We've had more new members coming in, even in our rural area,"" Millward says. Getty Images Zack Polanski, Mothin Ali and Rachel Millward (l-r) are set on taking the Green Party in a new direction. For all their ideological differences, the Green Party is watching Reform UK as a case study in how to win attention and turn it into electoral support. A well-attended panel discussion on ""how to stop Reform"" at conference was notable for the number of members praising the work of the Green's foe Nigel Farage. Members argued for copying a playbook of simple messaging, emotional appeal and a willingness to provoke - albeit with different content. In his leader's speech, Polanski said: ""If Reform can rocket through the polls with a politics of despair, then it's time for the Green Party to do the same thing with a politics of hope."" But the Green Party's electoral strategy is being reshaped not just by the rise of Reform UK. There's a risk that Your Party, the emerging political force led by Jeremy Corbyn and Zarah Sultana, could take the wind out of the Green Party's sails. At 82,000 members the Green Party is the biggest it has ever been. For context Your Party claims to have had more than 600,000 sign-ups in the weeks after it launched. For Millward, all this proves is ""Labour's lost its support on the left"". ""And we are actually gaining from that as well - so it's not like a net loss to us."" The Greens have long relied on grassroots energy and volunteer labour. They now have more members to call on, but for a party trying to scale up from protest politics to serious electoral force money matters. Behind the scenes, Millward and others are pushing for a bolder approach to fundraising. She used her conference speech to argue they will be the party of ""fivers"" – emulating the micro-donations successes of US figures like Barak Obama and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. The party also needs to become ""bold enough to ask"" sympathetic donors that have sustained big parties like the Conservatives, Labour and Reform, she says. ""We're not talking about being funded by corruptive billionaires, but there are people who are with us and who would like a change."" The 2026 local elections will be a key test for the Greens. The party is aiming to hold a record 900 council seats when they contest a series of nominal strongholds, in London, Brighton and Huddersfield. The party is also talking up their chances in taking over new combined authority contests in Sussex, and in Norfolk and Suffolk. In Wales, they have high hopes the new proportional representation voting system will allow the party to gain a foothold in the Senedd. But fractured multi-party voting in a first past-the-post electoral system in England and Wales can lead to unpredictable results. It is clear the Green Party leadership see a path to victory. Although some in the party argue that losing the ability to appeal to more conservative areas risks deepening divides, just when many voters want calm and competence, others view it as the price to be paid. What the party must now see is if voters will reward ""picking fights"" with electoral success - or a bloody nose.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c9dx85q4dyzo,Politics,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/193b/live/d6d4a950-a167-11f0-8b70-39bf68f49b3e.jpg,2025-10-05T13:15:26.026000+00:00,13abb7877500137130af79d8f04a8d9e24427f96
e7bc4c86a145,Meet the Caerphilly by-election candidates,,"Meet the Caerphilly by-election candidates Getty Images Caerphilly Castle is the second largest in Britain, behind only Windsor Castle Eight politicians are competing in, arguably, the most interesting by-election in the 26-years of Welsh devolution. They are seeking to represent the constituency of Caerphilly in the Welsh Parliament. Prompted by the sudden death of Labour Senedd member Hefin David in August , the poll takes place on 23 October. Here you can read about all of the candidates, in alphabetical order, and their messages to voters. The details were provided by the political parties and candidates, and reflect their views. Steve Aicheler - Welsh Liberal Democrats Welsh Liberal Democrats Who is he? Steve Aicheler lives in Machen with his family and is a community councillor and school governor. He works for a national non-profit organisation promoting entrepreneurship in education and has founded several local businesses. Steve says he is standing to give Caerphilly a strong, independent voice in the Senedd who puts people first. What are his policies? Fix the social care crisis to free up the Welsh NHS and reduce waiting times. Provide 30 hours of free childcare a week for every child aged nine months to four years, so that every parent in Caerphilly has access to affordable and flexible childcare. Prioritise education, ensuring young people in Wales have equal access to opportunity as young people in England. Bring jobs back to Caerphilly, challenging a Cardiff-centric City Deal that has failed to deliver for local people. Protect local services that are under threat from Labour locally and in the Senedd. Anthony Cook - Gwlad Glenn Whitehouse Who is he? Anthony Cook grew up in Cefn Hengoed, lives in Ystrad Mynach and says his family has been ""part of the Rhymney Valley mining history for generations"". He is a father of three children that he takes on ""adventures over Parc Penallta and Gelligaer Common"" and says that, as a boy, he ""played in the shadow of Penallta colliery and caught the C9 bus to Bargoed to go shopping with my nan in a once thriving high street"". He says he understands the ""struggles that have followed the decline of our traditional industries"". The name of his party, Gwlad, means country in Welsh. What are his policies? Help town centres by building homes, siting public services such as polyclinics (centres for GP surgeries, outpatients and minor injuries) there and encouraging evening shop opening, at least from April to October. Reform VAT; as new build is free of the tax but repair is not, making it cheaper to build new on the outskirts of town rather than restore the old centre. The elected Welsh government should run Wales, not boards and panels of the ""great and the good"" which require additional funding to administer and give ministers a way to evade responsibility. End subsidies for renewable energy schemes such as solar farms that are destroying good agricultural land. Oppose Welsh government funding of politically partisan NGOs (non-governmental organisations), eg those that campaign for men to access women's spaces. Gareth Hughes - Green Party Who is he? Gareth Hughes, who lives in Caerphilly, was born in Bangor and educated at Friars Grammar School, Coleg Harlech and the London School of Economics. He has been an apprentice printer, print journalist, university lecturer, researcher and played a prominent role in the early days of housing associations in Wales. He returned to journalism, with the creation of the National Assembly for Wales in the late 1990s, as an ITV Wales political reporter and commentator, later analysing public life for BBC Radio Wales, Radio Cymru and others. What are his policies? Create green jobs for people where they live. Provide better public services - including more evening bus services and warm, safe housing. Build stronger communities with empowered local voices. Promote a fairer, greener future tackling the climate emergency. Gareth Potter - Welsh Conservatives Welsh Conservatives Who is he? Gareth Potter is married with two children and has lived in Ebbw Vale since last year. Born in Pontypool, he grew up on a Trevethin council estate and attended West Monmouth Comprehensive School. He worked for retailers, including Matalan, then in charity retail with the British Heart Foundation before focusing on politics full-time. He was previously a staff member for Conservative South Wales East Senedd member Natasha Asghar and worked, for the last four years, as a campaign manager for Bristol and South Gloucestershire Conservatives. What are his policies? Scrap business rates for small businesses to allow our forgotten high streets to grow, creating more local jobs and reducing unemployment across Caerphilly and growing tourism. Ban mobile phones in schools by rolling out lockable phone pouches across all schools in Caerphilly and ensure children are automatically excluded for carrying knives into school. Push to extend GP services beyond 09:00 BST to 19:00 and review NHS hospital planning which has seen hospitals like Ysbyty Ystrad Fawr designed for A&E services but instead all A&E going to the Grange in Torfaen 30mins away for residents living just yards from Ystrad Fawr. Scrap Wales' 20mph default speed limit and build an M4 relief road south of Newport to support growth in our town and villages across Caerphilly. Keep local services open while cutting council waste, scrapping the Senedd expansion while initiating an Anti-Waste Action Plan. Llŷr Powell - Reform UK Reform UK Who is he? Llŷr Powell has lived and worked in Caerphilly for the last five years and has called the area home for much of his professional life, aside from a brief hiatus to work in the House of Commons in 2024. He has worked in communications in public, political and charitable organisations, including roles in political communications and public affairs, where he has used his platform to highlight issues facing the left-behind communities of south Wales. He is a fluent Welsh speaker, and describes himself as an enthusiastic supporter of grassroots Welsh rugby and a keen follower of the national side. What are his policies? Protect the NHS, free at the point of delivery, with free prescriptions. Champion shorter waiting lists, more frontline staff, proper funding and an upgrade for Ysbyty Ystrad Fawr. Support local high streets, be a strong voice for Caerphilly's local economy and prioritise attracting much-needed investment to create more opportunities and jobs in this area. End the Nation of Sanctuary policy, which has wasted £55m of taxpayers' money. Fight to keep libraries open as the Labour council wants to close 10 of them while sitting on almost £190m in reserves as council tax keeps rising. Ensure reserves are spent on local communities not wasteful projects. Get Wales moving again by pushing to reverse Labour's 20mph speed limits, which are negatively impacting Caerphilly's economy and putting businesses off investing in the region. Back better and safer transport links. Roger Quilliam - UKIP Roger Quilliam Who is he? Roger Quilliam has been a member of UKIP's National Executive Committee since 2024. The party says he has worked for over two years closely with party leader Nick Tenconi in activism and citizen journalism for UKIP, Turning Point UK, and Disciples of Christ. UKIP says he campaigns against mass immigration, communism, liberalism, and in favour of patriotism, nationalism, and traditionalism and that his core values are rooted in family, community, national identity, justice, and law and order. What are his policies? Abolish the Senedd. Freeze immigration for a minimum of five years. Mass deportations and remigration. Reinstate Christianity back into the heart of government and put Britons first. Richard Tunnicliffe - Welsh Labour Welsh Labour Who is he? Richard Tunnicliffe has lived in Caerphilly with his Troedyrhiw-born wife Lynda for 26 years and they raised their three sons in the town. He has worked as an accountant and financial analyst and runs a publishing company with his wife, specialising in Welsh translations of popular children's books. He was encouraged to become more active in the local party by Hefin David, who was mentoring him to be a candidate in next year's Senedd election at the time of his death. What are his policies? Honour Hefin David's legacy by listening to constituents and solving community problems together. Champion Bevan's NHS by working proactively with local health service leaders. Earn trust by doing what I say I will do and never over-promising. Calling for the council to prioritise protecting libraries across the borough and use any future funding to do so. Lindsay Whittle - Plaid Cymru Plaid Cymru Who is he? Lindsay Whittle was born in Caerphilly town, he lives in Abertridwr, was raised on the Penyrheol council estate and attended Cwm Ifor Primary School. A councillor for Penyrheol since 1976, he was Caerphilly council leader from 1999 to 2004 and 2008 to 2011, and has been Plaid Cymru group leader on the council since 2022. From 2011 to 2016 he was a South Wales East assembly membe r (as Senedd members were previously known). What are his policies? Campaign for a fair funding settlement for Wales to help protect local services and oppose cuts, recently opposing plans to close public libraries and a leisure centre across the Caerphilly constituency. Attract quality jobs through Plaid Cymru's Making Wales Work plan, giving locally-owned small and medium-sized businesses and co-operatives in Caerphilly more help and adjusting business rates to boost town centres. Billions spent on rail projects in England, such as HS2 and the Oxford-Cambridge line, bring extra money to Scotland and Northern Ireland but not Wales. Releasing cash for Wales would help pay for local improvements. Invest in primary healthcare: Lindsay Whittle supports Plaid Cymru's plan to set up elective care hubs to get people seen faster, with a triage system to speed up referrals between GPs and hospitals.

2ae140198d13,The battle is on for the Conservatives to show they matter,,"The battle is on for the Conservatives to show they matter Laura Kuenssberg Presenter, Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg BBC ""Oh God,"" and then a pause, a sigh, and then, ""Oh God,"" again. Just as a senior Conservative was telling me the party might be able to climb out the terrible hole it's in, news popped up of another of its ranks deserting for Reform UK. Their response? Sad resignation, at yet another resignation. The individual exit of Sarah Atherton, who was briefly a defence minister when the Tories were in power, is not the point. Well over a dozen Conservative MPs or former MPs have made that same move. The question for the Conservatives perhaps this weekend is: is there a point? You don't need me to tell you that the Conservatives are unpopular - deeply so. The hangover from the last election was always going to be nasty after a proper thumping, 14 years in power, and, oh yes, those five prime ministers. But the party's standing has fallen even further since then. No discernible bounce with its new leadership under Kemi Badenoch. No profit from the misery of the government. For the group once regarded as the most successful political operation in the western world, it's dire. Technically, the Tories are still the main opposition. That brings status and meaning. It's Badenoch who gets to ask six questions of the prime minister every week. It's the Conservatives who, as is traditional, are most often called on to respond to government announcements. They still have way more MPs than the Liberal Democrats, or the SNP, and legions more than Reform or the Greens. But politically, it just doesn't feel at this moment that they are the government's hungry main challengers. That's in part because they were smashed to bits in July 2024 and it was always going to take a bit of time to come round. It's in part because the party is so far behind in the polls. It's in part because the government is very deliberately making its arguments against Reform, not their traditional Conservative rivals. As another senior party figure observes, Labour's ""framing of cutting the Tories out is the right one"". It suits Labour and the Lib Dems to treat the Tories as if they are irrelevant. And it's in part, many Conservatives argue, because Badenoch ""just hasn't generated any traction, any attention"" during her time in charge. As the Conservatives arrive in Manchester for their conference, in the very serious aftermath of the attack on Heaton Park synagogue, the primary job is to grab any attention: perhaps the Tory party is smack bang in the middle of a battle to matter at all. Reuters Prime Minister and Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer Like it or not, just as Sir Keir Starmer has discovered, grumpy parties who are not doing well point the finger at their leader. Badenoch has admirers in the Conservative Party for speaking out on particular issues like single-sex spaces, free speech, or declaring that some cultures are in her view ""less valid"" than others. Some of her colleagues applaud her blunt, tell-it-like-it-is manner. But politics is also a business of charm and empathy. A senior Tory told me after the election defeat the party had to ""go everywhere and do a mea culpa, to listen and take a kicking"". But the issue with Badenoch, they say, is ""she is grand... hasn't been anywhere and isn't listening to anyone"". Ouch. With conference about to start, it's almost a Tory tradition to fill the papers and podcasts with gripes about the party leader. She has had some more effective performances at Prime Minister's Questions. Policies are starting to emerge. Money has kept flowing to the party.  One of her backers maintains that although she is still ""finding her way"", she has some of the same ""strength and character as a young Margaret Thatcher"". Thatcher was seen as ""strange and shrill"" when she got the job, but became the party's most successful boss of modern times. But as Badenoch approaches a year in the job, it's becoming harder to find people who'll make that comparison. Whatever Badenoch's personal strengths and failures, there is a different criticism of how she has gone about the job, with a party veteran suggesting, ""there is just no pace, no nimbleness"". Maybe that should have been staring the party in the face: her original pitch for the job was ""Renewal 2030"" - a date past the next general election. During many of her interviews Badenoch has said she wants to take her time working out the right moves for the party, developing credible ideas rather than being rushed. You can expect lots of policy to be unveiled in the next few days. But politics moves incredibly fast, and another source agrees pace is a problem, saying: ""What she misunderstood is you get one chance to introduce yourself to the public – she lost the chance to generate any traction and she won't get that back."" Reform UK leader Nigel Farage was only too happy to step into that ""vacuum"", gaining strength in the polls and grabbing headlines while the Tories were busy making other plans. Getty Images Badenoch after delivering a speech at the Institute of Chartered Accountants' Hall in September Candidly, it is not unusual to hear Conservatives saying freely in private that Badenoch won't be in the job for long, she could be ""out by Christmas"", or ""might not even have to be dragged out"" if the party bombs at the polls in a set of mega elections in May. Indeed, when asked the question herself in a conference warm-up interview, she more or less said: Well, ask me then. Refreshingly honest from a leader who isn't fully in control of her own destiny? Or foolhardy when this is a moment when she ought to be mustering as much authority as she can? The conference gives a shop window to the party and its leader to show what she is made of too. As one senior MP says: ""This conference is about her, and making it clear she has a direction and a sense of where she is going, and it is hers and she is going to lead it – we have this one chance."" ""We understand the polls aren't great, a source close to the party leadership adds. ""There needs to be a bit of understanding from those who are grumbling."" But where is Badenoch trying to lead? ""If I want a can of full fat coke, then I go and buy one, if I like what Reform are saying I'm gonna vote Reform, I'm not going to vote for a party that's not quite there,"" a party insider says. Badenoch's signals on climate change, on leaving the European Convention on Human Rights, tip towards the right of the Conservative spectrum, on territory that right now, Reform have painted in bold primary colours. Bloomberg via Getty Images Reform leader Nigel Farage has grabbed headlines while the Tories were busy making other plans Badenoch is a Brexiteer, a strong advocate of free speech, and seemingly often up for a spat in the latest round of culture wars. But politics is a business - not quite like any other - but a business nonetheless. And many in the party reckon she is going after the wrong customers and ought to be trying to appeal more to soft liberals or soft Tories, rather than to those interested in Reform. ""Frankly, the gap in the market is on the centre right,"" one source says. Some of the current Tory top brass are keen to get the argument onto issues they hope might appeal more to more voters, and it's not stupid to guess it, yes, the economy. One shadow minister says: ""We have to talk about the money in your pocket and trying to articulate what all of Labour's tax rises and debt means to you in terms of the cash in your pocket and the food in your fridge."" With Reform UK in the ascendant, are they the right enemy for the Tories in any case, one source wonders? Their presence on the right means the Conservatives right now don't have the luxury of assuming they will always be the number two. The party used to be ""free to carry on in opposition in our own space – now when the party looks for who its enemy is, is it Labour, Reform or Lib Dems, or it doesn't know?"". According to one source close to the party leadership, in recent years people have struggled to know what the party stands for: ""We have flip-flopped, criss-crossed, gone from [Theresa] May to [Boris] Johnson, to [Rishi] Sunak."" There will be big announcements over the next few days setting out Badenoch's position ""and it will be the job of MPs and councils and everyone to go and sell that message"". Getty Images Badenoch giving a speech earlier this year As party members and associated hangers-on start to arrive in Manchester today, there are reasons to be gloomy for the current leadership. If you look back at the polling, Badenoch is in a worse position according to net satisfaction ratings than John Major, William Hague, Iain Duncan Smith, David Cameron, Theresa May,  Boris Johnson and Rishi Sunak. (If you're wondering, I didn't forget Liz Truss, but she wasn't around long enough to have her popularity measured after nearly a year). ""I don't remember it ever being this bad,"" says one insider, suggesting not just that Badenoch's time will be up before too long, but also that the party has been hollowed out of experience and knowledge, and many of the big-name MPs who have stuck around have, frankly, rather checked out. But one of Badenoch's backers suggests it's the party, not the leadership, that ought to have a word with itself. They told me their colleagues have got a ""messiah complex - ever since Margaret they think there is a leader out there who will lead them to the promised land"". In other words, get your heads down, get your work done, and stop thinking it's all about the person at the top. ""We need to understand real history, not folk history,"" they say, suggesting a new leader would not and could not solve the party's problems on their own. Do it again, and a frontbencher suggests ""people will think, 'Oh God, they haven't changed!'"" But the overall picture for the Tories' top team is as foul as the weather in Manchester which awaits them. ""They're not relevant, they don't matter - that is the big thing the current team have not understood,"" one Tory source worries. ""If it's not resolved soon it's easy to see  how we might be in third or even fourth place"" when it gets to the next election, they add. Not for the first time, you don't need me to remind you - but I will - that politics in the 2020s is a very unpredictable era. There are known unknowns. Might Badenoch pull off a blinding speech this week? Will Labour be patient with Sir Keir until the general election? Will Reform hold together? Will the economy improve? And unknown unknowns that we can't list right now. And anyone who claims to know what's next may as well be trying to sell ice to an Eskimo. The Conservative party has been pronounced more or less gone before. There was even a book published titled ""The Strange Death of Tory England"". Five years later, David Cameron strolled into No 10. But the party is in trouble. Conferences are always an opportunity for political parties, but also a risk. The pressure is on the Tories to show they matter in the next few days, or more on their own side may wonder what they're for.

James Landale Diplomatic correspondent Getty Images As prime minister of the UK for more than 10 years, Sir Tony Blair was a master of political compromise. He was seen as a deft negotiator of the centre ground, triangulating his way out of the straitjacket of traditional left-right politics. But if there were peace in Gaza and he were summoned to help govern what was left, would even Teflon Tony – as he was once known – have the political wiles to keep all sides happy and the guns silent? His putative role is still not clear. Donald Trump's 20-point peace plan envisages an international transitional body that would oversee the governance of post-war Gaza. The US president would chair this so-called ""Board of Peace"" and Sir Tony, aged 72, would be a member. He's a ""good man, very good man"", Trump told reporters. Sir Tony's presence on this hypothetical body would come as no surprise. The former prime minister has been closely involved in drawing up Gaza peace proposals for months. He has been working with Jared Kushner, Trump's son-in-law, and Ron Dermer, a key adviser to Israel's prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu. In August, Sir Tony attended a high-level meeting with Trump at the White House to discuss a post-war strategy for the Strip. A month earlier he also held talks with Steve Witkoff, the president's chief envoy, at the White House. In a statement, Sir Tony unsurprisingly lavished praise on the Trump plan, describing it as ""bold and intelligent"" and ""the best chance of ending two years of war, misery and suffering"". He said the proposals created the possibility not only ""of Israelis and Palestinians finding a path to peace"" but also ""a broader regional and global alliance to counter the forces of extremism and promote peace and prosperity between nations"". And that is the key point: this is what Sir Tony has been pushing for decades in different roles. As prime minister from 1997, he supported the Clinton administration's efforts to find peace in the region. On the very day he left office in June 2007, he was appointed special envoy for a so-called Quartet - representing the US, Russia, the EU and UN – designed to coordinate peace efforts, a role he held until 2015. His supporters insist his remit at the Quartet was economic development and he was excluded from the political process. Since then his business and other interests – including his Tony Blair Institute for Global Change - have kept him firmly plugged into the region. Diplomats say this is what makes Sir Tony unique; he is trusted by the Trump administration, he has an unparalleled network in the Middle East, and he has long experience of dealing with both Israeli and Palestinian leaderships. Nick Hopton, director general of the Middle East Association, said the former UK PM was the only western leader one could imagine taking the role. ""He's got the credibility and experience having been embroiled in the Middle East for 24 years,"" he said. ""But it will work only if he is able to have the confidence of Donald Trump and also if he is not seen as being manipulated by Benjamin Netanyahu. He also needs to demonstrate he has the confidence of the Palestinian Authority leadership."" But – and it is a big but – Sir Tony would come to the role with much baggage. To some he is a divisive figure, to others worse. Role in Iraq invasion 'not forgotten' His role in joining the 2003 invasion of Iraq - based on incorrect reports about the country's weapons of mass destruction – still tarnishes his reputation in the region and has led some to accuse him of war crimes. Francesca Albanese, UN special rapporteur on rights in the occupied Palestinian territories, was blunt. ""Tony Blair? Hell no. Hands off Palestine,"" she posted on social media. ""Shall we meet in The Hague perhaps?"", a reference to the location of the International Criminal Court. Sir Simon Fraser, former head of the UK Foreign Office, said Sir Tony had shown genuine interest in the Palestinian issue and was trusted in Washington, Israel and the Gulf. ""But the Arab street has not forgotten Iraq,"" he said. ""The future oversight of Gaza needs a broader base and cannot look like an American/British enterprise."" Hamas, for one, did not seem keen. Husam Badran, a member of the group's political bureau, said this week Sir Tony should be on trial for the US invasion of Iraq, not administering Gaza. ""Any plan linked to Blair is an ill omen,"" he said. Some Palestinians and others also see Sir Tony as historically always being too close to Israeli and US positions. Nomi Bar-Yaacov, a former international peace negotiator, said: ""I don't think the Palestinians trust him at all. I think they view him as a colossal failure during the time that he was the Quartet envoy."" Even UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer, who used his Labour conference speech on Tuesday to praise the Trump peace plan, chose to make no mention of the key role his predecessor might play. As Middle East peace envoy for eight long years, Sir Tony was supposed to help build up the Palestinian Authority so that one day it would be in a fit state to run a Palestinian state. But few would argue that this is where the PA is today. Palestinians also argue he did not do enough to push back against illegal settlements and settler violence. Some have claimed he should have made a stronger case for Palestinian statehood, focusing instead on economic development. Getty Images As former Quartet special envoy Tony Blair met Benjamin Netanyahu in 2014 The interesting question is why Sir Tony still feels the need to be involved in trying to find an end to the fighting in the Middle East. He has long seen himself as a peace-maker, after his success negotiating the Good Friday Agreement that helped reduce conflict in Northern Ireland. But as a political correspondent throughout the 1990s and 2000s, and thus a close observer of the Blair years of power, I was always struck by his dogged refusal to accept that he might have failed to persuade someone of his point of view. It niggled at him. To that extent, the Middle East may be seen by Sir Tony as unfinished business. Health Secretary Wes Streeting told PA Media Sir Tony's role would ""raise eyebrows"" because of the Iraq war and said he had an ""incredible legacy"" in Northern Ireland of building peace that lasted. ""If he can bring that skill set to bear in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, with the support of Israelis, Palestinians and other regional powers, then so much the better,"" Mr Streeting said. In truth, the role of Blair is a second order issue. He will have a job to do only if this peace plan succeeds and survives, and there is no guarantee of that. Far more important are the differences between both sides and details that are as yet unresolved by the framework outlined by the White House. Sanam Vakil, Middle East programme director at the Chatham House think tank, said: ""The focus on Tony Blair and his legacy of western intervention in Iraq masks the real challenges of this peace framework that lacks details, timelines and deliverables - and does not yet have Palestinian or Israeli buy-in, let alone leadership. ""Without significant work to move beyond 20 points on a piece of paper, this plan will be another version of cosmetic diplomacy that embeds structural injustice and deprives Palestinians of agency and sovereignty."" So maybe what really matters is not perhaps the psychodrama of Sir Tony Blair and the controversial opinions people hold about him. A more relevant question may be more what role any transitional authority in Gaza might play and whether Sir Tony has the right skills and experience to play a significant role. If his job would be to coordinate with Gulf leaders and the White House, that is one thing. But if he were being asked effectively to govern Gaza, overseeing the reconstruction, the security and economic development of the Strip, that is quite another. ""Viceroy Blair?"" one diplomat texted me. ""That will never wash.""",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c89d5938w3ko,Politics,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/ebc5/live/f21cee50-9e2b-11f0-ba41-9d184b600492.jpg,2025-09-30T19:31:18.674000+00:00,0664df86f879ca2d24ecbbd482679548e1a50884
5fb84056c04c,Why Starmer wants to keep talking about Farage,,"Why Starmer wants to keep talking about Farage Matt Chorley Presenter, BBC Radio 5 Live Getty Images ""Know yourself and know your enemy,"" wrote Sun Tzu, the Chinese military adviser from the 6th century BC. ""In a hundred battles, you will never be defeated."" Sir Keir Starmer might not quite have 100 battles, but he's got a fair few on his hands: with his party, with the bond markets, with the mayor of Greater Manchester. And yet the prime minister, who still helms an enormous Commons majority, has a resolute focus on who the singular enemy is. And it's a party with five MPs: Reform UK. Time and again, Sir Keir has chosen during Labour's conference week to focus on Nigel Farage, having written off the Conservatives as ""dead"" and barely mentioning the Lib Dems, Greens or other parties eating into Labour support from the left. 'Different fight' But in the lanyard-laden fringes and bars in Liverpool, there is a live conversation about the wisdom of this strategy. Does naming your enemy so publicly help bring focus to the government's operation and attack? Or does it risk elevating Reform UK, a new party with no record in government, to an elite status which only serves to bolster rather than damage them? Reform UK love it. Whenever the prime minister goes out of his way to mock or ridicule them during PMQs, Farage and his MPs including Richard Tice and Lee Anderson slap their thighs in pantomime laughter, believing they are being paid a high compliment. At the weekend, Sir Keir said the fight with Reform is different. ""Most elections have always been Labour or Conservative,"" he said. ""This is a different election that we are facing.  We have not had a proposition like Reform in this country ever before. This is a different fight. It is a fight about who we are as a country, it goes to the soul of our future."" Some in Liverpool this week have likened this to Joe Biden's repeated refrain against Donald Trump in 2020 that they were locked in a ""battle for the soul of the nation"". However, some within Labour are unsure if the strategy of attacking Farage is the right approach. One backbench MP from the North East told me that those in Downing Street advising the PM ""don't get it"" - and don't represent ""white, working class council estates"" with voters that worry about immigration. ""They tend to be the frothy coffee drinking liberal lefties. They are speaking to the same people,"" they added. Others suggest that keeping Kemi Badenoch's Conservative party alive, or at least their share of the vote up, is needed to split the vote on the right. One senior minister said: ""The Tories being dead doesn't help us, it just pushes people to Reform. It's a bit like how at the last general election we needed the Lib Dems to do well, as they took seats off the Tories rather than us. ""But this is worse, because both Tory and Labour are voters shifting to Reform. In places from Barnsley to Bexley, we need the right vote to split, and then we need to squeeze Lib Dems and the Greens to come down the middle."" John Denham, a minister under Tony Blair and Gordon Brown in the last Labour government, agrees. ""It makes no sense to me to elevate Reform to that position, even if you think the Tories are dead,"" he told me on BBC Radio 5 Live. ""We have four years left of this government. The idea that the only thing we think we can offer in four years time is 'well, at least we're not Reform'... surely to God we can do something with the huge majority we've got and the time we've got to tell a convincing story that marginalizes Reform."" He suggested that there were a ""really very small"" group of people who might switch between Reform and Labour. The latest YouGov poll suggests just over half of Labour's 2024 voters are sticking with them. Some 12% have switched to Reform, and 4% to the Conservatives, while another 13% have gone to the Lib Dems, 12% to the Greens, and others have gone to the SNP and Plaid Cymru, suggesting losses to the left are far greater than to the right. 'We love it' However, Tom Lubbock, from pollsters JL Partners, thinks focussing on Reform UK is ""extremely smart politics"". ""If you look at Labour voters who are undecided at the moment, if you force that choice and say it's a choice between Keir Starmer and Nigel Farage, a lot of them who are undecided will come back into the Labour boat. ""And, you know, there's a lot of time to go before that next election, but it's actually very smart at the moment to make that the choice."" Previous party leaders and governments have faced this choice about how to deal with insurgent parties under Farage. Ed Davey, the Lib Dem leader, made around 30 references to Farage in his conference speech last week. Simon Lewis, a former director of communications for Gordon Brown, said: ""The risk is that you are seen to be taking your opponent too seriously. ""Multiple references to his name probably gets people thinking, goodness, these guys are really scared about Reform. And I think you do have to be very careful."" Number 10 insiders defend the strategy, and insist the PM is adamant that the country is at a crossroads, and he thinks it is his responsibility to stand up to Farage. So what do Reform make of party leaders falling over themselves to namecheck them and their leader? ""It made us laugh,"" said Gawain Towler, a former press adviser to Farage. ""We love it. We absolutely love it! It's so preposterous.""

3d99c7fb1bf0,Reeves pre-emptively justifies tax rises,,"In Liverpool Rachel Reeves seemed to be floating a pre-emptive argument ahead of possible tax rises in her November Budget. The key line in the chancellor's speech in relation to the Budget was her linking of tough decisions ""in coming months"" to global headwinds and a critical reassessment of the long-term productivity performance of the UK economy, about to be delivered by the Office for Budget Responsibility. ""We will face further tests, with choices to come, made all the harder by harsh global headwinds and long-term damage to the economy, which is becoming ever clearer,"" she said. This prepares the government's argument if there does need to be further tax rises, even significant ones at the Budget. Firstly, they will blame the broad global economic backdrop, of trade wars, actual wars and rising government interest rates. ""The world has changed,"" the chancellor told the Today programme. Secondly, the OBR's reassessment of the UK's long-term economic trends is revealing ""ever clearer"" evidence of ""long-term damage"" which she will blame on the record of her predecessors. The other notable call was for ""responsible management of public finances"" against opposition voices and those in her own party. Other than that, this was relatively light on policies. The policies that most of the country are the most interested in - what is in the Budget - have not been nailed down, and depend on the ping pong about to start with the OBR over its forecasting process. It is on that, where we did get new news today. The chancellor confirmed publicly that she agreed with the International Monetary Fund about changing the fiscal dance that has created non-stop speculation about tax changes. The OBR forecast by law has to happen twice a year, but that could now only happen in full once a year. There are various options. This is a tacit admission that after whatever emerges from the Budget, everyone would benefit from a period of stability, and that has not been the case over the past year. Elsewhere she repeated the idea that the election promises not to increase the main tax rates were still in place. When asked if VAT could rise, she said: ""The manifesto commitments stand."" This appears to connect the commitments to a state of the world that could change. As the Chief Secretary to the PM Darren Jones said: ""The manifesto commitments stand today."" Those manifesto commitments are clearly under pressure, if the OBR's calculations go against the Treasury. Her interpretation of how flexible they are was revealing. She wants to protect pay packets and ""not put up the prices in shops"". That would appear to rule out a straightforward rise in the rate of VAT, which would directly raise bills. There are many other options, depending on the size of the gap - to be revealed to her by the OBR this week - from scrapping some tax breaks and allowances, especially on housing and pensions, to extending the freeze on tax thresholds. The changes made by the OBR to the UK's underlying rate of growth could add considerably to the gap in the public finances Reeves has to bridge in the Budget. The draft details will be presented to her on Friday. It is then and only then that the real work of translating a series of tax proposals into a Budget starts in earnest. The government will also seek to persuade the OBR that its policy moves, from infrastructure plans, to closer ties with Europe, can help long-term growth. Today was about leaving some options open, at a tricky time. The extent of tax rises, and who gets hit, is still very much up for grabs.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cj6x07j9e43o,Politics,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/b00d/live/35d04c80-9dcf-11f0-9f23-2534d63ace40.jpg,2025-09-29T16:36:04.080000+00:00,49bd84822a5e22116dd9d6bf818121ae5ed450d3
60200561be67,Can Labour reverse 'desperate loss of faith' from business?,,"Can Labour reverse 'desperate loss of faith' from business? Simon Jack Business editor WPA Pool/Getty Images One of the key audiences that the prime minister and the chancellor will have to convince at this year's Labour conference are the business leaders they targeted with a charm offensive before the election last July. The party trumpeted itself as ""the natural party of business"" and Rachel Reeves told anyone and everyone that this would be ""the most pro-business government this country has ever seen"". Labour had some big business beasts backing them. Billionaire mobile phone tycoon John Caudwell - a long-time Conservative supporter - switched his backing to Labour . Some 120 business leaders signed a letter which read: ""We, as leaders and investors in British business, believe that it is time for a change. For too long now, our economy has been beset by instability, stagnation, and a lack of long-term focus. ""Labour has shown it has changed and wants to work with business to achieve the UK's full economic potential."" But post-election, the party sent a different message - warning of tough choices and hard times ahead, and delivered a Budget to prove it. That Budget, says John Caudwell, with its £25bn rise in employers' National Insurance, undid a lot of the goodwill the chancellor had garnered. ""I think there was a desperate loss of faith from the business community in general from the last Budget,"" he says. ""I think people were shocked at the level of negative components for businesses."" On top of that NI rise, the National Living Wage was hiked by an inflation-busting 6.7%, with a rise of 16% for 18 to 20-year-olds. Mr Caudwell says he understands that Labour needed to raise money to shore up the public finances but felt it hit some sectors unduly hard. ""Even if you say they needed to be done, certain aspects were very unfair. So if you look at the increase in employers' NI, that really badly hit those businesses that employ tens of thousands of people on low wages, because they got hit by minimum wage and they got hit by the NI."" PA John Caudwell says businesses were shocked at ""the level of negative components"" they faced after the last Budget Other small business owners have also told the BBC they have lost confidence. Rachel Carrell is the boss of childcare firm Koru Kids and signed that letter in 2024. She says she hopes the government can restore business confidence over the rest of the parliament. ""I wouldn't sign that letter today but they've got three or four years to turn this around. That's a really long time."" She believes there's an opportunity to fix things in the upcoming Budget, but says ""they need to move quickly"". While anecdotal evidence of crumbling business confidence is not hard to find, official measures show a mixed picture. The Institute of Directors' confidence measure shows a steep fall after the last election, which compilers put down to immediate warnings issued by the government once in power that tough times and tough choices lay ahead. That was duly delivered on by the Budget and has hovered near those lows ever since. However, the government's favourite index to quote is the Lloyds Bank confidence survey, which shows confidence on the future is much more robust. Other measures, including the ICAEW and the S&P PMI measures, tend to support a more gloomy outlook. That in turn is supported by the number of businesses looking to recruit. Job vacancies have been on a downward trend since the Covid pandemic and there are 150,000 fewer staff on payrolls now than there were before the Budget bombshell, with a large part of those jobs going in hospitality. However, there is widespread hope among smaller businesses that the long-promised overhaul of business rates will come soon and in their favour. The government points understandably to the enormous amounts of money pledged recently when tech royalty from Apple, Nvidia, Microsoft and others met real royalty at US President Donald Trump's recent state visit. John Caudwell welcomed it too. ""I hear a lot of negativity about government - we hear about rich people leaving and they are useful to the UK economy, but they're not as useful as the £150bn of inward investment that we've got coming into the country to create high-paid jobs in high-technological businesses. So we have to get a balanced view on that."" Mark Brearley runs a trolley and tray manufacturing and export business in Peckham, south London. He is less impressed with the razzamatazz surrounding the tech billionaires and their largesse. ""I'm sure it's very important to get these racy high-growth sectors to invest here. But what about the less exciting bits of the economy - the ones who are always here? We feel forgotten. ""I was hopeful that a new government would give us some help but all my costs have gone up - my business rates have doubled. I'm more cautious about investing in a new machine, a new product, hiring a new person."" The new Employment Rights Bill , which confers greater rights and protections on employees from day one, is also adding to employers' reluctance to take on new staff. Mark Brearley says small businesses like his feel forgotten The government has made much of its plans to sweep away impediments to economic growth and has seen that acknowledged by some of the biggest investors in UK infrastructure. Just months after Labour entered Downing Street, Scottish Power announced a £24bn UK investment. Keith Anderson, chief executive of Scottish Power, says: ""The government has taken on the planning bogeyman to unlock growth and get us building. That's why the UK is now Iberdrola's biggest investment destination globally."" Rain Newton-Smith, director general of the employers group the CBI, also gives the government high marks on the international stage. ""I think this government have navigated really difficult geopolitics. We've got a better deal with the US than others, we're forging a closer relationship with Europe and they got the deal with India. ""They've got a lot of work done internationally, and that does count. But they've really got to dial up delivery, and make sure that they they learn from the mistakes of last autumn."" Business confidence is a vital but fragile thing. It's a key ingredient for any government hoping that economic growth will pay for its other spending commitments - on heath, defence and welfare. Labour has a job on its hands at conference, and at the Budget, to restore the animal spirits of UK business.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn0xyxnyz48o,Politics,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/7aa5/live/803f8e10-9af1-11f0-89b4-1b2d09c610c7.jpg,2025-09-29T06:29:26.809000+00:00,4012358ec77c35c2ca0ec06f7ff0a9cbde553a3f
f0865c91c474,How much trouble is Labour in - and is the PM the right man for the job?,,"How much trouble is Labour in - and is the PM the right man for the job? Laura Kuenssberg Presenter, Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg BBC Sir Keir Starmer achieved what many sage minds in Westminster believed was impossible. Labour smashed itself to bits in 2019. But Sir Keir put the party back together and swept back to power with an epic majority five years later. Yet, turn on the radio or glance at the headlines and Labour appears to be flirting with the unthinkable – giving him his P45. In the last few days I've spoken to 30 people across government and the party -  ministers, MPs, advisers - to try to work out, as the prime minister makes his way to Labour's annual party conference in Liverpool, how much trouble is he really in? ""How many more data points do you need to see that he is just not very good at being prime minister?"" Unforgiving as that sounds, the Whitehall figure who posed that question is far from the only person who has seen Starmer's government up close to conclude that fundamentally, the prime minister is just not suited to many aspects of the job. For months polling has suggested the public feels the same. Sir Keir is an intelligent, incredibly diligent, serious-minded politician who has achieved extraordinary things. But time and again the same problems are raised, summed up brutally by another senior figure: ""His judgement on people has proven to be flawed, see endless staffing resets."" ""His judgement on policy is flawed, hence U-turns, and he can't communicate, and has been unpopular in the public's eyes for a long time."" Others point to a slow pace of decision making in Downing Street, suggesting the prime minister thinks ""too like a chairman, not a chief executive,"" says another insider. And ""he only gets to the right answer having exhausted all the other options,"" rather than moving fast using a gut political instinct. Another senior party figure says: ""He doesn't think like a leader."" Getty Images Everyone in the Labour party is fed up with months of shocking polls. But others are fed up of colleagues complaining about the boss, whether the small number who do so in public, or the much higher number who do so in private. ""It's like being England manager,"" one cabinet minister jokes. ""Everyone thinks they can do a better job."" You can hear the frustration in others' voices, highlighting the ""outstanding job"" Starmer has done on the world stage – wrangling President Donald Trump, or leading support for Ukraine. ""He hasn't put a foot wrong,"" when it comes to foreign policy, says a cabinet minister. Another praises the ""sensible changes"" the prime minister has just made to Downing Street, saying ""people now are now in jobs that will suit their abilities better"" after the reshuffle, and promising the public will soon see the benefit. There can be no hiding from a very messy few weeks, with the forced exits of Angela Rayner and Lord Mandelson , and the circus around the Mayor of Greater Manchester Andy Burnham's not very hidden ambition. But there are other believers in what they see as Starmer's steady and relentless leadership, as one party source jokes: ""There were a couple of weeks where we couldn't get of bed without accidentally tearing our own arms off."" They predict ""that could all go away if we have a decent couple of months"". Perhaps. What even some of the prime minister's staunchest allies believe is that, he must explain more clearly, and vigorously, to the party - and to all of us - what the government is actually doing and why. Getty Images Sir Keir himself admitted as much in the summer, saying: ""We haven't always told our story as well as we should."" So in the next few days, and live on the programme tomorrow, expect the prime minister to try hard to make a clearer pitch to the country. After a horrible few weeks, aides say the prime minister is in a ""better place, clearer about the argument he wants to make"". Announcements like the Hillsborough Law, the returns deal with France, and yesterday's confirmation that ministers will go ahead with digital ID cards will convey, No 10 hopes, a sense of momentum. And you can expect him to build on the argument he's been making about patriotism in politics, trying to reclaim some of the territory Reform UK have been trying to grab. There are two problems though. Firstly, even Starmer's biggest fans in government know fluid communication is not his strong point. He doesn't see the camera, or the TV sofa as his friend. A strong defender of Starmer tells me: ""I wish he was better at telling a story, people don't understand how deeply he feels it and how passionate he is, but he personally isn't good at it."" Secondly, and according to one senior MP this is the bigger issue: ""We're just not clear about what we are doing or who we are for."" Another staffer tells me: ""There is no fire, no passion, no vision – we are timid and flat-footed."" Even if the prime minister suddenly developed the silky charm and persuasiveness of George Clooney, or the bombastic nature of Piers Morgan, the question becomes, what is the story he wants to tell? Multiple exits from the No 10 communications team tell you that working this out is not an easy task. Getty Images One source says: ""Until we know the story we are trying to tell we will get buffeted around."" Is reforming schools, hospitals or welfare at the top of the list?  Building houses or becoming a green ""superpower""? Or being at the forefront of technology, or protecting our borders, or growing the economy? Or is it now this priority of ""patriotic renewal""? If you have that many priorities, how can the public understand what you care about most? To govern is to choose after all, if you're not doing much choosing, are you doing much governing? One source suggested frankly, even for those who work closely alongside him, it's often hard to work out what the prime minister thinks, telling me: ""He often appears unknowable."" ""He compartmentalises his life - personal, professional, and political - in a way that works for him, but leaves colleagues unsure of his true views."" In a sense it seems extraordinary that the leader of a political party can leave colleagues unsure of their views, after 14 months in office, and four years as leader in opposition. But his early years in charge were dominated by internal fights for control of the party, and over antisemitism, not over ideas. One source recalls: ""We had lots of fights to win in opposition, but they were never, ever about what the parties' priorities should be."" Getty Images The prime minister has a huge chance in the next few days to spell out to his party, and to the public, exactly where he stands, and exactly what he believes in specific terms. After a horrible summer, and a very tricky year, it is desperately needed if the party is to get back on track. ""There is a way through this, but he has to assert himself,"" says one cabinet minister, desperate for the prime minister to remind his party and the country why they elected him in the first place. Ministers and Downing Street are frustrated by chatter about Starmer's leadership, especially the behaviour of Andy Burnahm in recent days. ""Everyone needs to just shut up and get on with their own jobs,"" one government source says. Another says: ""the Burnham stuff is just ridiculous."" ""He doesn't have a seat in Parliament, wouldn't necessarily find or win one,"" and one minister snipes, ""any chance to have a dig – Burnham will never miss an opportunity"". They predict confidently, the party ""doesn't want regicide or disruption, they just want us to do well"". But leadership chatter is a symbol that all is not well. And that sense of assurance is far from universal. One senior figure outside government warns me, ""they don't realise they are in serious, serious trouble – this is literally a head-in-hands-moment"". There are real discussions in different pockets of the Labour movement about whether Starmer should still lead the party. And the sweaty bars and fringe meetings of the party conference provide the perfect backdrop for those out to make trouble. Yet it's clear from multiple conversations that it's not only mischief makers who are pondering what to do. ""Frustration is wide and deep,"" says a senior MP. One insider who has been part of conversations about the chances of changing the leader says, ""it's not flighty people, not just newbies without a clue, they're not idiots"". Even on the government payroll one minister worries, ""the country is desperate for a disrupter, and it's just not who he is,"" questioning whether Starmer can be the right man for this political moment. Here's the fundamental question, asked by many, expressed by one senior figure: ""Do we think Keir can improve? People don't think he can, although they wish he would. But there is a sinking feeling."" Sign up for the Off Air with Laura K newsletter to get Laura Kuenssberg's expert insight and insider stories every week, emailed directly to you. Some MPs are even pointing to the example of the Democrats' failure to tell former President Joe Biden to go , which left the party no time to build up another candidate. The source continues we ""dread and fear being the people who didn't do what was necessary to stop the country electing Farage"". Others would baulk at that comparison. The prime minister has only had just over a year in charge. The problems Labour inherited on taking office were profound. Centre left political parties in many countries are grappling with how to deal with demographics, immigration, an era where public money is very tight. There are more than three years until the next general election. There is time to start wrestling with all of that. The electorate has shown politicians they can move in droves, and fast. So many ministers plead for patience. One wishes his colleagues would not just ""get a grip"", but remember they were all elected on a promise to stop political chaos. ""Anyone who thinks the challenging world is rectified by a change in leader, I don't understand the rationale. When we look at how unstable things are, and talk about leadership, how would the bond markets respond, when our primary responsibility is stabilising the economy?"" Another source dismisses those predicting doom in the party, ""nothing is irrevocable, and nothing is inevitable"". Perhaps the rebooted No 10 will start getting better results. Perhaps, and No 10 fervently hopes, Sir Keir will wow the crowds at conference, and display why he earned the job to start with, and won the election in the first place. The prime minister's position is also, frankly,  protected by the fact there is no consensus about who could do a better job than him. Even if Labour were to conclude universally, which it is far from doing, that Starmer's leadership is somehow beyond repair, that reality is a smack in the face for those who'd seek a change. As one Whitehall figure suggests: ""problem one, is he good at being PM? No. But next problem, do you have an upgrade? Hmm..."" Labour's answer to that question right now, notwithstanding Andy Burnham's antics, is, ""well, we're not sure"". AFP via Getty Images A lack of clarity over who would be next, and fresh memories of the political shambles of the Conservatives' change of leader, both put the brakes on anyone seeking to make a change any time soon. As ever in politics two things that might appear to be contradictory are in fact, both true. Is it mad on paper for Labour to be even vaguely contemplating changing their leader so soon, without an obvious strong successor, when they ran on a promise of no drama? For many, yes, it's crackers. But is the discussion about whether the PM can carry on like this just idle chit-chat? Not at all. One senior figure sums up the situation with no pleasure – discussion about changing the Labour leader ""is both lunatic, and real"". The leadership's hope is that a strong conference without too many noises off, and an effective speech from the platform by the prime minister himself might calm everything down. A political get together, a party conference for the politicians, members, and associated hangers-on, would never transform a prime minister's fortunes with the public overnight. But it can make a big difference to how a party feels about itself. For Starmer to have a chance of restoring his position with the public he must first, once again, persuade his party that he is the man for the job. But without restoring his party's faith in him, convincing Labour of his merits, his own position could well be at risk. One insider who knows the prime minister well suggested: ""He is not a natural explainer… he states positions but doesn't repeatedly argue for them. ""This has led to an aversion to debate, treating persuasion as weakness."" Yet politics is, above all else,  the art of persuasion. That is perhaps the dilemma for Labour. That is the problem for him.

0f4766085b7c,What lessons can Starmer learn from world leaders on fighting Reform?,,"What lessons can Starmer learn from world leaders on fighting Reform? Iain Watson Political correspondent BBC ""The country is at a crossroads,"" Sir Keir Starmer is expected to declare in a speech just ahead of the annual Labour conference, which kicks off this weekend. The prime minister will suggest there are two paths to choose: one is the way of ""division and decline"" with Reform UK, or Labour's route – unity and progress. For some in Labour's ranks, the leadership's response, so far, to the rise of Reform has gone down like a lead balloon. Not nimble enough, not impassioned, is the message. With Labour lagging in the polls, expect to hear the anti-Reform rhetoric ramped up - but exactly how to burst the populist bubble has proved challenging. The response to Reform leader Nigel Farage's proposal this week to end existing migrants' Indefinite Leave to Remain suggested that Labour hadn't quite settled on the most effective line of attack. Chancellor Rachel Reeves questioned Reform's alleged cost-savings and denounced the policy as a gimmick; Labour Party chair Anna Turley highlighted unanswered questions but also raised the prospect of families being broken up; the MP Sarah Owen also mentioned family break-up but added that this was ""morally abhorrent"". None of these responses were mutually exclusive but they differed in tone, and perhaps point to a tension between denouncing Reform as not serious - or as all too serious. Just a year ago, the Conservatives were Labour's principal opponents. The government now has to grapple with an insurgent party with no track record in office and which is eroding Labour's, not just the Conservatives', vote. And it's not a problem that's unique to the UK. Reuters Sir Keir Starmer will be eyeing the lessons from Australia, after Prime Minister Anthony Albanese won a second term There is concern amongst centre-left parties internationally that a rejuvenated right is doing well at the ballot box and seemingly winning the battle of ideas. So how do they fight back? The think-tank, the IPPR; the Center for American Progress and the pro-leadership Labour Together organisation have brought together an array of progressive leaders to share their electoral lessons at a major conference in London on Friday. Their big tent encompasses not just international socialist and social democratic parties but also Greens, Liberals - and even some former Conservatives. Labour strategists are looking enviously at their Australian counterparts who won a second term in May. Anthony Albanese's government tackled the immigration issue - in which they had felt vulnerable - soon after taking power and tightened rules on student and temporary visas. They were able to demonstrate a steady reduction in net migration before polling day and made the political case for continuing to bring in skilled labour - defeating an opponent who called for bigger reductions. But there won't be a single template for Labour to follow. The Spanish Socialist PM Pedro Sanchez's approach is to not to bang on about immigration but when necessary to defend it as a contributor to a growing economy, while the Danish Social Democrat PM Mette Federikson has been taking a hard line on asylum. There is nonetheless a shared recognition that a defence of the status quo is no longer sustainable. The IPPR's Harry Quilter-Pinner says it would be a mistake to follow ""the playbook of the right"". He tells me: ""The populist right's story is one of extraction – of just taking. Progressives should reject this - it stokes divisions."" He suggests when it comes to economic migration there needs to be an assessment of whether - and how quickly -  a UK citizen could be trained to do a job. He believes more of a fuss should be made of becoming British citizen, and there needs to be an expectation of what new citizens would contribute. Claire Ainsley, who was Sir Keir Starmer's policy chief when he was in opposition, is now overseeing a project on centre-left renewal at the Progressive Policy Institute, and her advice is to grow the ""seeds of doubt"" about Reform in the electorate's minds in the three years between now and the election. She believes that while people are happy to cast a protest vote, they currently question whether Reform are really a government in waiting - so challenging them on whether their policies hold together, or whether their numbers add up, is a way of undermining their support. But it does also mean doing more to tackle the core issue. She says the party leadership realised ""the previous set of answers on immigration were not going to wash with the British public that want to see action"", and says she was encouraged by Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood's promise that ""nothing is off the table"" in tackling illegal migration. But tackling Reform isn't just about immigration. Ms Ainsley says it's about people feeling worse off and not feeling they have got a fair deal on the economy,  and a sense that other people are getting treated better than them. The current buzzword around government is ""contribution"" - convincing people that they will be beneficiaries and not just contributors to a welfare state. This is likely to be developed further in the main Labour conference speeches in Liverpool next week. Previewing that, Labour Together published a report this week. In it, chief policy officer Morgan Wild argues that over the past decades, the link between what people put in and what they get out has all but disappeared. He says: ""It is hard to explain to people why their council tax is going up while their waste service is being cut. It is hard to explain to the public why asylum seekers are being placed in hotels for years on end at the taxpayers' expense....the best way to restore trust is through the contributory principle. If you pay in, you should be able to see what you get out."" Labour MP Clive Lewis, on the party's left, doesn't underestimate the scale of the challenge. One of his school friends took part in the recent Unite the Kingdom march in central London . Lewis hadn't thought he'd be part of it – he had black family members and is, says Lewis, ""a great guy"" - but his friend had texted to say he felt he was being listened to. Lewis says he has seen a ""vehemence and anger"" amongst a section of the electorate who feel let down - and for Keir Starmer to be believed when he calls out Farage, he needs to be trusted. He says he believes seeing off Farage is a much bigger task than making a speech, and the prime minister has to do nothing less than change the political culture in the government and in the country. Adam Langleben of the Progressive Britain think tank also believes progressive parties need to be more ""humble"" – whether in victory or defeat. ""We have an avoidable habit of not listening enough to the electorate,"" he says. Tackling a pessimistic public mood also requires more than policies. The prime minister is a political leader who appears to know the value of symbols. Soon after winning his party's leadership in 2020, he branded Labour literature with the union flag, which was also never far from the backdrop of his TV news clips. Initially it was to help define him against his predecessor, Jeremy Corbyn. The message was: Sir Keir would be unambiguously pro-Nato, pro nuclear deterrent, pro strong defence - proud of the flag. Safe to vote for. But those who converged in central London on the Unite the Kingdom march to hear Tommy Robinson weren't exactly waving their flags to symbolise support for Labour. It has again become a contested symbol. The prime minister is expected to say he wants to reclaim the flag. It's a problem that previous Labour leaders have grappled with - and the current one can perhaps learn from. When Neil Kinnock was the Labour opposition leader in the 1980s, he did not want to cede the mantle of patriotism to the Conservatives, so he sought to define patriotism in line with his own beliefs, and he placed the union jack (and the flags of the UK's constituent nations) on party literature to reclaim it, he said, from the far-right party, the BNP. In the 2000s, the governments of Tony Blair and Gordon Brown sought to claim 'Britishness' for themselves. But Keir Starmer faces a tougher political landscape now. According to recent polling from pollster Lord Ashcroft , the public can't agree on why union and English flags have been appearing on lampposts, and whether or not this is a good thing. Labour, Lib Dem and Green voters tend to think they signal hostility to immigrants; while right of centre voters believe they are signs of frustration with immigration. Overall, 39% of respondents supported the appearance of the flags while 28% disapproved - but about a quarter of voters surveyed had mixed feelings. Despite obvious divisions, Adam Langleben believes it is possible to create a ""progressive patriotism"", taking a leaf from the maiden speech of the murdered MP Jo Cox , which celebrated diversity but recognised that ""we have far more in common than that which divides us"". Reform UK have been clear what they are against. But some of the prime minister's own MPs say he can only really be successful in taking on Reform if he is clearer about what he is for.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3w5703yn77o,Politics,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/5e19/live/7804c0a0-99f5-11f0-928c-71dbb8619e94.jpg,2025-09-25T11:25:24+00:00,d56df95abf9dbe270b0bdcf5259c7a69c39acb5d

The department said ""officials are working at pace with [the minister] to determine how we will move forward with a War Memorial"". The trust took this as welcome confirmation that the new Labour government did intend to honour the previous government's commitment to make a grant available to help fund a Muslim war memorial, even if it was not confirmation the memorial would definitely go ahead. Over the following months Sir William continued to press for a decision and whether the Â£1m was still available. In November 2024, the department said that it remained ""committed to providing funding of up to Â£1m"", and officials were working on taking the matter forward. The following month, an exercise to gather information about suppliers was launched, which the trust responded to. But by May this year, nothing had happened. Sir William emailed again to ask about progress, but the response again was that no decision had yet been made. Sir William now says: ""Silence reigns."" ""The issue is not that the government is obliged to support the trust's memorial,"" Sir William says. ""It is when we can expect a decision whether it will provide any financial support and, if so, how much and on what terms. On that hangs how we approach others to give to the project.""

93bec1d5998d,Burnham's provocative challenge to Starmer shows he is serious,,"Location: party conference. A fairly new prime minister is struggling for popularity with his party and the country at large, against a backdrop of grim economic choices. A popular, plain-speaking mayor enters the week talked up as a future leader  — and is doing little to dampen that speculation himself. The year is 2012, the prime minister is David Cameron and the mayor is Boris Johnson. But it could just as well be 2025, Sir Keir Starmer and Andy Burnham. Sometimes politicians of all parties flirt with the possibility of one day becoming leader in suggestive, coy, almost deniable ways. This is not an example of that. Burnham is being more overt. To the Telegraph, the Greater Manchester mayor gave a straight answer to a straight question: yes, he had been contacted by Labour MPs ""throughout the summer"" about the prospect of him returning to Westminster, where he was an MP for 16 years, to lead Labour and replace Starmer as prime minister. Burnham said this was ""more a decision for those people than it is for me"". He repeated that line in an interview with BBC Manchester. Well, up to a point. Burnham is not an MP. He would have to decide to become one if he wants to be Labour leader and prime minister. Labour's rule book dictates that the party leader must be an MP, so when the party is in government that means the prime minister must also be an MP, meaning they have to be elected to Parliament rather than made a member of the Lords. This means that his path to Downing Street is extremely complicated. First, a Labour MP would need to resign their seat so there is a by-election - unless a contest happened to arise through an MP dying or similar. Because of Burnham's distinctive regional pitch, the constituency would surely have to be in Greater Manchester or at least the north-west of England. Two Manchester Labour MPs, Andrew Gwynne and Graham Stringer, have already ruled out standing down for Burnham. Then, Burnham would have to be selected as Labour's candidate. This would require the approval of Labour's national executive committee, which for most purposes is controlled by allies of Starmer, although at least some of those would probably support Burnham's return to Westminster. Then, he would have to win the by-election in a difficult national political environment for the Labour Party. And then, finally, Burnham would have to secure the backing of 80 Labour MPs to challenge Starmer  - at which point presumably other candidates would enter the fray. There are a lot of difficulties along that path. Still, it is clearly a path that he is willing, at the very least, to publicly entertain. The mere existence of the Telegraph interview, alongside a long profile in the New Statesman, the bible of left-liberals, is pretty provocative. Burnham knew that he would be asked questions about his national ambitions, and that they would create a stir in the days before a crucial party conference for Starmer. Perhaps most notable, though, is that Burnham used both interviews to spell out a policy prospectus: higher council tax on expensive homes, borrowing to invest in council housing, cutting income tax for lower earners and increasing it for higher earners. In the New Statesman, he said: ""We've got to get beyond this thing of being in hock to the bond markets"". That is a direct challenge not just to Starmer but to Chancellor Rachel Reeves and her view  - her supporters and plenty of experts would say the economic reality  - that the government cannot borrow much more money. It is an argument that quite a few Labour MPs make, mostly in private: that this government has allowed itself to become too constrained by Treasury orthodoxy. To have Burnham joining that argument publicly, whether his leadership challenge is plausible or not, is unwelcome for Starmer and Reeves. In government, there is frustration and no small amount of bafflement that Burnham has decided to make these interventions now. One senior source said he was: ""A Boris-sized ego, but without the strategic thought."" Speaking from the main stage of Conservative conference back in 2012 (an honour not being afforded to Burnham at Labour's conference next week), Boris Johnson ended up rallying the members behind David Cameron. It took him seven years to get to No 10. It's hard to see the Starmer and Burnham story taking quite so long to play out, whatever the ultimate conclusion.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx275r1l3xpo,Politics,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/da0e/live/172696c0-99e9-11f0-ab25-c9c4c516f15a.jpg,2025-09-25T09:50:48.015000+00:00,238925805f5ba54834c3088b16ab6682e44c54db
f12bce52aabf,How long can the UK afford the pension triple lock?,,"How long can the UK afford the pension triple lock? Dharshini David Deputy economics editor and Raphael Sheridan Economics reporter BBC Glenys is concerned about people whose only income is the basic state pension At a weekly ballet class in Wokingham, dancers glide elegantly through an intricate series of poses, making it look easy despite ranging in age from 50 to over 80. Figures released on Tuesday, suggesting retirees will likely benefit from a 4.7% increase in the state pension from next April , will add a spring to those dancers' steps. Yet concerns remain. Glenys worries about those whose only income is the basic state pension. ""I do feel sorry for people that are struggling, if it's food or heat,"" she says. Meanwhile, former architect Mary says her children's generation are having to strive harder and for longer to afford to start a family or buy a home. ""My daughter's about to give birth, and she's beginning to contribute to a pension. But what it's going to be like for the new grandchild, I've no idea."" Glenys and Mary's reflections show not only the success of the triple lock system used to increase pensions but also raises questions around its fairness and its sustainability. The triple lock formula says that the state pension will rise in spring by the greater of 2.5%, the previous September's inflation rate, or the increase in average earnings registered over the previous summer. Because the earnings figure published on Tuesday morning is almost certain to be the highest of those three, it is likely the state pension will go up by 4.7% in April. The measure has helped to cut the number of pensioners living in poverty, but according to the minister who launched it, Sir Steve Webb, it's not job done yet. The UK's state pension is less generous than the average in rich countries, meaning we are more reliant on private savings. And the nature of the cost of living crisis of the past few years, centred on the staples like food and energy, has left those reliant on the state pension particularly stretched. It could get worse for some pensioners. The triple lock means the new state pension - for those who reached pension age after April 2016 - is creeping closer to the £12,570 threshold at which tax becomes payable. That threshold is set to be frozen until 2028, meaning people like former hairdresser Linda will soon likely end up paying income tax on their pension under current plans. ""You're given it in one hand and it's taken away in the other, so that's not a lot of good,"" she says. ""If they could raise the tax threshold, it would make a huge difference."" The state pension faces other issues. We are living longer and having fewer children, so the bill is booming and it is being footed by a falling share of the population. Already, funding the state pension accounted for almost £140bn in the last financial year, making it the second biggest claim on the public purse after health spending. And the amount spent is vulnerable to the kind of extremes in inflation we've seen in recent years, meaning it now costs about three times as much as its architects originally reckoned. Linda worries about having to pay tax on her state pension in the future Future sums threaten to be eyewatering. The government's own independent forecaster says that by 2070 the amount needed to fund the state pension will be equivalent to 7.7% of GDP - 50% higher than right now. That is quite an ask of taxpayers when other claims on the public purse are also projected to soar, in particular healthcare spending - largely for the same group of older Brits. As the costs mount, many economists say the triple lock might disappear. Keeping it going means shifting an increasing amount of resources from younger generations, workers and business owners, to older ones. The government has committed to keeping it in place for the rest of the parliament, but Pensions Minister Torsten Bell admitted in a previous role - as chief executive of the Resolution Foundation, a think tank that focuses on the plight of the lower paid - that the triple lock is a ""messy tool"". So what should replace it? In his previous job, Bell touted a system of increases that was shielded from spikes in inflation. Webb, who acknowledges the triple lock can't continue ""infinitely"", has mentioned a system of getting the pension to a certain proportion of average earnings – and then maintaining that. Others have floated the idea of linking it to inflation or earnings increases. The question is whether politicians would do any of this. The scrutiny in the run-up to the last election on the triple lock, and the row over the winter fuel payment , underscores what a sensitive topic pensioners' finances are with voters. That is not just the case with current retirees. Shortly after speaking to Linda, Glenys and Mary, we visited a board game night in Reading where players were mainly in their 20s and 30s. They pointed out that pensioners can still find it a struggle to afford the basics and, crucially, they themselves know that this is the scheme that they will have to rely on in some form. Small wonder that most politicians shy away from the issue where they can. There is an alternative, but not an enticing one. The Institute for Fiscal Studies reckons that we'd have to work until 74 to keep a lid on state pension spending. No-one said getting older was easy.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c9wdgk7ggezo,Politics,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/c07a/live/b2ce65e0-92cc-11f0-a72d-3fad567a173a.jpg,2025-09-16T09:04:55.401000+00:00,86c0560311218126e96b2d16bd5d6c033b347fab
777652698006,The blossoming relationship between Trump and Swinney,,"The blossoming relationship between Trump and Swinney Glenn Campbell Scotland political editor The White House John Swinney lobbied Donald Trump at a meeting in the White House John Swinney and Donald Trump remain at odds on a whole range of issues - but something has fundamentally changed in their relationship. On Wednesday, Scotland's first minister will don his sharpest evening wear to attend a State banquet at Windsor Castle in honour of the US president. Six months ago there seemed little chance that the SNP leader would have anything to do with President Trump's second state visit to the UK. In early March, Swinney said it was ""unthinkable"" the trip should go ahead following the Oval Office ambush of Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky. Trump has since lifted a pause on the US supply of weapons to Ukraine but his commitment to its defence against Russia remains in question. Swinney also criticised the Trump plan to take over Gaza and develop the coastline into a Riviera of the Middle East style resort, saying it would amount to ""ethnic cleansing"". But now he is set to join Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer and Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch at the Windsor banquet. Why has John Swinney's approach changed? The event has been boycotted by Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey in protest over US policy on Gaza, and Scottish Greens co-leader Ross Greer has urged Swinney to join the boycott. Swinney will be the only devolved first minister to attend. The Northern Ireland executive is being represented by DUP deputy first minister Emma Little-Pengelly. The Labour first minister of Wales, Eluned Morgan, has politely declined the King's invitation in order to lead tributes to a deceased political colleague in Cardiff. Reform UK's Nigel Farage has not been invited. So what has changed to alter John Swinney's approach? That was a question I put to him at a news conference in Edinburgh last week and his answer was fairly opaque. ""We've just got to get on with the world as we see it and as it is in front of us,"" he said. He was just off a plane from the United States, where he had been granted extraordinary access to the Oval Office to make the case directly to President Trump for the reduction or removal of US import tariffs or taxes on Scotch whisky. Scottish government Swinney is arguing for a reduction or removal of US import tariffs on whisky This is a pragmatic first minister who has clearly decided to engage with the US president where he sees an opportunity to influence his thinking, especially if it could benefit the Scottish economy. That does not prevent him from speaking up on issues of concern like Ukraine and Gaza, although he may need to be more diplomatic in how he makes those interventions. That is essentially the approach that Sir Keir Starmer has taken and he has managed to secure lower tariffs for UK produce entering the US market than those faced by other countries, including EU member states. UK negotiators have been working ahead of the state visit to secure further concessions on trade and Swinney has seized the opportunity to contribute to that effort on behalf of Scotch whisky. But given that trade is a UK government responsibility, not one for the Scottish government, how has he managed to get to the heart of the action? Reuters Trump opened his new golf course in Aberdeenshire during his visit to Scotland Donald Trump had a huge fallout with Alex Salmond when he was first minister over the Scottish government's support for offshore wind. The pivotal moment in changing relations with the Trumps was a meeting between John Swinney and President Trump's son Eric on Thursday 13 March. I remember it because it was kept secret in advance and I bumped into the first minister rushing down a back staircase to leave Holyrood after question time that day. He made no reference to where he was going, why he was in a hurry or why he was avoiding the usual route that would take him past a clutch of news reporters hoping to catch a word. This meeting was arranged at the request of the Trump Organisation, which has two golf resorts in Scotland at Turnberry in Ayrshire and Balmedie in Aberdeenshire. Both sides described it as a business discussion and insisted that politics were not mentioned, although the lines between those two spheres have become increasingly blurred since President Trump returned to office. Building a new relationship It seems the two most important words spoken at Eric Trump's meeting with the first minister at his official residence in Edinburgh were ""thank you"". Swinney thanked the Trump family for their investment in Scotland and the Trump team were taken aback because they said no-one in the Scottish government had previously bothered to say these words. A few months before, Eric Trump had called John Swinney ""nasty"" for endorsing Kamala Harris in the US presidential election campaign. It seemed this could now be put aside and a new relationship built. It may be worth noting that when the Trumps first came to Scotland seeking to build on the protected sand dunes of the Menie estate in Aberdeenshire, it was John Swinney who granted them planning permission, overturning local objections. He had been their ally in the past and perhaps he could be again. Reuters Keir Starmer had dinner with Donald Trump during his visit to Scotland this summer There is no suggestion that the Trump business has asked for anything specific from the Scottish government. However, it is a matter of record that Scottish ministers awarded public funds to support a golf tournament to be played at Trump International, as the Aberdeenshire business is officially known. That was announced in time for Donald Trump's visit to his Scottish golf resorts in July, which included a dinner with both the prime minister and the first minister in Aberdeenshire. Swinney had a breakfast meeting with the president the following morning before attending the opening of a new Trump golf course at which Donald Trump praised him as a ""terrific guy"". It was during this visit that Swinney said he took the opportunity to raise concerns about the impact of US tariffs on the whisky industry. He had heard the president say on arrival in Scotland that he did not realise that whisky was an issue, even though the UK government insists it was among the items on their trade agenda. Scottish government Swinney had a 50-minute conversation with Trump on his visit to Washington Swinney suspected steel and pharmaceuticals were higher on the UK's priority list and made a point of pressing the case for whisky with the president. He may then have been a little disappointed when Trump played down the extent of their discussion when he spoke to reporters aboard Air Force One on the flight back to America. But that was not to be the end of their conversation on whisky. The Scottish government followed up through US diplomats and Swinney decided to fly to Washington to lobby further, accepting an invitation to make his case directly to President Trump in the White House. He had a 50-minute conversation with the most powerful political leader in the western world. None of his predecessors as first minister have been afforded that amount of face time. Labour's Henry McLeish is the only previous holder of the office to have been granted a courtesy call to the Oval Office. This special access was supported by the then UK ambassador in Washington, Lord Peter Mandelson, before the extent of his past friendship with Jeffrey Epstein brought him down. Relaxing whisky tariffs 'a win-win' deal While Trump's Scottish heritage may have helped get Swinney in the door, the first minister said he did not trade on sentiment but instead presented a potential ""win-win"" business deal to Donald Trump. The proposal is that by relaxing tariffs on Scotch whisky he would not only ease a burden on Scotland's national drink but also boost demand in Scotland for used bourbon casks from Kentucky. A lot of whisky is matured in these second hand barrels and US distillers are working with the Scotch Whisky Association to appeal for a special trading arrangement - zero tariffs on Scotch entering the US and none on bourbon or used casks coming into the UK. Swinney's lobbying on this issue could be a political win-win for him too. If Trump agrees a deal, Swinney will be able to claim a share of the credit. If that does not happen, Swinney will argue that the UK government failed to bring home a deal that he set up. If there is blowback from within the SNP over his efforts to woo Trump that is not yet apparent. One party insider who is very cautious about Trump described Swinney as having played an ""absolute blinder"". One former Conservative adviser told me Swinney's approach was ""smart politics"". PA Media Scottish Secretary Douglas Alexander said whisky was very high up the UK's list of priorities What seems remarkable to me is that the first minister was able to develop this strategy under the noses of UK Labour ministers without any obvious challenge. They enabled him to run rings round them. The new UK Business Secretary Peter Kyle was in Washington talking tariffs the day before John Swinney, yet his department struggled to produce a statement for days. Perhaps the administration was distracted by the reshuffle following the resignation of Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner or the emerging crisis surrounding Lord Mandelson. Eventually, the new Scottish Secretary Douglas Alexander took to the airwaves to insist that the UK government had been ""thinking, working, talking and negotiating about whisky for many weeks and months"". He argued that whisky was ""very high"" up the list of priorities for the UK as it seeks further trade concessions from the US and warned Swinney against ""playing politics"". There is no certainty that whisky will get a special deal or that any announcement will come during Trump's state visit - but the industry has sensed in recent weeks that a better deal for them could be ""deliverable"". They would raise a glass to that if it happens and leave the politicians to squabble over who fought Scotch's corner the hardest.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3e75d7g49no,Politics,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/cb2b/live/071a8960-92de-11f0-950e-eb051178bae0.jpg,2025-09-17T06:07:24.876000+00:00,f677f380a7d8d4e0650cff237db5d2ee5a2cc0e5
f1fbeaddf06c,Scotland gives Trump three things he likes - and one thing he doesn't,,"Scotland gives Trump three things he likes - and one thing he doesn't Sarah Smith North America editor in Scotland Getty Images A list of Donald Trump's favourite things would be very unlikely to include raindrops on roses and whiskers on kittens (as Julie Andrews famously sang in The Sound of Music). Instead, the president's list would surely have on it playing golf, a way to brazenly promote his commercial interests and, thirdly, trade deals that generate billions of dollars for the United States. No wonder he looks so pleased with himself - his working holiday in Scotland has delivered on all three of these passions. On what was billed as a ""private visit"" he got a lot of work done. He is taking home with him a trade deal with the EU which is not only the largest in history, it is also extremely favourable to the US. The EU will spend hundreds of billions of dollars buying American energy and military equipment as well as investing billions more in the US economy. In return European goods will be subject to a 15% tariff when they are exported to the US rather than the 30% Trump had threatened. The deal is an important achievement for Trump to be able to boast about, even if he has failed to conclude the ""90 deals in 90 days"" he had promised. He also seemed to relish hosting Sir Keir and Lady Starmer at his Turnberry golf resort on Monday. It was a peculiar spectacle, the British prime minister being welcomed as guest in his own country. But the PM was prepared to overlook the protocol when he was being treated to an unusual and valuable amount of face time with the US president. Trump is, after all, a man whose foreign policy is abnormally influenced by his personal relations with other world leaders. Their talks were dominated by the crisis in Gaza. Starmer appeared to make some headway as he pressed Trump to use his influence to get more food into the Palestinian territory. Getty Images Starmer and wife Victoria were hosted by Trump at Turnberry Trump said afterwards that the US would work with the UK and other European partners to set up food centres, adding that he will tell Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu to ensure that food gets to people who need it. ""I want to make sure they get the food, every ounce of food."" He also seemed to give the green light to Starmer to officially recognise the state of Palestine even though that is not something the US will do. ""I'm not going to take a position, I don't mind him taking a position,"" he said. Trump also made a significant change to his position on the conflict in Ukraine. He revealed that he is now giving Russian President Vladimir Putin only 10-12 days to agree to a ceasefire, not the 50 days he had previously given him. ""There's is no reason in waiting… I want to be generous but we just don't see any progress being made."" All of these major announcements were made during an exceptionally long, wide-ranging and free-wheeling press conference, during which the US president appeared extremely relaxed. He was prepared to talk at length about anything from wind power to immigration, including his views on King Charles and the mayor of London, Sadiq Khan. Watch: Trump says he turned down an invitation to Epstein's island There was one issue he could not escape, much as he perhaps wanted to. He was inevitably asked about Jeffrey Epstein, as the long running controversy about why he is refusing to release all the files held by the US government on the deceased sex offender followed him across the Atlantic. A van displaying an old photograph of Trump at a party with Epstein was driving around Aberdeenshire to make sure the president could not escape the furore. He told us for the first time why he fell out with the disgraced financier many years ago, saying that Epstein had poached staff from Trump's Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida and he refused to talk to him after that. And he denied ever having sent a lewd drawing to Epstein (as reported by the Wall St Journal), claiming that he only ever draws very basic pictures of buildings. The intrusion of the Epstein scandal into Trump's Scottish trip was a reminder of what inevitably awaits him on his return to Washington but it did not seem to dent his buoyant mood. A few anti-Trump protests were staged. But they were largely kept away from the president himself and were remarkably muted compared with previous visits. The most determined demonstrators were Trump fans who turned out to greet him as he landed in Prestwick and at both golf resorts, holding large signs welcoming him to Scotland. The president also took every opportunity to use this trip to proudly promote his two Scottish golf resorts. He hosted the press conferences with Starmer and Ursula von der Leyen, head of the EU's executive, in the newly renovated ballroom at Turnberry, boasting of the opulent new ceiling and brand new windows at the same time as discussing famine in Gaza. Getty Images Starmer and Trump arrive by helicopter at Trump MacLeod House Arriving in Aberdeenshire with Starmer on board his Marine One helicopter, he took a couple of laps to show off the new golf course before landing. After talks with John Swinney on Tuesday morning, he had the Scottish first minister attend the official opening of the Trump International Golf Links in the village of Balmedie, along with several VIPs and a phalanx of TV cameras. It is exceptionally unusual for a US president to so nakedly use his office to promote his own commercial interests but it is something Donald Trump clearly revels in doing. Almost as much as he enjoys playing golf. Which he managed to do on almost every day of this trip.

1be69e4b2f5a,Badenoch hopes to grab attention with policy blitz,,"Badenoch hopes to grab attention with policy blitz Chris Mason Political editor 'To fix our country, we must reverse Labour's measures' says Badenoch The Conservatives have been one of the democratic world's most successful parties at winning elections. And yet a party used to standing so tall has shrivelled to Lilliputian levels. They have rarely, if ever, known a scenario so bleak. With that backdrop, a leader's position would always be questioned – and Kemi Badenoch's has been. But her speech to the party's annual conference was a confident performance, arguably her best moment yet as leader, and a fleshing out of her brand of Conservatism. She appeared relaxed and like she was enjoying herself, which is quite a thing given she would have been feeling the pressure of doing her first closing conference address as Conservative leader. The Tories spot a niche they hope they can own: to be perceived as wise custodians of the public finances. Despite the Liz Truss legacy, they have been buoyed by polling suggesting this is a perception they should lean into as a differentiator from Labour and Reform UK. What I have noticed over the last few days is something of a Darwinian selection among the people who came to the conference in Manchester. Yes, the numbers were down on where they were last year or when the party was in government, as you would expect. But those who turned up were up for the fight. I got chatting to one local party association chairman as activists headed for the station after Badenoch's speech. ""This gives us something to talk about with voters,"" they said with an approving smile, after the blitz of policy announcements in recent days. Stamp duty surprise As a new leader, Kemi Badenoch did not want to rush into announcing policies. This was partly out of a belief that you have got to think things through before you announce them. She likes to distinguish between policies and announcements, claiming her rivals will often make a splash with an idea that hasn't been properly thought through. The problem, though, is while all these policies were being worked up, the party didn't have much to say. The stand-out new policy in the speech, which the party had managed to keep under wraps until it was delivered from the lectern, was her plan to abolish stamp duty on main home purchases in England and Northern Ireland. The party sees stamp duty as a particularly bad tax, because it puts people off moving house. But the key thing here is that yes, the party has given itself something to talk about, but is anyone listening? Some of the leader's internal sceptics said they were pleasantly surprised by what they heard. Kemi Badenoch will hope this buys her some time and some attention. But in our noisy political ecosystem, neither is guaranteed.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cwywrpelp7jo,Politics,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/cacf/live/cbd4f390-a45d-11f0-92db-77261a15b9d2.jpg,2025-10-08T20:06:04.083000+00:00,aa9d1967197f5c6524e8117bf2eb3e3a09a23454
9cbd2a1269e7,Chris Mason: Why protests have started a debate over 'Britishness',,"Chris Mason: Why protests have started a debate over 'Britishness' Chris Mason Political editor EPA The Conservative Party conference in Manchester is taking place against a backdrop of grief and pain over last week's synagogue attack When a political party gathers for its annual conference, the host city (or at least the political and security bubble that surrounds the conference centre) becomes home to feverish and partisan political chat. What is different about the next few days is Manchester is also a city in mourning after the horrific attack on Thursday. There is, of course, still sharp political argument here but the emotional and practical backdrop is one of grief, fear and an ongoing police investigation. The flags outside the conference centre fly at half mast. A community just a few miles from here, but also all over the UK, is terrorised, frightened and grieving. Many Jewish people are furious more has not been done - for years - to protect them. And all this poses some of the biggest questions about who we are and what we hold dear. The other day the Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood pleaded with pro-Palestinian protesters not to head out onto the streets in the immediate days after the attack at the Heaton Park Synagogue. She argued that to do so would be ""un-British"". But others ponder just how British it is to curb repeated protests - the plan Mahmood now plans to legislate for. So what are the fundamental tenets of Britishness - a concept itself some would contest - under which a multicultural, multilingual, multireligious collection of nations such as the UK could agree on? Against the backdrop of pain and grief, this is a debate about some of the fundamentals of our society - democracy, protest, offence, tolerance (even tolerance for the intolerant) and proportionality. In addition to antisemitism, there is Islamophobia too. The home secretary talked over the weekend, rather euphemistically, about what she called ""community relations"" and others might put more baldly as racism and hatred. The Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch said the UK had tolerated what she called radical Islamist ideology ""for too long"". This element of the conversation around the dangers of Islamism and how it is countered is not new and itself infuriates many as we collectively wrestle with what to do about it. These are challenges for the home secretary, challenges for the government yes, but challenges for society as a whole.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c7840dv7n4po,Politics,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/afef/live/acb32710-a279-11f0-b741-177e3e2c2fc7.jpg,2025-10-06T06:01:51.849000+00:00,8b1de4374fa1c138867b726cc803bb2403668971
8ee7f100cb83,Starmer had to show his critics he can take on Farage,,"Starmer had to show his critics he can take on Farage Chris Mason Political editor Starmer questions if Reform wants to serve ""our beautiful, tolerant, diverse country"" Sir Keir Starmer was last year's big winner at the general election. This year saw the prime minister sharpening his argument against Nigel Farage and - by extension - against those within his own party, from the cabinet down, who fret he's not the best frontman for the fight that beckons with Reform UK. There is a defiance and steeliness to the prime minister; with this performance, he reminded his internal critics just who it was who won that whopping majority in the election 15 months ago. The year gone by has been a relentless grind – not least the last few weeks, after losing the former deputy PM Angela Rayner and US ambassador Peter Mandelson - and in his speech, the prime minister wanted to remind the audience of the achievements of the past months. His critics within the Labour party remind him, relentlessly, that Labour's politics must be politically more aggressive, front-footed and pointed in order to defeat a communicator of Nigel Farage's ability. This speech was the prime minister's response. It taught us little new about Sir Keir's political creed, but persistently painted the dividing line he wants: Reform versus everyone else. And he says he's the figurehead for that fightback. Farage has claimed his migration policy being labelled ""racist"" by the prime minister had put his staff at risk; it left him ""more determined than ever"", he said. Was Sir Keir Starmer's speech up to the challenge? Is this the point where the pace quickens? The prime minister is now approaching a bleak-looking Budget and a grim set of local elections, and elections in Wales and Scotland, next May. And even his most loyal allies accept those elections could determine if he's still delivering a conference speech to the assembled party as prime minister this time next year.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cpw1jwdlz7lo,Politics,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/6f98/live/049f4ce0-9e26-11f0-b741-177e3e2c2fc7.jpg,2025-09-30T17:52:33.029000+00:00,0c0d7501f6218fa32b8356e644d663a4634db3f8
caad761735e3,Labour grapples with threat from Reform UK at party conference,,"It is just 14 months since the general election. Not yet 500 days. Labour has a working majority of 161. But here on the banks of the Mersey, it really doesn't feel like that. I am reminded of Conservative conferences of old, where a circus would accompany Boris Johnson from the railway station to each and every event he attended, in the years when it was transparently clear he was rather keen on becoming prime minister. Swop a former mayor of London and subsequent prime minister for the current mayor of Greater Manchester and aspiring prime minister Andy Burnham, and you have a sense of the vibe here. There is no shortage of acidic views about what is seen as the rather thrusting nature of Burnham's ambition, or near hagiographic accounts of his governance of Greater Manchester as its mayor – with the clear implication he should stay there. But there is one big reason why all this is happening, so early in this parliament: it is symptomatic of a party wrestling publicly and privately with how it confronts Reform UK. There is broad and deep reflection from plenty here – from the cabinet to councillors – that the pitch right now from Labour to the country isn't good enough. This is why we are seeing a sharpening in the language and the policies being presented now. No fewer than 10 cabinet ministers are addressing this conference from the main stage on Monday. The centrepiece address will be from Chancellor Rachel Reeves, who will argue that Reform presents a threat to the British economy with the potential, she will argue, for more borrowing and rising barriers to international trade. But perhaps more striking is the speech from the new Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood. She has been dubbed 'the Terminator' by the tabloids. She gives every impression she might regard that nickname as a bit wishy-washy, a bit namby-pamby. ""You won't always like what I'll do,"" she will say, addressing Labour activists in front of her directly. In other words, her instincts and approach in the Home Office might make some within the party squeamish. But she sees it as absolutely essential – and the clue is in the candid observations she has already shared here at an event on the conference fringe. ""We can reclaim the mantle that was once ours and can be again: we will be the party of the working class,"" she said – an acknowledgement that, right now at least, they are not. It is a reflection, in a sentence, of how this party perceives its predicament and what it is trying to do about it.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cr701vn0rjmo,Politics,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/42a2/live/42a6d600-9d06-11f0-a8fe-677b0b0b2d56.jpg,2025-09-29T08:06:22.261000+00:00,9ca067e52da09bc744ea75a5b6b3e22cac66b74d
6dda1cf1f678,Nick Robinson: How the simmering row over freedom of speech in the UK reached boiling point,,"Nick Robinson: How the simmering row over freedom of speech in the UK reached boiling point Nick Robinson BBC ""At what point did we become North Korea?"" That was the question Nigel Farage posed when asked by a US congressional committee about limitations on freedom of speech in the UK. He was condemning the ""awful authoritarian situation we have sunk into"", which he claimed had led to various arrests including that of Father Ted co-creator Graham Linehan over his views on challenging ""a trans-identified male"" in ""a female-only space"". When I heard the question, I confess I thought that the leader of Reform UK had gone over the top. Farage was comparing his country - my country - with a brutal dictatorship that murders, imprisons and tortures opponents. And he was doing it in front of an influential audience of American lawmakers. Lucy North/PA Wire 'I don't regret anything I've tweeted,' Graham Linehan said earlier this month When I interviewed his deputy, Richard Tice on Radio 4's Today, I asked him whether he really believed that UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer was the same as North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. Three times I asked the question. Three times Tice swerved it, suggesting Farage was simply using ""an analogy"". But Farage is not alone in questioning how far restrictions to freedom of speech have gone in the UK. Tensions around the limits of free speech are nothing new and since the advent of social media in the mid-2000s, the arguments have been simmering. Now, though, they're reaching a boiling point. BENJAMIN CREMEL/AFP via Getty Images Farage lambasted the 'awful authoritarian situation we have sunk into' During his recent visit, US Vice-President JD Vance said he did not want the UK to go down a ""very dark path"" of losing free speech. The US business magazine Forbes carried an editorial this month that took this argument further still. In it, editor-in-chief Steve Forbes condemned the UK's ""plunge into the kind of speech censorship usually associated with tin pot Third World dictatorships"". He argues that, in stark contrast to the United States - where free speech is protected by the first amendment to the constitution, ""the UK has, with increasing vigour, been curbing what one is allowed to say, all in the name of fighting racism, sexism, Islamophobia, transgenderism, climate-change denial and whatever else the woke extremists conjure up"". So, how exactly did we get to the point where the UK is being compared to a dictatorship and, given how inflamed the conversation has become, what - if anything - would it take to turn down the heat? Big tech dialled up the debate The case of Lucy Connolly has become a cause celebre to some in the UK and beyond. The former childminder from Northampton, who is married to a Conservative councillor, had posted an abhorrent message on X, calling for people to ""set fire"" to hotels housing asylum seekers following the murder of three young girls at a dance class in Southport in July 2024. It was viewed hundreds of thousands of times at a time when the threat of violence was very real. Police/PA Wire Lucy Connolly was jailed for 31 months after calling for hotels housing asylum seekers to be set on fire Connolly had pleaded guilty to inciting racial hatred by publishing and distributing ""threatening or abusive"" written material on X. And yet she was given the red carpet treatment at the Reform party conference, as ""Britain's favourite political prisoner"". The length of her prison sentence - 31 months although she only served 40% before she was released - was questioned by many, including people who were appalled by what she had written. It is just one case that highlights how much social media has changed the shape of the debate around free speech and made heroes and villains of ordinary people. And I use the word ""ordinary"" deliberately because views similar to Connolly's will have been expressed up and down the land by others who might well have said, as she now does, ""I was an idiot"". But while it's unlikely that any action would have been taken had she said what she did in a coffee shop or a bar, the fact she posted it on social media changed things. ROBERTO SCHMIDT/AFP via Getty Images Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg has changed the rules for Facebook and Instagram What's more, big tech firms have changed their approach in recent years. After billionaire businessman Elon Musk bought Twitter, which he re-named X, he changed content moderation, which he regards as ""a propaganda word for censorship"" - and he talks a lot about people spreading ""the woke mind virus"". Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg has also changed the rules governing Meta and Instagram. In the case of Connolly, her post was ""accelerated by the algorithm"" and spread far more widely, according to Lilian Edwards, an emeritus professor at Newcastle University. Dilemma around policing speech The arrest of Graham Linehan at Heathrow, too, raised further questions around policing freedom of speech - and put the way issues are handled under renewed scrutiny. Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police Sir Mark Rowley has voiced his own concerns. ""It's a nonsense to pretend that with all of the (online) content out there that enforcement is the answer to that,"" he has said. What these cases both illustrate is the lack of consensus about what can and should be policed online in the UK, and by who. And a lack of consensus too about how we can set apart the unpleasant, offensive, ugly and hateful things said online from those that are genuinely threatening or dangerous. PA Sir Mark Rowley: 'It's a nonsense to pretend that with all of the content out there that enforcement is the answer' In the UK, the Human Rights Act does give protection to free speech but as a ""qualified right"". This means that ""governments can restrict that right… provided that the response is proportionate - [or] 'necessary in a democratic society' is what people tend to say"", according to Lorna Woods, professor of internet law at the University of Essex. But some of the comments made at the protest in London earlier this month, billed by far-right, anti-Islam activist Tommy Robinson as a ""free speech rally,"" demonstrate that, despite other controversies, that right isn't that qualified. Like nailing jelly to the wall ""Violence is coming"" and ""you either fight back or die"", Musk told flag-waving protesters via video link. Along with his call for the overthrow of the government, some might argue that his words at the rally were an incitement to violence. But the UK's independent reviewer of terrorism legislation, the barrister Jonathan Hall KC, has said that Musk's words would not have broken the law. ""Politicians use martial language all the time, don't they?"" he told BBC Radio 4's Today. ""Metaphors such as fights and struggles are pretty normal. And he was talking about it contingently, wasn't he? He wasn't saying: 'Go out immediately.'"" Reuters Musk called moderation ""a propaganda word for censorship"" Yet the fact both men were able to address a huge crowd in London is perhaps evidence that there is rather more leeway for free speech in this country than those likening the UK to a ""tin pot dictatorship"" suggest. According to Essex University's Prof Lorna Woods, the lowest level of views that can be prosecuted in British criminal law are those deemed ""grossly offensive or of an indecent, obscene or menacing character"". These are concepts that few people without a law degree could easily define, let alone agree upon. It is the job of the police initially, but ultimately the courts, to try to nail that particular piece of jelly to the wall. Universal History Archive/Universal Images Group via Getty Images Former deputy PM Sir Nick Clegg says the the UK is ""out of whack"" with other countries on free speech The UK is ""out of whack"" with other countries, according to Sir Nick Clegg, the former deputy prime minister who later became right-hand man to Zuckerberg. He believes the UK needs to ""think long and hard"" about ""whether we've overdone it"" on policing speech. ""Surely part of the definition of being in a free society is people say ghastly things, offensive things, awful things, ugly things, and we don't sweep them under the carpet,"" he has said. Free speech versus 'me speech' What the British public want is another story. Earlier this month, in a survey by YouGov, 5,035 British adults were asked what was most important when it came to online behaviour: 28% said it was that people were able to express themselves freely but 61% prioritised keeping them safe from threats and abuse. ""People tend to prefer safety to free speech [online],"" argues Anthony Wells, a director at YouGov. What's more, there seems to be a generational divide. Mark Kerrison / Getty Images and SOPA Images / Getty Images In a new YouGov survey, 61% of Britons said keeping people safe online was more important than absolute free speech In my conversations with young people in their 20s and 30s - the age of my own children - I often hear the view that far from being an ideal to be strived for, free speech is the cause of much of the anger, division and fear they live with every day. In recent years a ""cancel culture"" has emerged in which those with ""unacceptable"" views can be hounded out of their jobs, no platformed as speakers or intimidated as students. Even back in 2021, a YouGov poll of Britons found that a majority of those surveyed - some 57% - had sometimes stopped themselves from expressing political or social views because of the fear of being judged or negative responses. For those who believe that free speech is under threat in the country, these figures can be used as evidence that decades of political correctness has had a chilling effect on people's ability to express their opinions. ""Our definitions of what constitutes hate speech, and I think a very broadened definition of what constitutes harm, is meaning that people feel like they are walking on eggshells and they're frightened - not just that they'll have the police around, but that they'll be cancelled if they say the wrong thing,"" the former Brexit Party MEP Baroness Claire Fox told the BBC's The World Tonight. But dig deeper and this debate, like so much else, is also about politics and the deepening and, increasingly, angry and violent divisions in our society. What can America teach us? Even with its constitutional protection for free speech, plenty in the UK question what basis Americans have to lecture Britain on free speech, given the arguments they are having back at home. The anger and division sparked by the assassination of the conservative firebrand Charlie Kirk in Utah this month ramped up the debate further on that side of the Atlantic over where the boundaries should lie between what is offensive, hateful and dangerous. Michael Le Brecht/Disney via Getty Images ABC has suspended talk-show host Jimmy Kimmel over comments about the killing of right-wing influencer Charlie Kirk Trump's Attorney General Pam Bondi appalled many conservatives when she declared that, ""There's free speech and then there's hate speech"". It seemed to take her into precisely the territory, which has caused so many problems here in the UK. President Trump himself has threatened to sue the New York Times for $15bn (£11bn) over what he calls defamation and libel, adding to the long list of media outlets he has taken to the courts over stories - the newspaper has called it ""intimidation tactics"" - and he celebrated the sacking of the late-night TV host Jimmy Kimmel as ""great news for America"". The US historian Tim Snyder, who is an outspoken public critic of the direction America is heading under Trump believes that free speech should be distinguished from what he calls ""me speech"". Win McNamee/Getty Images Trump has threatened to sue the New York Times for $15 billion ""Me speech is a common practice among rich and influential Americans,"" writes Mr Snyder. ""Practitioners of me speech use the phrase free speech quite a bit. ""But what they mean is free speech for themselves. They want a monopoly on it. ""They believe that they are right about everything, and so they should always have giant platforms, in real life or on social media. ""The people with whom they disagree, however, should be called out and intimidated in an organised way on social media, or subjected to algorithmic discrimination so that their voices are not heard."" As much about listening This issue is one I've felt strongly about for as long as I can remember. My grandparents knew first hand what it was to be persecuted for who you were and what you thought or said. They were German Jews who fled the Nazis for what then was the relative security of China and later had to flee the Communists there. As a child, I recall watching in reverential silence as each day, after lunch, my grandfather held a huge radio on his lap and turned the dial, skipping stations until he found the BBC World Service. There, he had learned, he would find news he could trust and speech which was free of political control. So important was this to him that he had risked hiding with his wife and daughter (my mother) in a cupboard in their home in Shanghai to listen to it on a banned shortwave radio. Nick says he finds it hard to accept comparisons between the UK and a dictatorship That is why I find any comparison between the UK and a dictatorship a little hard to swallow. What I learned as the grandchild of those who had fled not one but two murderous ideologies was that free speech was about listening as much as talking. What mattered above all else is being able to hear both sides of an argument and learn the facts behind them - without having that information controlled by governments, rich and powerful media owners, or anyone else.

796a2f6086cd,Trump's state visit is mired with potential pitfalls despite careful planning,,"Trump's state visit is mired with potential pitfalls despite careful planning James Landale Diplomatic correspondent BBC Listen to James read this article US President Donald Trump's state visit to the United Kingdom this week will be no stranger to controversy, just as his first was six years ago. Back then, in June 2019, as well as taking tea with the late Queen, the US President called London Mayor Sadiq Khan ""a stone-cold loser"", backed Boris Johnson in a Tory leadership race and suggested the NHS should be part of US-UK trade talks. All this was accompanied by a petition saying he should not receive a state visit in the UK, signed by more than one million people, as well as noisy protests involving thousands and a huge inflatable effigy that became known as the Trump Baby. This week's second state visit – unprecedented for a non-royal - will prove the first was no exception. Mandel Ngan/AFP via Getty Images Trump being invited for a second state visit is unprecedented for a non-royal (pictured above during his previous visit, with First Lady Melania, in 2019) There will again be protests and Lord Mandelson's sacking as UK ambassador to the US has already cast a diplomatic pall over proceedings. Planning for the visit - over Wednesday and Thursday - has gone on for months, but for all the careful preparation, the possibility that things could go wrong is still very real. And for many of those organising it, the Mandelson affair is only one of their worries. How Windsor became 'Trumpton' For those at the royal end of the show, the focus has been on logistics and security - and turning Windsor Castle into a ring of steel hard enough to satisfy even the most fastidious secret service agents. Such has been the huge American presence some locals have renamed Windsor ""Trumpton"", after the eponymous town in the 1970s children's TV show. Mark Kerrison/In Pictures via Getty Images Detailed planning for the visit has gone on for months, down to banquet menus, seating plans and wording of the King's seven-minute speech For Palace officials, attention to detail is all. One of the biggest problems has been finding a place to muster the Household Cavalry. It needs to be far enough from the helicopter landing zones to ensure the horses are not spooked by the noise, close enough to form the escort quickly that will accompany the Trumps' carriage procession through the grounds of Windsor Castle. There has also been much discussion between the Palace and Foreign Office over who sits where at the State Banquet in St George's Hall. ""The value of these things are not just the photo opportunities but also all the off-grid conversations,"" said one royal insider. ""A huge amount of attention goes into the seating plan for the banquet. So people with certain policy areas are sat next to one another."" Jonathan Brady - WPA Pool/Getty Images One challenge has been making sure that the helicopter landing zones are positioned to ensure the horses of the Mounted Household Cavalry (pictured) are not spooked by the noise Much thought, too, is devoted to the menu and the music which will involve ""lots of nods to his Scottish heritage"". King Charles III's seven-minute speech at the banquet has gone through many drafts, ensuring he pushes the right buttons without crossing political lines. Officials say they have been given no indication by their US counterparts of what Trump may say in his speech. 'Pressure to make this massive' So far, so logistical – but the key challenge for royal organisers has been finding a way of ensuring Trump feels he has been given a full state visit with all the trimmings. That is no easy task. The president is on the ground for less than 48 hours and will not visit Downing Street, address Parliament or even find time to play a round of golf. ""There has been a large amount of government pressure to make this massive and that's been the challenge,"" one courtier told me. Jeff Gilbert - WPA Pool/Getty Images President Trump (pictured on his first state visit to the UK) will return for a second state visit this Wednesday and Thursday The scale of the ceremonial at Windsor has been stepped up, with 1,300 troops and 120 horses involved - far more than those used when President Macron of France visited earlier this year. (It's a point that will no doubt be emphasised to the Americans in private.) For the ceremonial hoopla is the overwhelming focus of the White House in this visit; a chance for the President to be photographed with the King and Queen and the Prince and Princess of Wales, along with military parades and bands and the Red Arrows. One Whitehall source said: ""The focus is very much on the optics, the historic moment, the pomp. For Trump it's all about TV and this is great TV."" Another said: ""It's theatre. It's all show. It's not like we are going to do deep substance. We are sucking up to the most powerful guy in the world for good reason."" Peter Nicholls/Getty Images Members of the Guard of Honour rehearse the ceremonial welcome The Trumps: Warm and solicitous guests Lord McDonald, a former top civil servant in the Foreign Office, said the UK's strategic choice to afford the most powerful man in the world ""the fullest honour British protocol allows"" will be watched closely by the rest of the world. ""This state visit is not just a UK-US event,"" he said. ""It will be one of the biggest stories around the world. ""The rest of the world will be looking at London and Windsor, burnishing the UK's wider international standing."" Many officials are confident the visit will go smoothly, simply because all sides want it to succeed. They emphasise that Palace staff thought the Trumps were warm and solicitous guests in 2019, both keen not to put a foot wrong. Mandel Ngan/AFP via Getty Images President Trump and King Charles will both make speeches at a banquet during the state visit ""Trump can be quite funny in private,"" said one diplomat. ""He has got quite a neat turn of phrase that the King will appreciate."" For the UK government, the overwhelming aim is for Air Force One to take off on Thursday evening with Trump warmly disposed to Britain. Serious business behind the pageantry Beyond providing a day of royal pageantry, the government has business to conduct on Thursday when proceedings move to the prime minister's country residence at Chequers. Ministers hope to complete a deal to exclude UK steel and aluminium from US tariffs. There will be some new civil nuclear cooperation. The centrepiece is set to be the signing of a technology partnership, involving new investment in Britain and greater cooperation with Silicon Valley on artificial intelligence and quantum computing. This was Lord Mandelson's priority, something he described in his outgoing letter to embassy staff last week as ""my personal pride and joy"", that he claimed would ""help write the next chapter of the special relationship"". All these issues will be portrayed as big domestic ""wins"" to help promote the government's growth agenda. Carl Court - Pool/Getty Images Ministers hope to complete a deal to exclude UK steel and aluminium from US tariffs The visit will also provide Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer with a significant opportunity to bend the ear of the president just a week before the United Nations general assembly in New York, especially on Ukraine. Jeremy Hunt, who as Foreign Secretary was heavily involved in the last Trump state visit, said this was a key chance to shape the president's thinking. ""Trump appears to be on a journey away from Putin, towards recognising that he needs a way of standing with his European allies a bit better,"" Hunt said. ""What the government will really be wanting to do is continue that journey, looking for a deal to impose more sanctions on countries buying Russian oil."" Leon Neal/Getty Images Planning has heavily focused on security - and turning Windsor Castle into a ring of steel Sophia Gaston, senior research fellow at King's College London, said the state visit was an important chance for the UK to influence US policy at a crucial stage of the Trump administration, a window of opportunity between its disruptive first six months and next year when its focus may shift to domestic elections and strategic competition with China. ""We are moving into a new phase,"" she said. ""This state visit really does matter. It is about us securing a foothold as the primary symbolic and strategic ally of the United States."" The Mandelson question For all these potential gains, the risks are huge and the most obvious involves, of course, Lord Mandelson. The peer's dismissal as ambassador, after revelations of the scale of his friendship with Jeffrey Epstein following Epstein's conviction as a paedophile, means the press conference at Chequers on Thursday will not be dominated by questions about his future. Instead, the prime minister will likely be asked why he appointed the peer in the first place and why he took so long to sack him; what did he know and when? Carl Court/Getty Images The PM will likely be asked why he appointed Lord Mandelson and why he took so long to sack him Some diplomats wonder if Trump may voice an opinion about who should replace Lord Mandelson, potentially putting No 10 in an invidious position. But perhaps the most dangerous question for the Prime Minister may be why he thinks Lord Mandelson should be punished for his links to Epstein, but not the US President standing next to him. According to Whitehall sources, this was a point Lord Mandelson deployed as he fought to save his job. It was not an argument that found favour in No 10 and officials note Trump, unlike Lord Mandelson, cut ties with Epstein well before his conviction - but it is a question that will float above this week's royal and political ceremonial. Jim Watson/AFP via Getty Images Lord Mandelson, who has been sacked as UK ambassador to the US, pictured with Trump and Vance Diplomats I have spoken to insist that so far the White House has been sanguine - if not a little bemused - at Lord Mandelson's departure, saying it is the UK's business, and the president remains excited about the state visit. But there is a fear among some that if Trump were dragged into the controversy and embarrassed at the press conference, then that could sour his mood – and the visit. Profound differences in the UK and US The Mandelson affair is not the only potential challenge. As one distinguished former British ambassador told me: ""On values and policies, we have fundamental differences with the Trump administration – on Nato, Ukraine, Middle East and China. ""The differences are more profound than at any time since World War Two."" Perhaps the most acute difference that could overshadow the visit relates to the Middle East. Next week the UK is expected to formally recognise Palestinian statehood in an attempt to keep alive the idea of a so-called ""two state solution"". But the Americans are strongly opposed, as the Secretary of State, Marco Rubio, made clear on Friday, emphasising his commitment ""to fight anti-Israel actions including unilateral recognition of a Palestinian state that rewards Hamas terrorism"". Getty Images Protests took place in the UK during Trump's last state visit, and there was a huge inflatable effigy that became known as the Trump Baby There are also political risks for the prime minister. Underlying this state visit is an unspoken transaction: that it is worth giving Trump all those trimmings in order to help British interests, namely to reduce tariffs and foster investment partnerships. Yet Trump is unpopular in the UK. A YouGov poll in July found only 16% of Britons surveyed say they have a positive view of him. The government will have to explain to voters why it believes this state visit is a price worth paying to try to grow the British economy. The diplomatic game of cards Amid these potential pitfalls lies a deeper, but less discussed risk from this state visit. That is: in its diplomatic game of cards, has the government played its King too explicitly for political purposes? ""The government have the convening power of the King and they have used it in a very transactional way, for example the brandishing of the King's letter in the Oval Office,"" said one royal source. ""They realise the Palace can draw people in, in a way that you can't in Whitehall. Peter Summers/Getty Images There have only ever been three state visits by US presidents: President Bush in 2003; President Obama in 2011 and President Trump in 2019 ""The problem in using the personality of the monarch and the institution of the monarchy is there is a risk that you cross a line and you ask someone who has to remain studiously non-political to transact a political act on behalf of the government."" Official state visits by US presidents are rare. There have only ever been three: President Bush in 2003; President Obama in 2011 and Trump in 2019. All other visits were official or informal. So this week's does matter. But even if it passes off smoothly and gaffe-free questions may remain about its efficacy. ""This is very early in Trump's presidency,"" one diplomat said. ""Have we played this card too soon? What do we do for an encore?""

d85289a2b48f,"Starmer resets after Rayner row, but Labour turmoil is a gift for Reform",,"Starmer resets after Rayner row, but Labour turmoil is a gift for Reform Laura Kuenssberg Presenter, Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg BBC Welcome to the weird world of UK politics 2025. The TV presenter Jeremy Kyle announces to a huge crowd of Nigel Farage supporters at Reform UK's party conference that David Lammy is the new number two in government and they boo, panto-style. And there's a YouTube video of the (now former) deputy prime minister dancing in a tracksuit and chunky gold chain waving wads of cash that's been watched more than 1.5m times. These might both sound like parodies, but only the video of Angela Rayner rapping ""How Many Homes Can Rayner Buy"" was a joke. And what was planned as No 10's ""get back in charge week"" has been blown up by a row you couldn't make up – the housing secretary in trouble for not paying tens of thousands of pounds of tax on her expensive new house. Her exit pushed the button on a chunky shakeup of Sir Keir Starmer's team. The start of this political season has been wild. Arron Chown/ PA Both Rayner's team and No 10 felt she had to go In the end, Rayner's decision to go was clear cut. The official report into her behaviour said she'd tried to do the right thing, but not tried hard enough. So the rules had been broken. Her camp reckoned she had no option. No 10 agreed. There is frustration that the manner of her exit from government gave her critics what they wanted. But she knew she had no choice, and was devastated by her own mistake. It's acutely and specifically painful for Labour because Rayner had personally styled herself as something of a sleaze-buster. It was she who often led the charge against the succession of Conservatives who got into trouble over their own complicated financial arrangements, hurling accusations of arrogance and greed on a fairly regular basis. She was the shoutier end of Starmer's so called ""Mr Rules"" approach, a serious belief that government had to be washed clean of its tawdry image after multiple scandals and Boris Johnson's, ahem , flexible attitude to the normal rules. She portrayed herself as a loud and proud champion of ordinary people looking at the worst Westminster behaviour in disgust. Jane Barlow/ PA Rayner had styled herself as something of a sleaze-buster For Labour in general, it undermines again, their claim to be different to those who went before, to return government to the ""service of the people"", as Sir Keir said so many times – to be competent, with clean heels. For the government's number two to have messed up her tax affairs undermines faith in ministers' ability. As one MP put it, ""it's not even a rookie error, it's 40,000 smackers of oversight"". And for such a prominent politician to lose their job over property dealings that many of the public couldn't imagine being able to afford gives the impression, again, that politicians live in a different world. ""There's just the smell test,"" a Labour insider said. Chris Jackson / PA Angela Rayner, Sir Keir Starmer and Rachel Reeves all came under fire for accepting  permitted freebies This time last year, Rayner, the prime minister himself, and even the chancellor were all red faced for taking, albeit permitted freebies, of clothes, glasses, and gig tickets, struggling to explain why politicians are entitled to free stuff the rest of us are not. Twelve months on, Rayner is the fifth minister who has quit after their actions caused embarrassment for the government. Those clean heels look a bit scruffy now. Getty Images Nigel Farage moved forward his conference speech after Rayner's resignation The mess is, of course, a gift for Nigel Farage. At his party's conference in Birmingham on Friday Rayner's exit didn't just shove him on stage a few hours early for his speech to try to grab a space in the news cycle, it gave more ammunition to his fundamental argument. Reform's pitch rests on a claim that the two big parties are as bad as each other, and preside over a system that is bust. Does his vow he could stop the small boats in a fortnight stand up? We've been speaking to the Reform leader, and our full interview will be on the show on Sunday. Andy Rain/ EPA /Shutterstock David Lammy is the new deputy prime minister The prime minister's answer to the drama of the last couple of days? Making changes to his ministers. The decisions were made finally because of Rayner's exit but the moves have been long in the making. Downing Street's hope is to salvage opportunity out of what was fast morphing into a crisis. A No 10 source tells me: ""None of us expected it to unfold as it did, but this gives real shape and substance to a refreshed No 10 team, marking a strong new phase of this premiership."" You and I might translate that as: ""The saga over Angela's tax was a total pain in the neck, but it's given us the excuse to make some of the changes we fancied anyway."" One insider described it as moving those who were ""a bit awkward, or a bit tired"". Aaron Chown/ PA Some hope Shabana Mahmood will take a more strident approach on small boats as the new home secretary What those changes add up to depends on who you ask. One ally of the PM tells me, the reshuffle ""is all about immigration"", believing ""Shabana [Mahmood] is the one who can get a grip of this"" to solve the small boats issue or ""we're all done for"". Some of Starmer's allies have long admired Shabana Mahmood, and believe her elevation to home secretary will bring a more forthright approach to cracking the problems of the immigration system. As justice secretary she held out the possibility of castrating sex offenders. That is not exactly a proposal designed to warm the hearts of Labour Party branch meetings. But in some government circles there's a hope she'll take a more strident approach to the small boats crisis than Yvette Cooper. Andy Rain/ EPA /Shutterstock Yvette Cooper will have to contend with a visit from President Donald Trump within days of taking up the foreign brief Cooper moves to a life where she'll spend a lot more time on a plane, as foreign secretary. But those close to her believe it's a tribute to her work doing deals with countries on migration in this last year that she has been given the arguably more prestigious job. I wouldn't bet we'll see her meeting JD Vance in waders any time soon. But there is the small matter of a state visit from his boss, President Trump, in a matter of days. Different sources point to other appointments as the ones that will make the difference. The government's often stated number one priority has been to get the economy growing. You don't need me to tell you they haven't been having a great time with that. Sources suggest moving Pat McFadden, the wily political brain, into a new mega ministry to deal with welfare and skills is part of a souped-up attempt to get the country working, and moving Peter Kyle to business is a way to soothe fevered brows of industry. He takes the seat of Jonathan Reynolds, who moves to the vital role of chief whip. Given how many ructions there were on the backbenches last term, despite the party's mega majority, Reynold's fortunes keeping the party on side, or not, will be critical. Phil Noble / Reuters Angela Rayner's exit from government has brought on a change in the prime minister's top team But while the reshuffle was a major set of moves, will it dramatically change what you see from the government that runs the country? Don't expect big swerves. This is not a reshuffle that has come about because of some massive ideological bust up. It seems more about the personalities of the ministers involved than any dramatic shifts in Starmer's ambition. His allies say in the first year in office he was frustrated at how hard it was to get anything done. The hope is the new line up will work more quickly, and push harder on the government's most thorny problems. One minister said the ""time for incremental change has passed – we don't have long"", conscious all the time of Reform breathing down their neck. Will it work? That's what we'll witness as the months unfold. A senior Labour figure told me disappointedly: ""I'm not sure moving personnel is the best thing – the biggest frustration is the lack of project – that's what makes it hard to make day to decisions."" This reshuffle doesn't answer the most frequent complaint made about Sir Keir by his own party, often publicly, that it's just not that clear exactly what he stands for. ""Phase 2"" was meant to be ""delivery, delivery, delivery"". Another bout of political jargon that followed, ""change"", ""renewal"", ""security"", ""fairness"", ""milestones"", ""first steps"", you get the point. Even some of the PM's allies would admit privately that none of his chosen pitches to the public have made people's hearts sing. ""You can see the problem from Mars,"" another party insider says, ""there's not enough political direction of what he wants to do – so the policies don't lather up into anything"", they reckon. That oft-cited problem is not going to be miraculously solved by a set of HR decisions after a huge embarrassment this week. But Sir Keir's hope this weekend will be that a reboot at the cabinet table makes his government more effective - demonstrating government can work. And convincing the public of that these days would be a significant achievement. House of Common / UK Parliament/ PA The start of Sir Keir Starmer's phase two of government has not quite gone to plan Seven days ago there was an ambition that week one of ""phase two"" might be an orderly start to the term. The Rayner saga skewered that plan. Now with his new chosen team in place there is more opportunity to make things work perhaps, but fewer excuses if things go wrong. A senior party source told me: ""The test is how does the PM show how No 10's capacity for political strategy and policy making have materially changed?"" With a long list of problems and the party conference looming, we'll soon know if Downing Street can pass that test, to prove it can manage the many challenges of ""phase two"" any better than the agonies of year one.

1fc83dede9b6,Clashes erupt between Hamas forces and armed clan members in Gaza City,,"At least 27 people have been killed in fierce clashes between Hamas security forces and armed members of the Dughmush family in Gaza City, in one of the most violent internal confrontations since the end of major Israeli operations in the enclave. Masked Hamas gunmen exchanged fire with clan fighters near the city's Jordanian hospital, witnesses said. A senior official in the Hamas-run interior ministry said security units surrounded them and engaged in heavy fighting to detain them. The ministry said eight its members were killed in ""an armed assault by a militia"". Medical sources said 19 Dughmush clan members and eight Hamas fighters had been killed since fighting began on Saturday. Eyewitnesses said the clashes erupted in the Tel al-Hawa neighbourhood in southern Gaza City after a Hamas force of more than 300 fighters moved to storm a residential block where Dughmush gunmen were entrenched. Residents described scenes of panic as dozens of families fled their homes under heavy gunfire, many of them displaced multiple times during the war. ""This time people weren't fleeing Israeli attacks,"" one resident said. ""They were running from their own people."" The Dughmush family, one of Gaza's most prominent clans, has long had a tense relationship with Hamas, and its armed members have clashed with the group on several occasions in the past. The Hamas-run interior ministry said its forces were seeking to restore order, warning that ""any armed activity outside the framework of the resistance"" would be dealt with firmly. Both sides traded accusations over who was responsible for triggering the clashes. Hamas earlier said Dughmush gunmen killed two of its fighters and wounded five others, prompting the group to launch an operation against them. However, a source from the Dughmush family told local media that Hamas forces had come to a building that once served as the Jordanian Hospital, where the family had taken refuge after their homes in the al-Sabra neighbourhood were destroyed in the recent Israeli attack. The source claimed that Hamas sought to evict the family from the building to establish a new base for its forces there. Hamas has recalled about 7,000 members of its security forces to reassert control over areas of Gaza recently vacated by Israeli troops, according to local sources. Reports suggest armed Hamas units have already deployed across several districts, some wearing civilian clothes and others in the blue uniforms of the Gaza police. The Hamas media office denied it was deploying ""fighters in the streets"".",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cg5e551j593o,World (International),BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/8a5b/live/b6705660-a7b5-11f0-b741-177e3e2c2fc7.jpg,2025-10-12T18:32:42.203000+00:00,991c93cae6793ef0c66882caf8e48dacfd70111d
a6009578fcaf,China accuses US of 'double standards' over tariff threat,,"Donald Trump's latest threat to impose an additional 100% tariff on Chinese goods is ""a typical example of US double standards"", China's government has said. A commerce ministry spokesperson also said China could introduce its own unspecified ""countermeasures"" if the US president carries out his threat, adding it was ""not afraid"" of a possible trade war. On Friday, Trump hit back at Beijing's move to tighten its rules for rare earths exports, accusing it  of ""becoming very hostile"" and trying to hold the world ""captive"". He also threatened to pull out of a meeting with China's President Xi Jinping later this month. But on Sunday, Trump wrote: ""Don't worry about China, it will all be fine!"" ""Highly respected President Xi just had a bad moment. He doesn't want Depression for his country, and neither do I. The U.S.A. wants to help China, not hurt it!!!"" Trump said in a post on social media, without elaborating further. Trump's comments on Friday rattled financial markets, with the S&P 500 share index closing down 2.7%, its steepest fall since April. The president's words renewed fears of a trade war between the US and China. In May, the two sides had agreed to drop triple-digit tariffs on each others' goods. which had raised the prospect of trade halting between the two countries. This left US tariffs on Chinese goods facing an added 30% levy compared with the start of the year, while US goods entering China face a 10% tariff. China's response - released by the commerce ministry in the form of written responses to journalist's questions - echoed language from the height of the recent trade conflict. They criticised US export restrictions on chips and semi-conductors as well as defending China's own export controls on rare earths as ""normal actions"" to safeguard national security and that of all nations. The spokesperson said that for ""a long time"", the US had ""overstretched the concept of national security, abused export control measures"" and ""adopted discriminatory practices against China"". ""Resorting to tariff threats is not the right way to engage with China,"" the spokesperson said. ""China's position on a tariff war has always been consistent: we do not want one, but we are not afraid of one."" Last week, China announced it was tightening export controls on rare earths and other materials critical for advanced tech manufacturing. This was seen as key move, as the country processes about 90% of the world's rare earths, which are used in goods such as solar panels and smartphones. The recent comments from Washington and Beijing are being seen by some as a means of strengthening positions ahead of future trade talks. It is unclear whether a meeting between Trump and Xi, expected at a summit in South Korea later this month, will still proceed.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn828kg8rmzo,World (International),BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/4ee2/live/d603cc70-a754-11f0-86ee-bde5491c9148.jpg,2025-10-12T17:43:27.971000+00:00,a1f5f03af6c24b1aa58bf3112978321f49b2935e
a5ed8b4e7e92,Afghan Taliban says Pakistani troops killed in 'retaliatory' border attacks,,"Islamabad has accused Kabul of harbouring terrorists who target Pakistan on its soil, a claim the Taliban government rejected. Both the Afghan and Pakistani sides are said to have used small arms and artillery in the Kunar-Kurram region, the BBC understands. At a press conference on Sunday, Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid said in addition to the 58 Pakistani military deaths, around 30 others had been wounded. He added that nine Taliban fighters had died and between 16 and 18 people had been injured. Pakistan Armed Forces said 29 of its soldiers had been injured, and the number of wounded Taliban and ""affiliated"" fighters was in the hundreds. Afghanistan’s foreign minister said in a press conference in New Delhi that ""we have no problems"" with Pakistan's people and its leadership but added ""there are some groups in Pakistan that are trying to spoil the situation. Afghanistan has a right to keep its territory and its borders safe, and so it has retaliated to the violation."" Pakistan's interior minister said he ""strongly condemns"" the Taliban's attacks: ""The firing by Afghan forces on civilian populations is a blatant violation of international laws. ""Afghanistan is playing a game of fire and blood,"" he said in a post on X. The two main crossings between Pakistan and Afghanistan - Torkham in the north and Chaman in the south - have been closed, leaving hundreds of trucks carrying goods stranded on both sides. A Pakistani military spokesman said they would take necessary measures to safeguard Pakistani lives and properties. Pakistan's military has not officially commented, but a security source speaking to the BBC claimed that firing took place at several locations along the Pakistani-Afghan border, including Angoor Adda, Bajaur, Kurram, Dir, Chitral and Baramcha. A police official stationed near the Zero Point in Kurram district told the BBC that heavy weapons fire began from the Afghan side around 22:00 local time (17:00 GMT). He said they had received reports of intense gunfire from multiple locations along the border. Last week, Afghanistan's Taliban government accused Pakistan of violating Kabul's ""sovereign territory"" , as two loud blasts were heard in the city late on Thursday. Pakistan bombed a civilian market in the border province of Paktika, in Afghanistan's south-east, the Taliban Defence Ministry said on Friday. Locals there told the BBC's Afghan service that a number of shops had been destroyed. A top Pakistani general alleged Afghanistan was being used as a ""base of operation for terrorism against Pakistan"". Pakistan has long accused the Afghan Taliban of permitting the Pakistan Taliban,  known as the TTP, to operate from their land and fight against the Islamabad government in a bid to enforce a strict Islamic-led system of governance. The Afghan Taliban government has always denied this. The latest escalation coincided with an historic week-long trip to India made by Afghan Taliban Foreign Minister Amir Khan Muttaqi, his first since the Taliban's return to power. In a diplomatic thaw, New Delhi said that it would reopen the embassy in Kabul, which was shut four years ago. ""Afghanistan will also be given a befitting reply like India, so that it will not dare to look at Pakistan with a malicious eye,"" Naqvi warned. In a statement, Saudi Arabia, which signed a mutual defence pact with Pakistan last month, called for self-restraint and avoidance of escalation between Islamabad and Kabul. Qatar also expressed concern over the Pakistan-Afghanistan border tensions, calling on both sides to ""prioritise dialogue, diplomacy, and restraint"".",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cgmzmn4971zo,World (International),BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/c057/live/818d4a50-a753-11f0-b741-177e3e2c2fc7.jpg,2025-10-12T11:58:23.238000+00:00,abb20d3d2a27bf678c6db52dda6479bdab334403
2183711189cc,Madagascar presidency says attempt to seize power under way,,"Madagascar presidency says attempt to seize power under way Sammy Awami reporting from Madagascar and Farouk Chothia AFP via Getty Images Some troops joined protesters in the capital on Saturday The office of Madagascar's President Andry Rajoelina has said an attempt to seize power illegally and by force is under way in the country. Hours later, an army unit known as CAPSAT claimed that it had taken over the leadership of the military command, and was now in control of all the armed forces - land, air, and naval. This is the same unit that played a crucial role in the 2009 Malagasy political crisis, which helped Rajoelina rise to power. Madagascar was first hit by youth-led protests on 25 September against water and power cuts, but they have escalated to reflect wider dissatisfaction with Rajoelina's government over high unemployment, corruption, and the cost-of-living crisis. Rajoelina's whereabouts are unclear, but in a statement he said ""there is an attempt to seize power at this time in the territory of the Republic, in complete violation of the Constitution and democratic principles,"" in a translation. He condemned ""in the strongest possible terms"" what he called an attempt to destabilise the country. He also called on all of the nation's key forces to unite in defending the constitutional order and national sovereignty. CAPSAT said it had appointed a new army chief of staff, Gen Demosthene Pikulas, according to a statement issued on its Facebook page. AFP news agency reports armed forces minister Manantsoa Deramasinjaka Rakotoarivelo has accepted the appointment. ""I give him my blessing,"" the minister was quoted as saying at a ceremony to install Gen Pikulas to the post. Protesters have gathered at the main square in the capital, Antananarivo, for the second consecutive day. This is a significant development, as they had failed to reach May 13 Square, the focal point of previous uprisings, until now. A protester told the BBC that they had ""finally conquered May 13 Square - the Square of Democracy"". ""We're happy and relieved. It's a great victory. We won't stop the struggle until President Rajoelina resigns,"" the protester added. Protesters have been celebrating their success in reaching the main square in Antananarivo The success of the demonstrators came after they received unexpected support from CAPSAT on Saturday, when some of its troops left their barracks to join the demonstration. CAPSAT had condemned the use of force against protesters by other security units. There were reports of a shoot-out at a CAPSAT camp on Sunday, following similar reports on Saturday. CAPSAT said one soldier was shot by gendarmes on Saturday, and died. Air France said it had suspended its flights to Antananarivo until at least Tuesday because of the security situation. The African Union said it was deeply concerned by the latest developments in Madagascar, and urged sides to resolve the crisis through dialogue. The protest movement, known as Gen Z Mada, has been rallying support mainly through social media, posing the biggest challenge to Rajoelina since his re-election in 2023. Some of the protesters have been wearing T-shirts and holding banners with a symbol - a skull with a straw hat from the Japanese manga series ""One Piece"" - used by youth-led demonstrators in other countries, including Indonesia and Peru. On Saturday, a statement from the presidency had assured the nation that Rajoelina and the new prime minister - an army general he appointed last week - were in control of the situation. AFP via Getty Images Some soldiers left their barracks to throw their weight behind the protest movement UN human rights chief Volker Türk previously urged security forces to stop using ""unnecessary and disproportionate force"" to quell the unrest. He said at least 22 people were killed and 100 others injured. Rajoelina disputed the figure last week, saying there were 12 confirmed deaths and ""all of these individuals were looters and vandals"". Madagascar has been rocked by multiple uprisings since it gained independence in 1960, including mass protests in 2009 that forced then-President Marc Ravalomanana to step down and saw Rajoelina come to power. Rajoelina governed for four years and then returned to power after the 2018 election. Despite its natural resources, Madagascar is one of the poorest countries in the world, with 75% of people living below the poverty line, according to the World Bank. Only about one-third of Madagascar's 30 million people have access to electricity, according to the International Monetary Fund (IMF).

Community members gathered on Saturday for a candlelit vigil outside the Maple Valley Baptist Church after a blast at local explosives factory Accurate Energetic Systems (AES) left 16 people presumed dead. This community of Hickman and Humphreys Counties is ""not huge, so that's a lot of people to lose in an instant,"" Deacon Danny Bates said to the approximately 40 attendees, who comforted each other and sang hymns such as ""It Is Well With My Soul"". ""It was just another day at work, and then in an instant, they were gone. We have unanswered questions"". A concrete barrier on the side of a road reads ""Pray for AES families"". Vigil-goer Jerri Newcombe said her friend of more than 20 years was among the victims. The two met when Newcombe's granddaughter and the victim's daughter became close as little girls. ""They grew up together - we were in each other's homes,"" Newcombe told the BBC at the vigil. ""We celebrated birthdays together. It's just surreal, because she's gone and her babies are hurting,"" she said, referring to the victim's children and grandchildren. Local police have not publicly identified any of the unaccounted-for victims, who authorities presume have all been killed. Her friend was ""full of life"", Ms Newcombe said. ""She was the type of person that could make you laugh over anything, but you didn't cross her either, or she would tear into you,"" Ms. Newcombe added amid tears and laughter, as her granddaughter comforted her. Bucksnort is a close-knit town where the cell service is spotty and a gas station - adorned with a Confederate flag centrepiece - is the local watering hole, residents say. This tragedy has hit the area hard as the community mourns family, friends, neighbours and coworkers. The town had been holding out hope for good news after the explosion on Friday morning shook homes across the area, clouded the skies with smoke and drew a surge of hundreds of state and national first responders to an otherwise sleepy community tucked behind forests along a busy motorway. But after nearly two days with no sign of survivors and the explosion site still considered dangerous for first responders, even the previously optimistic Humphreys County Sheriff Chris Davis said the time had come to switch to a recovery - rather than rescue - strategy. ""At some point in time, we have got to rip off the Band-Aid,"" Davis, who has held back tears at news conferences, said. ""We are dealing with remains."" Hickman County Sheriff Jason Craft told the BBC on Saturday night that rapid DNA analysis was still ongoing, but that after a search by 300 first responders, authorities had enough confidence in their assessment of the scene to notify families that their loved ones were likely deceased. No cause of the blast has yet been identified, and agents from the national Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) are investigating. It could take as long as a month for federal investigators to reach the main site of the explosion, ATF official Brice McCracken told the BBC. The volatile nature of the explosive materials has also hampered the emergency response, officials said, as controlled detonations to render the site safe are also expected in the coming days. Watch: Tennessee town comes together to confront tragedy Tiffany Story says her cousin was also among the victims, along with four other people that she knew, including someone she once used to babysit for. ""Everybody knows everybody here,"" an emotional Mrs Story told the BBC. ""With everybody being so close, it's very comforting to have family. That's what we are - whether [by] blood, not blood, this whole community is family."" ""There's probably never gonna be any answers"" to the tragedy, she said. Janie Brown said she also knew victims at the site. ""They were loved by their families and by the community,"" she said outside another prayer vigil at the Hurricane Chapel Free Will Baptist Church in nearby McEwen. ""It's just a sad, sad day,"" she said. Residents told the BBC the Accurate Energetic Systems (AES) company employed about 80 workers, and is one of the only private well-paying jobs around in these counties. For many here, the plant was known as a reliable first job for themselves or close friends. A recent job opening advertised a $19-per-hour salary for an entry-level manual labour job, more than double the state's minimum wage of $7.25. The factory has seen other difficulties, but none at such a scale as this. In 2014, an explosion at the company killed one person, and a 2019 workplace safety inspection led to relatively minor financial penalties, which the company settled, according to online records. Residents who spoke to the BBC had mostly positive feelings towards the company, and local police say they had no previous reports of unsafe working conditions. Hurricane Chapel Free Will Baptist Church Pastor Tim Ferris praised his congregation's response to the tragedy. ""One thing about a small community is that when something like this happens, they rally around each other, and they come close to be the hands and the feet of Jesus, to administer to these people, to care for them, provide for them. And that's a wonderful thing,"" he said.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cwy8y0rnw2eo,World (International),BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/ba74/live/b3b26eb0-a790-11f0-a1b6-8f14656a6062.jpg,2025-10-12T17:52:14.943000+00:00,dd69518b6afe54229e240a6b8ddcde838384df77

The US embassy in Mali said on Friday the fee had been introduced to reinforce Washington's ""commitment to protecting America's borders and safeguarding US national security"". Mali's foreign ministry said on Sunday the bond had been imposed unilaterally, and it had decided to ""establish an identical visa programme"" for US citizens. The visa policy shift comes despite moves to improve diplomatic relations between the two countries. In July, US officials visited Mali to discuss counterterrorism cooperation and economic partnerships, including potential access to Mali's gold and lithium reserves. Relations deteriorated after a coup in Mali in 2021 led to Gen Assimi Goïta sweeping to power. He pivoted the West African state towards Russia in a bid to stem a growing insurgency by jihadists. He expelled French troops, and brought in mercenaries from Russia's Wagner group, which is under Moscow's defence ministry. They have since been replaced by Africa Corps.

Herminie gained 52.7% of the vote, compared with Ramkalawan's 47.3%. In his victory speech, Herminie promised to lower the cost of living, revive public services, and unite the island nation, saying the result marked ""a new chapter for all Seychellois"". After losing his bid for a second term, Ramkalawan congratulated Herminie on his victory, saying he leaves ""a legacy that makes many presidents blush"". The election went to a run-off after neither candidate won an outright majority in the first round two weeks ago. A former parliamentary speaker, Herminie was charged with witchcraft in 2023 in what he said was a politically motivated attempt to thwart his presidential ambitions. The charges were dropped in 2024, paving the way for him to run for office. ""I will be the president of all Seychellois, and I will end divisions by ceasing preferences and giving everyone the opportunity to thrive,"" Herminie said in his victory speech. Ramkalawan is the latest incumbent to lose elections in Africa, with Malawi's President Lazarus Chakwera voted out of power last month amid growing discontent with the rising cost of living.

47931edd9c06,"We're grateful for what Trump is doing for peace, Nobel winner tells BBC",,"We're grateful for what Trump is doing for peace, Nobel winner tells BBC Norberto Paredes BBC Mundo and Alex Boyd Watch: 'A great honour for Venezuelan society' - Machado speaks to the BBC Nobel Peace Prize winner María Corina Machado has told the BBC she is grateful for what US President Donald Trump is doing ""around the world for peace"". Machado, Venezuela's opposition leader, was awarded the 2025 prize having long campaigned against the country's President Nicolás Maduro Moros, whose 12-year rule is viewed by many as illegitimate. She told BBC Mundo that during a congratulatory phone call with Trump she told him ""how grateful the Venezuelan people are for what he's doing, not only in the Americas, but around the world for peace, for freedom, for democracy"". Trump has made no secret about wanting to win the award himself, regularly speaking about the seven wars he claims to have ended . Nominations for the award closed in January, just as Trump's second term as president began. A White House official said on Friday the ""Nobel Committee proved they place politics over peace"". Machado said she was ""very glad"" to speak to the US president and was ""able to convey to him our appreciation"". The 58-year-old, forced to live in hiding for much of the past year, was hailed by the Nobel Committee as ""one of the most extraordinary examples of civilian courage in Latin America in recent times"". Nobel chairman Jørgen Watne Frydnes said she was recognised for ""her struggle to achieve a just and peaceful transition from dictatorship to democracy"". He added: ""Despite serious threats against her life, she has remained in the country, a choice that has inspired millions."" Machado was barred from running in last year's presidential elections, in which Maduro won a third six-year term in office. The elections were widely dismissed on the international stage as neither free nor fair, and sparked protests across the country. Even after she was barred from the polls, she managed to unite the notoriously divided opposition faction and succeeded in getting millions of Venezuelans behind the little-known candidate which replaced her on the ballot, Edmundo González. When the government-controlled National Electoral Council declared Maduro the winner - even though tallies from polling stations showed that González had won by a landslide - Machado continued to campaign from hiding as the Maduro government has repeatedly threatened her with arrest. Machado told BBC Mundo her award was ""like an injection"" for her political movement. ""It infuses energy, hope, strength on the Venezuelan people because we realise that we are not alone,"" she added. ""The democrats around the world share our struggle."" She said she thought Trump and the international community were already helping with the political situation in Venezuela. ""The regime in Venezuela is a criminal structure,"" Machado told the BBC. ""And as such, it sustains themselves on the criminal flows from their illicit activities. ""We need the international community to cut those flows that are not only used for corruption, but also for repression, violence and terror. ""So when you cut the inflows that come from drug trafficking, gold smuggling, arms smuggling, human trafficking, or the black market of oil, then the regime falls. ""And that's exactly what we're seeing, cracks that are getting deeper and deeper as we talk right now."" Earlier this month, US forces killed four people in an attack on a boat off the coast of Venezuela that was allegedly trafficking drugs.

Addressing the crowds, US special envoy Steve Witkoff said the hostages ""are coming home"" and praised Donald Trump for making a Gaza ceasefire and hostage return deal possible. In Gaza, Palestinian officials said about 500,000 people had returned to northern Gaza - which lies in ruins - in the past two days, following the withdrawal of Israeli troops. Meanwhile Egypt confirmed it would host a summit on Monday to finalise an agreement aimed at ending the war. More than 20 leaders including Trump would attend the summit in Sharm El-Sheikh, an Egyptian presidential spokesperson said. French President Emmanuel Macron and UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer are confirmed to be travelling to Egypt on Monday. Trump is expected to visit Israel on Monday before heading to Egypt. His daughter Ivanka and son-in-law Jared Kushner also addressed the Tel Aviv rally on Saturday. Three members of Qatar's top administrative body - the Amiri Diwan - died in a car crash near Sharm El-Sheikh, the Qatari embassy in Egypt said on Sunday. Qatar has been mediating in the Gaza crisis. Under the ceasefire and hostage release deal announced on Thursday, Hamas was given 72 hours - until 12:00 local time (09:00 GMT) on Monday - to release all the 48 hostages it is still holding after two years of war, 20 of whom are assumed to be alive. A top Hamas official, Osama Hamdan, told AFP news agency that ""according to the signed agreement, the prisoner exchange is set to begin on Monday morning as agreed, and there are no new developments on this matter"". He said Hamas militants on the ground had not yet notified the movement's leadership about the logistics of the handover. Aviv Havron, whose family members were murdered and others kidnapped in the 7 October 2023 attack by Hamas, told the BBC in Tel Aviv: ""It's so important for the community... that they come back. Without this, we can't restart our lives. ""My sisters and two brothers in law were murdered. Seven of my family members were kidnapped - my older sister was kidnapped, her daughter, her grandchildren. Four bodies of Be'eri [community] members are still in Gaza,."" Reuters Crowds at the Tel Aviv rally unfurled a banner praising Trump Shulamit and David Ginat, who also attended the Tel Aviv rally, told the BBC all the hostages must be saved. ""They're our brothers and sisters. We want to heal again. We want to stop the war, stop the pain and heal again,"" Shulamit said. Many in the crowd yelled ""Thank you, Trump!"" - but also booed when Witkoff mentioned Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Speaking just afterward, the couple said they were angry at him over the failure to prevent the 7 October attack, the war and the failure to bring the hostages home sooner. ""He wants to continue the war only because he wants to stay prime minister,"" David said. In Gaza, Hamas has called up thousands of fighters to reassert control over areas of Gaza recently vacated by Israeli troops, according to local sources. The Hamas mobilisation had been widely anticipated amid growing uncertainty about who will govern Gaza once the war ends and fears of internal violence. There have also been reports of armed clashes between Hamas and Gaza clans. Displaced Palestinians have continued to move north in Gaza in large numbers, in many cases arriving to find their homes destroyed. ""There is no house anymore. Everything is gone,"" lawyer Mosa Aldous said over the phone from Gaza City. Watch: Palestinians crowd around trucks to grab aid in Khan Younis Raja Salmi, 52, told AFP she reached Gaza City's Rimal neighbourhood to find her home also gone. ""I stood before it and cried. All those memories are now just dust,"" she said. Under the terms of the ceasefire and hostage release deal, the amount of aid entering Gaza is due to be scaled up but the World Food Programme (WFP) told the BBC that a surge of aid lorries had ""not yet"" entered Gaza, reporting only two to three lorries entering the territory daily. With full access, WFP, a UN agency, said it intended to restore its regular food distribution system, boosting aid through 145 distribution points across Gaza. Cogat, the Israeli military body overseeing the entry of aid into Gaza, said 500 trucks had entered on Thursday of which around 300 were distributed inside Gaza by the UN and other organisations. A recent report by the world's leading hunger monitor Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC), backed by the UN, estimated that 500,000 people in Gaza - a quarter of the territory's population - were suffering from famine. Israel has repeatedly denied that starvation is taking place in Gaza, and Netanyahu has said that where there is hunger, it is the fault of aid agencies and Hamas. About 1,200 people were killed and 251 taken hostage in the Hamas attack on 7 October 2023 on southern Israel. Israel responded by launching a military offensive that has killed more than 67,000 Palestinians in Gaza, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c75q5qng0rgo,World (International),BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/aa50/live/d652b260-a6e9-11f0-928c-71dbb8619e94.jpg,2025-10-12T04:37:28.145000+00:00,193ef781003246902ad20f56cff89c2221ab49af
da0f701a68df,Trump directs Pentagon to 'use all available funds' to pay troops during shutdown,,"Donald Trump is directing US Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth to pay military personnel despite the federal government shutdown. The president said on Saturday that Hegseth must make sure troops do not miss out on their regular paycheque, scheduled for Wednesday. The directive comes as other government employees have already had some pay withheld and others are being laid off. ""I will not allow the Democrats to hold our Military, and the entire Security of our Nation, HOSTAGE, with their dangerous Government Shutdown,"" Trump posted on his Truth Social platform. The Republican and Democratic parties blame each other for failing to agree on a spending plan to reopen the government. Trump's message asks Hegseth to ""use all available funds to get our Troops PAID"" on 15 October, when military personnel would see their pay withheld for the first time since the shutdown began on 1 October. Many US military employees are considered ""essential"", meaning they must still show up for duty without pay. Some 750,000 other federal employees - about 40% - have been furloughed, or sent home, also without pay. Furloughed employees are legally supposed to receive back-pay after a shutdown ends and they return to work, but the Trump administration has insinuated this might not happen. ""The Radical Left Democrats should OPEN THE GOVERNMENT, and then we can work together to address Healthcare, and many other things that they want to destroy,"" Trump posted on Saturday. Democrats have refused to vote for a Republican spending plan that would reopen the government after nearly 12 days shut down, saying any resolution must preserve expiring tax credits that reduce health insurance costs for millions of Americans and reverse Trump's cuts to Medicaid, the healthcare program for elderly and low-income people. Republicans accuse Democrats of unnecessarily bringing the government to a halt, and blame them for the knock-on effects caused by the federal work stoppage. Finding a way to pay for military salaries could help reduce some of the political risk  for congressional leaders if the shutdown drags on. In an effort to pressure Democrats, the Trump administration has also begun laying off thousands of government workers, an unprecedented move during a shutdown. ""The RIFs have begun,"" White House Office of Management Director Russell Vought announced in a post on X on Friday morning, referring to an acronym for ""reductions in force"". The administration disclosed later on Friday that seven agencies had started firing more than 4,000 people, making good on the president's repeated threats to use the shutdown to further his long-held goal of reducing the federal workforce. The reductions included dozens of employees at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), according to the BBC's US partner CBS news, citing sources familiar with the situation. The agency's entire Washington DC office was laid off, the sources told CBS, adding that among the laid-off employees were those working on the CDC's Mortality and Morbidity Weekly Report, the agency's Ebola response and immunisations. There were also reductions in the human resources department, they said. Andrew Nixon, a spokesperson for the Department of Health and Human Services, which oversees the CDC, told CBS that the let-go workers were not essential, and that ""HHS continues to close wasteful and duplicative entities, including those that are at odds with the Trump administration's Make America Healthy Again agenda"". Employees at the Treasury Department and in the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency in the Department of Homeland Security were also among those laid off on Friday, those agencies confirmed. The American Federation of Government Employees and AFL-CIO, two major unions representing federal workers, have filed a lawsuit in northern California, asking a judge to temporarily block the layoff orders. ""It is disgraceful that the Trump administration has used the government shutdown as an excuse to illegally fire thousands of workers who provide critical services to communities across the country,"" AFGE president Everett Kelley said. A spokesman from the White House budget office told the BBC on Saturday that the layoffs were just the beginning. ""These RIF numbers from the court filing are just a snapshot in time,"" he said. ""More RIFs are coming."" In a court filing opposing the unions' request for a temporary restraining order, the justice department revealed that agencies such as the Departments of Education, Housing and Urban Development, Commerce and Energy and the Environmental Protection Agency could also see staff cuts. The government lawyers said the labour unions had failed to establish that their members would be irreparably harmed by the layoffs, which is needed for the judge to grant the restraining order. But they said a restraining order would ""irreparably harm the government"". Are you a federal worker in the US?

e9c1834d9633,Hamas mobilises fighters in Gaza as fears of internal violence mount,,"Hamas has recalled about 7,000 members of its security forces to reassert control over areas of Gaza recently vacated by Israeli troops, according to local sources. The Palestinian group also appointed five new governors all with military backgrounds, some of whom previously commanded brigades in its armed wing. The mobilisation order was reportedly issued via phone calls and text messages which said the aim was to ""cleanse Gaza of outlaws and collaborators with Israel"" and told fighters to report within 24 hours. Reports from Gaza suggest armed Hamas units have already deployed across several districts, some wearing civilian clothes and others in the blue uniforms of the Gaza police. The Hamas media office denied it was deploying ""fighters in the streets"". Tensions rose sharply and quickly after two members of Hamas's elite forces were shot dead by gunmen from the powerful Dughmush clan in Gaza City's Sabra neighbourhood. One of them was the son of a senior commander in Hamas's armed wing, Imad Aqel, who now heads the group's military intelligence. Their bodies were left in the street, triggering anger and raising the prospect of a major armed response by Hamas. Hamas members later surrounded a large area where more than 300 Dughmush gunmen were believed to be holed up, armed with machine guns and improvised explosives. This morning Hamas killed one Dughmush clan member, and reportedly kidnapped another 30. Some of the clan's weapons were looted from Hamas depots during the war, while others had been in the clan's possession for years. The Hamas mobilisation had been widely anticipated amid growing uncertainty about who will govern Gaza once the war ends. This is a key issue that could complicate the start of the second phase of US President Donald Trump's peace plan, which calls for Hamas to disarm. A Hamas official abroad declined to comment directly on reports of the security deployment, but told the BBC: ""We cannot leave Gaza at the mercy of thieves and militias backed by the Israeli occupation. Our weapons are legitimate... to resist occupation, and they will remain as long as the occupation continues."" A retired security officer who served for years with the Palestinian Authority in Gaza said he feared the territory was sliding towards another round of internal bloodshed. ""Hamas hasn't changed. It still believes that weapons and violence are the only means to keep its movement alive,"" he told the BBC. ""Gaza is flooded with arms. Looters have stolen thousands of weapons and rounds of ammunition from Hamas stores during the war, and some groups have even received supplies from Israel. ""This is a perfect recipe for civil war: weapons, frustration, chaos, and a movement desperate to reassert control over a shattered and exhausted population."" Khalil Abu Shammala, a human rights expert who lives in Gaza, said it remained to be seen whether Hamas would accept handing over control on the ground or seek to obstruct the plan's implementation. ""There is undoubtedly widespread fear among many Gazans of potential internal fighting, given the many conditions that could fuel it,"" he said. He said Hamas had been forced to accept the peace plan by the severe pressure it was under. ""I believe its continued attempts to maintain influence by any means, including involvement in security affairs, could ultimately jeopardise the agreement and plunge Gaza's residents into even greater suffering,"" he said. These developments since the ceasefire earlier this week have sparked deep concern among Gazans already worn down by two years of a devastating conflict.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ce8482418plo,World (International),BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/28d5/live/6f84f470-a6ae-11f0-b55a-e7725355d83f.jpg,2025-10-11T14:44:59.836000+00:00,8845e626b85ca6e983ff67c3764e679dedaf6ee2

Sahil Majothi, 22, from the Indian state of Gujarat, went to Russia to study computer engineering two years ago. His mother claims he was falsely accused in a drug case last April. Mr Majothi joined the Russian army to avoid imprisonment over drug charges,  according to a video released by Ukraine's army on Tuesday. The Indian foreign ministry says it is investigating the case and has not received formal communication from Ukraine. The BBC has asked the Russian government for a response. In an interview with BBC Gujarati, Mr Majothi's mother Hasina Majothi said her son went to Russia in January 2024. He completed a three-month language course in St Petersburg before moving to Moscow for college, supporting himself part-time as a kitchenware courier. She alleges that in April 2024, someone slipped drugs into a parcel handed to Mr Majothi during his deliveries. ""The police caught him with it and charged him,"" Ms Hasina said. According to Ms Hasina, her son was detained, held for six months and later sentenced to seven years in prison. The family hired a private lawyer in Russia to defend him, but they had no idea when or how he was drafted into the military. ""I don't know how he ended up in Ukraine. I only found out through the viral video,"" Ms Hasina said. In the video released by the 63rd Mechanized Brigade of the Ukrainian army , Mr Majothi can be heard saying he was given a choice between joining the Russian army, with pay for his service, or serving jail time. He said he was told he would serve in the military for a year before being released. Mr Majothi claims that different people promised him varying amounts of money - from a hundred thousand to over a million roubles - but he never received any payment. He says he underwent 15 days of training in September 2024 and was sent to the battlefield a year later, on 30 September. The next day, on 1 October, Mr Majothi said he had an altercation with his commander, after which he separated from Russian soldiers. That was when he came across a Ukrainian dugout and asked them for help, he added. The BBC cannot independently verify the date or location of the video in which he makes these claims. Ukrainian army/Facebook Mr Majothi says he underwent 15 days of training before being sent to the battlefield a year later On Wednesday, after the video went viral, Gujarat's Anti-Terrorism Squad (ATS)  questioned Ms Hasina and her brother in Ahmedabad. Her relatives said she separated from her husband around her son's birth and supports her family as a seamstress while living with her maternal relatives. ATS officials confirmed Mr Majothi's arrest and subsequent detention in Russia. They said the family claimed to have had no contact with him since his arrest. At his former school in Morbi, teachers called Mr Majothi an ""average student"" but deeply motivated to fulfil his mother's dreams through education. They spoke on condition of anonymity. Local community leaders have also appealed to the government to intervene and secure his return. ""Many young men like him have been trapped and dragged into the war,"" said  Kasam Sumra. ""We appeal to the government to bring back Sahil and other young Indians who went abroad seeking work."" Mr Majothi's arrest comes amid rising concerns over Indians being recruited into the Russian military. Reports say over 150 Indians, some on student or visitor visas, have enlisted. At least 12 have died in the conflict and 16 remain missing. In September, Indian officials urged Moscow to release and repatriate 27 Indian nationals who had been recruited into the army. The Indian government has consistently advised its citizens against participating in the ongoing war in Ukraine. ""We once again strongly urge all Indian nationals to stay away from offers to serve in the Russian army, as they are fraught with danger and risk to life,"" a spokesperson from India's foreign ministry said last month.

aae9e75b0ed3,Drone strike in besieged Sudan city kills dozens,,"Dozens of people have been killed in a drone strike at a displacement shelter in el-Fasher, a besieged Sudanese city on the brink of collapse, activists said. The resistance committee for el-Fasher, made up of local citizens and activists, said the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) hit Dar al-Arqam camp, located within a university, with two drone strikes and eight artillery shells. The RSF has denied it carried out the strike. ""Children, women and the elderly were killed in cold blood, and many were completely burned,"" a statement from the group said. Eyewitnesses described scenes of panic as rescuers pulled bodies from the rubble. Sudan Doctors Network said 57 people were killed in the drone attack, including 17 children, and 17 were injured. Activists said at least 60 people had been killed. Hospitals already struggling under months of siege have been overwhelmed, with doctors treating the wounded on floors and in corridors. The RSF has surrounded el-Fasher for the last 17 months, in an attempt to take control of the Sudanese army's last stronghold in the Darfur region. The situation in el-Fasher has ""gone beyond disaster and genocide"", the resistance group said. Sudan has been ravished by conflict since 2023, after top commanders of the RSF and Sudanese army fell out and a vicious power struggle ensued - creating one of the worst humanitarian crises. The army controls most of the north and the east. El-Fasher is the last major urban centre in Darfur still held by the army and its allies. The RSF also controls almost all of Darfur and much of neighbouring Kordofan. If el-Fasher falls the RSF will control the entire Darfur region, where they hope to form an alternative government. In recent weeks, the RSF has intensified its assault on el-Fasher, leading experts to believe the city could soon fall unless the army receives immediate reinforcements. Research showed the RSF had finished building an earthen wall around el-Fasher, bolstering their siege and making it even harder for civilians to escape. The UN said there were 250,000 civilians trapped in el-Fasher, and warned that continued strikes on civilian areas may amount to war crimes. Hunger and disease has spread across the city as residents contend with constant bombardment and dwindling food and medical supplies. Two days ago, at least 13 people were killed after the RSF shelled one of the last remaining hospitals in el-Fasher. UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Volker Türk condemned the continued killing and injuring of civilians on Friday. ""I am appalled by the RSF's endless and wanton disregard for civilian life,"" he said. More than 150,000 people have died in the conflict across the country, and about 12 million have fled their homes.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3rvrn8req4o,World (International),BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/4f4e/live/d92cb460-a69c-11f0-a409-e197032d359e.jpg,2025-10-11T20:25:59.876000+00:00,35f73c41587e760cbfc2aaae485cbc7b90f63be3
9efd9c3ec3cc,Biden receiving radiation therapy for prostate cancer,,"Former US President Joe Biden is receiving radiation therapy as part of his treatment for prostate cancer, his spokesman has said. The spokesman also said that Biden, 82, was undergoing hormone treatment, without giving any further details. The radiation treatment was expected to span five weeks and marked a new point in his care, a source told NBC News. In May, Biden's office announced that he had been diagnosed with a more aggressive form of the disease , which had spread to his bones. The discovery came after the Democratic politician reported urinary symptoms that led doctors to find a small nodule on his prostate. The Biden office said at the time that ""he was diagnosed with prostate cancer, characterised by a Gleason score of 9 (Grade Group 5) with metastasis to the bone"". ""While this represents a more aggressive form of the disease, the cancer appears to be hormone-sensitive, which allows for effective management."" A Gleason score of nine meant his illness was classified as ""high-grade"" and the cancer cells could spread quickly, according to Cancer Research UK. A person close to Biden has said the former president is doing well and responding to treatment, the BBC's US news partner CBS reported, with another source telling the outlet that the radiation started ""a few weeks ago"" in Philadelphia. Biden left office in January as the oldest serving US president in history and questions about his health dogged his first term, leading him to end his run for re-election late in his campaign. His former Vice-President, Kamala Harris, ran instead as the Democrats' presidential candidate, losing to current US President Donald Trump. For many years, Biden has advocated for cancer research. In 2022, he and his wife Jill Biden relaunched the ""cancer moonshot"" initiative with the goal of mobilising research efforts to prevent more than four million cancer deaths by the year 2047. Biden lost his eldest son, Beau, to brain cancer in 2015. The former president and vice-president has also been treated twice for skin cancer, in 2023 and 2025. In recent months, Biden has largely retreated from the public eye. In May, he sat down for an interview with the BBC - his first since leaving the White House - where he admitted that the decision to step down from the 2024 race was ""difficult"". Prostate cancer is the second most common cancer affecting men, behind skin cancer, according to the American Cancer Society.

Around 16 male reporters were selected to attend a forum on Friday with Foreign Minister Amir Khan Muttaqi at the Afghan embassy. Journalists observed women and foreign media being turned away. India's Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) said it ""had no involvement in the press interaction"" at the Afghan embassy. A source in the Taliban government admitted women had not been invited to attend. They told the BBC ""female journalists were excluded due to lack of proper coordination and will be invited to next conference if held in Delhi"". Opposition leader Rahul Gandhi said by allowing the event to go ahead, India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi was ""telling every woman in India that you are too weak to stand up for them"". The Editors Guild of India strongly condemned the exclusion and said: ""Whether or not the MEA coordinated the event, it is deeply troubling that such a discriminatory exclusion was allowed to proceed without objection."" It called for India's government to ""publicly reaffirm that press access at diplomatic events held in India must respect gender equity"". Muttaqi is in India for a week of high-level talks with the government. On Friday, he met with Foreign Minister S Jaishankar who announced that India would re-open its embassy in Kabul.

Following the men-only press event, Rahul Gandhi said on social media: ""In our country, women have the right to equal participation in every space."" Indian politician Priyanka Gandhi Vadra asked Modi to clarify his position on ""the removal of female journalists"" from the gathering. She asked how ""this insult to some of India's most competent women"" had been allowed in ""a country whose women are its backbone and its pride"". Others expressed shock and said the men who went to the event should have walked out in solidarity with their female colleagues. ""Why did our emasculated spineless male journos remain in room?"" wrote politician Mahua Moitra on social media.

389f3c0aa25c,Hamas presses Israel to free prominent prisoners as part of Gaza deal,,"Hamas is pressing Israel to include prominent Palestinians in a prisoner-release list -  part of a ceasefire deal that will also see hostages returned from Gaza. Hamas's insistence comes after the Israeli justice ministry published the names of 250 prisoners to be freed, but excluded seven high-profile prisoners, including Marwan Barghouti and Ahmad Saadat. The men, who are serving sentences after being convicted of involvement in separate deadly attacks in Israel, have long been seen by Palestinians as symbols of resistance. Twenty Israeli hostages are expected to be released before 12:00 (09:00 GMT) on Monday as part of the deal proposed by US President Donald Trump. A senior Palestinian official familiar with the talks told the BBC that US envoy Steve Witkoff had promised to raise the exclusion of the Palestinian prisoners with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, but Israel has firmly refused to include them. It is not clear whether this could be a sticking point, or impact the timeline for the release of hostages from the Gaza Strip and Palestinian prisoners held in Israeli jails. The releases are due to take place in the first phase of Trump's ceasefire and hostage return deal, approved this week to end the two-year war in Gaza. It is unclear how the hostages will be released this time - on previous occasions Hamas paraded them in public, infuriating Israel and many of its Western allies. The bodies of deceased hostages will also be returned. It is thought that at least 26 hostages are deceased, with the fate of two others unknown. Israel will also release about 250 Palestinian prisoners serving life sentences in Israeli jails, and another 1,700 Palestinians from Gaza who have been detained. Hamas had submitted a list of prisoners it wanted released that included Barghouti and Saadat. Barghouti is serving five life sentences plus 40 years after being convicted in 2004 of planning attacks that led to five civilians being killed. Opinion polls have consistently indicated that he remains the most popular Palestinian leader, and that Palestinians would vote for him in a presidential election ahead of the current Palestinian Authority (PA) President Mahmoud Abbas or Hamas leaders. Barghouti remains a senior figure in the Fatah faction that dominates the PA, which governs parts of the occupied West Bank not under Israeli control. Saadat, leader of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP), was sentenced to 30 years after being convicted in 2008 of heading an ""illegal terrorist organisation"" and involvement in attacks, including the assassination of an Israeli minister in 2001. Among the 250 prisoners set to be released is Iyad Abu al-Rub, an Islamic Jihad commander convicted of orchestrating suicide bombings in Israel that killed 13 people in the early 2000s. According to the Israeli justice ministry, he will be released either to Gaza or deported abroad. The BBC understands that Hamas is also pushing for some possible additional prisoner releases. These relate to Palestinian prisoners who were released years ago as part of an exchange for the hostage Gilad Shalit - and then were rearrested after 7 October. Hamas argues that since they were part of a previous hostage exchange, they should not be included in the 250 figure. In Israel, hospitals are preparing for the release of hostages as families await their return. The first phase of the Israel-Hamas deal saw a ceasefire take effect on Friday and Israeli forces partially withdraw from parts of Gaza. Hundreds of aid trucks a day are now expected to enter. The next phases are still being negotiated. Hundreds of thousands of Palestinians have returned from southern Gaza to Gaza City, weeks after fleeing the Israeli offensive that destroyed much of the city. Gaza's Hamas-run civil defence agency has said it is conducting recovery operations and pulling bodies from the rubble, with Palestinians still missing across the territory. Israel's war on Gaza was triggered by the Hamas-led attacks on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 taken hostage. Since then, 67,682 Palestinians have been killed in Israel's military offensive in Gaza, the Hamas-run health ministry says.

It will also spend $4.5bn buying 16 more F-35 fighter jets from the US, bringing its total fleet of such advanced planes to 43. ""With this... agreement we significantly strengthen the capabilities of the Danish Armed Forces in the region,"" Denmark's Defence Minister Troels Lund Poulsen said in a statement on Friday. The Arctic is at a critical crossroads between North America, Russia and the rest of Europe. The statement by the Danish defence ministry says the purpose of its military is security, and if necessary, defence in the Nato security alliance. ""The task of the Armed Forces is to ensure security throughout the Kingdom - and, if necessary, to defend Greenland, the Faroe Islands and Denmark within the framework of Nato in all domains,"" the Chief of Defence, Michael Hyldgaard, told Danish public broadcaster DR, without saying who the potential adversaries were. Denmark worked on the new defence package with the governments of Greenland and the Faroe Islands. It will buy two new Arctic ships, maritime patrol planes, drones and early warning radar. Crucially, a new Arctic command headquarters will be set up in the Greenlandic capital, Nuuk, alongside a new military unit under Joint Arctic Command in Greenland. In addition, an undersea cable connecting Greenland and Denmark will be funded. Greenland in particular is strategically located between North America and Russia. Though the island has wide-ranging autonomy, it remains part of the kingdom of Denmark. In recent years, there has been increased interest in the vast island's natural resources, including mining for rare earth minerals, uranium and iron. Greenland lies on the shortest route from North America to Europe, making it strategically important for the US. The island has been home to a US radar base since the Cold War and also hosts a large American space facility. US President Donald Trump has suggested the island is crucial to military efforts to track Chinese and Russian ships, which he said are ""all over the place"". Trump has repeatedly expressed his desire to acquire Greenland, saying the island was ""critical"" for national and economic security.

Four of the injured were airlifted to hospital, Lee added. No suspects were in custody, but a police manhunt was under way. Leland was busier than usual on Friday with the local high school scheduled to play a football game to mark homecoming, an annual US tradition, usually in autumn, when former students are welcomed back to celebrate school spirit and community. The mayor said that the shooting did not take place on the Leland High School campus.

The desert's extreme aridity makes it one of the clearest places on Earth to view the night sky and is famous for being home to the largest radio telescope in the world. But the usually barren landscape has been transformed by a carpet of colourful wildflowers, which have been brought to life by significant rainfall during the southern hemisphere's winter months. This is thought to be an event that only occurs every few years, when above average rainfall soaks the desert floor, causing dormant seeds to spring to life. The Atacama desert typically receives less than 15mm of rain every year. But the area had more than 12mm of rain during August alone - most of which fell on just one day. The desert even saw a rare blanket of snow back in June. AFP via Getty Images/Jose Torres This magnificent bloom is made up of more than 200 different species of wildflowers, some of which do not grow anywhere else in the world. It typically occurs between the end of August and November. Although thought of as rare, this phenomenon also occurred in 2024, following heavy rainfall in the area.

She made the announcement on Friday, saying that after an ""open channel of communication"" with Putin, Ukranian children displaced in the war had been reunited with families. The First Lady's ""peace letter"" was hand delivered to Putin during his Alaska visit in August. President Donald Trump shared parts of the letter on social media. In it, the first lady pleads with Putin to protect children, writing that doing so ""will do more than serve Russia alone"" and ""will serve humanity itself"". ""Eight children have been rejoined with their families during the past 24 hours,"" Mrs Trump said, flanked by American flags behind a podium in the White House. ""Each child has lived in turmoil because of the war in Ukraine."" Of the eight children, the First Lady said three separated from their families were displaced to Russia because of front-line fighting. Another young girl displaced by the conflict has now been returned from Ukraine to Russia, Mrs Trump says. The children's reunification with their families was facilitated by both Ukraine and Russia, the First Lady said, adding that she was given a detailed report with photographs and the ""identities and circumstances"" of each child. The US government ""confirmed the facts"", she said. Mrs Trump said she has ""learned a lot about this matter"" since her letter was first handed to Putin. She said he responded in writing. In her letter, the First Lady wrote: ""Every child shares the same quiet dreams in their heart... They dream of love, possibility, and safety from danger."" The announcement marks a positive development in her advocacy for children from the White House, which began during President Trump's first term. She launched the BE BEST initiative in January 2021, which the White House describes as an awareness campaign focused around the well-being of children globally. Earlier this year, the First Lady led an initiative for Congress to pass a bill banning revenge porn called the Take It Down Act. After the bill was signed, she said it was ""a powerful statement that we stand united in protecting the dignity, privacy, and safety of our children"". According to the Ukrainian government, at least 19,500 Ukrainian children have been deported and forcibly displaced from their homes to Russia and Russian-occupied territories since February 2022.

""It is a privilege,"" says the head of nursing. ""These are the moments, when I'm 70 or 80, these are the two or three moments I will remember. They symbolise so many values – as a nurse, as a mother, as a woman, as an Israeli."" Twenty living hostages are due to be released under the terms of the agreement between Israel and Hamas. Several of them will be brought to this hospital. It will be the third time that the hostages' unit has gone operational. The BBC visited the unit on Saturday, when the medical team learned the identities of the hostages they would be treating. ""There is no such field as captivity medicine, and we are inventing it,"" said Dr Steinman told the BBC. The staff have learned two big lessons from the two previous hostage releases in November 2023 and January this year, she says. The first is to be ""a medical detective"", to try to understand what happened in those long days and nights of captivity. With earlier, often emaciated, shackled, beaten hostages, ""they had things in their blood exams, in their enzymes, that we couldn't understand"". They also have learned that symptoms may not present for days or weeks. ""Captivity does things to your body that your body remembers. You see all these layers. It takes time to see what happened to their bodies, to their souls,"" she said. ""We're still taking care of the hostages who came back in January and February, and every week we discover new things."" Reuters It's the third time the hospital's unit has received freed hostages after previous release deals in late 2023 and January this year (file photo) The other lesson is to take time. There are a huge number of professionals from different disciplines: nutritionists, social workers, mental health specialists, along with the full panoply of medical staff. But there is also a ""do not disturb"" card on the door of each released hostage's private room. The echoes of a hotel are deliberate, as are the care packages and soft furnishings and soft lighting to go with the hospital bed and monitors. There is an extra single bed made up for those hostages who don't want to be left alone overnight, so that a partner or relative can sleep alongside them. Their closest family will also have their own bedroom directly across the corridor from the hostage's. ""You know medical people are task-oriented. There's a schedule,"" says Dr Steinman. ""Here you have to give them much more space. You have to decide what's urgent, and what can wait another two days. You have to be humble and flexible, without letting go of your medical responsibility."" Among those responsibilities is determining what the hostages, some of whom may have lost more than half their body weight in captivity, can eat, and how quickly. Their physical recuperation is only part of the story. Karina Shwartz is director of social work at the Rabin Medical Center.  She is another key member of the team, with a responsibility not just for the hostages but for their closest relatives. They need to learn their own delicate calibration of family dynamics – of when to speak and when not to, she says. ""The most important thing is what we're not saying,"" she says. ""Because if we're sitting in the room, and someone tells us something very difficult about how they almost died in captivity, and we stay silent: it's a very loud silence."" But at the same time, there is a need to hold back. ""We can't speak about two years in a week. The hostages need space and time. They also need quiet. We have to listen. To listen to their story."" Karina Shwartz and her team will prepare the hostages to leave the hospital and re-enter the outside world The staff in the hostage returns unit emphasise that their job does not end when the hostages return home. Medical and psychological rehabilitation will continue and the hostages must also be prepared, says Ms Shwartz, for the moment ""when the real world comes in"". The message she and her team try to drill into the hostages and their families is that everyone will want to see them. For two years they have been public figures. ""Everyone will want to be friends.  We tell them: it's okay to say no. It's safe to say no."" For now, the nervous anticipation among the staff is palpable. ""You should see my WhatsApp messages,"" says Dr Steinman, a very Israeli director of nursing with her nose piercing and multiple tattoos. Pretty much every single one of her 1,700 nurses across the medical complex has, she says, volunteered to pull extra shifts on the unit. ""You gain hope again,"" she says. ""Working here you realise that life and human beings are good. You realise the strength of the human spirit."" And yet, the greatest pleasure, she says, will be for that work to be over. ""This is the third time we're opening the unit.  To know that this is the last time: that when we close this place and say the mission is done.  Then we will know that the nightmare is over.""",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4gvg8jx7gmo,World (International),BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/167b/live/252b1e00-a6cb-11f0-bf22-9df87c17cee5.jpg,2025-10-11T18:34:31.152000+00:00,fb4705a4f8b4164d19e05117543bb9c892e62118
a07a73683fb9,How the autumn climbing season turned deadly in the Himalayas,,"How the autumn climbing season turned deadly in the Himalayas Navin Singh Khadka Environment correspondent, BBC World Service Getty Images The autumn hiking season is increasingly seeing extreme weather Clear skies, calm winds and a panoramic view of Himalayan peaks draped in snow - that is the autumn hikers on Mount Everest have come to love. But that seems to be changing. The monsoon now stretches into autumn, the traditional season for mountain tourism, meteorologists say, making weather more unpredictable. For the past decade, they have recorded at least one episode of extreme rainfall almost every year during the tail end of this longer monsoon - and in the mountains it is becoming quite dangerous. Last weekend, a shock blizzard stranded hundreds of tourists near the eastern face of Everest for days in freezing temperatures at an altitude of more than 4,900m (16,000ft). Nearly 600 trekkers were guided to safety by the end of Tuesday, Chinese state media said. One person had died from hypothermia and altitude sickness, but the others were reportedly in good condition. This was on the Tibetan side but something similar had unfolded on the Nepal side, where a South Korean mountaineer died on Mera Peak. The world found out much later because communication lines were hit by torrential rains and heavy snowfall. Officials estimate that landslides and flash floods in the country have killed around 60 people over the past week. This is highly unusual for October ""when we expect the skies to remain clear,"" said Riten Jangbu Sherpa, a mountain guide, adding that trekkers have been increasingly caught in unexpected extreme weather in recent years. Given this is the favoured season, frequent storms like this have ""hampered our trekking and mountaineering business,"" he added. The monsoon season in northern India and Nepal usually lasts from June to mid- September, but not anymore. ""Our data shows that most of the years in the past decade have had monsoons lasting until the second week of October, which is definitely a change,"" said Archana Shrestha, deputy director general at Nepal's department of hydrology and meteorology. More worrying is the heavy rain and snow the tail end of the season brings, like it did this time on 4 and 5 October - Ms Shreshtha described the pattern as ""damaging precipitation in a short span of time"". High in the Himalayas, such extreme weather means blizzards and snowstorms, which is a huge risk for trekking, mountaineering and tourism. Reuters A snowstorm this month trapped hundreds of tourists near the eastern face of Everest That's what happened last weekend when the weather changed quite suddenly - the winds began howling, temperatures plummeted and visibility dropped drastically. The road that had comfortably brought the hikers to what should have been a stunning pitstop was now buried in snow and impossible to traverse. On Cho Oyu, another mountain which stands between China and Nepal, a team of climbers on the 8,201m peak retreated temporarily as snow fell unabated. ""Now they are back after the heavy snowfall ended,"" said expedition operator Mingma Sherpa, whose team has six members. But for hikers trapped near the eastern face of Everest, the return was much dicier. Some told the BBC they battled hypothermia despite being dressed warmly while trudging along deep snow. Others said they didn't sleep for fear of being buried in the snow, which was falling so heavily that they spent most of their time clearing it. It could have ended tragically had it not been for a well-coordinated rescue, with yaks and horses deployed to clear the snow. Still, one trekker, who had hiked up these mountains more than a dozen times, told the BBC he had ""never experienced weather like this"". One big driver is the higher amount of moisture in the air because of how the world has been warming, scientists say. That has led to torrential rains over a short span of time, often after a prolonged dry spell – unlike in the past when monsoon showers were spread evenly over four months. ""The weather at this time of the year has been changing every year in recent years, we can't promise our clients anything,"" said Passang, a travel agent in the Tibetan capital Lhasa. ""September, October used to be peak season with pleasant weather but these days we see extreme weather all of a sudden and the temperature drops so quickly."" Getty Images Landslides and flash floods in Nepal over the past week have killed dozens A turbocharged monsoon Weather experts say the monsoons in South Asia at times appear to have become stronger because they are increasingly coming into contact with another weather system, the westerly disturbance. This is a low pressure system that originates in the Mediterranean region and travels east - it carries cold air that brings rains and occasionally snow to northern India, Pakistan and Nepal. But when it meets air that is warmer and wetter - which is what happens during the monsoon - the result can lead to more extreme weather. Put simply, westerly disturbances can ""effectively turbocharge the monsoon"", said Akshay Deoras, a weather scientist at the University of Reading in the UK. The reason this is happening more often is that these weather systems have traditionally been a winter phenomenon, arriving between December and March in  northern India and the Himalayas. But now, meteorologists say, they are frequently arriving earlier, during monsoon and autumn. The deluge of rain and snow in eastern Nepal, where Everest is located, in early October was also because of the westerly disturbance, officials at Nepal's meteorology department said. They added that the westerly disturbance had fuelled a low-pressure system (a part of the tail end of monsoon) from the Bay of Bengal, pushing the clouds eastwards when in fact they should have moved west. Scientists have also found that in a warming world, the growing interaction between westerly disturbances and monsoons is producing another unusual result. The warmer air is pushing the clouds higher, which means these weather systems are now able to cross the Himalayas and reach Tibet and other areas that did not see so much rain before. A study published in the journal Nature in June notes that ""the warming climate and the interaction between the westerly and the Indian monsoon are making the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau change into a warming and wetting climate"". The Tibetan plateau has always been home to a dry climate. And scientists say a warm, wet Tibet could mean unstable weather and frequent snowstorms and blizzards. ""What's changed is the reliability of patterns; we can't assume that conditions will behave the same from season to season,"" said Logan Talbott, chief guide with Alpenglow Expeditions that brings climbers to the Tibet side of Everest each year. ""That means flexible scheduling, real-time decision-making, and experienced leadership [in the Himalayas] have become even more important.""",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx2jwgnwmezo,World (International),BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/99f9/live/db61de90-a5c5-11f0-92db-77261a15b9d2.jpg,2025-10-11T22:17:35.335000+00:00,7ac0e47f9b543151ee2303f634fb7161d7ec32ba
eb7cb47f2d9c,South Africa debates changing name of world-famous Kruger park,,"South Africa debates changing name of world-famous Kruger park Khanyisile Ngcobo Johannesburg Corbis via Getty Images A bust of Paul Kruger stands at one of the gates to the national park that bears his name South Africa's world-famous Kruger National Park could become known by a new name if some local politicians have their way. The vast wildlife sanctuary, called the Sabi Game Reserve at the time, was re-christened in 1926 to honour Paul Kruger. He was president in the late 19th Century of what was known as the South African Republic, which forms part of what is now the east of South Africa. For Afrikaners, descendants of 17th Century European settlers, Kruger is revered as a hero who led the resistance against British colonialism. But for the majority of South Africans, he is viewed as a relic of the country's racist past, as he was one of those responsible for driving black Africans off their land and excluding them from having a say in running the republic. Many South African cities, towns, roads and other major infrastructure have been given new names since the end of the legalised system of racial discrimination, known as apartheid, and the beginning of the democratic era in 1994. Though sometimes controversial, the decisions have been justified as a way to break with what went before – both the apartheid and colonial era. But the proposed Kruger name-change does not just touch on history, it also could have a bearing on the country's fragile economy. AFP via Getty Images Tourists go to the park in their hundreds of thousands every year to view the wildlife on offer The national park, home to elephants, lions, hippos, leopards and many other animals, attracts almost a million visitors a year, and is a jewel in the crown of South Africa's tourism industry. Some argue that changing Kruger's name could threaten that. Part of the park is in Mpumalanga province and in September, as the country celebrated Heritage Month, representatives from the opposition Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) put forward a proposal in the region's legislature to change Kruger's name. ""How do we celebrate our heritage as South Africans when we still have our beautiful national parks named after the architect of apartheid Paul Kruger,"" EFF representative Rhulani Qhibi was quoted as saying in a stirring speech. While not historically accurate, as apartheid in its legal form was introduced decades after Kruger's death, the rhetoric reflects the way he is viewed by some. The EFF also proposed the renaming of other key landmarks in the province, including the Kruger Mpumalanga International airport. But in their haste to remove Kruger's association with the park, the EFF, whose national leader is the firebrand MP Julius Malema , put forward another problematic name: Skukuza. Skukuza, which means ""he who sweeps clean"" in the Tsonga language, was the nickname given to the park's first warden, James Stevenson-Hamilton, who was known for driving out poachers and black communities that lived in the park in its early days, among other things. The EFF leader in Mpumalanga, Collen Sedibe, was quoted in South African publication Sunday World as admitting the party's blunder. ""We are still engaging with the land claimants at Kruger National Park and the people who were staying there because they said Skukuza is not the right name. He was the man who kicked them out of the park,"" Sedibe said. Gallo Images via Getty Images The Paul Kruger statue in Pretoria has sometimes attracted the ire of protesters - it was daubed with red paint in 2020 Afrikaner lobby group AfriForum condemned the EFF's proposal as ""cheap politics and proof that political power-hunger in the province outweighs informed or responsible decision-making"". The group vowed to mount legal challenges to any attempts to rename the park without due process and blasted the EFF for criticising its namesake. ""The Kruger National Park was created thanks to Kruger's vision [and] to ignore Kruger's contribution to the establishment of the country's most important national park... is opportunistic and blatantly spreading lies,"" AfriForum's Marais de Vaal said in reaction to the news. The motion to change the name was adopted by the provincial legislature after receiving support from its largest parties, the African National Congress (ANC), which is in power nationally, and uMkhonto weSizwe. Despite it not being legally binding, as there is a national process that any name change needs to go through, detractors have warned that if approved it could damage the tourism sector, which contributes almost 9% to the country's economy. It could have ""severe consequences... it might even dilute the international recognition of this park and South Africa as a tourism destination that we've built over so many years"", tourism expert Prof Elmarie Slabbert told the BBC. There would also be the cost of having to rebrand the park. The academic, a research director at the North West University's school of tourism management, did acknowledge ""that we need to honour indigenous heritage"". ""But the effect on the economy is going to be so significant that we need to decide where do we spend our money. We've got such a high unemployment rate at this point in time that I believe that is where the money should go."" More than 30% of the working-age population are unemployed - ranked by the World Bank as one of the worst jobless rates of any nation – and youth unemployment is even higher. But economics is not the only basis on which name-change decisions have been made. The need to address the inequities of the country's past has been seen as vital. Getty Images The Indian Ocean city of Gqeberha was known as Port Elizabeth until 2021 For instance, the name of former Prime Minister Hendrik Verwoerd, a key figure in implementing apartheid, has been removed from many places. Other changes include the city of Port Elizabeth. Named after the wife of a 19th Century British official, it is now called Gqeberha, the Xhosa word for the river that runs through it. King William's Town, after William IV, is now Qonce, also referring to a river. Johannesburg's international airport, once known as Jan Smuts – honouring a former prime minister – is now called OR Tambo, after the anti-apartheid leader and former president of the ANC. Some cities, like the capital, Pretoria, have kept their monikers but the local government areas under which they come have been renamed. Plenty of other renaming ideas have been floated, including changing the name of the Eastern Cape seaside town of Port Alfred, which commemorates Queen Victoria's second son. Some have even suggested changing the country's name to Azania. Many of these proposals have divided public opinion, and to ensure that changes are not just made on a whim there is an extensive legal process that needs to be completed. It is managed by the South African Geographical Names Council (SAGNC) and begins with an application either by individuals, communities or institutions to the body's provincial branch. The proposal is discussed and could lead to a public consultation. Once this has been concluded, the name-change plan is sent to the national office. If it is thought to satisfy ""all the requirements"", a recommendation will then be made to the sports, arts and culture minister for a final decision, SAGNC chairperson Dr Nkadimeng Mahosi told the BBC. ""What is happening here [in Mpumalanga's legislature], does not go according to what the national act says… [and] is political point-scoring,"" he said. As a national landmark, and the fact that different government departments will need to have a say, Kruger is a unique case, Dr Mahosi added. There are then several bureaucratic hurdles that need to be negotiated before the name Kruger ever disappears from tourism brochures. But the debate has revealed the sensitivities that continue to exist around how to deal with the country's past and the legacy of those who used to govern it.

5711ee3f748d,KPop Demon Hunters directors on Oscar chances and a possible sequel,,"KPop Demon Hunters directors on Oscar chances and a possible sequel Colin Paterson Entertainment correspondent Netflix Zoey, Rumi and Mira are Huntr/x - the Kpop trio who also try and save the world from evil Maggie Kang, the creator and co-director of Kpop Demon Hunters, has said she is ""excited for the potential for more stories"" involving animated girl group Huntr/x. Speaking to the BBC during a visit to Europe, Kang explained that while there was ""nothing official we can talk about"", she and co-director Chris Appelhans believe ""there's definitely more we can do with these characters in this world"". ""And whatever it will be, it will be a story that deserves to be a sequel, and it will be something that we want to see,"" she added. Kpop Demon Hunters has become a cultural phenomenon this year, overtaking Squid Game as the most watched title in Netflix history, with more than 325m views. Getty The directors of Kpop Demon Hunters, Chris Appelhans and Maggie Kang The animated film tells the story of a hugely successful female Kpop trio, who play enormous concerts at the same time as trying to save the world from evil forces. They end up locked in battle against a boy band called Saja Boys, who are made up of demons. The film has broken record after record. A sing-a-long version released in cinemas in August became the first ever Netflix film to top the US box office. Its music also topped the US singles and albums charts, becoming the first soundtrack in history to have four songs simultaneously in the US top 10, something not even Saturday Night Fever could achieve. The film's anthem Golden, sung by Huntr/x, has spent eight weeks at number one, tying Sugar Sugar by The Archies for the most time at the top of the charts by an animated act. Could the Oscars go Golden? There is now a real belief that Kpop Demon Hunters could be set to slay the Oscars. Critics have loved the film, which holds a score of 95% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes , the online review aggregator. The influential Gold Derby predictions website now has it as the favourite for the best animated film , ahead of Zootopia 2 and Elio. ""The title alone is obviously Oscar bait,"" laughs Chris Appelhans, the American who is the other half of the directing duo. ""We tried to do something new and it was really hard and I think we're really proud of how it came out. But if people are going to reward that, that would be awesome."" The other category where the film should be a strong challenger is best original song, where the rules state that any film can only enter three numbers. Netflix Songs by both Hunter/x and the Saja Boys, the boyband populated by demons, could be nominated at the Oscars Netflix have already stated that breakout hit Golden will be included for Academy consideration, but what about the other two slots? ""I think Your Idol is such a banger,""  says Kang about song the Saja Boys sing while feeding the souls of their audience to the evil overlord Gwi-Ma. ""We're so proud of the song, but also the sequence. We cheered, we were so proud of it."" Appelhans, however, is team Huntr/x, opting for What it Sounds Like. ""The finale was such a technical challenge, both in songwriting and storytelling,"" he explains. ""To make a song that was the climax of your movie, with a lot of moving parts, but was also an actual cathartic song."" Kang concurs: ""It's the one song that every time I hear it, I just cry. It's very emotional."" ""No room for Soda Pop?"" I question about the Saja Boys earworm. ""Maybe we could get four?"" laughs Kang. ""We'll just submit then all,"" joins in Appelhans. Summer of success Appelhans can pin point the exact moment back in June when he realised they had a hit on their hands. ""It's literally 2am the night after the film came out. I'm on TikTok and in the comments section they are perfectly articulating Rumi's emotional journey."" He was overjoyed that the fans were already engaging with film's main protagonist, on a deep level. Kang, who was born in South Korea and moved to Canada aged five, places the breakthrough moment as slightly later. ""We were able to connect with our core audience, which is the KPop audience and the animation fans and that demographic took to our film very quickly. ""But it was the third week when the trajectory of the graph of viewership really changed. We were like, 'Woah. That was weird.' ""And we could see through our social media all the different pockets of demographic that were connecting to it."" Kang believes that the fans have been crucial in film's all conquering rise: ""They are an age group that loves to make content. And it was kind of like free advertising. They were just spreading the word of this movie everywhere. I think that helped it develop these long legs."" The film's success continues to grow. Four months after its release, it was still the most watched film in 19 countries last week, including the UK and US. The Kpop stars Rei Ami, Audrey Nuna, and EJAY, who provide the singing voices for Huntr/x, have appeared on both Saturday Night Live (in a skit with Bad Bunny) and gave their first ever live performance of Golden on Jimmy Fallon's US chat show . ""We were so bummed that we weren't able to be there at Fallon,"" says Kang in a rare moment of non-total positivity. ""We were asleep in Paris. Just to see him speaking to our girls was so weird. It now feels more real than ever. I'm just so proud of them. Todd Owyoung/NBC via Getty Images (L-R) Rei Ami, Audrey Nuna, and EJAY, who provide the singing voices of Huntr/x, were presented with a platinum disc by Fallon One thing the pair would like to clear up is that they do not believe that their film should be classified as anime. ""I don't think we are big enough anime fans to be that inspired from it,"" explains Kang. ""The anime we like are very old school, like Cowboy Bebop and Sailor Moon,"" referencing two Japanese TV shows which originated in the 90s. Appelhans agrees: ""I think it was a flavour. I think we were influenced by a lot of Korean film makers and k-dramas. It was part of a wide spectrum of tones that we wanted to hit, but not the dominant one."" No live action adaptation They are also quick to rule out rumours of a Kpop Demon Hunters live-action adaptation. Kang wants to kick that idea into the underworld: ""There's so many elements of the tone and the comedy that are so suited for animation,"" she says. ""It's really hard to imagine these characters in a live action world. It would feel too grounded. So totally it wouldn't work for me."" For Appelhans, it is an ill-conceived idea: ""One of the great things about animation is that you make these composites of impossibly great attributes. Rumi can be this goofy comedian and then singing and doing a spinning back-kick a second later and then freefalling through the sky. ""The joy of animation is how far you can push and elevate what's possible. I remember they adapted a lot of different animes and often times, it just feels a little stilted."" Ricky Midlesworth/ Netflix The speaking voices of Huntr/x: Ji-young Yoo (Zoey), Arden Cho (Rumi) and May Hong (Rumi) No matter what happens this awards season, Kang says their expectations for the film have already been more than surpassed. She surmises that the aim was ""to connect people and bring them to Kpop"". ""Just seeing people bond over this movie has been so wonderful,"" she reflects. ""So all the awards would be great, but I think we feel really incredible about what the movie has done already. So it feels like we've kind of won in a way.""",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c8rvzmyyzmpo,World (International),BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/5227/live/940c9bf0-a5ea-11f0-928c-71dbb8619e94.jpg,2025-10-11T23:04:33.226000+00:00,d6d3596d829dd145be3d399578b4390988e81ae2
e1f082bc59f6,Thirty belugas in Canada face being euthanised. Can they be saved?,,"Thirty belugas in Canada face being euthanised. Can they be saved? Watch: Drone video shows beluga whales at Marineland in Ontario For decades, Marineland was a destination for Canadian children and their parents who wanted an up-close look at ocean-life near Niagara Falls. But behind the aquatic-themed roller coasters and dolphin performances was a dark history of documented mistreatment of animals and lingering financial problems. Ontario's Animal Welfare Services has conducted multiple investigations over the past several years, visiting the park more than 200 times since 2020, according to CBC News. Amid financial struggles, the park has been trying to get permission to sell 30 beluga whales to China. When their permits were denied, the park said it may have to euthanise the whales. Now advocates, experts and officials are looking for ways to save the whales - though few agree on one solution, and some say Marineland's threats to kill its whales are all talk. Getty Images The massive aquatic park, started by John and Marie Holer in 1961, sits on over 1,000 acres (400 ha) of prime Ontario real estate. But what was once a beloved attraction with a catchy commercial jingle has faced growing scrutiny over its care for animals, which also included land animals like bears and elk. In 2019, Canada passed a bill making it illegal to hold a whale, dolphin or porpoise captive. The legislation created protections for any future animals, but not for the animals already in captivity, leaving little room for federal government involvement with the whales at Marineland. Criticisms of the park date back several years, and in 2020 Animal Welfare Services opened an investigation into the park. That investigation led to the provincial animal welfare agency declaring that all the park's marine life was under distress because of poor water quality. By 2024, after investing in new technology, the water quality had been improved, the provincial government told the Canadian Press news agency. But that same year, Marineland was found guilty, under Ontario's animal cruelty laws, of abusing and neglecting three young black bears who were kept in small enclosures with inadequate access to water for months. In total, twenty whales  - one orca and 19 belugas  - have died at Marineland since 2019, according to the Canadian Press. The company has said the animals were well treated, and the deaths were part of the natural life cycle. Park facing bankruptcy Attendance at the park has drastically declined, and this spring it did not open to tourists, as it usually did. Many assume bankruptcy is inevitable. ""Unfortunately, they're telling us they're burning the furniture to heat the house,"" Niagara Falls mayor Jim Diodati told Radio-Canada on Friday. ""There's no money."" Park officials say they cannot afford to continue caring for the animals, and so they must find them a new home. Marineland applied for a permit from the federal government to sell the whales to a theme park in Zhuhai, China. But Fisheries Minister Joanne Thompson said the whales would face similarly substandard treatment as ""public entertainment"" in the Chinese park, and denied Marineland's request. A number of organizations agreed with Thompson that the park in Zhuhai was not a suitable option. Then last week, the park shocked many when it told the government it may have to  euthanise the whales. It has asked the Canadian government for funding to continue to care for the animals instead. A Marineland letter to the fisheries ministry, obtained by the BBC, said that whatever happens to the animals would be ""a direct consequence of the minister's decision"". That assertion was not well received by the government. ""The fact that Marineland has not planned for a viable alternative despite raising these whales in captivity for many years, does not place the onus on the Canadian government to cover your expenses,"" Thompson said in a letter to Marineland, obtained by the BBC. The current status of the whales remains unclear. Marineland did not respond to a BBC request for comment. But Phil Demers - who worked for 12 years as a senior trainer at  Marineland and has since become an outspoken critic - told the BBC that there were limited options, besides the one in China, that could take all 30 whales at one facility. He believes the best-case scenario for the whales is any option that gets them out of Marineland, quickly. Without China, he thinks the best possible outcome is a coalition of US facilities each taking a handful of whales. ""These animals need to be out of those waters, yesterday,"" Mr Demers said. AFP via Getty Images Protest outside Marineland in 2012 Clock ticking on finding whales new homes Others say the conditions warrant the provincial government stepping in and seizing the whales. Ontario can appoint inspectors to assume care of animals in distress and recover costs from the facility's owner, under the Provincial Animal Welfare Services (PAWS) Act. That is a first step many want to see Ontario Premier Doug Ford take. ""Premier Ford needs to realize whether he likes it or not, Ontario has primary jurisdiction over captive wildlife within the province's borders,"" Colin Saravanamuttoo, Executive Director of World Animal Protection Canada, said. ""This game of chicken between Marineland, the province and Ottawa is totally unacceptable – Premier Ford needs to step up, lead and stop passing the buck."" The Whale and Dolphin Conservation, an animal welfare organisation, also wrote to Ford asking him to commission independent veterinary assessments of each whale so ""that every individual receives a humane and compassionate outcome"". Ford's office did not return the BBC's request for comment. The Whale and Dolphin Conservation wants to see the whales sent to a sanctuary in Nova Scotia run by The Whale Sanctuary Project. But there are some caveats. Charles Vinick, Chief Executive Officer of the Whale Sanctuary, said that facility will not be ready until next summer and will only be able to take eight to ten of the whales. ""There is no open sanctuary who can accommodate them today or tomorrow,"" he said. For now, as options for how to save the whales continue to be discussed, there's widespread confidence that Marineland's talk of euthanasia is just talk. ""The whole threat of euthanasia is a bluster,"" Mr Demers, the former Marineland employee, said. But the clock is ticking to find a  solution that gives these animals a better, safer life. ""It's going to take more than one person, or one organization to provide these animals the quality life they deserve,"" Mr Vinick said.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0kn6x711y2o,World (International),BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/2d27/live/858e65d0-a6c7-11f0-b741-177e3e2c2fc7.jpg,2025-10-11T23:23:30.899000+00:00,a72d9236130f41444c19da3b99d6dad048ad5fbf
0f41a9ccbed6,'It's going to be really bad': Fears over AI bubble bursting grow in Silicon Valley,,"'It's going to be really bad': Fears over AI bubble bursting grow in Silicon Valley Lily Jamali Technology correspondent, San Francisco Getty Images Silicon Valley is home to many major tech firms, including Apple's circular headquarters At OpenAI's DevDay this week, OpenAI boss Sam Altman did what American tech bosses rarely do these days: he actually answered questions from reporters. ""I know it's tempting to write the bubble story,"" Mr Altman told me as he sat flanked by his top lieutenants. ""In fact, there are many parts of AI that I think are kind of bubbly right now."" In Silicon Valley, the debate over whether AI companies are overvalued has taken on a new urgency. Sceptics are privately - and some now publicly - asking whether the rapid rise in the value of AI tech companies may be, at least in part, the result of what they call ""financial engineering"". In other words - there are fears these companies are overvalued. Mr Altman said he expected investors would make some bad calls and silly start-ups would walk away with crazy money. But with OpenAI, he told me, ""there's something real happening here"". Not everyone is convinced. In recent days, warnings of an AI bubble have come from the Bank of England, the International Monetary Fund, as well as JP Morgan boss Jamie Dimon who told the BBC ""the level of uncertainty should be higher in most people's minds"". And here, in what is often considered the tech capital of the world, concerns are growing. At a panel discussion at Silicon Valley's Computer History Museum this week, early AI entrepreneur Jerry Kaplan told a packed audience he has lived through four bubbles. Getty Images Jerry Kaplan founded Go Corporation, which developed early tablet computers He's especially concerned now given the magnitude of money on the table as compared to the dot-com boom. There's so much more to lose. ""When [the bubble] breaks, it's going to be really bad, and not just for people in AI,"" he said. ""It's going to drag down the rest of the economy."" However, at the Stanford Graduate School of Business, which has minted its fair share of tech entrepreneurs, Prof Anat Admati says while there have been many attempts to model when we're in the bubble, it can be a futile exercise. ""It is very hard to time a bubble,"" Prof Admati told me. ""And you can't say with certainty you were in one until after the bubble has burst."" But the data is concerning to many. AI-related enterprises have accounted for 80% of the stunning gains in the American stock market this year - and Gartner estimates global spending on AI will likely reach a whopping $1.5tn (£1.1tn) before 2025 is out. Tangled web of deals OpenAI, which brought AI into the consumer mainstream with ChatGPT in 2022, is at the centre of the tangled web of deals drawing scrutiny. For example - last month, it entered into a $100bn deal with chipmaker Nvidia, which is itself the most valuable publicly traded company in the world. It expands an existing investment Nvidia already had in Mr Altman's company - with  expectations that OpenAI will build data centres powered with Nvidia's advanced chips. Then on Monday, OpenAI announced plans to purchase billions of dollars worth of equipment for developing AI from Nvidia rival AMD, in a deal that could make it one of AMD's largest shareholders. Remember this is a private company, albeit one recently valued at a half-trillion dollars . Then there's tech giant Microsoft, which is heavily invested, and cloud computing behemoth Oracle has a $300bn deal with OpenAI, too. OpenAI's Stargate project in Abilene, Texas, funded with the help of Oracle and Japanese conglomerate SoftBank and announced at the White House during President Donald Trump's first week in office, grows ever larger every few months. And as for Nvidia, it has a stake in AI startup CoreWeave - which supplies OpenAI with some of its massive infrastructure needs. Getty Images OpenAI boss Sam Altman And as these increasingly complex financing arrangements get more and more common, the experts here in Silicon Valley say they may be clouding perceptions on AI demand. Some people aren't mincing their words about it either, calling the deals ""circular financing"" or even ""vendor financing"" - where a company invests in or lends to its own customers so they can continue making purchases. ""Yes, the investment loans are unprecedented,"" Mr Altman told me on Monday. But, he added, ""it's also unprecedented for companies to be growing revenue this fast."" OpenAI's revenue is growing quickly, but it has never turned a profit. And it is hardly a good sign that the people I've spoken to keep bringing up Nortel - the Canadian telecom equipment-maker that borrowed prolifically to help finance deals for their customers (and thereby artificially boost demand for their wares). For his part, Nvidia's Jensen Huang defended his deal with OpenAI on CNBC Monday, saying the firm isn't required to buy his company's tech with the money he invests. ""They can use it to do anything they like,"" Huang said. ""There's no exclusivities. Our primary goal is just really to support them and help them grow – and grow the ecosystem."" Telltale signs Mr Kaplan says he sees a couple of telltale signs the AI sector - and therefore the wider economy - could be in trouble. In frothy times, he says, companies announce major initiatives and product plans that they don't yet have the capital for. Meanwhile, retail investors clamour to get in on the start-up action. The surge in AMD stock this week could indicate investors are trying to get a piece of the ChatGPT wealth machine - and while all this is playing out, real physical infrastructure aimed at satisfying the seemingly insatiable hunger for more AI development is being built. ""We're creating a new man-made ecological disaster: enormous data centres in remote places like deserts, that will be rusting away and leaching bad things into the environment, with no one left to hold accountable because the builders and investors will be long gone,"" Mr Kaplan said. Getty Images OpenAI wants to secure $500bn to build a 10-gigawatt complex, under construction in Texas, by the end of this year. But even if we are in a bubble, the hope from Silicon Valley is investments being made now won't necessarily go to waste. ""The thing that comforts me is that the internet was built on the ashes of the over-investment into the telecom infrastructure of yesterday,"" said Jeff Boudier, who builds products at the AI community hub Hugging Face. ""If there is overinvestment into infrastructure for AI workloads, there may be financial risks tied to it,"" he said. ""But it's going to enable lots of great new products and experiences including ones we're not thinking about today."" There are plenty of believers in AI's potential to transform society. The question is whether the money to fund the ambitions of the foremost companies in the sector may be drying up. ""Nvidia looks like the last lender or investor,"" said Rihard Jarc, who founded the UncoverAlpha newsletter.

Hugo Bachega Middle East correspondent, Jerusalem and BBC Visual Journalism team Getty Images A ceasefire has come into effect for the war in Gaza, after the Israeli government approved a US-brokered deal with Hamas in negotiations that had the personal involvement of US President Donald Trump. The full text of the agreement has not been made public - but part of it has been published by Israeli media. It appears to lack details and in some cases is vague and ambiguous - perhaps on purpose. Even its title, ""Implementation steps for President Trump's proposal for a comprehensive end of Gaza War"", leaves room for different interpretations. The full title suggests these are steps for the implementation of the 20-point plan that President Trump announced at the White House last week. The document was agreed after negotiations in Egypt over the first phase of the plan, related to a ceasefire, a hostage and prisoner exchange, and a surge in humanitarian aid. However, by highlighting ""Comprehensive end of Gaza war"", the document appears to be announcing the end of the two-year-old war. This paragraph explicitly says the war is over, which sets the scene for future discussions on later stages of the president's plan for Gaza. It appears to suggest that, even if the negotiations reach an impasse, hostilities will not resume. This is crucial as key sticking points remain, including the Israeli demand for Hamas to disarm, the scale of the Israeli withdrawal, and a plan for who will govern the territory. The document does not mention guarantees that could have been given that the conflict will not restart, or what could happen if either side returns to fighting. Speaking after the deal was reached, Hamas's exiled Gaza leader, Khalil Al-Hayya, said he had received assurances from the US and other mediators that the war had ended. Meanwhile, the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has not publicly said that the conflict is over. Following the approval of the deal by the Israeli government, Netanyahu released a video in which he appeared to threaten to use force if Israel's demands, including Hamas's disarmament, were not met. ""If this is achieved in the easy way, it's all for the better. And if not, it'll be achieved the hard way,"" he said. The document does not mention the next steps for the full implementation of Trump's plan. This appears to leave room for a return of Israeli troops to areas they had withdrawn from if Hamas is seen as not being fully compliant with the deal. It provides no details about what could constitute a violation. And the text does not explicitly rule out air strikes. Prior to the deal, Hamas officials were concerned that there would be a situation like the one in Lebanon, where a ceasefire deal has not prevented near-daily air strikes on people and targets Israel says are linked to Hezbollah, the Shia militia and political movement. The Lebanese government says Israel's actions are violations of the deal, which was also brokered with US help. Despite the demand that all hostages, alive and dead, should be freed within 72 hours of the partial Israeli withdrawal, the text concedes, although not explicitly, that Hamas is unlikely to be able to retrieve all bodies from deceased hostages within that timeframe, allowing the group to share the information it had gathered about those that could not be located. The text does not say what could happen in case of delays in freeing the 20 captives believed to be alive. This suggests the creation of a mechanism to monitor the deal and report any violations. US officials said separately that the US was moving up to 200 troops already based in the Middle East to co-ordinate the multination force. Assuming the hostage and prisoner exchange is completed, the officials said the intention was for a so-called International Stabilisation Force to be built, although this was yet to be agreed between the sides. Next phase of deal unclear This deal is a significant diplomatic breakthrough led by Trump, who wants to be remembered as the one who brought the conflict to an end. The president employed American leverage to force Netanyahu, who has been accused of sabotaging earlier efforts for a deal, to engage with the negotiations. Hamas came under pressure from Egypt, Qatar and Turkey, and from a population in desperate need of help. Israel launched the war in response to the Hamas attacks on 7 October 2023, when around 1,200 people were killed, mostly civilians, and 251 were taken hostage. Israel's military campaign has killed more than 67,000 Palestinians, mostly civilians and including more than 18,000 children, according to the Hamas-run health ministry, and led to a catastrophic humanitarian crisis. The first phase of the president's plan was, perhaps, the easiest one. Netanyahu was also facing growing domestic pressure, with polls consistently suggesting that the vast majority of Israelis wanted a deal with Hamas and the end of the war. Hamas, meanwhile, was apparently convinced that keeping the hostages had become a burden, giving Israel a reason to continue fighting. What happens next, however, is not clear. Progress will only happen if the Trump administration remains engaged, as both Israel and Hamas have reasons to stall the process. There is momentum, but major obstacles remain.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckgyr8e0gl2o,World (International),BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/3fad/live/2ef94db0-a5fb-11f0-92db-77261a15b9d2.jpg,2025-10-10T17:25:41.270000+00:00,824b5de6d8f88f9aa6dca1f0fc6d5a224753621e
7ea192d33038,'They treated us like animals' - Inside the epicentre of deportations in New York City,,"'They treated us like animals' - Inside the epicentre of deportations in New York City Kayla Epstein in New York City and Leire Ventas BBC News Mundo Getty Images Monica Moreta Galarza was thrown to the ground when her husband was arrested outside immigration court in New York City Monica Moreta Galarza felt relieved after her husband's routine immigration hearing at New York City's 26 Federal Plaza. A judge had ordered Rubén Abelardo Ortiz López to return to court in May, and she believed that meant a reprieve from his potential deportation to Ecuador. Instead, as soon as they stepped out of the courtroom with their children, she was torn from her husband's arms and thrown to the ground by immigration officers as they detained him. ""One of them charged at me so aggressively that I was terrified, and he ended up throwing me to the ground,"" Ms Moreta Galarza told BBC News Mundo in Spanish. ""They treated us like animals."" The incident, which has since gone viral, led to one immigration agent being temporarily suspended. But it is not an isolated occurrence. The BBC witnessed similar incidents at the court house, while others – including an aggressive encounter between Immigrations and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and the media – have sparked public outcry. ICE's operations inside the building have created a charged, tense environment, attorneys said. ""I would honestly sum it up as just traumatic,"" said Allison Cutler, a New York Legal Assistance Group (NYLAG) attorney who works at 26 Federal Plaza. ""It's traumatic for the clients we're serving, for the families getting ripped apart."" Getty Images Federal immigration officers wearing masks and sunglasses detain a man who appeared for his hearing at 26 Federal Plaza in New York City on 30 July While many of the detentions at 26 Federal Plaza are swift and non-violent, reporters and lawyers have witnessed several chaotic episodes in recent weeks. On a Tuesday in late August, the BBC watched as a dozen officers waiting outside a courtroom descended on a man, two women and a small boy. They quickly detained the man, and a melee ensued as the group fought to stay together. The crying woman, clinging to the detained man, was wrenched away by a federal officer - who appeared to be the same man who pulled Ms Moreta Galarza from her husband - as the man was carted off. The judge closed the courtroom and, as a result, the BBC could not verify details of the case. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) did not provide details of the man's current status, but stated that the agency ""takes its responsibility to protect children seriously"". They added that ICE gives parents the option of being removed with their children or having them placed with a designated individual. After the images of the incident with Ms Moreta Galarza spread on social media, DHS reported that the officer involved in the incident had been disciplined. Then last week, immigration officers were captured on video shoving two journalists to the ground as they tried to document a possible detention. One of the journalists could not get up, and was transported to the hospital. ""Nothing like this has happened with journalists before,"" Olga Fedorova, the other photojournalist thrown to the floor, told the BBC. Ms Fedorova frequently reports from the building and said that before the incident, ""we were able to work with federal agents, around federal agents with no incidents 99% of the time"". DHS spokeswoman Tricia McLaughlin told the BBC in a statement that officers were making an arrest when they were ""swarmed by agitators and members of the press, which obstructed operations"". Ms McLaughlin said that ""officers repeatedly told the crowd of agitators and journalists to get back, move, and get out of the elevator"". Chaotic encounters with government officials have played out multiple times in the lower Manhattan building this year, as immigration courts become key sites of a mass deportation initiative ordered by the Trump administration. Half of the 3,320 immigrants ICE has detained in the New York City area between Trump's inauguration and the end of July were arrested at 26 Federal Plaza, according to data obtained by the Deportation Data Project. The numbers suggest the building's immigration courts and offices are a primary engine of the administration's deportation plans in America's biggest city. About three quarters of people arrested at 26 Federal Plaza since Trump's inauguration did not have past criminal convictions or pending criminal charges, the Deportation Data Project numbers suggest. Officers routinely pull multiple detainees from their hearings, without giving them the chance to speak to lawyers. ""We've never seen anything like this,"" said Benjamin Remy, a NYLAG lawyer who spends several days a week working with immigrants at Federal Plaza. Many immigrants no longer show up to court, he said. At one August hearing, a man with a criminal record failed to appear. The judge therefore ordered him removed from the country and threw out his asylum case. His attendance may not have changed the outcome; immigration enforcement was assembled outside that courtroom as well. Non-citizens in the US without a visa or similar documentation have always been subject to removal, said Triciah Claxton, supervising attorney with Safe Passage, an immigration rights group focused on minors. ""There used to be a concentrated effort on those who might have had criminal histories or prior arrests,"" said Ms Claxton, whose clients mostly appear virtually to avoid detention. But now, she said, that net appears to have widened. ""You see a lot of people who are in the process - they have asylum claims pending, they have other forms of relief pending – are still being taken in,"" Ms Claxton said. Getty Images People wait to enter immigration court as federal agents patrol the halls Legal experts say this is an abuse of the courts system and puts immigrants into an impossible position. If they turn up for court hearings, as they are instructed to do, they could be arrested. But if they skip their court date, a judge could automatically order their deportation. The government argues it has broad authority to detain people who are in the US illegally. The administration says it is removing dangerous criminals from the country, and the White House and Department of Homeland Security frequently tout the arrests and detentions of undocumented migrants with violent criminal histories. It says it makes arrests in immigration court for safety reasons. ""DHS enforcement operations are highly targeted, and officers do their due diligence. We know who we are targeting ahead of time,"" an agency official said in a statement to BBC. A New York Times/Siena poll found that the majority of respondents, 54%, supported deporting people who are here illegally. Over half (51%) felt the government was targeting the right people. In the case of Rubén Abelardo Ortiz López, whose wife Ms Moreta Galarza was pushed to the floor, the government says he was a violent criminal, and that it was justified in arresting him at court. Ortiz López entered the country illegally on 20 March 2024 and was wanted after being arrested on 18 June for ""assault and criminal obstruction of airway or bloodstream"". ""President Trump and Secretary (of Homeland Security Kristi) Noem will not allow criminal illegal aliens to terrorize American citizens,"" the statement added. ""If you come to our country illegally and break our laws, we will arrest you and you will never return."" But for Ms Moreta Galarza, the incident at the courthouse reminded her of the injustices she says she fled in her home country of Ecuador. ""I suffered a lot in my country. I had no protection and the authorities there didn't care,"" she tells BBC News Mundo. She adds that she never thought the same thing would happen to her in the US. ""It's very ugly. I feel like I'm worthless now.""",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn0rxrxd444o,World (International),BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/c595/live/806bc710-a68a-11f0-928c-71dbb8619e94.jpg,2025-10-11T00:35:36.624000+00:00,3c4803ac04acc76d441ec9cc5274541b42cbd410
5431c66225f0,Can the world's oldest president keep his title and woo a nation of young voters?,,"Can the world's oldest president keep his title and woo a nation of young voters? Paul Njie BBC Africa, Yaoundé AFP/Getty Images The world's oldest head of state - 92-year-old Paul Biya - has promised Cameroon's electorate ""the best is still to come"" as he seeks his eighth consecutive presidential term on Sunday. The nonagenarian has already been in power since 1982 - another seven-year mandate could see him rule for 50 years until he will be almost 100. He defied widespread calls to step down and has been criticised for only showing up for one rally, spending most of the campaign period on a 10-day private trip to Europe. A backlash over his reliance on an AI-generated campaign video, as his opponents actively wooed voters on the ground, saw him rush north on his return home. In the vote-rich city of Maroua on Tuesday he addressed crowds of his party supporters - reaching out in particular to women and young people, promising to prioritise their plight in his next mandate. ""I will keep my word,"" he insisted, urging them to ""give me your valuable support once again"". But political analyst Immanuel Wanah tells the BBC that Biya's primary focus since coming to power has been to stay in power, ""often at the expense of efforts to enhance the living conditions of the country's citizens"". It is a view echoed by Dr Tilarius Atia, another political analyst, who puts this survivalist mindset down to an abortive coup against Biya in 1984. It means that for the vast majority of the population, Biya is the only president they have known - more than 60% of Cameroon's 30 million people are below the age of 25. Young political activist Marie Flore Mboussi is desperate for ""new blood"" as she believes ""longevity in power inevitably leads to a kind of laziness"". ""After 43 years, the people are tired,"" she tells the BBC. The presidential election comes amid growing concerns about inflation, security challenges, poor social services, corruption and unemployment. Youth unemployment has been a particular talking point for most of the candidates running in the election. Nearly 40% of young Cameroonians between the ages of 15 and 35 are unemployed, with 23% of young graduates facing challenges in obtaining formal employment, according to the International Organization for Migration (IOM). ""Young people are more inclined to emigrate abroad because they tell themselves that inside the country, they do not have the possibility of becoming somebody,"" 26-old-year graduate Vanina Nzekui tells the BBC. ""They tell themselves that all positions are occupied by older people,"" she says, adding that this comes at the cost of using their skills to help develop the country. But Aziseh Mbi, 23, believes age should not be a criterion for leadership. In Biya's case, the civil society activist says, the president has been able to do ""significant things,"" citing several youth initiatives. Reuters President Biya was keen to appeal to women and young people during his only election rally Beyond youth unemployment, the electoral process has also stirred controversy, especially with the exclusion of Maurice Kamto from the presidential race. In July the electoral body barred the 71-year-old opposition leader from running because a rival faction of the party that had endorsed him presented someone else as a candidate. His exclusion, confirmed by the Constitutional Council, was widely criticised as a ploy to prevent any strong challenge to President Biya. After coming second in the 2018 presidential election, Kamto claimed victory and organised street protests. ""The exclusion of Prof Kamto waters down the legitimacy of our democracy because we should have been fair enough to allow for everybody to partake,"" says Dr Atia. Mr Wanah agrees that the absence of the country's main opposition figure ""reinforces the perception that truly fair elections cannot take place in Cameroon"". Twelve candidates were approved to contest for the country's top job, including Issa Tchiroma Bakary and Bello Bouba Maigari - both former Biya allies from the north of the country. They resigned from their ministerial positions in government to take on their boss. Lawmaker Cabral Libii, chairman of the opposition Social Democratic Front (SDF) party Joshua Osih and Patricia Tomaïno Ndam Njoya - the lone female candidate - are also in the race. At the launch of the election campaign, two aspirants, including renowned anti-corruption lawyer Akere Muna, withdrew their candidacies to support Maigari of the NUDP party. This means 10 people will now compete for the presidency. Michel Mvondo / BBC Two candidates have withdrawn from the race and thrown their weight behind Bello Bouba Maigari, once a Biya ally Prior to the poll - which will only be a single-round vote as the person with the most votes will win - there had been widespread calls for the opposition to present a single candidate to challenge Biya, who has never lost an election. Tchiroma Bakary has secured the support of the Union for Change, a coalition of more than 50 political groups and civil society organisations who presented him as the opposition's consensus candidate. But the initiative has failed to gain unanimity, with others refusing to rally behind him. Kamto said he had held talks with some aspirants, including the two northern figures Tchiroma Bakary and Maigari, encouraging them to unite. As neither seemed ready to step down, he urged Cameroonians to vote for whomever they preferred. Dr Atia reckons the failure to endorse one candidate under a single coalition will cost the opposition at the ballot box. On the campaign trail, 76-year-old Tchiroma Bakary, a former government spokesperson, has been pulling big crowds - with some analysts positioning  the Cameroon National Salvation Front party leader as Biya's main challenger. On Sunday, thousands of supporters waited for hours in the rain to see him in the economic capital Douala. He has promised to reform the system of which he was a part for two decades. Despite Tchiroma Bakary's support base in the north, analysts say Biya is likely to overpower him and the other opposition candidates. ""President Biya just needs a slim majority to win the election, and I see him winning despite the efforts being made by the opposition,"" says Dr Atia. Michel Mvondo / BBC Former government spokesperson Issa Tchiroma Bakary has promised reform and is drawing big crowds In Cameroon's English-speaking North-West and South-West regions, where a long-running separatist conflict continues, an election boycott lockdown has been imposed, paralysing business activities, movement and education. The separatists who have imposed it have threatened to target anyone who does vote. ""We have seen people [who] have been pulled out of their homes and slaughtered in cold blood, before, during, and even well after [previous] elections when they are identified,"" Samah Abang-Mugwa, a resident of one of the Anglophone regions, tells the BBC - adding that he will not risk casting his ballot. Since 2017, those seeking to create a breakaway state have been fighting government forces. They are angered by what they see as the marginalisation of Cameroon's minority Anglophone community by the Francophone-dominated government. The conflict has so far killed at least 6,000 people and forced nearly half a million others from their homes, according to the UN. According to civil society activist Abine Ayah, the likely exclusion of much of the English-speaking community could undermine the legitimacy of the election. Although Biya says his government has made significant efforts to resolve the conflict, his opponents in the presidential race continue to criticise his handling of the situation. After Sunday's vote, the Constitutional Council has 15 days to announce the results. The interior minister has already warned that no candidate is allowed to declare victory beforehand. Paul Atanga Nji made the comments on the eve of the last day of campaigning. ""Those who will attempt to announce results of the presidential election or any self-proclaimed victory in violation of the laws of the republic would have crossed the red line and should be ready to face the retaliatory measures commensurate to their crime.""

Once hunted extensively for turtle soup, its eggs as a delicacy and decorative shells, the ancient mariner saw its numbers plummet and has been listed as endangered since the 1980s. Now, thanks to decades of global conservation efforts - from protecting eggs and releasing hatchlings on beaches, to reducing accidental capture in fishing nets - new data shows green turtle populations are rebounding. ""We must use this win as a catalyst to achieve numerous other wins,"" said Dr Nicolas Pilcher of the Marine Research Foundation, a non-profit based in Sabah, Malaysia. Getty Green turtle hatchling heading for the ocean after emerging from a nest buried in sand Green turtles are one of the largest species of sea turtles, named for the greenish colour of their body fat, which comes from their plant-based diet. They are one of seven living species of sea turtles, two of which are critically endangered. Prof Brendan Godley, a conservation scientist at the University of Exeter, said green turtle populations in many parts of the world are showing signs of recovery due to conservation efforts over the last five decades, and while this work must continue for years to come, it gives cause for optimism. ""Sea turtles are iconic and charismatic species... they inspire people,"" he said. ""Hundreds of thousands of people have been working for decades to try and look after these creatures, and undoubtedly, it has had an impact."" The conservation efforts include patrolling beaches, protecting females and their eggs at nesting sites, releasing hatchlings into the sea, education and awareness to reduce turtles being killed for meat and eggs, and using measures to stop turtles being captured in fishing nets. Getty A green sea turtle tangled in a fishing net off Pangasinan in the Philippines was rescued by local fishermen, tagged by environment officials, and safely released back into the sea The latest Red List of endangered species was revealed at the IUCN (International Union for the Conservation of Nature) world congress in Abu Dhabi. The unenviable list now includes 172,620 species, of which 48,646 are threatened with extinction. Species are moved between categories when new data shows changes in their population, habitat or threats. If a species becomes more at risk - for example, its numbers fall or its habitat is damaged - it may be moved to a higher-risk category such as Endangered; if it recovers thanks to conservation efforts, it may shift to a lower-risk category like Near Threatened or Least Concern. The green turtle has been downgraded from Endangered to Least Concern. However, despite recent gains, green turtles are still far below their historic numbers due to past overexploitation and ongoing threats like fishing, habitat loss and climate change. In places like Raine Island, Australia, fewer baby turtles are hatching, showing that conservation efforts are still urgently needed. Kit Kovacs Bearded seal pup on ice The update to the endangered list brought bad news for other species, including Arctic seals, which are moving closer to extinction as sea ice is lost to climate change. The hooded seal has moved from Vulnerable to Endangered, while the bearded and harp seals are now Near Threatened due to shrinking sea ice.

20c9479325ca,Fossil found on Dorset coast is unique 'sword dragon' species,,"Fossil found on Dorset coast is unique 'sword dragon' species Jonah Fisher Environment correspondent Dean Lomax Ichthyosaur experts Dr Dean Lomax and Professor Judy Massare with the 185m year old skeleton A near-complete skeleton found on Dorset's Jurassic coast has been identified as a new species of ichthyosaur, a type of prehistoric marine reptile that once ruled the oceans. The dolphin-sized ichthyosaur has been named Xiphodracon goldencapensis, or the ""sword dragon of Dorset"" and is the only known example of its kind. Scientists say that marks on its skull suggest that the ""sword dragon"" may have been killed by a bite to the head, possibly inflicted by a much larger species of ichthyosaur. First discovered by a prolific fossil hunter at Golden Cap in Dorset in 2001 the new ichthyosaur was then acquired by a museum in Canada. Dean Lomax The skull of the ""sword dragon"" has a huge eye socket and a mark on its head that suggests it may have been attacked by another larger ichthyosaur It has only recently been fully analysed by experts and a paper published identifying it as a new species of ichthyosaur. ""I thought long and hard about the name,"" said ichthyosaur expert Dr Dean Lomax, who co-authored authored the paper identifying the skeleton as a new species. ""Xiphodracon translates to sword-like dragon and that is in reference to that very long, sword-like snout, but also the fact that ichthyosaurs have been referred to as sea dragons for about 200 years."" Getty Images This is a what ichthyosaurs may have looked like. This particular species is a shonisaurus which could grow to more than 15 metres long. Ichthyosaurs are classified as marine reptiles, not dinosaurs, and spent their lives in the water. This particular ichthyosaur is thought to have swum the seas about 185 million years ago, a period from which very few ichthyosaur fossils have been found. ""During this time ichthyosaurs are incredibly rare, and Xiphodracon is the most complete individual ever found from there, helping to fill a gap,"" Dr Lomax said. ""It's a missing piece of the puzzle in the ichthyosaur evolution."" The ""sword dragon"" is thought to have been about 3m long and has several features that have not been seen in other species of ichthyosaur.  Scientists say the strangest  detail is a prong-like bone near its nostril. The skull has an enormous eye socket and a long sword-like snout that it used to eat fish and squid. There are also clues as to how this particular specimen lived and died. ""The limb bones and teeth are malformed in such a way that points to serious injury or disease while the animal was still alive, "" said study co-author Dr Erin Maxwell from the State Museum of Natural History Stuttgart. ""The skull appears to have been bitten by a large predator - likely another much larger species of ichthyosaur - giving us a cause of death for this individual. Life in the Mesozoic oceans was a dangerous prospect."" The 'sword dragon' is one of numerous ichthyosaur fossils that have been found along Dorset's Jurassic Coast since the first discoveries of pioneering palaeontologist Mary Anning in the early 1800s. Chris Moore Chris Moore discovered the 'sword dragon' in cliffs at Golden Cap in Dorset after a storm This ""sword dragon"" was discovered in 2001 by fossil hunter Chris Moore and then acquired by the Royal Ontario Museum in Canada where it took more than 15 years to be fully analysed. ""I don't wish to blow my own ichthyosaur trumpet but I have found a few of them,"" Mr Moore said on a video call from Dorset. The actual number he's unearthed is somewhere in the region of 15, with several of them, like the ""sword dragon"", turning out to be new species. Mr Moore says he is planning to celebrate the new discovery but has yet to decide exactly how. ""Champagne or a mug of tea, I'm not sure which yet,"" he says.

d85b5b11f646,'How growing a sunflower helped me fight anorexia',,"'How growing a sunflower helped me fight anorexia' Malcolm Prior and Jenny Kumah BBC News rural affairs team Andy Alcroft/BBC Emily Hough is now using her experiences to help shape nature prescribing schemes For Emily Hough, nature was too often simply something ""out there"", a world apart from her, a view from a hospital window. Years spent in and out of specialist mental health units in Birmingham and London, being treated for the eating disorder she had had since the age of 12, meant she felt little connection with the countryside or interest in the everyday flora and fauna around her. That was until five years ago, when a hospital occupational therapist gave her an unusual prescription: Grow a sunflower. ""I'll be honest I'd never planted anything in my life,"" Ms Hough said. ""But I planted that sunflower and, just watching it grow, from me watering it and from me protecting it from the shade, helped me feel connected for the first time and really be able to appreciate what was around me - and how I can make a difference to nature and what nature can actually do for me. ""I was in a hospital at that point, so it was very limited. Fast forward five years, here we are today."" Getty Images Green social prescribing encourages people to take part in nature-based activities to benefit their health and wellbeing From those early roots, Ms Hough, now 35, embraced what is formally called by the NHS ""green social prescribing"" , where GPs and health practitioners refer patients to organisations that offer nature-based activities, whether that be hiking, birdwatching, rockpooling or looking after a city-based allotment. It is supposed to complement other more mainstream treatments and therapies and has been a key part of the government's 10-year plan for the NHS in England. The scheme may not work for everyone but for Ms Hough, who has now relocated from Solihull to a life in the countryside, the benefits have been profound. She is now out of hospital and has become what the NHS calls an ""Expert by Experience"" (EbE) - someone who uses that experience to design and evaluate new health services. She helped shape the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds (RSPB)'s flagship ""nature prescription"" scheme for the West Midlands, launched earlier this year. On Friday – World Mental Health Day - the scheme marks the training of its 100th health professional, with enough resources to support 1,000 patients accessing nature-based activities. Andy Alcroft/BBC Dom Higgins, from the Wildlife Trusts, saids the evidence in favour of green social prescribing was clear But the future of green social prescribing is uncertain. Despite a four-year national pilot that ended in March being judged a success by an independent evaluation of its first two years, there is concern that the onus for funding these schemes is being left to charities. Organisations, including The Wildlife Trusts, the RSPB and the Ocean Conservation Trust, are calling on the government to commit more funding to nature prescription schemes and to roll them out, beyond their initial seven trial areas. Dom Higgins, head of health and education for The Wildlife Trusts, said: ""It is unequivocal that nature improves mental health. ""I think the time for questioning the evidence is really over and people within the system and the NHS and decision makers get this. ""It's just we need the mechanism to make it available everywhere. It's time to seriously fund prevention and opportunities for people to create good health in the neighbourhoods where they live and work."" The national pilot scheme saw nearly 8,500 people prescribed nature activities in its first two years, with more than half those patients living in socio-economically deprived areas. Chris Dayson, professor of voluntary action, health and wellbeing at Sheffield Hallam University, who was part of the team that evaluated the scheme, said it brought ""a really statistically significant increase in wellbeing"" for patients. The evaluation also found the scheme brought an economic social return - not least of all by getting people back into work - of £2.42 for every £1 invested. When approached by the BBC, the government did not comment on the future of green social prescribing but said the evaluation of the second two years of the trial scheme would be published ""in due course"". 'Dramatic results' Although green social prescribing is designed to complement, not replace, conventional medical treatments and therapies, there are some who fear it does not deal with the bigger social health issues around mental health. Rob Poole, professor of social psychiatry at the Centre for Mental Health and Society, said that, while he was not against green social prescribing, it was an ""inadequate response to the social determinants of health, such as poor housing, poverty and deterioration in social infrastructure"". ""These are not lifestyle choices. They cannot be addressed by time-limited interventions, no matter how much better green activity makes you feel in the short run,"" he said. But Shannon Kang, an NHS health and wellbeing coach at the University Medical Practice in Birmingham, who has recently been trained in nature prescribing by the RSPB, said she had seen ""dramatic results"" - with patients' anxiety and stress levels reduced. For Ms Hough, getting in touch with the natural world has been life-changing: ""I was sceptical. For years I had walked around not appreciating nature. But I genuinely believe that nature has really helped save me. It has given me hope.""

A new study of the bizarre naked mole rat shows that the animals have evolved a DNA repair mechanism that could explain their longevity. These burrow-dwelling rats have a maximum life span of nearly 40 years, making them the world's longest-lived rodent. The new findings, published in the journal Science , could also shed light on why naked mole rats are resistant to a wide range of age-related diseases. The animals are resistant to cancer, deterioration of the brain and spinal cord, and arthritis, so many scientists want to understand more about how their bodies work. For this study, led by a team at Tonji University in Shanghai, China, the focus was DNA repair - a natural process in our bodies' cells. When strands of DNA - our genetic building blocks - are damaged, a mechanism is triggered whereby another undamaged strand of DNA is used as a template to repair the break. The focus of this research was on a particular protein that is involved in that system of damage sensing and repair. When a cell senses the damage, one of the substances it produces is a protein called c-GAS. That plays several roles, but what was of interest to these scientists is that in humans, it interferes with and hampers the process by which DNA is knitted back together. Scientists think that this interference could promote cancer and shorten our lifespan. In naked mole rats though, the researchers found that the exact same protein does the opposite. It helps the body mend strands of DNA and keeps the genetic code in each cell intact. Chicago Tribune via Getty Images Naked mole rats live in a network of underground tunnels and chambers Professor Gabriel Balmus studies DNA repair and ageing at the University of Cambridge. He said the discovery was exciting and ""the tip of the iceberg"" when it comes to understanding why these animals live such extraordinarily long lives. ""You can think of cGAS as a biological Lego piece - the same basic shape in humans and naked mole-rats, but in the mole-rat version a few connectors are flipped, allowing it to assemble an entirely different structure and function."" Over millions of years of evolution, Prof Balmus explained, naked mole-rats appear to have rewired the same pathway and ""used it to their advantage"". ""This finding raises fundamental questions: how did evolution reprogram the same protein to act in reverse? What changed? And is this an isolated case or part of a broader evolutionary pattern?"" Most importantly, scientists want to know what they can learn from these rodents to improve human health and extend quality of life with age. ""I think if we could reverse-engineer the naked mole-rat's biology,"" said Prof Balmus, ""we might bring some much-needed therapies for an ageing society.""",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cz7rxy21lxwo,Science,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/d1e4/live/bb740ed0-a4fa-11f0-b741-177e3e2c2fc7.jpg,2025-10-09T18:06:04.334000+00:00,e28443421349de1ad84238c909f1962ac44ae67b
c132be14be97,Water bills to rise further for millions after appeal,,"Water bills to rise further for millions after appeal Faarea Masud Business reporter Getty Images Millions of households in England will have to pay higher water bills than previously announced after the UK's competition body agreed to let five water companies increase charges. The companies - Anglian, Northumbrian, Southern, Wessex and South East - had asked for permission to raise bills by more than the amount previously agreed by the regulator, Ofwat. They argued the rises set by Ofwat - which average 36% over the next five years – were not enough to deliver better infrastructure. A panel appointed by the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) has now said the bills can rise on average by an extra 3% - about £12 per year - partly due to the companies facing higher borrowing costs. An independent group of experts appointed by the CMA said that Anglian and Northumbrian could increase their bills by a further 1%, Southern by 3%, South East by 4% and Wessex by 5%. The five water companies serve more than 7 million household and business customers, and had asked for much larger increases to bills than the ones granted. The group appointed by the CMA said the firms had asked to increase bills to raise a total of £2.7bn in extra revenue, but it had allowed only 21% of this, equating to an additional £556m. ""We've found that water companies' requests for significant bill increases, on top of those allowed by Ofwat, are largely unjustified,"" said Kirstin Baker, who chaired the group of experts. ""We understand the real pressure on household budgets and have worked to keep increases to a minimum, while still ensuring there is funding to deliver essential improvements at reasonable cost."" The CMA's proposals are provisional and Ofwat and the water firms have a chance to respond before the CMA's final conclusion in a few months. Water companies finance much of their investment plans with borrowed money. The CMA said part of the reason it had allowed a rise was because interest rates on those loans have risen, making it more expensive for the firms to carry out their plans. Troubled firm Thames Water also appealed for higher price rises, but has deferred its case until late October while it tries to fix a rescue bid . Water firms have been told by authorities to fix outdated infrastructure which has been found to be the cause of much river and water pollution. The Environment Agency said serious pollution incidents by water firms went up by around 60% in a year. Water Minister Emma Hardy said she expected every water company to ""offer proper support to anyone struggling to pay"". Citizens Advice's Anne Pardoe said: ""Ramping up water bills, when people up and down the country are already rationing showers and cutting down on laundry, is going to stretch budgets beyond breaking point"". She called for the introduction of a national social tariff, in order to help people from low-income households pay for essential bills. Social tariffs are offered by some companies offering services such as broadband and energy, and allow those on benefits access to cheaper bills, although criteria differ from firm to firm. The CMA's findings will lead to an additional increase on average of ""£1 per household, per month"" for customers of the water firms that appealed, said David Henderson, chief executive of Water UK which represents water firms. When asked by the BBC's Today programme why the firms themselves could not pay for the needed upgrades, Mr Henderson said shareholders had already invested a lot of their own money, and eight water firms had made a loss in 2024. ""They [investors] don't have to put money into this sector, they don't even have to put money into this country,"" he said, adding that many ""haven't made a profit in years.

The King's Foundation says the feature-length TV film, provisionally titled Finding Harmony: A King's Vision, will be screened on Amazon's Prime Video early next year. ""Never has it been more important for the world to make a concerted effort to protect and prioritise our planet, and to restore our relationship with it,"" the monarch said about the project. In the film the King will reflect on his own decades of campaigning for sustainability. The King said it was his ""fondest hope that this film may encourage a new audience to learn about the philosophy of harmony - and perhaps inspire the same sense of determination it has given me to help build a more sustainable future"". The King has appeared in a behind-the-scenes BBC film about the Coronation, but this will be a more unusual approach in looking at his beliefs. ""For much of my life I have sought to promote and encourage ways we can work with, rather than against nature. In other words, to restore balance to our planet which is under such stress,"" said the King. The one-off documentary will show how he believes humans are ""part of nature, not apart from nature"" and that a healthy connection with nature is at ""the core of human wellbeing"". With examples from around the world, the documentary will show how the philosophy of harmony can be applied to agriculture, traditional craft skills, architecture and town planning. ""This film will, I hope, demonstrate just some of the remarkable work being done around the world to put harmony into practice, from the forests of Guyana to sustainable communities in India – and, closer to home, through the work of my King's Foundation at Dumfries House and Highgrove,"" said the King. King's Foundation The King heard from Indigenous peoples about the importance of living with nature Director Nicolas Brown said there was a gap in knowledge about how the King's views on harmony had shaped his work. ""Remarkably few people around the world know the full depth of the King's lifelong battle to bring nature and humanity into harmony,"" he said. Their cameras recorded the King's first harmony summit, held at Highgrove in Gloucestershire in July. This brought together leaders of Indigenous people from around the world who shared their knowledge of how communities could live in tune with the natural world. Along with the King, they performed a fire ceremony at the start of the day, paying their respects to nature. The King's views on harmony and the design of towns have also influenced thinking about creating a new generation of new towns in England .

The three scientists' work could tackle some of the biggest problems on our planet, including capturing carbon dioxide to help tackle climate change and reducing plastic pollution using chemistry. ""I'm deeply honoured and delighted, thank you very much,"" said Professor Kitagawa on the phone to a press conference after he was told the news. ""How long do I have to stay here? Because I have to go out for a meeting,"" he added. Professor Kitagawa works at Kyoto University in Japan, Professor Richard Robson is at University of Melbourne, Australia, and Professor Omar M Yaghi is at the University of California, US. The three winners will share prize money of 11 million Swedish kronor (£872,000). The scientists' work is about how molecules can be built together into structures - or metal-organic frameworks (MOFs). The Nobel committee called it ""molecular architecture"". The men worked out how to build constructions with large spaces between the molecules, through which gases and other chemicals can flow. These ""rooms"" can be used to capture and store chemicals that humans want to get rid of, including carbon dioxide in the atmosphere or so-called forever chemicals, also known as PFAS. The scientists began working independently on the structures in the 1970s and 1980s. Prof Robson asked his university to drill holes into the lab worktops so that wooden balls - representing atoms - could be attached to wooden rods, representing chemical bonds. So far MOFs have only been used on a small-scale, but companies are looking into whether they can be mass-produced. One potential application is to break down harmful gases, including those used in nuclear weapons. Companies are also testing whether they can be used to capture the planet-warming gas carbon dioxide from power stations and factories. Professor Robson, who was born in North Yorkshire but has been based at the University of Melbourne since 1966, told BBC Newshour that the news ""wasn't a big surprise [because of] all sorts of sounds I've been hearing over the years"". When asked about the potential applications of his work he urged caution:  ""There's talk about binding CO2 and solving the world's atmospheric problems, which don't sound realistic to me - but these sorts of compounds could do that sort of job on a small scale"". The 88-year-old professor admits the prize money ""is the main thing actually in my head. It wasn't the driving force for all of this but at this stage in my life that's a very nice thought to have"". The award is another indicator of the value of chemistry in addressing some of the planet's hardest problems. ""Every year we see Nobel Prizes given to chemists who welcome the challenge of finding solutions to the biggest problems our global society faces – better healthcare, environmental protection, clean energy, and secure food and water for everyone,"" said Dr Annette Doherty, president of the Royal Society of Chemistry in Britain. The announcement was made by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences at a news conference in Stockholm, Sweden. Professor Kitagawa was motivated by the principle of ""the usefulness of useless"", according to the Nobel committee. It reflected the philosophy of an ancient Chinese philosopher, Zhuangzi, who said that even if something did not bring immediate benefit, it could still turn out to be valuable. Professor Yaghi was born in Amman, Jordan and raised in a single room with his siblings without electricity or running water, according to the Nobel committee. He became captivated by molecular structures one day at school, and aged 15, he went to the US to study. It is the third science prize awarded this week. On Tuesday John Clarke, Michel H. Devoret and John M. Martinis won the Physics Nobel for their work on quantum mechanics that paved the way for the quantum computer.

Devoret and John M. Martinis for their work on quantum mechanics that is paving the way for a new generation of very powerful computers. ""There is no advanced technology used today that does not rely on quantum mechanics, including mobile phones, cameras... and fibre optic cables,"" said the Nobel committee. The announcement was made by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences at a news conference in Stockholm, Sweden. ""To put it mildly, it was a surprise of my life,"" said Professor John Clarke, who was born in Cambridge, UK and now works at the University of California in Berkeley. Michel H. Devoret was born in Paris, France and is a professor at Yale University while John M. Martinis is a professor at University of California, Santa Barbara. The three winners will share prize money of 11 million Swedish kronor (£872,000). The Nobel committee recognised breakthrough work performed by the three men in a series of experiments in the 1980s on electrical circuits. In the words of the committee, ""the discovery of macroscopic quantum mechanical tunnelling and energy quantisation in an electric circuit"". Even for a field often considered dense, this discovery sounds bewildering. Getty Images But its implications have been profound and far-reaching. The electronic devices that most of us use rely on it, and the findings are being used to build extremely powerful computers. ""This is something that leads to development of the quantum computer. Many people are working on quantum computing, our discovery is in many ways the basis of this,"" said Prof Clarke on the phone to the news conference moments after he was told he had won. He appeared mystified that his work completed forty years ago is worthy of science's most prestigious prize. ""I'm completely stunned. At the time we did not realise in any way that this might be the basis for a Nobel prize,"" he said. Quantum mechanics relates to the behaviour of tiny things in a tiny world. It refers to what particles like the electron do in the sub-atomic world. Professor Clarke and his team looked at how these particles appeared to break rules like travelling through energy barriers that conventional physics said was impossible - something called ""tunnelling"". Using quantum ""tunnelling"", the electron manages to burrow through the energy barrier. Their work demonstrated that tunnelling can be reproduced not only in the quantum world, but also in electrical circuits in the 'real world'. This knowledge has been harnessed by scientists in making modern quantum chips. ""This is wonderful news indeed, and very well deserved,"" said Professor Lesley Cohen, Associate Provost in the Department of Physics at Imperial College London. ""Their work has laid the foundations for superconducting Qubits - one of the main hardware technologies for quantum technologies.""

b10735d65807,The before and after images showing glaciers vanishing before our eyes,,"The before and after images showing glaciers vanishing before our eyes Mark Poynting Climate and science reporter, BBC News BBC When Matthias Huss first visited Rhône Glacier in Switzerland 35 years ago, the ice was just a short walk from where his parents would park the car. ""When I first stepped onto the ice... there [was] a special feeling of eternity,"" says Matthias. Today, the ice is half an hour from the same parking spot and the scene is very different. ""Every time I go back, I remember how it used to be,"" recalls Matthias, now director of Glacier Monitoring in Switzerland (GLAMOS), ""how the glacier looked when I was a child."" There are similar stories for many glaciers all over the planet, because these frozen rivers of ice are retreating - fast. In 2024, glaciers outside the giant ice sheets of Greenland and Antarctica lost 450 billion tonnes of ice, according to a recent World Meteorological Organization report. That's equivalent to a block of ice 7km (4.3 miles) tall, 7km wide and 10km deep - enough water to fill 180 million Olympic swimming pools. ""Glaciers are melting everywhere in the world,"" says Prof Ben Marzeion of the Institute of Geography at the University of Bremen. ""They are sitting in a climate that is very hostile to them now because of global warming."" Switzerland's glaciers have been particularly badly hit, losing a quarter of their ice in the last 10 years, measurements from GLAMOS revealed this week. ""It's really difficult to grasp the extent of this melt,"" explains Dr Huss. But photos - from space and the ground - tell their own story. Satellite images show how the Rhône Glacier has changed since 1990, when Dr Huss first visited. At the front of the glacier is a lake where there used to be ice. Until recently, glaciologists in the Alps used to consider 2% of ice lost in a single year to be ""extreme"". Then 2022 blew that idea out of the water, with nearly 6% of Switzerland's remaining ice lost in a single year. That has been followed by significant losses in 2023, 2024 and now 2025 too. Regine Hock, professor of glaciology at the University of Oslo, has been visiting the Alps since the 1970s. The changes over her lifetime are ""really stunning"", she says, but ""what we see now is really massive changes within a few years"". The Clariden Glacier, in north-eastern Switzerland, was roughly in balance until the late 20th Century - gaining about as much ice through snowfall as it lost to melting. But this century, it's melted rapidly. For many smaller glaciers, like the Pizol Glacier in the north-east Swiss Alps, it's been too much. ""This is one of the glaciers that I observed, and now it's completely gone,"" says Dr Huss. ""It definitely makes me sad."" Photographs allow us to look even further back in time. The Gries Glacier, in southern Switzerland near the Italian border, has retreated by about 2.2km (1.4 miles) in the past century. Where the end of the glacier once stood is now a large glacial lake. In south-east Switzerland, the Pers Glacier once fed the larger Morteratsch Glacier, which flows down towards the valley. Now the two no longer meet. And the largest glacier in the Alps, the Great Aletsch, has receded by about 2.3km (1.4 miles) over the past 75 years. Where there was ice, there are now trees. Glaciers have grown and shrunk naturally for millions of years, of course. In the cold snaps of the 17th, 18th and 19th Centuries - part of the Little Ice Age - glaciers regularly advanced. During this time, many were considered cursed by the devil in Alpine folklore, their advances linked to spiritual forces as they threatened hamlets and farmland. There are even tales of villagers calling on priests to talk to the spirits of glaciers and get them to move up the mountain. Glaciers began their widespread retreat across the Alps in about 1850, though the timing varied from place to place. That coincided with rising industrialisation, when burning of fossil fuels, particularly coal, began to heat up our atmosphere, but it's hard to disentangle natural and human causes that far back in time. Where there is no real doubt is that the particularly rapid losses of the past 40 years or so are not natural. Without humans warming the planet - by burning fossil fuels and releasing huge amounts of carbon dioxide (CO2) – glaciers would be expected to be roughly stable. ""We can only explain it if we take into account CO2 emissions,"" confirms Prof Marzeion. What is even more sobering is that these large, flowing bodies of ice can take decades to fully adjust to the rapidly warming climate. That means that, even if global temperatures stabilised tomorrow, glaciers would continue to retreat. ""A large part of the future melt of the glaciers is already locked in,"" explains Prof Marzeion. ""They are lagging climate change."" But all is not lost. Half of the ice remaining across the world's mountain glaciers could be preserved if global warming is limited to 1.5C above ""pre-industrial"" levels of the late 1800s, according to research published this year in the journal Science . Our current trajectory is leading us towards warming of about 2.7C above pre-industrial levels by the end of this century – which would see three-quarters of ice lost eventually. That extra water going into rivers and eventually the oceans means higher sea levels for coastal populations around the world. But the loss of ice will be particularly acutely felt by mountain communities dependent on glaciers for fresh water. Glaciers are a bit like giant reservoirs. They collect water as snowfall - which turns into ice - during cold, wet periods, and release it as meltwater during warm periods. This meltwater helps to stabilise river flows during hot, dry summers - until the glacier disappears. The loss of that water resource has knock-on effects for all those who rely on glaciers - for irrigation, drinking, hydropower and even shipping traffic. Switzerland is not immune from those challenges, but the implications are much more profound for the high mountains of Asia, referred to by some as the Third Pole due to the volume of ice. About 800 million people rely at least partly on meltwater from glaciers there, particularly for agriculture. That includes the upper Indus river basin, which serves parts of China, India, Pakistan, and Afghanistan. In regions with drier summers, meltwater from ice and snow can be the only significant source of water for months. ""That's where we see the biggest vulnerability,"" says Prof Hock. So how do scientists feel when confronted by the future prospects of glaciers in a warming world? ""It's sad,"" says Prof Hock. ""But at the same time, it's also empowering. If you decarbonise and reduce the [carbon] footprint, you can preserve glaciers. ""We have it in our hands."" Top image: Tschierva Glacier, Swiss Alps, in 1935 and 2022.

Prince William will travel to Rio de Janeiro next month for the ceremony - the first time the awards have been hosted in Latin America. The prize, created by the prince five years ago, awards £1m every year to five projects for their environmental innovations. There have been almost 2,500 nominees this year from 72 countries - this year's winners will be chosen by Prince William and his Earthshot Prize Council which includes the actor, Cate Blanchett and Jordan's Queen Rania. This year's list of finalists range from a Caribbean country to small start-up businesses. The Earthshot Prize is a 10-year project with past ceremonies held in London, Boston, Singapore and Cape Town. Kensington Palace confirmed earlier this year that the main awards ceremony will be held at Rio de Janeiro's Museum of Tomorrow on 5 November. Barbados has been nominated for its global leadership on climate with the island on track to become fossil-free by 2030. The Chinese city of Guangzhou is shortlisted in the ""Clean our Air"" category for electrification of its public transport system. Prince William previously said he would like to take the Earthshot Prize to China. Finally, what has been billed as the world's first fully ""upcycled skyscraper"" makes the final list too. Sydney's Quay Quarter Tower was one of thousands of 20th century towers now reaching the end of their lifespans. Instead of demolition, which releases vast amounts of carbon and waste, a coalition of architects, engineers, building contractors and developers has effectively ""upcycled"" the original structure. ""Matter"" is the only British finalist in the line-up. Based in Bristol, the business has developed a filter for washing machines removing the greatest cause of microplastics in our oceans. ""I feel like winning an Earthshot prize for me would be like winning an Olympic gold medal,"" said Adam Root, the founder of Matter. Reuters In 2024, Actor Billy Porter and Earthshot ambassadors Robert Irwin and Nomzamo Mbatha joined the Prince of Wales on stage at the awards In a video message released to mark the announcement of this year's finalists, he reflected on the past five years. ""Back then, a decade felt a long time. George was seven, Charlotte, five, and Louis two; the thought of them in 2030 felt a lifetime away,"" said Prince William. ""But today, as we stand halfway through this critical decade, 2030 feels very real. ""2030 is a threshold by which future generations will judge us; it is the point at which our actions, or lack of them, will have shaped forever the trajectory of our planet."" He added: ""The people behind these projects are heroes of our time, so let us back them. Because, if we do, we can make the world cleaner, safer and full of opportunity - not only for future generations, but for the lives we want to lead now."" The Earthshot Prize is now one of the key pieces of Prince William's public work. ""He has been able to build an unprecedented network of organisations,"" Jason Knauf, the new CEO of the Earthshot Prize, said. ""The philanthropists working together, the corporates that come together as part of the Earthshot prize community, the leaders who get involved. ""There's never been a group of people working together on a single environment project in the way they have with the Earthshot Prize.

90984706df14,Dame Jane Goodall revolutionised our understanding of our closest primate cousins,,"Dame Jane Goodall revolutionised our understanding of our closest primate cousins Victoria Gill Science correspondent Watch: Jane Goodall tells BBC how she became interested in animals She was a serene force of nature. And she never wavered in her mission to help the animals to which she dedicated her life. When I interviewed Dame Jane Goodall last year, she exuded calm, even as she pressed home to me that a great extinction crisis was facing our planet. Over a slightly blurry video call, I could see her toy monkey, Mr H, behind her. That toy was given to her nearly 30 years ago by a friend. Dr Goodall, who was 90 years old when we spoke, was still travelling the world with Mr H at her side. Researchers I've spoken to this evening, whose work Dr Goodall inspired, or who were simply inspired by her energy, are in shock at her death aged 91. Professor Cat Hobaiter, from the University of St Andrews, who has worked with Chimpanzees - studying their communication - for more than 15 years, told me that one reason Dr Goodall had such an impact was that ""she gave up doing what she loved - spending time with her beloved chimpanzees - to tirelessly travel the world and share her passion with everyone she met."" In the many years that Jane Goodall observed and studied chimpanzees, she revolutionised our understanding of our closest primate cousins. Key to her groundbreaking discoveries were her curiosity and ability - quietly - to observe. Getty Images Dr Goodall ""gave up doing what she loved... to tirelessly travel the world and share her passion"" It was during her time in the rainforest reserve at Gombe, in Tanzania, when she stopped to spend time watching a male chimpanzee who was foraging. The chimp took a twig, bent and stripped it of its leaves, then he poked it into a termite's nest. He then used that stripped, bent twig to spoon the termites into his mouth. That observation - in 1960 - challenged the belief that only humans made and used tools. Even as she changed our understanding of the natural world, Dr Goodall faced cynicism and sexism. She was not formally trained as a scientist. And, in the 1960s, that was unusual. Her work in Gombe went on to show that chimps also form strong family bonds - and even that they engage in warfare over territory. But her approach – associating so closely with the animals she studied, naming them and even referring to them as ""my friends"" - made her unpopular with the male-dominated scientific establishment. Her supervisor and mentor, Professor Louis Leakey, saw the value in that informality. ""He wanted somebody whose mind wasn't messed up by the reductionist attitude of science to animals,"" she said. Getty Images Dr Goodall was still travelling the world into her 90s with her toy monkey, Mr H, at her side Now, the scientific establishment is reeling from the loss of a great scientist. Adrian Smith, president of the Royal Society, described her as ""an amazing scientist who inspired people to see the natural world in a new way"". Roger Highfield, from the Science Museum in London, which awarded Dr Goodall a fellowship earlier this year, called her an ""inspiration"". ""She was formidable and it's incredibly shocking news, because she completely changed how we think about other species and how we think about ourselves - she challenged human exceptionalism,"" he said. Jane Goodall eventually turned her focus from her chimpanzees to spreading the word about protecting nature. When she spoke to me for BBC Inside Science in 2024 , she was promoting a tree-planting and habitat restoration mission that her eponymous foundation was carrying out in Uganda. ""We still have a window of time to slow down climate change and loss of biodiversity,"" she said at the time. ""But it's a window that's closing."" Prof Hobaiter, one of the many scientists Dr Goodall inspired, told me: ""Jane would be the first person to tell us that what the world needs right now is not sadness over her loss, but to get to work. ""We all have a lot to be getting on with to make sure that we are not the last generation to live alongside wild chimpanzees.""",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cgj1pz8q63go,Science,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/d9f8/live/de46afc0-9f06-11f0-92db-77261a15b9d2.jpg,2025-10-01T20:53:35.157000+00:00,78c32b140229cb1f927fe5965e0260734bff63e1

The Prince of Wales said she inspired him personally and ""her boundless curiosity, compassion and pioneering spirit transformed our understanding of the natural world"". Dr Goodall died of natural causes while in California on a speaking tour of the US, according to a statement from the Jane Goodall Institute. It said her discoveries ""revolutionised science"" and that she advocated ""for the protection and restoration of our natural world"".

Jane Goodall made a difference."" Many other public figures as well as global organisations have praised Dr Goodall's legacy. Former US president Barack Obama said Dr Goodall ""opened doors for generations of women in science"", while actor and environmental campaigner Leonardo DiCaprio said she ""inspired millions to care, to act, and to hope"", and called her ""a true hero for the planet"". The United Nations said it mourned the loss of Dr Goodall, saying that she ""worked tirelessly for our planet and all its inhabitants, leaving an extraordinary legacy for humanity and nature"". Greenpeace said it was ""heartbroken"" by her death, calling her ""one of the true conservation giants of our time"".

Naturalist Chris Packham told the BBC that he counted her among his heroes, calling her ""revolutionary"" and ""remarkable"". ""To have lost a hero at a time when we need all of them on the frontline fighting for life on earth is a tragedy."" Getty Images Dr Jane Goodall observing a chimpanzee in Tanzania in 1987 Born in 1934 and raised in London, Dr Goodall said she became fascinated by animals after reading books like The Story of Dr Doolittle and Tarzan. She met leading primatologist Prof Louis Leakey while staying on a friend's farm in Kenya in her mid-twenties.  Although she had no qualifications, Mr Leakey saw her potential and helped arrange her first research trip to the jungles of Tanzania in 1960. That year, she became the first person to record witnessing an animal using a tool - a large male chimpanzee, who she had named David Greybeard, digging termites out of a mound with a stick. Until then, it was thought only humans were intelligent enough to do so. Her observations challenged years of conventional scientific thinking and shaped the future of evolutionary science. Her work was published in leading journals, and in 1965 she made the front cover of National Geographic, introducing the world to the emotional and social lives of the primates. Getty Images She featured in 'Miss Goodall and the World of Chimpanzees', narrated by Orson Welles and first broadcast in 1965 She revealed that the animals form strong family bonds and even engage in warfare over territory. She featured in a television documentary narrated by Orson Welles, which saw her playing and wrestling with baby chimps. Her approach - associating so closely with the animals she studied, naming them and even referring to them as ""my friends"" - was scoffed at by some, mostly male, scientists at the time. She undertook a PhD based on her findings, despite not having an undergraduate degree or any prior scientific training. After her experiences in the field she became an activist, working to free chimpanzees kept in zoos or in captivity for medical research, and later urged action on climate change in the face of widespread habitat devastation. She told the BBC in 2024 : ""We're in the midst of the sixth great extinction... the more we can do to restore nature and protect existing forests, the better."" Asked what kept her motivated late in life, she said: ""Surely people want a future for their children."" Getty Images Alongside her work with chimpanzees, Dr Goodall also advocated for the protection of orangutans and other great apes Her Jane Goodall Institute, founded in 1977, works to protect chimpanzees and supports projects aimed at benefiting animals and the environment. Dr Goodall was appointed a Dame in 2003 and received the US Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2025. She was known for travelling constantly for her work, telling the Times newspaper in 2022 that she had not slept in the same bed for more than three weeks since 1986. Dr Goodall worked right up until her death, being interviewed on stage in New York  a week ago. She was due to speak again at a sold-out event on 3 October in California. PA Media Tributes have poured in for Dame Jane from across the globe, praising her advocacy and ""compassion"" The Duke and Duchess of Sussex joined the many honouring the legacy of Dr Goodall, describing her as a ""tireless advocate"" for the protection of nature.

Reiterating the words of his predecessor Pope Francis, the new pontiff lambasted critics who ""ridicule those who speak of global warming"". The Pope's remarks, at a speech in Castel Gondolfo near Rome, will be seen as an implied criticism of US President Donald Trump, who last month called climate change a ""con"". Pope Leo also called for greater action from citizens the world over on climate change, saying there was no room for indifference or resignation. The Pope was speaking at a conference to mark 10 years since the publication of Laudato Si'. That landmark document , written by his predecessor Pope Francis, made the issue of climate a central part of the church's concerns. Many credit it for helping set the tone that led to the Paris climate agreement in 2015. But the new Pope, who was elected in May, was worried that the question of climate change was now becoming more divisive. Referring to his predecessor's writings, he said: ""Some have chosen to deride the increasingly evident signs of climate change, to ridicule those who speak of global warming, and even to blame the poor for the very thing that affects them the most."" Just two weeks ago at the UN General Assembly in New York, US President Donald Trump criticised the climate movement as the ""greatest con job ever perpetrated on the world"", and rebuffed the use of renewable energy. ""The carbon footprint is a hoax made up by people with evil intentions, and they're heading down a path of total destruction,"" he said. Pope Leo, the first pontiff born in the US, has previously clashed with Trump's White House on issues including migration and national security. Getty Images Pope Leo told the meeting that citizens needed to put more pressure on politicians over climate change In Wednesday's speech, the Pope called for people all over the world to put increased pressure on politicians. Citizens need to take an active role in political decisions, he said, as ""only then will it be possible to mitigate the damage done to the environment"". The Pope said that each of us will have to answer a question from God. ""God will ask us if we have cultivated and cared for the world that he created for the benefit of all and for future generations, and if we have taken care of our brothers and sisters - what will be our answer, my dear friends?"" The Raising Hope conference was held just over a month from the start of COP30 in Belém, in Brazil.

""We could never have contemplated this would grow here,"" says farmer Sarah Taylor, whose land the rice is planted  on. ""Not in a million years,"" her husband Craig adds. This young crop is part of an ambitious trial to see what foods Britain could grow in the future. The trial is trying to answer big questions about how we can produce enough food and protect farmer's livelihoods in a world being altered by climate change. The BBC got a sneak peek at the rice plants before harvest. Rice plants look a lot like thick grass. But running up the stalks there are small beads - these are the rice grains. They were still brown when we visited, but will be picked when they turn white. Nadine, an award-winning ecologist, is incredibly proud. Gwyndaf Hughes/BBC The UK's first rice paddy field - where nine varieties of the crop have been grown this year ""I'm actually amazed because they are big, happy, bushy plants,"" she says, warning me not to fall over when we step into the calf-deep water. She points out her favourites. ""This is Estrella from Colombia, the best one so far,"" she says. ""But I'm least impressed with this,"" she says, gesturing to a Japanese rice that has not flowered. This experiment is the brainchild of the UK Centre for Ecology and Hydrology (UKCEH), in partnership with Craig and Sarah Taylor. Dozens of plants were planted in four mini paddy fields dug out and flooded on the Taylors' farm a few miles north of Ely in Cambridgeshire. We often think of rice as a tropical plant, but it does grow in colder climates. Nine varieties are growing, including from Brazil, Colombia, Italy and the Philippines. They include the stars of the rice world - risotto, basmati and sushi. The plants did well in the hot, sunny summer, which the Met Office says was the hottest in the UK since records began in 1884. ""Nobody has tried this before, but with climate change, we have crops that, 10 years ago, we wouldn't have thought would be viable. In 10 years time, rice could be a completely perfect crop for us,"" Nadine says. This is the very edge of where rice can grow at the moment and it would be a risky crop for farmers to plant commercially, says Prof Richard Pywell who is leading the project for UKCEH. But Britain's climate is changing quickly. If annual average temperatures warm by between 2 and 4C compared to pre-industrial levels - a scenario that many scientists say is likely - rice could be grown widely in the UK, according to research. Gwyndaf Hughes/BBC The rice is part of a bigger trial looking at the future of agriculture in the UK But this project is about more than growing British rice for our dinner plates. It could also help the UK tackle climate change. The land in the Fens is some of the most productive in the UK. A third of the vegetables grown in Britain come from here, with a value of around £1.2bn per year. But this has a significant cost for the environment and climate. The farms are on rich peat soil that used to be underwater but is now slowly drying out. That is releasing carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, contributing to climate change. Nationally, peat soils account for 3% of our greenhouse gas emissions. That is also degrading the quality of the soil, a change seen in real time by farmers like Craig and Sarah. They feel deeply connected to the land and its history. ""All my ancestors were Fenmen. I love this place, we've been here for 500 plus years,"" says Craig. The rice field is surrounded by potato, onion and beet crops, which are still the thriving staples here. Digging a healthy clump of potatoes from the rich, black soil, Craig says, ""potatoes are an amazing crop. You can't knock that, but we know things need to change."" ""We don't want people thinking we're the 'crazy rice farmers' - this is about rethinking the whole system and making it work for everyone,"" he says. Unpredictable weather patterns in recent years have hit farmers nationally, affecting harvests and crop yields in some cases. ""We see that the future isn't stable. We want to be able to write our own destiny and not have it decided for us,"" says Sarah. ""Our legacy for our children and hopefully their children is really important to us and I want them to know that we at least try to make a difference,"" she says. Gwyndaf Hughes/BBC Craig and Sarah Taylor's families have farmed in Cambridgeshire for generations As well as rice, the team are trialling other crops including lettuce and hybrid willow that grow in waterlogged conditions. By flooding the peat soils in parts of Cambridgeshire, greenhouse gases could stay locked in the wet soil, cutting off that source of greenhouse gas emissions. Even though growing rice produces methane, which is a potent greenhouse gas, initial results from the trials so far suggest the rice crop is not producing more emissions than it helps lock away. The government is interested in what happens here too, and officials from the Department for Environment Food and Rural Affairs have visited the site. It could be a radical breakthrough in one of the thorniest questions in the UK - how to protect farming and food supplies, while also addressing the huge impacts they have on the environment and climate. The UK food system, including imports, is equivalent to 38% of UK greenhouse gas emissions, while agriculture accounts for 11.7%. Growing rice on peat soils won't fix that overnight, but it could provide a model. ""We're at a critical juncture in climate change and we need to make decisions. We need to understand what sort of crops we could be potentially growing in the future,"" explains Richard from UKCEH. Gwyndaf Hughes/BBC Rice varieties including risotto and basmati are growing in the trial in Cambridgeshire ""It's possible that for certain areas, peatland re-wetting and growing rice may be a viable option. In other areas, we may continue to grow our conventional crops, but under different conditions,"" he says. Growing rice domestically sounds simple, but this is a complicated project with big ambitions. It will still be some time before we can test taste a UK rice crop - but it's a very real possibility that in the next decade, UK-grown rice could be coming to our dinner plates.

b8423fa96c7d,"Environment Agency failed to visit serious pollution incidents, files show",,"Environment Agency failed to visit serious pollution incidents, files show Jonah Fisher Environment correspondent Getty Images Serious pollution incidents are those which have an impact on the environment, people or property. Documents and data shared with BBC News from inside England's much criticised environment watchdog show an agency struggling to monitor incidents of serious pollution. The information shows the Environment Agency (EA) only sent investigators to a small fraction of reported incidents last year and often relied on water companies - who may be responsible for the pollution - for updates. An internal EA document from this year states that all potentially serious incidents should be attended by staff. But in 2024, the EA didn't go to almost a third of nearly 100 water industry incidents that were eventually ruled to have posed a serious threat to nature or human health. The agency also downgraded the environmental impact of more than 1,000 incidents that it initially decided were potentially serious without sending anyone to take a look. The EA says it does ""respond"" to all incidents but has ways to assess pollution that don't involve going in person. It says when reports come in it is ""careful not to underestimate the seriousness of an incident report"". But the EA insider who provided the BBC with the data was critical of the agency. ""What not attending means is that you are you are basically only dealing with water company evidence. And it's very rare that their own evidence is very damning,"" the insider said. Among the incident reports shared with the BBC were an occasion when a chemical spilled into a reservoir killing all its fish and which the EA did not attend.  Another time, sewage bubbled up into a garden for more than 24 hours with no deployment from the EA. The BBC is not printing specific details from the reports to protect the identity of the whistleblower. But they show an agency often slow to respond and frequently copying water company updates into EA documents verbatim before downgrading incidents. Other documents show pollution incidents that were reported to the EA by water companies hours after the problem had already been solved, making the impact much harder to assess as the evidence may have washed away. The data show that overall the agency went to just 13% of all the pollution incidents, serious and more limited, that were reported to it in 2024. Jonah Fisher/BBC Ashley Smith from the campaign group Windrush Against Sewage Pollution (WASP) says its ""virtually impossible"" to get the Environment Agency to come out. ""It's virtually impossible to get them to come out,"" Ashley Smith a veteran water quality campaigner from the Oxfordshire based campaign group Windrush Against Sewage Pollution (WASP) told the BBC. ""(When you call the EA) they go through a scenario where they'll say 'are there any dead fish'. And, typically there are not dead fish because often the fish are able to escape. ""The EA then says – we'll report that to Thames Water – and it will be Thames Water if anyone who gets in touch with you."" Jonah Fisher/BBC Matt Staniek (front row) is leading a campaign to get Windermere in the Lake District cleaned up Matt Staniek is a water quality campaigner in the Lake District and cited several incidents where he says the EA took explanations from the local water company about sewage spills at face value, which later through his own data requests were proved wrong. ""The Environment Agency has not been holding United Utilities accountable,"" he says. ""And the only way that we get them to properly turn up to pollution incidents and now actually try and do a proper investigation is by going to the media with it, and that should not be the case."" A United Utilities spokesperson responded saying ""we are industry leading at self-reporting incidents to the Environment Agency"". As part of the government's landmark review of water industry regulation it has promised to end ""self reporting"" of incidents by water companies. There is widespread agreement that the current system is not working and plans are being drawn up to merge the regulators – including the EA - which oversee different parts of the water industry – into just one. ""The Environment Agency is so hollowed out that it cannot investigate pollution crimes, effectively telling polluters they can act with impunity,"" James Wallace, the chief executive of campaign group River Action, told the BBC. In July the BBC revealed that staff shortages had led to the EA cancelling thousands of water quality tests at its main laboratory in Devon. ""We respond to every water pollution incident report we receive,"" an Environment Agency spokesperson said. ""To make sure we protect people and the environment, we are careful not to underestimate the seriousness of an incident report when it comes in. Final incident categorisations may change when further information comes to light. This is all part of our standard working practice."" The EA says in the next year it's aiming to more than double the number of water company inspections it carries out. To do that the agency says it's in the process of recruiting five hundred more staff and improving the way it handles data.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy4jk8njpngo,Science,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/b78a/live/381897e0-9555-11f0-a9d0-b91ec0b66439.jpg,2025-09-25T01:07:14.491000+00:00,eaece8dc2590c700b0f70bdae6ce4b03710b466c
a03fb30bdf7f,"America's blame game over Canada's wildfire smoke misses the point, experts say",,"America's blame game over Canada's wildfire smoke misses the point, experts say Nadine Yousif Senior Canada reporter Getty Images Smoke from Canada's wildfires have drifted south to the US several times this summer, clouding the sky with an orange haze. As deadly wildfires raged in the Canadian province of Manitoba this summer, Republican lawmakers in nearby US states penned letters asking that Canada be held accountable for the smoke drifting south. ""Our skies are being choked by wildfire smoke we didn't start and can't control,"" wrote Calvin Callahan, a Republican state representative from Wisconsin, in a letter dated early August. Callahan, along with lawmakers from Iowa, Minnesota and North Dakota, filed a formal complaint with the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) urging an investigation into Canada's wildfire management. Manitoba premier Wab Kinew quickly condemned the move, accusing the lawmakers of throwing a ""timber tantrum"" and playing ""political games"". By August, the wildfires had scorched more than two million acres in Manitoba, forced thousands to evacuate, and killed two people – a married couple who authorities said were trapped by fast-moving flames around their family home. As September draws to a close, data shows that 2025 is on track to be Canada's second-worst wildfire season on record. A study published in the Nature journal in September has revealed that smoke from Canada's wildfires has also had far-reaching, fatal consequences. It estimates that the 2023 wildfires - the country's worst on record by area burned - caused more than 87,500 acute and premature deaths worldwide, including 4,100 acute, smoke-related deaths in the US and over 22,000 premature deaths in Europe. Wildfire smoke contains PM2.5 - a type of air pollution - that is known to trigger inflammation in the body. It can exacerbate conditions like asthma and heart disease, and, in some causes, can damage neural connections in the brain. ""These are big numbers,"" said Michael Brauer, a professor at the University of British Columbia who co-authored the study. He added the findings show wildfire smoke should be treated as a serious health issue, akin to breast cancer or prostate cancer. For some American lawmakers, the blame falls squarely on Canada. ""Canada's failure to contain massive wildfires,"" Callahan wrote in August, ""has harmed the health and quality of life of more than 20 million Americans in the Midwest."" Their complaints raise the question: Could Canada be doing more to curb its wildfires – and by extension, their smoke? Climate and fire experts in both countries told the BBC that the answer is largely no. ""Until we as a global society deal with human-cased climate change, we're going to have this problem,"" said Mike Flannigan, an emergency management and fire science expert at Thompson Rivers University in British Columbia. Gallo Images/Orbital Horizon/Copernicus Sentinel Data 2025 Wildfire smoke can often travel thousands of miles. A satellite image here from August shows smoke from a fire in Newfoundland drifting over the Atlantic Ocean. Metrics show Canada's wildfires, a natural part of its vast boreal forest, have worsened in recent years. Fire season now starts earlier, ends later, and burns more land on average. The 2023 fires razed 15 million hectares (37 million acres) – an area larger than England – while the 2025 blazes have so far burned 8.7 million hectares (21.5 million acres). As of mid-September, there are still more than 500 fires burning, mostly in British Columbia and Manitoba, according to the Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre. Roughly half of Canada's wildfires are sparked by lightning, while the rest stem from human activity, data from the National Forestry Database shows. Experts warn that hotter temperatures are making the land drier and more prone to ignition. Wildfires are not only worsening in Canada. The US has recently seen some of its most damaging blazes, including the 2023 Hawaii wildfires that killed at least 102 people, and the Palisades fire in January, the most destructive in Los Angeles history. Both countries have struggled to keep pace, often sharing firefighting resources. Canadian water bombers were deployed in California this year, while more than 600 US firefighters travelled north to assist Canada, according to the US Forest Service. In Canada, strained resources – and worsening fires – have fuelled calls for a national firefighting service. Wildfire emergency response is currently handled separately by each of the provinces and territories. ""The system we have right now worked 40 years ago. Today? Not so much,"" argued Mr Flannigan. Others propose controlled burns, a practice used in Australia and by indigenous communities, as a solution, though these fires would still generate smoke. Some argue for better clearing of flammable material in forests and near towns, or investing in new technology that can help detect wildfires faster. Some of that work is already underway. In August, Canada pledged more than $47m for research projects to help communities better prepare for and mitigate wildfires. Getty Images Major Canadian cities, like Vancouver, have also been dealing with wildfire smoke. Still, experts like Jen Beverly, a wildland fire professor at the University of Alberta, warn there is little Canada can do to prevent wildfires altogether. ""These are high intensity fire ecosystems"" in Canada, she said, that are different from fires in Australia or the US. ""We have very difficult fires to manage under extreme conditions, and we're seeing more of those because of climate change."" With a warmer climate, Prof Beverly said attention should be paid to pollution. She noted that the US is the second-worst carbon emitter in the world behind China. ""I mean, we should be blaming them for the problem,"" she argued. In recent months, the Trump administration has also rolled back environmental policies designed to reduce emissions, and has withdrawn the US from the Paris climate accords. Sheila Olmstead, an enviromental policy professor at Cornell University, noted that Canada and the US have a history of cooperation on pollution and climate, including an air quality agreement signed by the two in 1991 to address acid rain. ""It was a very clear framework for addressing the problem, and that's what seems to be missing here,"" Olmstead told the BBC. Both countries, she said, would benefit from working together on wildfires instead of trading blame. As for the EPA complaint, it is unclear what the agency could do to address the US lawmakers' concerns. In a statement to the BBC, the EPA said it is reviewing it ""and will respond through appropriate channels"". Prof Brauer said the data in his study shows that even though the fires are burning in Canada - often in remote areas - their impact can reach far beyond. The findings, he told the BBC, call for a re-framing of how the consequences of climate change are understood. ""The effects of a warmer climate are localised, and there are winners and losers,"" Prof Brauer said. ""But this is an illustration that some of these impacts are becoming global."" He argued that the US lawmakers' complaints are an ""unfortunate distraction,"" and that the focus should instead be on collaboration and learning how to ""live with smoke"". ""This stuff isn't going away,"" Prof Brauer said, adding that there are ways to prevent future deaths if there is a will to adapt.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn4l3j93481o,Science,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/b63d/live/cad5cb80-9595-11f0-b72b-7959ebab31f0.jpg,2025-09-25T01:17:33.301000+00:00,282a2d008321ce498cc92217bcab0db728cbd0d4
15183877186b,China makes landmark pledge to cut its climate emissions,,"China makes landmark pledge to cut its climate emissions Mark Poynting and Matt McGrath BBC News Climate and Science European Photopress Agency China, the world's biggest source of planet-warming gases, has for the first time committed to an absolute target to cut its emissions. In a video statement to the UN in New York, President Xi Jinping said that China would reduce its greenhouse gas emissions across the economy by 7-10% by 2035, while ""striving to do better"". The announcement comes at a time the US is rolling back on its commitments, with President Donald Trump on Tuesday calling climate change a ""con job"". But some critics said China's plan did not go as far as hoped to keep global climate goals in reach. ""Even for those with tempered expectations, what's presented today still falls short,"" said Yao Zhe, global policy adviser at Greenpeace East Asia. While the year's big gathering of global leaders will be at COP30 in Brazil in November, this week's UN meeting in New York has extra relevance because countries are running out of time to submit their new climate plans. These pledges - submitted every five years - are a key part of the Paris climate agreement , the landmark deal in which nearly 200 countries agreed steps to try to limit global warming. The original deadline for these new commitments - covering emissions cuts by 2035 - was back in February, but countries are now scrambling to present them by the end of September. Speaking before the meeting UN Secretary-General António Guterres said the pledges were critical to keep the long-term rise in global temperatures under 1.5C, as agreed in Paris. ""We absolutely need countries to come [...] with climate action plans that are fully aligned with 1.5 degrees, that cover the whole of their economies and the whole of their greenhouse gas emissions,"" he said. ""It is essential that we have a drastic reduction of emissions in the next few years if you want to keep the 1.5 degrees Celsius limit alive,"" he added. As the world's biggest emitter, China's plans are key to keeping this goal in sight. Back in 2021, President Xi announced that China would aim to peak its emissions this decade and reach ""carbon neutrality"" by 2060 . Today's pledge marks the first time that China has set actual emissions reductions targets on that path. ""These targets represent China's best efforts based on the requirements of the Paris agreement,"" President Xi said. It also covers all greenhouse gases, not just carbon dioxide, and will be measured ""from peak levels"" of emissions - the timing of which President Xi did not specify. He added China would: expand wind and solar power capacity to more than six times 2020 levels increase forest stocks to more than 24bn cubic metres make ""new energy vehicles"" the mainstream in new vehicle sales Off track for 1.5C Such is the scale of China's emissions that any reduction would be significant in climate terms. China was responsible for more than a quarter of planet-warming emissions in 2023, at almost 14bn tonnes of carbon dioxide-equivalent. A 10% reduction in China's emissions would equate to 1.4bn tonnes a year, which is nearly four times the UK's total annual emissions. But China's new target does fall short of what would be needed to meet international climate goals. ""Anything less than 30% is definitely not aligned with 1.5 degrees,"" said Lauri Myllyvirta, lead analyst at the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air. Most scenarios to limit warming to 1.5C - or even well below 2C - would require China to make much greater cuts than that by 2035, he added. In many cases, that would mean more than a 50% reduction. It is further evidence of the gap between what needs to be done to meet climate targets and what countries are planning. Earlier this week, a report by the Stockholm Environment Institute warned that governments around the world are collectively planning to produce more than double the amount of fossil fuels in 2030 than would be in line with keeping to 1.5C. Ramp-up of renewables What gives some observers hope is that China has a track record of exceeding many of its international climate commitments. It had, for example, pledged to reach a capacity of 1,200 gigawatts for wind and solar power by 2030. It smashed through that goal in 2024 – six years early. ""The targets should be seen as a floor rather than a ceiling,"" said Li Shuo, director of China Climate Hub at the Asia Society Policy Institute. ""China's rapid clean tech growth […] could propel the country much further over the coming decade,"" he added. ""China's 2035 target simply isn't representative of the pace of the energy transition in the country,"" agreed Bernice Lee, distinguished fellow and senior adviser at Chatham House. ""There's a case to be made that Beijing missed a trick in landing a more ambitious goal as it would have won broad global praise - a stark contrast to the US,"" she added. While China ramps up its renewables, it continues to rely heavily on coal, the dirtiest fossil fuel. Last year saw China's electricity generation from coal hit a new record – although initial data suggests it has fallen in the first half of 2025 amid a surge in solar electricity. ""There is also mounting evidence that the country's emissions are plateauing, with this year's levels expected to be lower than in 2024,"" said Li Shuo. Today's new target signals ""the beginning of decarbonisation after decades of rapid emissions growth"", he added.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cj4y159190go,Science,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/73e0/live/86e8f090-97d0-11f0-9dd8-57dfaa725755.jpg,2025-09-24T18:57:20.911000+00:00,469f827716d4d3b66cf6cba4aab6e0b8b86523f8
f8c03333cacd,Musk's fellowship of Royal Society in doubt after rally address,,"Elon Musk's controversial comments at the Unite the Kingdom rally in London have raised doubts over his fellowship of the Royal Society - the world's most prestigious scientific institution. Addressing the rally organised by right-wing activist Tommy Robinson, Musk criticised ""uncontrolled migration"" and said: ""Whether you choose violence or not, violence is coming to you. You either fight back or you die."" In response, Sir Adrian Smith, president of the Society, wrote a letter to fellows in which he raised concerns about ""resorting to the language of violence"" and the threat it posed to the organisation's values. He said the matter would be discussed at the society's next council meeting. Elon Musk was first elected a fellow of the UK's national academy of sciences in 2018, for his work in the space and electric vehicle industries. But his continued participation in the Royal Society has grown increasingly controversial. Earlier this year, thousands of scientists signed a letter raising concerns about his involvement in funding cuts to US scientific research, as part of his previous role in Trump's Department of Government Efficiency. The Society debated his fellowship in March but it was decided he would remain. Some fellows said any attempts to remove him could be seen as a curtailment of freedom of expression. Without refencing Musk directly, Sir Adrian Smith wrote to fellows: ""I am sure that many of you will share my concern at the events of the last week and the growing tendency to resort to the language of violence in pursuit of political programmes - including, unfortunately, an address to the recent London rally from a Fellow of the Royal Society."" He went on to say that: ""Most of us have had the good fortune to have lived our lives in contexts where core values of tolerance, courtesy, respect for others, and freedom of speech have been widely acknowledged and respected and we have come to take them for granted."" ""It is no accident that human understanding and science have also flourished to an extraordinary extent in this period. Threats to these values are now real,"" he finished. Sir Adrian's letter was first reported by The New World. Addressing the crowds on Saturday via video link, Musk said: ""I think there's something beautiful about being British and what I see happening here is a destruction of Britain, initially a slow erosion but rapidly increasing erosion of Britain with massive uncontrolled migration. ""This is a message to the reasonable centre, the people who ordinarily wouldn't get involved in politics, who just want to live their lives. ""They don't want that, they're quiet, they just go about their business. ""My message is to them: if this continues, that violence is going to come to you, you will have no choice. You're in a fundamental situation here. ""Whether you choose violence or not, violence is coming to you. You either fight back or you die, that's the truth, I think."" Any decision to remove Mr Musk would be a significant moment in the organisation's history.

They say this is evidence humans may have got our taste for alcohol from common primate ancestors who relied on fermented fruit - a source of sugar and alcohol - for food. ""Human attraction to alcohol probably arose from this dietary heritage of our common ancestor with chimpanzees,"" said study researcher Aleksey Maro of the University of California, Berkeley. Chimps, like many other animals, have been spotted feeding on ripe fruit lying on the forest floor, but this is the first study to make clear how much alcohol they might be consuming. The research team measured the amount of ethanol, or pure alcohol, in fruits such as figs and plums eaten in large quantities by wild chimps in Côte d'Ivoire and Uganda. Based on the amount of fruit they normally eat, the chimps were ingesting around 14 grams of ethanol - equivalent to nearly two UK units, or roughly one 330ml bottle of lager. The fruits most commonly eaten were those highest in alcohol content. Aleksey Maro Figs are a significant part of the diet for many primates, including chimpanzees The research adds weight to the so-called ""drunken monkey"" hypothesis - the idea that the human appetite for alcohol was inherited from our primate ancestors. This was first proposed by Prof Robert Dudley of the University of California, Berkeley, who is a co-researcher on the study. Scientists were initially sceptical. But more observations of ""scrumping apes"" have emerged in recent years, said Prof Catherine Hobaiter, a primatologist at the University of St Andrews, who was not part of the research team. ""What we're realising from this work is that our relationship with alcohol goes deep back into evolutionary time, probably about 30 million years,"" she told BBC News. ""Maybe for chimpanzees, this is a great way to create social bonds, to hang out together on the forest floor, eating those fallen fruits."" Getty Images Wild chimpanzees in Uganda are under threat from deforestation and climate change Dr Kimberley Hockings, who studies primates at the University of Exeter and was not involved in the research, said it was important to note that the chimpanzees in this study were not consuming enough alcohol to become drunk. Had they done so,  ""this would clearly not improve their survival chances,"" she said. According to the International Union for the Conservation of Nature , chimpanzees are endangered and the biggest threats they face include losing their forest homes to farming, logging and building roads or towns.

9bff1ed42680,US energy chief tells BBC nuclear fusion will soon power the world,,"US energy chief tells BBC nuclear fusion will soon power the world Justin Rowlatt Climate Editor BBC/Pol Reygaerts US Energy Secretary Chris Wright spoke to BBC Climate Editor Justin Rowlatt during an interview in Brussels Don't worry too much about planet-warming emissions, the US Energy Secretary has told the BBC, because within five years AI will have enabled the harnessing of nuclear fusion – the energy that powers the sun and stars. Chris Wright told me in an interview that he expected the technology to deliver power to electricity grids around the world within eight to 15 years and that it would rapidly become a big driver of greenhouse gas reductions. His claims will likely surprise even enthusiasts for the technology. Harnessing the energy released when atoms fuse together could produce vast amounts of low carbon energy but most scientists believe commercial fusion power plants are still a long way off. ""With artificial intelligence and what's going on at the national labs and private companies in the United States, we will have that approach about how to harness fusion energy multiple ways within the next five years,"" said Mr Wright. ""The technology, it'll be on the electric grid, you know, in eight to 15 years."" Scientists believe nuclear fusion, which Mr Wright studied at university, could one day produce vast amounts of energy without heating up our atmosphere. But it's a very complex process. Replicating it on Earth involves heating atoms to temperatures many times hotter than the sun. President Donald Trump's controversial energy chief also urged the UK government to lift the de facto ban on fracking and issue new oil and gas licenses in the North Sea. The US Energy Secretary warned the Trump Administration had ""serious concerns"" about Europe's reliance on Chinese renewable technologies. ""It looks like the Chinese could control what's going on with your energy system,"" he said. He repeated the claims made by Donald Trump that the UK and Europe's effort to transition away from fossil fuels to low carbon energy is driving deindustrialisation and impoverishing their citizens. Mr Wright is in Brussels ahead of Donald Trump's second state visit to the UK next week. The US President will meet Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer and will attend a banquet hosted by King Charles at Windsor Castle. Getty Images China leads the world in solar technology and exports but the Trump administration has ""serious concerns"" about Europe's reliance on its renewable technologies During the BBC interview the US Energy Secretary said fracking – releasing oil and gas trapped rock formations underground - could have a ""tremendous"" impact on the UK economy. Mr Wright, who has founded and run fracking companies in the US, suggested the oil and gas the process would produce could ""bring back manufacturing and blue-collar jobs and drive down not just electricity prices, but home-heating prices and industrial energy prices"". Reform UK recently said it would encourage fracking in the UK if it were to win the next election, but the British Geological Survey has warned the potential for the technology to produce large amounts of oil and gas in the UK is likely to be limited. Mr Wright defended the billions of dollars of cuts the Trump Administration has made to renewable energy subsidies. He said wind power has been subsidised for 33 years and solar for 25 years. ""Isn't that enough?"" the Energy Secretary asked: ""You've got to be able to walk on your own after 25 to 30 years of subsidies."" Getty Images US Energy Secretary Chris Wright stands behind President Donald Trump as he holds an executive order The Energy Secretary also stood by the report issued by the Department of Energy in July which said the threat of climate change has been exaggerated. Among a series of controversial claims, the report said sea level rise is not accelerating, that computer models of the climate exaggerate future temperature rises and that climate scientists overlook beneficial aspects of climate change like the fact that high densities of carbon dioxide promote plant growth. Earlier this month more than 85 international scientists claimed it was riddled with errors and misrepresentations and that data had been ""cherry-picked"" - selectively chosen. The scientists also called into question the academic standards of the five authors of the paper. Mr Wright told the BBC he believes it is climate scientists who use data selectively.  ""Cherry-picking data in climate science, in the media, by activists and by politicians is the norm,"" he said. He acknowledged that climate change is a ""very real, physical phenomenon"" and said that he believes the world will decarbonise: ""It's just generations from now, not two or three decades from now."" He said he was delighted his report had prompted such vigorous debate: ""We've got a dialogue back and forth about climate change in a public forum.  I've wanted that for 20 years."" He denied that the cuts the Trump Administration is making to climate science, including a proposal to slash the funding for the US's National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), would damage US research into weather and climate. There has been speculation that the cuts could block the development of the next generation of weather satellites and could even lead to the closure of the Mauna Loa Observatory in Hawaii, which is responsible for the longest record of direct measurements of CO2 concentrations in the atmosphere. ""There are a lot of rumours about all sorts of terrible things happening,"" said Mr Wright, who claimed the US government is trying to restore ""real science"". He claimed: ""One of the problems of science is it's become so politicised in the climate world, if you deviate from the church, your funding gets cut off.""",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cqlz5p314z0o,Science,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/b857/live/0643dc50-8f58-11f0-84c8-99de564f0440.jpg,2025-09-11T23:02:49.282000+00:00,f67b79e48ae2d7176f4abaa40519b58eac92d5cf
acc8f47ed926,Tories pledge to get all oil and gas out of North Sea,,"Kemi Badenoch has said her party will remove all net zero requirements on oil and gas companies drilling in the North Sea if elected. The Conservative leader is to formally announce the plan to focus solely on ""maximising extraction"" to get ""all our oil and gas out of the North Sea"" in a speech in Aberdeen on Tuesday, She will claim that net zero measures mean households end up ""paying the price through higher energy bills"". The Labour government has committed to banning new exploration licences. A spokesperson said: ""We'll take no lectures from Kemi Badenoch. Every family and business paid the price of the Conservatives' failure to secure the UK's energy."" Exploring new fields would ""not take a penny off bills"" or improve energy security and would ""only accelerate the worsening climate crisis"", a government spokesperson warned. Badenoch signalled a significant change in Conservative climate policy when she announced earlier this year that reaching net zero would be ""impossible"" by 2050 . Successive UK governments have pledged to reach the target by 2050 and it was written into law by Theresa May in 2019. It means the UK must cut carbon emissions until it removes as much as it produces, in line with the 2015 Paris Climate Agreement. Now Badenoch has said that requirements to work towards net zero are a burden on oil and gas producers in the North Sea which are damaging the economy and which she would remove. The Tory leader said a Conservative government would scrap the need to reduce emissions or to work on technologies such as carbon storage. Badenoch said it was ""absurd"" the UK was leaving ""vital resources untapped"" while ""neighbours like Norway extracted them from the same sea bed"". Her plan echoes US President Donald Trump's pledge to ""drill, baby, drill"" and embark on new oil and gas exploration. It is a reversal of former President Joe Biden's Inflation Reduction Act, which channelled billions of dollars into clean energy. In 2023, then Prime Minister Rishi Sunak granted 100 new licences to drill in the North Sea which he said at the time was ""entirely consistent"" with net zero commitments. Since then, major energy companies such as BP have U-turned on the level of investment in renewables to focus on increasing oil and gas production in order to boost profitability. Tessa Khan, executive director of Uplift, a research and campaign group, said Badenoch's plan was ""reckless"" and would not ""bring down energy bills"". ""These rules are the bare minimum to needed hold the industry to account, and removing them will simply mean more emissions, more environmental harm and more handouts to oil and gas giants at the nation's expense,"" she said. Reform UK has said it will abolish the push for net zero if elected. But Liberal Democrat environment spokesperson Tim Farron said scrapping requirements to reduce emissions ""is nothing short of irresponsible environmental vandalism"". He said the UK ""should be setting our sights on leading the world in clean energy, in off shore wind, instead of falling back to a dependency on fossil fuels"". Research shows that 2024 was the first calendar year where global average temperatures were more than 1.5C above pre-industrial levels. This made it the hottest year since records began in 1850, according to the Copernicus Climate Change Service, which is managed by the European Commission and uses data from the European Union's space programme. The UK was one of 200 countries to sign the Paris Agreement who agreed to ""pursue efforts"" to limit global temperature rises to 1.5C and keep them ""well below"" 2.0C above those recorded in pre-industrial times. Gillian Martin, the Scottish government's energy secretary, said: ""Too many are offering easy answers when what we need are the right answers."" She said that because the North Sea basin is ""maturing"", the ""responsible approach is to plan now for this eventuality, transitioning to new fuels and sustainable energy in a way that protects our energy security and Scotland's highly skilled workforce in the North East"". But David Whitehouse, chief executive of Offshore Energies UK, a trade organisation representing the industry, said: ""The choice is clear - do we prioritise our homegrown energy or choose to sacrifice our jobs to rely on imports? ""While we use oil and gas, let us produce it here in the UK responsibly, alongside an accelerated rollout of renewables. In a country importing 40% of its energy needs, we need both."" The current government said it had made the ""biggest ever investment in offshore wind and three first of a kind carbon capture and storage clusters"". Carbon capture and storage facilities aim to prevent carbon dioxide (CO2) produced from industrial processes and power stations from being released into the atmosphere. Most of the CO2 produced is captured, transported and then stored deep underground. It is seen by the likes of the International Energy Agency and the Climate Change Committee as a key element in meeting targets to cut the greenhouse gases driving dangerous climate change. Green Party MP Ellie Chowns, said: ""By far the best option for British growth, British jobs is investment in that green industrial transformation. Not the technology of the old century the 20th century, we need to invest in the technology of the 21st century.""

dbde8c486b16,Military drills spark hundreds of wildfires in UK,,"Military drills spark hundreds of wildfires in UK Malcolm Prior Rural affairs producer BBC Live army manoeuvres have caused 385 wildfires on MoD training sites across the UK countryside since 2023 Live-fire military training has sparked hundreds of wildfires across the UK countryside since 2023, with unexploded shells often making it too dangerous to tackle them. Fire crews battling a vast moorland blaze in North Yorkshire this month have been hampered by exploding bombs and tank shells dating back to training on the moors during the Second World War. Figures obtained by the BBC show that of the 439 wildfires on Ministry of Defence (MoD) land between January 2023 and last month, 385 were caused by present-day army manoeuvres themselves. The MoD said it has a robust wildfire policy which monitors risk levels and limits live ammunition use when necessary. HIWFRS Wildfires left to burn can cause large amounts of smoke pollution and have a significant environmental impact But locals near the sites of recent fires told the BBC they felt the MoD needed to do more to prevent them, including completely banning live fire training in the driest months. Wildfires in the countryside can start for many reasons, including discarded cigarettes, unattended campfires and BBQs and deliberate arson, and the scale of them can be made worse by dry, hot conditions and the amount of vegetation on the land. But according to data obtained by the BBC under the Freedom of Information Act, there have been 1,178 wildfires in total linked to present-day MoD training sites since 2020 – with 101 out of 134 wildfires in the first six months of this year caused by military manoeuvres or training. More than 80 of the fires caused by training itself so far this year have been in so-called ""Range Danger Areas"" - also known as ""impact zones"". These are areas where the level of danger means the local fire service is usually not allowed access and the fire is left to burn out on its own, albeit contained by firebreaks. The large amounts of smoke produced can lead to road closures, disruption and health risks to local residents, who are directed to keep their windows shut despite it often being the hottest time of the year. One villager who lives near the MoD's training site on Salisbury Plain said wildfires there, like the recent one in May , were ""a perennial problem"" and the MoD had to do more to control them and restrict the use of live ordnance to outside of the hottest months. Neil Lockhart, from Great Cheverell, near Devizes in Wiltshire, said the smoke from fires left to burn was a major environmental issue and posed a risk to the health and safety of locals. Villager Neil Lockhart has asthma and says the smoke produced by the wildfires causes him particular challenges ""It's the pollution. If you suffer like I do with asthma, and it's the height of the summer and you've got to keep all your windows closed, then it's an issue,"" explained Mr Lockhart. Arable farmer Tim Daw, whose land at All Cannings overlooks the MoD training site on Salisbury Plain, said he ""must have seen three or four big fires this year"" but found the smoke only a ""mild annoyance"". He said many locals were worried about the impact of the wildfires on wildlife and the landscape, saying the extent of the area affected by the blazes often looked ""fairly horrendous"", and likened it to a ""burnt savannah"". But he said the MoD was ""very proactive"" in keeping locals informed about the risks of wildfires and any ongoing problems on their land. Wartime ""legacy"" Aside from the problem of live military training sparking fires, old unexploded ordnance left behind from previous manoeuvres make wildfires harder to fight, This month has seen a major fire burning on Langdale Moor, in the North York Moors National Park, since Monday, 11 August. It has seen a number of bombs explode in areas that were once used for military training dating back to the Second World War. One local landowner, George Winn-Darley, said the peat fire had produced ""an enormous cloud of pollution"" that could have been prevented if there had not been live ordnance on site. ""If that unexploded ordnance had been cleared up and wasn't there then this wildfire would have been able to be dealt with, probably completely, nearly two weeks ago,"" he told the BBC. Mr Winn-Darley called for the MoD to clear up any major munitions left on the moors. ""That would seem to be the absolute minimum that they should be doing,"" he said. ""It seems ridiculous that here we are, 80 years after the end of the Second World War, and we're still dealing with this legacy."" A MoD spokesperson said the fire at Langdale had not started on land currently owned by the MoD but that an Army Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) team had responded on four occasions to requests for assistance from North Yorkshire Police. ""Various Second World War-era unexploded ordnance items were discovered as a result of the wildfires, which the EOD operator declared to be inert practice projectiles. They were retrieved for subsequent disposal,"" he explained. He added that the MoD monitors the risk of fires across its training estate throughout the year and restricts the use of ordnance, munitions and explosives when training is taking place during periods of elevated wildfire risk. ""Impact areas"" are constructed with fire breaks, such as stone tracks, around them to prevent the wider spread of fire and grazing is used to keep the amount of combustible vegetation down. Earlier this month, the MoD launched its ""Respect the Range"" campaign , designed to raise the public's awareness of the dangers of accessing military land, such as live firing, unexploded ordnance and wildfires. A spokeswoman for the National Fire Chiefs Council (NFCC) said it worked closely with the MoD to ""understand the risk and locations of munitions and to create plans to effectively extinguish fires"". ""We always encourage military colleagues to account for the conditions and the potential for wildfire when considering when to carry out their training,"" she added.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy08j04je2jo,Science,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/4a40/live/aee52200-835b-11f0-b3de-c13d348c14aa.jpg,2025-08-30T00:55:53.136000+00:00,cdedbf97f940c747cf06f0bab09673c0559c7a44

Helen Briggs BBC environment correspondent and Gwyndaf Hughes Science videographer BBC The Druids Oak is the oldest living tree in this woodland in Buckinghamshire Dr Ed Pyne snips a leaf from the Druids Oak, an 800-year-old tree that has watched over this woodland in Buckinghamshire for centuries, enduring droughts, storms, heatwaves and more. ""We know that this tree is a survivor,"" he says, taking a leaf sample for DNA testing. ""Is it just that it's got lucky? Has it led a stress-free life? Or is there something special about the genes of this tree?"" The conservation scientist from the charity, The Woodland Trust, thinks the secrets of such remarkable resilience lie in its DNA. The experts want to understand how oaks can live for 1,000 years or more, resisting threats such as climate change and bouncing back from disease - knowledge that could be vital in restoring Britain's depleted woodlands. ""By exploring the genome of ancient trees, we can understand how to manage them better so that we can secure their future for generations to come,"" says Dr Emma Gilmartin of the tree charity, the Arboricultural Association, which is involved in the project. Dr Emma Gilmartin says ancient trees like the Druids Oak are monuments of nature English oaks are one of the UK's best-loved trees, growing widely in parks, gardens and the countryside. They are classed as ancient when they reach around 400 years of age. By studying the DNA of ancient oaks, the scientists hope to unravel the genes behind the trees' long life and their ability to survive climatic extremes. This information would be used to select the best oak trees to plant in the future, to restore woodlands and bring back wildlife. About 50 of the UK's most well-known ancient oaks will be studied, including: The Druids Oak Dr Ed Pyne and Dr Emma Gilmartin measure the girth of the tree, which comes in at   9m Located within a nature reserve in Buckinghamshire managed by the City of London Corporation The tree likely dates to the 13th Century, making it older than many historical buildings The tree has a girth and height of about 9m It has been pollarded, meaning its upper branches were historically cut back to encourage regrowth above the reach of grazing animals, giving it a distinctive squat shape Oaks were revered by ancient druids, which may have inspired the tree's name. The Crouch Oak The tree is now hollow due to age and decay, but it remains a cherished local landmark Found off a busy high street in Addlestone, Surrey One of the oldest in the borough, it is believed to be at least 800 years old The name ""Crouch Oak"" may come from the Middle English word crouche, meaning cross, possibly indicating its use as a boundary marker It is also referred to as Queen Elizabeth's Picnic Tree, after Elizabeth I is said to have dined beneath it. As well as their cultural and historical value, oaks are a haven for wildlife. They support more life than any other native tree species in the UK, hosting more than 2,300 species, including birds, mammals, insects, fungi, and lichens. Their leaves feed caterpillars, their bark shelters bats and beetles, and their acorns sustain mammals and birds through the winter. Some of these species are very rare, such as the Moccas Beetle, which lives on just 14 old oak trees in Moccas Park, Herefordshire. Britain is a stronghold for ancient oaks, holding more than the rest of Europe combined At the National Nature Reserve adjoining Moccas Park, conservationists are putting oaks at the heart of an effort to restore the landscape. They are restoring a natural wildlife-rich habitat made up of open grasslands populated with ancient trees, known as wood pasture. Acorns of ancient oaks that have stood for centuries in the area are being collected and grown into young oak trees, then put back where they once stood. Conifers that weren't part of the natural habitat were once planted here, but these are being removed and woodlands restored. This has led to a resurgence of rare species, including hundreds of different flies and beetles, rare bats and woodland birds. ""We're really seeing a sort of boom in the bird population here,"" says Tom Simpson of Natural England, the UK government agency responsible for protecting and improving England's natural environment. ""In a short period of time – that's 16 years of restoration - we are really seeing nature recovery on this site. "" The National Nature Reserve near Moccas in Herefordshire is a haven for rare birds and insects Young oak trees grown from ancient oaks show the way to restore woodlands As climate change and habitat loss become bigger problems, conservationists want better protection and care for ancient trees. Old trees can't be replaced - they take decades or even centuries to grow and support many other living things. Saul Herbert of The Woodland Trust says more needs to be done to protect these  ""living legends"". ""We need to find out where they are and we need to engage with people and communities to ensure that these trees are valued and looked after for the ecological, cultural and the historic value that they bring to our landscapes,"" he says.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx2xz8r7egpo,Science,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/6ead/live/6e288800-849c-11f0-b391-6936825093bd.jpg,2025-08-29T00:10:56.472000+00:00,0589bfb66b1d24ff7ebd8422582531476f63c9de

The record-breaking round-the-world yachtswoman said it was a ""huge honour"", adding: ""The fact that the Istiorachis 'sail' could be likened to the sails I have spent so much of my life below was very touching."" After being analysed it has now been officially named and described by island-based scientist Jeremy Lockwood, and is now on display at Dinosaur Isle Museum in Sandown. PA/James Brown Jeremy Lockwood with the spinal column of an Istiorachis macaruthurae The medium-sized herbivore once roamed the floodplains of what is now the island's south-west coast. Its remains, which date back 125 million years, were originally discovered by fossil hunter Nick Chase , who died of cancer in 2019. Before Dr Lockwood's analysis the fossils were assumed to have belonged to one of the two known iguanodontian dinosaur species from the Isle of Wight. He said: ""While the skeleton wasn't as complete as some of the others that have been found, no-one had really taken a close look at these bones before. ""It was thought to be just another specimen of one of the existing species, but this one had particularly long neural spines, which was very unusual. ""It may have been used for display, much like a peacock's feathers, possibly to attract mates or intimidate rivals."" For the study, researchers compared the fossilised bones with a database of similar dinosaur back bones which allowed them to see how these sail-like formations had evolved. EMCTrust Dame Ellen MacArthur, who is from Derbyshire, said it was ""both extraordinary and a huge honour"" to have the dinosaur named after her Dame Ellen, founder and patron of the East Cowes based charity the Ellen MacArthur Cancer Trust, said: ""It is certainly not an everyday occurrence to be asked if a newly discovered dinosaur could reference your name in its title.

083930a8829e,Scientists make 'superfood' that could save honeybees,,"Scientists make 'superfood' that could save honeybees Georgina Rannard Climate and science correspondent Gwyndaf Hughes/BBC Scientists have developed a honeybee ""superfood"" that could protect the animals against the threats of climate change and habitat loss. Bee colonies that ate the supplement during trials had up to 15 times more baby bees that grew to adulthood. Honeybees are a vital part of food production and contribute to the pollination by animals of 70% of leading global crops. ""This technological breakthrough provides all the nutrients bees need to survive, meaning we can continue to feed them even when there's not enough pollen,"" senior author Professor Geraldine Wright at the University of Oxford told BBC News. ""It really is a huge accomplishment,"" she says. Gywndaf Hughes/BBC Honeybees globally are facing severe declines, due to nutrient deficiencies, viral diseases, climate change and other factors. In the US, annual colony losses have ranged between 40-50% in the last decade and are expected to increase. Beekeepers in the UK have faced serious challenges too. Nick Mensikov, chair of the Cardiff, Vale and Valleys Beekeepers Association, told BBC News that he lost 75% of his colonies last winter and that this has been seen across South Wales. ""Although the hives have all been full of food, the bees have just dwindled. Most of the bees survived through January, February, and then they just vanished,"" he says. Gwyndaf Hughes/BBC Nick Mensikov has kept hives for 15 years and sells honey in South Wales Honeybees feed on pollen and nectar from flowers that contain the nutrients, including lipids called sterols that are necessary for their development. They make honey in hives, which becomes their food source over winter when flowers have stopped producing pollen. When beekeepers take out honey to sell, or, increasingly, when there isn't enough pollen available, they give the insects supplementary food. But that food is made up of protein flour, sugar and water, and has always lacked the nutrients bees require. It is like humans eating a diet without carbohydrates, amino acids, or other vital nutrients. Sterol has always proved very difficult to manufacture, but Prof Wright has led a group of scientists for 15 years to identify which exact sterols bees need and how to engineer them. Gwyndaf Hughes/BBC Professor Geraldine Wright was inspired to work on bee nutrition after beekeepers told her about how many of their bees were dying In the lab at Oxford, PhD student Jennifer Chennells showed us small clear boxes of honeybees in an incubator that she feeds with different foods she has made. She uses kitchen equipment you could find at home to make the ingredients, and rolls out glossy, white tubes of food. ""We put ingredients into what's like a cookie dough, with different proteins, fats, different amounts of carbohydrate, and the micronutrients that bees need. It's to try to work out what they like best and what's best for them,"" she says. She pushes the tubes inside the boxes and bees nibble at the mixture. It's in this lab that, using gene editing, Prof Wright's team successfully made a yeast that can produce the six sterols that bees need. ""It's a huge breakthrough. When my student was able to engineer the yeast to create the sterols, she sent me a picture of the chromatogram that was a result of the work,"" she says, referring to a chart of the substance structure. ""I still have it on the wall of my office,"" she explains. See inside the hive that tested honeybee 'superfood' The ""superfood"" was fed to bees in the lab's hives for three months. The results showed that colonies fed the food had up to 15 times more baby bees that made it to adulthood. ""When the bees have a complete nutrition they should be healthier and less susceptible to disease,"" Prof Wright says. Prof Wright says the food would be particularly useful during summers like this one when flowering plants appear to have stopped producing early. Gwyndaf Hughes/BBC Beekeepers often feed supplementary food to bees to sustain them ""It's really important in years when the summer came early and bees will not have sufficient pollen and nectar to make it through the winter,"" she says. ""The more months that they go without pollen, the more nutritional stress that they will face, which means that the beekeepers will have greater losses of those bees over winter,"" she explains. Larger-scale trials are now needed to assess the long-term impacts of the food on honeybee health, but the supplement could be available to beekeepers and farmers within two years. The study was led by University of Oxford, working with Royal Botanic Gardens Kew, University of Greenwich, and the Technical University of Denmark.

fdc767bcf2f3,Why scientists hope seabed mud could reveal Antarctic Ocean secrets,,"Why scientists hope seabed mud could reveal Antarctic Ocean secrets Victoria Gill Science correspondent, BBC News Elisenda Balleste The researchers worked from a vessel at a number of locations around the Antarctic Peninsula Kate Stephens and Gwyndaf Hughes BBC News science team Why would anyone brave hand-numbing cold, icy winds and rough seas - sometimes working through the night - to dig up mud from the Antarctic seabed? That is what an international team of particularly adventurous researchers did earlier this year in the remote Antarctic Peninsula, on a mission aiming to reveal centuries of scientific secrets about the Southern Ocean. Scientists around the world will now share and analyse these precious mud samples to work out how human activity - including a century of industrial whaling -  affected Antarctica and the rest of our planet. The research is part of a global effort to understand the relationship between the ocean and the climate. Elisenda Balleste The core of mud is carefully removed from the drill and kept intact for analysis A history of ocean life Researchers used a special coring drill - a bit like a huge apple-corer - tethered to a research ship, to drill at depths of up to 500m. They collected more than 40 long cores, or tubes, of seafloor sediment from locations around the peninsula. This is one of the richest habitats for marine life in Antarctica, and a focal point for fishing, tourism and - before it was banned in the 1980s - industrial whale hunting. Collecting the sediment gives insight and clues to the past, ""like a book of history"", explained lead researcher Dr Elisenda Balleste from the University of Barcelona. ""What is living in the seas now, what was living in the seas in the past and evidence of our human impact"" is recorded in layer upon layer of sediment over centuries, she said. By preserving and dating those layers, and analysing what they contain, researchers can build a picture of the history of Antarctic marine life. Victoria Gill/BBC The Antarctic is a feeding ground for whales and other marine life Once on board the ship, the cores were frozen and transported to Barcelona and Dr Balleste's laboratory. From there, carefully extracted pieces of this Antarctic mud will be sent out to several academic institutions around the world. Scientists will scan and date the sediment layers, work out what microbial life they contain, measure levels of pollution and calculate how much carbon is buried in the mud. It is part of a mission - the Convex Seascape Survey - which involves universities and research institutions around the globe working together to better understand how our ocean and climate are connected. Claire Allen, an oceanographer from the British Antarctic Survey who has studied Antarctica's past for more than 20 years, said that cores like these were particularly valuable. ""Before 1950 - before there was any kind of monitoring capacity in Antarctica - sediment cores and ice cores are the only way that we can get an insight into any of the climatic or physical properties that have changed over time,"" she said. Elisenda Balleste Scientists carefully slice the sediment cores in a lab on board the ship The DNA fingerprint from whale hunting The newly collected samples being stored for DNA analysis have to be kept at temperatures low enough to stop all biological processes. Dr Balleste took them out of the industrial-sized freezer where they are being stored to show them to us, very briefly. ""They're kept at minus 80 degrees to stop them degrading,"" she explained. These small pieces of the seabed - frozen in time at temperatures that preserve genetic material - will be used for what is known as environmental DNA analysis. It is an area of science which has developed rapidly in recent years. It gives researchers the ability to extract genetic information from water, soil and even air, like a fingerprint of life left behind in the environment. Getty Images Industrial whaling in Antarctica drove many species to the brink of extinction Dr Carlos Preckler, from King Abdullah University in Saudi Arabia, is leading this part of the research and will be trying to measure how almost a century of industrial whaling in Antarctica affected the ocean and our atmosphere. Carbon - when it is released into the atmosphere as carbon dioxide - warms up our planet like a blanket. So, as the world struggles to reduce those emissions, any processes that absorb and lock significant amounts of carbon might help to rein in global warming. ""We know whales have a lot of carbon in their bodies, because they are huge animals,"" said Dr Preckler. What he and his colleagues want to know is how much of that carbon gets buried in the seafloor - and locked away from the atmosphere - when the animals die. ""We can measure whale DNA and the carbon in the sediment,"" explained Dr Preckler. ""So we can measure what happened before industrial whaling removed most of the whales in the [Southern] ocean,"" he added. That, the researchers say, will provide a measure of how much whales - simply by existing, being huge and living out their natural lives - remove carbon from our atmosphere and help in the fight against climate change.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cm2vz9jg8jzo,Science,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/4be9/live/74786430-7788-11f0-907d-6ff0082c2def.jpg,2025-08-18T23:21:37.548000+00:00,c086f572bee7c3806a192937427f7e57e1061f12

The offences, which occurred between 2022 and 2024 at the energy-from-waste plant, were revealed last week after the operator Viridor admitted it had been collecting pollution data incorrectly. Sutton Council, who sends waste to the site, has written to the Environment Secretary Steve Reed urging him to take enforcement action and say it was only told about the breaches 16 months after they were discovered. A Viridor spokesperson said it takes environmental responsibility seriously and the under-reporting was ""human error"". The plant provides waste disposal services for 400,000 households across four councils - Croydon, Sutton, Merton and Kingston. In order to operate, it has to record daily air pollution from burning the waste for key pollutants and ensure these remain below certain levels. In March, Viridor realised that its monitoring software was incorrectly calibrated and that a reassessment revealed it had been breached daily pollution limits for nitrogen oxides regularly between August 2022 and March 2024. The Environment Agency (EA) was notified and a subsequent investigation confirmed 16 breaches of its licence - one for each quarter across its two incinerators. The regulator told the BBC it was considering further enforcement action. This could include a fine and, as a last resort, criminal proceedings - although such action is rarely taken. A Viridor spokesperson said: ""The Environment Agency has acknowledged the breaches at Beddington resulted from human error on the part of the third-party contractor, corroborating the independent environmental consultant's investigation."" It went on to say it takes environmental responsibility seriously. 'Potential harm' Sutton Council told the BBC it was only notified of the breaches this month - some 16 months after Viridor first found the issue. On Friday, council leader Barry Lewis wrote to the company and the Environment Secretary who represents neighbouring Streatham and Croydon North, raising concerns about the health impacts and reiterating its opposition to the proposed expansion of the site. In his letter to Mr Reed, Mr Lewis said the news is ""still deeply troubling"" for residents. ""What is also concerning is the lack of proper monitoring and scrutiny by the EA. it is important that our residents have confidence in the ability of government regulators. This report only contributes to the erosion of that trust,"" he wrote. The government has yet to respond. Nitrogen dioxide has been associated with adverse health effects including increased respiratory symptoms. The UK Health Security Agency assessed local monitors following the revelation, and confirmed that daily air quality limits were not breached and ""the emissions are unlikely to have caused harm to human health or the environment."" But it also said ""an exposed population is likely to be subject to potential harm at any level.""",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c627evk7yrzo,Science,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/e0e1/live/0b410df0-83fe-11f0-a3f8-9b56bf5c3841.jpg,2025-08-28T12:48:19.198000+00:00,146251721ae7a5987049ebb772028c9d1c3bc7f6
f6574b68e9b3,SpaceX pulls off Starship rocket launch in much-needed comeback,,"SpaceX pulls off Starship rocket launch in much-needed comeback Georgina Rannard Science correspondent Watch: SpaceX Starship completes successful test flight SpaceX has pulled off a successful test flight of its newest generation rocket Starship, reversing a trend of disappointing failures. The world's largest and most powerful rocket blasted off from Texas just after 18:30 local time (00:30 BST) for a nail-biting 60-minute flight. Parts of the engine appeared to explode at one stage, and flaps on the side of the rocket caught fire and swung from side-to-side. US space agency Nasa plans to use Starship to send humans to the Moon for its Artemis programme in 2027. ""Great work by the SpaceX team!!"", posted SpaceX CEO Elon Musk on X, who is spending billions on developing Starship, which each launch costing an estimated $100m. He will be welcoming the success after three Starship launches ended in spectacular failure this year, and one rocket exploded on its test stand in June. Starship is the largest and most powerful rocket built to date. It is made up of a  booster called Super Heavy and the spacecraft Starship. The signs were positive from the start of Tuesday's test flight. All of the booster's 33 engines fired up, and after about seven minutes, the booster separated from the spacecraft and fell into the Gulf of Mexico. Starship continued to ascend, reaching a maximum height of almost 200km above Earth, before coasting around the planet. SpaceX said it intended to put the rocket under stress to test its limits, and parts of the rocket's flaps appeared to burn and swing wildly during the descent. The company has designed Starship to one day be a fully reusable transport system capable of carrying people to the Moon and Mars. ""This was a great day for SpaceX, executing its full mission for the first time and deploying some test dummy satellites along the route,"" says Dr Simeon Barber, a planetary scientist at the Open University. He adds that SpaceX will have gathered a full set of data from take-off, cruising and landing, which is a big step forward for the company. The first version of the rocket had five successful launches, but all attempts to launch the newest version had ended in spectacular explosions. In March, one explosion grounded flights and caused debris to rain down over the Bahamas with pieces landing in the Turks and Caicos Islands in the Caribbean. But SpaceX did successfully execute the ""chopstick"" manoeuvre that caught the rocket booster in mechanical arms when it returned to Earth. Starship is the largest and most powerful rocket system which has ever flown It is high stakes for US space agency Nasa, too. It has contracted SpaceX to use a modified version of Starship to take humans to the Moon as part its Artemis programme in 2027, although most observers say that date is almost certain to slip. ""This is also a big step forward for Nasa's Artemis program, but there's still a lot of development work to happen to get this spacecraft ready and to be rated to carry humans safely to the Moon,"" Dr Barber says. Mr Musk wants Starship to be certified for human travel as early as next year, and has also suggested it will start un-crewed flights to Mars in the next 12 months. SpaceX's mantra has been to fail fast, learn fast. Rather than taking a cautious approach, it has always aimed to move quickly and when rockets have exploded, the company says it is simply a chance to collect performance data. But after three failures in a row this year, questions were being asked about the future of SpaceX and about whether Mr Musk had been spending too much time on US politics. The world's richest man was a key supporter of US President Donald Trump in the 2024 election campaign, and until a falling out in June, the two men were close allies. Starship returned to Earth battered and bruised on Tuesday but it was a big step forward for the company that needs to prove it can safely and reliably take humans to the Moon. Tuesday's success ""gets the programme back on track - getting to the Moon is another question,"" suggests Dr Ken Kremer, research scientist and founder of website Space UpClose. He says the US reaching the moon in 2027 is ""extremely unlikely. I don't want to say it's impossible but it's extremely unlikely"". The US is racing against China to be the first to return humans to the Moon, and some scientists say that even with Starship's progress, it is likely that China will win.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cly69z9lwnno,Science,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/65a1/live/b78d26f0-82e8-11f0-ab3e-bd52082cd0ae.jpg,2025-08-27T13:00:47.828000+00:00,4527dbca0e647bc064280331f8527aed707464fb
9b89234f54ef,"Jim Lovell, Apollo 13 astronaut, dies aged 97",,"Jim Lovell, Apollo 13 astronaut, dies aged 97 Watch: Moment Jim Lovell told earth ""Houston, we've had a problem"" as Apollo 13 suffered a fault Astronaut Jim Lovell, who guided the Apollo 13 mission safely back to Earth in 1970, has died aged 97. Nasa said he had ""turned a potential tragedy into a success"" after an attempt to land on the Moon was aborted because of an explosion onboard the spacecraft while it was hundreds of thousands of miles from Earth. Tens of millions watched on television as Lovell and two other astronauts splashed back down into the Pacific Ocean, a moment which has become one of the most iconic in the history of space travel. Lovell, who was also part of the Apollo 8 mission, was the first man to go to the Moon twice - but never actually landed. Acting Nasa head Sean Duffy said Lovell had helped the US space programme to ""forge a historic path"". In a statement, Lovell's family said: ""We will miss his unshakeable optimism, his sense of humor, and the way he made each of us feel we could do the impossible. He was truly one of a kind."" Tom Hanks, who played Lovell in the 1995 movie Apollo 13 , called the astronaut one of those people ""who dare, who dream, and who lead others to the places we would not go on our own"". Hanks said in a statement on Instagram that Lovell's many voyages ""were not made for riches or celebrity, but because such challenges as those are what fuels the course of being alive"". NASA Teenage rocket maker One Saturday, a 16-year-old hauled a heavy, three-foot tube into the middle of a large field in Wisconsin. He had persuaded his science teacher to help him make a makeshift rocket. Somehow, he had managed to get his hands on the ingredients for gunpowder - potassium nitrate, sulphur and charcoal. He pulled on a welder's helmet for protection. He packed it with powder, struck a match and ran like hell. The rocket rose 80 feet into the air and exploded. Had the chemicals been packed slightly differently, he would have been blown to pieces. For Jim Lovell, this was more than a childish lark. In achieving his dream to be a rocket scientist, he would become an American hero. But it was not going to be easy. Getty Images The crew of the ill-fated Apollo 13: Jack Swigert, Jim Lovell and Fred Haise James Arthur Lovell Jr was born on 25 March 1928 - just a year after Charles Lindbergh made his historic trip across the Atlantic. ""Boys like either dinosaurs or airplanes,"" he said. ""I was very much an airplane boy."" When he was five years old, his father died in a car accident. His mother, Blanche, worked all hours, struggling to keep food on the table. University was well beyond their financial reach. The answer was the US Navy, which was hungry for new pilots after World War Two. It was not building rockets but at least it involved flying. Lovell signed up to a programme that sent him to college at the military's expense while training as a fighter pilot. Two years in, he gambled and switched to the Navy Academy at Annapolis, on Chesapeake Bay, in the hope of working with his beloved rockets. It was a lucky decision. A few months later, the Korean War broke out and his former fellow apprentice pilots were sent to South East Asia. Many never got to finish their education. Marriage was banned at Annapolis and girlfriends discouraged. The navy did not want its midshipmen wasting their time on such frivolities. But Lovell had a sweetheart. Marilyn Gerlach was the high school girl he had shyly asked to the prom. Women were not allowed on campus and trips outside were limited to 45 minutes. Somehow the relationship survived. Just hours after his graduation in 1952, the newly commissioned Ensign Lovell married her. They would be together for more than 70 years, until Marilyn's death in 2023. Getty Images Jim and Marilyn Lovell were high school sweethearts He did everything he could to advertise his love of rocketry. His thesis at the Navy Academy was in the unheard-of topic of liquid-fuel engines. After graduation, he hoped to specialise in this pioneering new technology. But the navy had other ideas. Lovell was assigned to an aircraft carrier group flying Banshee jets off ships at night. It was a white-knuckle, high-wire business fit only for daredevils. But for Lovell, it was not enough. Kennedy's men In 1958, he applied to Nasa. Project Mercury was America's attempt to place a man in orbit around the Earth. Jim Lovell was one of the 110 test pilots considered for selection but a temporary liver condition put paid to his chances. Four years later, he tried again. In June 1962, after gruelling medical tests, Nasa announced its ""New Nine"". These would be the men to deliver on President Kennedy's pledge to put American boots on the Moon. It was the most elite group of flying men ever assembled. They included Neil Armstrong, John Young and, fulfilling his childhood dream, Jim Lovell. Getty Images Apollo 8 was Nasa's most dangerous mission yet Three years later he was ready. His first trip into space was aboard the two-man Gemini 7. Lovell and fellow astronaut Frank Borman ate a steak-and-eggs breakfast and blasted off. Their mission: to find out if men could survive two weeks in space. If not, the Moon was out of reach. With the endurance record complete, Lovell's next flight was in command of Gemini 12 alongside space rookie Buzz Aldrin. This time they proved that man could work outside a spacecraft. Aldrin clambered awkwardly into the void, spending five hours photographing star fields. Now for the Moon itself. The crew of Apollo 8 would be the first to travel beyond low Earth orbit and enter the gravitational pull of another celestial body. It was Nasa's most dangerous mission yet. 'Get the camera' The Saturn V rocket that shot Lovell, Borman and William Anders out of our atmosphere at 25,000mph (40,233km/h) was huge - three times larger than anything seen on the Gemini programme. As navigator, Lovell took with him a sextant to take star readings - in case the computers failed and they had to find their own way home. Sixty-eight hours after take-off, they made it. The engines fired and Apollo 8 slid silently behind the Moon. The men heard a crackle in their headsets as the radio signal to Mission Control faltered and then failed. The spellbound astronauts pinned themselves to the windows, the first humans to see the far side of our nearest celestial neighbour. And then, from over the advancing horizon, an incredible sight. ""Earthrise,"" gasped Borman. ""Get the camera, quick,"" said Lovell. Getty Images The image of Earth from Space captivated the World It was Christmas Eve 1968. America was mired in Vietnam abroad and civil unrest at home. But at that moment, it seemed that humanity was united. The people of the world saw their planet as the astronauts saw it - fragile and beautiful, shining in the desolation of space. Lovell read from the Book of Genesis, the basis of many of the world's great religions, to the people of the Earth. ""And God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night. And the evening and the morning were the first day."" For him, it was an image that changed our world forever. He put his thumb against the window and the whole world disappeared behind it. It was the most moving experience of his life. As the spacecraft re-emerged from the darkness, Lovell was first to announce the good news. ""Please be advised,"" he said as the radio crackled back into life, ""there is a Santa Claus."" At that very moment, 239,000 miles away, a man in a blue Rolls-Royce pulled up outside Lovell's house in Houston. He walked past the dozens of reporters camped outside and handed a box to Marilyn. She opened the star-patterned tissue paper and pulled out a mink jacket. ""Happy Christmas,"" said the card that came with it, ""and love from the Man in the Moon."" Getty Images President Lyndon B Johnson, like millions of others, sat glued to his television sets during the Apollo 8 mission They went up as astronauts and came down celebrities. The people of the Earth had followed their every move on TV. There were ticker tape parades, congressional honours and a place on the cover of Time Magazine. And they had not even set foot on the Moon. That honour went, of course, to Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin. A year later, Kennedy's dream was posthumously seen to fruition. A small step was taken and mankind took its giant leap. The New Nine had done their job. 'Houston, we've had a problem' In April 1970, it was Jim Lovell's turn. Fortunately, the crew of Apollo 13 did not believe in unlucky numbers. Lovell, Jack Swigert and Fred Haise were men of science - highly trained and determined to follow Armstrong and Aldrin to the lunar surface. But things went badly wrong. They were 200,000 miles above the Earth and closing in on their target when they needed to stir tanks containing vital oxygen and hydrogen. Swigert flicked the switch. It should have been a routine procedure but the command module, Odyssey, shuddered. Oxygen pressure fell and power shut down. ""I believe we've had a problem here,"" said Swigert. Lovell had to repeat the message to a stunned Mission Control: ""Houston, we've had a problem."" It was one of the greatest understatements of all time. The crew were in big trouble - a dramatic explosion had disabled their craft. Getty Images Flight controllers at Nasa working out how to get the crippled Apollo 13 back to Earth. Haise and Lovell worked frantically to boot up the lunar module, Aquarius. It was not supposed to be used until they got to the Moon. It had no heat shield, so could not be used to re-enter the Earth's atmosphere. But it could keep them alive until they got there. The world stopped breathing and watched. For a second time, Jim Lovell had brought the world together as one. The first time it had been for Earthrise, the second would be to witness his fight to survive. “For four days,"" said Marilyn, ""I didn’t know if I was a wife or a widow."" Temperatures fell to freezing, food and water were rationed. It was days before they limped back to the fringes of Earth's atmosphere. They climbed back aboard the Odyssey and prayed the heat shield had not been damaged. The radio silence that accompanies re-entry went on far longer than normal. Millions watched on TV, many convinced that all was lost. After six agonising minutes, Jack Swigert's voice cut through the silence. The team on the ground held its breath until the parachutes deployed and the crew was safely down. The mission was Nasa's greatest failure and, without question, its finest hour. Getty Images Jim Lovell, Fred Haise and Jack Swigert are rescued from the Pacific Ocean after their dramatic escape Lovell retired from the navy in 1973 and opted for a the quiet life, working for the Bay-Houston Towing Company, giving speeches and serving as president of the National Eagle Scout Association. His book, Lost Moon: The Perilous Voyage of Apollo 13, became the famous 1995 movie, starring Tom Hanks as Jim Lovell. For the film, the director asked him to dress up as an admiral. It was for a cameo scene, shaking hands with Hanks when the crew were rescued from the sea. But the old American hero was not having it. Jim Lovell had been to the Moon twice, witnessed Earthrise and narrowly avoided a cold death in space - and saw no reason to falsely burnish his résumé . He took out his old navy uniform, dusted it down and put it on for the cameo appearance. ""I retired as a captain,"" he insisted, ""and a captain I will be.""

24725bf26a31,Nasa Apollo missions: Stories of the last Moon men,,"Nasa Apollo missions: Stories of the last Moon men NASA Who will be the next human to leave their footprint on the surface of the Moon? They were the pioneers of space exploration - the 24 Nasa astronauts who travelled to the Moon in the Apollo missions of the 1960s and 1970s. The death of Apollo 13 commander Jim Lovell , who guided the stricken mission safely back to Earth in 1970 , means there are now just five people remaining who have escaped the relative safety of Earth orbit and ventured deeper into space. More than 50 years since a human last set foot on the Moon, the race to put people back on the lunar surface is heating up once again. Nasa hopes its Artemis programme will lead to astronauts living on the Moon this decade. China is also aiming to have people on the lunar surface by 2030, having landed a probe on the far side of the Moon in June 2024. A number of private companies have tried to send scientific craft to the Moon, although the mishaps have outnumbered the successes . Nasa had intended to launch Artemis 2, its first crewed lunar expedition since Apollo 17 in 1972, last year but that date has slipped into 2026 , as the space agency says it needs more time to prepare. Meanwhile, companies such as SpaceX and Boeing continue to develop their own technology, although not without their setbacks. The issues with Boeing's Starliner which left two astronauts stranded on the International Space Station were embarrassing for the aerospace giant, while the ""rapid unscheduled disassemblies"" of SpaceX's Starship have become a customary sight to space watchers. These delays highlight the sad fact that the number of remaining Apollo astronauts is dwindling. NASA Apollo 13 was Jim Lovell's final mission Along with Frank Borman and Bill Anders, Jim Lovell made history when the three undertook the first lunar mission on Apollo 8, testing the Command/Service Module and its life support systems in preparation for the later Apollo 11 landing. Their craft actually made 10 orbits of the Moon before returning home. Lovell was later supposed be the fifth human to walk on the lunar surface as commander of Apollo 13 - but of course, that never happened. Instead the story of his brush with death was immortalised in the film Apollo 13, in which he was played by Tom Hanks. Watch: Moment Jim Lovell told earth ""Houston, we've had a problem"" as Apollo 13 suffered a fault Following his retirement from Nasa in 1973, Lovell worked in the telecoms industry. Marilyn, his wife of more than 60 years, who became a focus for the media during the infamous incident, died in August 2023. But what of the remaining five Moon men? Who are they, and what are their stories? Buzz Aldrin (Apollo 11) NASA Buzz Aldrin, right, along with his crewmates Neil Armstrong and Michael Collins, before their mission to the Moon On 21 July 1969, former fighter pilot Edwin ""Buzz"" Aldrin left his lunar landing craft and became the second person to step on the surface of the Moon. Almost 20 minutes beforehand, his commander, Neil Armstrong, had been the first. Aldrin's first words were: ""Beautiful view"". ""Isn't that something?"" asked Armstrong.""Magnificent sight out here."" ""Magnificent desolation,"" replied Aldrin. The fact that he was second never sat comfortably with him. His crewmate Michael Collins said Aldrin ""resented not being first on the Moon more than he appreciated being second"". But Aldrin was still proud of his achievement; many years later, when confronted by a man claiming Apollo 11 was an elaborate lie, the 72-year-old Aldrin punched him on the jaw. And following Neil Armstrong's death in 2012, Aldrin said: ""I know I am joined by many millions of others from around the world in mourning the passing of a true American hero and the best pilot I ever knew."" Despite struggles in later life, he never lost his thirst for adventure and joined expeditions to both the North and South Poles, the latter at the age of 86. Allow X content?

""I don't think we should just go there and come back - we did that with Apollo,"" he says. And his name has become known to new generations as the inspiration for Buzz Lightyear from the Toy Story series of films. In January 2023, at the age of 93, he married for a fourth time.. Charles Duke (Apollo 16) There are only four people still alive who have walked on the Moon - Charlie Duke is one of them. He did it aged 36, making him the youngest person to set foot on the lunar surface. In a later BBC interview, he spoke of a ""spectacular terrain"". ""The beauty of it… the sharp contrast between the blackness of space and the horizon of the Moon… I'll never forget it. It was so dramatic."" But he had already played another significant role in Nasa's exploration of the Moon. After Apollo 11 touched down in 1969, it was Duke - in mission control as the Capsule Communicator, or Capcom - who was waiting nervously on the other end of the line when Neil Armstrong said: ""Houston, Tranquility Base here. The Eagle has landed."" NASA Charlie Duke, along with Jim Lovell and Fred Haise in Mission Control, during the Apollo 11 mission In his distinctive southern drawl, Duke replied: ""Roger, Tranquility. We copy you on the ground, you've got a bunch of guys about to turn blue, we're breathing again."" ""I really meant it, I was holding my breath the last minute or so,"" he later told the BBC . In 2022, Duke told the BBC he was excited about Nasa's Artemis mission - but warned that it wouldn't be easy for the new generation of astronauts. ""They've picked near the South Pole for the landing, because if there's any ice on the Moon, it would be down in that region. So that's gonna be difficult - because it's really rough down there. But we'll pull it off."" Charlie Duke now lives outside San Antonio, Texas, with Dorothy, to whom he has been married for 60 years. Fred Haise NASA Fred Haise and his crewmates seemed surprised by their celebrity after they returned to Earth. Fred Haise was part of the crew of Apollo 13 that narrowly avoided disaster in 1970 after an on-board explosion caused the mission to be aborted when the craft was more than 200,000 miles (321,000km) from Earth. The whole world watched nervously as Nasa attempted to return the damaged spacecraft and its crew safely. Once back, Haise and his crewmates James Lovell and Jack Swigert became celebrities, to their apparent surprise. ""I feel like maybe I missed something while I was up there,"" he told talk show host Johnny Carson when the crew appeared on The Tonight Show. Haise never made it to the Moon. Although scheduled to be commander of Apollo 19, that mission was cancelled because of budget cuts, as were all other flights after Apollo 17. He later served as a test pilot on the prototype space shuttle, Enterprise. Like many of his fellow Apollo alumni, after leaving Nasa, Haise continued to work in the aerospace industry until his retirement. Harrison Schmitt (Apollo 17) NASA Harrison Schmitt was the first scientist to visit the Moon Unlike most other astronauts of the time, Schmitt had not served as a pilot in the US forces. A geologist and academic, he initially instructed Nasa astronauts on what to look for during their geological lunar field trips before becoming a scientist-astronaut himself in 1965. Schmitt was part of the last crewed mission to the Moon, Apollo 17, and along with commander Eugene Cernan, one of the last two men to set foot on the lunar surface, in December 1972. After leaving Nasa in 1975, he was elected to the US Senate from his home state of New Mexico, but only served one term. Since then he has worked as a consultant in various industries as well as continuing in academia. He is also known for speaking out against the scientific consensus on climate change. David Scott (Apollo 15) NASA David Scott was the seventh person to walk on the Moon David Scott, the commander of Apollo 15, is one of just four men alive who have walked on the Moon - but he was also one of the first to drive on it too. In 1971, Scott and crewmate James Irwin tested out the Lunar Roving Vehicle (LRV), ""Man's First Wheels on the Moon"" as it was called. Travelling at speeds up to 8 mph (12 km/h) the LRV allowed astronauts to travel large distances from the lunar lander much quicker than they could walk. ""On a first mission you never know whether it's going to work,"" he later recalled. ""The greatest thrill was to get it out, turn it on, and it actually worked."" After returning from the Moon, Scott worked in various management roles within Nasa, before joining the private sector. He has also acted as consultant on several film and television projects, including Apollo 13 and the HBO miniseries From The Earth To The Moon.

According to Politico, the acting head of Nasa referred to similar plans by China and Russia and said those two countries ""could potentially declare a keep-out zone"" on the Moon. But questions remain about how realistic the goal and timeframe are, given recent and steep Nasa budget cuts, and some scientists are concerned that the plans are driven by geopolitical goals. Nations including the US, China, Russia, India and Japan are rushing to explore the Moon's surface, with some planning permanent human settlements. ""To properly advance this critical technology to be able to support a future lunar economy, high power energy generation on Mars, and to strengthen our national security in space, it is imperative the agency move quickly,"" US transport secretary Sean Duffy, who was appointed temporary head of Nasa by President Donald Trump, wrote to Nasa, according to the New York Times. Mr Duffy called for proposals from commercial companies to build a reactor that could generate at least 100 kilowatts of power. This is relatively small. A typical on-shore wind turbine generates 2-3 megawatts. The idea of building a nuclear reactor as a power source on the Moon is not new. In 2022 Nasa issued three $5m contracts to companies to design a reactor. And in May this year, China and Russia announced they plan to build an automated nuclear power station on the Moon by 2035. Many scientists agree that it would be the best or perhaps only way to provide continuous power on the lunar surface. One lunar day is equivalent to four weeks on Earth, made up of two weeks of continual sunshine and two weeks of darkness. That makes relying on solar power very challenging. CNSA/CLEP In 2020 China planted a flag on the Moon on its Chang'e-5 mission ""Building even a modest lunar habitat to accommodate a small crew would demand megawatt-scale power generation. Solar arrays and batteries alone cannot reliably meet those demands,"" suggests Dr Sungwoo Lim, senior lecturer in space applications, exploration and instrumentation at the university of Surrey ""Nuclear energy is not just desirable, it is inevitable,"" he adds. Lionel Wilson, professor of earth and planetary sciences at Lancaster University, believes it is technically possible to place the reactors on the Moon by 2030 ""given the commitment of enough money"", and he highlights that there are already designs for small reactors. ""It's just a matter of having enough Artemis launches to build the infrastructure on the Moon by then,"" he adds, referring to Nasa's Artemis spaceflight programme that aims to send people and equipment to the Moon. There are also some questions around safety. ""Launching radioactive material through the Earth's atmosphere brings safety concerns. You have to have a special license to do that, but it is not insurmountable,"" says Dr Simeon Barber, planetary science specialist at the Open University. Mr Duffy's directive came as a surprise following recent turmoil in Nasa after Mr Trump's administration announced cuts of 24% to Nasa's budgets in 2026. That includes cuts to a significant number of science programmes such as the Mars Sample Return that aims to return samples from the planet's surface to Earth. Scientists are also concerned that this announcement is a politically-motivated move in the new international race to the Moon. ""It seems that we're going back into the old first space race days of competition, which, from a scientific perspective, is a little bit disappointing and concerning,"" says Dr Barber. ""Competition can create innovation, but if there's a narrower focus on national interest and on establishing ownership, then you can lose sight of the bigger picture which is exploring the solar system and beyond,"" he adds. Mr Duffy's comments about the potential for China and Russia to potentially ""declare a keep-out zone"" on the Moon appear to be referring to an agreement called the Artemis accords. In 2020 seven nations signed the agreement to establish principles on how countries should co-operate on the Moon's surface. The accords include so-called safety zones to be established around operations and assets that countries build on the Moon. ""If you build a nuclear reactor or or any kind of base on the moon, you can then start claiming that you have a safety zone around it, because you have equipment there,"" says Dr Barber. ""To some people, this is tantamount to, 'we own this bit of the moon, we're going to operate here and and you can't come in',"" he explains. Dr Barber points out that there are hurdles to overcome before placing a nuclear reactor on the Moon for humans to use. Nasa's Artemis 3 aims to send humans to the lunar surface in 2027, but it has faced a series of set-backs and uncertainty around funding. ""If you've got nuclear power for a base, but you've got no way of getting people and equipment there, then it's not much use,"" he added. ""The plans don't appear very joined up at the moment,"" he said.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cev2dylxv74o,Science,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/7fdf/live/4bea4430-71ec-11f0-a178-03cc5fabe4bc.png,2025-08-05T11:36:24.551000+00:00,396e7ddcaa00ffe104fcff1b293a1d2876dfb1d1

Kosmos 482, which launched in 1972 on a mission to Venus, never made it out of Earth's orbit and instead broke into four pieces that have been circling the planet for more than five decades. The EU Space Surveillance and Tracking centre (SST) said one fragment - believed to be the lander - ""most likely"" re-entered the atmosphere at about 06:16 GMT (07:16 BST) on Saturday. It is unclear whether the object fell to the ground or burned up in the atmosphere. It is also unclear exactly where the object re-entered the atmosphere. While there is much experts do not know about the object's re-entry, 70% of Earth is covered by sea so it is unlikely to have caused significant damage. ""It's much more likely that you win the lottery than that you get impacted by this piece of space debris,"" Stijn Lemmens, a senior analyst at the European Space Agency, said. Kosmos 482's lander capsule was built to survive the extreme heat and pressure of Venus's atmosphere, meaning it had a robust heat shield and durable structure. This is why experts think it may have survived an uncontrolled descent through Earth's atmosphere. However, Kosmos 482's parachute system, originally intended to slow the lander's descent towards Venus, is likely to have degraded after more than 50 years in space. Mr Lemmens explained that the ""re-entry of human-made objects into Earth's atmosphere occurs quite frequently"". He said it happens weekly for bigger spacecraft and daily for smaller ones. Objects typically burn up in the earth's atmosphere before they reach the ground. China's Long March 5B booster re-entered over the Indian Ocean in 2022, and the Tiangong-1 space station mostly burned up over the Pacific in 2018. Kosmos 482 is now being closely tracked by international space agencies. Mr Lemmens said that future spacecraft ""should be designed in such a way that they can take themselves out of orbit safely, preferably by doing controlled re-entries"". This would allow for precise predictions of landing locations, reducing the risk of any debris impacting populated areas and protecting people and property while ""managing the environmental impact of space debris"".",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy9vz28nyedo,Science,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/05e3/live/433cd260-2b21-11f0-a926-032a6ac0e498.jpg,2025-05-10T15:32:19.900000+00:00,82c18bb045de213f141a5469344420205c034da9
f2295447d595,The truth about life on other planets - and what it means for humans,,"The truth about life on other planets - and what it means for humans Pallab Ghosh Science correspondent BBC Listen to this article on BBC Sounds There are some scientific discoveries that do much more than advance our knowledge: they create a shift in our psyche as they show us the scale of the Universe and our place in it. One such moment was when space craft sent back images of the Earth for the first time. Another is the discovery of life on another world, a moment that has inched a little closer today with the news that signs of a gas, which on Earth is produced by simple marine organisms, has been found on a planet called K2-18b. Now, the prospect of really finding alien life - meaning we are not alone in the Universe - is not far away, according to the scientist leading the team that made the detection. ""This is basically as big as it gets in terms of fundamental questions, and we may be on the verge of answering that question,"" says Prof Nikku Madhusudhan of the Institute of Astronomy at Cambridge University. But all of this prompts even more questions, including, if they do find life on another world, how will this change us as a species? Flying saucers and sci-fi aliens Our ancestors have long created stories of beings that might dwell in the skies. In the early 20th Century, astronomers thought they could see straight line features on the Martian surface, raising speculation that one of our nearest planets might be home to an advanced civilisation: an idea that spawned a wealth of pulp science fiction culture involving flying saucers and little green aliens. It was during an era when western governments generated fear of the spread of communism, so visitors from outer space were more often than not portrayed as menaces, bringing peril rather than hope. But decades on, what has been described as ""the strongest evidence yet"" of life on another world has come, not from Mars or Venus, but from a planet hundreds of trillions of miles away orbiting a distant star. Reuters Nasa estimates that there are at least 100 billion planets in our galaxy Part of the challenge when it comes to researching the existence of alien life  is knowing where to look. Until relatively recently, the focus for Nasa's search for life was Mars, but that began to change in 1992 with the discovery of the first planet orbiting another star outside of our solar system. Although astronomers had suspected that there were other worlds around distant stars there had been no proof until that point. Since then, nearly 6,000 planets outside our solar system have been discovered. Many are so-called gas giants, like Jupiter and Saturn in our solar system. Others are either too hot or too cold to support liquid water, thought to be essential for life. But many are in what astronomers call ""The Goldilocks Zone"" where the distance is ""just right"" to support life. Prof Madhusudhan believes there could be thousands in our galaxy. Breathtakingly ambitious tech As these so-called exoplanets were being discovered, scientists began to develop instruments to analyse the chemical composition of their atmospheres. Their ambition was breathtaking, some would say audacious. The idea was to capture the tiny amount of starlight glancing through the atmospheres of these faraway worlds and study them for chemical fingerprints of molecules, which on Earth can only be produced by living organisms, so-called biosignatures. And they succeeded in developing such instruments for ground and space-based telescopes. Nasa's James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), which detected the gas on the planet called K2-18b in this week's discovery, is the most powerful space telescope ever built and its launch in 2021 generated excitement that the search for life was at long last within humanity's grasp. NASA Nasa's James Webb Space Telescope detected the gas on K2-18b in this week's discovery But JWST has its limits - it can't detect faraway planets as small as ours or as close to their parent stars, because of the glare. So, Nasa is planning the Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO), scheduled for the 2030s, which will be able to spot and sample the atmospheres of planets similar to our own. (This is possible using what is effectively a high-tech sunshield that minimises light from the star which a planet orbits.) Also coming online later this decade is the European Southern Observatory (ESO)'s Extremely Large Telescope (ELT), which will be on the ground, looking up at the crystal-clear skies of the Chilean desert. It has the largest mirror of any instrument built, 39-metres in diameter, and so can see vastly more detail at planetary atmospheres than its predecessors. More discoveries, more questions Prof Madhusudan, however, hopes to have enough data within two years to demonstrate categorically that he really has discovered the biosignatures around K2-18b. But even if he does achieve his aim, this won't lead to mass celebrations about the discovery of life on another world. Instead, it will be the start of another robust scientific debate about whether the biosignature could be produced by non-living means. Reuters Until relatively recently, the focus for Nasa's search for life was Mars Eventually though, as more data is gathered from more atmospheres and as chemists fail in finding alternative explanations for biosignatures, the scientific consensus will slowly and gradually shift towards the probability that life does exist on other worlds, according to Prof Catherine Heymans, from Edinburgh University, who is Scotland's Astronomer Royal. ""With more time on telescopes, astronomers will get a clearer vision of the chemical compositions of these atmospheres. You won't know that it's definitely life. But I think the more data that's built up, and that if you see this in multiple different systems, not just this one particular planet, it gives us more confidence"". The world wide web emerged in a series of incremental technological breakthroughs that didn't necessarily feel of enormous consequence at the time. In similar fashion, it may dawn on people that possibly the most enormous scientific, cultural and social transformation in the whole of human history has happened, but that the moment the balance was tipped in terms of there being other life out there was not fully recognised at the time. Getty Images A working prototype of the ExoMars rover A much more definitive discovery would be to discover life in our own solar system using robotic space craft containing portable laboratories. Any off-world bug could be analysed, possibly even brought back to Earth, providing prima facie evidence to at least significantly limit any scientific push back that may ensue. The scientific case for the possibility of life or past life in our own solar system has increased in recent years following data sent back by various spacecraft, so several missions to search for signs of it are on their way. The European Space Agency's (ESA) ExoMars rover, planned for launch in 2028, will drill below the surface of Mars to search for signs of past and possibly present life. Given the extreme conditions on Mars, however, the discovery of fossilised past life is the more likely outcome. China's Tianwen-3 mission, also planned for launch in 2028 is designed to collect samples and bring them back to Earth by 2031. Nasa and ESA each have spacecraft on their way to the icy moons of Jupiter to see if there may be water, possibly vast oceans, under their icy surfaces. NASA/ Reuters JWST has its limits - it can't detect faraway planets as small as ours But the spacecraft are not designed to find life itself.  Instead, these missions lay the ground for future missions which will, according to Prof Michele Dougherty of Imperial College, London. ""It is a long, slow process,"" she says. ""The next decision to make would be a lander, which moon it goes to, and where we should be landing. ""You don't want to land where the ice crust is so thick that there is no way you can get underneath the surface. And so, it's a long, slow burn, but it's pretty exciting en route"". Nasa is also sending a spacecraft called Dragonfly to land on one of the moons of Saturn, Titan in 2034. It is an exotic world with what are thought to be lakes and clouds made from carbon-rich chemicals which give the planet an eerie orange haze, bringing The Beatles‘ song, Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds to mind: a world with ""marmalade skies"". Along with water these chemicals are thought to be a necessary ingredient for life. Prof Dougherty is one of the leading planetary scientists in her field. Does she think there is life on one of the icy Moons of Jupiter or Saturn? ""I'd be very surprised if there wasn't,"" she says, beaming with delight. ""Three things are required: a heat source, liquid water and organic (carbon-based) chemicals. If we have those three ingredients, the chances that life is able to form rises really steeply. Reducing human 'specialness' If simple life forms are found to exist that is no guarantee that more complex life forms are out there. Prof Madhusudhan believes that, if confirmed, simple life should be ""pretty common"" in the galaxy. ""But going from that simple life to complex life is a big step, and that is an open question. How that step happens? What are the conditions that govern that? We don't know that. And then going from there to intelligent life is another big step."" NASA The prospect of finding alien life is not far away, according to some scientists Dr Robert Massey, who is the deputy executive director of the Royal Astronomical Society, agrees that the emergence of intelligent life on another world is much less likely than simple life. ""When we see the emergence of life on Earth, it was so complex. It took such a long time for multi-cellular life to emerge and then evolve into diverse life forms. ""The big question is whether there was something about the Earth that made that evolution possible. Do we need exactly the same conditions, our size, our oceans and land masses for that to happen on other worlds or will that happen regardless?"" He believes that the discovery of even simple alien life would be the latest chapter in the diminution of humanity's place in the cosmos. NASA Many working in the field believe that it is a matter of when, rather than if, they discover life on other worlds As he puts it, centuries ago, we believed we were at the centre of the Universe and with each discovery in astronomy we have found ourselves ""more displaced"" from that point. ""I think the discovery of life elsewhere it would further reduce our specialness,"" he says. Prof Dougherty, on the other hand, believes that such a discovery in our own solar system would be good for science, and good for the soul. ""The discovery of even simple life will allow us a better understanding about how we might have evolved way back those millions of aeons ago when we first evolved. And so, for me, it's helping us find our place in the Universe. ""If we know there is life, elsewhere in our solar system and potentially beyond, [this] would somehow be comforting to me, knowing that we're a fabric of something larger will make us bigger"". NASA As exoplanets were being discovered, scientists began to develop instruments to analyse the chemical composition of their atmospheres Never before have scientists searched so hard for life on other worlds and never before have they had such incredible tools to do this with. And many working in the field believe that it is a matter of when, rather than if, they discover life on other worlds. And rather than bringing fear, the discovery of alien life will bring hope, according to Prof Madhusudhan. ""When we would look at the sky, we would see not just physical objects, stars and planets, we would see a living sky. The societal ramifications of that are immense. It will be a huge transformational change in the way we look at ourselves in the cosmic scene. ""It will fundamentally change the human psyche in how we view ourselves and each other, and any barriers, linguistic, political, geographical, will dissolve, as we realise we are all one. And that will bring us closer,"" he continues. ""It will be another step in our evolution"".

971f3e593c8b,Astronauts Butch and Suni finally back on Earth,,"Astronauts Butch and Suni finally back on Earth Rebecca Morelle, Alison Francis and Greg Brosnan BBC Science Watch: Astronauts return to Earth after extended stay in Space After nine months in space, Nasa astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams have finally arrived back on Earth. Their SpaceX capsule made a fast and fiery re-entry through the Earth's atmosphere, before four parachutes opened to take them to a gentle splashdown off the coast of Florida. A pod of dolphins circled the craft. After a recovery ship lifted it out of the water, the astronauts beamed and waved as they were helped out of the hatch, along with fellow crew members astronaut Nick Hague and cosmonaut Aleksandr Gorbunov. ""The crew's doing great,"" Steve Stich, manager, Nasa's Commercial Crew Program, said at a news conference. It brings to an end a mission that was supposed to last for just eight days. It was dramatically extended after the spacecraft Butch and Suni had used to travel to the International Space Station suffered technical problems. ""It is awesome to have crew 9 home, just a beautiful landing,"" said Joel Montalbano, deputy associate administrator, Nasa's Space Operations Mission Directorate. Thanking the astronauts for their resilience and flexibility, he said SpaceX had been a ""great partner"". The journey home took 17 hours. The astronauts were helped on to a stretcher, which is standard practice after spending so long in the weightless environment. They will be checked over by a medical team, and then reunited with their families. NASA Triumphant - Suni Williams exits the capsule ""The big thing will be seeing friends and family and the people who they were expecting to spend Christmas with,"" said Helen Sharman, Britain's first astronaut. ""All of those family celebrations, the birthdays and the other events that they thought they were going to be part of - now, suddenly they can perhaps catch up on a bit of lost time."" The saga of Butch and Suni began in June 2024. They were taking part in the first crewed test flight of the Starliner spacecraft, developed by aerospace company Boeing. But the capsule suffered several technical problems during its journey to the space station, and it was deemed too risky to take the astronauts home. Starliner returned safely to Earth empty in early September, but it meant the pair needed a new ride for their return. So Nasa opted for the next scheduled flight: a SpaceX capsule that arrived at the ISS in late September. It flew with two astronauts instead of four, leaving two seats spare for Butch and Suni's return. The only catch was this had a planned six-month mission, extending the astronauts stay until now. The Nasa pair embraced their longer-than-expected stay in space. NASA Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams have been on the ISS since June 2024 They carried out an array of experiments on board the orbiting lab and conducted spacewalks, with Suni breaking the record for the woman who spent the most hours outside of the space station. And at Christmas, the team dressed in Santa hats and reindeer antlers - sending a festive message for a Christmas that they had originally planned to spend at home . And despite the astronauts being described as ""stranded"" they never really were. Throughout their mission there have always been spacecraft attached to the space station to get them - and the rest of those onboard - home if there was an emergency. Now the astronauts have arrived home, they will soon be taken to the Johnson Space Centre in Houston, Texas, where they will be checked over by medical experts. Long-duration missions in space take a toll on the body, astronauts lose bone density and suffer muscle loss. Blood circulation is also affected, and fluid shifts can also impact eyesight. It can take a long time for the body to return to normal, so the pair will be given an extensive exercise regime as their bodies re-adapt to living with gravity. British astronaut Tim Peake said it could take a while to re-adjust. ""Your body feels great, it feels like a holiday,"" he told the BBC. ""Your heart is having an easy time, your muscles and bones are having an easy time. You're floating around the space station in this wonderful zero gravity environment. ""But you must keep up the exercise regime. Because you're staying fit in space, not for space itself, but for when you return back to the punishing gravity environment of Earth. Those first two or three days back on Earth can be really punishing."" In interviews while onboard, Butch and Suni have said they were well prepared for their longer than expected stay - but there were things they were looking forward to when they got home. Speaking to CBS last month, Suni Williams said: ""I'm looking forward to seeing my family, my dogs and jumping in the ocean. That will be really nice -  to be back on Earth and feel Earth.""",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0mw221z2yyo,Science,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/1dd0/live/d396c300-0490-11f0-97d3-37df2b293ed1.jpg,2025-03-19T00:14:48.610000+00:00,7c4f000ec9d471f43aeb4fc8232cb993bc50e327

The target of the new research effort is Antarctic krill, which are just a couple of inches long and one of the most abundant and important animals on the planet. Marine wildlife - including whales, penguins, seals and seabirds – all feed on these diminutive creatures. However, conservation scientists are concerned that fishing and climate change could be having a negative impact on them and say we need new ways to monitor the creatures. WWF Dr Cait McCarry catching krill in a net in Antarctica in order to study the animals ""Antarctic krill are the superheroes of the Southern Ocean,"" said Rod Downie, chief polar adviser at the wildlife charity WWF-UK. ""They are tiny, unsung heroes that sustain incredible marine life, but climate change and unsustainable fishing are putting them at risk."" Researchers from the University of Strathclyde, WWF and the British Antarctic Survey (BAS) are developing a new way to use satellites to work out how many krill are in the ocean around Antarctica. WWF The scientists have started by studying how krill change the colour of seawater The key is in subtle differences in how much light seawater absorbs - depending on how many krill are swimming in it. Dr Cait McCarry, from the University of Strathclyde, has just returned from a trip to Antarctica, where she caught krill in order to measure this effect. ""We start with seawater, then we add in a krill and take a measurement [of how much light the water absorbs],"" she explained. ""Then we add another krill and take another measurement."" This analysis of exactly how the density of krill alters the colour of the ocean will, researchers say, allow them to take snapshots of the krill population from satellites - monitoring the population from Space. Victoria Gill/BBC The fluke of a humpback whale, which is feeding on krill in Antarctica Krill are food for some of the largest animals on the planet - including giant whales that migrate thousands of kilometres, to Antarctica, to feed on them. They are also the foundation of a healthy ocean - part of a virtuous cycle: Whales eat krill,  krill eat microscopic plants that live in sea ice, and those plants absorb planet-warming carbon as they grow. When whales poop (in vast quantities), that fertilises the planet-cooling marine plants. However, as the ocean temperatures rise with global warming, conservation scientists are concerned that this cycle could be disrupted, and that krill could be vulnerable. Mr Downie said: ""We urgently need to better manage the fishery and protect krill habitats within a network of marine protected areas.

757f6088f0db,"Asteroid contains building blocks of life, say scientists",,"Asteroid contains building blocks of life, say scientists Rebecca Morelle Science Editor and Alison Francis Senior Science Journalist NASA/Goddard/University of Arizona Asteroid Bennu is a 500m-wide pile of boulders, rocks and rubble The chemical building blocks of life have been found in the grainy dust of an asteroid called Bennu, an analysis reveals. Samples of the space rock, which were scooped up by a Nasa spacecraft and brought to Earth, contain a rich array of minerals and thousands of organic compounds. These include amino acids, which are the molecules that make up proteins, as well as nucleobases - the fundamental components of DNA. This doesn't mean there was ever life on Bennu, but it supports the theory that asteroids delivered these vital ingredients to Earth when they crashed into our planet billions of years ago. Scientists think those same compounds could also have been brought to other worlds in our Solar System. ""What we've learned from it is amazing,"" said Prof Sara Russell, a cosmic mineralogist from the Natural History Museum in London. ""It's telling us about our own origins, and it enables us to answer these really, really big questions about where life began. And who doesn't want to know about how life started?"" The findings are published in two papers in the journals Nature and Nature Astronomy. NASA/Erika Blumenfeld/Joseph Aebersold The grains of Bennu contain a vast array of organic molecules Grabbing a bit of Bennu has been one of the most audacious missions Nasa has ever attempted. A spacecraft called Osiris Rex unfurled a robotic arm to collect some of the 500m-wide space rock, before packing it into a capsule and returning it to Earth in 2023. About 120g of black dust was collected and shared with scientists around the world. This might not sound like much material, but it's proved to be a treasure trove. ""Every grain is telling us something new about Bennu,"" said Prof Russell, who's been studying the tiny specks. About a teaspoonful of the asteroid was sent to scientists in the UK. Natural History Museum/Tobias Salge Scanning electron microscopes revealed the minerals in the Bennu sample The new research has shown that the space rock is packed full of nitrogen and carbon-rich compounds. These include 14 of the 20 amino acids that life on Earth uses to build proteins and all four of the ring-shaped molecules that make up DNA  - adenine, guanine, cytosine and thymine. The study has also found an array of minerals and salts, suggesting water was once present on the asteroid. Ammonia, which is important for biochemical reactions, was discovered in the sample too. Some of these compounds have been seen in space rocks that have fallen to Earth, but others haven't been detected until now. ""It's just incredible how rich it is. It's full of these minerals that we haven't seen before in meteorites and the combination of them that we haven't seen before. It's been such an exciting thing to study,"" said Prof Russell. This latest study adds to growing evidence that asteroids brought water and organic material to Earth. ""The early Solar System was really turbulent and there were millions of asteroids like Bennu flying about,"" explained Dr Ashley King, from the Natural History Museum. The idea is that these bombarded the young Earth, seeding our planet with ingredients that gave us the oceans and made life possible. But Earth wasn't the only world getting hit by space rocks. Asteroids would have been colliding  with other planets too. ""Earth is unique, in that it's the only place where we have found life so far, but we know asteroids were delivering those ingredients, the carbon and the water, throughout the Solar System,"" said Dr King.

Officials at Elon Musk's company said the upper stage was lost after problems developed after lift-off from Texas on Thursday. But the Super Heavy booster managed to return to its launchpad as planned, prompting an eruption of applause from ground control teams. The mission came hours after the first flight of the Blue Origin New Glenn rocket system, backed by Amazon boss Jeff Bezos. The two tech billionaires both want to dominate the space vehicle market. ""Starship experienced a rapid unscheduled disassembly during its ascent burn. Teams will continue to review data from today's flight test to better understand root cause,"" SpaceX posted on X. ""With a test like this, success comes from what we learn, and today's flight will help us improve Starship's reliability."" Unverified footage shared on social media shows what appears to be the rocket breaking up in flames. And footage showed orange balls of light flying across the sky over the Haitian capital of Port-Au-Prince, leaving a trail of smoke behind. ""Success is uncertain, but entertainment is guaranteed!"" Mr Musk posted on X, sharing a video showing a fiery trail streaking though the sky. He also said ""improved versions"" of the ship and booster were ""already waiting for launch"". ""Preliminary indication is that we had an oxygen/fuel leak in the cavity above the ship engine firewall that was large enough to build pressure in excess of the vent capacity,"" Musk said a short while later, adding that ""nothing so far suggests pushing next launch past next month"". Footage of the launch clocked up 7.2m views, according to a SpaceX livestream. The Starship system had lifted off from Boca Chica, Texas, at 17:38 EST (22:38 GMT) in the company's seventh test mission. The Starship upper stage separated from its Super Heavy booster nearly four minutes into flight as planned. But then SpaceX communications manager Dan Huot reported on a live stream that mission teams had lost contact with the ship. The Super Heavy booster managed to return to its launchpad roughly seven minutes after lift-off as planned, prompting an eruption of applause from ground control teams. The US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) said it was aware ""an anomaly occurred"" during the SpaceX mission. ""The FAA briefly slowed and diverted aircraft around the area where space vehicle debris was falling. Normal operations have resumed,"" it said in a statement. It comes a day after a SpaceX rocket blasted off from Florida carrying two privately constructed lunar landers and a micro rover to the Moon.

c16073a579e2,Rocket launch challenges Elon Musk's space dominance,,"Rocket launch challenges Elon Musk's space dominance Georgina Rannard Climate and science reporter Watch: Lift-off for Jeff Bezos' Blue Origin as rocket New Glenn launches into orbit Amazon founder Jeff Bezos's space company has blasted its first rocket into orbit in a bid to challenge the dominance of Elon Musk's SpaceX. The New Glenn rocket launched from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in Florida at 02:02 local time (07:02 GMT). It firmly pits the world's two richest men against each other in a commercial space race, vying to fly bigger and more powerful rockets. Both want to populate the skies with more satellites, run private space stations, and provide transport for regular trips by people to the Moon. ""Congratulations on reaching orbit on the first attempt!"" Musk wrote in a post to Bezos on X. Dave Limp, CEO of Bezos's space company Blue Origin, said he was ""incredibly proud"". ""We'll learn a lot from today and try again at our next launch this spring,"" he added. Bezos's team overcame technical barriers that caused delays earlier this week when ice formation halted a launch. Blue Origin's employees and crowds gathered near Cape Canaveral cheered as the 98 meters-high rocket hurtled into orbit. But the company failed to land New Glenn's main rocket engine, or booster, onto a platform in the Atlantic Ocean. It had hoped that the booster would be reusable for future launches but after about 20 minutes of flight, the company confirmed it had lost the engine. Bezos's company Blue Origin has struggled to match the pace set by SpaceX. But this launch will be seen as a major step forward for the business. The New Glenn rocket was named after John Glenn, the first American astronaut to orbit Earth more than 60 years ago. The rocket is more powerful than SpaceX's most commonly used rocket, the Falcon 9. It can also carry more satellites, and Bezos wants to use it as part of his Project Kuiper, which aims to deploy thousands of low-earth satellites to provide broadband services. That project would compete directly with Musk's Starlink service. Blue Origin Media New Glenn is 98 metres high Jeff Bezos founded Blue Origin 25 years ago, claiming he wanted ""millions of people working and living in space."" For years the venture has sent a smaller, reusable rocket called New Shepard to the edge of Earth's atmosphere. It has carried passengers and payloads, including Bezos himself in 2021. But Blue Origin has been dramatically outperformed by SpaceX, which launched its rockets 134 times last year. And SpaceX's new generation of rocket, called Starship, is more powerful still. The company hopes to launch it in its seventh test flight later today. Starship is even bigger than Blue Origin's New Glenn Some experts say a successful New Glenn rocket will create real competition between the two companies and could drive down the costs of space operations. ""What you are going to see are these two companies challenge each other to make even greater strides,"" suggests Dr Simeon Barber at the Open University in the UK. Governments have historically spent billions on building rockets and sending missions into space. But US space agency NASA is increasingly moving away from relying only on public money and has issued huge contracts to private companies to provide rockets and other space services. Elon Musk's SpaceX has already received billions of dollars worth of space contracts. His close relationship with the next US president, Donald Trump, could strengthen his company further.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx24eg7z7zgo,Science,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/6525/live/7a47edf0-d3f4-11ef-94cb-5f844ceb9e30.jpg,2025-01-16T08:12:27.977000+00:00,3661a171715ccdad3e75ef8e8621296451f95418
6d5f7a45f97e,Future of space travel: Could robots really replace human astronauts?,,"Future of space travel: Could robots really replace human astronauts? Jonathan O’Callaghan BBC On Christmas Eve, an autonomous spacecraft flew past the Sun, closer than any human-made object before it. Swooping through the atmosphere, Nasa's Parker Solar Probe was on a mission to discover more about the Sun, including how it affects space weather on Earth. This was a landmark moment for humanity – but one without any human directly involved, as the spacecraft carried out its pre-programmed tasks by itself as it flew past the sun, with no communication with Earth at all. Robotic probes have been sent across the solar system for the last six decades, reaching destinations impossible for humans. During its 10-day flyby , the Parker Solar Probe experienced temperatures of 1000C. But the success of these autonomous spacecraft – coupled with the rise of new advanced artificial intelligence – raises the question of what role humans might play in future space exploration. NASA Artist's concept of the Parker Solar Probe spacecraft approaching the sun Some scientists question whether human astronauts are going to be needed at all. ""Robots are developing fast, and the case for sending humans is getting weaker all the time,"" says Lord Martin Rees, the UK's Astronomer Royal. ""I don't think any taxpayer's money should be used to send humans into space."" He also points to the risk to humans. ""The only case for sending humans [there] is as an adventure, an experience for wealthy people, and that should be funded privately,"" he argues. Andrew Coates, a physicist from University College London, agrees. ""For serious space exploration, I much prefer robotics,"" he says. ""[They] go much further and do more things."" NASA US astronaut Buzz Aldrin walking on the surface of the Moon in 1969 They are also cheaper than humans, he argues. ""And as AI progresses, the robots can be cleverer and cleverer."" But what does that mean for future generations of budding astronauts – and surely there are certain functions that humans can do in space but which robots, however advanced, never could? Rovers versus mankind Robotic spacecraft have visited every planet in the solar system, as well as many asteroids and comets, but humans have only gone to two destinations: Earth's orbit and the Moon. In all, about 700 people have been to space, since the earliest in 1961, when Yuri Gagarin from the then-Soviet Union became the first cosmic explorer. Most of those have been into orbit (circling the Earth) or suborbit (short vertical hops into space lasting minutes, on vehicles like the US company Blue Origin's New Shepard rocket). ""Prestige will always be a reason that we have humans in space,"" says Dr Kelly Weinersmith, a biologist at Rice University, Texas and co-author of A City on Mars. ""It seems to have been agreed upon as a great way to show that your political system is effective and your people are brilliant."" But aside from an innate desire to explore, or a sense of prestige, humans also carry out research and experiments in Earth's orbit, such as on the International Space Station, and use these to advance science. NASA The Earthrise photo was taken by US astronaut William Anders in December 1968 during the Apollo 8 mission Robots can contribute to that scientific research, with the ability to travel to locations inhospitable to humans, where they can use instruments to study and probe the atmospheres and surfaces. ""Humans are more versatile and we get stuff done faster than a robot, but we're really hard and expensive to keep alive in space,"" says Dr Weinersmith. In her 2024 Booker Prize-winning novel Orbital, author Samantha Harvey puts it more lyrically: ""A robot has no need for hydration, nutrients, excretion, sleep… It wants and asks for nothing."" But there are downsides. Many robots are slow and methodical – for example on Mars, the rovers (remote-controlled motor vehicles) trundle along at barely 0.1mph. ""AI can beat human beings at chess, but does that mean they'll be able to beat human beings in exploring environments?"" asks Dr Ian Crawford, a planetary scientist at the University of London. ""I just don't think we know."" He does, however, believe that AI algorithms might enable rovers to be ""more efficient"". AI assistants and humanoid robots Technology can play a part in complementing human space travel by freeing up astronauts from certain tasks to allow them to focus on more important research. ""[AI could be used to] automate tedious tasks,"" explains Dr Kiri Wagstaff, a computer and planetary scientist in the US who previously worked at Nasa's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in California. ""On the surface of a planet, humans get tired and lose focus, but machines won't."" The challenge is that vast amounts of power are needed to operate systems like large language models (LLM), which can understand and generate human language by processing vast amounts of text data. ""We are not at the point of being able to run an LLM on a Mars rover,"" says Dr Wagstaff. ""The rovers' processors run at about a tenth [of the speed] that your smartphone has"" – meaning they are unable to cope with the intense demands of running an LLM. Complex humanoid machines with robotic arms and limbs are another form of technology that could take on basic tasks and functions in space, particularly as they more closely mimic the physical capabilities of humans. NASA Nasa's Valkyrie humanoid robot Nasa's Valkyrie robot was built by the Johnson Space Center to compete in a 2013 robotics challenge trial. Weighing 300lb and standing at 6ft2in, it looks not unlike a Star Wars Stormtrooper, but it is one of an increasing number of human-like machines with superhuman abilities. Long before the Valkyrie was created, Nasa's Robonaut was the first humanoid robot designed for use in space, taking on tasks that were otherwise performed by humans. Its specially designed hands meant it could use the same tools as astronauts and carry out complex, delicate tasks like grasping objects or flicking switches, that were too challenging for other robotic systems. A later model of the Robonaut was flown to the International Space Station on the space shuttle Discovery in 2011, where it helped with maintenance and assembly. Reuters Valkyrie demonstrates how it is able to open a bag ""If we need to change a component or clean a solar panel, we could do that robotically,"" says Dr Shaun Azimi, lead of the dexterous robotics team at Nasa's Johnson Space Center in Texas. ""We see robots as a way to secure these habitats when humans aren't around."" He argues that robots could be useful, not to replace human explorers but to work alongside them. Some robots are already working on other planets without humans, sometimes even making decisions on their own. Nasa's Curiosity rover, for example, is exploring a region called Gale Crater on Mars and autonomously performs some of its science without human input. ""You can direct the rover to take pictures of a scene, look for rocks that might fit science priorities for the mission, and then autonomously fire its laser at that target,"" says Dr Wagstaff. ""It can get a reading of a particular rock and send it back to Earth while the humans are still asleep."" NASA Nasa's Perseverance Mars rover takes a ""selfie"" But the capabilities of rovers like Curiosity are limited by their slow pace. And there is something else they cannot compete with too. That is, humans have the added bonus of inspiring people back on Earth in a way that machines cannot. ""Inspiration is something that is intangible,"" argues Prof Coates. Leroy Chiao, a retired Nasa astronaut who went on three flights to space in the 1990s and 2000s on Nasa's Space Shuttle and to the International Space Station, agrees. ""Humans relate when humans are doing something. ""The general public is excited about robotic missions. But I would expect the first human on Mars to be even bigger than the first Moon landing."" Life on Mars? Humans have not travelled further than Earth's orbit since December 1972, when the last Apollo mission visited the Moon. Nasa is hoping to return humans there this decade with its Artemis programme. The next crewed mission will see four astronauts fly around the Moon in 2026. A further mission, scheduled for 2027, will see Nasa astronauts land on the Moon's surface. Reuters Astronauts for NASA's Artemis II mission The Chinese space agency, meanwhile, also wants to send astronauts to the Moon. Elsewhere Elon Musk, CEO of the US company SpaceX, has his own plans related to space. He has said that his long-term plan is to create a colony on Mars, where humans could land . His idea is to use Starship, a vast new vehicle that his company is developing, to transport up to 100 people there at a time, with the aim for there to be a million people on Mars in 20 years . ""Musk is arguing we need to move to Mars because that could be a backup for humanity if something catastrophic happens on Earth,"" explains Dr Weinersmith. ""If you buy that argument, then sending humans into space is necessary."" However, there are large unknowns about living on Mars, including myriad technical challenges that she says remain unsolved. ""Maybe babies can't develop in that environment,"" she says. ""There [are] ethical questions [like this] that we don't have the answers to. ""I think we should be slowing down."" Lord Rees has a vision of his own, though, in which human and robotic exploration might merge to the point that humans themselves are part-machine to cope with extreme environments. ""I can imagine they will use all of the techniques of genetic modification, cyborg add-ons, and so on, to cope with very hostile environments,"" he says. ""We may have a new species that will be happy to live on Mars."" Until then, however, humans are likely to continue their small steps into the cosmos, on a path long trodden by robotic explorers before them.

7a8f6f0e1256,New study on moons of Uranus raises chance of life,,"New study on moons of Uranus raises chance of life Pallab Ghosh Science Correspondent SPL Artwork: Uranus and its five largest moons had been thought to be inactive and sterile. The planet Uranus and its five biggest moons may not be the dead sterile worlds that scientists have long thought. Instead, they may have oceans, and the moons may even be capable of supporting life, scientists say. Much of what we know about them was gathered by Nasa’s Voyager 2 spacecraft which visited nearly 40 years ago. But a new analysis shows that Voyager's visit coincided with a powerful solar storm, which led to a misleading idea of what the Uranian system is really like. Uranus is a beautiful, icy ringed world in the outer reaches of our solar system. It is among the coldest of all the planets. It is also tilted on its side compared to all the other worlds – as if it had been knocked over – making it arguably the weirdest. We got our first close-up look at it in 1986, when Voyager 2 flew past and sent back sensational pictures of the planet and its five major moons. But what amazed scientists even more was the data Voyager 2 sent back indicating that the Uranian system was even weirder than they thought. The measurements from the spacecraft’s instruments indicated that the planets and moons were inactive, unlike the other moons in the outer solar system. They also showed that Uranus’s protective magnetic field was strangely distorted. It was squashed and pushed away from the Sun. A planet’s magnetic field traps any gases and other material coming off the planet and its moons. These might be from oceans or geological activity. Voyager 2 found none, suggesting that Uranus and its five largest moons were sterile and inactive. This came as an enormous surprise because it was unlike the solar system’s other planets and their moons. NASA Miranda, one of the moons of Uranus, photographed by Voyager 2. The new research says the moon possibly has a sub-surface ocean and may even be home to life NASA Voyager 2 was launched in 1977 to study Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune But the new analysis has solved the decades-long mystery. It shows that Voyager 2 flew past on a bad day. The new research shows that just as Voyager 2 flew past Uranus, the Sun was raging, creating a powerful solar wind that might have blown the material away and temporarily distorted the magnetic field. So, for 40 years we have had an incorrect view of what Uranus and its five largest moons are normally like, according to Dr William Dunn of University College London. “These results suggest that the Uranian system could be much more exciting than previously thought. There could be moons there that could have the conditions that are necessary for life, they might have oceans below the surface that could be teeming with fish!”. NASA The first picture of Uranus was sent back by Voyager 2 in 1986 Linda Spilker was a young scientist working on the Voyager programme when the Uranus data came in. She is now still serving as the project scientist for the Voyager missions. She said that she was delighted to hear about the new results, which have been published in the Journal Nature Astronomy. “The results are fascinating, and I am really excited to see that there is potential for life in the Uranian system,” she told BBC News. “I’m also so pleased that so much is being done with the Voyager data. It’s amazing that scientists are looking back at the data we collected in 1986 and finding new results and new discoveries”. Dr Affelia Wibisono of the Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies, who is independent of the research team, described the results as “very exciting”. “It shows how important it is to look back at old data, because sometimes, hiding behind them is something new to be discovered, which can help us design the next generation of space exploration missions”. Which is exactly what Nasa is doing, partly as a result of the new research. It has been nearly 40 years since Voyager 2 last flew past the icy world and its moons. Nasa has plans to launch a new mission, the Uranus Orbiter and Probe, to go back for a closer look in 10 years’ time. NASA Plumes of material coming from Enceladus, one of the moons of Saturn, indicating a possible sub-surface ocean. Could the same be true of the Uranian moons? According to Nasa’s Dr Jamie Jasinski, whose idea it was to re-examine the Voyager 2 data, the mission will need to take his results into account when designing its instruments and planning the scientific survey. “Some of the instruments for the future spacecraft are very much being designed with ideas from what we learned from Voyager 2 when it flew past the system when it was experiencing an abnormal event. So we need to rethink how exactly we are going to design the instruments on the new mission so that we can best capture the science we need to make discoveries”. Nasa’s Uranus probe is expected to arrive by 2045, which is when scientists hope to find out whether these far-flung icy moons, once thought of as being dead worlds, might have the possibility of being home to life.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cgk1333k0ypo,Science,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/36c3/live/d7d05950-9c2a-11ef-a65b-4d3707c63685.jpg,2024-11-11T16:00:05.358000+00:00,a937b3231828496b9bff94e1b83d5fdb9e312e15
76b5f34fc514,Renewables overtake coal as world's biggest source of electricity,,"Renewables overtake coal as world's biggest source of electricity Justin Rowlatt Climate Editor AFP via Getty Images Renewable energy overtook coal as the world's leading source of electricity in the first half of this year - a historic first, according to new data from the global energy think tank Ember. Electricity demand is growing around the world but the growth in solar and wind was so strong it met 100% of the extra electricity demand, even helping drive a slight decline in coal and gas use. However, Ember says the headlines mask a mixed global picture. Developing countries, especially China, led the clean energy charge but richer nations including the US and EU relied more than before on planet-warming fossil fuels for electricity generation. This divide is likely to get more pronounced, according to a separate report from the International Energy Agency (IEA).  It predicts renewables will grow much less strongly than forecast in the US as a result of the policies of President Donald Trump's administration. Coal, a major contributor to global warming, was still the world's largest individual source of energy generation in 2024, a position it has held for more than 50 years, according to the IEA. Even though China is still adding to its fleet of coal-fired power stations, it also remains way ahead in clean energy growth, adding more solar and wind capacity than the rest of the world combined. This enabled the growth in renewable generation in China to outpace rising electricity demand and helped reduce its fossil fuel generation by 2%. India experienced slower electricity demand growth and also added significant new solar and wind capacity, meaning it too cut back on coal and gas. In contrast, developed nations like the US, and also the EU, saw the opposite trend. In the US, electricity demand grew faster than clean energy output, increasing reliance on fossil fuels, while in the EU, months of weak wind and hydropower performance led to a rise in coal and gas generation. In a separate report the IEA has halved its forecast for the growth of renewable energy in the US this decade. Last year, the agency predicted the US would add 500GW of new renewable capacity – mostly from solar and wind – by 2030. That has been cut that back to 250GW. The IEA analysis represents the most thorough assessment to date of the impact the Trump administration's policies are having on global efforts to transition to cleaner energy sources and underscores the dramatically different approach of the US and China. As China's clean tech exports surge, the US is focusing on encouraging the world buy more of its oil and gas. Getty Images 'Crucial' turning point Despite these regional differences, Ember calls this moment a ""crucial turning point"". Ember senior analyst Malgorzata Wiatros-Motyka said it ""marks the beginning of a shift where clean power is keeping pace with demand growth"". Solar power delivered the lion's share of growth, meeting 83% of the increase in electricity demand. It has now been the largest source of new electricity globally for three years in a row. Most solar generation (58%) is now in lower-income countries, many of which have seen explosive growth in recent years. That's thanks to spectacular reductions in cost. Solar has seen prices fall a staggering 99.9% since 1975 and is now so cheap that large markets for solar can emerge in a country in the space of a single year, especially where grid electricity is expensive and unreliable, says Ember. Pakistan, for example, imported solar panels capable of generating 17 gigawatts (GW) of solar power in 2024, double the previous year and the equivalent of roughly a third of the country's current electricity generation capacity. Africa is also experiencing a solar boom with panel imports up 60% year on year, in the year to June. Coal-heavy South Africa led the way, while Nigeria overtook Egypt into second place with 1.7GW of solar generating capacity - that's enough to meet the electricity demand of roughly 1.8m homes in Europe. Some smaller African nations have seen even more rapid growth with Algeria increasing imports 33-fold, Zambia eightfold and Botswana sevenfold. In some countries the growth of solar has been so rapid it is creating unexpected challenges. In Afghanistan, widespread use of solar-powered water pumps is lowering the water table, threatening long-term access to groundwater. A study by Dr David Mansfield and satellite data firm Alcis warns that some regions could run dry within five to ten years, endangering millions of livelihoods. Adair Turner, chair of the UK's Energy Transitions Commission, says countries in the global ""sun belt"" and ""wind belt"" face very different energy challenges. Sun belt nations - including much of Asia, Africa, and Latin America - need large amounts of electricity for daytime air conditioning. These countries can significantly reduce energy costs almost immediately by adopting solar-based systems, supported by increasingly affordable batteries that store energy from day to night. Wind belt countries like the UK face tougher obstacles, however. Wind turbine costs have not come down by anything like as much as solar panels - down just a third or so in the last decade. Higher interest rates have also added to borrowing costs and raised the overall price of installing wind farms significantly in the last few years. Balancing supply is harder too: winter wind lulls can last for weeks, requiring backup power sources that batteries alone can't provide - making the system more expensive to build and run. But wherever you are in the world, China's overwhelming dominance in clean tech industries remains unchallenged, other new data from Ember shows. In August 2025, its clean tech exports hit a record $20bn, driven by surging sales of electric vehicles (up 26%) and batteries (up 23%). Together, China's electric vehicles and batteries are now worth more than twice the value of its solar panel exports.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx2rz08en2po,Science,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/43c1/live/9d78fac0-a2e4-11f0-ba2e-7d74c4f6f1cb.jpg,2025-10-07T11:37:45.818000+00:00,80293a250b6a491c95fa5ab4ec8c99250f35ee81
66f0921e99f3,Tories pledge to scrap landmark climate legislation,,"The Conservatives have pledged to scrap the UK's landmark climate change legislation and replace it with a strategy for ""cheap and reliable"" energy. The Climate Change Act 2008, which put targets for cutting emissions into law, was introduced by the last Labour government and strengthened under Tory PM Theresa May. Tory leader Kemi Badenoch said her party wanted to leave ""a cleaner environment for our children"" but argued ""Labour's laws tied us in red tape, loaded us with costs, and did nothing to cut global emissions"". Environmental groups said the move would be an act of ""national self-harm"", while Labour said it would be ""an economic disaster and a total betrayal of future generations"". Conservative ex-prime minister Baroness Theresa May criticised the decision as a ""retrograde step which upends 17 years of consensus between our main political parties and the scientific community"". ""To row back now would be a catastrophic mistake for while that consensus is being tested, the science remains the same,"" Baroness May added. The 2008 law, which was passed when current Energy Secretary Ed Miliband was in the same role in Gordon Brown's government, committed the UK to cutting carbon emissions by 80% by 2050. In 2019, under May's premiership, this legally binding target was updated to reaching net zero by 2050 - meaning the UK must cut carbon emissions until it removes as much as it produces. The legislation also established the Climate Change Committee, which advises the government on meeting the target and reports on progress towards reducing emissions. At the time, the law passed through Parliament with the support of all major parties. However, the political consensus on net zero has since fragmented. Badenoch has previously said the target of net zero by 2050 is ""impossible"" for the UK to meet and promised to ""maximise"" extraction of oil and gas from the North Sea . Reform UK has also said it would scrap net zero targets if it wins the next election , blaming the policy for higher energy bills and deindustrialisation in the UK. The UK was the first country to establish a long-term legally binding framework to cut carbon emissions, and since the act was passed many other countries have introduced similar legislation. However, the Tories said the act forced ministers ""to make decisions to meet arbitrary climate targets, even if they make the British people poorer, destroy jobs, and make our economy weaker"". The party argues that the 2008 law has ""forced successive governments to introduce punitive measures that have hit family finances"". As an example, it pointed to fines for boiler manufacturers who do not hit heat pump sales targets, which critics have branded a ""boiler tax"". The scheme, announced but then delayed by the previous Conservative government, came into force under Labour in April. The UK has high electricity costs, ranking the fourth highest for domestic consumers of medium usage when compared to other EU countries, and the highest for industrial usage. Labour says its plan to boost clean energy in Britain will reduce household energy bills by ""up to £300"" by 2030. However, earlier this year energy bills rose by 6% for a typical family. Badenoch said: ""We want to leave a cleaner environment for our children, but not by bankrupting the country. ""Climate change is real. But Labour's laws tied us in red tape, loaded us with costs, and did nothing to cut global emissions. Previous Conservative governments tried to make Labour's climate laws work - they don't. ""Under my leadership we will scrap those failed targets. Our priority now is growth, cheaper energy, and protecting the natural landscapes we all love."" However, Miliband said: ""This desperate policy from Kemi Badenoch if ever implemented would be an economic disaster and a total betrayal of future generations. ""The Conservatives would now scrap a framework that businesses campaigned for in the first place and has ensured tens of billions of pounds of investment in homegrown British energy since it was passed by a Labour government with Conservative support 17 years ago."" Former Conservative minister Lord Alok Sharma, who was president of the Cop 26 UN climate summit in 2021, said the last Conservative government had a legacy of ""global leadership"" on tackling climate change and urged Badenoch not to ""squander this for the sake of short-term political expediency"". The Liberal Democrats also criticised the announcement. The party's energy security and net zero spokesperson Pippa Heylings said: ""The reality is that investing in renewables is the greatest economic growth opportunity in this century and will protect the planet for future generations."" Meanwhile, Richard Benwell, chief executive of the Wildlife and Countryside Link coalition of environmental groups, said: ""The real route to lasting security is in homegrown clean power, not burning more fossil fuels. ""Without binding climate law, ministers will be free to trade away our future - and it is nature and the poorest communities that will pay the price.""",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/czrp2k3m3deo,Science,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/752b/live/bb9f6640-9ef4-11f0-b1c8-5d59c9f3a032.jpg,2025-10-02T16:21:23.593000+00:00,3b38645165d96877bb8286fa27d0f09d9add6367
1b42e702a98e,Ratmageddon: Why rats are overrunning our cities,,"Ratmageddon: Why rats are overrunning our cities Justin Rowlatt Climate Editor BBC Listen to Justin read this article One morning last year, John Gladwin opened the cupboard under his kitchen sink and discovered a bag of soil he'd been storing there was torn to shreds. Days later he noticed a pungent smell too. It was musty and slightly astringent, not unlike the communal bin area in his block of flats. ""I knew what it was straight away,"" he says. ""Rats."" He'd often seen them scurrying around near bins. Now they were inside his home too. ""I heard them in the cupboards and behind the bath panel. One morning when I woke up they were fighting under the bath, screaming and squealing."" Rodents on the estate in Croydon where John Gladwin lives - a brazen one jumped in a bin bag and pulled out a hunk of food Mr Gladwin, who lives in Croydon with his five children, acted immediately. He put down peppermint oil and rat poison and so far they haven't returned. But the experience shook him. ""I was worried for the children's health, I didn't want them catching anything."" There was another feeling too: shame. ""It's not nice to say we're infested, that our family is living in a rat-infested property."" Cleankill, the pest control company tasked with tackling the infestation on Mr Gladwin's estate, works across the south of England. Its founder, Clive Bury says he has seen a ""remarkable"" increase in call outs for rat activity, estimating a 20% increase in the last two years. Similar patterns are being reported across the country. Trade body the British Pest Control Association (BPCA) says more than half of the pest control companies who are members have seen an increased number of rat callouts over the last five years. Rats live in drains, sewers and burrows, and emerge mostly at night, so counting them is nearly impossible and estimates on rat population figures vary. In the UK it could be anywhere from 10 million to 120 million. What is known is that more than half a million rodent infestations were reported to UK councils, between 2023 and the middle of this year, according to Freedom of Information requests gathered by repair company, Drain Detectives. But it's not just affecting the UK. Rat numbers are reported to have spiked in several US cities too, including Washington DC, San Francisco and New York City, as well as in Amsterdam and Toronto. Though they're not inherently dirty animals, rats scavenge in sewers and bins and can pass on serious diseases to humans. Leptospirosis (Weil's disease) is transmitted through their urine, and hantavirus can be spread by breathing in infected droppings. They can also eat their way through farm produce and contaminate food supplies. So, given rats have shown themselves to be wily in avoiding being caught - what would it really take to stop them? Or are we too far gone to prevent rats from overrunning our cities? Rising temperatures, rising rat activity Bobby Corrigan calls himself an urban rodentologist. He started out as an exterminator in New York City and has spent his life immersed in rats. ""I ended up in sewers, trying to hang poison baits to kill rats."" Years later, while studying rats in college, he went to extreme lengths to understand their behaviours - once he slept on the floor of a rat-infested barn to observe it first hand. What astonished him was their complex social structure, and evidence of what he believed to be signs of altruism. ""I saw young rats carrying food and giving it to older rats that couldn't get around,"" he remembers. He was also determined to understand the reasons for the rise. The number of rats at this block of flats in Croydon is on the rise There are many possible reasons for this. Niall Gallagher, technical manager at the BPCA, says our growing appetite for fast food, the fact some councils collect rubbish less frequently, as well as road and building works disturbing the sewer network, all contribute. But there is evidence that rising temperatures might also be at play. Scientific evidence has found that rat populations are sensitive to temperature but Dr Corrigan, who previously worked at the New York City Department of Health as a research scientist, together with researchers from the University of Richmond, Virginia, set out to find out whether the rise in rat activity correlated to temperature increases. Their study examined 16 cities, mostly in North America, and the results, published in the journal Science Advances earlier this year, found that 11 of them recorded significant increases in rat activity over a period of between seven and 17 years. Bobby Corrigan Dr Bobby Corrigan once slept on the floor of a rat-infested barn to observe their behaviour patterns firsthand In Washington DC the increase was almost 400%, in San Francisco it was 300%, Toronto 180% and New York 160%. Only three cities saw declines, including Tokyo and New Orleans. ""Cities experiencing greater temperature increases over time saw larger increases in rats,"" the study found. Those increases approached 2C in some places during the study period. Dr Corrigan believes that - as long as temperatures continue to rise, and in particular winters become warmer - the increase in rat numbers is likely to continue. And global temperatures are indeed set to rise between at least 1.9C and 2.7C above the pre-industrial average by 2100, according to Climate Action Tracker, a group of independent climate researchers. Phenomenal breeders - until it's cold Rats are phenomenal breeders. A female typically has around six litters a year, each with up to 12 pups. Those rats can start breeding after nine weeks, meaning two rats can potentially create more than 1,000 offspring in a single year. Universal Images Group via Getty Images Rats don't hibernate, so when exposed to the cold, it can kill them  or result in them producing fewer pups, as baby rats are known – which slows population growth Researchers say numbers are particularly prone to increase in cities. That's because their  heat-trapping tarmac and buildings tend to warm more quickly than rural areas. And the trend of people moving from rural areas to cities is playing a part too, according to Dr Corrigan. ""Land is disappearing like crazy, and we're putting up buildings so we reduce their [rats] habitat in the wild,"" he says. Extra buildings means more nooks, pipes and drains for rats to live in. Which all adds to the challenge of how to best control growing populations. A surprising superpower One of the curious facts about rats - and one begins to explain why poison baits often don't work - is that they cannot vomit. In theory this means that once rat poison is ingested, they can't get rid of it. But rats are also ""neophobic"" or fearful of new things, according to Professor Steven Belmain, a professor of ecology at the University of Greenwich. He believes the two points are related. It is something of a ""superpower"", he says, as when they come across a potential food they don't just dive in. ""They will only try a little bit. So once they understand that they don't feel ill, they'll realise, 'okay, I can eat that'. ""You could argue that this cautious approach to life has stood them well."" Getty Images One expert says the solution comes down to focusing on our cities, not rat traps and poison baits Dr Alan Buckle of the University of Reading has spent 30 years working to develop new rat poisons but - he tells me with a laugh - ""I failed"". If a poison tastes bad or causes any discomfort or pain to a rat, they will not eat more. Which is why slower-acting substances, mainly anticoagulants - drugs that stop blood forming into clots - are used. These take up to a week to act, giving enough time for rats to eat a lethal dose. But they are recognised as a cruel way to die, killing the rats by causing internal bleeding. What's more, in recent years rats have developed genetic mutations that give them some immunity to these powerful drugs too. Some researchers are looking at the possibility of using oral contraceptives as an alternative, more humane way to prevent rat numbers growing further. On patrol with the Rat Tsar Few know this challenge better than Kathleen Corradi, a former schoolteacher who was appointed the city's Rat Tsar by the New York Mayor in 2023. An estimated three million rats live in the five boroughs and Corradi was reportedly awarded $3.5m (£2.6m) to increase public awareness about rat mitigation. She started what she calls a ""rat academy"" that teaches people how to stop their neighbourhood from being overrun by rats. New York City Hall Kathleen Corradi was appointed New York's ""Rat Tsar"" to tackle the city's rat problem ""They take a rat walk with me, where we go out into neighbourhoods, and we talk about human behaviour and we talk about rat behaviour,"" she told the BBC earlier this month. ""We talk about how it all comes together and what they could be doing in their neighbourhoods."" Her team also urged New York residents to phone in if they see rats or evidence of behaviours likely to encourage rats. Inspectors investigate the reports and order action, with stiff fines if it isn't taken. And there was another crucial change – instead of putting their rubbish out on the street in plastic bags, now most New Yorkers are obliged to put their waste in rat-proof bins. Getty Images In New York, residents must now use rat-proof bins to keep out rodents - like these Corradi is now leaving the role, but she says the approach is showing some progress. Ultimately, she explained, ""cutting off rats' food source is the key to a sustained reduction"". Overflowing bins and fast food Back in Croydon, Alex Donnovan, a pest controller for Cleankill, leads me into the backyard of the estate where John Gladwin lives. It is just after dawn, and he gestures for me to stay still and keep quiet. Moments later, there is a rustling and a rat darts from beneath the concrete walkway towards the communal bins. Next, the head of a large rat emerges from a burrow at the end of the garden. During the two hours we spent on the estate, some rats climbed high into a tree, while a particularly brazen one jumped into a bin and pulled a hunk of food from a plastic bag while I watched on, less than a metre away. Mr Donnovan believes it is almost impossible to get control of an infestation of this scale. ""There's just so much food."" He gestures to bins overflowing with rubbish bags. ""Even if we put down rodenticide, they won't eat it. They are just not interested… Once these bins are infested with rats, the bin men don't want to collect it either."" John Gladwin, who lives on the estate, says finding rats in his flat made him concerned for his children's health - it also made him feel ashamed Warmer temperatures may well help fuel growing rat populations but our overflowing bins, fondness for fast food and fractured communities all add to the challenge of keeping it under control. In the UK there are more people than ever are living in closer proximity. The Office for National Statistics projects the population will increase from 67.6 million in 2022 to 72.5 million by 2032, with the proportion living in urban areas growing too. So, instead of hoping poison will do the trick, the solution could come down to something far more straightforward. AFP via Getty Images Rats are thriving in cities, fuelled by overflowing bins, fast food and dense urban living ""If we take care of our city environment, then we won't have to worry about being so inhumane to them,"" argues Dr Corrigan. ""By not giving [rats access to] the food and scraps, then we don't have to poison them and kill them and torture them and all the crazy things we do to them."" The challenge now is how to do that, and at speed. After all, as he puts it, we have already ""underestimated them"". ""We ignored rats and let them get out of hand… and now we are paying the price.""

'Leopard-spot' rocks could be biggest clue yet Rebecca Morelle Science editor NASA/JPL The rocks are covered with unusual markings that look like leopard spots Unusual rocks discovered on Mars contain the most tantalising evidence yet of potential past life on the Red Planet. The mudstones, found in a dusty riverbed by Nasa's Perseverance Rover, are dotted with intriguing markings nicknamed leopard spots and poppy seeds. Scientists believe these features contain minerals produced by chemical reactions that could be associated with ancient Martian microbes. It's possible the minerals were produced by natural geological processes, but at a press conference Nasa said the features could be the clearest signs of life ever found. Watch: NASA finds ""clearest sign"" of ancient life on Mars The findings are significant enough to meet Nasa's criteria for what it calls ""potential biosignatures"". This means that they warrant further investigation to determine whether they are biological in origin. ""We've not had something like this before, so I think that's the big deal,"" said Prof Sanjeev Gupta, a planetary scientist from Imperial College London and one of the authors of a study which has been published in the journal Nature. ""We have found features in the rocks that if you saw them on Earth could be explained by biology - by microbial process. So we're not saying that we found life, but we're saying that it really gives us something to chase."" ""It's like seeing a leftover fossil. Maybe it was a leftover meal, maybe that meal's been excreted and that's what we're seeing here,"" Dr Nicola Fox, Nasa's Associate Administrator for the Science Mission Directorate, said in at the press conference. The only way to fully confirm if the minerals were made by microbes would be to bring the rocks back to Earth for analysis . A Mars sample return mission has been proposed by Nasa and Esa but its future looks highly uncertain.  The US Space Agency's science budget is facing huge cuts that have been put forward in President Trump's 2026 budget and a sample return mission is one of those facing cancellation. Today, Mars is a cold and arid desert. But billions of years ago there is evidence that it had a thick atmosphere and water, making it a promising place to look for past life. The Perseverance Rover, which touched down on the Martian surface in 2021, was sent to search for signs of biology. It has spent the last four years exploring a region called the Jezero Crater, which was once an ancient lake with a river flowing into it. The rover found the leopard print rocks last year at the bottom of a canyon carved out by the river in an area called the Bright Angel Formation. They are about 3.5bn years old and are a type of rock called mudstone, which is fine-grained rock formed from clays. ""We kind of immediately knew there was some interesting chemistry that had happened in these rocks so we were pretty excited right away,"" said Joel Hurowitz from Stony Brook University in New York, who is also a Perseverance mission scientist and lead author of the paper. The rover used several instruments in its onboard lab to analyse the minerals in the rocks. This data was then beamed back to Earth for scientists to study. ""We think what we've found is evidence for a set of chemical reactions that took place in the mud that was deposited at the bottom of a lake - and those chemical reactions seem to have taken place between the mud itself and organic matter - and those two ingredients reacted to form new minerals,"" explained Dr Hurowitz. In similar conditions on Earth, chemical reactions creating minerals are typically driven by microbes. ""That is one of the possible explanations for how these features came to be in these rocks,"" said Dr Hurowitz. ""This feels like the most compelling potential biosignature detection that we've had to date."" The scientists have also examined how the minerals could have formed without microbes - and concluded that natural geological processes could also be behind the chemical reactions. However they would require high temperatures, and the rocks don't look like they've been heated. ""We found some difficulties for the non-biological pathways - but we can't rule them out completely,"" Dr Hurowitz said. NASA/JPL Perseverance has collected samples of the intriguing rocks Perseverance has been collecting samples while it's been exploring Mars - including the rocks found at the Bright Angel Formation.  They have been stored in canisters, and will be deposited on the surface of Mars awaiting a mission that could return them. Nasa's plans for such an endeavour hang in the balance because of the threatened budget cuts, but China is also pursuing a sample return mission that could launch in 2028. While the decision is debated, scientists are desperate to get their gloved hands on the rocks. ""We need to see these samples back on Earth,"" said Prof Gupta. ""I think for true confidence, most scientists would want to see and examine these rocks on Earth - this is one of our high priority samples to return.""",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cd725pj0g9ro,Science,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/76f6/live/29389990-8da9-11f0-a306-c7044329a9c6.jpg,2025-09-10T15:00:16.706000+00:00,5e94a5baed2f1f3020c2d3bbe0576f0ae1ac5205

The Terra Nova carried Captain Scott and his men on their doomed expedition to reach the South Pole more than a century ago. The British party lost the race to the pole, and died on their return journey in 1912. The footage shows the Terra Nova colonised with sea life, but key features of the wooden ship are still visible including its wheel, winch and mast. Getty Images/Royal Geographical Society The Terra Nova is forever entwined in the tragic tale of Captain Scott and his men The wreck lies 170m down off the coast of Greenland. After the polar expedition with Scott, the ship continued in service and eventually sank in 1943 while carrying supplies to US bases during World War Two. The Terra Nova was discovered in 2012 by the Schmidt Ocean Institute, but the new expedition has been the first opportunity to record extensive footage of the wreck. ""To be able to see these significant parts of the wreck, it was truly awe inspiring,"" said Leighton Rolley, Science Systems Manager at REV Ocean. ""The wheel was sat there perfectly intact amongst the debris of the aft section of the wreck. ""When you think of the people who have stood there, manoeuvred the Terra Nova through ice, like Captain Scott… It was like, wow, if that ship's wheel could talk, it could tell an amazing history."" The Terra Nova was one of the finest polar vessels of its time and sailed for 60 years. The ship was 57m (187ft) long with a wooden hull that was a metre thick in places to help it break through the sea ice. Captain Scott's men embarked to Antarctica in 1910. A comprehensive scientific programme was planned for the Terra Nova expedition - along with the goal of being the first to reach the South Pole. Scott, along with Edward Wilson, Henry Bowers, Lawrence Oates and Edgar Evans, were attempting to make history. After trekking hundreds of miles, the British party reached the pole in January 1912, but they found they had been beaten by a Norwegian team led by Roald Amundsen. Getty Images Captain Scott and his men reached the pole but realised others had got there first A black flag, planted by Amundsen, is now on display at the Scott Polar Research Institute (SPRI) in Cambridge along with other items from the Terra Nova. ""Their hearts must have sunk seeing this black flag against the whiteness of Antarctica,"" said David Waterhouse, curator of the polar museum at SPRI. The deflated British party began their arduous return journey to their base.  But they encountered unusually bad weather, and Edgar Evans died after falling while descending a glacier. Several weeks later Captain Oates left the men's tent. His last words were recorded in Scott's journal: ""I'm just going outside and may be some time."" He was never seen again. Scott, Bowers and Wilson continued on and made a final camp, but trapped by a freezing blizzard with dwindling supplies, all three perished. A search expedition discovered their last camp just 11 miles from a resupply depot that would have provided them with food and fuel. Getty Images The Terra Nova played a crucial role in breaking the news of their death. ""In January 1913, the Terra Nova arrived at Cape Evans in the Antarctic to pick up the shore party, and they were expecting to pick up Captain Scott and his pole party at the same time,"" explained Naomi Boneham, an archivist at SPRI. ""But when they arrived they found out the sad news."" The ship's log records that the men had died from ""exposure and want"". The vessel sailed on to New Zealand, where the tragic end of the Terra Nova expedition was announced to the world. Getty Images/SPRI The Terra Nova (pictured in the background) continued in service after the polar expedition finished The new footage from the deep provides another chance to retell Scott's story, says David Waterhouse. ""It's a story that's really got the whole package - the heroism, the tragedy,"" he said. ""And, I guess, as British people, we like an underdog, and they were so close to being the first to the pole and making it back alive."" The ship that witnessed so much history now has a very different existence lying beneath the waves at the other end of the planet. It's not in good condition. While the centre of the ship is relatively intact, there is a lot of damage at the stern and the bow has split into two. But it's become a reef of life, says Leighton Rolley. ""It's full of fish, it's got corals growing on it - it's become one with the ocean.""",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cpwyvyqkx9yo,Science,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/3d5a/live/7f161480-790b-11f0-a0a3-2909e79b7d59.jpg,2025-09-02T23:21:27.812000+00:00,b6624250fc670893b94fd193d62fafecc81f6016
04826df30b0c,Oceangate's Titan whistleblower: 'People were sold a lie',,"Oceangate's Titan whistleblower: 'People were sold a lie' Rebecca Morelle Science Editor and Alison Francis Senior Science Journalist David Lochridge David Lochridge was sacked after raising safety concerns When the Titan submersible went missing during a dive to the wreck of the Titanic in 2023, David Lochridge hoped the five people on board – including his former boss - could be rescued. ""I always hoped that what happened wouldn't happen. But I just knew if they kept carrying on the way they were going and with that deficient equipment, then there would be an incident,"" he told the BBC. The whistleblower had been sacked by the firm behind the sub, Oceangate, after warning about safety issues in 2018. In June 2023 the sub imploded killing all five people on board – including Oceangate CEO Stockton Rush. A report from the US Coast Guard (USCG) published on Tuesday found that Oceangate's failures over safety, testing and maintenance were the main cause of the disaster. ""There is so much that could have been done differently. From the initial design, to the build, to the operations - people were sold a lie,"" Lochridge told the BBC. But he firmly believes the US authorities could - and should - have done more to stop Oceangate. PA Media The design and construction of Titan's hull was criticised in the report Lochridge had joined Oceangate seven years earlier as the company's Director of Marine Operations. He moved his family from Scotland to the US, and was full of excitement about the company's ambitions. Oceangate was building a new submersible to take paying passengers down to the most famous wreck in the world - the Titanic. And he was going to be involved in the project from the very start, working alongside the team designing the sub. The straight-talking Glaswegian has worked at sea for more than 25 years, first with the Royal Navy and later as a submersible pilot. He also led submarine rescue operations, responding to distress calls from people trapped underwater. He knows about the risks involved in deep dives. His responsibilities included planning dives and, as chief pilot, he would be the one taking the sub and its passengers 3,800m beneath the waves to see the Titanic. Safety was at the heart of his role. ""As the director of marine operations, I'm the one responsible for everybody,"" he told BBC News. ""I was responsible for the safety of all Oceangate personnel and all of the passengers that were going to be coming in the sub."" Supplied via Reuters / AFP Clockwise from top left: Stockton Rush, Hamish Harding, Shahzada Dawood and his son Suleman, and Paul-Henri Nargeolet were all killed in the accident A prototype for the new submersible, which would eventually be called Titan, was being developed with the University of Washington Applied Physics Laboratory (APL). The plan was to build its hull - the part where the passengers would sit - out of carbon fibre. No deep diving sub had been made out of this material before - most have hulls constructed from titanium or steel. But Lochridge had confidence in the APL team. He said he was told by Oceangate's CEO Stockton Rush that the craft would undergo a safety assessment by an independent marine organisation, known as certification. Lochridge was adamant that this third-party oversight was essential - especially because Titan was to be made of experimental materials. But by the summer of 2016 he was starting to have doubts about the project. Oceangate stopped working with APL and decided to bring the design and construction of Titan in-house. Lochridge was worried. He didn't have the same confidence in Oceangate's engineers. He told the BBC he didn't think they had experience of building subs able to withstand the immense pressures found at the depth of the Titanic. ""At that point, I started asking questions… and I felt I had a duty of care to keep asking them,"" he said. As the parts for Titan began to arrive, and the craft started to take shape, Lochridge said he was spotting problem after problem. ""When the carbon hull came in, it was an absolute mess,"" he said. He saw visible gaps in the material, areas where the layers of carbon fibre were coming apart - known as delamination. And he identified issues with other key components. David Lochridge David Lochridge had years of experience at sea The carbon fibre hull had titanium domes fitted on each end, but he said the metal had been machined incorrectly. He was also worried that the sub's view port had not been designed to work at extreme depths. Most concerning, he learnt that Titan was not going to be independently certified for safety. He told the BBC that he had always been outspoken on safety issues - so he wasn't going to stay silent. ""I brought up all the issues that I was seeing… but I was just met with resistance all the way,"" he said. In January 2018, he outlined his concerns again to Stockton Rush. This time Rush asked him to complete an inspection of the vessel. Titan was at a crucial point of its development. Passengers had already paid deposits for dives to the Titanic planned for later that year. Test dives were about to start in the Bahamas before those expeditions got underway. Lochridge wanted Oceangate to delay these plans. ""I formulated a report and I sent it out to all the directors in the company."" The following day he was summoned to a meeting with Rush and several other Oceangate employees. A transcript from the two-hour-long meeting, where the itemised report was picked over, reveals a heated exchange between Lochridge and Rush. Towards the end of the meeting, in response to Lochridge's safety concerns, Rush says: ""I have no desire to die. I've got a nice granddaughter. I'm going to be around. I understand this kind of risk, and I'm going into it with eyes open, and I think this is one of the safest things I will ever do."" To Lochridge's surprise, immediately after this meeting he was fired. But he was so concerned about Titan that he got in touch with the US government's Occupational Safety and Health Administration - OSHA. OSHA told him his case was urgent because it involved public safety and that he would be placed under the whistleblower protection scheme, designed to protect employees from retaliation by employers if they've reported concerns about workplace safety. As part of this process, OSHA passed Lochridge's concerns about Titan to the US Coast Guard (USCG) in February 2018. But Lochridge says after OSHA wrote to Oceangate to tell them it was starting an investigation, everything changed. In March, Oceangate asked Lochridge to drop the OSHA complaint - and demanded he pay $10,000 for legal costs. Lochridge declined. Then in July 2018, Oceangate sued Lochridge - and his wife Carole - for breach of contract, misappropriation of trade secrets, fraud and theft, amongst other allegations. The following month, Lochridge countersued for unfair dismissal. Lochridge maintains that throughout the process OSHA was slow and failed to protect him from the ongoing retaliation he was receiving from Oceangate. ""I provided all the documentation to OSHA, I was on the phone to OSHA every few weeks."" he said. ""OSHA did nothing."" 'They beat us down' In December 2018, under increasing pressure from Oceangate's lawyers, Lochridge and his wife took the decision to drop the case. This meant the legal proceedings were settled, and as part of this agreement Lochridge withdrew his complaint at OSHA. OSHA stopped its investigation and also notified the US Coast guard that the complaint had been suspended. Lochridge also signed a non-disclosure agreement. ""Carole and I did everything we physically could, we just got to the point that we were completely burned… We had nothing left to give to it. They beat us down."" Oceangate continued at pace with its plans to reach the Titanic. In 2018 and 2019, the prototype sub made its first test dives in the Bahamas - including one, piloted by Stockton Rush, that reached a depth of 3,939m. A crack was later found in the sub's carbon fibre hull, and in 2020 that damaged hull was swapped out for a new one, in what became the second version of Titan. In 2021, the company started taking passengers to the Titanic, and over the next two summers made 13 dives to the famous wreck. But in June 2023, the sub went missing with five people on board - including Stockton Rush. After days of anxious waiting, the sub's wreckage was found littered across the ocean floor. At the US Coast Guard's public hearings held last year, Lochridge criticised OSHA for its lack of action. ""I believe that if OSHA had attempted to investigate the seriousness of the concerns I raised on multiple occasions, this tragedy may have been prevented."" ""It didn't need to happen. It didn't - and it should have been stopped."" In response to Mr Lochridge, a spokesperson for OSHA said its whistleblower protection programme was limited to protecting individuals against employer retaliation. They said their investigation had ""followed the normal process and timeline for a retaliation case"". OSHA said it does not investigate whistleblowers' underlying allegations about public safety… but instead refers those to the appropriate agency - in this case, the US Coast Guard. The spokesperson said: ""The Coast Guard, not OSHA, had jurisdiction to investigate Mr. Lochridge's allegations regarding the safe design and construction of marine vessels."" But the US Coast Guard's report into the disaster agrees with Lochridge and says that OSHA's slow handling of the investigation was a missed opportunity for early government intervention. The report also criticises a lack of effective communication and coordination between OSHA and the USCG. The investigation found that the email from OSHA to the coast guard about Mr Lochridge's complaint was not received. It had been sent to a staff member who had responsibility for monitoring OSHA cases – but the employee had moved on to a new job within the agency. Jason Neubauer,  the chair of the USCG's Marine Board of Investigation, told the BBC that the coast guard could have done more. ""The system did not work for the whistleblower in this case, and that's why we just need to get better - and we have.""

1219b93faeb5,Kew Gardens' Palm House will close for five years for major makeover,,"Kew Gardens' Palm House will close for five years for major makeover Rebecca Morelle Science Editor and Alison Francis Senior Science Journalist Watch: BBC goes behind the scenes at Kew Gardens ahead of major Palm House renovation It's a makeover on a massive scale - it involves moving 1,300 plants, replacing 16,000 panes of glass and cleaning up hundreds of tonnes of iron. This is the ambitious £50m plan to renovate the world-famous Palm House, which sits at the heart of the Royal Botanic Gardens Kew. The hot and humid conditions inside have taken their toll on the building, which opened in 1848 and houses a tropical rainforest. Kew will also use the refurbishment – which will see the glass house closed for five years from 2027 – to reduce emissions from the Palm House to net zero. Kevin Church/BBC News Kew's oldest pot plant will be one of the trickier specimens to relocate The planning permission for the project has now been submitted, and some of the plants that make up the indoor tropical rainforest have started to be relocated. ""This is probably the plant that I worry about moving the most,"" says Thomas Pickering, head of glasshouses. He's standing next to one of Kew's most precious specimens: a plant called Encephalartos altensteinii , which is a type of cycad. It's growing in a pot, and at 250 years old, it's older than the Palm House itself. It's also enormous - weighing more than a tonne and standing about 4m tall. ""It's the sheer size of it. It has a huge weight in that root ball, but also this incredibly long stem, which is very old because they're incredibly slow-growing plants,"" says Pickering. The horticulturists will use scaffolds, supports and braces to protect the plant when the time comes for it to be moved. Other plants, that are a bit easier to shift, have already been taken to a temporary greenhouse. Kevin Church/BBC News The Palm House is packed with plants from all over the world ""It's going to be a long term project,"" explains Pickering. ""And over the next two years, it's going to be a process of selecting which plants we need to containerize (place in pots) and keep, which ones we need to propagate - and also some of the plants will be felled because we won't be able to move them."" RBG Kew The Palm House under construction in the 1840s RBG Kew This is what its interior looked like when it was being built RBG Kew It was completed in 1848 and was an engineering marvel of its time The Palm House was built more than 175 years ago and was a wonder of the Victorian age. No-one had ever constructed a glass house on that scale before and the engineers borrowed techniques from the shipping industry to build the huge structure. It was last renovated in the 1980s, but now the iron is heavily rusting in places, so it will be stripped back to the bare metal work, repaired and repainted. All of the thousands of single glazed panes of glass will be replaced and tests are under way to find the best type of glass to provide maximum insulation. Kevin Church/BBC News Techniques were borrowed from the shipping industry to build the huge structure Kevin Church/BBC News The heat and humidity that help the plants to thrive have damaged it Maintaining the Palm House's temperature at 21C uses a lot of energy,  but now gas boilers will be replaced with air source and water source heat pumps. ""This is an incredibly challenging building to make net zero,"" said Rachel Purdon, head of sustainability at Kew. ""We can do a huge amount with things like sealing the glass and improving the heating systems to massively reduce the carbon footprint and improve the sustainability of the Palm House without impacting the aesthetics."" The Water Lily House, which is located next to the Palm House, will also be made over as part of the renovation. The public will still be able to visit both for the next two years before they're closed for the works. RBG Kew The renovation will begin in 2027 and will take an estimated five years The team at Kew acknowledges this will be a big undertaking that will have a temporary impact on people coming to their botanic gardens. But they say the results will be worth it. ""The really important aspect of this is to try and ensure that the structure can last as long as possible, before we have to do another refurbishment,"" says Rachel Purdon.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cpwq08rxxklo,Science,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/ffce/live/eca2eaa0-61ff-11f0-b5c5-012c5796682d.jpg,2025-07-15T23:01:44.498000+00:00,10d1a0177d0af61f34e742ad7391537a06315b7d
82550e7d7a8c,Melting glaciers threaten to wipe out European villages - is the steep cost to protect them worth it?,,"Melting glaciers threaten to wipe out European villages - is the steep cost to protect them worth it? Imogen Foulkes Geneva correspondent BBC In a small village in Switzerland's beautiful Loetschental valley, Matthias Bellwald walks down the main street and is greeted every few steps by locals who smile or offer a handshake or friendly word. Mr Bellwald is a mayor, but this isn't his village. Two months ago his home, three miles away in Blatten, was wiped off the map when part of the mountain and glacier collapsed into the valley. The village's 300 residents had been evacuated days earlier, after geologists warned that the mountain was increasingly unstable. But they lost their homes, their church, their hotels and their farms. Lukas Kalbermatten also lost the hotel that had been in his family for three generations.""The feeling of the village, all the small alleys through the houses, the church, the memories you had when you played there as a child… all this is gone."" Hotel Edelweiss Blatten's residents were evacuated days before the disaster Today, he is living in borrowed accommodation in the village of Wiler. Mr Bellwald has a temporary office there too, where he is supervising the massive clean-up operation - and the rebuild. The good news is, he believes the site can be cleared by 2028, with the first new houses ready by 2029. But it comes with a hefty pricetag. Rebuilding Blatten is estimated to cost hundreds of millions of dollars, perhaps as much as $1 million (USD) per resident. Voluntary contributions from the public quickly raised millions of Swiss francs to help those who had lost their homes. The federal government and the canton promised financial support too. But some in Switzerland are asking: is it worth it? Shutterstock Houses were destroyed after a large part of Blatten was buried under masses of ice, mud, and rock Though the disaster shocked Switzerland, some two thirds of the country is mountainous, and climate scientists warn that the glaciers and the permafrost – the glue that holds the mountains together – are thawing as the global temperature increases, making landslides more likely. Protecting areas will be costly. Switzerland spends almost $500m a year on protective structures, but a report carried out in 2007 for the Swiss parliament suggested real protection against natural hazards could cost six times that. Is that a worthwhile investment? Or should the country - and residents - really consider the painful option of abandoning some of their villages? The day the earth shook The Alps are an integral part of Swiss identity. Each valley, like the Loetschental, has its own culture. Mr Kalbermatten used to take pride in showing hotel guests the ancient wooden houses in Blatten. Sometimes he taught them a few words of Leetschär, the local dialect. Losing Blatten, and the prospect of losing others like it, has made many Swiss ask themselves how many of those alpine traditions could disappear. Angus MacKenzie 'I'll never forget it. The earth shook.' Fernando Lehner recalls the day of the landslide Today, Blatten lies under millions of cubic metres of rock, mud, and ice. Above it, the mountain remains unstable. When they were first evacuated, Blatten's residents, knowing their houses had stood there for centuries, believed it was a purely precautionary measure. They would be home again soon, they thought. Fernando Lehner, a retired businessman, says no one expected the scale of the disaster. ""We knew there would be a landslide that day… But it was just unbelievable. I would never have imagined that it would come down so quickly. ""And that explosion, when the glacier and landslide came down into the valley, I'll never forget it. The earth shook."" Landslides are 'more unpredictable' The people of Blatten, keen to get their homes back as soon as possible, don't want to talk about climate change. They point out that the Alps are always dangerous, and describe the disaster as a once in a millennium event. But climate scientists say global warming is making alpine life more risky. Matthias Huss, a glaciologist with Zurich's Federal Institute of Technology, as well as glacier monitoring group Glamos, argues that climate change was a factor in the Blatten disaster. ""The thawing of permafrost at very high elevation led to the collapse of the summit,"" he explains. Matthias Huss Glaciologist Matthias Huss argues that climate change was a factor in the Blatten disaster ""This mountain summit crashed down onto the glacier… and also the glacier retreat led to the fact that the glacier stabilised the mountain less efficiently than before. So climate change was involved at every angle."" Geological changes unrelated to climate change also played a role, he concedes - but he points out that glaciers and permafrost are key stabilising factors across the alps. His team at Glamos has monitored a record shrinkage of the glaciers over the past few years. And average alpine temperatures are increasing. In the days before the mountain crashed down, Switzerland's zero-degree threshold – the altitude at which the temperature reaches freezing point – rose above 5,000 metres, higher than any mountain in the country. ""It is not the very first time that we're seeing big landslides in the Alps,"" says Mr Huss. ""I think what should be worrying us is that these events are becoming more frequent, but also more unpredictable."" Angus MacKenzie Blatten's residents lost their homes, church and farms: living below a mountain, as many Swiss do, looks increasingly precarious A study from November 2024 by the Swiss Federal Research Institute, which reviewed three decades of literature, concurred that climate change was ""rapidly altering high mountain environments, including changing the frequency, dynamic behavior, location, and magnitude of alpine mass movements"", although quantifying the exact impact of climate change was ""difficult"". More villages, more evacuations Graubünden is the largest holiday region in Switzerland, and is popular with skiers and hikers for its untouched nature, alpine views and pretty villages. The Winter Olympics was hosted here twice - in the upmarket resort of St Moritz - while the town of Davos hosts world leaders for the World Economic Forum each year. One village in Graubünden has a different story to tell. Brienz was evacuated more than two years ago because of signs of dangerous instability in the mountain above. Its residents have still not been able to return, and in July heavy rain across Switzerland led geologists to warn a landslide appeared imminent. Angus MacKenzie Average alpine temperatures are increasing, say scientists. Meanwhile glaciers are shrinking Elsewhere in Switzerland, above the resort of Kandersteg, in the Bernese Oberland region, a rockface has become unstable, threatening the village. Now residents have an evacuation plan. There too, heavy rain this summer raised the alarm, and some hiking trails up to Oeschinen Lake, a popular tourist attraction, were closed. Some disasters have claimed lives. In 2017, a massive rockslide came down close to the village of Bondo, killing eight hikers. Bondo has since been rebuilt, and refortified, at a cost of $64 million. As far back as 2003, the village of Pontresina spent millions on a protective dam to shore up the thawing permafrost in the mountain above. Not every alpine village is at risk, but the apparent unpredictability is causing huge concern. The debate around relocation Blatten, like all Swiss mountain villages, was risk mapped and monitored; that's why its 300 residents were evacuated. Now, questions are being asked about the future of other villages too. In the aftermath of the disaster, there was a huge outpouring of sympathy. But the possible price tag of rebuilding it also came with doubts. An editorial in the influential Neue Zürcher Zeitung questioned Switzerland's traditional - and constitutional - wealth distribution model, which takes tax revenue from urban centres like Zurich to support remote mountain communities. The article described Swiss politicians as being ""caught in an empathy trap"", adding that ""because such incidents are becoming more frequent due to climate change, they are shaking people's willingness to pay for the myth of the Alps, which shapes the nation's identity."" It suggested people living in risky areas of the Alps should consider relocation. Preserving the alpine villages is expensive. And Neue Zürcher Zeitung was not the first to question the cost of saving every alpine community, but its tone angered some. While three quarters of Swiss live in urban areas, many have strong family connections to the mountains. Switzerland may be a wealthy, highly developed, high-tech country now, but its history is rural, marked by poverty and harsh living conditions. Famine in the 19th century caused waves of emigration. Mr Kalbermatten explains that the word ""heimat"" is hugely important in Switzerland. ""Heimat is when you close your eyes and you think about what you did as a child, the place you lived as a child. ""It's a much bigger word than home."" Ask a Swiss person living for decades in Zurich or Geneva, or even New York, where their heimat is, and for many, the answer will be the village they were born in. For Mr Kalbermatten and his sister and brothers, who live in cities, heimat is the valley where people speak Leetschär, the dialect they all still dream in. Imogen Foulkes Traditional wooden masks called Tschäggättä are unique to that valley The fear is that if these valleys become depopulated, other aspects of unique mountain culture could be lost too - like the Tschäggättä, traditional wooden masks, unique to the Loetschental valley. Their origins are mysterious, possibly pagan. Every February, local young men wear them, along with animal skins, and run through the streets. Mr Kalbermatten points to the example of some areas of northern Italy where this loss of culture has happened. ""[Now] there are only abandoned villages, empty houses, and wolves. ""Do we want that?"" Angus MacKenzie Lukas Kalbermatten believes the site can be cleared by 2028, with Blatten's first new houses ready by 2029. For many, the answer is no: An opinion poll from research institute, Sotomo, asked 2,790 people what they most cherished about their country. The most common answer? Our beautiful alpine landscape, and our stability. But the poll did not ask what price they were prepared to pay. Trying to tame a mountain Boris Previsic, the director of the University of Lucerne's Institute for the Culture of the Alps, says that many Swiss, at least in the cities, had begun to believe they had tamed the alpine environment. Switzerland's railways, tunnels, cable cars and high alpine passes are masterpieces of engineering, connecting alpine communities. But now, in part because of climate change, he suggests, that confidence is gone. ""The human induced geology is too strong compared to human beings,"" he argues. ""In Switzerland, we thought we could do everything with infrastructure. Now I think we are at ground zero concerning infrastructure."" Boris Previsic Boris Previsic says that many Swiss, at least in the cities, had begun to believe they had tamed the alpine environment The village of Blatten had stood for centuries. ""When you are in a village which has existed already for 800 years, you should feel safe. That is what is so shocking."" In his view, it is time to fight against these villages dying out. ""To fight means we have to be more prepared,"" he explains. ""But we have to be more flexible. We have always also to consider evacuation."" At the end of the day, he adds, ""you cannot hold back the whole mountain"". In the village of Wiler, Mr Previsic's point is greeted with a weary smile. ""The mountain always decides,"" agrees Mr Bellwald. ""We know that they are dangerous. We love the mountains, we don't hate them because of that. Our grandfathers lived with them. Our fathers lived with them. And our children will also live with them."" Angus MacKenzie Helicopters carry debris from the disaster site at Blatten. Even the military is involved in the operation. At lunchtime in the local restaurant in Wiler, the tables are filled with clean-up teams, engineers and helicopter crew. The Blatten recovery operation is in full swing. At one table, a man from one of Switzerland's biggest insurance companies sits alone. Every half hour, he is joined by someone, an elderly couple, a middle aged man, a young woman. He buys each a drink, and carefully notes down the details of their lost homes. Outside, along the valley's winding roads, lorries and bulldozers trundle up to the disaster site. Overhead, helicopters carry large chunks of debris. Even the military is involved. Sebastian Neuhaus commands the Swiss army's disaster relief readiness battalion, and says they must press on despite the scale of the task. ""We have to,"" he says. ""There are 300 life histories buried down there."" The abiding feeling is one of stubborn determination to carry on. ""If we see someone from Blatten, we hug each other,"" says Mr Kalbermatten. ""Sometimes we say, 'it's nice, you're still here.' And that's the most important thing, we are all still here."" Lead image: The village of Blatten after the disaster.

c57d453b9995,Why plane turbulence is becoming more frequent - and more severe,,"Why plane turbulence is becoming more frequent - and more severe Simon King Lead Weather Presenter BBC Listen to this article being read Andrew Davies was on his way to New Zealand to work on a Doctor Who exhibition, for which he was project manager. The first leg of his flight from London to Singapore was fairly smooth. Then suddenly the plane hit severe turbulence. ""Being on a rollercoaster is the only way I can describe it,"" he recalls. ""After being pushed into my seat really hard, we suddenly dropped. My iPad hit me in the head, coffee went all over me. There was devastation in the cabin with people and debris everywhere. ""People were crying and [there was] just disbelief about what had happened."" Mr Davies was, he says, ""one of the lucky ones"". Other passengers were left with gashes and broken bones. Geoff Kitchen, who was 73, died of a heart attack. Death as a consequence of turbulence is extremely rare. There are no official figures but there are estimated to have been roughly four deaths since 1981. Injuries, however, tell a different story. REUTERS/Stringer Severe turbulence on the Singapore Airlines flight caused the plane to drop 178ft (54m) in 4.6 seconds In the US alone, there have been 207 severe injuries - where an individual has been admitted to hospital for more than 48 hours - since 2009, official figures from the National Transportation Safety Board show. (Of these, 166 were crew and may not have been seated.) But as climate change shifts atmospheric conditions, experts warn that air travel could become bumpier: temperature changes and shifting wind patterns in the upper atmosphere are expected to increase the frequency and intensity of severe turbulence. ""We can expect a doubling or tripling in the amount of severe turbulence around the world in the next few decades,"" says Professor Paul Williams, an atmospheric scientist at the University of Reading. ""For every 10 minutes of severe turbulence experienced now, that could increase to 20 or 30 minutes."" So, if turbulence does get more intense, could it become more dangerous too - or are there clever ways that airlines can better ""turbulence-proof"" their planes? The bumpy North Atlantic route Severe turbulence is defined as when the up and down movements of a plane going through disturbed air exert more than 1.5g-force on your body - enough to lift you out of your seat if you weren't wearing a seatbelt. Estimates show that there are around 5,000 incidents of severe-or-greater turbulence every year, out of a total of more than 35 million flights that now take off globally. Of the severe injuries caused to passengers flying throughout 2023 - almost 40% were caused by turbulence, according to the annual safety report by the International Civil Aviation Organization. The route between the UK and the US, Canada and the Caribbean is among the areas known to have been affected. Over the past 40 years, since satellites began observing the atmosphere, there has been a 55% increase in severe turbulence over the North Atlantic. But the frequency of turbulence is projected to increase in other areas too according to a recent study - among them, parts of East Asia, North Africa, North Pacific, North America and the Middle East. The knock-on effect of climate change There are three main causes of turbulence: convective (clouds or thunderstorms), orographic (air flow around mountainous areas) and clear-air (changes in wind direction or speed). Each type could bring severe turbulence. Convective and orographic are often more avoidable - it is the clear-air turbulence that, as the name might imply, cannot be seen. Sometimes it seemingly comes out of nowhere. KIRILL KUDRYAVTSEV /AFP via Getty Avoiding turbulence-producing storms can crowd airspace, as more planes are forced to change routes, according to experts Climate change is a major factor in driving up both convective and clear-air turbulence. While the relationship between climate change and thunderstorms is complex, a warmer atmosphere can hold more moisture - and that extra heat and moisture combine to make more intense thunderstorms. Linking this back to turbulence — convective turbulence is created by the physical process of air rising and falling in the atmosphere, specifically within clouds. And you won't find more violent up and downdrafts than in cumulonimbus, or thunderstorm clouds. This was the cause of the severe turbulence on Andrew Davies's journey back in 2024. A report by Singapore's Transport Safety Investigation Bureau found that the plane was ""likely flying over an area of developing convective activity"" over south Myanmar, leading to ""19 seconds of extreme turbulence that included a drop of 178 feet in just under five seconds"". MediaNews Group/Boston Herald via Getty Images A 2014 US study found that for every 1°C rise in global temperature, lightning strikes increase by 12% One study from the US published in the Science journal in 2014 showed that for 1C increase in global temperature, lightning strikes increase by 12%. Captain Nathan Davies, a commercial airline pilot, says: ""I have noticed more large storm cells spreading 80 miles plus in diameter in the last few years, something you'd expect to be rare."" But he adds: ""The large cumulonimbus clouds are easy to spot visually unless embedded within other clouds, so we can go around them."" Clear-air turbulence could also soon rise. It is caused by disturbed air in and around the jet stream, (a fast-moving wind at around six miles in the atmosphere, which is the same height as where planes cruise). Wind speeds in the jet stream travelling from west to east across the Atlantic can vary from 160mph to 250mph. There is colder air to the north and warmer air to the south: this temperature difference and change in winds is useful for airliners to use as a tailwind to save time and fuel. But it also creates the turbulent air. ""Climate change is warming the air to the south of the jet stream more than the air to the north so that temperature difference is being made stronger,"" explains Prof Williams. ""Which in turn is driving a stronger jet stream."" 'It should worry us all' The increase in severe turbulence - enough to lift you out of your seat - could potentially bring more incidents of injury, or possibly death in the most severe cases. And some passengers are concerned. For Mr Davies, the prospect of more turbulence is worrying. ""A lot. Not just for me, but my children too,"" he explains. ""I'm pleased there hasn't been an incident as severe as mine but I think it should worry us all"". More than a fifth of UK adults say they are scared of flying, according to a recent YouGov survey, and worsening turbulence could make journeys even more of a nightmare for these people. As Wendy Barker, a nervous flyer from Norfolk, told me: ""More turbulence to me equals more chance of something going wrong and less chance of survival."" Aircraft wings are, however, designed to fly through turbulent air. As Chris Keane, a former pilot and now ground-school instructor says, ""you won't believe how flexible a wing is. In a 747 passenger aircraft, under 'destructive' testing, the wings are bent upwards by some 25 degrees before they snap, which is really extreme and something that will never happen, even in the most severe turbulence."" For airlines, however, there is a hidden concern: that is the economic costs of more turbulence. The hidden cost of turbulence AVTECH, a tech company that monitors climate and temperature changes - and works with the Met Office to help warn pilots of turbulence - suggests that the costs can range from £180,000 to £1.5 million per airline annually. This includes the costs of having to check and maintain aircraft after severe turbulence, compensation costs if a flight has to be diverted or delayed, and costs associated with being in the wrong location. Kevin Carter/GETTY Climate change is one factor in making turbulence worse, increasing both storm-related and clear-air turbulence Eurocontrol, a civil-military organisation that helps European aviation understand climate change risks, says that diverting around turbulence-producing storms can have a wider impact - for example, if lots of aircraft are having to change flight paths, airspace can get more crowded in certain areas. ""[This] increases workload for pilots and air traffic controllers considerably,"" says a Eurocontrol spokesperson. Having to fly around storms also means extra fuel and time. In 2019 for example, Eurocontrol says bad weather ""forced airlines to fly one million extra kilometres, producing 19,000 extra tonnes of CO2."" With extreme weather predicted to increase, they expect flights will need to divert around bad weather such as storms and turbulence even more by 2050. ""Further driving up the costs to airlines, passengers and [increasing] their carbon footprint."" How airlines are turbulence-proofing Forecasting turbulence has got better in recent years and while it is not perfect, Prof Williams suggests we can correctly forecast about 75% of clear-air turbulence. ""Twenty years ago it was more like 60% so thanks to better research that figure is going up and up over time,"" he says. Aircraft have weather radar that will pick up storms ahead. As Capt Davies explains, ""Before a flight, most airlines will produce a flight plan that details areas of turbulence likely throughout the route, based on computer modelling."" It is not 100% accurate, but ""it gives a very good idea combined with other aircraft and Air Traffic Control reports once we are en-route"". RUNGROJ YONGRIT/EPA - EFE/REX/Shutterstock An Austrian start-up, Turbulence Solutions, says it has developed turbulence-cancelling tech for light aircraft Southwest Airlines in the US recently decided to end cabin service earlier, at 18,000ft instead of the previous 10,000ft. By having the crew and passengers seated with belts on ready for landing at this altitude, Southwest Airlines suggests it will cut turbulence-related injuries by 20%. Also last year, Korean Airlines decided to stop serving noodles to its economy passengers as it had reported a doubling of turbulence since 2019, which raised the risk of passengers getting burned. From owls to AI: extreme measures Some studies have taken turbulence-proofing even further, and looked at alternative ways to build wings. Veterinarians and engineers have studied how a barn owl flies so smoothly in gusty winds, and discovered wings act like a suspension and stabilise the head and torso when flying through disturbed air. The study published in the Royal Society proceedings in 2020 concluded that ""a suitably tuned, hinged-wing design could also be useful in small-scale aircraft…helping reject gusts and turbulence"". Separately, a start-up in Austria called Turbulence Solutions claims to have created turbulence cancelling technology for light aircraft, where a sensor detects turbulent air and sends a signal to a flap on the wing which counteracts that turbulence. These can reduce moderate turbulence by 80% in light aircraft, according to the company's CEO. NurPhoto via Getty Turbulence forecasting has improved in recent years, helping pilots avoid bumpy areas Then there are those arguing that AI could be a solution. Fourier Adaptive Learning and Control (FALCON) is a type of technology being researched at the California Institute of Technology that learns how turbulent air flows across a wing in real-time. It also anticipates the turbulence, giving commands to a flap on the wing which then adjusts to counteract it. However Finlay Asher, an aerospace engineer and member of Safe Landing, a community of aviation workers calling for a more sustainable future in aviation, explained that these types of technology are some time away. ""[They're] unlikely to appear on large commercial aircraft within the next couple of decades."" But even if turbulence does become more frequent, and more severe, experts argue this isn't cause for worry. ""It's generally nothing more than annoying,"" says Captain Davies. But it might mean more time sitting down, with the seat-belt fastened. Andrew Davies has already learnt this the hard way: ""I do get a lot more nervous and don't look forward to flying like I used to,"" he admits. ""But I won't let it define me. ""The moment I sit down, my seat belt goes on and if I do need to get up, I pick my moment - then I'm quickly back in my seat, buckled up again.""

4001cd116eb4,The fate of the Sycamore Gap tree has shed light on a deeper concern,,"The fate of the Sycamore Gap tree has shed light on a deeper concern Helen Briggs Environment correspondent BBC James Canton spent two years sitting beneath an 800-year-old oak tree near his home in Essex, watching acorns fatten and butterflies land on the massive knurled grey trunk. Sometimes he sat in the branches too. Canton, a lecturer at the University of Essex, recalls how it helped him feel a ""sense of connection"". ""We're happier sat in an oak tree ten foot from the ground, watching blue tits feeding on caterpillars – involved and immersed in that natural world."" He went on to write a book called The Oak Papers about that time spent studying the Honywood Oak. For years, it was easy to forget that we used to be a woodland nation: around 6,000 years ago untouched swathes of oak, hazel, birch and pine blanketed an estimated 75% of the UK. But in recent months the felling of the Sycamore Gap tree next to Hadrian's Wall in Northumberland has put our relationship with trees, and the natural world more widely, back under the spotlight. PA Media The Sycamore Gap tree stood in a natural dip along Hadrian's Wall in Northumberland for over a century before it was felled in 2023 Two men are due to be sentenced today for the crime that has been called a ""mindless destruction"". Canton calls it a ""symbolic"" moment. The felling of the Sycamore Gap has prompted calls for stricter legal protections for trees, not only to help prevent similar crimes in future but also to help the public appreciate the value of trees at a time when many of our woodlands are in poor health and targets for tree-planting are not being met. But even if the government were to back calls for greater legal protections, other questions remain - namely, which trees should be protected? And arguably even more pressingly: should Britain be thinking more broadly about how to save our depleting woodlands - and is legal protection enough or is a fundamental rethink required? UK's 'odd relationship' with trees The Sycamore Gap wasn't a particularly ancient tree, nor a native species, but its position gave it a totemic status. Tucked into a fold of the hills in an area of outstanding beauty, it was famous around the world. People went there to have picnics, propose marriage, scatter ashes and to seek solace during lockdown. Local people spoke of their devastation at its loss, while Northumberland National Park Authority received thousands of emails, letters and messages. Northumbria Police Daniel Graham and Adam Carruthers were both found guilty of two counts of criminal damage in connection with the felling of the Sycamore Gap tree And yet despite apparently being a nation of tree lovers, the UK is one of the most nature-depleted countries on Earth - it still isn’t planting enough trees, despite calls by successive governments. The UK has 13% woodland cover, compared to an average of 38% in Europe, according to Prof Mary Gagen of Swansea University. Despite woodland creation rates being much higher now than they were in the 2010s, they remain off track, according to statistics from Forest Research. The target set by the previous Conservative government was to plant 30,000 hectares a year by 2025 across the UK, in line with the heyday of tree planting in the 1970s. Statistics show that 20,700 hectares of new woodland was created in the UK between April 2023 and March 2024, a big achievement. However, this fell to 15,700 hectares over the year to March 2025, largely as a result of a drop-off in planting in Scotland. (Rates in England, Wales and Northern Ireland went up – though from a low base.) Mike Kemp via Getty Images Experts warn that the UK's native woodlands are in crisis, with only 7% currently in good ecological condition And the woodlands that already exist aren't in great shape. Only 7% of it is in good ecological health, says Prof Gagen. She is among those who think that this all nods to an ""odd relationship"" with trees – one of ""simultaneously adoring and denuding woodlands"". Andrew Allen of the Woodland Trust warns there could be a knock-on effect: ""While money goes into getting new trees in the ground, we continue to spend very little on looking after the trees we already have - and this risks serious consequences."" 'Why would a tree older than Stonehenge go unprotected?'' Ancient trees provide a home to hundreds of different bird, insect and mammal species, yet they have no automatic right of protection. This is unlike some other countries, including Italy and Poland, where so-called ""heritage"" trees have specific legal protections. Some UK trees are protected through being in a nature reserve or a site of special scientific interest, while Tree Preservation Orders can be made by a local planning authority to protect specific trees or woodland from deliberate damage or destruction. PA Media The Tree Council has published a report urging stronger protection for the country's most significant and irreplaceable trees, like the one at Sycamore Gap Yet many fall through the gaps. Only a fifth of our ""oldest and most important veteran trees"" are in protected areas, says Prof Gagen. Veteran trees are trees that through their own decay act as a habitat for other species, promoting biodiversity. The Tree Council charity has written a report calling for greater protections for the country's ""most important trees"", such as the one that stood at the Sycamore Gap. The outpouring of emotion and anger after the felling shows how valued these ""socially, culturally and environmentally important trees are"", says Jess Allan, science and research projects manager at the charity. On the back of a Heritage Trees Bill, introduced in December 2023 as a private members bill in the House of Lords, the charity is calling for legislation to create a statutory list of the most valuable trees and to impose stricter penalties for damaging them, mirroring the system for listed buildings. Crucially, this could protect trees that are much-loved and culturally important because of their place in the landscape, as well as protecting ancient trees that are vital in preserving nature. PA Media Backed by the proposed Heritage Trees Bill in the House of Lords, the Tree Council is calling for a legal register of the UK's most valuable trees, along with tougher penalties for damaging them Jon Stokes, the charity's director of trees, science and research, points out that in Portugal, the fine for destroying a notable tree can be as much as €500,000 (£433,000). He says protecting our ""most celebrated trees"" is a no-brainer. ""There are yew trees in this country that are older than Stonehenge – nobody would ever contemplate not protecting Stonehenge so why would a living thing that's older than Stonehenge not receive some protection?"" He hopes something positive could come out of the felling of the Sycamore Gap: it has made people realise that some of the UK's trees are ""truly vital to our culture and heritage and history – and our biodiversity - we should be looking after them better than we are at the moment"". The Tree Council's report is currently being assessed by the government, but there is no date on when any decision will be made. 'You can't stop reckless acts' There are some who believe legal reforms are not enough. After all, the proposed new measures might not have saved the famous sycamore: its felling involved trespass onto land owned by the Northumberland National Park. A Tree Preservation Order wouldn't have made a difference either, adds Sarah Dodd of Tree Law in Barry, Wales, a law firm that specialises in legal issues involving trees. ""Ultimately, you can put all the protection you want on trees, but some people are just going to break the law. You can't stop some people doing some reckless acts.” PA Media At the RHS Chelsea Flower Show, Dame Judi Dench was presented with a seedling from the Sycamore Gap tree The bigger question, she says, is how we get people to appreciate the value of trees and therefore not want to fell them. She hopes that giving trees special legal status will raise their profile, and make people recognise their importance. Mr Stokes, of the Tree Council, says that to maximise the biodiversity value of trees, it’s crucial to celebrate and protect the old ones. And to build up new trees next to older ones, so that wildlife can flow ""from these ancient bastions into the new woods and hedges and individual trees that we're planting"". A recent report by the Woodland Trust confirmed that the current health of woods and trees is ""concerning"". Proposed solutions include more woodland creation, better management, agroforestry (combining agriculture and trees), ancient woodland restoration, and natural flood management, whereby trees are planted to slow down water flow. But this will not be easy and Prof Gagen of Swansea University says saving the UK's woodlands is a complex problem that demands difficult choices. Difficult choices ahead ”Unfortunately, for most people if asked if they'd like more new, cheaper housing or faster transport, or to protect nature, they are going to sacrifice a woodland,"" says Prof Gagen. She argues there is a need to ensure people are aware of the ""true value of nature"". ""A single big tree in the right place is providing thousands of pounds worth of carbon store, flood protection, free air conditioning, habitat, wellbeing provision, pollution control and a hundred other benefits, and no one is asked to pay those costs if the tree is felled for development. “That needs to change to save UK woodlands."" As for Canton, he stills visits the Honywood Oak near his home, and is involved in projects to turn around the fortunes of the ""forgotten forests"", areas of ancient woodland that were historically turned into timber plantations and now need to be restored. He hopes that years from now we will have learned from the loss of the Sycamore Gap tree and others like it, and changed our attitude. ""I'd really like to think that in a generation's time, there will be rights for trees – trees that are over say 100 years old that you cannot do this, and you get much worse punishments than currently exist,"" he says. ""Hopefully in time we will gradually get there – our society is naturally catching up with our natural emotional connection with the natural world.""

323e4673cd37,This burger was made from cow cells in a lab. Should it really be served in restaurants?,,"This burger was made from cow cells in a lab. Should it really be served in restaurants? Pallab Ghosh Science correspondent BBC Inside an anonymous building in Oxford, Riley Jackson is frying a steak. The perfectly red fillet cut sizzles in the pan, its juices releasing a meaty aroma. But this is no ordinary steak. It was grown in the lab next door. What's strangest of all is just how real it looks. The texture, when cut, is indistinguishable from the real thing. ""That's our goal,"" says Ms Jackson of Ivy Farm Technologies, the food tech start-up that created it. ""We want it to be as close to a normal steak as possible."" Lab-grown meat is already sold in many parts of the world and in a couple of years, pending being granted regulatory approval, it could also be sold in the UK too - in burgers, pies and sausages. Unlike so-called vegetarian meat, which is already available in UK supermarkets -  from fake bacon rashers made from pea protein to steaks made of soy, and dyed bright red to resemble the real thing - lab-grown meat is biologically real meat, grown from cow cells. Ivy Farm Technologies The lab-grown steak from Ivy Farm Technologies has a texture indistinguishable from regular steak To some, this could be a smart technological fix for a growing environmental problem: the rise in planet-heating gases caused, in part, by the rapid and growing demand for meat. But others argue that the environmental benefits of lab-grown meat, officially known as cultivated meat, have been oversold. Some critics say that more effort should instead be expended on reducing meat consumption, instead of looking to a technology fix. Then there are questions around the ultra-processed nature of this meat, which some also worry will be produced by a handful of multinational companies. So now, with dog food made from meat that was grown in factory vats having already gone on sale in the UK earlier this year and with the possibility of lab-grown food for humans becoming available sooner than expected - the debate has never been more prescient. Nor has the question: to grow or not to grow? Curbing greenhouse gas emissions Global demand for meat is growing. According the UN's Food and Agriculture Organisation, meat production has increased fivefold since the 1960s and reached around 364 million tonnes in 2023. Producing 1kg of beef can generate planet-heating greenhouse gases, equivalent to roughly 40kg of carbon dioxide, though estimates can vary depending on the type of production. A study published in Nature Food in 2021 concluded that food production was responsible for a third of global greenhouse gas emissions. Cattle also burp planet-heating methane gas, plus they require water and land. Ivy Farm Technologies The BBC's Pallab Ghosh witnessed Ivy Farm's lab-grown steak being cooked but was unable to sample it as it is not yet approved Tim Lang, a professor of food policy at City St George's, University of London argues that the issue is a ticking environmental time bomb. ""The situation is absolutely dire,"" he says. ""Politicians are fearful of engaging with the issue. They don't want to take on the meat and farming industry, nor do they wish to risk unpopularity by enacting policies that would reduce meat consumption."" Lab-grown meat has been marketed as part of a solution. Its advocates claim that it can meet the growing demand for meat with much less carbon emissions and land use, plus it can help governments hit certain targets. In the UK, for example, a 2021 independent review for the Department for the Environment Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) has called for a 30% reduction in meat consumption by 2032 to meet the country's net zero target. Lab-grown sausages, eel and caviar The science behind lab-grown meat is also relatively straightforward. Researchers take cells from a farm animal and grow more of them in a dish. When they have enough, they are put into ever larger vats until they have enough to produce a meat product. Turning this into something that people want to eat is trickier. Each company has its own closely guarded secret sauce. But in the main, the cells are developed in a cocktail of nutrients, which encourage them to grow in the right way, after which other ingredients are sometimes added to boost the nutritional values. The result is a paste, which is then processed and mixed with other foods such as soy to make it look, feel and taste more like meat. There are also plans to produce fish-like products this way, including eel and even caviar. Good Meat, Inc. The laboratory at GOOD Meat - its cultivated chicken is approved for sale in Singapore and the United States Ivy Farm Technologies business that has applied for approval to sell its cultivated meat in the UK. If granted, its first products won't be steaks but burgers and sausages. It plans to combine cultivated mince, (which is cheaper and easier to produce than trying to replicate the taste of a real steak) with regular mince to create a blended cow-cultivated beef burger. ""If you want to make a sustainable difference, you have to go for mass production and burgers are where the masses are,"" says the firm's CEO Dr Harsh Amin. ""If you blend our cultivated meat with animal derived meat, you are [still] reducing the carbon footprint."" ""Hope not hard evidence""? Ivy Farm claims this type of meat can lead to significant reductions in greenhouse gas emissions and other environmental benefits. Other companies make similar claims, but these are based more on hope than hard evidence, according to Dr John Lynch, of Oxford University, who has carried out a comprehensive, independent assessment of the climate impact of lab-grown meat. ""There have not been any accurate climate assessment studies because production is not happening at large scale at the moment,"" he adds. The problem with comparing the climate impact of lab-grown meat with agricultural production is that there is little data and many variables. Growing cells in vats requires energy, as does producing the chemicals that are added. Businesses keep the details of their processes secret, for perfectly legitimate reasons, so it is hard to produce a single figure for the climate cost of cultivated meat. Farm Images via Getty Methane from cows disappears from the atmosphere after about 12 years but the CO2 used to produce lab-grown food may stay around for longer Dr Lynch has assessed the data available in scientific papers and found that the best-case cultivated meat carbon footprints were as low as 1.65 kg of CO2 per kg, which is better for the climate than traditional beef production. However, if a lab-grown meat process needs a lot of energy, some estimates put the figure as high as 22kg of CO2 per kg, making its climate advantage less certain. Then there is the fact that the cows' methane gas burps disappear from the atmosphere after 12 years or so, whereas the CO2 produced to grow the lab meat continues to do its damage for much longer. Dr John Lynch has taken the more damaging impact of methane into account in his calculations and they indicate that the persistance of CO2 in the atmosphere can do more damage in the long term. So, in the long run, it may be a bad idea to replace cows with high energy lab-grown production, according to Dr Lynch's assessment. Yet that may be counter-balanced by the fact that cultivated meat production would require far less land. The bottom line is that the environmental advantages of lab-grown beef over cattle farming is a closer run thing than its advocates argue - but it is likely to have the edge as production methods scale up and become more efficient, according to Dr Lynch. ""For beef, it is quite viable for cultured meat to come out on top,"" he argues. ""But I don't think it is the same story for chicken and pork, which convert their feed into meat more efficiently than cattle."" Lab-grown salmon in fine dining restaurants Singapore became the first country to allow the sale of cell-cultivated meat for human consumption in 2020. This was followed by the United States three years later and Israel in 2024. UK firms have complained that the regulatory approvals process is too slow for them to keep up with overseas competitors. But sales in those countries have in the main been peripatetic, with many firms only offering tastings or serving it in upmarket restaurants for short periods. Good Meat, Inc. Good Meat's lab-grown chicken was served at a restaurant in Washington, DC This is largely because manufacturers are not able to mass-produce their products in sufficient quantities or as cheaply as traditional meat. In the US, four companies have received some form of regulatory approval for their lab-grown chicken, pork fat and salmon. Salmon from Wildtype, for example, is now served at Kann, a fine-dining restaurant in Oregon, while Good Meat's chicken was introduced at a restaurant in Washington, DC. The response from consumers so far has been ""optimistic and curious"", according to Suzi Gerber who is the executive director of the US Association for Meat, Poultry and Seafood Innovation. What farmers and fishermen say Some parts of the US cattle industry have, however, expressed opposition to the technology and lobbied for it to be banned, though other livestock firms have remained neutral or been supportive. The National Cattlemen's Beef Association and several state-level organisations publicly oppose bans, perhaps in case it sets a precedent for banning other scientific advances, such as bio-engineered food stock for cattle. The cultivated meat industry says that their products should have no effect on the livestock industry – people will always prefer real meat over artificial. The role of the new technology is, they say, to meet the demand that livestock production is unable to. The seafood industry has also shown openness: for example, the US National Fisheries Institute recognises cultivated seafood as part of a broader domestic production of on-land fish, like aquaculture. Will ""high-protein slurry"" really save the planet? Ellen Dinsmoor is chief operating officer of Vow, a Sydney-based firm that sells cultivated Japanese quail products in Singapore. It recently received approval to sell in Australia too. Unlike some cultivated meat firms, Vow is not trying to copy normal meats. Instead, the firm has chosen quail because fewer people know what it is supposed to taste like. ""What we have to do is produce a really delicious product that people want,"" she explains. ""A little later we can sell it on nutrition, for example we can add healthy omega-3 oils found only in salmon into chicken. And then if we can do all that at a fraction of the price, this is where it becomes interesting to consumers."" This is all part of a strategy to create a stable high-end market, which could in time enable investment in producing food that is less posh and in larger quantities. But for some critics, the potential benefits of this technology for the environment, or indeed for the poorest communities in the world, are being lost. Vow Unlike other lab-grown meat companies, Vow isn't trying to copy traditional meats - its products include Vow Japanese Quail Foie Gras and Japanese Quail Whipped Pate Some of the start-up companies involved are driven by delivering swift returns to their investors, argues Dr Chris van Tulleken, author of Ultra-Processed People, which can be more easily done by producing high-priced products in high-income countries. A simpler, cheaper and easier option, he argues, would be to persuade people in both developed and emerging countries to eat less meat. ""It is all very well to propose to people that they should eat a high-protein slurry to keep themselves well,"" he argues, ""but… I don't think it is something we should impose on already marginalised groups of people."" He also worries that the emergence of cultivated food is an acceleration of a long-term trend away from environmentally sustainable, locally sourced, whole foods and toward factory mass-produced fare. ""And at the moment the process is pretty energy intensive."" But like it or not, lab-grown meat is here. To some, it's a healthier option with less cholesterol, no animal suffering - and a clever solution to a pressing environmental problem. To others, those benefits may have been overblown. For all the promises and potential about helping the world, however, most people choose food for more personal reasons, namely how it tastes and how affordable it is. That, more than anything, may well decide its future.

217450c7542d,William visibly moved as widow tells of husband's suicide,,"William visibly moved as widow tells of husband's suicide Sean Coughlan Royal correspondent Watch: Prince William was visibly moved as he heard first hand about the devastating impact of suicide, having to pause during a conversation The Prince of Wales was visibly moved as he heard first hand about the devastating impact of suicide, having to pause during a conversation with Rhian Mannings, whose husband took his own life. Rhian has since set up a bereavement charity - and Prince William's Royal Foundation is contributing £1m to develop a National Suicide Prevention Network. The network, which will operate across the UK, will work to understand more about the root causes of suicide and to offer support for those affected. Prince William, on World Mental Health Day, said he wanted to ""build a bold, unified national response to the heartbreaking and preventable tragedy of suicide"". KENSINGTON PALACE Prince William visited Rhian Mannings at her home in Cardiff In an emotional conversation, captured on camera, Rhian Mannings told the prince that her husband had taken his own life, five days after the couple had faced the death of their one-year-old son. The prince asked her how she had coped and continued to bring up two children. ""I look back and I still don't know how we survived it,"" said Rhian. ""Unfortunately, there's still a lot of stigma around suicide, did you feel that at the time?"" asked Prince William. ""I was quite surprised by it. I'd never been touched by suicide. It was something that happened on the news. No one would talk about it,"" he was told by Rhian, in a conversation in her kitchen in Cardiff. Prince William asked her what she would say to her husband. ""'Why didn't you speak to me?' I ask myself that every single day. He was absolutely devastated, he did keep blaming himself,"" she said. ""But I would just like to sit him down like this and say 'Why didn't you come to me?' Because he's missed out on just so much joy. And we would have been ok. I think that's the hardest thing, we would have been ok."" The prince seemed too upset to speak. ""Are you ok?"" she asked. ""I'm sorry, it's hard to ask you the questions,"" said William. ""You've experienced loss yourself,"" said Rhian. ""Life can throw you these awful curve balls. By talking about it, by having hope, you can continue."" After her own terrible loss, which happened in 2012, Rhian founded a charity, 2wish, to help those affected by the sudden or unexpected death of a child or young person. That charity will be one of 20 organisations that will form part of a new National Suicide Prevention Network, being launched with £1m over three years, from the Royal Foundation of the Prince and Princess of Wales. The network will be chaired by Professor Ann John, an expert in the prevention of suicide and consultant in public health medicine in Wales. The Royal Foundation says that preventing suicide is a ""complex challenge"" and there is no ""one size fits all model of support"". But the new network will try to understand more about the causes of suicide, to provide support that can be accessed by anyone and to encourage more collaboration between different agencies and charities. Reuters Prince William last month visited the Jac Lewis Foundation in Cardiff Among the charities in the network will be the Jac Lewis Foundation in Cardiff, which Prince William visited last month. It provides a drop-in centre, located inside Cardiff's Principality Stadium, which can provide mental health support to the local community. The charity's chief executive officer, Elizabeth Thomas-Evans, said: ""From the valleys to the cities, suicide has scarred communities across Wales."" But she hoped that people in need would now be able to walk in and get help. Another partner is James' Place, which offers free support to men in suicidal crisis in Liverpool, London and Newcastle. Chief executive Ellen O'Donoghue said she wanted to ""remove some of the barriers men face in accessing support at the point of crisis"".",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c2ej877g7w1o,Health,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/572e/live/8de9a860-a5a6-11f0-b741-177e3e2c2fc7.jpg,2025-10-10T06:48:16.182000+00:00,332c5fdb7f3f5cb7417db8e864ef255107810ba1

The evidence for the benefits of spending time in nature is compelling enough that some areas have trialled so called green social prescribing connecting people with nature to improve their phsyical and mental health, with a positive impact on happiness and wellbeing . 2. Your hormones reboot Your body's hormonal system also joins in the relaxation act. Willis says that spending time outdoors triggers our endocrine system and lowers levels of cortisol and adrenaline - the hormones that surge when you're stressed or anxious. ""A study found that people in a hotel room for three days who were breathing in Hinoki (Japanese cypress) oil saw a big drop in the adrenaline hormone and a large increase in natural killer cells in their blood."" Natural killer cells are cells that tackle viruses in the body. The participants in the study still had elevated natural killer cells in their body two weeks after inhaling the smell. Essentially nature ""calms what needs calming and strengthens what needs strengthening,"" is how Prof Ming Kuo from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, summed it up to the BBC . ""A three-day weekend in nature has a huge impact on our virus fighting apparatus and even a month later it can be 24% above baseline."" Studies also show smaller but still persistent effects from shorter periods spent in nature, she says. 3. Smell is a powerful sense Smelling nature is just as powerful as seeing and hearing it. The scent of trees and soil is full of organic compounds released by plants and ""when you breathe them in, some molecules pass into the bloodstream."" Willis says pine is a good example of this as the smell of a pine forest can make you calmer within just 90 seconds and that effect lasts for about 10 minutes. You may think that the relaxing effect of nature is all in your mind, but another study found that even very young babies with no memory associated with particular smells, still calmed down when another scent associated with calming, limonene   was puffed into the room they were in. 4. Gets good bacteria into your gut Getty Images Touching soil can help your body adopt good bacteria As well as soothing your mind, nature can also help boost your microbiome as soil and plants are full of good bacteria. ""They're the same kinds of good bacteria we pay for in probiotics or drinks,"" Willis explains. Prof Ming Kuo has studied the effect on factors such as infection susceptibility as well as mental health and says breathing in certain ones have the potential to boost your mood; and the antimicrobial chemicals released by plants – called phytoncides – could help fight disease. Dr Chris van Tulleken says as an infection scientist he sees nature as a positively challenging environment that ""tickles your immune system"". He gets his children to play with dirt in the forest which then enters their system through the nose or mouth. Bring nature to you Getty Images Even having a nature screensaver on your laptop can help you relax Of course, not everyone can head into the woods on a whim but the good news is, you don't have to. Even small touches of nature at home can make a difference, according to Willis. Visually, flowers such as white or yellow roses have been shown to create the greatest calming effect on brain activity. When it comes to smell, use a diffuser with essential oils like pinene which can help you feel calm. And if all else fails, even a photo of a forest can help. Research shows that looking at pictures of nature on your laptop or simply gazing out at something green can trigger the same calming brainwave changes and reduce stress. ""Every bit seems to help,"" says Prof Ming Kuo.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvg0yvdjgn5o,Health,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/dfa1/live/aaf4fca0-a387-11f0-a56f-0b1b78ebdf89.jpg,2025-10-09T23:45:15.516000+00:00,fea44fd8e8d7d4a0ae48c30d3910c9ca7b0d57fd
911759bb5e00,NHS waiting list rises for third month in row,,"NHS waiting list rises for third month in row Nick Triggle Health correspondent Getty Images The hospital waiting list in England has risen for the third month in a row with experts warning the government's key NHS priority - tackling the backlog - is at risk. At the end of August the waiting list for routine treatments hit 7.41 million – in May it was 7.36 million. The proportion waiting longer than the target time of 18 weeks has also risen. Experts said the government was facing a significant challenge reducing waits, but ministers said its investment in the NHS would pay off. The government has promised that by the end of this parliament it will hit the 18-week waiting time target – something that has not been done for a decade. That requires 92% of patients, waiting for treatments such as knee and hip operations, to be seen within 18 weeks. Currently, 61% are. Over the summer waits worsened following a period of sustained progress after Labour came to power. Dr Francesca Cavallaro, of the Health Foundation think-tank, said on current trends the government would fall short on its pledge. ""The scale of the challenge remains significant."" Prof Peter Friend, of the Royal College of Surgeons of England, predicted the coming winter would be tough. ""The government must face facts: without urgent investment in NHS infrastructure and support for staff wellbeing, progress on reducing waiting times will remain slow. ""Surgeons are ready to do more but are held back by critical resource issues - a lack of operating time, staff vacancies and equipment. Patients deserve better."" Rory Deighton, of the NHS Confederation, which represents health bosses, said: ""NHS leaders and their teams are working incredibly hard to boost productivity. So it is deeply frustrating that waiting lists have gone up for the third month in a row. But Health Minister Stephen Kinnock defended the performance of the NHS. He said it had been a ""record-breaking"" summer with more tests and checks being done than ever before. ""We know there's more to do - that's why we're pressing ahead with new surgical hubs, evening and weekend scans, and cutting-edge technology to get millions more patients treated on time,"" he added.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cqje5ljdnygo,Health,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/a2f1/live/3869b8b0-a4f9-11f0-8e74-1f6664d312e9.jpg,2025-10-09T10:24:23.722000+00:00,a23c931a07404d6450a9536580ce43ced5fd0e52
dfd715e888a9,"Children harmed by decision to redeploy health visitors, Covid inquiry hears",,"Children harmed by decision to redeploy health visitors, Covid inquiry hears Vanessa Clarke Education reporter Getty Images A decision by the NHS to redeploy health visitors during the pandemic was ""fundamentally flawed"" and ""children were harmed"" as a result, the head of a health visiting charity has told the Covid inquiry. Many health visitors were sent to work in other parts of the NHS at the beginning of the pandemic. Alison Morton, CEO of the Institute of Health Visiting, told the inquiry it was ""inappropriate"" as they ""were needed most on their own front line"". NHS England's Chief Nursing Officer Duncan Burton told the inquiry its response to safeguarding did not stop throughout the pandemic despite staff being diverted to critical services. Health visitors in almost two thirds of trusts in England were redeployed in March 2020, according to research by University College London. The intention was that they would go to work in hospitals to support acutely ill patients but some were sent to do administration, to deliver parcels and to answer telephones, the inquiry heard. Some health visitors who remained in post were left with case loads of 750 children or more, way above the recommended 250, evidence provided by Prof Catherine Davies, of Leeds University, to the inquiry showed. ""We let families down"", Ms Morton told the inquiry, saying protection was not afforded to babies and that ""some children paid the highest price"". The inquiry was shown research by the child safeguarding review practice panel which identified Covid adaptions, such as virtual visits as opposed to home visits by health visitors, as factors in the deaths and serious incidents of some children. Children like Star Hobson and Arthur Labinjo-Hughes - who were both killed by their guardians during the pandemic - hit the headlines but there were many others, Ms Morton told the inquiry. ""Children were being harmed by these practices,"" she said. ""It had life-changing and life-ending consequences for these children and they were the canary in the coalmine and we needed to listen to them and make their voices count even in their deaths"". ""For me, it was the most sad part of the pandemic, how we let those children down"", Ms Morton added. The Institute of Health Visiting - a charity and professional body that works to strengthen the quality and consistency of health visiting practice - said it was in regular contact with the government in the summer of 2020 raising concerns. It said a letter was eventually sent by the Chief Nursing Officer for England to trusts in October 2020 saying redeployments must end. The body also had to make ""a strong intervention"" for there not to be another redeployment in December 2020, the inquiry was told. The inquiry is due to hear evidence from those who were in government at the time in the next two weeks. Earlier, Duncan Burton, the Chief Nursing Officer for England told the inquiry, at the start of pandemic, the NHS was dealing with a new virus and staff had to be freed up to help with critical services. He said NHS England's response to safeguarding activity did not stop throughout the pandemic but it did change. ""For example, we made sure that the staff in testing centres were trained around safeguarding and what the things they might need to look for. ""And as more clinical contacts happened online, we needed to make sure that the kind of guidance around online factored in the safeguarding needs of children."" The inquiry also heard about the decision by the NHS to keep children out of the healthcare system unless essential and to pause elective procedures for children in March 2020. The NHS was focusing on freeing up beds for critical care, the inquiry heard, and Mr Burton said ""we had to focus on that"". They did not suggest stopping anything that was urgent, Mr Burton said but ""there was a balance of prioritisation"". Children's waiting lists grew at twice the rate of adult list during the recovery period after the pandemic, NHS England data which was shown to the inquiry indicated. Mr Burton's evidence noted that children's procedures being seen ""as less of a priority compared to, for example, adult cancer treatment"" was one of the reasons for the rise in children's waiting lists size. He said the fact that children's operations are mainly done in more specialist hospitals and there is a smaller workforce might also have added to delays. Some of the biggest waiting lists are for speech and language appointments - with schools seeing a huge increase in students needing additional help. Children were ""hugely and in some cases irretrievably damaged"" by the indirect consequences of the pandemic, Prof Steve Turner, from the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health, told the inquiry. ""They are 25% of the population and get 11% of the NHS spend."" They are not treated equally in our society and became a lower priority in the pandemic and in the recovery period, Prof Turner said. This part of the Covid inquiry is looking at the impact of the pandemic on children and young people, and whether they were considered in key decisions made by government.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c1jz3n126kwo,Health,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/8c97/live/867a0080-a465-11f0-8c79-29eeaf2ea52d.jpg,2025-10-08T18:42:37.026000+00:00,b419a1e101fccb6f90398e813c9e0f82105f39e2
d5c48e21652f,Pharmacies facing angry patients over Covid jab confusion,,"Pharmacies facing angry patients over Covid jab confusion Nick Triggle health correspondent and Jim Reed health reporter PA Media (File photo) Pharmacists in England say they are facing ""major issues"" with large numbers of patients booking appointments for Covid jabs only to find they are no longer eligible. The criteria have been tightened this year so that only those aged 75 and older are being offered free boosters, along with younger patients who have a weakened immune system. Between a third and a half of people who turn up for their appointment are having to be turned away at many sites, according to Community Pharmacy England (CPE), which represents more than 10,000 chemists including many major chains. It has described the situation as ""unacceptable"" with reports of angry, frustrated patients and abuse aimed at staff. CPE director of NHS services Alastair Buxton said it had become clear within an hour of the NHS website booking system going live last week that there was a problem. He said lots of people appeared to be missing the information about eligibility on the booking system and making the assumption they were still eligible. But when they turn up for their vaccinations pharmacies are only able to give them the flu jab. ""That obviously takes a lot of explaining to patients. It causes upset, concern and maybe anger for some patients. ""We've certainly had examples of some patients becoming abusive with pharmacy team members."" As well as shouting abuse, Dr Leyla Hannbeck, of the Independent Pharmacies Association, said she was even aware of patients throwing objects at staff. ""This is unacceptable,"" she added. Patients have also been telling Your Voice, Your BBC News that they have been receiving text messages from the NHS and their GP asking them to come forward for their Covid jab despite not being eligible. Henry Gregg, head of the National Pharmacy Association, which represents independent pharmacists, says the issues have been raised with NHS England and the government. ""This should have been avoidable and it is deeply frustrating for both pharmacies and patients. We urge any patient in this situation to treat pharmacy teams with respect as pharmacies try and manage the new NHS clinical criteria."" Pharmacists said more should have been done to make people aware of the changes - given the flu and Covid vaccine programmes largely over-lapped last year. In response to the problems, NHS England said the wording on the website had been changed to make it clearer the eligibility criteria had been tightened. A spokeswoman added: ""Please double check you are still eligible to receive a Covid vaccine before booking – the NHS website sets out whether your age, health condition or medication means you are eligible, and your GP practice or pharmacist will confirm this before giving you the vaccine."" And a Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: ""Abuse of our hard-working pharmacists is totally unacceptable - we expect pharmacy providers to report any inappropriate incidents where necessary."" Family handout Paul Williamson, 71, says he was disappointed to find out he was no longer eligible for the Covid vaccine Paul Williamson, aged 71, from Doncaster, is one of those who has only just discovered he is no longer eligible for the Covid booster. He did realise when he logged on to the booking site and told Your Voice, Your BBC News he was shocked to find out the criteria had changed. ""I'm disappointed. It feels like a cost-cutting exercise."" As an older person, he said he would do everything possible to protect himself and so would now consider paying for it privately. Covid vaccines are available privately at high street pharmacists and cost around £100 per person. Changes in eligibility The changes to eligibility were made on the advice of a group of independent experts called the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI). It recommended that eligibility for the Covid autumn booster should be changed from 2025. Last year the jab was offered for free to anyone 65 years old and over and those with a long list of chronic or long-term conditions. That's now been changed with the age limit raised to all those who turn 75 before January 2026, plus residents in care homes for older adults and people classed as immunosuppressed. That includes those undergoing some cancer treatment and transplant patients, along with those living with HIV and some genetic disorders. But it means many people with conditions such as diabetes, heart disease, respiratory illneses, asthma and severe mental illness will no longer qualify. In addition, pregnant women and frontline health and social care workers will not be offered the jab for free this autumn. The JCVI said Covid was now a ""relatively mild disease for most people"", with rates of hospitalisation and death having ""reduced significantly"". It said focusing on the oldest adults and individuals whose immune systems are compromised, as the two groups who continue to be at higher risk, was based on ""a standard cost-effectiveness assessment, in line with other routine vaccinations"".

Dorinnia Carville said about 12,000 operations, which include tummy tucks and tonsillectomies, were carried out in 2023-24 without any assurance they complied with government policy. Ms Carville described the lack of oversight by the Department of Health and the trusts as ""very disappointing"". The Department of Health and the five health trusts acknowledged the concerns raised in the Audit Office report and accepted that oversight arrangements must be strengthened. Health trusts must adhere to the Effective Use of Resources (EUR) policy which restricts 29 medical procedures, with six of these not permitted at all. The Audit Office report found 40 restricted procedures were carried out each day during that year. Other restricted procedures include liposuction, breast reduction, removal of breast implants, carpal tunnel and tattoo removal. About £6m was spent in a single year on removing patients' tonsils. Dorinnia Carville's report found health trusts had not put any arrangements in place to verify this Procedures such as the repair of split ear lobes, fixing simple snoring and the reversal of male and female sterilisation are not permitted. The auditor general found the EUR policy was ""not resulting in good value for money being achieved"". She said: ""Trusts have not put in place arrangements to verify that medical staff are complying with the policy."" ""At a time when our health service is facing increased demands and significant financial pressures, measures introduced to ensure the effective use of resources are vital. ""However, these can only be successful if they are properly implemented and monitored."" While some of the thousands of procedures performed may have been permissible under the policy, the report found health trusts had not put any arrangements in place to verify this. No such assurances were provided by trusts during 2023-24, and none was sought by the department, said the auditor general. The report recommends that trusts introduce arrangements for monitoring and complying with the rules, and for the Department of Health to ensure they are doing so. It is also calling on the department to review the rules policy every two years. The Department of Health said it was committed to working collaboratively over the next 12 months to implement the recommendations. ""It must be emphasised that the EUR commissioning position is there to guide clinicians who must continue to exercise their professional judgment in providing appropriate, timely care,"" a spokesperson added. ""While there is an onus to take account of the position, other factors must also be taken into account, including patient safety.""",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvgq6x94np6o,Health,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/ee72/live/14279840-a455-11f0-8a21-ff96e44d1cc2.jpg,2025-10-08T07:01:32.803000+00:00,6ff642adf1ac17ca57283dbee059e34fea1f0ba3
4f2df46a9593,'My eyesight might have been saved if I'd gone to the optician sooner',,"'My eyesight might have been saved if I'd gone to the optician sooner' Aileen Moynagh BBC News NI health reporter 'Had I known that you could have such a sudden loss of sight, I wouldn't have waited' A woman who has been left with partial sight after she delayed seeking medical help said she wishes she had gone to an optician when she first had symptoms as her vision could have been saved. Gail Cairns, from Belfast, started experiencing sight loss, headaches, and eye pain in July 2025, but waited four days before getting her eyes checked. After being scanned at an opticians through a free NHS scheme she was immediately referred to hospital for treatment. She had a serious eye condition that had left permanent damage. Getty Images Detailed scans by the optician showed damage to her optic nerve because of swelling in her brain Mrs Cairns was diagnosed with Non-Arteritic Anterior Ischemic Optic Neuropathy (NA-AION) and Pseudo Foster-Kennedy syndrome. Detailed scans by the optician showed damage to her optic nerve because of swelling in her brain. She was treated in hospital with steroids to reduce the swelling, but said ""unfortunately the damage was done"". It has been ""life changing"" and she can no longer drive. ""If I had known about this condition and how quickly things can change, I would have gone on the Monday. ""The likelihood is that I would still be able to drive, and do all the normal things that I was doing,"" she said. The 60-year-old said day-to-day things like cooking, going up and down stairs, reading to her grandchildren and putting on make-up are now difficult. But she said the ""hardest part was in the hospital whenever my three-year-old granddaughter was sitting on the bed, and I couldn't make out any of her features"". ""I just took a lump in my throat, and it was like somebody punched me in the stomach. ""That was the first time I teared up over it,"" she said. Mrs Cairns had annual eye tests because of a family history of glaucoma but wants to encourage anyone with sudden changes in their eyes to act quickly. ""Even the slightest change - don't put it off - get it seen to by an optician immediately."" She is thankful that she has not lost her sight completely. Much like a GP, an optometrist is a primary care provider who is specialised in detecting and correcting conditions that affect vision and eye health. An optometrist is trained to recognise abnormalities in eyes, and many provide enhanced services, including same day NIPEARS appointments for urgent eye care issues, like how Mrs Cairns was seen. It is a service for patients who have developed a sudden eye problem within the previous 14 days, such as: Pain and/or discomfort in the eyes, or around the eye area Sudden reduction in vision in one or both eyes Recent onset or sudden increase of flashes and/or floaters in one or both eyes Something in your eye that you cannot remove yourself Sam Baird stresses the importance of early intervention The service has been running since 2018, with more than 90% of practices providing the service, including Sam Baird's in Dundonald where Mrs Cairns went. ""Gail came in at 4 o'clock on a Friday afternoon with very painful eyes, not able to see clearly. ""We got drops to make her eyes more comfortable. We scanned her and assessed that she needed urgent attention at the hospital,"" he said. He was able to provide her with the scans of the optic nerve, ""which are diagnostic of the condition, which meant that when she got to the Ulster Hospital she was admitted immediately as opposed to waiting for hours"". This meant Mrs Cairns could start treatment immediately. Mr Baird stressed the importance of getting your eyes checked as soon as symptoms appear as sight loss can happen very quickly. While he said Mrs Cairn's case is rare, if she'd come in earlier in the week there might have been a different outcome. ""Those are the small cases where it can make a very dramatic difference. ""Opticians have the specialised equipment to do proper scans and a proper investigation of the eyes - something that the emergency room and GPs don't have."" Mr Baird said the NIPEARS system is reducing pressure on ""two ends"" of the health service. ""We're taking the pressure off the GPs by taking care of minor eye conditions and we're taking pressure off the ophthalmology hospital clinics because they're not  filled with unnecessary referrals,"" he said. According to the Royal National Institute of Blind people (RNIB) , every day 250 people start to lose their sight in the UK, which is equivalent to one person every six minutes. The charity says more than two million people are living with sight loss in the UK and half of them are blind and partially sighted and live with a long-term irreversible eye health condition. The RNIB said it is predicted that by 2050 the number of people with sight loss in the UK will double to more than four million. Raymond Curran says half of all sight loss is avoidable In September 2025, the Department of Health (DoH) highlighted the ""vital role of community optometry in improving access to care and shaping the future of eyecare in Northern Ireland"". Raymond Curran, the DoH's Head of Ophthalmic Services is encouraging people to look after their eyes as ""50% of all sight loss is avoidable"". He said ""primary care optometrists"" should be the first port of call for eyes, as GPs are experiencing capacity issues. ED eye departments are struggling to cope with increased demand. The DoH said it is committed to making it easier for patients to access the care they need, and that community optometry shows how services delivered closer to home can detect problems early, reduce waiting lists, and ease pressure on hospitals.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c87yzywrrdjo,Health,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/4a7e/live/02e28580-a528-11f0-92db-77261a15b9d2.jpg,2025-10-08T23:10:14.783000+00:00,4921fee5ac3ce09ce92e90abb1217c12054b330e
c3dbf0dd6f4d,"Alarming number of people now vape, says WHO",,"Alarming number of people now vape, says WHO Michelle Roberts Digital health editor Getty Images More than 100 million people, including at least 15 million children, use e-cigarettes, fuelling a new wave of nicotine addiction, the World Health Organization (WHO) is warning. Children are, on average, nine times more likely than adults to vape, it says, based on available global figures. The WHO's Dr Etienne Krug said e-cigarettes were fuelling a ""new wave"" of nicotine addiction. ""They are marketed as harm reduction but, in reality, are hooking kids on nicotine earlier and risk undermining decades of progress."" WHO Director General, Dr Tedros, accused the tobacco industry of ""aggressively targeting"" young people. Teens being 'targeted' ""Millions of people are stopping, or not taking up, tobacco use thanks to tobacco control efforts by countries around the world,"" he said. ""In response to this strong progress, the tobacco industry is fighting back with new nicotine products, aggressively targeting young people. Governments must act faster and stronger in implementing proven tobacco-control policies,"" he added. The vaping figures are an estimate since some countries - 109 in all, and many in African and South-East Asia - do not gather data. According to the report, as of February this year, at least 86 million e-cigarette users were adults, mostly in high-income countries. And at least 15 million teenagers aged between 13 and 15  already vape, based on surveys from 123 countries. While many nations have made efforts to introduce e-cigarettes regulations to tackle child vaping in recent years, by the end of 2024, 62 countries still had no policy in place, and 74 countries had no minimum age at which e-cigarettes may be purchased, says the WHO. Meanwhile, tobacco use has been decreasing - from an estimated 1.38 billion users in 2000 to 1.2 billion in 2024. Prevalence of tobacco use among women dropped the most - from 11% in 2010 to 6.6% in 2024. Among men, the decrease was from 41.4% in 2010 to 32.5% in 2024. But one in five adults globally still uses tobacco. Smoking is linked to many diseases, including cancer. Experts say vaping is far less harmful than cigarettes, and can help you quit smoking. It is not recommended for non-smokers. E-cigarettes do not burn tobacco and do not produce tar or carbon monoxide, two of the most damaging elements in tobacco smoke. They contain nicotine, which can be addictive.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c1kwxjzeez3o,Health,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/0150/live/57488580-a2bb-11f0-928c-71dbb8619e94.jpg,2025-10-06T12:34:03.707000+00:00,b5f645df12dab4fa0ff17f2eaada8b574fe3fb84
5685024f493e,First-year resident doctors back strike action over jobs shortage,,"Newly-qualified doctors in their first year of practice in England have voted in favour of strike action in a row over a shortage of jobs. The British Medical Association (BMA) union says thousands of resident doctors are ending up without speciality training places when they finish year two of training. This year there were 10,000 jobs available for 30,000 candidates, although some of those will be doctors from abroad. The issue was already being discussed by the BMA and government in talks that got under way following a pay strike in July. But by formally gaining a mandate for strike action it opens up a new avenue for industrial action. Some 97% of those who voted back strike action on a turnout of 65%. Dr Jack Fletcher, chair of the BMA's resident doctors committee, said: ""Doctors have spoken clearly - they won't accept that they face a career of insecurity at a time when the demand for doctors is huge. ""The numbers are absurd - more than 10,000 doctors applied this year to become psychiatrists with less than 500 able to get a place, yet patients are still experiencing significant waits at a detriment to their health."" GP unemployment is getting worse, he said, with five doctors applying for every GP training post, while patient demand for appointments continues to increase. ""It makes no sense that despite the need to bring down waiting lists and increase capacity for patients to be seen, thousands of willing and skilled doctors are unable to find the work to begin treating them."" He described the government's current pledge – set out under the 10-year NHS plan – to increase training places by 1,000 as paltry. The BMA has argued a big factor in the shortage has been poor workforce planning which has seen a rapid expansion in medical school places at university, but a failure to create enough training posts in the NHS. Dr Fletcher added: ""By putting these two disputes – pay and jobs – together, we are now giving government a chance to create a plan that supports and develops the workforce of the next generation. ""Patients need doctors to have jobs. Doctors need to know they will have jobs. And they need to know they will be paid what they're worth."" Health Secretary Wes Streeting, however, has been adamant that he will not negotiate on pay and, instead, his team have kept the talks centred on working conditions, exam fees, rotas and career progression. It comes after resident doctors were awarded a 22% pay rise over the last two years, with another 5.4% increase this year. The BMA says pay is still a fifth lower than it was in 2008, once inflation is taken into account. Health Minister Stephen Kinnock said: ""Training bottlenecks are a very real issue for resident doctors, which is why the government is already working on a range of measures to tackle them."" Alongside the additional 1,000 training places, he said steps were also being taken to prioritise UK graduates for posts. ""The result is that current first-year doctors will emerge from their foundation training into a very different professional landscape from that which exists today,"" he added.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cly147075p2o,Health,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/b567/live/b3b82fb0-a2dd-11f0-b741-177e3e2c2fc7.jpg,2025-10-06T18:51:14.420000+00:00,1a8b5ba7819c67cbb20ad9b1cc80e67f284d1464
fe2b6b67dcc7,Former England captain Moody reveals MND diagnosis,,"Elite athletes are disproportionately affected by MND, with a study of Italian footballers suggesting the rate of the disease is up to six times higher than in the general population. It is thought that by limiting the oxygen available and causing damage to motor neurone cells, regular, strenuous exercise can trigger the disease in those already genetically susceptible. Moody, who won 71 England caps and toured with the British and Irish Lions in New Zealand in 2005, was nicknamed 'Mad Dog' during his playing career, in honour of his fearless, relentless approach to the game. He played through a stress fracture of his leg for a time with Leicester and once sparked a training-ground scuffle with team-mate and friend Martin Johnson when, frustrated, he abandoned a tackle pad and started throwing himself into tackles. After coming on as a replacement in the Rugby World Cup final win over Australia in 2003, he claimed a ball at the back of the line-out in the decisive passage of play, setting a platform for scrum-half Matt Dawson to snipe and Jonny Wilkinson to kick the match-winning drop-goal. Moody has already told Johnson, who captained England to that title, and a couple of other former England team-mates about his diagnosis. Geordan Murphy and Leon Lloyd, who Moody played alongside at Leicester, have set up a fundraising page to help support him and his family. But many of Moody's former team-mates will be learning his news with the rest of the public. ""There will be a time when we'll need to lean on their support but, at the minute, just having that sort of love and acknowledgment that people are there is all that matters,"" he said. ""Rugby is such a great community. ""I said to the kids the other day, I've had an incredible life. ""Even if it ended now, I've enjoyed all of it and embraced all of it and got to do it with unbelievable people. ""When you get to call your passion your career, it's one of the greatest privileges. ""To have done it for so long with the teams that I did it with was a pleasure. And I know they will want to support in whatever way they can and I look forward to having those conversations.""",https://www.bbc.com/sport/rugby-union/articles/cz7rddrrlqno,Health,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/branded_sport/1200/cpsprodpb/d040/live/48ea27d0-a1f5-11f0-928c-71dbb8619e94.jpg,2025-10-06T06:00:04.019000+00:00,40e84496f1e5f627f735661201349bd0fd28421e
1f2e5b95d6dd,Top NHS boss backed surgeon whose failures contributed to deaths,,"Top NHS boss backed surgeon whose failures contributed to deaths Michael Buchanan Social affairs correspondent and Adam Eley LinkedIn Karen Booth carried out operations she wasn't skilled enough to perform, an NHS investigation found The head of NHS England backed a doctor whose failures contributed to several deaths to resume her career as a heart surgeon. Sir Jim Mackey told the family of a patient who died following an operation carried out by Karen Booth that the consultant surgeon should be ""supported"" to continue working at the Freeman Hospital, in Newcastle, once she had undergone retraining. The BBC has obtained a recording of a meeting last year with the family of the man who died. In it, he tells them Ms Booth will continue her surgical career. An NHS investigation found problems in Ms Booth's cases included clinical errors, carrying out operations she was not skilled or experienced enough to perform, and failing to call for help when she should have. Sir Jim became head of NHS England in April. Before that he was chief executive of the Newcastle upon Tyne Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, which runs the Freeman, for 14 months. Sir Jim declined to answer most of the BBC's questions but said: ""We have taken concerns from all parties extremely seriously and this has been a really complex case in what is a very specialised clinical field, and it had been ongoing for several years."" In a statement to the BBC, Karen Booth said she continued ""to express my condolences to the families who have lost loved ones and who have been affected by the matters raised"".  She said she was ""cooperating fully"" with a review by the doctors' regulator, the General Medical Council (GMC). Sir Jim Mackey told the family Ms Booth ""has to go through a process of being supported, retrained"" Seven people died following multiple failures by Ms Booth, an internal investigation found, with one patient surviving having experienced avoidable harm. The BBC has revealed the hospital now plans to allow Ms Booth to resume her surgical career in the cardiac unit after retraining. That is despite strong opposition from many of her surgical colleagues, set out in emails. Ms Booth, a heart and transplant surgeon , is currently working as a mentor to other surgeons at the hospital. In January 2024, shortly after being appointed as chief executive of the trust, Sir Jim met the family of Ian Philip, a construction worker from Northumberland, who died in 2021 aged 54, after being operated on by Ms Booth. The hospital later told his family that the surgeons operating on him had failed to carry out a ""bread and butter"" procedure known as a graft bypass when they experienced complications, something that the hospital told them would have made his survival ""much more likely"". The BBC obtained a recording of a meeting attended by Mr Philip's partner Melissa Cockburn and his son Liam. Sir Jim told them Ms Booth could continue her surgical career because she had not been sanctioned by the GMC or by an internal HR investigation. Family photo Newcastle upon Tyne Hospitals NHS Trust has apologised to Ian Philip's family over the care he received ""She has to go through a process of being supported, retrained, her practice managed etc over a period of time before she's allowed to practise fully independently again,"" said Sir Jim. ""We, as an employer, have to decide whether that is here or somewhere else."" The BBC understands the Freeman Hospital has approached at least one other trust to ask whether they would be willing to employ Ms Booth. Mr Philip's family told the BBC they were astonished by Sir Jim's remarks. ""It's bizarre to me that the Freeman would think that it's appropriate [to bring her back],"" said Ian's son, Liam Philip. ""The least they can do is say she's not coming back."" Sir Jim became chief executive of the Newcastle upon Tyne Hospital Trust on 1 January 2024. The family said they had hoped his appointment at the trust would help their case. ""[We] went through Christmas with great hope, thinking he's a new man coming in to sort everything out,"" recalled Melissa, Mr Philip's partner. But she said she had ultimately found Sir Jim ""quite arrogant and more supportive of Ms Booth than our predicament"". Many of Ms Booth's surgical colleagues had made it repeatedly clear to the trust's senior leadership that they did not want her to return to the cardiac unit, believing it a risk to patients. This was an issue Sir Jim also appeared to recognise. At one point in the meeting, he said that if colleagues were not willing to support a surgeon, ""the risk to safety is much heightened."" In her statement, Ms Booth said she was ""grateful to those surgical and wider departmental colleagues who continue to support my reintegration back into full clinical practice"". Ian Philip's partner, Melissa Cockburn and son Liam, say they were shocked by Sir Jim's comments The family said their unhappiness with Sir Jim has been exacerbated by the fact the GMC had lifted restrictions on Ms Booth's practice following an initial investigation. Asked to explain why a doctor whose failures had contributed to the deaths of multiple patients was allowed to continue practising surgery in the NHS and what this says about the importance it places on public safety, the GMC declined to comment. It told the BBC: ""Patient safety is at the core of everything we do, and we will always take action where there is a risk to the public."" When asked to give examples, it declined. Patient groups have long complained that the GMC takes too long to take action against medics. It can investigate doctors who are referred to it and decide whether a case is passed to a medical tribunal, which has the power to sanction staff. Figures show that since 2020, of the 1,120 cases the GMC has passed to a medical tribunal, just 13 were to do with a doctor's performance. Asked to explain why the figures are so low, the GMC declined to comment. Problematic working culture In a statement to the BBC, Sir Jim said that after joining the Newcastle upon Tyne Hospitals Trust, he had met families affected by Ms Booth's failures ""to discuss and listen to their concerns and reiterate how sorry we are for their loss and the unimaginable hurt caused"". Mr Mackey continued: ""Following the formal referral made to the General Medical Council in 2022, the investigation into this surgeon's practice is still ongoing – I recognise this is frustrating for everyone, and I have asked them what they can do to expedite this to reach a conclusion as soon as possible. ""This surgeon is still not operating in the NHS."" Ms Booth said that due to the GMC review, ""it would not be appropriate for me to comment publicly on specific matters at this time"". An investigation by the Freeman Hospital found a number of failures by Ms Booth had contributed to her poor outcomes. As well as surgical errors, she was found to have had poor insight into her own levels of competence, partly through being inexperienced, and that she had failed to seek help from more senior colleagues. At the time of the complaints, the cardiac unit at the Freeman was in disarray. A Royal College of Surgeons report in 2021 found a problematic working culture, while internal hospital reports criticised poor governance procedures, a reluctance from senior staff to take responsibility and an inadequate multi-disciplinary team (MDT) process - in which clinicians should come together prior to surgery to discuss the best options for patients. Responding to the BBC, the hospital acknowledged the problems with the unit's culture, saying it tried to protect patients at all times. It said it was ""currently considering"" the next stage of Ms Booth's phased return, ""in line with appropriate standards, review recommendations and external advice"". It did not respond to the BBC's questions as to whether it was safe for patients for Ms Booth to return to the cardiac unit, given the strong opposition from some of her colleagues. In a statement, the Newcastle upon Tyne Hospitals NHS Trust said it acts ""in the best interests of patients"" and seeks ""to maintain and protect patient safety at all times, taking account of concerns shared by clinical colleagues"".",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn0rpdjd39po,Health,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/04a1/live/6b953710-a034-11f0-b741-177e3e2c2fc7.jpg,2025-10-03T02:08:52.258000+00:00,f4ed2f02b4ff28007750cdc42a5322b603a8d60d
3f2efdba26f3,'Why won't anyone give my son access to healthcare?',,"'Why won't anyone give my son access to healthcare?' Alice Cunningham in Brandeston Richard Knights/BBC Chantal Chaervey has struggled for years to get her son with cerebral palsy access to healthcare services since he turned 18 When Chantal Chaervey's son with cerebral palsy lost access to healthcare services at 18, she did not imagine she would be fighting four years on to change this. As a child, Harry Chaervey, 22, from Brandeston, Suffolk, was diagnosed with epilepsy and cerebral palsy, a condition that affects movement and co-ordination. Throughout his time at a specialist school, Harry, who is non-verbal, enjoyed access to hydrotherapy — a form of physiotherapy involving exercise in a warm pool that helps with movement. But when he left school, his mother struggled to get him access through the NHS and believed without it, his life would be limited. Ms Chaervey, 65, said the past few years had been ""hell"" and she called for answers. Alice Cunningham/BBC Ms Chaervey said Harry was born with a rare condition that later led to his cerebral palsy and epilepsy diagnosis Ms Chaervey explained Harry had two liver transplants when he was just 16 and 18 weeks old, but both failed, leading to organ failure and brain damage before he was diagnosed with cerebral palsy. She said despite that, he had always been ""a joy"", and as a child, he loved to play football. ""No one could stop him from running,"" she explained. ""I've got a very vivid image of a teacher trying to control him on sports day, holding him by the seat of his shorts because he just wanted to run. ""He was a joy, and he still is. However all of a sudden things changed."" Contributed Harry benefited from hydrotherapy at his specialist school and during a previous holiday camp Ms Chaervey said without the hydrotherapy, Harry had ""completely lost the use of his legs"", meaning when he wants to move, he either has to shuffle on his knees or he has to use a wheelchair. She said he was in ""constant"" pain, his epilepsy had worsened, he was at risk of sudden unexpected death in epilepsy, and he struggled to chew food, sometimes leading to choking. Ms Chaervey said Harry was also suffering from depression. Alice Cunningham/BBC Ms Chaervey said she had hoped to eventually return to her career, but could not see this happening without help to care for her son Ms Chaervey applied for NHS Continuing Healthcare that could have funded Harry's care, but she was told he was not eligible. She then applied for two exceptional funding requests to get him access to hydrotherapy, but they were similarly denied. Earlier this year, she applied for a third time and was still waiting to hear back. It comes despite doctors and physiotherapists recommending Harry for hydrotherapy, with one stating in a letter that it ""may well end up being more than any medication change that I can make"". Ms Chaervey said access to hydrotherapy would mean ""everything"" to Harry, and she believed just half an hour a week could help. Contributed Ms Chaervey said Harry could not stop moving as a child and enjoyed running around Heather Epps, a physiotherapist with expertise in hydrotherapy for cerebral palsy patients, said it could ""improve quality of life"" thanks to the benefits it had in pain reduction and its ability to improve muscle function. ""One of the reasons you get pain is because your muscles are pulling against your bones, pulling them into abnormal positions, so your posture isn't great and then because your posture isn't great, it becomes a bit of a vicious cycle,"" she explained. ""You can't fidget and move, as you or I could, in order to relieve that pressure and reduce that discomfort. ""Whereas once you're in the pool, you can undertake those movements because you've not got that increase in spasticity and stiffness within your muscles that you have when you're out of the water."" Emma Livingstone formed the charity Up when she found there was a lack of provisions for adults with cerebral palsy Emma Livingstone is the founder and chief executive officer of charity Up - The Adult Cerebral Palsy Movement. She said access to healthcare services for adults with cerebral palsy, of which there are about 130,000 in the UK, was a serious issue, and she herself had struggled. ""We are comparably sized to Multiple Sclerosis and Parkinson's, and yet our visibility and the services that we do receive pale in significance,"" she said. She said the issue stemmed from the fact that the condition, up until recently, was not recognised as being long-term, as well as the fact that there was ""no one professional that coordinates care"" for cerebral palsy patients due there being many types of cerebral palsy. Richard Knights/BBC Because Harry cannot walk, he will shuffle on his knees around his home Ms Chaervey wants answers to why there is no clear NHS framework for adults with cerebral palsy. ""How is it that the care they have needed all their younger lives is not needed as they get older,"" she questioned. ""Are they suddenly cured, because if they are, please tell me, it would make my life better. ""It is a complete farce. It is time the NHS realised there are cerebral palsy adult patients with very complex situations suffering with chronic pain every hour of every day."" 'Happy to talk' A spokesperson for NHS Suffolk and North East Essex Integrated Care Board said all applications for exceptional funding were considered by a panel of healthcare professionals, ""with a focus on the clinical needs of the patient"". ""Where an application is not successful, there is an appeals process open to all,"" they added. ""We'd be very happy to talk directly with the family of the patient to explain the situation."" A spokesperson for the Department of Health and Social Care added it was ""committed to ensuring people living with cerebral palsy get the right support throughout their lives"". ""We expect NHS England to work with children, young people, families and carers to provide high-quality services, such as hydrotherapy, for people as they transition into adult services,"" they said.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3dr4v3vz3lo,Health,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/8053/live/69655560-a04d-11f0-b76f-25c45ed3060d.jpg,2025-10-07T05:11:11.357000+00:00,1201e558a7a24580ec093e0d87db91cdce8be5c6
5e5722bd11f0,"Is it a cold, flu or Covid – and how to avoid the worst",,"Is it a cold, flu or Covid – and how to avoid the worst Dr Oscar Duke Doctor and BBC Morning Live expert, London Getty Images Chances are you know someone coughing and spluttering - hopefully not directly on you -  right now. There are lots of coughs and colds doing the rounds as autumn draws in. But why now, how do you know if it's more than just a cold and how can you avoid the worst. Medical doctor Dr Oscar Duke, who is also a regular TV presenter including on the BBC's Morning Live, shares his top tips. Does colder weather cause colds? Getty Images Research on the extent to which cold weather impacts our immune systems remains unclear. But darker days mean we typically make a beeline for warm, cosy, indoor spaces. And this environment is perfect for viruses. It's also when young children get back together at school after the summer holidays. School and nursery can be like a petri dish with lots of viruses circulating and they may well bring these germs home with them. The same applies to freshers in university halls - where mixing together spreads germs, while heavy drinking and partying further weaken the immune system. Is it a cold, flu or Covid? Colds Symptoms appear gradually Mostly affect nose and throat Early sign - pressure in your ears Chestier, mucus cough Flu Comes on suddenly Feel wiped out Fever, muscle aches, exhaustion Need bed rest Dry cough Covid Typical flu symptoms Loss of taste of smell Diarrhoea or tummy upset Many of the symptoms between cold, flu and more serious viruses like Covid, overlap. But there are some clues that might help you identify the exact culprit. If a cold's coming on, then it often does so gradually. It's going to affect your nose and the back of your throat, while some will get a tickling at the back of the mouth. Another early warning sign can be a build-up of pressure in the ear. If the virus spreads further, it can reach your lungs and cause a pesky cough. Mostly however, these symptoms don't stop us from carrying on as normal. The same can't be said for flu, which typically adds aches, fevers and muscle weakness into the mix. Flu doesn't mean you have to go to bed, but it might make you feel that way. Since the pandemic, Covid has complicated things further, with similar symptons to flu. But one key Covid-specific identifier can be a loss of smell or taste. Another, as new variants Stratus and Nimbus spike this winter, is a ""razor-sharp"" sore throat . Diarrhoea is also common. The recommendation is to stay home and rest and recover. However, if you have underlying conditions, experience breathlessness or find symptoms don't ease after three weeks, then you shouldn't hesitate to seek medical advice. Can I help make myself better? Getty Images Our bodies naturally fight viruses and infection, but we can also give it a helping hand with the right medication. Paracetamol: Provided you're okay to take it, this or ibuprofen is the first port of call. Both are really good for helping to bring the fever down and softening any pain that you might have. But remember that lots of cough and cold mixtures include traces of paracetamol, so make sure you're not accidentally taking too much Vitamin C: This is often thought to help defend against colds. But there's not a huge amount of evidence for this. Unless you're deficient, focusing on a healthy, balanced diet is far more important Other stories you may enjoy Vitamin D: A top-up of vitamin D in colder months is recommended by the NHS, because let's face it, we don't usually get much sunlight at this time of year in the UK Decongestant spray: Sure, they feel great and provide instant relief, but using sprays too often can cause rebound congestion- when your nose becomes dependent and swells without a fix. I suggest using them for no more than four of five days Chicken soup: There's little evidence of the dish fighting viruses directly, but its heat can help warm the back of your throat and soothe some of those symptoms. It's also a good way to take on extra fluids, with hydration vital as you battle infection. What about vaccines? Getty Images It's  crucial to take the free annual flu jab if you're offered it. Eligibility is staggered across the population to prioritise those most at risk. If you have small children who were two or three on 31 August this year, then they are entitled.

8d97e7ca08a9,I went undercover as a cleaner at a failing care home. Here's what I witnessed,,"I went undercover as a cleaner at a failing care home. Here's what I witnessed Catriona MacPhee BBC Scotland Disclosure BBC Catriona worked for seven weeks as a cleaner at the care home In my seven weeks undercover in an overstretched care home I witnessed many scenes of poor care and distress but there was one incident that I suspect will remain with me for a long time. On the worst days, when staffing was at its lowest levels, the residents would sometimes shout for help as they heard my cleaning trolley rumbling past their rooms. Some were desperate for help to go to the toilet, others simply wanted to get washed and dressed for the day. As a cleaner, there was little I could do except offer words of comfort and assurances that I'd told the care staff. One day I sat with a woman in a nightie who needed help to be taken from her bed to the bathroom, just 8ft away. Her room echoed with signs of a life well lived - a proud career, foreign holidays with her loving family, an immaculately curated wardrobe of cashmere cardigans. As we waited for a carer to come, she begged me not to leave. She was becoming increasingly uncomfortable. I tried to distract her with small talk about the view and the weather. She listened until she could no longer hide her distress. As her physical capacity to wait for the toilet finally crumbled, she began to sob. I felt sadness many times in the care home but that totally avoidable loss of dignity was the first time I felt anger. Our investigation was sparked by an interview with Susan Christie, whose father spent two years in Castlehill, the largest care home in Inverness. It is billed as a luxury home and charges up to £1,800 per week. But Susan had become so concerned by the standard of her father's care that she installed a secret camera in his room - and she was appalled by what she saw. ""He wasn't being washed properly, he was being left in an incontinence pad for in excess of 12 hours, never taken to the toilet, food placed out of reach, spilling hot porridge on himself,"" she told us. ""It was neglect."" The final straw came when a cleaner was filmed restraining the elderly man and violently shaking the bed frame before prodding him with a walking stick. He was later sacked and Susan had nine complaints upheld by the Care Inspectorate. She moved her father out of Castlehill in May. In order to compare Castlehill to the 1,000 other care homes across Scotland, the BBC sent a Freedom of Information request to sector regulator, the Care Inspectorate, to ask which care homes in Scotland had the most complaints upheld against them. Castlehill topped the list with 10 complaints upheld in 2024. We interviewed a further four families who all had stories of similar concerns - but they were all historical. The only way to judge whether this was still going on was to go in and see for ourselves. We went through the rigorous BBC internal processes of asking for permission to secretly film. There was judged to be a significant public interest in evidence-gathering of this nature. Undercover filming shows distressed care home resident In May I found myself phoning the care home to ask if there were any cleaning jobs going. I was invited for an interview and asked to start immediately. At the same time, the home was in special measures due to improvement notices issued by the Care Inspectorate over a range of issues. They were under the spotlight - surely things would improve? What I found was an understaffed home that didn't have the right mix of staff to deal with the basic needs of residents, particularly those with dementia. This was leading to distress, aggressive behaviour and crisis situations. As I wheeled my cleaning trolley round the corridors, I was acutely aware of pleading faces peering out of bedrooms, hoping for a few minutes of company and conversation. Those people, at least, still hoped for a moment of human connection. I came to realise others had given up. Castlehil is the largest care home in Inverness and charges up to £1,800 per week One day I reassured a man who needed the toilet: ""I've told the carers, they say they're coming."" ""Aye, so is Christmas,"" he replied. Of all the things I tried to prepare for before going undercover I hadn't anticipated forming genuine bonds with the people who lived in there. The reality of this hit me one day while I sat in my car on a break and I was overwhelmed with emotion. Earlier, while cleaning one resident's room, I found myself retching because of the smell, unable to stay for longer than 20 seconds. The once-proud Highland gentleman whose room it was had been served his breakfast and had spent hours sitting alone in there. Nobody had thought to open his curtains or windows. At least I could walk out of there at the end of my shift. They couldn't. Catriona often found residents lying in wet clothes or on soiled sheets During my time in the home, I often found residents lying in wet clothes or on soiled sheets. I heard women screaming from behind closed doors because male carers were doing their intimate care. The impact of overstretched staff was clear. They had had a tick list of tasks to complete and often that was too long to include meaningful engagement, support with eating or unhurried continence care. There were some carers who strove to make the lives of residents better and who managed to carve out time in their busy days to engage but those moments were few and far between. Carers were paid £13 an hour to do intimate personal care, and much more, for people with very complex needs. This is in line with industry standards. I interviewed Donald McAskill of Scottish Care for the BBC Disclosure investigation. One of his quotes has stuck with me. ""You can get more for walking a dog through the meadows of Edinburgh than you can from sitting at somebody's bedside, holding their hand as they breathe their last,"" he said. ""For me, I find that obscene."" Staff often did not have time to spend time with residents The experts we interviewed were unanimous on one issue. They said the care sector is in crisis. They cited underfunding, staff shortages and unprecedented cuts to frontline dementia support services. With a backdrop of rising demand for care - the number of people with dementia is predicted to double by 2040 - all of the expert contributors in our film called for a nationwide conversation on the future of the sector. Families often told me that they had no option but to place their loved ones in a care home. It hadn't really been a choice, it was the result of a crisis or a lack of care support at home. The guilt weighed heavily on them, as did the burden of the complex financial arrangements that come with care homes. It's a situation that has, or will, touch most families at some point. Pools of urine on a care home corridor The job was not all doom and gloom. In my final week, a new activity leader began staging music concerts and playing the mandolin in the lounges, to the great joy of some residents. A new deputy manager also set her mind to the task of tackling the smell of urine that permeated the first floor. The residents were the unexpected highlight who kept me going when I found it hard to keep walking back through the front doors of Castlehill. One man stopped me in the corridor to tell me about his volunteering work and how much he enjoyed this time helping others. As we laughed about the situations he'd found himself in, he suddenly cut the conversation short. He said his bus was due any minute and he didn't want to miss it. It dawned on me that he thought we were two strangers chatting at the bus stop. Despite that not being the case, we both took joy from that human connection. I learned that with a few minutes of your time, you could encourage someone out of their shell or ease their confusion. That was all it took for them to walk away with a smile, or at least calmer than when they first approached you. Catriona said residents just wanted a human connection When I worked in the home I wore a secret camera, which was recording for most of the time. I worried that someone might spot the hidden lens, or the battery would fall out of my clothes. Luckily neither of those things happened. On one occasion I forgot to wear the fake glasses I had adopted as a partial disguise. I'm from the Highlands and was worried that someone from my home town would come into the home and recognise me, so the disguise gave me a small reassurance. Half way through a staff meeting, someone asked how I could see properly without my glasses on today? I bumbled my way through an explanation of not having had my coffee yet and leaving them in the car by mistake. It was a sloppy mistake that I didn't repeat. There were days when the camera failed, or the battery ran out. There were other days when I had to help the residents first and foremost, and was not able to switch the camera on. I was clear on one thing from the outset - my priority had to be the residents and their needs. That was the whole point of the investigation. Filming was secondary. There were some incidents of poor care that I did not record on camera but I left with a clear conscience. It was a privilege of this role to briefly cross paths with interesting, funny and charming characters, who led rich and colourful lives. We sang songs together, danced in the corridor, hugged, discussed all manner of topics - from Caravaggio and Gaelic lessons to Donald Trump and dog walking - and laughed, lots. Without realising it, the residents kept me going through a difficult job. I left Castlehill Care Home on 9 August. As I walked out the doors for the final time, one question repeated in my mind - surely they deserve better? A spokesperson for Castlehill Care Home, which trades under the name Simply Inverness, said: ""We are appalled by the footage aired in the BBC programme. ""It was not provided to us in advance and does not reflect the situation today. ""The safety, health and wellbeing of residents remains our absolute priority at all times. ""The Care Inspectorate has recognised the significant improvements made in the last three months. ""We must ensure that these improvements are sustained. ""In excess of £1m is being invested in the refurbishment of the home and we thank all residents and their families for their patience during the renovations."" A spokesperson for the Highland Health and Social Care Partnership said: ""The content of the BBC Disclosure documentary about Castlehill Care Home which highlighted issues about delivery of safe, quality care was concerning for all to see, and we understand how deeply distressing this will have been for families of those residents. ""We have a responsibility as a key partner with regards to support and protection of adults and we have clear expectations of standards to be met by any care home provider in Highland.

XFG, called Stratus by some, and NB.1.8.1, known as Nimbus, are now the most common variants being passed around in the UK, according to officials . Experts say these do not appear to pose any bigger threat than previous types of Covid or make people feel more ill. But recent genetic changes the virus has acquired may make infections more likely. Have you got a razor blade sore throat? It is usual for viruses to evolve as they spread between people over time. When the changes become significantly different, the new virus types are known as variants. According to some reports , there may be tell-tale symptoms with the latest ones - a hoarse voice or a ""razor blade"" sore throat. Covid can still cause a wide range of symptoms, including headache, coughing, a blocked or running nose and exhaustion, making it difficult to distinguish from a cold or flu. If you think you have Covid you should avoid contact with vulnerable people and stay at home if possible. If you have symptoms and need to leave the house, advice remains that you should wear a face covering. Washing hands regularly and using and disposing tissues in bins can reduce the spread of this and other respiratory illnesses. For a sore throat, drinking plenty of fluids and having a teaspoon of honey may help, the NHS says. According to the Royal College of GPs, rates of Covid are now increasing across the UK , especially in the very young and elderly. Hospital admissions linked to Covid are also going up. Can I still get a Covid test or vaccine? People over 75 can get a free vaccine against Covid on the NHS. This can offer good protection, even against the new variants, says the UK Health Security Agency  (UKHSA). It is urging people to book their vaccinations against flu and another common winter virus called RSV (respiratory syncytial virus) as cases start to increase ahead of winter. ""It's normal for viruses to mutate and change, and as more data becomes available on these variants,  we'll have a better understanding of how they interact with our immune systems and how to optimise our protection, as well as actions we can take to keep the most vulnerable safe and live our lives as normally as possible,"" says the UKHSA. ""The most important thing is for those eligible to get their vaccination when it is due."" Dr Alex Allen, Consultant Epidemiologist at UKHSA, added: ""Based on the available information so far, there is no evidence to suggest that the variants cause more severe disease or that the vaccines in current use will be less effective against them."" Bear in mind though it is possible to catch Covid again even if you have had it very recently, or have been vaccinated. Reinfections are usually mild, but you can feel unwell and still spread the virus to others. Covid tests are no longer widely available for free, but pharmacies still sell them. A number of High Street chemists and private clinics sell Covid vaccines too. The cost varies, with some charging around £99 for a single dose.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3rv3y9jnryo,Health,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/01e0/live/b42d7b30-9e05-11f0-b741-177e3e2c2fc7.jpg,2025-09-30T11:58:13.671000+00:00,3fd73a227af4e11776c18eeb8b3c607801dece67
460166ca2650,British veterans with hearing loss start legal battle over 'faulty' earplugs,,"British veterans with hearing loss start legal battle over 'faulty' earplugs Watch: Veterans speak to the BBC about the impact hearing loss has had on their lives Thousands of British military personnel have started legal action after being given ear protection they say was faulty and led to life-changing injuries such as tinnitus and deafness. The US industrial giant 3M supplied the Ministry of Defence (MoD) with the lightweight combat earplugs for use while training and on active service in Afghanistan and other countries. In 2023, the company agreed to pay out $6bn (£4.5bn) to settle similar claims from 240,000 US servicemen and women. 3M said that was not an admission of liability, its product worked effectively if used properly and it was prepared to defend itself in the English courts. Former Guardsman Dave Watson from Worcestershire remembers being given 3M earplugs while serving with the 1st Battalion Scots Guards from 2007, including on tour in Afghanistan. ""Anywhere outside of Camp Bastion we could have been using them, sometimes for up to 12 hours a day,"" he says. Mr Watson, 38, lost both legs and an arm in an explosion while on patrol in Helmand Province in May 2010, leading to his immediate medical discharge from the Army. He has since won five medals at the Invictus Games and now works as a motivational speaker and for veterans' charities. He says he first noticed something was wrong with his hearing around 18 months ago. ""I'd wake up in the early hours of the morning with a ringing in my ears, but I get it all through the day now,"" he says. ""I can't hear when my kids are calling me, I can't hear when my wife is calling me, so it's had a big impact on my family life."" Last month he went for tests and was told he would need hearing aids in the future, he says. Deafness and damage The combat earplugs v2 were reversable with the yellow end allowing some sounds through, and the green designed to block out more noise. Thousands of UK veterans and serving military personnel are now bringing a separate legal case against 3M for supplying what they say were faulty ear protectors between 2003 and at least 2015, when they were replaced by a new model. Its combat arms earplugs (version 2) were designed to be reversible, with one side blocking out most sounds, and the other protecting against impact sounds such as explosions while letting in spoken commands and other quieter noises. In 2018 the company paid $9.1m (£6.8m) to settle a lawsuit brought by the US Department of Justice which alleged the company knew the earplugs were too short and could ""loosen imperceptibly"". Five years later, in August 2023, it agreed to a $6bn (£4.5bn) settlement to resolve 240,000 civil cases being brought by US military veterans and those still serving. Around $2.75bn (£2bn) has been paid out to date, according to the Lawsuit Information Centre, but 3M has never accepted legal liability, arguing that its products were always ""safe and effective"" if used correctly. This week the first formal legal claim was launched in the UK with a ""letter before action"" sent to 3M on behalf of more than 2,000 veterans and current military personnel. ""As yet, there's been no justice and no compensation for British servicemen and women,"" says Tom Longstaff, a partner at KP Law, which is bringing the case. ""We've got very strong evidence that this product was defective, [and] that it suffered from a design flaw, which is well-documented in some of the cases that have already proceeded in the US."" A spokesman for 3M said the company had ""great respect"" for the British Armed Forces and it took the allegations concerning the product seriously. ""The resolution of previous litigation in the US did not involve any admission of liability and 3M is prepared to defend itself in any litigation threatened in the English courts,"" he said. Carole Timone Carol Timone served in Afghanistan with the British army in 2012 Carol Timone, 33, says she used the earplugs while serving in the British Army between 2008 and 2014, including in Afghanistan in 2012. The former lance bombardier says she's been left with hearing loss on one side from her time in the military and tinnitus which she describes as a ""horrific whining or pulsing that just won't go away"". ""I've seen veterans failed so many times, and this is just another blow to them, so I feel like something needs to be done, and someone really does need to be held accountable for it,"" she says. Earlier this month the Conservative MP Neil Shastri-Hurst called in parliament for an independent inquiry into the extent of hearing loss linked to the earplugs and other potentially defective equipment. The MoD declined to comment on the case against 3M but a spokesman said the government takes the health of its serving personnel seriously. ""We always look at how we can reduce noise levels in their working environment [and] provide training, protective equipment and regular hearing tests,"" he said. ""The Armed Forces Compensation Scheme [also] provides no-fault compensation to service personnel and veterans for injuries, illness and death caused by service.""

02f3f0765400,"'Buy one, get one free' deals for unhealthy food banned",,"'Buy one, get one free' deals for unhealthy food banned Nick Triggle Health correspondent AFP via Getty Images Price or multibuy promotions on unhealthy food and drink, such as ""buy one, get one free"" deals, are to be banned in England from Wednesday. The restrictions will apply to supermarkets, larger high street shops and online retailers. The measure has been under consideration for years but has been put off because of the cost-of-living crisis. Ministers argue the restrictions are an important step to tackle obesity – and in particular childhood obesity. The regulations also ban free refill promotions of certain drinks in restaurants and cafes. It will be followed by a ban on the advertising of less healthy food and drink on television before 21:00 and a complete ban on online promotions from January. A Department of Health and Social Care spokesman said the restrictions were a ""crucial step"" in giving children a healthy, happy start in life. ""Obesity robs children of the best possible start in life, sets them up for a lifetime of health problems and costs the NHS billions."" The government has introduced a classification system to define what food and drinks are classed as unhealthy, which is based on the products thought to have most influence on child obesity. So, in terms of drinks it includes fizzy drinks such as lemonade and cola that contain sugar. And for food it covers everything from crisps, sweets and chocolates to ice creams, pastries, cakes, and some fishfingers and pizzas. What difference will it make? Obesity rates have risen sharply over recent decades, with more than a quarter of adults and a fifth of children at the end of primary school classed as obese. Greg Fell, president of the Association of Public Health Directors, said this move should not be seen as a ""silver bullet"", but said it was long overdue, arguing it should not have been delayed from 2022 in the first place. ""Multi-buy promotions do not save people money – in fact, they encourage them to spend more. ""They are designed to encourage impulsive purchases and to normalise buying more and more frequently."" He said he hoped retailers would now turn towards promoting healthy products more, to make healthier choices easier and more accessible. Obesity rates had risen at an unprecedented rate over the years and were now a ""key driver"" of health inequalities as people in more deprived areas were nearly twice as likely to be obese, Mr Fell added. ""These are a long-overdue first step, but the government is far away from meeting its manifesto commitment to end junk food advertising to kids."" In particular he said there needed to be a tightening of restrictions on sponsorship of sporting and leisure events, as well as wider society investment to promote active travel and improve the quality of food in schools. There is evidence to suggest restrictions on the promotion and sale of unhealthy products can have an impact. A University of Leeds study published earlier this year looked at the impact of the one measure introduced in 2022 as planned – the ban on selling unhealthy products at key locations, such as checkouts, aisle ends and store entrances. Before the ban, 20 out of every 100 items sold were what was classed as unhealthy, while after that it dropped to 19. The researchers said this worked out at two million fewer products per day. Although it was also noted there was a downward trend for the sale of these products before the legislation was introduced and high rates of inflation could also have had an impact. There has been industry lobbying of government against the restrictions over the years. But some retailers, including Sainsbury's and Tesco, introduced their own restrictions some time ago. And Andrea Martinez-Inchausti, from the British Retail Consortium, said the vast majority of his members were already now compliant. ""There will not be a big change for them. ""Food retailers are supporting their customers to make healthier choices through better calorie labelling, reformulation of products, and portion control."" Wales is introducing similar restrictions next year and Scotland has said it will follow suit. Former prime minister Boris Johnson first announced a UK-wide ban on TV adverts for food high in sugar, salt and fat before 21:00 to help tackle the problem in 2021. The ban was later delayed to 2025, with the Conservative government saying it wanted to give the food and drink industry time to prepare for the change because of the cost of living crisis.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c89d54gv44qo,Health,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/d446/live/7365eac0-9e40-11f0-b0fc-395f3bc1ac43.jpg,2025-10-01T06:00:54.932000+00:00,ddadc3ba7ca1a0491aedec471bd261eee162b1b0
2e1001ccff88,Major failings found after surgeon harmed women,,"Major failings found after surgeon harmed women Facebook Daniel Hay was a consultant gynaecologist at the University Hospitals of Derby and Burton NHS Trust A former NHS gynaecologist's risky practices and shortcuts contributed to women suffering severe physical harm, a long-awaited report into his care has found. Daniel Hay joined the University Hospitals of Derby and Burton (UHDB) NHS Foundation Trust in 2005, and operated on hundreds of women before retiring in 2020. A report - which scrutinised Mr Hay's care between 2015 and 2018 - was commissioned after concerns were raised by colleagues, and found failings in his practices, how he was managed and added only ""good fortune prevented further harm"". After publication of the report on Wednesday, the NHS trust said it was ""truly sorry"" to the women who received care ""below the standards expected"". The report was commissioned by the Gynaecology Review Steering Group, which included representations from NHS England, UHDB, and the Derby and Derbyshire clinical commissioning group. As part of the report, the panel contacted 325 women who had been treated by Mr Hay between 2015 and 2018, asking them to share their experiences. In addition to the 325 patients, 58 women had already been reviewed in an earlier assessment carried out in 2019. In Wednesday's report, the steering group panel identified two women as suffering ""severe physical harm"", with three sustaining ""moderate physical harm"" under Mr Hay's care. Among the issues identified were women who had a hysterectomy - a surgical procedure that removes the womb - with some patients made to feel like it was their ""only option"" when less invasive options may have been available. This ""adversely affected"" the mental health of women who dreamed of starting families but were unable to do so, affecting their relationships and jobs. Mr Hay relinquished his medical licence in July 2021, having retired citing mental health concerns in July 2020 The report also found Mr Hay ""demonstrated poor clinical practice"", ""failed to recognise possible risks"", while the NHS trust that employed him ""somehow allowed this to continue until he eventually retired due to ill health"". His consent processes - in which patients should be able to make informed decisions over surgery - were poor, his record-keeping was inadequate, and his communication with patients was often dismissive, the report added. Concerns about Mr Hay were raised by consultants, theatre staff and managers as early as 2017-18, but the panel said it was ""surprised"" those staff members were not interviewed by the trust until 2022 - some five years later. What did Mr Hay's patients tell the review? The report published multiple testimonies from women, who were not named. They described being rushed into having hysterectomies. One woman was being treated by Mr Hay for heavy menstrual bleeding, and was offered a hysterectomy after a 10-minute consultation with no scan or alternatives discussed, the report said. She said the surgery left her in pain, suffering anxiety and depression Another woman felt she was not given any option other than to have a hysterectomy - even though there was no examination or scan investigation. She said: ""Was such a drastic major operation the only option I had?"" One woman found Mr Hay to be ""erratic"". She told the panel: ""I remember Mr Hay asking, 'what do you want?' 'I just want the bleeding to stop' was my reply. He immediately got his diary out and told me 'you can have a hysterectomy in April' One patient asked why she had to have an open hysterectomy, rather than via a keyhole approach, and was astounded when Mr Hay answered ""I like slicing"", the report said Meanwhile, another patient added: ""I will never set foot in an NHS hospital again. If my leg were hanging off, I would amputate it myself."" PA Media Following publication of the report, the trust said it had already made ""important changes"" Of the 325 women whose care was scrutinised, the panel graded each case red - for major concerns - amber for some concerns, or green - in which none were identified. In total, 48 cases were rated red, 68 amber and 209 green, though the review did not define the exact nature of the concerns. The panel found it was only because of ""the support of good colleagues"" and good fortune"" that further harm was prevented from being caused. Mr Hay, who is in his 60s and from Alfreton in Derbyshire, is currently being investigated by Derbyshire Police and was interviewed under caution earlier this year . He spoke to officers about the procedures he carried out at Royal Derby Hospital and Ripley Hospital. A police spokesperson said: ""Due to the complex nature of the case, inquiries have taken time, however, throughout the investigation we have remained in close contact with those affected and will continue to do so as the investigation continues."" Mr Hay has not officially commented on the matter for more than four years. His statement in July 2021 said: ""I apologise to the women affected by the NHS investigation. I am co-operating with the investigation, however, due to my ongoing mental health issues, I ask that you please respect my privacy at this time."" The Medical Defence Union, on Mr Hay's behalf, did not wish to comment when approached by the BBC. Following the report, a series of recommendations were made to the trust, including introducing measures to ""identify poorly performing clinicians"", that no consultant should work in isolation, and that attending multidisciplinary team meetings should be mandatory for clinicians. It also called on the trust to invest in more gynaecological support for women under its care. Another recommendation was for the trust to review Mr Hay's care of women before 2015, which has now been accepted with the aim of starting in the autumn. Once ready, the trust will contact women who fall within the scope of the ""Phase 2"" review to invite them to take part. 'Important changes' A second report, which reviewed governance at the UHDB trust at the time, was published alongside the major review into Mr Hay's care. It said Mr Hay's care from 2012 should also be reviewed. Dr Gis Robinson, executive chief medical officer at the NHS trust, said: ""We want to reiterate our unreserved apologies to the women who received care from Mr Hay that was far below the standards expected. ""Following the report we made important changes, with clearer consent procedures and enhanced clinical oversight so any issues with care can be identified more quickly, and improved post-procedure reviews for women. ""We will continue to closely monitor and review these to ensure they are effective and fully integrated, and use our learning to support and inform the next stage of the review."" Getty Images A number of women said they felt as though they had ""no other option"" than to have a hysterectomy Analysis By Rob Sissons, East Midlands health correspondent The report is full of numbers but, of course, behind the numbers are the real lives of women who say their relationships have been ruined through poor care. I have spoken to two women involved in the review who, to some extent, blame themselves for going along with what Mr Hay said. Both felt dismissed and not listened to, but of course, they put their trust in a surgeon in one of the most personal and sensitive areas of medicine, gynaecology. In large organisations - the NHS is the country's biggest employer - things will go wrong, but the question is always are the systems and processes in place robust enough to pick up poor performance, and do management do enough when problems are exposed and colleagues speak out? In the Hay case, it is now apparent more could and should have been done. More cases are now going to be reviewed.

0ccd803fb0f2,Scientists make embryos from human skin DNA for first time,,"Scientists make embryos from human skin DNA for first time James Gallagher Health and science correspondent OHSU/Christine Torres Hicks US scientists have, for the first time, made early-stage human embryos by manipulating DNA taken from people's skin cells and then fertilising it with sperm. The technique could overcome infertility due to old age or disease, by using almost any cell in the body as the starting point for life. It could even allow same-sex couples to have a genetically related child. The method requires significant refinement - which could take a decade - before a fertility clinic could even consider using it. Experts said it was an impressive breakthrough, but there needed to be an open discussion with the public about what science was making possible. Reproduction used to be a simple story of man's sperm meets woman's egg. They fuse to make an embryo, and nine months later a baby is born. Now scientists are changing the rules. This latest experiment starts with human skin. The Oregon Health and Science University research team's technique takes the nucleus – which houses a copy of the entire genetic code needed to build the body – out of a skin cell. This is then placed inside a donor egg that has been stripped of its genetic instructions. So far, the technique is like the one used to create Dolly the Sheep – the world's first cloned mammal – born back in 1996. OHSU The big circle is the egg viewed under a microscope, the white dot at the bottom is the genetic material taken from a skin cell and placed inside However, this egg is not ready to be fertilised by sperm as it already contains a full suite of chromosomes. You inherit 23 of these bundles of DNA from each of your parents for a total of 46, which the egg already has. So the next stage is to persuade the egg to discard half of its chromosomes in a process the researchers have termed ""mitomeiosis"" (the word is a fusion of mitosis and meiosis, the two ways cells divide). An explanation of how the new technique works The study, published in the journal Nature Communications , showed 82 functional eggs were made. These were fertilised with sperm and some progressed onto the early stages of embryos development. None were developed beyond the six-day-stage. ""We achieved something that was thought to be impossible,"" said Prof Shoukhrat Mitalipov, the director of the Oregon Health and Science University's centre for embryonic cell and gene therapy. The technique is far from polished as the egg randomly chooses which chromosomes to discard. It needs to end up with one of each of the 23 types to prevent disease, but ends up with two of some and none of others. There is also a poor success rate (around 9%) and the chromosomes miss an important process where they rearrange their DNA, called crossing over. Prof Mitalipov, a world-renowned pioneer in the field, told me: ""We have to perfect it. ""Eventually, I think that's where the future will go because there are more and more patients that cannot have children."" OHSU/Christine Torres Hicks Prof Shoukhrat Mitalipov This technology is part of a growing field aiming to make sperm and eggs outside of the body, known as in vitro gametogenesis. The approach is still at the level of scientific discovery rather than clinical use, but the vision is to help couples who cannot benefit from IVF (in vitro fertilisation) because they don't have the sperm or eggs to use. It could help older women who no longer have viable eggs, men who don't produce enough sperm or people whose cancer treatment has left them infertile. The field also re-writes the rules of parenthood. The technique described today does not have to use a woman's skin cells - it could also use a man's. That opens the door to same-sex couples having children that are genetically related to both partners. For example, in a male same-sex couple, one man's skin could be used to make the egg and a male partner's sperm used to fertilise it. ""In addition to offering hope for millions of people with infertility due to lack of eggs or sperm, this method would allow for the possibility of same-sex couples to have a child genetically related to both partners,"" said Prof Paula Amato, from Oregon Health and Science University. Build public trust Roger Sturmey, a professor of reproductive medicine at the University of Hull, said the science was ""important"" and ""impressive"". He added: ""At the same time, such research reinforces the importance of continued open dialogue with the public about new advances in reproductive research. ""Breakthroughs such as this impress upon us the need for robust governance, to ensure accountability and build public trust."" Prof Richard Anderson, deputy director of MRC Centre for reproductive health at the University of Edinburgh, said the ability to generate new eggs ""would be a major advance"". He said: ""There will be very important safety concerns but this study is a step towards helping many women have their own genetic children.""",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4g2vyee0zlo,Health,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/19ca/live/e7051760-9dd9-11f0-9f23-2534d63ace40.jpg,2025-09-30T15:01:42.344000+00:00,8a86e184e35036c8961e887dd36cc2435d4133ab
d9523a1e16ff,Streeting rules out VAT on private healthcare,,"Streeting rules out VAT on private healthcare Joshua Nevett Political reporter PA Media Wes Streeting has ruled out introducing value added tax (VAT) on private healthcare at the forthcoming Budget. It comes after newspaper reports that the Treasury was looking at bringing private healthcare services within scope of the sales tax. But asked whether this was under consideration, the health secretary told BBC Breakfast: ""it's not happening"". It comes as Chancellor Rachel Reeves faces repeated questions about the prospect of tax rises, including VAT, when she delivers her budget in November. Economists have said taxes will have to go up in the autumn Budget if the chancellor is to meet her self-imposed rules on borrowing to fund public services. In her Labour conference speech on Monday, Reeves said the government was facing difficult choices and promised she would not take risks with the public finances. The chancellor pledged to keep ""taxes, inflation and interest rates as low as possible"". But hinting at further tax rises, she said the government's choices had been made ""harder"" by international events and the ""long-term damage"" done to the economy. Labour pledged in its election manifesto not to raise VAT, along with National Insurance, or the basic, higher, or additional rates of income tax. But newspaper reports have suggested officials at the Treasury are examining broadening the scope of VAT to help raise further revenue. VAT is levied at a standard rate of 20% on most goods and services in the UK, unless they are classed as reduced or zero-rated. Most private healthcare services are currently exempt from VAT, apart from some procedures which are classified as being primarily cosmetic. Private school fees were also previously exempt, but the government introduced VAT on school fees in January, estimating it could raise £1.7bn a year by 2029/30. In an interview ahead of her conference speech, Reeves was asked if VAT could rise and she said: ""The manifesto commitments stand."" That form of words has been echoed by senior ministers at Labour's conference, including Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer. But when pressed over whether she would have to put up taxes, Reeves said ""the world has changed"" in the last year - pointing to wars in Europe and the Middle East, US tariffs and the global cost of borrowing. ""We're not immune to any of those things,"" she added. Former Labour leader Neil Kinnock has called for Reeves to put VAT on private healthcare to raise money for the NHS. The Labour peer told the i newspaper removing the VAT exemption on private healthcare would provide ""vital funding"" for public services and be ""widely supported"" by the public. The policy is supported by the Good Growth Foundation think tank, which estimates putting VAT on private acute healthcare could raise more than £2bn. The high cost of long-term government borrowing and weak economic growth has fuelled speculation the chancellor will need to increase taxes. Last month, an independent think tank, the National Institute of Economic and Social Research (Niesr), estimated that the chancellor would need to plug a £50bn gap in the public finances. But the chancellor played down the figure and criticised such forecasters, saying ""a lot of them are talking rubbish"".",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0knr2dmn4mo,Health,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/d9c1/live/76de5a00-9dcf-11f0-9f23-2534d63ace40.jpg,2025-09-30T07:53:57.183000+00:00,ca206a56129dd435f72a08b0c95a720e20ff4e29

Researchers posing as beauticians secretly filmed a nurse trading prescriptions over WhatsApp, a pharmacist coaching clients to falsify records and a bogus doctor handing over Korean toxin vials for cash. Medical rules require an in-person consultation and prescription to check Botox is suitable. Skipping these safeguards raises the risk of complications such as drooping eyelids, headaches or, in rare cases, respiratory failure or death. The pharmacists' regulator said it was ""very concerned"" while the nurses' regulator said it would review the evidence. Watch: BBC confronts fake doctor selling unlicensed Korean toxins Botulinum toxin - commonly known by the brand name Botox - is also sold under several other licensed brands in the UK, including Azzalure, Bocouture and Dysport. According to market analysts Precision Business Insights, the UK botulinum toxin market was worth about £115m in 2024 and is forecast to reach nearly £295m by 2031. Botox is a prescription-only medicine, and while many people now receive injections from high-street beauticians, the law requires a doctor, dentist, nurse prescriber or pharmacist prescriber to first examine the patient in person and issue a prescription confirming it is safe to proceed. Over several months, BBC researchers gathered evidence of trusted medical professionals sidestepping the rules. Secret recording captured transactions from high-street clinics to online sellers, revealing how unsafe and illegal practices have spread across England's booming aesthetics market. 'Same old crap' Nurse prescriber Sally Jackson was filmed offering to sell Botox prescriptions over WhatsApp without ever seeing patients In a café in Christchurch, Dorset, our undercover researcher posed as a beautician seeking prescriptions and the Botox stock needed to inject clients at a new beauty clinic. Across the table sat Poole-based senior nurse prescriber Sally Jackson, who ran a business supplying beauticians in this way. As a prescriber, she was required under professional rules to meet and examine each patient in person before issuing a prescription, the document that allows beauticians on the high street to inject. Ms Jackson acknowledged those rules but then brushed them aside. ""I'm supposed to do a face-to-face consultation. But we can do it the other way, WhatsApp me,"" she said. When pressed on whether she should speak to clients who would be her patients, to whom she owed a duty of care, she was blunter still. ""I should talk to them, but I won't,"" she admitted, dismissing the checks as ""same old crap"". For £30, she issued a prescription, later obtained by the BBC from the pharmacy she directed, for a patient she had never met, whose details were sent to her on WhatsApp. Once a private practitioner in London's exclusive Harley Street, Ms Jackson was now selling shortcuts to beauticians nationwide, telling our researcher: ""I'm so busy."" She also offered to prescribe extra vials on a genuine patient's script - allowing beauticians to keep stock for clients and then inject them secretly, with no prescription in place. Prescribing a drug in one person's name for use on another constitutes fraud. Ms Jackson ignored repeated requests for comment. When confronted in person, she replied: ""I am not interested."" Patients have reported harm after Botox injections - the BBC investigation found rules designed to prevent such injuries were being bypassed by registered medical professionals ""Botox is safe when used properly - but the checks exist for a reason,"" said Cheryl Barton, lead nurse at the Aesthetika clinic near Sheffield, who often gives expert evidence in malpractice cases. ""The truth is that shortcuts by registered and regulated medical professionals who should know better are an open secret in the industry. Prescribers are supposed to see patients face to face and issue a valid prescription - but too often they don't."" Without those safeguards, explained Barton, prescribers can miss vital conditions that make treatment unsafe, or channel counterfeit and unlicensed products on to the market. Misuse of botulinum toxin can cause serious harm - from headaches and blurred vision to, in rare cases, respiratory failure or even death. Official figures back up her concerns. The UK medicines regulator recorded 52 suspected Botox-related complications in 2019, rising to 225 in 2024, with 141 already logged this year. Since 2015, 12 deaths have been recorded. For patients such as Antonia Hannah, from Twickenham, west London, the impact can be devastating. She booked Botox as a birthday treat, but the qualified practitioner gave her no proper consultation, asked no questions about her medical history and failed to assess whether the treatment was suitable. Within days her eyelid had drooped and swelled. ""It was constant discomfort and pain, like glass in your eyes,"" she said. ""I'd be out shopping with my daughter, glance in a mirror, and just burst into tears."" 'You're going to do it illegally' Pharmacist Cornelius Agoye was filmed in his Rainham pharmacy handing over Botox for cash In east London, pharmacist prescriber Cornelius Agoye was also willing to prescribe without any consultation, handing over vials of Botox for cash with no patient in sight. He met a second undercover researcher, posing as a beautician wanting prescriptions and stock for clients, and to cover his tracks told us to fill in records as if a consultation had taken place: ""I did face-to-face consultation today… I've just done it,"" he said. He then explained to us the same fraudulent practice of using prescriptions for one patient to obtain extra stock to be used on others. Asked about the legality of this, his answer was blunt: ""Yeah, you're going to do it illegally… That's what you're doing. I didn't tell you anything."" The BBC wrote to Mr Agoye, a registered and trusted community pharmacist, seeking an explanation for his behaviour. He apologised and admitted falling below professional standards and said he meant no harm. These Botox vials were supplied illegally by pharmacist Cornelius Agoye, who told an undercover reporter to falsify records and use the medicine without prescriptions for patients Earlier this year, a sudden outbreak of botulism across England left dozens of young women in hospital, some partially paralysed, after being injected with black-market Korean toxin sold by beauticians as a Botox-style treatment. It highlighted the dangers of unlicensed products — and led the BBC to investigate those behind the trade in London. The team uncovered a bogus doctor selling unlicensed Botox. In north London, Prakash Gurnani — who runs Beauty Aesthetics and Wellbeing in Golders Green — introduced himself to our undercover researcher as a ""skin doctor"". In reality he is not a doctor at all, and misleading clients in this way is a criminal offence. When asked about Botox, he immediately offered a cheaper Korean alternative. The Korean vials were unlicensed botulinum toxin products, marketed as having the same wrinkle-smoothing effect. They're potentially dangerous because they aren't regulated or tested in the UK, so their contents and safety, or whether they are counterfeit, are unknown. He sold a vial for £149, with no prescription and no safeguards, and admitted he had been trading unlicensed products for years across the UK including throughout the Covid period. 'They are young girls and there's no problem' Prakash Gurnani, who illegally calls himself a ""skin doctor"", was filmed taking cash while supplying unlicensed Korean toxins Mr Gurnani described holding Botox parties where groups of young women were injected with the same illegal Korean toxin. He told our researcher to hide what was really being injected. ""Just say 'tox',"" he instructed. ""Don't use 'Botox', just say 'anti-wrinkle'. Keep it quiet. They are young girls and there's no problem - just treat them with Korean tox."" When asked about the risks by the researcher, he brushed them aside. ""Very safe. As long as they don't open their mouth,"" he said, referring not to any medical issue, but to the risk of being caught. A vial of unlicensed Korean botulinum toxin sold to the BBC by Prakash Gurnani. Unlike licensed Botox, it has not been safety checked and is not traceable His activities stretched beyond Botox. He also sold the BBC powerful prescription-only weight-loss drugs such as Mounjaro, despite not being qualified to prescribe them, and even suggested injecting one of our reporters with an illegally obtained anaesthetic as part of a cosmetic procedure. The BBC had only given him the scantest of details, and a pharmacy which issued the prescription and supplied the weight loss drugs said he had tricked them by posing as a doctor — a claim Mr Gurnani later disputed. Mr Gurnani ignored all requests for comment, and when confronted by the BBC denied offering Botox illegally or asking clients to break the law. Prakash Gurnani was secretly recorded explaining how to hide the use of unlicensed Korean toxin and mislead young women about what they were being injected with The cases of Sally Jackson, Cornelius Agoye and Prakash Gurnani were not isolated. The BBC received reports from other parts of England of registered medical professionals breaking the rules, and some of them spoke directly to our undercover researcher. One pharmacist also admitted he was not carrying out the required face-to-face consultations and suggested faking photographs to trick regulators into thinking they had taken place. Another nurse was found issuing prescriptions on the basis of the barest patient details, and, after the Nursing and Midwifery Council (NMC) tightened its guidelines in June, admitted she was prepared to ""be a bit greyer"" and carry on without proper consultations. Medical experts told the BBC such practices stripped away the most basic safeguards and put large numbers of patients at risk. Beyond those caught on camera, the BBC uncovered extensive evidence of other nurses and pharmacists supplying Botox illegally The BBC wrote to the NMC, which regulates nurses across the UK. It said prescribers must see patients face to face before issuing prescriptions for cosmetic procedures, and promised to review the evidence from this investigation and act on breaches. The BBC also approached the General Pharmaceutical Council. It said it was ""very concerned"" by the findings, stressing that Botox prescriptions always require a physical examination and that enforcement action would follow where standards were not met. The BBC further asked the Department of Health and Social Care about the issues raised. It said the cosmetics industry had long been plagued by unlicensed practitioners and confirmed the government was assessing reforms, including tougher licensing of non-medical professionals such as beauticians. But when repeatedly asked about the central finding of this investigation - that trusted medical professionals are themselves breaking the rules and putting patients at risk - the department did not offer a response and declined an interview with Health Secretary Wes Streeting.

55714e7aeee1,New inquests open into jailed surgeon's patients,,"A further two inquests have been opened into the deaths of former patients of jailed surgeon Ian Paterson. Judge Richard Foster opened the inquests of Pauline Brown, who died aged 62, and Jennifer Fox, who died aged 47, at Birmingham Coroners' Court on Tuesday. There are now 65 inquests ongoing into the deaths of patients of Ian Paterson, who was convicted of wounding patients with botched and unnecessary operations in 2017 and sentenced to 20 years in prison. Mr Foster said: ""I have reason to believe Mrs Brown and Ms Fox's deaths were caused by or contributed to by substandard care provided by Ian Paterson and have reason to suspect their deaths were unnatural."" The court heard that next of kin had been traced for both women but they were not present at the opening on Tuesday. Pauline Margaret Brown - maiden name Doyle - was born in Birmingham and lived in Water Orton, Warwickshire. A retired dressmaker, she was married to a former service engineer. She died on 9 June 2006 at George Elliot Hospital in Nuneaton, with her cause of death recorded as metastatic carcinoma of the breast. Jennifer Alison Fox was born in Cardiff but lived in Birmingham and had worked as bar staff. She died on 22 August 2012 at the Velindre Cancer Centre in Cardiff. Her cause of death was recorded as metastatic breast cancer. After both inquests were opened and then adjourned to a later day, Judge Foster offered his condolences to both families and said he understood the inquests might cause further distress, which he would try to minimise. ""But it is only right a full investigation takes place,"" he said. Ian Paterson worked for both Heart of England NHS Trust and private practice at Heartlands Hospital, Solihull Hospital, Good Hope Hospital, Spire Hospital Parkway and Spire Hospital Little Aston.""

5e3e7c1d8e11,Collagen: Do you drink it? Inject it? Rub it on your skin? And does it work?,,"Collagen: Do you drink it? Inject it? Rub it on your skin? And does it work? Ruth Clegg Health and wellbeing reporter Getty Images When it comes to collagen - how do you take yours? There are parties where people even drink shots of the anti-ageing supplement, often followed by a hefty tequila - though the latter is probably not recommended in the quest for youthful, peachy skin. Collagen is the most abundant protein in the body, and forms the scaffolding that helps maintain the structural integrity of our skin and musculoskeletal system. In short, collagen helps to keep our skin plump, our joints and bones strong, and our hair and nails healthy. It's become so treasured that some dermatologists recommend ""banking"" it - investing in our collagen supply early so we have surplus when the inevitable happens. Yes. The inevitable. Ageing. Sigh. Our collagen supply naturally starts to decrease, on average around 1% a year, as we reach our mid to late 20s . The speed of its decline depends on factors like our exposure to the sun, diet, and stress levels. But is there credible science to say supplements can replenish our dwindling supply? And if so, what's the best way of getting it into our bodies? Kimberlie Smith As a sleep deprived mother, Kimberlie says collagen makes a difference to her skin Kimberlie Smith started taking collagen about six months ago. The 33-year-old began using it after a ""traumatic year"" in 2024. Her son was born prematurely, and as a result of stress, the mother-of-three says her skin took a ""huge hit"". She uses marine collagen, the type derived from fish, in a tropical-flavoured gel she drinks every day. ""My skin definitely seems to be brighter and clearer, plus my hair has never looked better since I started taking it,"" Kimberlie says. ""As a sleep deprived mother, it's definitely made a difference."" Emma Wedgeworth, a consultant dermatologist based on London's Harley Street, says while there is some research to suggest taking collagen orally has an impact , she remains sceptical. She says the idea that collagen can make its journey through our body - not the easiest of quests - and land exactly where we need it to be is probably wishful thinking. For a start, it has to get through the gut without being completely broken down. Collagen is a large molecule so companies have now started to break it up into smaller pieces - collagen peptides - otherwise known as hydrolysed collagen. Even though this collagen - now in its smaller form - has a better chance of making its way through the intestinal wall and into the bloodstream, it still has a long way to go. It has to reach the skin to have an impact, and it could just as easily slip off to support other organs in the body. It's a valuable resource. ""There is little reliable evidence on this, but there is a theory that because our skin is the organ with the 'fastest turnover' of cells, it might be more likely to use these collagen peptides above other organs."" And that's when you might get an increase in collagen being made in the skin cells. 'You can't risk stopping' That all seems very complicated - and uncertain. It may leave you asking: what about using collagen creams? They're going directly onto the skin, so won't they stand more chance of getting where they need to be? ""No,"" is Ms Wedgworth's simple answer. ""The collagen will just sit on the outer layer of your skin, it won't reach the dermis - which is the middle layer."" There are three different types of collagen supplements: marine (from fish), bovine (from cows), and vegan. Of the three, the dermatologist recommends marine if you are taking collagen orally. This is because it contains more type 1 collagen - the most common of the five types and the one that gives structure to our skin cells, as well as playing a crucial role in the health of our bones, tendons and connective tissues. Vegan collagen is the least effective, says Ms Wedgeworth. Collagen is an animal-derived protein, so these products are not actually made of collagen, and instead contain a range of amino acids and vitamins. Matthew Montgomery Ali Watson, a keen weightlifter, originally started to use collagen supplements to help protect her joints ""I'm trapped,"" Ali Watson tells me as she points to packs of bovine collagen powder in her kitchen. ""Yes, this one is for me and well, this one is for Tommy."" I look at the slender brown hound next me, grey whiskers poking out round his nose. He lifts an eyebrow in acknowledgement. Ali, a neuroanaesthetist who, by her own admission, ""knows a lot about dosing"", feels like now she's started taking collagen, she can't stop - and nor can she stop giving it to her dog. ""I started taking it as a powder a couple of years ago. At first, it wasn't about my appearance, it was about my joints, I wanted to protect them because I do a lot of weight-lifting."" Ali's not sure that she's noticed any difference with her joints, but she has noticed a change elsewhere. ""My skin feels like it glows more, my hair feels thicker and my nails feel stronger."" I glance down at Tommy, who seems more interested in his dog bowl than any powdered supplements. ""I know, it seems mad,"" Ali says, ""but Tommy seemed a bit slower, a bit less enthusiastic just before summer, so I thought I would try him on dog collagen. ""I wanted to see if it could help with his joints - he's getting old now. And he is a bit brighter, but that might just be because the weather's got colder again and he's less hot and lethargic."" Ali's not completely convinced the supplement is making a difference, and it's costing her £60 a month to ensure she and Tommy get their daily dose. Tommy started on collagen a few months ago to help his joints But she says she now can't stop. ""That's the thing with these supplements,"" the 46-year-old says, ""life does have its ups and downs. You might take them when you're on a down, then things pick up again - and it might have very little to do with the supplements. ""But by that stage, you can't risk stopping."" Professor Faisal Ali, a consultant dermatologist at Mid Cheshire NHS Trust, says one of the issues consumers and clinicians face is the amount of conflicting information and conflicting interests in supplement research. A recent, relatively small, study compared research funded by the wellness industry to studies that did not have the same conflict of interest. While industry-funded studies suggested collagen supplements significantly improved skin hydration, elasticity and wrinkles, those that did not receive funding from pharmaceutical companies revealed no effect on skin. Prof Ali says industry-funded studies are not ""inherently bad"", it's just such a varied picture. But he says there is a lack of robust evidence to suggest oral and topical collagen have any substantial effect. So if I could turn back time and start drinking and banking collagen in my 20s, would I have smoother, more youthful skin now, I ask him? Probably not, he says. It doesn't stay in the body for that long - we haven't got a collagen store cupboard that we can just dip into. Getty Images Microneedling makes small wounds in the skin which may trigger collagen production However, Prof Ali believes we can potentially boost collagen output and maintain elasticity in our skin by using special techniques such as laser collagen stimulation and microneedling . This means using a number of tiny, specialist needles or a laser to make small wounds to our skin, which then encourage a repair process, triggering new collagen formation. But that's not cheap. You could be paying up to £300 for one session. Is there a less costly alternative? ""The best thing you can do for your skin,"" Prof Ali says, ""is using decent sunblock. We know the sun has a huge impact on ageing our skin. ""Sun cream, healthy diet, and if you smoke, stop. ""These will have a far greater impact than collagen supplements.""",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cjr5zj12ye1o,Health,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/0049/live/861c7ea0-9c4b-11f0-928c-71dbb8619e94.jpg,2025-09-27T22:37:43.699000+00:00,b80af8851b34b69e7d1fecf440d218b428140a8d
4851f30d3ea6,Doctors' union warning over online booking safety risk,,"Doctors' union warning over online booking safety risk Getty Images There are concerns the new online system will not be able to differentiate between urgent and non-urgent requests The doctors union, the British Medical Association (BMA), has warned that potentially serious health problems could be missed by GPs, and lead to patients being harmed, when a new online booking system is launched across England on Wednesday. But Health Secretary Wes Streeting says ministers are putting the interests of patients first and had already agreed clear safeguards with the union. The system will allow patients wanting an on-the-day GP appointment, or a call from a clinician, to make a request online throughout the day. The facility is already available in many practices and is designed to reduce long waits on the phone during the so-called '8am scramble'. 'Online tsunami' The BMA says the government must halt the rollout of the online booking plan to allow changes to be put in place. The union argues that online systems cannot distinguish adequately between urgent and non-urgent patient messages, and this could lead to potentially serious cases being delayed. The BMA has also warned there would be a ""potential online triage tsunami"" with no additional workforce to cope with the extra demand. Union leaders say more should be done to provide safeguards, such as allowing practices to temporarily switch off the online booking mechanism if staff are struggling to handle patient numbers. The union has warned that if the government does not amend the scheme, a formal dispute will be declared. This could lead to a ""work to rule"" situation, similar to what was introduced in a previous dispute during which GPs limited patient appointments to the minimum required under their contract. 'NHS should not be held back' But ministers argue that the BMA had agreed to the introduction of online booking as part of a new negotiated contract in England. They point out that many GPs already offer the service. Wes Streeting, Secretary of State for Health and Social Care, said it was ""absurd"" that in 2025 many patients can't request appointments online. ""If you can book a hair appointment online, you should be able to book an NHS appointment too. We have agreed clear safeguards, where patients will be directed to phone up or attend in person for urgent appointments. The BMA knows this. This government will always put the interests of patients first, and we will not stand for our NHS being held back in the analogue age."" Dr Katie Bramall-Stainer, chair of the BMA GP committee, said the changes were agreed to ""on the condition that 'necessary safeguards' would be put in place"" before Wednesday 1 October. ""This was agreed – in writing – with government… and NHSE in February this year. Now almost eight months later, it is deeply disappointing to see promises broken,"" she added. She said ministers had been warned that the changes would lead to ""hospital-style waiting lists in general practice"" which could ""reduce face-to-face GP appointments"". Mr Streeting said that that 2,000 extra GPs had already been hired across England and that patient satisfaction with their GPs was on the up. Officials said that surgeries which had implemented the changes had reported reduced waiting times for appointments.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cqje8dljz7eo,Health,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/abde/live/2bea5880-9dc2-11f0-b741-177e3e2c2fc7.jpg,2025-09-29T11:35:28.974000+00:00,91e37fa48eb53c9dbced4a1271b15c7ba45a1404
cbc928f4095f,'My baby's brain tumour symptoms were dismissed as colic',,"'My baby's brain tumour symptoms were dismissed as colic' Antonia Matthews and Danielle Herbert BBC Wales Corinne Wardle Molly had nine hours of surgery, aged just 12 weeks, when the tumour was finally discovered A mum whose baby daughter was diagnosed with a brain tumour, after her symptoms were dismissed as colic and reflux for more than two months, is calling for better awareness of the condition. Newborn Molly appeared unsettled, and aged three weeks had three seizures, said mum Corinne Wardle, a community nurse in Flintshire and Wrexham. At eight weeks, Molly's head was bigger than normal, she was unsettled and vomiting frequently, and her eyes would only look right - but the symptoms were dismissed by a paediatrician. But after noticing that Molly's fontanelle - the soft spot on the top of her head - was bulging when she was 12 weeks, a doctor in A&E diagnosed a large brain tumour. ""Her eyes were going in opposite corners and her head suddenly got massive,"" said Corinne, from Flint, speaking more than two years on from the initial surgery. Back at the hospital emergency department, the mum and baby were about to be sent home by staff after being told there was an eight-hour wait. But when another 10-day-old baby came in with a seizure, a doctor was called - he subsequently examined Molly and rushed her straight through. He measured her head and it was ""off the chart"", said Corinne, so the doctor sent her in for a CT scan. ""He wouldn't leave her side. He was fantastic,"" she said. Corinne Wardle Molly relapsed in January this year and had surgery in February The results came through instantly, and Corinne was told Molly had a large mass on her brain. She was sent straight to Alder Hey Children's Hospital, in Liverpool, where she underwent nine hours of surgery the following morning to remove the tumour Baby Molly then had a year of chemotherapy, and took five different types of chemotherapy drugs as part of a clinical trial. One of the  trialled drugs caused her to stop breathing, and she had be put on a ventilator. Molly has suffered hearing loss and global developmental delay - when a child takes longer than expected to reach key developmental milestones such as speaking and walking - as a result of the treatment. She was in remission for two years, but in January this year, two further tumours were found, and she had more surgery. The plan was to follow up with radiotherapy, but because the tumour was half the size of Molly's brain this risks significant cognitive impairment, Corinne said. She told BBC Radio Wales Breakfast : ""She would be disabled for life, always needing support. ""She won't be able to do things like cross the road by herself or use money."" Because of this, the family are holding off on the radiotherapy, and Molly is having three-monthly MRI scans under general anaesthetic as they watch and wait. Corinne Wardle Molly has undergone several complex operations and is now being monitored Hugh Adams, from Brain Tumour Research, said Molly's case was ""uniquely challenging"", adding faster diagnosis was ""something we have to strive for"". He described the interventions and surgery necessary for Molly's survival as ""really tough"", particularly for such young children, pointing out they also carry additional risks. ""Radiotherapy on a developing brain is a really tough option,"" he said - and he highlighted how chemotherapy impacts the entire body before it reaches the brain. He called for more money to be put into research on brain tumours, to hasten research into alternative treatments for the condition. ""We need to be looking at some of the newer things - maybe vaccines, maybe immunotherapy: things that are at the cutting edge of cancer treatment... so that people aren't impaired by their treatment as much as they are by the actual tumour itself,"" he said. He told BBC Radio Wales: ""If we put money into research, we get closure to new cures and options - if we don't, we won't. ""Historically we've put 1% of the national cancer research spending into brain tumours. That isn't enough.""",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cm2z5py6l12o,Health,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/9ef8/live/3fde3150-9dd0-11f0-9f23-2534d63ace40.jpg,2025-09-30T09:52:59.351000+00:00,385c96dcec4d0e6013726f3c5eed4a5d6162ec02
2616da008e15,Can England's rugby heroes inspire more girls to stay in sport?,,"Can England's rugby heroes inspire more girls to stay in sport? Nicola Goodwin BBC Midlands Investigations BBC Sports groups in England are hoping to use the success of the England Women's team to keep youngsters, like these in Worcester, playing their sport A million teenage girls are giving up sport because of deep-rooted negative attitudes - but could the England Women's Rugby World Cup victory change that? I arrive at a sports hall as a group of 11 and 12-year-old girls play netball and laughter is ringing out. Their PE teacher, Liz Brown, says she is passionate about boosting their confidence through games like this and exercise. ""Sport and PE is the vehicle. My real job is to create personalities, confidence and resilience,"" she tells me. As they move the ball around, shoot and practice, the students tell me that playing sport is helping with their mental as well as physical health. One of them, Ellie-May, says: ""It makes me feel happy and it's enjoyable."" These are the kind of teenage girls which a new campaign is targeting, with the hope that England's success in the Women's Rugby World Cup will help stop them dropping out of sport. Research by the charity Women in Sport discovered that a million teenage girls, who enjoyed games at primary school, gave them up after moving on. A fear of feeling judged by others, a lack of confidence and not feeling safe outside were among the negative attitudes behind the decline, cited by the study. Mollie, Ellie-May and Trisha said playing sport made them happy Back at the sports hall, at Perton Middle School in Staffordshire, near Wolverhampton, Ms Brown says she feels girls want to be part of sport. ""They want to be part of a community, they want to get out there and enjoy themselves,"" she tells me. ""If these girls can see it on TV and social media, they understand and they follow, and they will enjoy it."" Among the girls, Valentina and Kiara say: ""It doesn't really matter if you're not good at it because you can always get extra help."" PE teacher Liz Brown said seeing women's sport on TV had inspired her students Ahead of the World Cup, the Red Roses launched a campaign called For the Girls aimed at inspiring women and girls to be more active and confident. ""The social media, the World Cup TV coverage, the TikTok dances and all of that is having a major impact on the students,"" Ms Brown adds. One of the girls in the sports hall, Scarlett, says everyone is good enough at sport and ""it doesn't matter what you do or how you do it, just give it a go and you'll be fine"". Grassroots sport is getting £400m from the government, ministers said in June , to promote health and remove barriers to sport for groups including women and girls. For Stephanie Hilborne, chief executive of Women in Sport, efforts needed to be made to bust a myth ""that teenage girls drop out of sport simply because their priorities change"". ""They're being failed due to early years stereotyping, inadequate opportunities and a complete dearth of knowledge about managing female puberty,"" she added. Worcester's under-16 girls team said the World Cup coverage was inspiring their friends to have a go at rugby The Women's Rugby World Cup has drawn huge crowds, tickets sales have beaten those from the previous tournament and its popularity across the country has been noted by those who play the game. At Worcester Rugby Club, Jessie, who plays for their under-16s team, said the buzz around the tournament had been great. ""I've had my friends from school talk to me about the World Cup who don't even play rugby and we've had about four or five new players this year,"" she said. ""I'd love to be able to play professional rugby. Whatever happens I'll keep on playing, I'll never give it up."" ""I turned on my phone after school today and all I got was rugby social media and I was loving it,"" added Elinor, a flanker in the team. Their team has a strong connection to the Red Roses as they are coached by the first woman to score 60 international tries, former England winger Nicky Crawford, who is also Jessie's mum. ""If you're playing with your friends, then you're more likely to carry on with sport afterwards and you develop lifelong friendships,"" she said. ""The World Cup can get the word out there just how great the world of rugby is, just how accessible it is to everybody and just what fun it is. ""When the Red Roses are scoring the tries and doing the celebrations afterwards, just the smiles on their faces is just rewarding in itself and it inspires girls to say 'I want to do that'."" The success of England's women is something that the Rugby Football Union is looking to build on with data from Sport England showing the number of women and girls playing rugby is rising. They aim to get 100,000 female players of the sport registered by 2027 and are working with the government and other groups on the legacy from this year's World Cup. Funding worth £12.1m has been promised for England and the home unions to create more rugby opportunities for women and girls. Former Red Rose winger Nicola Crawford said playing rugby could lead to girls developing lifelong friendships In 2022, the Worcester club launched what they claimed was the first women's mixed ability team in England and they now hope to start a Midlands and national squad in the future. Their approach offers a safe, welcoming, inclusive space and the age of players ranges from 17 to 57, with those involved choosing to take part in contact or touch rugby. Jennie Hussain said playing in a mixed ability team in Worcester was friendly and supportive Jennie Hussain said she was nervous when she first came to a training session but is now at the club three nights a week.

707443b4e242,Dad's frustration over stillbirth report delay,,"Dad's frustration over stillbirth report delay Joanne Writtle Health correspondent, BBC West Midlands Family picture Thomas and Ewa Hender have two children, with the younger receiving the middle name Aubrey, in memory of his late brother A couple whose son was stillborn have criticised health bosses for taking a year and a half to release a report about stillbirth rates in the Black Country. Thomas and Ewa Hender say they asked the Black Country Integrated Care Board (ICB) to release details in April, when they first became aware of the report. It was actually completed 18 months ago, but it has only recently been released in full - a ""worrying"" delay, Mr Hender said. The report revealed that neonatal deaths and stillbirths across the Black Country have been rising since 2020, with stillbirths rising at a more significant rate. The ICB said the report made recommendations, and progress in maternity care would be monitored. Mr Hender said: ""I think it's worrying that a report regarding perinatal mortality doesn't seem to be very high on the priority list of the ICB if it's taken 18 months to release from completion."" His son Aubrey was stillborn at the former City Hospital in Birmingham in 2022. The Henders said they raised health concerns during the pregnancy, and they believe there were problems with Aubrey's care. The couple are now proud parents to a two-year-old and a three-month-old, the younger of whom has the middle name Aubrey. Family picture Thomas Hender with Aubrey The report looked at all four NHS hospital trusts in the Black Country – Sandwell and West Birmingham, Wolverhampton, Walsall, and Dudley. The areas are among the most deprived in the country. It concentrated on six months from March to September 2023 and found there were 51 stillbirths reported. The review looked at 40 of them. It found 78% of the mums were from deprived areas. In addition, 70% were from black, Asian or minority ethnic backgrounds, with more than half - 50.5% - of a south Asian ethnicity. Fourteen of the women did not speak English as their first language and, the report recorded, interpreting was not used consistently in seven of those cases. Mr Hender said he felt that ""yet again it points to the fact that families from deprived areas and of minority backgrounds are disproportionately affected by poor maternity care. "" But he said the issue also affected people more widely. ""Given the mortality rates, we know that there must be other families out there who like us feel that children's deaths were preventable,"" he said. Sally Roberts, chief nursing officer and deputy chief executive officer for NHS Black Country ICB said: ""Every stillbirth is a devastating loss, our thoughts are with the families who have experienced such unimaginable grief."" She added: ""The report and recommendations have been through robust governance arrangements and shared with maternity units across the Black Country. Those maternity units are now taking action to implement the recommendations and ensure meaningful learning takes place. ""The ICB will continue to monitor progress through the Local Maternity and Neonatal System arrangements in place."" Maternity services moved from City Hospital to the new Midland Metropolitan University Hospital last November. It is part of Sandwell and West Birmingham NHS Trust which is among 14 currently being scrutinised in a rapid review of maternity services across England. Mel Roberts, chief nursing officer and deputy chief executive officer for the trust said: ""We will continue to work closely with the ICB, our maternity teams, and service-user representatives to implement improvements and to reduce the risk of stillbirth across our communities. ""Most importantly, we remain committed to listening to parents and families, ensuring their experiences drive the changes needed to provide the safest possible care for every pregnancy."" The Henders said they would like to see a full statutory public inquiry on maternity services across the country.

61d4f559945c,'My late husband's organs transformed the lives of four people',,"'My late husband's organs transformed the lives of four people' Ken Banks North east Scotland reporter, Stonehaven Hutchinson family Arlene and son Jack pictured with her late husband Mark Arlene Hutchinson's husband, Mark, was only 52 when he died unexpectedly last year after suffering two strokes ""out of the blue"". Like many couples they had never discussed organ donation but she knew it was what he would have wanted. Now Arlene and son Jack, 12, take comfort in the knowledge that Mark has helped transform the lives of others. She said: ""He lives on in four people. That can only be a good thing."" Arlene and Jack, who live near Stonehaven in Aberdeenshire, hope that their story encourages people to speak about the sensitive subject before it is too late. They also want to raise awareness about strokes. Hutchinson family Arlene described Mark as the love of her life Arlene, 51, who works in marketing, met Mark in 2004. He worked in behavioural health and safety but they did not become a couple until 2007. Arlene described him as the love of her life and they married in New York in 2010. Jack was born two years later and they were soon joined by pet dog, Luna. She recalled: ""We had a really happy life together, the three of us."" Arlene said they had a ""healthy"" family lifestyle. The couple were non-smokers, ate well and enjoyed taking Luna for walks. But last summer their lives were suddenly turned upside down. Jack and Arlene say the company of pet dog Luna makes life easier for them Arlene and Jack took the dog for a walk while Mark was in the shower getting ready for a family event. When they got back, Arlene said Mark was emotional. ""He told me he was not feeling right at all, and had fallen,"" she said. ""He just wasn't himself. And he had a numb tongue."" Mark's speech started to go, and one side of his face drooped - classic stroke symptoms. ""It was very, very distressing,"" she said. They tried to keep him calm while they waited for an ambulance. After arriving in hospital, Arlene was told her husband had a blood clot in the brain but was still conscious and sitting up. She said there was ""fear"" in Mark's eyes, and he was taken to the stroke ward. Over the coming days, the talk was of recovery. But Mark then suffered a second stroke and lost consciousness. Arlene said she ""still had hope"" as they waited for scan results, but they revealed the ""devastating"" news that Mark's brain had been left severely damaged. ""There was not any good outcome,"" she said. ""I knew Mark would never want to be like that - where he just could not do anything for himself. ""I will never have to do anything as hard as tell Jack."" As Arlene came to terms with the news she spoke to the donor team. 'Recipient's life has changed' She said: ""We decided that was what we would like to do. ""Mark was going to die. I felt it was an easy decision for me to make. ""Knowing the person Mark was, I know that he would have wanted this wholeheartedly to help others."" He died two days later, and was taken to theatre. Arlene said: ""The amazing specialist organ donation team stepped in. ""They cared for Mark and my family with so much dignity and respect. ""They were with us during our darkest moments and when Mark passed away. ""The team found four recipients for Mark's organs, and we have amazingly since heard from one recipient whose life has completely changed since gaining two kidneys from Mark."" NHS Grampian Jack and Arlene recently unveiled an organ donor artwork in Aberdeen Arlene and Jack recently unveiled an art installation at Aberdeen Royal Infirmary which pays tribute to organ donors. Artist Shelagh Swanson was commissioned to work with the relatives of donors, along with young people at more than a dozen secondary schools, to create the ripple-effect art. Workshops were held with secondary school pupils across Aberdeen, and in Aberdeenshire in Stonehaven, Kemnay, Huntly, Inverurie and Peterhead. Arlene said she was honoured to unveil the artwork and added: ""I am in awe of what the small but dedicated organ donation team achieve and will be forever grateful to them."" What is the law on organ donation in Scotland? Everyone in Scotland became an automatic organ donor from 2021 under new laws, unless they opt out. Under the previous system, more than half of Scotland's population were registered to donate their organs or tissue after their death. It is now presumed that people have consented to donation unless they have stated otherwise. There are some exemptions, including children under the age of 16, and adults who lack the capacity to understand the new law - for example those with dementia. The aim is that more people can be given life-saving and life-changing transplants. People who do not want their organs to be donated for a transplant can opt out through the Organ Donation Scotland website. Hutchinson family Jack said his dad was ""joyful"" Arlene said her husband ""just wanted to spread joy"". She added: ""He was caring, a big softie. He had a massive smile on his face all the time. He was such a happy man."" Reflecting on his loss, she said: ""We will never know why as it was completely out the blue. ""It's been over a year and every day is hard. All of this has changed our lives."" Jack, now 13, described his dad as ""always upbeat, joyful"". He said: ""He was a lot of fun, always doing silly things to make us laugh. He would always wind us up."" Asked how he felt about his father's organs ultimately helping four other people, Jack replied: ""It's a comfort.

52da01c4ba3b,"My eating disorder made me good at lying, says Victoria Beckham",,"My eating disorder made me good at lying, says Victoria Beckham Noor Nanji Culture reporter Getty Images Victoria Beckham pictured at the world premiere for her new Netflix documentary in Mayfair, London on Wednesday ""It's not about him, it's about me,"" declares Victoria Beckham (""him"" being her husband Sir David Beckham). And that's exactly what we get in a new three-part documentary, which drops on Netflix on Thursday. The former Spice Girl and fashion entrepreneur, 51, is determined to tell her own story – two years after former England captain Sir David, 50, released his own, hugely successful TV series . In the episodes, Victoria is strikingly open about her eating disorder, and how it made her ""good at lying"". The series also takes us inside Victoria's pop career, family life, struggles to reinvent herself and preparation for a major show at Paris Fashion Week. There are contributions from famous friends including Eva Longoria, and fashion titans such as Dame Anna Wintour and Donatella Versace. Here are our main takeaways from her documentary. Negative headlines about weight Victoria achieved dizzying fame in the Spice Girls, so it's hard to believe that at school, she was ""that uncool kid"" who didn't fit in. ""I was definitely a loner at school"", she says, explaining she was bullied. She says that she first started getting criticised about her appearance and her weight at a young age. And when she joined the Spice Girls in 1994, she regularly faced negative headlines about her weight. Shutterstock ""I was controlling [the narrative] in an incredibly unhealthy way. When you have an eating disorder, you become very good at lying,"" she said. ""And I was never very honest about it with my parents. I never talked about it publicly. It really affects you, when you're being told constantly you're not good enough. And I suppose that's been with me my whole life."" But Lady Beckham says her bandmates Mel B, Mel C, Emma Bunton and Geri Halliwell made her ""feel more lighthearted, more fun"", and made her ""feel good enough"" about being herself. It's a message she continues to instill in her daughter Harper, 14. ""I tell Harper every day, be who you are,"" she says. What was buried in Baden-Baden? Alamy The WAGS (wives and girlfriends) descended on the spa town of Baden Baden in summer 2006 to support their partners After the release of their chart-topping debut single Wannabe in 1996, ""Spice mania"" swept the planet, with their self-styled ""Girl Power"" mantra - a brand of female empowerment that made them a global pop culture phenomenon. But Geri Halliwell left the Spice Girls in 1998 and the group split up in 2001. Lady Beckham says she found the transition ""really, really difficult"". She carried on making music, but the criticism she received ""really hurt"". Then came the infamous WAG period. Pictures of Victoria and other wives-and-girlfriends supporting their footballer partners in the German town of Baden-Baden in 2006 were plastered all over the tabloids. ""It was fun,"" says Lady Beckham of that time in her life. But she now concedes there was an ""element of attention seeking"" to it all. ""I was trying to find myself, I felt incomplete, sad, frozen in time maybe,"" she says. After the family moved to the US, Lady Beckham decided she wanted to work in fashion. But to do that, she knew she had to shed her other personas – the Spice Girl, the WAG. ""I buried those boobs in Baden-Baden,"" she says. Victoria 'almost lost everything' in struggles with fashion business Lady Beckham is very honest about the struggles her fashion business faced. She says people didn't see her as ""cool at all"", and that a lot of people refused to take her seriously. And Vogue giant Dame Anna cements that view, when she says of Victoria's fashion aspirations: ""I thought maybe this was a hobby. I didn't quite believe it."" We see the growth of Victoria Beckham Ltd but also the serious financial troubles it faced. Sir David says he didn't think her business would survive, while Lady Beckham agrees. ""I almost lost everything and that was a dark, dark time,"" she says. ""I used to cry before I went to work every day because I felt like a firefighter."" Getty Images Romeo, Harper and David Beckham were in Paris last week to support Victoria at her fashion week show She says her firm was ""tens of millions in the red"". In a later scene, her voice breaks, and she wells up in tears, when she recalls how Sir David stepped in to help her business out. But the series also shows her turn things around, and we see her pull out all the stops in the run-up to her triumphant Spring/Summer show at Paris Fashion Week in September 2024. Supermodel Gigi Hadid walked for her, wearing a striking emerald green gown. Dame Anna is shown in attendance, and, in an earlier clip, says Lady Beckham ""totally proved us wrong"". Today, Victoria's business has offices in London and New York, with its flagship store in Mayfair, London. The brand's products are in 230 stores across 50 countries around the world, according to the company's website. Family life carries on, amid reports of feud with Brooklyn EPA (Left to right) David, Victoria, Brooklyn and Nicola Peltz Beckham at the London premiere of Beckham in 2023 The couple's eldest son, 26-year-old Brooklyn, gets a few mentions in the show and appears briefly. Lady Beckham brings him up in conversation, when discussing the morning sickness she faced while pregnant with him and performing with the Spice Girls. But for the past few months, much of the online interest around the Beckhams has focused on reports that Brooklyn and his wife Nicola have fallen out with the rest of the family. The couple were absent from David Beckham's 50th birthday celebrations and did not post a birthday message online, fuelling the intrigue. Nicola has in the past denied there was a feud in the family. Sir David and Lady Beckham have never acknowledged the rumoured rift, and declined to comment when asked by BBC News. We did get a hint on the topic recently from Victoria, who told the Sunday Times how she felt Liam and Noel Gallagher's reconciliation must have made their mother ""so happy"". ""As a mum, that must be... she must feel so happy to see her boys getting on,"" she said. Showbiz reporter Catrina Rose notes there was “no hint” of any alleged feud in the series. ""Victoria's setting a lot of records straight here, but she's not being drawn on this particular topic."" There's a good explanation for why she doesn't smile Getty Images Cruz Beckham, Jackie Apostel, Romeo, Harper, Victoria and David Beckham at the premiere for her new series on Wednesday night Lady Beckham's pout became her defining look in the 1990s. But in the new series, she admits there's a deeper reason as to why she never smiles. ""The minute I see a camera, I change,"" she says. ""The barrier goes up, my armour goes on, and that's when, you know, the miserable cow that doesn't smile - that's when she comes out. And I'm so conscious of that."" She adds that she would ""rather not be that person"" and wishes she had the confidence to walk out in front of cameras and smile. Elsewhere, she insists that she does actually smile. ""I've looked miserable for all these years because when we stand on the red carpet, this guy has always gone on the left,"" she says, gesturing at Sir David. ""When I smile, I smile from the left, because if I smile from the right, I look unwell. So consequently I'm smiling on the inside, but no one ever sees it, so that's why I look so moody."" New use for a noisy kitchen blender? The programme is filled with small details about the Beckhams' relationship – many of which we didn't know before. For example, Sir David starts a blender when he doesn't want to listen to Victoria (so she says, anyway). The pair have fond memories of their whirlwind romance in the 1990s, which led to them getting married and having a baby within two years. Sir David reflects that his parents - and his manager - would have preferred him to marry a local girl who stayed in Manchester, where he was playing for Manchester United. ""But I didn't want that,"" he says, opting instead for globe-trotting celebrity Victoria. ""I was so excited, I wanted everyone to know I was dating Posh Spice,"" the former England captain says. Lady Beckham, for her part, says she was never a young girl dreaming of getting married or becoming a mum. ""It wasn't until I met David that those things even occurred to me,"" she says. There won't be another Beckham baby In the final episode, which was filmed before Sir David's 50th birthday this year, the pair get reflective about everything they have achieved, and what lies ahead for them. ""Success, it feels good, I'm not going to lie,"" says Victoria. ""I've still got a lot that I want to do."" Sir David, for his part, seems to have something else on his mind. ""Now we're both, well I'm almost 50, you're 51, what's next? Another baby?,"" David asks his wife. Victoria laughs. ""Another baby? My God. No."" Victoria Beckham, a three-part documentary series, is available now on Netflix.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/crrj4v9wre8o,Health,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/43cc/live/0f472f90-a4fd-11f0-b741-177e3e2c2fc7.jpg,2025-10-09T10:08:18.350000+00:00,d07a8abb246d0bfd3afb16403a7c1d489324652a
cf51b078ccf3,'I missed a £100 council tax bill while in hospital – the debt ballooned to £6k',,"'I missed a £100 council tax bill while in hospital – the debt ballooned to £6k' Vicky Johnson, Lucy Parry, Alice Evans and Gerry Georgieva BBC Yorkshire & Lincolnshire Investigations Mike Barley Mike Barley was in hospital for a month following a motorbike accident When Mike Barley almost died in a motorbike crash on the way home from work, he did not think his biggest worry during recovery would be the council tax bill he had been sent that same day. But after he missed a payment reminder letter while in hospital, his debts rocketed out of control. Mr Barley, 26, from Grimsby, North East Lincolnshire, had a ""well-paid"" job as a software developer, and owned his own home, but the accident in March 2021 put him in hospital for a month with broken ribs, a collapsed lung, and severe injuries to his arms and legs. The same day as the accident, Mr Barley was sent a council tax bill for an instalment of £101.71. He missed the payment and was still in hospital when a reminder letter was sent to his home, so he missed that, too. Mr Barley said he was ""stuck"" on sick pay of £90 a week at the time and remembered thinking: ""I've got no income any more - I can't work, I can't walk. Where is this money going to come from?"" He says after telling his local council he would not be able to pay, they sent another letter, in June 2021, setting out a payment plan. It included two months of reduced payments but then demanded Mr Barley pay the rest of the year's payments in advance – a total of about £1,000. Mr Barley's council acted in line with the usual process for unpaid council tax in England. If you do not pay your monthly bill after three weeks, or you have three late payments, councils can demand the remainder of the year's bill in full, and can send in bailiffs to collect the debt. Charities have long claimed the method of council tax debt enforcement in England punishes people who are genuinely struggling to pay - while the government says it is taking action against ""archaic and aggressive"" practices. BBC News Mike Barley fell behind on his bills after a motorbike accident in 2021 After further reminder letters and warnings, Mr Barley's case was passed to bailiffs, who sent a ""threatening letter"" telling him they would be coming over to seize and sell his belongings to help pay off his debt. ""It was scary to be honest,"" he said. Council tax funds public services such as care for the elderly, libraries and bin collections. It must be paid by anyone who owns a home, or lives in rented accommodation, unless they are eligible for exemptions. When councils bring in bailiffs to try to recover council tax debt, the person who owes money is charged an additional £75 for the initial bailiffs' letter, £235 plus costs if a bailiff comes to their home to remove or sell goods, a £110 sale fee if goods are taken for sale, and 7.5% of the debt value over £1,500. Mr Barley said he tried to dispute the charges he faced because of the late bill, but received no support and bailiffs continued to deliver letters to his home. ""It just makes you trapped, depressed,"" he said. More stories from the investigations team Mr Barley said his relationship broke down under the strain of trying to cope with his escalating council tax debt, which he estimates reached a total of about £6,000. He fell behind on his mortgage and other payments too. He managed to get a credit card cleared, but his home was eventually repossessed, and he said he had such little money to spend on food that his meals consisted of bread smeared with ketchup. He said his council tax debt was ""probably the worst"" to deal with because of the speed with which the total amount increased. Mr Barley still owes about £1,700 of the £6,000, including £700 of bailiffs' fees. He wants councils to stop bringing in bailiffs when the person in debt cannot pay. ""It just adds charges,"" he said. ""If [people] can't pay it in the first place, giving it to a bailiff is then going to make it harder."" Councils in East Yorkshire and Lincolnshire referred about 38% more people to bailiffs in the most recent year of data than the previous 12 months, our research found. North East Lincolnshire Council said it could not comment on individual cases but had set aside a £100,000 hardship fund to support some of those unable to pay off their council tax debt. The council said on a case-by-case basis it sometimes gives people extra time to pay back their council tax, or helps them find ways to reduce their bill. Councils can decide to write off some debt too. Matt Sheeran, of free-to-use debt advice service Money Wellness, said people should seek help straight away if they did have problems paying their council tax. ""It's just so fast and so aggressive, so a lot of people are taken aback,"" he said. ""They just don't realise how quickly [it] can escalate."" Money Wellness Matt Sheeran, of Money Wellness, said the speed of the council tax debt-collection process can often take people by surprise Peter Tutton, policy director at the StepChange charity, which also offers free debt advice, added the pressure some councils put on people when they chased payments could make people's financial difficulties ""worse"". ""People respond to payment demands by missing other bills, turning their heating down, borrowing,"" Mr Tutton said. Figures published in June showed local authorities in England are owed £6.6bn in council tax in total, up 50% from £4.4bn five years ago - despite councils writing off more council tax debt than they used to. In the most recent year of data, £250m such debt was written off, in comparison to £134m five years ago. Further data obtained by the BBC through Freedom of Information requests revealed: Councils are increasingly referring people to bailiffs to help retrieve outstanding debt. Across the 253 councils that provided us with information, 1.4 million accounts were referred to bailiffs in the past year – 46% more than four years ago. But the average amount they have been able to retrieve per account has gone down slightly, suggesting bailiff action may not be as effective as it used to be. In Bradford, West Yorkshire, the council referred 41% more people to bailiffs in the most recent year of data than the previous 12 months, our research found. The council put up council tax rates by almost 10% this year, as it tries to deal with rising debts which will see it owe more than £1bn by 2030. Those affected include Edmund Davies, who owes about £1,800 in council tax and is struggling to make ends meet with the £295 he receives in benefits each month. He said the council tax increase has made things much more difficult for people in his position. ""I'd like to pay it - it's just trying to come to an actual affordable agreement with the council that's difficult,"" said Mr Davies, who also pays £20 a month towards council text debt he owed from his previous address. ""To pay any more… do I eat today, do I eat this week?"" he said. BBC News Edmund Davies says the council tax increase in Bradford has been tough Mr Davies recently received groceries from the Bradford North Foodbank, where demand has risen by 30% over the past year. Foodbank manager Franco Biancardo said some of this increase was down to council tax debt. He is calling for the council to collect the debt ""in a softer way"" instead of going through the courts process. Bradford Council said it was committed to helping those struggling to pay council tax and has given an extra £1.2m in support this year. A spokesperson added that the rise in enforcement visits in the past year was due to reasons including new charges for homes left empty over a year, and clearing a backlog of cases. Central government is currently reviewing council tax debt-enforcement practices. A spokesperson for the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government said it was ""taking robust action to tackle the archaic and aggressive collection practices that have seen vulnerable people who miss payments subjected to unmanageable lump sum payments and liability orders"". A spokesperson for the Local Government Association said councils had ""a duty to residents to collect taxes"" and that bailiffs and other enforcement were ""a last resort"".",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn43439n4xxo,Health,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/c75f/live/c8448030-a465-11f0-8c79-29eeaf2ea52d.png,2025-10-09T05:18:07.892000+00:00,49bbe5793dc2df19667445aa716126c1e5a805a0
5b7d80f55b23,EastEnders' Kellie Bright on the challenges of being parent of an autistic child,,"EastEnders' Kellie Bright on the challenges of being parent of an autistic child Kellie Bright Presenter, BBC Panorama (with additional reporting by Doug Faulkner, BBC News) Kellie Bright I've been desperate to make a documentary about special educational needs and disabilities (Send) for ages. You might know me as EastEnders' Linda Carter but I'm also a mum to my autistic son. He's also dyslexic and has ADHD. It took months of perseverance and hard work from my husband and I to try to get the right education for him. At times, it felt like a battle. That is why I wanted to make this film for Panorama, so I could meet other families who were going through the same thing, and speak to teachers, councils and the government about how Send children are educated in England. There are more than 1.7 million children in England with Send. It is a broad group, including autistic children and people who struggle with speech and language, have ADHD and physical disabilities, among other conditions. Schools in England already provide some support to these students but if parents think their child needs extra help they can make an application to their council for what's called an Education, Health and Care Plan (EHCP). An EHCP is a crucial document because it is legally binding, states where a child should go to school and outlines how much extra support they should get. My husband and I spent hours filling in the forms to request an EHCP and many families find the process very frustrating. Buddy and Tunde Not long after I meet 15-year-old Buddy, he shows me his favourite cuddly toy, Reindeer Dog. Buddy's autistic, meaning his brain experiences and reacts to the world in a different way from many people's. He struggles with meeting people his own age, understanding his emotions and anxiety. Buddy likes to keep Reindeer Dog close to him. After moving to London from Scotland in October 2024, Buddy's mum, Tunde, started applying for schools. She says she tried at least 11 schools but many of them didn't get back to her, and those that did said they were full or could not give Buddy extra support without an EHCP. At the start of this year more than 638,000 EHCPs had been issued to children and young people in England, a 10.8% rise on the year before and an 80% increase in six years. The increase is partly because parents and schools have got better at identifying children who have special educational needs, especially autism, as opposed to there being more children with Send. It is the second time Buddy and Tunde have applied for an EHCP. Their first application was turned down before Buddy was assessed. Councils reject about a quarter of EHCP applications at the assessment stage, according to the Department for Education. When they lived in Scotland, Tunde says they did not have to apply for the equivalent of an EHCP. Buddy's comprehensive school arranged support for his learning, although not for his emotional needs. Scotland has a different system for helping children with Send; schools there aim to deliver more support without the need for parents to apply for the equivalent of an EHCP. ""It's a madness,"" Tunde says. ""[Getting extra support] was so easily done, and it could be easily done again."" While Buddy is not able to go to school, the council is providing him with 19 hours of lessons per week in the local library. Tunde tells me the process of applying for an EHCP has been so time consuming she had to stop working as a midwife and health visitor for a time. ""I can't do the parenting. I can't get him to these appointments, and work at the same time… I couldn't get my son seen in the right amount of time and see other people's babies in the right amount time. And it was a toss up - and my son won,"" she says. We catch up with Buddy after a lengthy speech and language assessment. ""Draining… that's all I've got for you,"" he says as he leans against a fence, Reindeer Dog tucked under his arm. Buddy often takes Reindeer Dog to give him comfort A school for Buddy It's September and as millions of children start term, Buddy is still being taught in the library. Two months after I first met him, he's getting an EHCP but his education is still not settled. The council agreed to Tunde's request that he go to an independently run school that works with children who struggle in mainstream schools. Before Buddy can start there, the school has already taken over the lessons he receives in the library. But Tunde's now not sure the school will be able to deliver what she believes her son needs to improve his social skills and confidence with children his own age. ""We were all prepared for September… and he's still not at school, he's still having one-to-one,"" she said. ""I think … preparing to be around other kids and then still just being one-to-one with adults has really knocked him back and made him not want to go to school."" Southwark Council says it takes Tunde's concerns very seriously and it will continue to support her family to ensure they receive the provision they need without further delay. It says it knows how hard it can be for families to navigate the system, and how distressing delays in securing support can be. It says it has invested in a specialist information and advice team, and now ensures children are assessed by specialist teachers at the earliest stage, and it is open to reviewing the situation when parents are concerned about education placements. 'The current system is broken' I know there is another side to this story. The huge rise in the number of EHCPs is putting councils under severe financial pressure. It is estimated by the Department for Education that English councils are set to run up a total accumulated Send deficit between £4.3bn and £4.9bn by March 2026. The government says it has invested a billion pounds to help councils pay for EHCPs and £740m on new Send school places . I went to West Sussex County Council to interview one of few people in local government prepared to talk to me on the record about Send funding. Jacquie Russell is a Conservative councillor and cabinet member for children, young people and learning. ""The current system is actually very adversarial. Our parents are increasingly tired and anxious and fed up of fighting… Staff sickness levels are really, really high at the moment,"" she says. ""The current system doesn't work. It is broken. It's not delivering the best outcomes for children."" Jacquie Russell says the current Send system is putting unsustainable pressure on councils Demand for EHCPs is now outstripping funding in West Sussex. In 2015, the council had about 3,400 children with an EHCP. Today there are more than 10,000. As a result the Send deficit has been growing year-on-year, so that at the end of 2025 it stands at more than £123m. ""That [money] is really essentially meant to be for local services. That would have ordinarily gone to repair your roads… and other local services,"" she says. ""The current position is not sustainable."" The government agrees. It is planning major reforms of the Send system, though final plans have not yet been agreed. The minister for school standards, Georgia Gould, told me the upcoming reforms were ""not taking support away from families"". ""We're wanting to put more support in earlier,"" she said. ""Where people have fought for support, and that's in place, we want to make sure that that support continues."" She also told me she wanted to work with parents to get the reforms right and to get support at the ""earliest possible point rather than having to battle"". The minister added that parents would still have a ""legal basis"" to get support. Worried parents held a rally in Westminster last month as the government mulls over reforms to the system For me, and thousands of other parents of Send children, applying for an EHCP feels like a battle about your child's future. Who does not want the best possible education for their son or daughter? But for every parent fighting, there is a council counting the cost. All eyes are now on the government to see if its reforms can relieve the pressure on so many families.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0jqy8pn275o,Health,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/f006/live/37372320-a07a-11f0-b741-177e3e2c2fc7.jpg,2025-10-06T00:35:51.441000+00:00,a2ce4cd897a0a0405a03fa7009de95b84626b8ab
9557c8c9e3dd,What exactly is freshers' flu - and why do so many get it?,,"What exactly is freshers' flu - and why do so many get it? Getty Images It's the second week of term. You've finally figured out how to use the washing machine, your flatmates are starting to feel like friends, and the whirlwind of freshers' week is behind you. But just as things settle down, your throat starts to scratch, your nose runs, and suddenly lectures are less about learning and more about trying not to cough louder than the person next to you. You were warned it would happen, but didn't expect it to hit quite so fast. What's actually going on here? Why does everyone seem to get freshers' flu in the first few weeks of term? And why do so many say it feels worse than the average cold? ""Freshers' flu is just an assortment of common cold viruses that come and hit us all at the same time,"" says Dr Zania Stamataki, associate professor of viral immunology at the University of Birmingham. It's not an actual flu, and it's rarely serious. But when thousands of students arrive on campus they bring with them a cocktail of respiratory viruses. Add packed lecture theatres, dirty shared kitchens and late-night parties, and the result is a wave of illness that spreads quickly. Sheena Cruickshank, an immunologist and professor in biomedical sciences at the University of Manchester, describes it as a ""mixing pot"" of infections. ""You're bringing people together from all over the world, putting them in close quarters, and exposing them to viruses they've never encountered before,"" she says. Respiratory viruses are constantly evolving and even small differences between variants can mean the body's immune system doesn't recognise them, forcing it to start from scratch. The role of drinking, diet and stress Getty Images The immune system is the body's natural defence against infections. It's made up of a network of cells, tissues, and organs that work together to detect harmful invaders like viruses and bacteria, and help the body fight them off. But during freshers' week your immune system is under-resourced and overworked. That's because, as Prof Cruickshank explains, ""your diet, your level of activity, your level of stress, and sleep are all factors that affect immune functions."" Which, she recognises, are ""not necessarily the first focus"" for students in the early weeks of university. Among these, stress plays a particularly disruptive role. The pressure to settle in, make friends, manage new responsibilities, and keep up with academic demands can quickly become overwhelming. This triggers the release of cortisol, a stress hormone that suppresses immune responses. ""We've all had those times when you're super stressed, you've got loads of deadlines, you work, work, work, you finish all the deadlines - and then you get ill,"" says Prof Cruickshank. Stress can also impact the amount of sleep you get, which also impacts the immune system. But for many students, the pressure to socialise and make friends during freshers' week outweighs the need to rest. Imogen says freshers' flu lingers for quite a while ""I didn't want to miss out,"" says Imogen Farmer, 19, a second-year student at the University of Leeds. She says she met up with friends every evening during freshers' week. ""I definitely suffered with it after the first week, like sore throat, runny nose, those typical symptoms, and it does linger for quite a while."" Imogen says it's been worth it because ""so much of student culture, especially during freshers' week, revolves around nights out"". ""That is how you meet a lot of people and bond with friends. So I did just say yes to everything."" Getty Images But it's not just lack of sleep which makes life difficult for your immune system. After drinking a lot of alcohol - which many students will no doubt be doing - your body produces fewer white blood cells, which help to fight off infections. ""A lot of people have the misconception that if you're consuming alcohol, you sleep better. But you have higher stress and you sleep worse,"" says Dr Stamataki. A poor diet can also weaken the immune system and, for many students, eating healthily isn't easy - especially when skipping meals is a regular occurrence. You'll feel great... but you'll be transmitting With so many viruses around, you could be stuck in a lecture between two people who are sneezing, each infected with a different one. And you'd be exposed to both. Viruses can then be passed on very easily, without you knowing (during the incubation period), and before you notice symptoms. ""Sometimes you think you've gotten away with it. And you haven't,"" Dr Stamataki warns. ""So you'll feel great. You'll go and play rugby, you'll hug your friends and you'll have a good time but at the same time, you'll be transmitting."" She says that the immune response within young people is ""quite powerful"" but it's limited by the fact they haven't been exposed to many viruses yet. While everything you come across for the first time will make you sick, the next time you come across the same virus, the symptoms won't be as nasty. You can also get two infections at once. This can help or hinder your body. Either you'll start to feel really awful - because your immune system is struggling to cope - or your body's defences will start working overtime to deal with the invaders. When that happens, the immune system ""is already super pumped up,"" says Prof Cruickshank, because the body is busy making chemical messengers called cytokines that help to kill viruses. If you're unlucky enough to get a second infection soon after you've got rid of the first one, it's usually because you're already rundown. That's when conditions like bronchitis can occur. ""If your symptoms are persisting for a really long time or you felt like you're getting better and then you get ill again, it might be worth getting some medical help just to check that,"" says Prof Cruickshank. ""If you see spots at the back of your throat, that's definitely a sign that you've got strep throat and you might need some antibiotics,"" she adds. Viruses like colds and flu don't respond to antibiotics - these drugs are only used to treat some types of bacterial infection. How do I know if it's something more serious? While most viruses are mild, some can be far more dangerous and meningitis is a serious infection to watch out for. It can look a lot like freshers' flu, but if left untreated, it can lead to seizures, brain damage and sepsis. One student, from Wolverhampton, had her lower legs and parts of her fingers amputated after being struck down with it a week after starting university. Vaccines which help protect against various types of meningitis are given to children, but it's still important to be aware of the symptoms, even if you've had the jabs. So what do you need to look out for? a high temperature or fever being sick a headache a rash that does not fade when a glass is rolled over it (but a rash will not always develop) a stiff neck a dislike of bright lights drowsiness or unresponsiveness seizures (fits) Meningitis spreads in a similar way to a cold - through close contact with someone carrying the infection. It causes inflammation of the membranes surrounding the brain and spinal cord, so if you recognise these symptoms, call 999 or go to A&E straight away. Emily Valentine says there is pressure to keep going during an illness There are also two new Covid variants which are spreading throughout the UK. Experts say they are likely to only cause minor illnesses, but recent genetic changes to the virus may make infections more likely. For many students, the pressure to keep going, even when sick, is hard to ignore. ""You're pushing yourself so much because that's what you're being told to do,"" says Emily Valentine, a 19-year-old student at the University of Leeds. ""I tend to rest, but I know a lot of my friends try to push themselves to go to lectures, especially in the first week,"" she adds. A shift to recording lectures during the pandemic has made it easier for students to catch up with work. But experts say you should still give yourself time to recover. ""It can take your body a while to get over a really big assault from a virus,"" says Prof Cruickshank.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c147218x7rgo,Health,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/eec1/live/55b7b6a0-a35b-11f0-9915-9bcc1e7b7b03.png,2025-10-04T23:05:38.967000+00:00,ca36d06b5c28fcf97fdb4b4890dd70c21923d05d
6117427ce013,Scientists win Nobel Prize for discovering why immune system does not destroy the body,,"Scientists win Nobel Prize for discovering why immune system does not destroy the body James Gallagher Health and science correspondent Getty Images The Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine 2025 has been awarded for discoveries that explain how the immune system attacks hostile infections, but not the body's own cells. The prize is shared by Japan's Shimon Sakaguchi and US researchers Mary Brunkow and Fred Ramsdell. They discovered ""security guards"" that eliminate parts of the immune system that could attack the body. Their work is being used to develop new treatments for autoimmune diseases and cancer. The winners share a prize fund worth 11m Swedish kronor (£870,000). ""Their discoveries have been decisive for our understanding of how the immune system functions and why we do not all develop serious autoimmune diseases,"" says Olle Kämpe, chair of the Nobel Committee. The trio's research is critical to understanding how the immune system works – how does it protect us from thousands of different infections that are trying to invade the body? But, at the same time, leaves our own tissues unscathed? Our immune system uses white blood cells that look for signs of infection – even viruses and bacteria that it has never met before. The cells use sensors – called receptors – that are made randomly in a quadrillion different combinations. This gives the immune systems the capability to attack a wide variety of invaders, but the randomness of the process inevitably makes white blood cells that can attack our body. Scientists already knew that some of these problematic white blood cells were destroyed in the thymus – where white blood cells mature. The Nobel prize this year goes to the discovery of regulatory T-cells – known as the immune system's security guards – which travel the body to disarm any other immune cells attacking the body. We know this process fails in autoimmune diseases like type-1 diabetes, multiple sclerosis and rheumatoid arthritis. The Nobel panel added: ""The discoveries have laid the foundation for a new field of research and spurred the development of new treatments, for example for cancer and autoimmune diseases."" In cancer, the regulatory T-cells stop the body from fighting the tumour so research is focused on reducing their numbers. In autoimmune diseases, trials are looking at boosting regulatory T-cells so the body is no longer being attacked. A similar approach could also be effective in reducing the risks of an organ transplant being rejected. 'Striking' Prof Shimon Sakaguchi, from Osaka University, Japan, performed experiments on mice which had their thymus removed to make them develop autoimmune disease. He showed that injecting immune cells from other mice could prevent the disease – suggesting there was some system for preventing immune cells attacking the body. Mary Brunkow, from the Institute for Systems Biology in Seattle, and Fred Ramsdell now at Sonoma Biotherapeutics in San Francisco, were exploring an inherited autoimmune disease in mice and people that led to the discovery of a gene important for how regulatory T-cells function. Professor Annette Dolphin, president of the UK's Physiological Society, said: ""Their pioneering work has revealed how the immune system is kept in check by regulatory T cells, preventing it from mistakenly attacking the body's own tissues. ""This work is a striking example of how fundamental physiological research can have far-reaching implications for human health.""",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c2knwvpd7vno,Health,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/7d22/live/4ce477f0-a29a-11f0-b5fb-09dc1426da0e.jpg,2025-10-06T10:28:37.583000+00:00,5e0033b5ee5ea5f6cf47e05e2e0e50ec2c48b881
9d7e523c20f1,How weight-loss injections are turning obesity into a wealth issue,,"How weight-loss injections are turning obesity into a wealth issue Nick Triggle Health correspondent BBC Three years ago, a fashion editor friend returned from Milan Fashion Week bursting with a story to tell. Most fashion editors stayed at the same hotel, she explained, and each bedroom had its own mini fridge. After checking out, en route to the airport, a stylist in her party cried out that he'd left ""an important package"" in his fridge and telephoned the hotel, pleading with them not to throw it away. ""Turns out he'd forgotten his Ozempic,"" my editor friend whispered. We were baffled. Ozempic? Back then, Ozempic was not part of the common lexicon. But quietly, in certain circles, this injectable drug, which is licensed for the treatment of type 2 diabetes, was being prescribed privately and off-label for weight loss. Flash forward to today and the picture is vastly different. ""So many fashion people are on it,"" she tells me today. ""And now they're very vocal."" Serena Williams, Elon Musk and Whoopi Goldberg have all spoken about using weight-loss injections. Some are now prescribed by the NHS, including Wegovy and Mounjaro, generating scores of headlines. Really, this should have made it a great leveller. In theory, anyone struggling with obesity can - without the expense of a private doctor - get help to manage their weight. Only that's not the full picture. AFP via Getty Images 'So many fashion people are on it and now they're very vocal,' says one London-based fashion editor (Milan Fashion Week is pictured) Thousands of NHS patients are believed to be missing out. And with the NHS tightly restricting access, some working in the field warn a two-tier system around weight-loss drugs is developing - one that's benefitting the most well-off. Martin Fidock, who is UK managing director of Oviva, which provides Wegovy and lifestyle support to NHS patients, claims that thanks to varying thresholds of eligibility in different regions, NHS prescriptions are a ""postcode lottery"". An estimated 1.5 million people in the UK use these drugs - but more than nine in 10 are believed to pay privately. Prices vary but it generally costs between £100 and £350 a month, depending on the dose and lifestyle support. Then, last month, it was reported that pharmaceutical giant Eli Lilly was expected to increase the list price of Mounjaro by as much as 170%. They have since done a deal for UK distributors, meaning rises are likely to be less, and the rises don’t affect the cost to the NHS - but it has still caused concern in some quarters. ""It's scary,"" says Brad, a tech company worker in his 40s. He has been taking Mounjaro for a year and worries he may not be able to afford to continue. ""I've lost 20kg and want to keep using it, but it's a lot of money. It's unfair."" Getty Images (R) AFP via Getty Images (L) Wegovy was called the 'Viagra' of weight-loss drugs - the huge interest around it is partly fuelled by social media buzz and celebrity users, including Elon Musk Nutritionists and GPs I spoke to have also expressed concerns about the broader system, and in particular whether existing health inequalities could worsen. ""We cannot allow good health to become a luxury for the wealthiest by limiting access to weight-loss drugs to those who can pay privately,"" argues Katharine Jenner, executive director of Obesity Health Alliance. So could it really be that weight-loss injections - for all of their benefits - are turning obesity into a wealth issue? The NHS 'postcode lottery' Weight-loss drugs have been available on the NHS for some time, but the landscape changed significantly with the introduction of some newer medications - among them, semaglutide, marketed under the brand name Wegovy, and tirzepatide, sold as Mounjaro. Wegovy was first prescribed for obesity by the NHS in 2023, while Mounjaro followed earlier this year. They work in part as an appetite suppressant by mimicking a hormone, which makes people feel fuller. Studies have suggested patients can lose as much as a fifth of their body weight. They are licensed for people with a BMI of 27 or more for those with a health condition or above 30 for those without (adjusted for certain ethnic groups). But tougher NHS criteria are being applied, and in England and Wales the drugs are mostly restricted to those with a BMI of over 35. Plus there are more restrictions too. For Wegovy, local areas are making their own decisions on access. Martin Fidock claims that in recent months a third of regional health boards have increased the BMI threshold, which he says has resulted in fewer people being able to get it. (The BBC has been unable to verify this data.) A spokesperson for Novo Nordisk, the pharmaceutical giant that makes Wegovy, told the BBC it is ""concerned about the growing disparity"" in access to NHS specialist weight management services. ""This has led to a large proportion of people needing to pay out of pocket, an option which is out of reach in areas of deprivation where obesity rates are significantly higher."" NHS England has said the differences could be related to different levels of need and other providers being more active in certain regions, but confirmed it was up to local areas to decide how much to spend. Reuters While Ozempic is intended for those with type 2 diabetes, Wegovy is prescribed specifically for weight loss For Mounjaro, NHS England has started it for people with a BMI above 40 who also have certain health conditions. The NHS roll-out officially began in June, but a report published earlier this month suggests that not all general practices had started offering it. Just 18 out of 42 NHS boards across England confirmed that they'd begun prescribing it in line with the roll-out plan, according to data obtained by freedom of information requests published in the BMJ. The NHS has previously said it is supporting the phased rollout for eligible patients and that ""these represent brand-new services in primary care that are being established and scaled up over time"". But Mr Fidock believes we are seeing a ""postcode lottery"". ""We have got an obesity epidemic and these drugs provide us with an opportunity to tackle it in a way we have never been able to do before. But your ability to benefit is dependent largely on whether you have the means to pay."" Adding to the challenge is the fact that more people from deprived areas struggle with obesity in the first place: more than a third of people in the most deprived areas are obese – twice that of more affluent neighbourhoods. Beyond the physical health risks - and there are many, including higher risks of cancer and heart disease, plus mental health problems - there may be social consequences too. One US study found that obese men with a bachelor's degree earn 5% less than their thinner colleagues, while those with a graduate degree earn 14% less. For obese women it is worse still, earning 12% and 19% less respectively, based on data concerning 23,000 US workers, published in The Economist in 2023. NHS GP Matthew Calcasola, who is also involved in a service Get a Drip, which offers weight-loss drugs privately, has his own concerns. ""We're concerned health inequality will build,"" he says. ""GPs worry about this."" Private patients priced out Meanwhile, a booming private market has emerged. Sara de Souza, a business analyst from Nottingham, is among those delighted that it has. Following the birth of her son Vito in 2023, she put on 30kg. ""I got to 96kg,"" she recalls. ""Me and my husband both got into bad habits. We were so busy, we were eating junk food and having chocolates. ""I was always tired and struggled to pick up my baby. But I just couldn't lose the weight."" Sara tried dieting and went to see her GP who referred her to a lifestyle diet and activity programme. But still the pounds stuck. At her heaviest her BMI was 37.5, but she wasn't eligible for NHS access and paid £200 a month for the drug through an app called Juniper, which also gave her diet and lifestyle advice. Within a year she had lost the full 30kg. Sara says the cost didn't impact her. 'Even if it had, I'd have carried on, because of the benefits' ""It completely changed my life. I felt like a new person, alive again. It's not just how I look, it's how I feel and being able to keep up with my son."" Sara says the cost didn't impact her. ""Even if it had, I'd have carried on, because of the benefits."" Not everyone feels the same. Some 18% of overweight Britons would be willing to pay for weight-loss drugs - but if they were available on the NHS, 59% said they would be keen on using them, according to new polling by communications agency Strand Partners. And some of those willing to pay privately fear they could find themselves being priced out following the proposed price spike. Getty Images 'Some people can't move on to the higher doses because of cost,' says the UK head of an online pharmacy, speaking about weight-loss drugs in general ""If I'd had to pay £300 or even more, I would have really struggled to afford it,"" says Pete Beech, 57, from Southampton. He weighed 18 stone and paid £160 a month for a prescription of Mounjaro to help him lose weight to qualify for an ultrasound treatment as part of his treatment for prostate cancer. ""The way the NHS is rationing these drugs has consequences beyond just obesity."" James O'Loan, head of online pharmacy Chemist4U, has already observed some people stretching themselves financially to get hold of weight-loss drugs - some have asked for payment plans, which they cannot offer. ""Some people can't move on to the higher doses because of cost,"" he explains. Getty Images for ESSENCE Serena Williams has spoken out about using weight-loss drugs - she says, to lift 'stigma' around them Then there are concerns about a weight-loss drug black market, or unscrupulous dispensing. ""Some services are desperate to dispense the stuff and don't care what happens,"" claims Professor Richard Donnelly, editor of medical journal Diabetes, Obesity and Metabolism. ""People are just asked to fill in a quick questionnaire. There's no proper medical assessment or follow up."" He also stresses that they should not be seen as a quick fix. ""They're not there to lose a bit of fat around the tummy."" Whilst generally well tolerated, there are risks of certain side effects — including nausea, constipation and diarrhoea. A study into potential serious side effects of weight loss jabs has also been launched after hundreds of people reported problems with their pancreas. The NHS advises people never take a medicine for weight management if it has not been prescribed for them. 'Not a magic bullet' Some argue that the answer is, simply, to widen NHS access. The issue, of course, comes in part down to cost. Michael Shah, senior analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence, believes that this could start to resolve itself in time. ""There are more than 160 weight-loss drugs in clinical development,"" he says. Once available, he predicts that the competition could push costs down across the board. ""NHS bargaining power should improve as additional players and treatments enter the space."" Kevin Mazur/WireImage via Getty Images Actress Whoopi Goldberg has said: 'I weighed almost 300 pounds... I was on all this stuff and one of the things that has helped me drop the weight is Mounjaro' Earlier this year the Tony Blair Institute suggested that the drugs should be offered to everyone with BMIs over 27, arguing that it costs even more to deal with the consequences of obesity. Obesity is estimated to cost the economy £98bn a year, according to research commissioned by the think tank, once you take into account lost productivity as well as the NHS treatment costs and the impact on the individual. The Institute suggests a means-tested system with those entitled to free prescriptions getting it free and others self-funding or encouraging employers to share the cost. NHS England has said it is looking at an option to ""accelerate roll out to even more people in the future"". But it also pointed out that weight loss drugs should not be seen as a ""magic bullet"". Are we medicalising a social issue? All of this begs a broader question - that is, in medicalising debates around tackling obesity, do we risk overlooking the wider social issue? ""By thinking we have a treatment for obesity we lose focus and stop thinking about the more difficult issues around the food industry and regulation, which are the root cause of this,"" warns Greg Fell, president of the Association of Directors of Public Health. ""I do have concerns about equity of access,"" he adds. ""But I think the NHS has carefully thought about this and probably is, more or less, in the right place."" Getty Images Obesity was rare In post-war Britain due to food shortages - there wasn't the convenience food culture of today either In post-war Britain, obesity was rare due to food shortages and physically demanding lifestyles – lower-income groups were more likely to suffer from malnutrition. Only since the 1980s have obesity rates risen across all social classes, with a growing disparity between rich and poor. It is driven by several interconnected factors. Katharine Jenner argues there needs to be more done to address one of them in particular: our ""broken food system"". ""People in poorer areas are surrounded by junk food advertising, more unhealthy takeaways, and face bigger barriers to buying healthy food,"" she says. ""Without investment in prevention, health will get worse, inequalities will widen, and the costs will fall on all of us."" How to effectively achieve that is perhaps the biggest question of all. But whatever the answer - and regardless of whether the onus really should be on the state or as others argue, the individual - it runs far deeper than the cost of a weight-loss jab. ""We live in a society that prizes freedom of choice and expression, values material wealth and tolerates vast inequality,"" argues Chris Rojek, sociology professor at City St George's, University of London. ""In such a system, casualties are inevitable. ""It would be naïve — or even pious — to claim we can simply solve this. The answer is complex and touches the very fabric of our society.""

But on the eve of her 16th birthday, her life changed forever. Severe propeller lacerations from a horrific boat accident left doctors with no choice but to amputate her right foot. Initially she continued to pursue rugby, but her agility and speed weren't the same and she grew tired of comparing her performance to when she had both feet. ""I didn't want to give up on my goal just because I was an amputee, but life is constantly changing and we have to update our goals instead of forcing them to work in a reality that no longer exists,"" she says. So she moved on from rugby and took up athletics. Using a light, springy carbon-fibre blade on her right leg, she eventually became a world champion Paralympic long jumper and sprinter for both Canada and Great Britain - winning medals, breaking records and receiving an MBE. She's now retired from professional sport, but has shown a similar adaptability and resilience in her new career which includes acting, modelling and broadcasting including competing in Dancing on Ice. Now she's campaigning for big brands such as Nike, Adidas and Puma to sell single shoes rather than pairs. In part it's about cost - high-end running shoes cost around £200, and when she was competing she only needed one but had to buy two, meaning she wasted hundreds of pounds on shoes she never wore. But her biggest motivation - is the principle. Many of the big brands proudly display models with blades in their shop windows, but don't sell shoes individually for athletes like Stef. ""I loved the bladed mannequins, and I wish 15-year-old Stef had seen those. ""But now I want retailers to match their inclusive imagery with the actual buying experience"". Stef isn't alone. While she wears two shoes with her day-to-day prosthetic, many other amputees don't. And beyond disability, thousands of people whose feet are different sizes are also affected by having to buy two shoes of the same size rather than two singles. Stef Reid Stef says global sports brands are yet to match their inclusive marketing with useful action for amputees needing single shoes Nike launched a single shoe programme last year, letting customers buy one shoe at half price at select stores. However this is not clearly advertised, requires the customer to contact the care support team and is not available online. When Stef raised the issue, she was not pointed to the scheme but instead offered a one-time 15% discount. ""That's not much use in the long term, as I'm always going to have one foot"". BBC Morning Live In recent years, shops have incorporated disability into their marketing, prominently featuring mannequins wearing running blades Adidas, which equip the British Paralympic team, also do not sell single shoes online. However they say it is possible to buy a single shoe in some stores, depending on stock. The company added it is in the ""advanced stages"" of finalising a comprehensive policy. Puma meanwhile, does not sell any single shoes in store or online and, like Decathlon, did not respond to a request for comment. While Nike and Adidas have made positive steps towards addressing the issue, Stef thinks sports brands should sell single shoes at all their shops and online as standard practice. Small steps Some smaller businesses and grassroots organisations are already proving it is possible. Other stories you may enjoy High street footwear company Schuh sells single shoes for half the price of a pair, while shoe chain Office also allows you to buy odd sized pairs of shoes through their outlet site. And then there's small scale solutions such as Jo's Odd Shoes, founded by Jo O'Callaghan who lost her right leg to complex regional pain syndrome. The condition makes it too painful to wear a prosthetic limb, leaving her, like many amputees, only needing one of a pair of shoes. She set up a Facebook Group where members could swap or donate spare shoes. Many retailers also donate shoes to the scheme. The items are free for members, aside from a small fee for postage and packaging. BBC Morning Live Jo, seen dealing with online orders, says her initiative offers her peace of mind in knowing that shoes will not go to waste It's a service that air sport athlete Jack Pimblett has benefited from. Born with talipes, or club foot, which stunted the growth of his right foot and leg, he struggled to find two shoes which fitted well when he was younger. He often had to put cotton wool in his shoes to fill the extra space. As an adult, he manages by buying a combination of junior and adult shoe sizes - buying a right shoe in size 5 and a left shoe in size 7. But this imposes a significant financial strain, with Jack typically spending around £150 for two pairs of shoes. ""It would be nice to be able to buy shoes that fit… [without] paying twice,"" he says. Stef acknowledges the change she's calling for takes time and money, but urges firms to push forward. ""All it takes is that first step forward in the right direction,"" she says.

9c210f076e68,What we know about rising autism rates and Trump's unproven Tylenol link,,"What we know about rising autism rates and Trump's unproven Tylenol link Getty Images US President Donald Trump has claimed there is a link between the use of painkiller Tylenol by pregnant women and an increased risk of autism in some children. Going against current scientific advice and medical opinion, he said the drug, known as paracetamol in many countries, ""is no good"" and women should ""fight like hell"" to only take it in extreme cases, such as for high fevers. Medical bodies say the drug is safe and that it remains the best treatment for pain and fever during pregnancy. What is autism and how is it diagnosed? Autism is a form of lifelong neurodivergence and disability that affects how people experience and interact with the world. It is a spectrum, meaning it includes a wide range of characteristics which vary from person to person. It can include those with high support needs who are non-speaking, and those with above-average intelligence who might struggle with social interaction or communication. Some autistic people may have intense interests, prefer order and routine, and use repeated movements or actions to calm themselves or express joy. Autism is not a learning disability or a mental health condition. However, the UK National Autistic Society says around a third of autistic people also have a learning disability, and rates of mental health problems are higher. There is no blood test or brain scan to determine who has autism. Instead, a diagnosis is based on a doctor's observations. How many people have autism? The number of children diagnosed with autism has risen sharply in many countries. In the US, one in 31 children were identified with autism in 2022, up from 1 in 149 in 2000. The rate for eight-year-old boys was significantly higher than for girls. In the UK, research published in the Lancet medical journal in 2023 found that one in 34 children aged 10 to 14 years old were diagnosed with autism (in 2018). Comparing autism rates for different countries is difficult. The way the figures are collected tends to change based on diagnostic practices, awareness levels, healthcare access and cultural differences. Research published in 2022 looked at 71 studies and found an average prevalence of around 1%. Numbers ranged from 0.075% in Bangladesh to 3.9% in Australia. Why have rates of autism been rising? While the number of people officially identified or diagnosed with autism has risen sharply, most researchers believe that this reflects increased awareness and changes to the way it is classified. For example, some people who have difficulty with social interaction and non-verbal communication were once told they had Asperger's Syndrome. But, in 2013, the diagnostic criteria of ASD – or Autism Spectrum Disorder – was broadened to include people with Asperger's Syndrome in the US. The same wider definition has been used in countries, including the UK, which saw an eight-fold rise in new autism diagnoses between 1998 and 2018 . A 2007 study in the UK found that as, long as the same criteria was being used, rates of autism were similar in adults and children. This supports the idea that it is more recognised today than in the past. However, US Health Secretary Robert Kennedy Jr has sharply criticised that view, describing it as ""epidemic denial"". At a news conference in April, he described autism as ""preventable"". He has previously offered several debunked theories about the causes, including blaming vaccines, despite a lack of evidence. Does Tylenol cause autism? Getty Images No, there is no evidence that Tylenol causes autism. Trump's comments have shocked many medical bodies, which recommend the drug for pain and fever during pregnancy. The widely held view of researchers worldwide is that there is no single cause of autism. It is thought to be the result of a complex mix of genetic and environmental factors. For scientists looking at the data, it is difficult to separate out the effects of one action, like taking a painkiller, from other factors such as parental health, genetics and environmental conditions. The Trump administration has cited some recent studies which have shown a potential association, which means the drug could increase the risk of autism in some children. But there may be other explanations for that link. In August, a team led by Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in the US analysed 46 older studies. Of these, 27 reported a link between the use of acetaminophen, the active ingredient in the painkiller, and an increased risk of neurodevelopmental disorders including autism and ADHD. Nine showed no significant link and four indicated an opposite, protective, effect. The authors said more work was needed to confirm their findings but recommended ""cautious, time-limited use"" of the painkiller during pregnancy. Another study, in 2024, analysed 2.5 million babies born in Sweden. It compared autistic children with their siblings to control for genetic factors, and found no evidence to support a causal link between autism and the use of the painkiller. And a Japanese study published earlier this year did not find meaningful evidence that acetaminophen use during pregnancy increases the risk of autism. The Autism Science Foundation, a US charity, says that based on existing data there is not enough evidence to support a link between Tylenol and autism. But it says that taking any medication during pregnancy should be approached with caution and medical advice should be sought. In a statement to the BBC, Tylenol maker Kenvue said the science clearly shows that taking acetaminophen does not cause autism. ""We strongly disagree with any suggestion otherwise and are deeply concerned with the health risk this poses for expecting mothers."" What is the advice on pain relief in pregnancy? Acetaminophen, or paracetamol, is the recommended first-line medication for pain and fever during pregnancy by the American College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, the UK's Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, and other medical organisations worldwide. There is some evidence that high fevers during pregnancy, particularly during the first trimester, can harm the baby, with a higher risk of miscarriage, preterm birth, or birth defects called NTDs, or neural tube defects. Following Trump's announcement, health officials stressed that paracetamol remains the safest painkiller available to pregnant women. UK Health Secretary Wes Streeting said: ""I trust doctors over President Trump, frankly, on this."" As with any pain-relieving medicine, it should be used at the lowest effective dose, for the shortest possible time and as infrequently as possible. Ibuprofen is not usually recommended, unless it's prescribed by a doctor, especially if someone is more than 20 weeks pregnant, because it can affect the baby's circulation and kidney function. Paracetamol is considered to be one of the safest drugs in the world when taken at the correct dose. Like all medicines, there is an overdose risk if more than the recommended dose is taken. For adults, the usual dose is one or two 500mg tablets at a time, up to four times in 24 hours, according to the National Health Service (NHS) in the UK. It describes paracetamol as the ""first choice"" pain killer for women who are breastfeeding. What is folinic acid or leucovorin? Getty Images Pregnant women and those trying to conceive are advised to take folic acid - the synthetic version of the vitamin folate US Health Secretary Robert F Kennedy Jnr also signalled that a drug called leucovorin, normally given to cancer patients to reduce the side-effects of chemotherapy, would soon be approved as a treatment for children with autism. But researchers have cautioned that the science is still in the very early stages, and more work is needed before any firm conclusions can be reached. Folate, also known as vitamin B9, is found in many foods and helps the body form health red blood cells. The Autism Science Foundation says that low folate levels during early pregnancy have been linked in some studies to an increased risk of autism in children, though the findings are not consistent. Studies in Norway, the US and Israel found that mothers who took folic acid supplements around conception had children with a 30-70% lower likelihood of autism. Other studies did not find a significant association. The charity says the suggestion that folate may improve some symptoms comes from trials of a cancer drug known as leucovorin or folinic acid. Some research has shown that unlike regular folic acid, folinic acid can more easily cross the blood brain barrier and address a deficiency of the vitamin. Four small, randomised trials, all using different doses and measurements of success, have been carried out. One, from 2016, studied 48 autistic children in the US and found improvements in verbal communication compared with a placebo.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cpq51dry7wgo,Health,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/0b23/live/cc355f10-9854-11f0-8d62-215a8506b20f.jpg,2025-09-23T10:54:16.221000+00:00,a977dffb36b575aef9f99cfd91abe6d6e8dd46f0

But now he's curating a uniquely personal playlist - the songs of his own life to carry him through terminal illness. The list includes both November Rain and Sweet Child O' Mine by Guns N' Roses, Apache by The Shadows - which inspired Dave to play guitar - and Pink Floyd's Comfortably Numb. Hazel O'Connor's 1980 hit Will You? is dedicated to his wife and mother to their two children. An ode to tentative yet powerful romantic tension, it is known for its saxophone solo - an instrument Dave also learned to play. ""It's our tune from when we got together,"" Dave tells BBC's Morning Live, tapping his feet. As the song evokes memories, his wife Kate quietly adds ""the fight was worth it."" Kate Gilmore/BBC Morning Live Dave is curating a playlist of songs from throughout his life to carry him through terminal illness Moments like this emphasise the power of music to forge everlasting connection. Its therapeutic benefits are increasingly recognised in palliative and end of life care. The impact is neurological as well as emotional, explains Sarah Metcalfe, managing director of the Utley Foundation's Music for Dementia campaign. Brain activity scans show music ""lights up"" multiple parts of our brain, simultaneously touching physical and emotional sense centres. ""Even if one part of the brain is damaged, those other parts can still be accessed,"" Sarah says. Kate Gilmore Dave and Kate on their wedding day in 1986 UK charity Marie Curie surveyed 1,000 adults whose loved ones had received care in the final stages of life. It found listening to music together helped to create a shared experience that brought them closer, creating a sense of normality and helping them relax. Kate experienced this first hand. When Dave once returned home after a lengthy hospital stay, he was twitchy and exhausted but unable to sleep. Out of desperation she turned to Native American music, one of his favourite genres to relax to. Other stories you may enjoy ""And then all of a sudden, this agitated, anxious man began to sleep,"" she recalls. Diana Schad, a staff nurse at the Marie Curie hospice in Glasgow with 19 years of experience as well as a musician herself, has installed a piano for patients and volunteers to use. She says it is important to consider the feelings music evokes. ""You've always got to ask yourself, is this what they would like to be feeling at the moment?"" says Diana. How to make a good palliative playlist 1. Focus on music memories between ages 10-30, which is when the strongest associations are formed 2. Include songs connected to special, significant places and important life events - youth, holidays, romance, first dances and wedding songs 3. Consider feelings sparked by songs - these can be just as powerful as memory association 4. Remember that music can trigger memories even for people with conditions like dementia by connecting multiple brain regions. Use resources like BBC Music Memories to spark memory recall 5. Be open to unexpected musical connections, like TV show themes or commercial jingles that might hold special meaning Source: Music for Dementia's managing director, Sarah Metcalfe Marie Curie Diana, a musician in her spare time, says music plays a pivotal role in end-of-life care Experts agree that music can reduce anxiety and psychological pain, even when someone is unconscious. Dr Sam Murphy, senior lecturer at the Open University, specialises in thanatology, the study of death and the practices associated with it. ""There's certainly evidence to suggest that hearing is the last sense to go so even when someone is unconscious or unresponsive, music can still reach them,"" she says. ""It keeps them connected to their surroundings, to the people they love, and to the sense of being alive and those memories that they've had."" An everlasting comfort in death Music can be equally helpful to loved ones after a person has passed away. ""I think it's just another distraction for those people that are mourning a loved one,"" Dr Murphy says. ""But there's that comfort in knowing that they're listening to something that their loved one would have listened to over the years."" This is true for Anna-Kay Brocklesby, whose husband Ian passed away from prostate cancer in 2023. As Ian's health deteriorated, sharing his favourite songs became a crucial part of their family's coping mechanism. It became a way to keep spirits up and stay positive, says his wife. ""Every morning he would go down and make the tea, he would play. Oh, What a Beautiful Morning from the musical Oklahoma,"" she says. ""And he would belt it out. He used it as a sort of mindset of, this is how today's going to be"". They would play Frank Sinatra, Nat King Cole, and Elton John songs, which provided comfort and connection. Two years after Ian died, Anna-Kay still finds comfort in the music they shared together. ""He lives on in us in many, many ways,"" says Anna-Kay, ""but music can take us to a place with Ian"".

5d7c827d06d8,'My girl can't walk or talk': Searching for answers in Wales' rare disease cluster,,"'My girl can't walk or talk': Searching for answers in Wales' rare disease cluster Rachel Cowley found out that her daughter Jessica has DRPLA in May this year Rachel Cowley's daughter Jessica was like any other 10-year-old until she started having seizures. Now aged 20, Jessica is unable to walk or talk, and Ms Cowley fears she will die in the next few years. ""I hope when the time comes it is quick,"" said Ms Cowley. ""But I just don't think it's going to be."" Jessica is one of a ""cluster"" of people in south Wales affected by Dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy , or DRPLA, an inherited and progressive neurological disorder for which there is no known treatment or cure. DRPLA was believed to mainly affect people of Japanese origin and considered rare in the UK, until a 2007 research study found a relatively high prevalence of the condition in Wales. The symptoms of DRPLA can vary significantly, but generally include progressive memory loss and personality change, impaired control of body movements, muscle spasms, seizures and psychiatric disturbances. It is caused by a gene defect, and a person with the condition has a 50% chance of passing it on to a child of their own. Dr Mark Wardle, a consultant neurologist who authored the 2007 study, said there were a number of ""common founders"" with DRPLA in south Wales which had resulted in the current ""cluster of patients in their 20s or 30s"". ""It doesn't take many generations to have very many more cases just from the most common founders,"" he added. Rachel Cowley Jessica has lost the ability to walk and talk as a result of DRPLA Ms Cowley said Jessica was initially diagnosed with epilepsy aged 10, when she began having seizures. ""We could never control it,"" said Ms Cowley, 45, from Pontypridd, Rhondda Cynon Taf. But when Jessica turned 13, Ms Cowley said her daughter's legs began to ""give way"". The teenager, who previously loved doing gymnastics and horse riding, was now struggling to walk. ""I noticed that she could hardly walk up the stairs,"" said Ms Cowley. ""When she lost her voice, I just thought, these ain't signs of epilepsy, there's got to be something else."" After ""years of wondering"" why her health was deteriorating, Jessica was diagnosed with DRPLA in May. Rachel Cowley Jessica was ten when she started to have seizures Jessica now uses a wheelchair and is completely non-verbal. ""It's quite scary because she's been going through this for the last five to seven years,"" said Ms Cowley. ""I would speak to the consultant and they just did not know why she was deteriorating like she was. ""I think it's because of this disease being so rare."" Ms Cowley is part of a group called DRPLA in south Wales on Facebook, which currently has more than 100 members. Ms Cowley said it was a ""massive surprise"" to find other people in her area were facing the same challenges. ""We're all connected in a way,"" she said. ""It's nice to talk to some of them and have advice off them, because if I phone the GP, they don't know nothing about it."" Rachel Cowley, Zoe Hoes, Emma Davies and Zoe Lock all met in the DRPLA south Wales group Zoe Hoes adopted her eight-year-old daughter Gabriella when she was a baby. Last year, she was contacted by social services who said that a member of Gabriella's birth family had tested positive for DRPLA. Ms Hoes, 47, from Cwmbran, Torfaen, noticed her daughter was twitching at night and thought she might have symptoms. ""I managed to get a private test done and that confirmed that she did have it,"" Ms Hoes added. She said she was left ""scrambling to find out information"" about the condition. ""It's terrible because at the moment there is no treatment and no cure. ""You love them so much and you don't want to lose them."" Ms Hoes said the private test cost her ""in the region of £2,000"" which she acknowledged was unaffordable for many. ""A lot of families haven't got that money to spend,"" she said. ""So they just carry on with their lives, and anyone's child could meet someone with [DRPLA] and end up being a carer for their partner and children."" Zoe Hoes Zoe Hoes says it is ""heartbreaking"" thinking about her daughter's future with DRPLA Ms Hoes would like to see more people being tested for the condition at a younger age. ""[Parents] need to be able to make plans for those children's futures because, ultimately, they're going to be caring for them,"" she said. Dr Wardle began his research study into the DRPLA prevalence in south Wales after finding ""several families"" with the condition. He said the DRPLA gene, also known as the ATN1 gene, was crucial in understanding the disorder. If the gene expands in a large way ""over multiple generations"" a person will ""probably have a more aggressive disease than [their] parent"", explained Dr Wardle. He said the current generation of DRPLA patients had, in this way, experienced ""more severe disease"". ""That's why it feels as if we've suddenly got more patients,"" he said. ""When I first found patients with this disease in south Wales, they were in their 50s or 60s. ""Now we've got a cluster of patients in their 20s or 30s and that's why we're seeing that difference."" Symptoms can vary amongst patients depending on the age at which the condition first appears Dr Wardle said it was ""very difficult"" to diagnose DRPLA because it was ""astonishingly rare"" compared to similar conditions like epilepsy. ""Unless you've got a family history, people aren't even going to consider it,"" he added. He said raising awareness about DRPLA was a ""really good thing"" as it would make people think about it earlier. ""Getting good access to neurological services and genetic testing is really important to push this forward,"" he added. But Dr Wardle said there were ""moral and ethical issues"" with testing people under the age of 18. He said people needed to be mature enough to ""understand the consequences"" of being tested for the ""life-changing"" condition. ""You can't do that if you're six or 12-years-old. ""I know of one patient who has been devastated by being screened for this disease,"" he added. Clinical trial 'hope' Dr Wardle said it would be ""very different"" if there was treatment available. ""I think we'd change our approach because we want to identify those patients early. ""But that would be on the basis of early access to treatment, which we don't have at the moment."" The families affected in Wales said that clinical trials in the US for a potential treatment were providing ""hope"". But Dr Wardle said these trials could ""potentially"" cause more harm to families by ""raising expectations"". ""There's a pipeline where you've got to prove safety and then prove efficacy, and you've got to do that right,"" he said. Silvia Prades Dr Prades says there have been positive developments in trials taking place in the US Dr Silvia Prades is a research manager at the charity Ataxia UK and CureDRPLA. She is currently working with a team based in the US who are trialling a treatment on two people living with DRPLA. She said the early results had been positive with one of the people on the trial, a teenage boy, showing signs of improvement. ""He's now able to walk a few steps without assistance. He has regained some small movement in his hands and his speech is a bit clearer,"" she said. The second patient, a woman in her 30s, was more advanced in the condition and Dr Prades said any improvement had been ""less obvious"". She said the treatment effects could ""vary"" but felt the results were ""encouraging"". Dr Prades said she understood why people wanted testing at an earlier age but stressed that it was a ""personal choice"". ""Some people will feel empowered by having this knowledge. Others feel a huge burden,"" she said. Dr Prades said a ""combination of many different factors"" might explain why DRPLA prevalence appeared to be higher in south Wales than the rest of the UK. ""Perhaps it is the access to genetic testing has improved. It could also be that people are more aware of the condition,"" she said. ""It could also be that the stigma on genetic conditions is being removed."" She said there had been an ""increase"" in the number of families ""engaging"" with her team in recent times, which could be because people are experiencing the symptoms of DRPLA at an earlier age.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn0qqvyrdkwo,Health,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/3776/live/43fc4560-978b-11f0-9cf6-cbf3e73ce2b9.jpg,2025-09-22T04:58:54.630000+00:00,95be4ea3851327871f7a11ed545193c09f015f4e
9b49313fda50,"How to avoid period leaks - the pros and cons of cups, pants and tampons",,"How to avoid period leaks - the pros and cons of cups, pants and tampons Getty Images Finding the right period product for you can be a difficult task For many of us, our first lessons about periods were brief and practical, often limited to learning how to use pads or tampons. Alongside these traditional options, there's now a wider range of products available, including reusable options such as menstrual cups, period pants and washable pads. Making the choice about which one is best for you can be overwhelming. You might wonder how these products work and whether they're foolproof enough to put the fear of bleeding through your clothes at bay. Dr Tempest, a consultant gynaecologist at the University of Liverpool, spoke to Radio 4's Sliced Bread about how each product works and the pros and cons to help you decide which might suit you best. Menstrual cup Getty Images Menstrual cups are small flexible cups made of medical-grade silicone. You fold and insert them into the vagina, where they collect blood rather than absorbing it. Dr Tempest says there are different types of cups available to buy based on how heavy your flow is or whether you've had children. Hygiene is also really important so make sure you wash your hands before you insert the cup and clean the cup between uses, she adds. Pros The most eco-friendly period product Holds up to three times more blood than a tampon Can be worn for up to 12 hours Reusable for years - they can last up to 10 years but between two and four years is the average Cost effective over time Cons Takes practice to insert and remove May take time to find the right fit Messy to empty, especially in a public toilet Needs sterilising between cycles Larger upfront cost which can be around £20 to £25 Period pants Getty Images Period pants are underwear with built-in absorbent layers. You wear them like normal pants then rinse, wash and dry them for reuse. They're particularly popular for sleeping or on lighter days. Leakage worries are normal but Dr Tempest says they are reliable for most people and have a built-in waterproof layer and odour lining. Pros Looks and feels like regular underwear No shifting around and last between six and eight hours Reusable and eco-friendly - they last between two and three years Can be layered with other products for extra protections Cons Can have an expensive upfront cost - prices start from around £10 and go up to £50 Requires washing and drying between uses May not be absorbent enough for heavy flows Inconvenient for travel without access to laundry Will need to carry a used pair home with you if changing them during the day Reusable pads Getty Images Reusable pads look similar to disposable ones but are usually made from cotton or bamboo and fasten around your underwear with poppers. Instead of throwing them away, you rinse, wash and dry them to use again. Pros Softer and more comfortable to wear than plastic-based pads Eco-friendly so popular if you're wanting a more sustainable option Variety of sizes and absorbencies Cost effective over time Can last between three and five years Cons Need to be washed after each use Requires planning - they must be dried properly between uses says Dr Tempest as damp fabric against your skin can increase the risk of infection Bulkier than disposable pads Less convenient if you're out of the house as you'll need to carry the used ones home with you Disposable Pads Getty Images Disposable sanitary pads are the most commonly used period product - they stick into your underwear, absorb blood externally and are wrapped and binned after use. Dr Tempest advises changing pads regularly (every four to six hours) and they shouldn't be worn for more than eight hours as they can irritate the skin if worn for too long. Pros Simple to use Widely available in many different sizes from ultra-thin to thick night pads Good for overnight protection Can be more comfortable for beginners Cons Can feel bulky or shift out of place Not practical for water-based sports, such as swimming Environmentally harmful - an average pack of pads holds the same amount of plastic as five carrier bags according to Dr Tempest More expensive than reusable options over time - women spend around £5,000 on period products over a lifetime Tampons Getty Images Tampons are also commonly used and inserted into the vagina, where they soak up blood before it leaves the body. Dr Tempest stresses that they must be correctly disposed of. Every day, 2.5 million tampons are flushed down the toilet when they should be placed in a bin.

Shredded. Jacked. Swole. Which are you? Gym jargon such as this, which refers to the size and definition of muscles, has long been heard exchanged between pumped men in gym locker rooms - and now among teenagers too. TikTok videos show boys as young as 13 and 14 in school toilets, flexing veiny biceps which bulge out of their school uniforms. The quest for brick-like abs has become serious business - even if you're still only in Year 8 - with posts on socials with hashtags like #shreddedphysique being viewed more than four billion times. The desire to get this look, for many, might mean doing a few deadlifts and drinking a protein shake from time to time. For others, it could be working out a few times a week, playing sport and eating a lot of chicken. But for a growing few it means going to the gym most nights, often following intense training regimes from social media, and learning how to ""cut and bulk"". The cut and bulk cycle consists of eating hundreds of calories more than your recommended daily intake to get bigger, retaining some fat in the process, then several weeks later cutting calorie intake down to lose the fat for a leaner, more defined look. It can be all-consuming, and involves a lot of calorie counting, working out and dedication. Some sports nutritionists say it can be harmful - affecting hormone health, growth, and development, and could potentially lead to problems with eating disorders such as muscle dysmorphia - the idea your body is smaller and less muscly than it actually is. I've spoken to three teenagers, who all share a love of the gym, about what is driving them to get ripped this way. The 14-year-old body builder George Holland George started going the gym when he was aged 11, lifting no more than 10kg When George Holland first walked on stage he thought he might feel nervous. The 14-year-old was by far the youngest contestant in the under-19s category of the National Amateur Body-Builders' Association finals. Wearing fake tan and a pair of small trunks, it might have felt a bit exposing to start flexing his muscles before an audience of hundreds - but, George says, ""I had practised everything and I knew there was nothing to be worried about."" He went on to win the bronze medal. George joined a gym when he was 11, having watched some of the bodybuilding greats online who inspired him to give it a go. In the early days, he explains, he would work on each muscle group twice a week, lifting no more than 10kg - the heaviest permitted for a child under 16 at his local leisure centre. But, after changing gyms, for a ""proper gym vibe"", he says, he could start to increase the load, working out alongside 20-30-year-olds. George Holland George was the youngest contestant in the under-19s category of the National Amateur Body-Builders' Association finals After seeking out more experienced men from whom to learn, George is now coached by a former Mr Universe, Eddie Ellwood. He's bench-pressing 140kg, squatting 180kg, and deadlifting 200kg. His drive, he says, comes from looking at others in the gym and wanting to be as big as them. George eats six meals a day, goes to school, trains hard (four days on, one day off, four days on) and posts to his 140,000 followers on TikTok and Instagram. He's currently in a ""bulking"" stage, he explains, consuming around 4,100 calories a day. After 16 weeks, he will start to cut, gradually reducing his calorie intake to 2,200 a day. When I ask if he's worried about the intensity of his fitness regime and the desire to look big at such a young age, he's very clear: ""I completely disagree with that, going to the gym when you are young is dead good for you. ""It's good for your mental health, your overall fitness, and it gives you good discipline."" 'You can't cheat getting bigger' George Hazard was 12 when he started working out. That was during lockdown and his home gym consisted of a pull-up bar, a few weights, and a plastic bench in his garage. Now 17, he says going to the gym has become a bit of an addiction - he's there five or six nights a week - and along with his mates, he bulks out and cuts back. George feels it's helped him stay mobile since recovering from a leg-lengthening operation where a nail was put through his femur bone, after he was born with one leg shorter than the other. He says you can get ""fountains of knowledge"" from social media, especially around optimal muscle growth. George Hazard George first started working out at home, in a home gym, during lockdown But how do you distinguish between well-tested, science-based recommendations and other, less informed suggestions, I ask him? ""Once you've spent a good few hours on TikTok for example, you get a feeling for what is a load of rubbish and what is good stuff,"" George replies. ""For a start - the decent ones put links to studies alongside their content."" He says you can work out and eat well, but it can be difficult being so young because you ""can't stick to a strict diet and tell your parents exactly what they have to make for tea"". George does eat lot of chicken, has several eggs for breakfast, and says his grandma is very good at giving him a high protein diet. There is a movement of young people who are interested in health, fitness and working out, he says, and he feels that's no bad thing. ""You work hard and see the results,"" George says. ""You can't really cheat getting bigger."" The former 'dirty bulker' Nat Wolny Nat often cuts and bulks to get a more defined look Seeing his uncle powerlifting spurred Nat Wolny into working out aged 12 - and he's loved the gym since ""day one"". Between the ages of 13 and 16, he tried ""dirty bulking"" - a process of eating huge amounts of food to get big. The more he worked out, the bigger he grew. But it became unsustainable. Nat, who is now 18, says he was eating 80% junk, 20% nutritious food and while he might have looked jacked on the outside, on the inside his ""gut was a mess"". ""I had really bad acne and I felt really self-conscious."" He tried cutting out fast food and other ultra-processed foods, then he found the carnivore diet and began to fast. The carnivore diet does not come without risks, but Nat is adamant it works for him. The 18-year-old shows me the main foods that that he eats: raw steak, eggs and raw milk. ""It's an ancestral diet,"" Nat says, ""which is what we survived off - it's primal."" Ruth Clegg, BBC Nat follows a raw food diet which consists of eggs, raw milk and raw meat Nat fasts for 20 hours a day, to improve his mental clarity, he says. His family have always been supportive of his choices, but even they have found it difficult to adjust to his regime. Some studies suggest intermittent fasting can have some positive effects as an adult, but it can be harmful for teenagers because they still need fuel for growth. Nat says he had a ""spiritual awakening"" after fasting for a week - using ChatGPT for advice and guidance. Fasting for more than three days can have an impact on major organs . Using AI bots to help devise fitness plans is something many do, but they should be used with caution - the quality of the information they provide is variable and may not have any credible evidence behind it. What's his endgame I ask Nat, surely this kind of lifestyle is difficult to maintain? He wants to promote his way of life online, to ""help others"" he says. ""I'll keep going for as long as I can. I have recently read something that does not recommend fasting, so if I start to feel bad, then I can just change my diet."" Where does this go next? All the experts I've spoken to agree there's nothing wrong with the desire to be fit and healthy, especially from a young age. But what does that mean? Is ""fit and healthy"" becoming increasingly wrapped up in a tight torso and sculpted pecs? ""Too often, it's about the look, rather than what healthy really means, which comes in all shapes and sizes,"" children's dietician Lucy Upton explains. She says this growing trend is not only pushing some teenagers to extremes, the advice online on how to achieve it often lacks credible evidence. ""Sometimes content [on socials, for example] can nod to a scientific truth, but when examined that 'truth' is in a completely different context,"" says Ms Upton. In the first instance, she recommends looking more closely at the person posting the content - thinking about whether it's coming from personal experience or a clinical background, and whether it applies to your own situation. ""And if someone is trying to sell something they are endorsing - then that's a big red flag."" Meanwhile, Sam Grady-Graham, a GB Boxing coach, says following restrictive eating regimes in your teens is potentially harmful. He says the rate of growth between 12 and 18 is ""exponential"", so the body needs a full and nutritious diet to fuel it. Foodwise that's a balanced, holistic diet from the main food groups - fruit, vegetables, grains, proteins and dairy - and not going to extremes. When it comes to working out, and varying levels of intensity, he says don't go too hard too quickly. ""Movement over muscle is the way we look at it,"" he says. ""Get the movement right when you're lifting. You might not see progress immediately, but long term, you set yourself a strong foundation to build upon.""",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvg964v18l6o,Health,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/334c/live/195bb090-8fb4-11f0-9cf6-cbf3e73ce2b9.jpg,2025-09-14T05:06:27.959000+00:00,78ba4ccadf8a7a900c37da75f9877bba48e0950f
4cff0712c7b6,Why the world is watching RFK's fight with US health agency,,"Why the world is watching RFK's fight with US health agency AP In fiery Senate testimony this week, US Health Secretary Robert Kennedy Jr once again set his sights on the nation's top public health agency, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). His appearance came days after he suddenly fired the new CDC director, Susan Monarez, provoking a group of senior staff to resign in protest. At the hearing, when asked for an explanation, Kennedy claimed he had asked Ms Monarez if she was a ""trustworthy person"" and she had replied ""no"", to some disbelief from his opponents in the room. He then admitted he had once described the CDC as the ""most corrupt"" agency in government, and strongly hinted he's not finished with his plans to shake up the organisation. Kennedy's words have sparked a furious backlash, with many doctors and scientists increasingly concerned that America's public health systems are being dangerously compromised. It's a conflict that could have a significant impact not just on health policy in the US but across the world. In the past, the CDC has been instrumental in global health, leading the response to crises from famine, to HIV, to Ebola. Founded in 1946, the CDC tracks emerging infectious diseases like Covid and is also tasked with tackling long-term or chronic conditions such as heart disease and cancer. It operates more than 200 specialised laboratories and employs 13,000 people, although that number has been cut by around 2,000 since President Donald Trump returned to office. It does not approve or licence vaccines. That responsibility lies with the Food and Drug Administration. But it does produce official recommendations on who should receive which vaccines through a panel of experts - known as the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) - and monitors their side effects and other safety concerns. Vaccine dispute Politico AP It was Kennedy's record on vaccines which particularly worried many public health experts when he took office in February. An activist group he ran for eight years, Children's Health Defense, repeatedly questioned the safety and efficacy of vaccination. He has described the Covid jab as the ""most deadly in history"" and has blamed rising rates of autism on vaccines, an idea that has been categorically debunked by large scientific studies over many years. So feathers were seriously ruffled just weeks into his tenure when it emerged he had hired a noted vaccine critic, David Geier, to look again at the CDC data on that scientifically disproven link. Then in June, Kennedy suddenly sacked the entire ACIP panel which advises the CDC on vaccine eligibility after accusing all 17 members of being ""plagued with persistent conflicts of interest"". A new committee, handpicked by the administration, now has the power to change, or even drop, critical recommendations to immunise Americans for certain diseases, as well as shape the childhood vaccination programme, although the CDC itself still has the final say on whether to accept that advice. It's that decision which has now been linked to the firing of the agency's new director in late August, only 29 days into the job. In a newspaper article this week Ms Monarez said she was sacked from the CDC after being told, by Kennedy, to ""pre-approve"" the recommendations of the ACIP committee which she said had now been filled with people who have expressed ""antivaccine rhetoric"". ""It is imperative that the panel's recommendations aren't rubber-stamped but instead are rigorously and scientifically reviewed before being accepted or rejected,"" she wrote. ""I lost my job, America's children could lose far more."" In his testimony Kennedy stood his ground, accusing her of lying about that exchange and describing her dismissal as ""absolutely necessary"". ""We need bold, competent and creative new leadership at CDC, people able and willing to chart a new course,"" he said. Ms Monarez's sacking led to a fresh wave of resignations at the agency as senior staff continue to walk out. Over the last two weeks the CDC has lost its chief medical officer, its director of immunisation and its director of emerging diseases, amongst others. ""A huge top tier of CDC leadership has been removed, but this is also in the wake of the firing of thousands of CDC workers, including many well-respected experts,"" says Dr Fiona Havers, a senior vaccine researcher who herself resigned from the agency in June. ""I'm a physician, and for my own integrity as a scientist, I did not feel I could continue to serve in that administration when it felt like the data we were putting together was not going to be used in an evidenced, science-based way."" Kennedy was also criticised by some CDC staff for what they felt was a lacklustre response to a shooting at the agency's Atlanta headquarters in August. The gunman, who reportedly believed the Covid vaccine had made him sick, killed a policeman before turning the weapon on himself . Kennedy visited the offices in the aftermath but he did not meet with staff members and continued to criticise the agency's performance. He did, though, start his testimony this week with a tribute to David Rose, the police officer who died in the shooting. For the moment, Jim O'Neill, one of Kennedy's top advisers, has been tapped up to run the CDC on an interim basis, until a new permanent director can be found. Mr O'Neill served in several roles in the health department under President George W Bush, but he has a business rather than a science background. ""During the previous administration, CDC lost public trust by manipulating health data to support a political narrative,"" he wrote on social media on the day he was appointed. ""We are helping the agency earn back the trust it has squandered."" More changes are certainly likely. In his Senate hearing Kennedy said the CDC had lied to Americans in the pandemic about mask wearing, social distancing and the ability of the vaccine to stop the transmission of coronavirus. ""I need to fire some of those people and make sure this doesn't happen again,"" he said. Global repercussions The next flashpoint could come later this month. On 18 September the CDC's new vaccine advisory panel is due to meet to discuss Covid vaccines and other shots, including for hepatitis B and the RSV virus. The panel's recommendations and the CDC's response will be carefully scrutinised, not just in the US but around the world. ""What happens in America is of great importance,"" says Anthony Costello, a former director at the World Health Organization (WHO) and a professor of public health at University College London. ""We've done so much to protect science from political interference over the past 200 years and the concern is that America will pay a price for it and we might too, if we go in that direction."" In the past, CDC teams have also had a major hands-on role in global health protection. In 2015, for example, the agency had 3,000 staff working on the Ebola outbreak in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia, with 1,200 of those on the ground in west Africa. After taking office, President Trump withdrew the US from the WHO and ordered the CDC to cut off all communication with the organisation. The concern from former CDC staffers like Dr Fiona Havers  is what might happen if and when the next Ebola or Covid is eventually spotted and starts spreading. ""Taking a sledgehammer to the CDC and undercutting its programmes has left the US much less prepared for another pandemic,” she says. “And that really has huge implications globally if another health emergency were to arise.”",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c62ngkpxk9lo,Health,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/5db9/live/054073e0-8a67-11f0-b758-393fbf15c843.jpg,2025-09-06T00:24:45.238000+00:00,f897de9b689581f3418f758e44094b09f5a39f81
8e09e44a10e0,The trade in US body parts that's completely legal - but ripe for exploitation,,"The trade in US body parts that's completely legal - but ripe for exploitation Luke Mintz BBC News BBC Harold Dillard was 56 when he was diagnosed with an aggressive cancer around his abdomen in November 2009. Within weeks the former car mechanic and handyman - a Texan ""Mr Fix It"" type who wore a cowboy hat and jeans nearly every day - was in end-of-life hospice care. In his final days, Mr Dillard was visited at the hospice by a company called Bio Care. They asked if he might like to donate his body to medical science, where it could be used by doctors to practise knee replacement surgery. The company would cremate the parts of his body that weren't used and return his ashes free of charge. ""His eyes lit up,"" his daughter, Farrah Fasold, remembers. ""He viewed that as lessening the burden on his family. Donating his body was the last selfless thing he could do."" Mr Dillard died on Christmas Eve, and within hours, a car from Bio Care pulled up outside the hospice and drove his body away. A few months later, his daughter received a call from the police. They had found her father's head. Harold Dillard's body was ""mutilated"", his daughter Farrah Fasold says At the company's warehouse, police say they found more than 100 body parts belonging to 45 people. ""All of the bodies appeared to have been dismembered by a coarse cutting instrument, such as a chainsaw,"" a detective wrote at the time. Ms Fasold says she imagined her father's body would be handled with respect - but instead it was ""mutilated"", she believes. ""I would close my eyes at night and see huge red tubs filled with body parts. I had insomnia. I wasn't sleeping."" The company said at the time through a lawyer that they denied mistreating bodies. The firm no longer exists, and its former owners could not be reached for comment. This was Ms Fasold's first introduction to the world of so-called body brokers: private companies that acquire corpses, dissect them, and then sell the limbs for a profit, often to medical research centres. For critics, the industry represents a modern form of grave-robbing. Others argue that body-donation is essential for medical research and that private companies are simply filling a gap left by universities, who consistently fail to acquire enough dead bodies to support their education and research programmes. Although Ms Fasold didn't realise it at the time, her father's case sheds light on an emotion-fuelled debate that cuts to the centre of our ideas about life, and what it means to have a dignified death. The body business Since at least the 19th Century, when the teaching of medicine expanded, some scientifically-minded people have rather liked the idea that their corpse could be used to train doctors. Brandi Schmitt is director of the anatomical donation programme at the University of California, a popular destination for people wishing to bequeath their bodies. She says last year they received 1,600 ""whole-body donations"", and they have a list of almost 50,000 living people who have already registered to do so. Often, body-donation is driven by simple altruism, she says: ""A  lot of people are either educated or interested in education."" But financial factors come into play too. Funerals are expensive, Ms Schmitt says; many are tempted by the prospect of their body being taken away for free. The Body Shop Conversations with body brokers, scientists and affected families shed light on this murky industry. Listen on BBC Sounds or on BBC Radio 4 at 13:30 BST on Sunday 31 August. Produced by Jacob Dabb and 2 Degrees West. Like most medical schools, the University of California does not profit from its body-donation programme, and it has strict guidelines for how corpses - or cadavers, as they are known medically - should be handled. But in recent decades, something more controversial has emerged in the US: a network of for-profit businesses that act as middlemen, acquiring bodies from individuals, dissecting them, and then selling them on. They are widely nicknamed body brokers,  though the firms call themselves ""non-transplant tissue banks"". Some of their customers are universities, which use cadavers to train doctors. Others are medical engineering firms, which use limbs to test products like new hip implants. The for-profit body part trade is effectively outlawed in the UK and other European countries, but looser regulation in the US has allowed the trade to flourish. The largest investigation of its kind - conducted by Reuters journalist Brian Grow, in 2017 - identified 25 for-profit body broking companies in the US. One of them earned $12.5m (£9.3m) over three years from the body-part business. Some of those firms are broadly respected, and claim to follow rigorous ethical guidelines. Others have been accused of disrespecting the dead and exploiting vulnerable people in grief. A global trade The trade has grown because of a gap in US regulation, says Jenny Kleeman, who spent years researching the topic for her book, The Price of Life. Whilst the UK's Human Tissue Act makes it illegal in almost all cases to profit from a body part, no comparable law exists in the US. Technically, the US's Uniform Anatomical Gift Act bans the sale of human tissue - but the same law allows you to charge a ""reasonable amount"" for the ""processing"" of a body part. These loose laws have turned the US into a global exporter of cadavers. In her book, Kleeman found that one of the largest US players shipped body parts to more than 50 countries, including the UK. ""In many countries, there is a shortfall of donations,"" Ms Kleeman says. ""And where they can get bodies is from America."" There is no formal register of brokers, and official statistics are hard to find. But Reuters calculated that, from 2011 to 2015, private brokers in the US received at least 50,000 bodies, and distributed more than 182,000 body parts. 'Bodies of the state' For some, private body brokers represent the very worst sort of ambulance-chasing greed. In his Reuters investigation, Mr Grow found cases of brokers becoming ""intertwined with the American funeral industry"" via arrangements in which funeral homes introduce brokers to relatives of the recently-deceased. In return, the home received a referral fee, sometimes exceeding $1,000 (£750). Horror stories are easy to find - and because of the US's light regulation, there's often no legal recourse when things go wrong. After her run-in with Bio Care, Ms Fasold hoped for a criminal prosecution. As well as the fact that her father's limbs may have been cut with a chainsaw, she was unhappy about a package she had received in the post, in a zip-lock bag, which the company claimed was her father's ashes. She says the contents did not look or feel like human ashes. Harold Dillard was a classic Texan ""cowboy"", his daughter says. She was told the company that handled her father's remains had not broken any state laws Bio Care's owner was initially charged with fraud, but the charge was later withdrawn because prosecutors could not prove an intent to deceive. Increasingly desperate, Ms Fasold contacted the local district prosecutor. But she was told that Bio Care had not broken any state criminal laws. Equally as controversial are ""bodies of the state"" donations - when a homeless person dies on the street, or somebody dies in hospital without known next-of-kin, and their corpse is donated to science. In theory, county officials first try to find relatives; only if they cannot locate anyone is the body given away. But the BBC has heard that this may not always happen. Last year, Tim Leggett was scrolling a news app at his home in Texas when he found a list of local people whose bodies had been used in this way. He was shocked to see the name of his older brother, Dale, a forklift truck-operator who had died of respiratory failure a year earlier. His brother's body was used by a for-profit medical education company to train anaesthesiologists. It was one of more than 2,000 unclaimed bodies given to the University of North Texas Health Science Center between 2019 and 2024, under agreements with the Dallas and Tarrant counties. ""I was angry,"" Mr Leggett says. ""He would not want to be an object of discussion, or [to have] people pointing at him."" His brother was a quiet man who mostly ""just wanted to be left alone"", Mr Leggett remembers, and his aversion to technology made it difficult to stay in touch. Still, Mr Leggett says his brother was a human, like anyone else, who deserved dignity in death. ""He liked Marvel comic books; he had a cat that he named Cat,"" he remembers. In a statement to the BBC, the University of North Texas Health Science Center gave its ""deepest apologies"" to the affected families, and said it was ""refocusing"" its programme on education and ""improv[ing] the quality of health for families and future generations"". Since the story first emerged last year, they said, they have fired staff who oversaw the programme. Unfairly villainised? But horror stories like these aside, others point out that body donation plays a crucial role in scientific discovery. Ms Schmitt of the University of California says that at the most basic level, bodies are used to teach doctors, or for surgeons to practise complicated operations. Often, it's the first time a medical student works with real flesh and blood - an experience that can't be replicated from a textbook. ""Those students will go on to help people,"" she says. Then there are the cadavers used to help engineer new treatments. Ms Schmitt points to a number of technologies that were only developed, she says, after being tested on bodies. These include knee and hip replacements, robotic surgery, and pacemakers. Bloomberg via Getty Images For many medical students, practising on a dead body is the first time they work with real flesh and blood And some of the private brokers say they are being unfairly villainised. Kevin Lowbrera, who works for one of the big ""body broking"" companies, says its accreditation by the American Association of Tissue Banks means it has to follow guidelines determining how cadavers are treated and stored. Accreditation is voluntary - seven companies have signed up - and a private broker doesn't need it to operate legally. The problem is not with honest companies like his, Mr Lowbrera says - it is with the rogue players. ""There are still programmes out there that are not accredited. I tell people all the time, stay away from them,"" he says. It would be wrong to regulate his whole industry out of existence, he says, because of some bad apples. Beyond the for-profit trade? Virtually everyone I speak to - on all sides of the debate - thinks that more regulation in the US is needed. So, what could that look like? Ms Schmitt, of the University of California, suggests the US could perhaps follow European countries and ban for-profit body broking. She says there are some ""legitimate costs"" that come with processing a body - like spending on transport, and preservative chemicals. It's reasonable for companies to charge for these, she says. But the idea of actually making a profit makes many feel squeamish. ""The ability to sell or profit from human remains I think complicates the altruistic idea of donating for education,"" she says. She suggests the US could emulate its own policy on organ donation - which is governed by the Uniform Anatomical Gift Act, and prohibits the sale of organs. But the author Ms Kleeman says that if the US banned for-profit body donation tomorrow, there simply wouldn't be enough cadavers to go around. ""If you don't want there to be a trade in these body parts, we need to get a way of more people donating altruistically,"" she says. She urges universities to launch more robust promotional campaigns, asking directly for body donations. ""There isn't the same public awareness campaign as there is for organ donation, for example."" Once this shortage is addressed, she says, then the US could ban for-profit donation. It's also possible that advances in virtual reality (VR) technology mean that cadavers simply won't be needed in the future. A trainee doctor could simply put on a headset and practice on a computer-generated patient. In 2023, Case Western Reserve University became one of the first medical schools in the United States to remove human bodies from its training programme, and replace them with VR models. Real human bodies preserve the ""body's colours and textures, [which] can make it difficult to discern, say, a nerve from a blood vessel"", Mark Griswold, a professor at the school, told the website Lifewire at the time. In contrast, their computer programme ""gives students a crystal clear 3D map of these anatomical structures and their relationships to each other"", he said. But Ms Kleeman says that, in general, VR technology is not yet good enough to replicate practicing on a cadaver. For the time being, it seems, there will remain a demand for human bodies - as well as money to be made.

611ca6cf30fb,Sitting up straight isn't the only secret to good posture - here are three more tips,,"Sitting up straight isn't the only secret to good posture - here are three more tips Getty Images Posture is all about regular movement, exercise and positive mindsets ""Sit up straight!"" - we've all heard that command barked at us many times. For years we've been told that good posture means standing tall, shoulders back and your spine straight as a rod. But that might not actually be true. According to Dr Xand van Tulleken, a doctor and BBC presenter, much of what we think we know about posture is outdated. In fact, trying to hold yourself bolt upright all day could do more harm than good, he told Morning Live . As the end of summer looms and many people return to work and studying, here are his three suggestions to improve your posture and in turn help look after your back. 1. Keep moving Getty Images Raising your arms above your head and moving your head from side to side can release tension Posture is dynamic, not static. The worst thing you can do is stay locked in one position for hours whether that's being perched at a desk, lounging on the sofa or scrolling on your phone. Dr Xand says the key is to change it up. There are lots of posture corrector straps, back braces and chairs that promise to change your life but ""you just need to be moving around in the day"". A lumbar cushion or an ergonomic chair can make sitting more comfortable and a wearable posture reminder might nudge you to stop hunching but none of these replace the basics of movement, strength and listening to your body. ""You can have the best chair, but if you spend eight hours sitting in it you'll still have back pain."" Dr Xand also cautions that some back gadgets marketed as improving posture can force you into one position that constrains and restricts your movement and that's the opposite of what you want to be doing. Make sure you stand, stretch and take regular breaks - even small shifts can reset your muscles, he says. 2. Build strength, not stiffness Getty Images Contrary to what some might think, perfect posture isn't about balancing a book on your head Good posture comes from strong muscles, but that doesn't mean you need a gym membership or Olympic ambitions. Dr Xand suggests regular exercises to build a stronger core and back. Simple movements like raising your arms above your head and turning your head from side to side ""can lift some tension and help you feel instantly better"". ""What we want is for our body to support itself,"" Dr Xand explains. Exercises like pilates and yoga can be a good way to stretch your body and target specific pain points, he says. The NHS website also suggests simple exercises which can be done at home to improve your strength. 3. Change your mindset Getty Images Stress can be a contributing factor to bad posture and back pain Posture isn't just about muscles, it's also about mindset. The way we sit, stand and move often reflects how stressed we're feeling about what we're doing. Hunched shoulders at a laptop can be as much about deadlines as desk set-up so it's important to reflect on your attitude towards work or study. ""Pain is not just about muscles, it's emotional and psychological,"" explains Dr Xand. He says that previously people would be told to focus on their desk set-up without taking into account that pain can be a result of ""stress, the amount of time you're doing your job and whether you do any exercise."" ""Your seat height is important but other facts are also important,"" he adds. So, sometimes fixing your posture is as much about easing your schedule as it is about stretching your spine. In some cases poor posture (not just back pain) can be down to an underlying medical condition and you should check in with your GP if concerned. According to the NHS , if you're suffering from back pain you should try and stay active, take anti-inflammatory medicines and try doing some exercises and stretches. You should see a GP if your back pain doesn't improve after treating it at home for a few weeks or the pain is getting worse over time.

dfa576935b10,Will Serena Williams's weight-loss admission help shed stigma of anti-obesity drugs?,,"Serena Williams, one of the most successful athletes of all time, has spoken out about using weight loss drugs - she says, to lift the ""stigma"" around using such medication. Will her outspoken comments instil a new sense of confidence in those using the drugs? And could her honesty quieten the critics? The 43-year-old tennis star, who broke records and won 23 grand slam titles through her career, was the embodiment of fitness and athletic prowess. But, after having kids, even she, like so many of us, has admitted to struggling to shift those extra pounds. In the end, Williams told the Today Show on TV in the US, that she had to look at her extra weight as ""an opponent"". Despite ""training five hours a day"" and ""running, walking, biking, stair climbing,"" she couldn't pulverise this adversary like she did to her opponents on the tennis court - so in the end, she says, she had no other choice but to ""try something different"". Many of her friends were using GLP-1 - the group of medications which help with weight loss, so she decided to try it. Williams is adamant that the medication route - she won't say which brand she is taking - wasn't easy, and certainly not a shortcut to her losing 31lb (14kg) over the past eight months. There is scepticism about the timing of the tennis star's recent transparency - she has just become a spokesperson for Ro, a company which sells GLP-1 brands like Wegovy and Zepbound (known as Mounjaro in the UK) through its weight-loss programme, and her husband is also an investor. Despite this and the potential side effects of taking the medication, her honesty will hit a nerve for many - she says she is speaking out to take away the shame that so many women feel when it comes to using drugs to help them lose weight. Caleb Luna, assistant professor of feminist studies at the University of California, says having someone like Serena Williams speaking out is ""a breakthrough"". They say it helps silence the critics of how ""weight loss is achieved"" who say that ""people are taking the easy way out"" by using weight loss drugs. ""It gets rid of the stereotype that these drugs are for fat people who are being lazy and incompetent. ""In that respect it's maybe a good thing."" But Caleb also says the revelation about her need to resort to using GLP-1 medication is slightly ""terrifying"" and makes them feel ""a little bit sad"". They worry that all it does is belittle hard work and dedication, instead, focussing on appearance and the pressure to look a certain way. ""She has achieved things that so few people, in our time and throughout history have achieved. ""But now it just shows how all those accomplishments can be undermined by body size. ""Scarily, weight loss seems to outshine all those record-breaking achievements."" Williams's weight and her looks have been scrutinised throughout her life. The burden, the pressure to fit in with society's expectations does not diminish no matter how much sporting success an athlete has in their career. And while she may be the most high profile sports star who openly uses weight loss medication, there are many others in the public eye who have spoken out. Oprah Winfrey says she uses GLP-1 as a tool, along with exercise and healthy eating, to stop herself ""yo-yoing"" with her weight. Actress Whoopi Goldberg says she lost the weight of ""two people"" after taking the drug, and singer Kelly Clarkson, who says she was ""chased"" by her ""doctor for two years"" before she agreed to take it, are among the dozens of stars who have been open about taking the medication. Williams left the world of tennis behind back in 2022, when she played the final match of her career in the US Open, but she is still a powerhouse of strength and has wanted to reach what she describes as her ""healthy weight"" since the birth of her second child, Adira. In her interview with the Today Show, says she felt like her ""body was missing something"" and she wasn't able to get down to what she felt comfortable with - despite intense training. Dr Claire Madigan, a senior research associate in behavioural medicine at the School of Sport, Exercise and Health Sciences at Loughborough University, says elite athletes can find it hard to lose weight. ""They are used to consuming a lot of calories and when they leave the sport they can find it difficult - it needs a change in behaviour."" Dr Madigan said  it was good to see that Williams mentioned her weight loss was not just down to the drug - ""she did have to focus on the diet and physical activity"". She added: ""It's great she is talking about how difficult it is to lose weight after having a baby."" But she wonders if Williams's message might be lost and even demotivate some women.  ""The drugs are quite expensive and the average person may think here is an elite athlete, she's got access to the gym, she's got time, she has a nutritionist… and she's had to use GLP-1s"". Dr Madigan also expressed concern that the potential side effects of taking the drugs - which can include gastrointestinal problems like vomiting and diarrhoea, and in rare cases, gallbladder and kidney problems - may not have been widely discussed in the publicity surrounding Williams's announcement. Williams says she did not experience any side effects, and told Women's Health magazine that she is finally seeing the benefits of all her hard work at the gym. ""My joints are a lot better,"" she says, ""I just had my check-up, and the doctor said everything - including my blood sugar levels - looked great."" And, even though, she's no longer breaking new ground on the tennis courts, she is still smashing her own records, with the help, she says of weight loss drugs. She's currently training for a half marathon. ""I am running farther than I ever have,"" she says proudly.

2034b2f67111,Lucy Letby's new expert supporters claim no babies were deliberately harmed. Who should we believe?,,"Lucy Letby's new expert supporters claim no babies were deliberately harmed. Who should we believe? Jonathan Coffey BBC Panorama BBC Listen to Jonathan read this article. When it comes to the Lucy Letby case, there are two parallel universes. In one, the question of her guilt is settled. She is a monster who murdered seven babies and attempted to murder seven more while she was a nurse at the Countess of Chester Hospital between 2015 and 2016. In the other universe, Letby is the victim of a flawed criminal justice system in which unreliable medical evidence was used to condemn and imprison an innocent woman. This is what Letby's barrister Mark McDonald argues. He says he has the backing of a panel of the best experts in the world who say there is no evidence any babies were deliberately harmed. These extremes are both disturbing and bewildering. One of them is wrong - but which? Who should we believe? An alternative version of events The families of the infants say there is no doubt. Letby was convicted after a 10-month trial by a jury that had considered a vast range of evidence. They say Letby's defenders are picking on small bits of evidence out of context and that the constant questioning of her guilt is deeply distressing. I have spent almost three years investigating the Letby case - in that time I have made three Panorama documentaries and cowritten a book on the subject with my colleague Judith Moritz. Yet, if true, the new evidence, presented by Mark McDonald in a series of high-profile press conferences and media releases, is shocking. According to his experts, the prosecution expert medical case is unreliable. Mark McDonald has not released the panel's full reports, which are currently with the Criminal Cases Review Commission (CCRC), the body he needs to persuade to reopen Letby's case, but he has released summaries of the panel's findings. Panorama Barrister Mark McDonald says his panel of leading experts found no evidence that any babies were deliberately harmed Letby was found guilty of 15 counts of murder and attempted murder, and the jury in her original trial reached unanimous verdicts on three of those cases. That is a good indication of where the strongest medical evidence might lie. To get a sense of the imperfections woven through both the prosecution and the defence arguments, it's worth looking at one of those cases in which the guilty verdict was unanimous: that of Baby O. What really happened to Baby O? Baby O was born in June 2016, one of triplet brothers. At Letby's trial, the jury was told that his death was in part the result of liver injuries, which the prosecution pathologist described as impact-type injuries - similar to those in a car accident. As in other cases for which Letby was convicted, the prosecution said circumstantial evidence also tied her to the crime. However, a paediatric pathologist who was not involved in the case but has seen Baby O's post-mortem report, says it was ""unlikely"" Baby O's liver injuries were caused by impact - as the prosecution claims. ""You can't completely rule out the possibility,"" says the pathologist, who does not want to be identified. ""But in my view, the location of the injuries and the condition of the liver tissue itself don't fit with that explanation."" Which raises the obvious question - if the prosecution were wrong about Baby O's liver injuries, then why did he die? Questions around air embolism Letby was accused of injecting air into the blood of Baby O as well as that of other babies. This, the prosecution said, caused an air bubble and a blockage in the circulation known as air embolism. During the trial the prosecution pointed to several pieces of evidence to make their case, including a 1989 academic study of air embolism in newborn babies, which noted skin discolouration as one possible feature of it. Prosecutors argued that these same skin colour changes were observed in several babies in the Letby case. Reuters In many aspects of the Letby case, the answer is not clear-cut However, Dr Shoo Lee, a Canadian neonatologist and one of the authors of that 1989 study, is now part of Letby's team of defence experts working with Mark McDonald. He argues that his study was misused. He says skin discolouration has not featured in any reported cases of air embolism in babies where the air has entered the circulation via a vein – which is what the prosecution alleged happened in the Letby case. In other words, the prosecution was wrong to use skin discolouration as evidence of air embolism. It sounds significant. But is it enough to defeat the air embolism allegations? As with many aspects of the Letby case, the answer is not clear-cut. The prosecution did not rely on skin discolouration alone to make their case for air embolism. And although there have not been any reported cases of skin discolouration in babies where air has entered the circulation via a vein, some critics have argued that the number of reported air embolism cases is small and that the theory is still possible. Andy Rain/ EPA - EFE/REX/Shutterstock Professor Neena Modi believes there is some postmortem evidence of air embolism but this is likely to have occurred during resuscitation (pictured far left, with Professor Shoo Lee far right) To muddy the waters further, another of Mark McDonald's panel of experts has said that in fact there was post-mortem evidence of air embolism in the babies. ""We know these babies suffered air embolism because of the post-mortem imaging in some of them,"" says Neena Modi, a professor of neonatal medicine. She believes this is highly likely to have occurred during resuscitation, and that there are much more plausible explanations for the collapses and deaths of the babies in the Letby case than air embolism. The air embolism theory, she said, was ""highly speculative"". But her remarks show the debate is far from settled. The needle theory: another explanation? There has been another explanation for Baby O's death. In December 2024, Mark McDonald called a press conference in which one of his experts, Dr Richard Taylor, claimed that a doctor had accidentally pierced the baby's liver with a needle during resuscitation. This, he argued, had led to the baby's death. Dr Taylor added: ""I think the doctor knows who they are. I have to say from a personal point of view that if this had happened to me, I'd be unable to sleep at night knowing that what I had done had led to the death of a baby, and now there is a nurse in jail, convicted of murder."" The doctor accused of causing the baby's death was subsequently identified as Stephen Brearey – one of Letby's principal accusers at the Countess of Chester Hospital. Mr Brearey says: ""Given the ongoing investigations and inquiries, and to respect the confidentiality of those involved, I will not be making any further comment at this time."" Julia Quenzler / BBC The needle theory was examined at length during Lucy Letby's trial It was a bombshell claim. But does the evidence support it? One indication that the needle theory might be shaky was that Dr Taylor, by his own admission, had not seen Baby O's medical notes and was relying on a report that had been written by two other experts. Another obvious problem with the needle theory is that it had already been examined at length during Letby's trial. The prosecution pathologist concluded that there was no evidence that a needle had pierced Baby O's liver while he was alive and the paediatric pathologist we spoke to agrees. They told us: ""These injuries weren't caused by a needle. They were in different parts of the liver and there was no sign of any needle injury on the liver."" Even if the needle had penetrated the baby's liver, it cannot explain why Baby O collapsed in the first place or why he died - the needle was inserted after the baby's final and fatal collapse towards the end of the resuscitation. When asked if he still stood by his comments about the doctor's needle, Dr Taylor told us that while the needle may not have been the primary cause of death, his ""opinion has not substantially changed"". He said the ""needle probably penetrated the liver"" of Baby O, and ""probably accelerated his demise"". Lack of consensus among the experts The question of where this leaves the case presented by Mark McDonald's panel of experts when it comes to the needle theory is a difficult one to answer. It would appear that among the experts working with Letby's defence, there is not consensus. Consultant neonatologist Dr Neil Aiton is one of the authors of the original report on which Dr Taylor based his comments. Dr Aiton says that he has examined the evidence independently and has concluded that Baby O's liver injuries were caused by inappropriate resuscitation attempts, including hyperinflation of the baby's lungs. However, he also says it was ""pretty clear"" a needle had punctured the liver during resuscitation. When Dr Aiton was told that other experts, including the paediatric pathologist who spoke to the BBC, have examined the case of Baby O and said that it is implausible to conclude this happened, he said that there were two possibilities. Either the liver ruptured because of a needle or it ruptured spontaneously. Dr Aiton's position appears to be that poor resuscitation caused the baby's liver injuries and whether the rupturing was caused by a needle or not is ""not important"". That is a contrast from what Dr Taylor said in that December press conference. And critics say Dr Aiton's account still does not explain why Baby O collapsed in the first place and why he needed such desperate resuscitation. A summary report from Letby's expert panel appears to back further away from the needle theory. It says a needle ""may have"" punctured the liver. Other experts, including the paediatric pathologist, said that Dr Aiton's observation of hyper-inflated lungs would not explain Baby O's liver injuries. Once again, the case illustrates how difficult it is to distinguish between plausible and implausible claims. The debate around birth trauma Since that press conference, other experts working for Letby's defence team have put forward another theory for Baby O's death. They say his liver injuries were the result of traumatic delivery at the time of birth. Professor Modi says this was a ""highly plausible cause"". But that has been contested from a surprising direction. Dr Mike Hall, a neonatologist, was Lucy Letby's original defence expert and attended court throughout her trial. He has been a staunch critic of her conviction, arguing her trial wasn't fair and that there is no definitive medical evidence that babies were deliberately harmed. Panorama Dr Mike Hall, Letby's original defence expert, says there is no record of a traumatic delivery in Baby O's medical notes However, Dr Hall's view is that evidence for the birth trauma theory is simply not there. He notes that Baby O was born in good condition by caesarean section and there is no record of a traumatic delivery in the baby's medical notes. ""There's still no evidence that anyone did anything deliberately to harm Baby O,"" he adds. ""However, something was going on with Baby O, which we haven't explained. ""We don't know what the cause of this is. But that doesn't mean that we therefore have to pretend that we know."" The insulin evidence For the jury, Baby O was one of the clearest cases that proved Letby was a killer. And yet there appears to be flawed expert evidence on both sides. There were two other cases where the jury returned unanimous verdicts – the cases of Babies F and L. The prosecution argued that both babies had been poisoned with insulin and highlighted blood tests that it said were clear evidence of this. For the prosecution, the insulin cases proved that someone at the Countess of Chester Hospital was harming babies. Letby's defence have, meanwhile, marshalled numerous arguments against the insulin theory. One is that the blood test used - an immunoassay - is inaccurate and should have been verified. But even Letby's experts accept the test is accurate around 98% of the time. Another argument is that premature babies can process insulin differently and that the blood test results are ""within the expected range for pre-term infants"". But the medical specialists we've spoken to are baffled by this claim and say it goes against mainstream scientific understanding. PA For the jury, Baby O was one of the clearest cases that proved Letby was a killer Of course, mainstream opinion can be wrong. But it is difficult to tell because Letby's defence team have not shared the scientific evidence. One of the experts behind the report – a mechanical engineer who carries out biomedical research – clarified that his analysis says the blood test results were ""not uncommon"". However, Letby's defence declined to show the BBC the published studies that support this claim. Once again, the claims of both the prosecution and defence are not clear-cut. Ultimately, the question of whether Letby's case should be re-examined by the Court of Appeal now lies with CCRC. They have the task of studying Mark McDonald's expert reports. If he is successful and Lucy Letby's case is referred back to the Court of Appeal - that is ultimately where the expert evidence on both sides will face a true reckoning.

c0083b5e9223,Drinks that make you chill - do they really do what it says on the tin?,,"Drinks that make you chill - do they really do what it says on the tin? Ruth Clegg Health and wellbeing reporter Getty Images Calm in a can. Relaxation after a few sips. That's what some drinks companies are promising with beverages formulated specifically to help you chill out. Lucy and Serena swear by them. They're good friends who, like many, are juggling careers,  the chaos of having small children, trying to stay fit, and everything else in between. ""These drinks aren't going to get rid of all my worries and anxieties,"" Serena says, ""but if they give me a little boost - then I'll take it."" Lucy finds them really useful too, especially when she's feeling a bit overwhelmed. ""If I get that low-level panic, then with a drink of Trip or something like it, I can bring it back round."" But after an advert by one of the industry's best-known brands was banned for suggesting its drinks helped with stress and anxiety, there have been questions about whether drinks of this kind are quite as effective as they make out. BBC News has spoken to nutritionists and dietitians who are sceptical the small amounts of supplements the drinks contain could really bring about that sense of zen. One psychologist has suggested that we might actually ""create our own calm"" when we set aside time for ourselves with something that feels like a treat. Steven Oakes Lucy and Serena say the drinks can make them feel calm if life gets stressful The ""functional beverage"" market - that's drinks with additional health benefits - is booming, with British supermarkets seeing sales jump by 24.5% in the last 12 months, according to one market research firm. Almost 30% of UK households now buy these functional drinks, Worldpanel by Numerator says. So, what's actually in them that's supposed to help you feel more mellow or give your health a boost? Well, that's where things can get complicated, as each brand takes a different approach. Along with Trip's Mindful Blend, other companies like Rheal, Grass&Co, Goodrays and supermarket own-brands, advertise that their drinks contain supplements including: Lion's Mane extract – a type of mushroom found in east Asian countries L-theanine – an amino acid found primarily in green and black tea Ashwagandha – a herb cultivated in areas of Asia, Africa, and Europe Magnesium – a mineral the human body needs to function properly These supplements are all commonly found in many health and wellbeing products and are associated with enhancing mood, boosting energy, supporting cognition, and helping with stress. But how robust is the evidence for that? It's tricky because there are many studies of varying credibility each suggesting different levels of efficacy. Trip's advert, which suggested its ingredients were stress and anxiety busters, breached the Advertising Standards Agency's (ASA) code, with the ASA ruling that Trip's claims their drinks could ""prevent, treat or cure disease"" were a step too far. Trip told BBC News the ruling related to ""a single page on the website"" and it has made the ""changes requested"". It says it's confident its ingredients permit the use of the word ""calm"" which is ""widely and lawfully used by many brands"". Getty Images Clockwise from left: Lion's Mane, Ashwagandha root and powder, magnesium supplement pills, and black tea - a source of L-theanine Dietitian Reema Patel is concerned the amount of supplement in these drinks may not give consumers the emotional balance, feelings of calm, or stress relief that is advertised across the industry. She highlights a growing body of evidence around the funghi Lion's Mane, but says there are no conclusive findings about whether it can have any impact - as yet. ""The research is still very much in its infancy,"" she says. "" In one of the more advanced clinical trials , a small number of participants were given 1800mg  - that's at least four times more than what is in some of these drinks."" Studies suggest women are more likely to consume these kinds of supplements, but they're not always front and centre in the research. The lack of research that includes female participants is partly down to menstrual cycles and fluctuating hormones, making it more ""complicated to track"", Ms Patel explains. But these drinks can make a good alternative to drinking alcohol she says, and she has clients who have made the switch from having a wine or a gin and tonic every night to opening a can of one of these drinks to help them unwind. ""I think you can take a lot of the claims with a pinch of salt, but they are definitely giving people that other option."" Emily May Emily May says older clientele at the coffee shop where she works are really into wellness drinks Dr Sinead Roberts, a performance nutritionist, says supplements can make a difference, but they tend to work for certain groups of people in specific circumstances - such as high-performing athletes who want that extra edge, or people who are deficient in a certain nutrient - not necessarily for the general population. If you enjoy the taste, ""crack on"", Dr Roberts says, but if you want to reduce stress and anxiety you're probably best saving your £2 or £3 and putting it towards a ""therapy session or a massage at the end of the month"". ""A trace of Lion's Mane or Ashgawanda in a fizzy drink is not going to make any difference,"" she adds. Emily May, 25, first discovered these drinks at Glastonbury a couple of years ago. She's not overly bothered about trying to reach a state of zen through them - she just likes the taste. ""I'm ADHD,"" Emily says, ""so I would definitely need a lot more than one of those drinks to calm me down."" TRIP via ASA Trip's banned advert made health claims which are prohibited, the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) said There is a fine line between advertising that a product will give you a feeling of calm and quiet, and claiming these kinds of drinks will help with mental health problems. Psychologist Natasha Tiwari says mental health and well-being are ""increasingly conflated"" in the wellness sector, creating a ""toxic mix"". There can be a positive - yet temporary - change in mood and consumers might feel a buzz, she says, not because of the ingredients necessarily, but because ""everything around the experience of the product is real"". ""So you've bought a drink which, let's say, is a little bit pricier than the alternatives in the market. Therefore you make a commitment to sit down quietly and enjoy it nicely,"" she says. ""You look at the branding - which is lovely and calming - you're processing your environment in the moment, and then actually what you're experiencing truly is a calm moment in your otherwise busy day. That's not fake."" And it's that little window of peace that Lucy and Serena yearn for - and for a few minutes a fizzy drink in a can gives them that, whether the science really agrees, or not. BBC News contacted all the brands mentioned in this article. Grass&Co told us it's their mission ""to deliver high-strength natural adaptogen and vitamin-packed blends formulated by experts... which are supported by approved health claims."" Goodrays said it wasn't ""offering a panacea"", but that it was ""certainly offering a healthier alternative"" with the ""best efficacy possible"".

bb01b4d6545d,A walk-in fishermen's clinic saved Tom from sepsis - and could transform the NHS,,"A walk-in fishermen's clinic saved Tom from sepsis - and could transform the NHS BBC Tom Parker, 37, broke his leg in a fishing accident three miles off the Devon coast Tom Parker was working alone three miles (4.8km) off the Devon coast when his fishing boat hit a wave and lurched to one side. ""I was pulling one of the ropes and I slipped and fell,"" he says. ""I had this really, really bad pain in my ankle. So much so, I couldn't get up off the floor."" He didn't know it at the time, but Tom, 37, had broken his fibula and badly damaged his ankle ligaments. He somehow hauled in his fishing gear and made it to hospital to get patched up, but months after the accident his wound just wouldn't heal properly. It was only after he turned up at an innovative clinic on the quayside in Brixham that he was put on strong antibiotics and told he needed a second operation. ""Without that service, I would have probably ended up with my leg turning septic and I'm not too sure what would have happened after that,"" he says. Under a 10-year plan, published last month , health officials said the NHS in England needed to undergo a radical shift, away from hospitals to community care, and away from treating sickness to preventing it in the first place. There are already small-scale examples of that approach in action across the country. So what can we learn from the Brixham model and how can the idea of targeted, local care be extended to treat millions more NHS patients? The fishermen's health clinic in Brixham is one of 79 Seafit clinics set up in fishing ports across the UK since 2019 On a clear summer morning a spare room in the trawler agent's offices in Brixham harbour is quickly being converted into a temporary health clinic. Blue screens are dragged across to split up the space: a makeshift reception at the front and then just enough room to cram in two GPs, a pharmacist, a physiotherapist, two nurses and someone organising prostate cancer tests. There's a steady line of port workers coming in, from buyers in the fish market next door to crews from the trawlers in the harbour. ""The skippers of the boats and the whole fishing community now know exactly where to find us,"" says Dr James Gunning, the local NHS GP in charge of the clinic that day. ""They're a community that fits into health inequalities, where a population either can't access, or struggles to access, normal NHS services."" Staff working on the project start early in the morning, walking around the docks and coaxing workers off the boats with promises of free health screenings and physio. ""Fishermen don't have nine-to-five jobs, they don't have lunchtime where they can just pop off their fishing boat and to the GP's office, and so it's really important that we take those services to them,"" says Sandra Welch, chief executive of the Seafarers Hospital Society, which runs the initiative along with another charity, the Fishermen's Mission. A pop-up Seafit clinic operates every three months in Brixham and at similar sites at ports across the UK, including Folkestone, Peterhead and Kilkeel in Northern Ireland. Some services have started to expand and now offer skin cancer checks, mobile dental services and access to mental health counselling. Dr James Gunning, a local GP in Brixham, runs the fishermen's health clinic at the port along with a team of doctors, nurses and physiotherapists In its 10-year plan the NHS accepts that those who live in coastal and rural areas are more likely to experience worse health outcomes and to die younger. Seaside and coastal towns often have older populations with more complex health needs, while at the same time local NHS services can suffer from recruitment problems, leaving staffing gaps where they are needed most. An analysis of hospital statistics by the BBC suggests NHS trusts in England treating coastal communities tend to have higher than average wait times for both emergency care and appointments booked in advance, like surgery. The answer, according to NHS bosses and the Westminster government, is to shift as much treatment as possible out of those expensive hospitals. Under the 10-year plan a network of 300 neighbourhood health centres will be opened across England , starting in areas with the lowest healthy life expectancy. The sites, which should eventually be open 12 hours a day, six days a week, will be staffed by a mix of GPs, nurses, social care workers, pharmacists, mental health specialists and other medics. The big idea, as with the Brixham fishermen's clinic, is to better tailor health services to local communities, and offer people more checks and tests to stop them falling sick in the first place. Much of this might feel very familiar. Similar ambitions were set out by ministers in 2019, 2015 and even by the Blair government back in the early 2000s. ""Despite being the right aim, none of those truly delivered,"" says Luisa Pettigrew, a GP and senior policy fellow at the Health Foundation think tank. ""Moving money out of hospitals and into community services is hard to do. You need the upfront investment and the results might not be visible for five or 10 years, in some cases longer."" Healthcare unions have also questioned how the new centres will be staffed, saying doctors ""must not be moved around like pieces on a chess board or made to work even harder"". Rob Caunter, 66, was diagnosed with prostate cancer after being given a blood test at the fishermen's clinic in Brixham The medics working in Brixham though are convinced their local, preventative approach can benefit not just the fishing community but the wider health service. ""We've managed to find new diabetic patients who otherwise may have gone on to develop more serious disease,"" says Dr Gunning. ""We've picked out others with cardiovascular disease, and those with high blood pressure. So we would certainly hope we can prevent more costly illness from developing."" Rob Caunter, who finally retired from the fish market this year, is just finishing his radiotherapy treatment for prostate cancer. The 66-year-old, who has a family history of the disease, was diagnosed after staff at the clinic convinced him to take a blood test. ""I was gobsmacked really because I didn't think there was anything wrong with me,"" he says. ""If I never went for the checks, I don't think I would be here today. So it was a real godsend for them to come down to the quay."" Get our flagship newsletter with all the headlines you need to start the day.

8ae1892ec3da,What is chickenpox and how can I get my child vaccinated?,,"What is chickenpox and how can I get my child vaccinated? Michelle Roberts Digital health editor, BBC News Getty Images Calamine lotion can be used to help relieve the itchiness of chickenpox spots Young children in the UK will soon be offered a free chickenpox vaccine on the NHS. It will be added to the list of standard childhood vaccinations from January 2026, and there will be a catch-up programme for older children. What is chickenpox and how can you catch it? Chickenpox is a highly contagious disease caused by the varicella zoster virus (VZV) . The virus is transmitted through direct contact between people, or through airborne droplets in coughs and sneezes. It is very easy to catch, especially if you've never had it before. While it mostly affects children - around half have had it by their fourth birthday - people of any age can get it. What are the symptoms of chicken pox and what does the rash look like? Getty Images The first symptoms include a fever, muscle aches and pains and generally feeling unwell. A couple of days later, an itchy, spotty rash appears. These red or pink dots can appear anywhere on the body, including inside the mouth. Some children might have only a few spots, but others can be covered from head to toe. The spots fill up with fluid and become blisters before crusting over to form scabs, which eventually drop off and clear up. You are contagious and can spread chickenpox to other people from two days before the first spots develop until they have all formed scabs, which is usually five days after they first appear. How dangerous is chickenpox? Most cases in children are mild, although they will feel unwell and will need to miss school or nursery for several days. Some children will go on to develop complications. In rare cases chicken pox can cause a swelling of the brain, called encephalitis; an inflammation of the lungs, called pneumonitis; and stroke, which can result in hospitalisation and - very rarely - death. Chickenpox is often more serious in very young infants and adults. It can be dangerous in pregnancy, causing complications in both the mother and the baby. Can you get chickenpox twice? How will the chickenpox vaccine work and who can get it? You can already get the chickenpox vaccine privately in the UK, at a cost of up to £200. But experts say adding the varicella vaccine to the official NHS childhood immunisation programme will dramatically reduce the number of people who catch chickenpox, leading to far fewer serious cases. The vaccine doesn't guarantee lifetime immunity, but it does greatly reduce the risk of someone developing chickenpox or having a bad case. Serious side effects, such as a severe allergic reaction, are very rare. From January 2026, children will be automatically offered two doses at 12 and 18 months of age. They will get the combined MMRV vaccine, which protects against measles, mumps, rubella and varicella. It is a live vaccine which means it contains a weakened version of the chickenpox virus. As such, it is not recommended for those with a compromised immune system because of an illness like HIV or as a result of treatment such as chemotherapy. The move will bring the UK into line with other countries which already offer routine varicella vaccination, including Germany, Canada, Australia and the US. It had previously been thought that vaccinating children against chickenpox would cause a problematic rise in shingles, but a recent long-term study from the US disproved that theory. The committee which advises the government on vaccinations - the JCVI - recommended that all children be given the MMRV in November 2023 . It also suggested that there should be a temporary catch-up programme for slightly older children who will just miss out. Details of this are expected in due course. The decision to vaccinate against chickenpox was announced as new data revealed none of the main childhood vaccines in England reached the 95% uptake target in 2024/25. Some 91.9% of five-year-olds had received one dose of the MMR vaccine, unchanged from 2023/24 and the lowest level since 2010/11, according to the UK Health Security Agency. What is shingles and is there a vaccine? You cannot catch shingles. It is an extremely painful condition that can develop years after a chickenpox infection. That is because when people get chickenpox, the virus stays in the body and can be reactivated later, which causes shingles. This might happen, for example, if your immune system is weakened because of stress, certain conditions, or treatments like chemotherapy. For many, it's a painful skin rash - usually on the chest or abdomen - on one side of the body. Medicine (antiviral tablets) can help to speed up recovery and avoid longer-lasting problems. A shingles vaccine is available on the NHS for: people who turned 65 on or after 1 September 2023 people aged 70 to 79 who have not yet been vaccinated people aged 50+ with a severely weakened immune system You can get shingles more than once, so it's important to get vaccinated even if you've had shingles before. If you get shingles after being vaccinated, the symptoms can be much milder.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn0rnqj52y5o,Health,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/4209/live/2447a060-826f-11f0-a832-3d1a9236e27e.jpg,2025-08-29T11:51:59.331000+00:00,cd6132626fe51ff5d8372f998116090972c38981
e0d84b8c5b3c,Caffeine pouch craze: A teenage trend troubling some experts,,"Caffeine pouch craze: A teenage trend troubling some experts Michelle Roberts Digital health editor, BBC News Getty Images A growing number of US teenagers are using caffeine pouches to get an energy rush, say experts who worry the trend could soon take off in the UK. The small teabag-like pouches, placed between the lip and gum, deliver a quick caffeine hit, straight to the bloodstream. Some social media influencers are pushing products, recommending them to gym-goers for performance or to students who want to be alert for exams. TikTok Shop sells lots of brands and flavours that could appeal to young people, says Dr Rob van Dam from George Washington University. But with a single pouch containing as much caffeine as two cups of regular coffee, it could be easy to take too much and get bad side effects, he says. There is already growing concern in the UK about young people using nicotine pouches or snus . Caffeine pouches are also discreet - you may not be able to tell if someone has one in their mouth - making it easy to hide from parents and teachers. Some fans of the product boast online about ""buzzing"" from using two pouches at once for an extra big caffeine rush. As caffeine is rapidly absorbed, the effects may begin minutes after ingestion and last for a number of hours. Levels can go out of control. Dr van Dam told BBC News: ""Young people may have less tolerance to caffeine and there's a chance they could end up in the emergency room if they have too much."" Why caffeine and what happens if you have too much? Getty Images Caffeine is a stimulant that can make you feel more alert and less sleepy due to its effect on the brain and nervous system. Lewis James, from the School of Sport, Exercise and Health Sciences at Loughborough University, says there is good evidence that caffeine can help make exercise feel easier. It's become one of the most regularly used supplements among athletes. As you exercise your body produces a chemical called adenosine which makes you feel tired. Caffeine blocks the adenosine receptors in your nerves, so your brain perceives less pain and fatigue. But it acts on other parts of the body too - including the cardiovascular system - which can be risky. High levels can cause a rapid heart rate, abnormal heart rhythms and seizures. Although rare, there are documented deaths from excess caffeine. Some people are more sensitive to caffeine than others and can feel nauseous, anxious and irritable, and get headaches even at lower doses. Generally, up to 400mg of caffeine a day appears to be safe for most healthy adults - that's around four cups of instant coffee. Tea contains a bit less, so five cups a day is usually fine. Pregnant women are advised to halve daily intake to 200mg or less. Children and teenagers are also more susceptible to the risks and potential for an overdose. This is why energy drinks containing over 150mg of caffeine, for example, are already required by EU law to carry labels stating: ""High caffeine content. Not recommended for children or pregnant or breast-feeding women"". Watch for other drinks or food that contain caffeine Dr van Dam says it can be easy to overload. Caffeine is found in many drinks and some foods, so it is important to check how much you are consuming. ""While it's harder to overdose on coffee, with these products it's easier, especially if young people are using energy drinks too."" He says some products, when you check them in the laboratory, contain more caffeine than they claim on the labelling. Getty Images Coffee : a mug contains about 100-140mg of caffeine, but it can vary widely Tea : a mug contains about 75mg Energy drinks : often contain 80mg in a 250ml can Soft drinks : typically contains about 40mg per can Chocolate : there is around 25mg of caffeine in a 50g bar of dark chocolate and around 10mg in a 50g bar of milk chocolate Dentists say using them over time can irritate the gums - similar to snus and nicotine pouches . Some experts worry caffeine pouches could be a gateway to using these. Bini Suresh is head of dietetics at the Cleveland Clinic, London, and a spokesperson for the British Dietetic Association. She says using pouches may feel ""trendy"" or harmless, but there's a real risk of normalising stimulant use in teens and young adults, potentially creating patterns of dependency. She told the BBC: ""While caffeine may give a temporary boost, it can disrupt sleep and worsen fatigue over time, especially in children and teens who are more sensitive to its effects."" If young people are going to have caffeine, the BDA and NHS both advise caution. The European Food Safety Authority suggests 3mg/kg body weight as the upper limit for children and adolescents, meaning a child weighing 30kg should have no more than 90mg in a day. Instead of reaching for caffeine, Ms Suresh says it's far better to focus on regular meals, hydration and nutrient-rich foods that support steady energy levels throughout the day. A healthy diet with enough iron, protein and slow-releasing carbohydrates should do the job, she says.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy8k8xgry98o,Health,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/5233/live/cdedb4b0-6e97-11f0-8fff-3d35836e2f17.jpg,2025-08-01T00:06:06.293000+00:00,faa51bba819679dc41cb03cfb5e028a5230a1985
357df2b2c383,"Sleep, exercise, hydrate - do we really need to stick to recommended daily doses?",,"Sleep, exercise, hydrate - do we really need to stick to recommended daily doses? Ruth Clegg Health and wellbeing reporter Getty Images It felt like there was a collective sigh of relief when a study, published this week, suggested 10,000 steps a day isn't the health utopia we had all been led to believe. The news that we only had to reach 7,000 steps was enough to quite literally stop us in our fervent step-counting stride. So what about some of the other health targets that many of us swear by? Can we fall short of the mark but still live long, healthy and happy lives? We've taken a handful of commonly cited healthy lifestyle benchmarks, examined them with various experts to get an idea of why they exist, explored the health claims, and, most importantly asked if there is any wriggle room. Is sleep so important that we have to spend so much of our lives doing it? How much exercise is enough? What about drinking water? How much do we really need? Disclosure - the below is not medical advice, it's more of an inspection of many of the health ideals we have on our radar. Water (6-8 glasses a day) Getty Images According to the NHS, the average grown-up should be drinking between six and eight glasses (1.5-2 litres) of water a day . However, maybe we don't need to cart our fancy flagons around with us as much as we thought. Prof Neil Turner, kidney specialist at the University of Edinburgh, says as humans we existed for thousands of years without knowing what a pint or a litre was. ""I mean, mice don't need flashing water bottles telling them how much to drink - why do we?"" he says. ""Our bodies are set up to do things just right - we eat when we are hungry, we breathe when we need to breathe, and we drink when we are thirsty."" Oh. Is it really that simple? According to Prof Turner, who has seen a lot of kidneys in his time, that rule applies to the vast majority of us. Those with specific conditions, like a kidney disorder, may have to drink more. He says if our urine is dark, in the general healthy population, we shouldn't panic that we haven't drunk enough - that is the kidney doing its job. It is reserving water in our body, he explains, and our body should tell us that we feel thirsty and then we will get a drink. Dr Linia Patel, a performance nutritionist, disagrees. We might drink different amounts, she says, due to factors like our size, how warm we are, whether we've been drinking alcohol, but she feels having a target of 1.5 to 2 litres is a good thing - especially for women. ""I would definitely say from a women's health point of view, where I work, what I see is a lot of the symptoms [associated] with being dehydrated. It might be fatigue, constipation, brain fog, feeling hungry [or] cravings."" She says that if the problem is related to hydration then it's ""an easy one to get right, if you're consistent with it"". Sleep (7-9 hours a night) Getty Images Moving on to sleep - the NHS recommends seven to nine hours a night for the average adult, and there's not much wriggle room to be had there. Prof Ama Johal, a specialist in sleep disorders from Queen Mary University of London, says sleep is vital; without it we are beginning to shave years off our lives. ""The evidence is there, there are huge bodies of research which show that the health benefits are multiple. ""A good night's sleep - that's at least seven hours of quality sleep - reduces the risk  of obesity, diabetes, depression and finally, it lowers mortality rates."" He points to a study which used 10,000 British civil servants - those that slept for fewer than five hours a night had an increased risk of early death. But could we shave an hour off the minimum recommended - and settle for six hours a night? ""No,"" Prof Johal says. ""As soon as we lower the limit then there's a risk people will think it's ok to sleep for less time."" Cat napping? ""Unfortunately not,"" he says, ""Our bodies have very different reactions to naps through the day, and eventually if we tried to make up the hours we were missing overnight by sleeping through the day, we would struggle to fall asleep at night."" But all is not lost, nappers among us - there are studies that suggest a short snooze in the day can keep the brain youthful, and even compensate for poor or broken sleep the night before. Prof Johal suggests that for those who struggle to get the recommended amount, try to target a few nights of good sleep a week, and just being ""more aware that sleep is so important"". Emily & Lucy Emily Thornton and Lucy Hird - active walkers, but they struggle to sleep Emily and Lucy are two avid walkers from Manchester. But alongside their love of walking, the two women share a less healthy trait: they struggle to nod off because of their anxiety. But they say the target of seven hours sleep a night is something they ""are working towards"". Exercise (150 mins a week) Emily and Lucy are, however, ""definitely nailing it"" when it comes to exercise. Through their group, Soft Girls who Hike, they have found a love of walking which has not only improved their mental health, they say, but connected them with many other women. They don't try to meet all the healthy benchmarks on their radar, they explain, because ""life just gets in the way"". But they are doing 7,000 steps a day and taking long, low impact walks at the weekend. The Chief Medical Officer recommends doing 150 minutes of exercise a week and two strength training sessions. Is that achievable for most? Dr Sinead Roberts, a sports nutritionist who trains elite athletes, is pragmatic in her approach. While moderate strength training and physical activity are vital for maintaining muscle mass, she says, as well as resistance to injuries and supporting our immune systems, you have to adapt the recommendations to fit with your life. ""Rules are for the obedience of fools and the guidance of wise people,"" she says. ""This phrase really does apply here. ""I have friends who do nothing - and that really does show, I say, 'You're walking like an 80-year-old!' ""But if you are doing one strength session a week and some moderate exercise then that is definitely a good thing, just try and do more if you can."" She uses an analogy of a highway - the more things we can do to stay healthy the wider the road, which, in turn means we can go off course sometimes without careering up a grassy verge. ""All those benchmarks are interlinked - you can't just do one healthy thing and ignore the rest. Equally you don't need to put so much pressure on yourself to achieve them all."" This attitude chimes with Emily and Lucy, who say they happily ""chip away"" at some of the health benchmarks. ""For example, we might do five minutes of meditation [which is] better than nothing, but we wouldn't stress about not hitting the recommended goal."" Mindfulness (10 mins a day) Getty Images Through its Every Mind Matters campaign, the NHS recommends 10 minutes of mindfulness a day. Basically, instead of pondering the future or thinking about the past, you pay attention to the moment, noticing what is going on inside and outside ourselves, letting our thoughts pass by without judgement. Some studies suggest activities like mindfulness can have a positive effect and also help change the structure of the brain. Psychologist Natasha Tiwari, founder of The Veda Group, says 10 minutes is a good start to ""give the mind time to settle, and the brain enough time to truly benefit"" from the process of mindfulness. But many of us lead busy lives, and to carve out 10 minutes in the day can be a luxury. In some respects, could having these targets make life more stressful? Ms Tiwari disagrees - it's less about the time spent and more about the awareness of mindfulness and bringing it to our everyday lives. ""Even brief pauses,"" she explains, ""can still have a positive impact"". Most experts I've spoken to agree that while benchmarks are useful, and simplicity is key, it's better not to fixate on a number. Rather, find a way to incorporate a healthy outlook to diet, exercise and mental health into everyday life. After sitting for some time writing this, I am going to sign off - there is another health benchmark I've just come across: limiting sitting down to less than eight hours a day. So, I had better get moving.

a84975956de4,Ketamine helped me escape my negative thoughts - then it nearly killed me,,"Ketamine helped me escape my negative thoughts - then it nearly killed me Ruth Clegg Health and wellbeing reporter, BBC News Abbie Abbie first began using ketamine when she was 16 Abbie was 16 years old when she started using ketamine. It was the first time she had felt in control. The negative thoughts that had swamped her mind since a young age began to dissipate. Twelve years later and fresh out of rehab she's still battling with the addiction that almost took her life. She wants to speak out to explain why ketamine has become such a popular drug - especially among young people with mental health problems - and to talk about the damage it can do long term. Abbie's warning comes as the first NHS clinic in the UK - dedicated to helping children struggling with ketamine use - opens on Merseyside , with patients as young as 12 needing help. Ketamine is unlike many other street drugs due to the way it interacts with the brain. Small amounts of the Class B drug can give a sense of euphoria and excitement, while large amounts can lead to a state known as the ""K-hole,"" where users feel detached from reality - an out-of-body-type experience. The number of under 16s reporting a problem with the drug has nearly doubled over the past two years, overtaking cocaine in popularity with children and young people. Nearly half those (49%) who started treatment for drug misuse in 2023-24 said they had a mental health problem, with more than a quarter not receiving any treatment for the latter. Details of help and support with addiction are available in the UK at BBC Action Line Experts are warning that some young people are taking dangerous amounts of ketamine not only due to its low price and ease of availability, but also because of the dissociative feelings it brings. ""What we are seeing is a perfect storm,"" David Gill, the founder of Risk and Resilience, a company which trains front-line workers on emerging drug trends. ""We have more young people struggling with depression, trauma, anxiety, a lack of services - and we have a very cheap street drug that helps them disconnect."" Abbie's first line of ketamine did exactly that. She says it ""felt like such a powerful place to be"". ""My thoughts no longer had a negative effect on me - life was passing me by, but I didn't have to engage with it."" Abbie's childhood had been hard. Struggling with mental health problems and undiagnosed ADHD, she had left school at 14 and found herself in a whirlwind of drink, drugs and unhealthy relationships. Abbie Abbie's weight dropped during the course of her addiction Although addiction cast a long shadow throughout her 20s, Abbie managed to  secure a place at university, staying clean throughout, and obtained a healthcare degree. She is smart, articulate and wants to do well, but after two abusive and controlling relationships ketamine became the only means she had to block out the trauma. Yet when she went to her GP to seek help she was prescribed sleeping tablets and told to ""come off the ket"". ""The withdrawals were so bad I would be shaking and vomiting,"" she says, ""it wasn't that easy to just come off it."" Then a deeper level of addiction took hold. ""I always prided myself in the early stages of addiction of keeping my morals and my values and not lying to people,"" Abbie says, ""but I couldn't stop the drugs and I found myself hiding my use to my friends."" Things escalated. Eventually Abbie was taking ketamine every day - incessantly. The only time she would take a shower, she says, would be when she went out to meet her dealer on the street. The physical effects of overuse began to kick in - horrific abdominal pains, known as K-cramps, would leave her screaming in agony. She would place boiling hot water bottles on her abdomen - burning her skin. And then she would take even more ketamine to numb the pain. What is ketamine? Often referred to as ket, Special K or just K, ketamine is a powerful horse tranquilliser and anaesthetic. It is a licensed drug and can be prescribed medically When misused, it can cause serious and sometimes permanent damage to the bladder It is currently a Class B drug under the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971 The penalty for possession is up to five years in prison, an unlimited fine - or both Abbie documents her recovery on TikTok and gives support to other young people This cycle of drug abuse is something public health consultant Professor Rachel Isba also sees in her new clinic for under 16s experiencing the physical side effects of ketamine use. Chronic use of the drug can cause ketamine-induced uropathy, a relatively new condition, which affects the bladder, kidneys and liver. The bladder lining becomes so inflamed it can result in permanent damage and it has to be removed. Prof Isba says the first signs of ketamine bladder are severe abdominal pains, urinating blood and jelly from the damaged bladder lining. ""Patients referred to the clinic will receive a holistic approach,"" she says, ""care from the specialist urology team to treat the physical effects of the drug, and then they will be supported - and referred if necessary -  to community services who can help with the often complex reasons behind their drug use."" 'Completely helpless' Maisie Maisie started taking ketamine at festivals - but her use spiralled out of control Sarah Norman, from St Helens, says she felt like a ""silent watcher"" as her daughter began to ""fade in front"" of her eyes. Last September she discovered that Maisie, 25, was addicted to ketamine, which had caused potentially irreversible damage to her kidneys. ""We are just an average family,"" Sarah says. ""I never thought Maisie would have ended up addicted to any drugs - she doesn't even drink alcohol."" Maisie had kept it quiet - ashamed of the stigma attached to her ketamine use. But what had started as a party drug she'd take at festivals had become a substance she couldn't function without. In the end her partner moved out with their three-year-old son. ""I had nothing left to live for,"" Maisie says. ""It got to the point I was doing bump after bump [snorting small amounts of it]. ""For a short time I would be knocked out of reality - then I would take more."" Sarah Norman Sarah documents her daughter's addiction and offers advice to other parents online Eventually, Maisie's mum and sister carried her into hospital - she weighed just five stone (32kg). ""The doctors said her body was failing her,"" Sarah says. ""We thought we might lose her."" As a parent, she says, she felt completely helpless. ""It's hell on earth, there is nothing you can do. You ask yourself what you should have done."" Maisie's kidneys were fitted with nephrostomy tubes, which drain the urine out into two bags - which she now carries around with her. Yet even this major operation didn't end Maisie's addiction. But finally, after fighting for a place in rehab she has now been clean for five months. Sarah posts about her daughter's drug journey on Tik Tok where many parents reach out to her for help and advice with their own children. ""This drug is just horrific, so many other young people are struggling with it,"" Sarah says. ""I am so proud of Maisie though, she's going to Narcotics Anonymous meetings every night. ""The pain she must have been through - and still goes through - I'm not sure if I'd have been as resilient and strong as she is."" Maisie Maisie's kidneys were badly damaged and she needed two tubes fitted to drain the urine Abbie was rejected from NHS rehabilitation services twice, and reached a point where she considered taking her own life. ""There was so much chaos around me and the services weren't going to help me, I just wanted to end it all,"" she says. But after sending a five-page letter to the panel that decides on eligibility she finally managed to access a detox and rehabilitation service. ""I had three choices,"" Abbie says, ""rehab, section - or in a coffin."" Abbie was treated in the same rehabilitation unit as Maisie. She is now out, clean and proud of herself but says the treatment she received failed to deal with her trauma. ""I can look after myself on a daily basis and I'm doing OK.

5b36514efb65,The English neighbourhood that claims to hold the secret to fixing the NHS,,"The English neighbourhood that claims to hold the secret to fixing the NHS Nick Triggle Health correspondent BBC Listen to this article on BBC Sounds Ministers, health staff and the public gathered in London last week for a summit to discuss the 10-year NHS plan in England. It was the final roadshow in a nationwide tour to help set out the strategy the government says will rescue the ""broken"" NHS, which has a waiting list of nearly 7.5 million patients and public satisfaction of just 21% - a record low. Not for the first time, moving healthcare away from hospitals and into the community is being touted as a way of treating people better and for less. Research suggests that every £100 spent on community care would otherwise cost £131 for hospital care. This helps explain why Health Secretary Wes Streeting has promised to turn the NHS into a neighbourhood health service. Washwood Heath, a community health clinic that was set up in a deprived part of east Birmingham two years ago when the Conservative government was in power, is a living, working example of what this could look like. Here, hospital doctors, GPs, nurses, occupational therapists, council social care teams, mental health professionals and charity staff work under one roof. Washwood Heath clinic brings together hospital staff, GPs, mental health teams, social care workers and charities under one roof The three-storey building combines an urgent treatment centre offering some of the services usually provided by hospitals, as well as a diagnostic service (for MRI scans, X rays and ultrasounds), alongside mental health care and wider social support. In practice, this allows for addressing social problems such as housing issues, alongside treating physical health conditions, plus arranging support for daily tasks such as washing and dressing. The target is the most frequent users of health services - and the aim is to keep them well and out of hospital. ""We want to work with the 10% of the population that is responsible for 70 to 80% of its use,"" explains Richard Kirby, head of Birmingham Community Healthcare NHS Trust, one of the key partners at Washwood Heath. ""The NHS cannot meet their needs on its own – it requires partnership working."" Streeting himself is on board. Speaking to the BBC this week, he said that Washwood was a ""pioneering service"" and he is firm that the model could ""be the future of the NHS"". However not everyone is convinced. And while few argue against the principle of more care within the community, there are wider questions around just how feasible it is on a bigger scale. A model system to unblock beds? In the middle of the clinic, staff gather around five touchscreens, each containing up-to-date information about patients from east Birmingham who are in hospital or making calls to the ambulance service. Their goal is to get these patients discharged from hospital as swiftly as they can - and keep them out. One way of doing this is by arranging remote monitoring from the 'virtual wards team' (which allows doctors to keep an eye on patients who would otherwise have to stay on the wards), as well as ordering equipment such as mobility aids and medicine dispensers to be delivered to their homes. Nurse Dani Fullerton delayed retirement to work at the centre The team is also automatically alerted if a patient registered at the clinic calls for an ambulance or is admitted to hospital. There is a live link to the local Heartlands Hospital, where the clinic's own team of therapists and paramedics see patients face-to-face on the wards and liaise with hospital staff to try to get them home. ""Our job is to identify which patients will benefit from our help,"" says nurse Dani Fullerton. ""It's so different from anything I have done before."" Tackling loneliness to save money One issue the neighbourhood teams are homing in on is loneliness - they have identified this as a way to keep down hospital numbers. Government commissioned research published in 2020 suggests the cost of severe loneliness to be more than £9,500 for each person in that category, due to the combined impact on wellbeing, health, and work productivity. So, at the centre, local neighbourhood teams plan intense support for the most vulnerable residents, knitting together not just what the NHS and council provide, but what charities can offer too. ""We have patients going to GPs and A&E basically because they are lonely,"" says Christine Francis, who is employed as a 'social prescriber'. Her job is to help find new activities and groups for the lonely and then accompany them until they are settled. ""The NHS cannot solve [loneliness]. But I can link patients in with befriending services or, if they can get out and about, local groups such as knitting groups or organised walks."" Ms Francis also works with groups who can help with house cleaning and tackle other issues associated with poor mental health, such as hoarding. At present some doubt there is enough robust evidence from the research to show the effectiveness of social prescribing. The neighbourhood team is adamant their approach is making a difference, however, based on what they've seen first-hand. Hamzisah Aslam, an occupational therapist at Birmingham Council, recalls visiting one patient with health and alcohol problems, whose home was littered with cardboard boxes and rubbish. The visit, also attended by a GP, mental health professional and social prescriber, lasted more than an hour. ""Afterwards, we had a five-minute debrief and drew up a plan and it was actioned the next day - you would never be able to do that if we were all working individually."" Dr Subeena Suleman: ""It meant we had more time for other patients"" Some GPs I spoke to have also observed a positive impact. Dr Subeena Suleman says the neighbourhood team worked with two patients from her practice who were frequent visitors because of their range of health and social issues. An estimated 100 appointments at the GP surgery were freed up over six months. ""It meant we had more time for other patients,"" says Dr Suleman. ""We even started offering longer appointments of up to 30 minutes for those that need it."" In the first 12 months since Washwood Heath began operating, GP visits among the local population supported by the centre fell by 31%, A&E attendances by 20% and admissions to hospital by 21%. However, there is not yet robust evidence to quantify how much more efficient the new model would be if expanded across the city. The knock-on effect for hospitals The most recent addition to the centre is an emergency service for patients with respiratory illness that opened in December to address the fact that around 40% of admissions to the nearby Heartlands Hospital related to lung and breathing conditions. So far the service, which is staffed by UHB respiratory specialist nurses and doctors, has taken in 670 patients. Christopher Thomas is one of them. He used to be a builder and worked with asbestos. Now 77, he has chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, which he believes has links to his job. Recently, he went to hospital after coughing up blood, and was told he had pneumonia - but rather than being kept in hospital, he was discharged into the care of Washwood clinic's respiratory service. This, he says, worked far better for him. ""I was able to stay at home to rest and take my medications and I can just ring the team at Washwood if I have any concerns."" Christopher Thomas believes his chronic lung disease was caused by asbestos exposure as a builder Respiratory medicine consultant Dr Rifat Rashid is also positive. ""Here we can see and test patients quickly – there are not the delays we have in hospital waiting for results."" But there are broader benefits for the hospital too in her view - she says GPs are starting to refer their patients directly to Washwood Heath and ambulances are also now bringing patients to the centre rather than the hospital. Despite the benefits of fewer admissions, ultimately hospitals are no less full - while fewer people in the Washwood area are being admitted, patients from elsewhere have filled the beds. The model is being expanded across the city - the aim is to have a network of six community hubs and 25 to 30 integrated neighbourhood teams, covering Birmingham's population of 1.4 million people. Not every centre will be identical. For example, in the north of the city, there might be a focus on helping with frailty to support the older, more affluent population demographic. Getty Images Birmingham has a network of large health centres but many places don't There are of course costs - these are estimated at less than £100,000 as the six hubs as the centres will use existing buildings and redeployed staff. Richard Kirby thinks the model could easily be replicated nationwide. ""We believe this is the right model,"" he insists. But there is a catch. As he puts it, ""It only works when the whole system buys into it."" Tight budgets and a 'cynical' sector Part of the problem with making the whole system buy into it is money. Ruth Rankine, an NHS Confederation primary care director, believes that during times, such as now, when money is tight, collaboration generally becomes harder. ""People are too focused on their budgets and making sure it goes on where they immediately need it,"" she says. But clinics like Washwood Heath require collaboration and pooling resources. The other issue, she argues, is that the hospital sector has, in places, ""been a bit cynical"". ""The problem is that it takes time to get results – you need to invest in front and then it can be years before it has an impact."" Another concern is around finding suitable premises. In Birmingham, officials I spoke to acknowledged they were lucky to have a network of large health centres (as they were beneficiaries of a short-lived finance programme launched in the 2000s to improve community NHS buildings) but many other places around the country do not. This is a concern for Dr Richard Vautrey, a GP from Leeds who has been involved in national NHS politics since the early 2000s in his role as a British Medical Association negotiator and, more recently, as president of the Royal College of GPs. ""There just isn't enough of the right premises,"" he argues. ""In many places, GPs and community colleagues cannot work side-by-side because the buildings are too outdated and cramped. ""We've had all the talk over 40 new hospitals, but where are the 1,000 new neighbourhood clinics?"" Political pressure and short-term thinking There are deeper rooted political pressures too that make a nationwide rollout of centres like those in Birmingham a challenge. Even though the work in east Birmingham ticks a lot of the boxes set out by independent peer and NHS surgeon Lord Darzi in his report for the government last autumn, after being commissioned by Wes Streeting, this is not the first time such calls have been made. Lord Darzi himself set out similar goals in a report for the Blair government in 2007. Ms Rankine has had a front-row view of this. She worked for the Department of Health and NHS executive for more than a decade from the mid-1990s. ""We've been talking about this for 20, 30 years, but failed to achieve it on any sort of scale."" And today, there are a series of contradictory priorities facing the NHS. Often it is those considered the most pressing that are addressed first. Hugh Alderwick, Director of Policy at the Health Foundation think-tank, who advised Labour in opposition, points out that the big focus is on hitting the 18-week hospital waiting time targets. ""It's pulling in the opposite direction of this ambition to move care out into the community,"" he observes. So can the government really reshape the NHS into a neighbourhood health service? Dr Vautrey, for one is optimistic. ""It can,"" he says. ""But it will take determination, effort – and money.""

9d30631a4465,Why are disposable vapes being banned and how harmful is vaping?,,"Why are disposable vapes being banned and how harmful is vaping? Peter Dazeley/ Getty Creative Disposable vapes have been found to damage the environment From Sunday, it will be illegal for businesses to sell or supply disposable vapes. The government hopes the ban will reduce environmental damage caused by the devices and help cut the number of children and young people vaping. How are the rules about vapes changing? Disposable vapes ban From 1 June 2025 , businesses will be banned from selling or supplying any single-use vapes , whether that's in shops or online. Retailers caught breaking the law in England face a minimum £200 fine, with a prison sentence of up to two years for repeat offences. Penalties are broadly similar in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. Trading Standards will be able to seize any single-use vapes they find. Only devices considered to be reusable will be legal. That means that they must have a rechargeable battery, a replaceable coil, and be refillable. It won't be illegal to own a disposable vape after 1 June. Customers can still return them, and retailers have an obligation to get rid of them. Vaping tax Vaping products are already subject to 20% VAT but, unlike tobacco, they do not currently attract a separate additional tax. A new vaping duty will start on 1 October 2026 . It will be charged at a flat rate of £2.20 per 10ml vaping liquid. At the same time, tobacco duty will be increased to preserve the financial incentive for cigarette smokers to switch to vaping. Advertising and sponsorship ban The government's Tobacco and Vapes Bill - which is currently making its way through Parliament - will outlaw vape advertising and sponsorship. It will also restrict the flavours, packaging and display of vapes and other nicotine products. Children have been targeted with colours, branding and flavours such as bubble gum or candy floss , to push a product that can lead to nicotine addiction, the British Medical Association has warned. Illegal vapes The government is also cracking down on iIlegal vapes, which are widely available and are much more likely to contain other harmful chemicals or drugs. More than six million illegal vaping products were seized by Trading Standards officers across England between 2022 and 2024, according to analysis by the BBC. Why are disposable vapes so bad for the environment? The ban on disposable vapes was introduced to tackle their impact on the environment. Almost five million single-use vapes were thrown away each week in 2023, according to the Department for Environment, Food, and Rural Affairs (Defra). As well as lithium-ion batteries, vapes also contain circuit boards. If these aren't not disposed of properly, they can leak toxic compounds such as cobalt and copper. That means fish, and marine mammals could mistake vapes for food and ingest poisonous chemicals. The Local Government Association (LGA), also says that single-use vapes are ""a hazard for waste and litter collection and cause fires in bin lorries "". However, recycling disposable vapes is not straightforward because of their size and the way they are manufactured, which makes them difficult to take apart. These minerals and the lithium could - if recovered - be reused for green technologies such as electric car batteries or in wind turbines. There is currently no large-scale disposable vape recycling in the UK. There are so many different types of vape on the market that it is difficult to develop a standard recycling process. How many children and adults vape? Around 18% of 11 to 17-year-olds (980,000 children) have tried vaping , according to a 2024 survey by health charity ASH (Action on Smoking and Health). About 7% (390,000 children) said they currently vaped, down from 8% in 2023, but still well above the 4% figure recorded in 2020. In contrast, just over 5% of 11 to 17-year-olds (280,000 children) said they currently smoked, while just under 3% (150,000 children) said they both smoked and vaped. Among all age groups over 16, the use of vapes has risen, with about 5.1 million people using a vape or e-cigarette in 2023. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) says 5.9% of people aged 16 and over vaped every day, up slightly from the previous year, while another 3.9% did so occasionally. The group with the highest rate of vape use - nearly 16% - was 16-24 year-olds. Getty The NHS says vaping should only be for adults quitting smoking How harmful are vapes to children and adults? Vaping is nowhere near as harmful as smoking cigarettes, which contain tobacco, tar and a range of other toxic cancer-causing chemicals, and is one of the largest preventable causes of illness and death in the UK. But because vaping may itself cause long-term damage to lungs, hearts and brains, it is only recommended for adult smokers trying to quit as part of the NHS ""swap to stop"" programme. The vapour inhaled contains a small amount of chemicals, often including the addictive substance nicotine. ""Vapes can be an effective way for adult smokers to quit - but we have always been clear that children and adult non-smokers should never vape,"" the Department of Health and Social Care has said. More research is needed to fully understand the effects of vaping, but in December 2023, the World Health Organization (WHO) warned ""alarming evidence"" was growing about the damage it causes. In February 2025, the government said a £62m research project would track 100,000 eight to 18-year-olds for a decade to better understand the risks.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/czxyny0w7wdo,Health,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/d8e4/live/520e8480-3aff-11f0-ab2d-a33f931f78dd.jpg,2025-05-30T09:37:32.888000+00:00,e4c9b4b7e8740c7605f54107af850280560d662b
1ca793eb1cc4,Labour's plan for benefits throws up a bigger dilemma,,"Labour's plan for benefits throws up a bigger dilemma Faisal Islam Economics editor BBC In the next 24 hours and then over the following fortnight up until the Spring Statement, the government is going to talk a lot about a broken welfare system that is failing the people who use it, the economy and taxpayers. Taking a tough call on fixing it goes against the instincts of much of the Labour Party and has already sparked an internal backlash that could rise to ministerial level, as well as protests. The government is making two key related judgements. The first is that the country cannot afford to sustain recent ballooning increases in the health-related benefit bill and caseload, in particular for mental illness. At the same time, it will argue that a job is the best medicine. Underlying this is an assumption that a health-related benefits system that was built-up to deal with industrial injuries can't apply to the post-pandemic service economy workforce. The net result is likely to be significant changes to Personal Independence Payments, aiming to reduce eligibility for the highest levels of payments, especially among those of working age with mental illness. In addition, there will be a levelling of the generosity of the health component of Universal Credit. This will save billions of pounds, and about a billion of that will be reinvested in trying to help get those capable of part-time work some help for a partial return. Mapping welfare trends The Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) is rolling in real-time data. ""Cluster analysis maps"" reveal to ministers exactly who is claiming out of work benefits and where they are. As the numbers continue to increase, the data is being cut by sector, postcode, age and type of illness. Every pattern is being analysed. The idea was that the data would firstly offer the government insight into how it could make billions of pounds of cuts to a rapidly growing bill in order to help the Chancellor meet her self-imposed government borrowing rules. Secondly, it was meant to point to more fundamental reforms to welfare, also designed to temper the same ballooning rise in the costs of dealing with ill health among the working population. The data has thrown up answers. That poor mental health is driving the rise in claimants is clear. To a lesser extent, so too is the role that raising the state pension age has played, with many thousands who would previously have been retired now claiming health-related benefits. But it has also thrown up a major question too: does cutting welfare to incentivise people to work more hours in fact do the opposite - nudging them out of the workforce altogether and ultimately increasing the benefit bill? If this is the case - and it is by no means a universally accepted interpretation of what has happened - then the question is whether further cuts could in fact increase the numbers claiming? And should Labour instead invest in getting people back into work? Growing sickness When I visited a job centre in Birmingham alongside the Work and Pensions Secretary Liz Kendall in the Autumn, I was taken aback by how the work coaches were talking as much about health as about work. ""There's a lot of mental health, depression and anxiety,"" Qam told me. GPs have reported that their surgery time is dominated by trying to work out whether their patients are ""fit for work"". Roughly 11 million fit notes are issued every year in England alone, with 93% assessing the patient as ""not fit for work"". That has doubled over a decade. In the latest quarter, 44% were for 5 weeks or more absence. From that pool of growing in-work sickness, a significant proportion ends up on some form of incapacity benefits. The Treasury's bill for health and disability benefits, which was £28bn in the year before the pandemic, is now £52bn a year. It is forecast by the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) to hit £70bn by the end of the decade. The pure financial aim here is to ""bend the curve"" down to nearer £60bn in that period. This means restricting both the generosity and eligibility of some - or all of such - payments. It could require a wholesale cash freeze so that benefits do not rise with inflation, for example, or the abolition of entire categories of recipients. 'Deaths of despair' An Institute for Fiscal Studies report published last week showed that wider measures of mental ill health have rocketed since the pandemic. Between 2002 and 2024, the number of 16-64-year-olds claiming disability benefits for mental or behavioural health conditions increased from 360,000 to 1.28 million. Every day in 2023 there were 10 extra ""deaths of despair"" (defined as deaths from alcohol, drugs or suicide) in England and Wales than the average between 2015 and 2019. Average sickness absence rates across the whole economy remained structurally higher than pre-pandemic. Of particular concern is how this affects young people. In a recent report DWP adviser Prof Paul Gregg points to the ""incredibly low"" chances of sustained returns to the workforce once a person has been on incapacity benefits for two years. About two fifths of new incapacity benefit claimants under 25 came directly from education. The latest DWP analysis shows these trends are now closely related to broader socio-economic vulnerabilities such as limited education and also with precarious sectors such as retail and hospitality. The question that remains is whether so many people really are more sick - and what role (if any) is played by the reduction in stigma around mental health. But then there is the question of how to address it. Overly binary Another major factor is that rise in the state pension age, which the DWP calculates, resulted in 89,000 older workers instead claiming health-related benefits. However, the sharp increase in claimants of such benefits since the pandemic is not only attributable to ageing populations or increasing mental health diagnoses. Research suggests there are significant systemic and policy-driven causes. At its heart the problem is perceived to be that the current welfare structure has become overly binary, failing to accommodate a growing demographic who should be able to do at least a bit of work. This rigidity - what ministers refer to as a ""hard boundary"" - inadvertently pushes individuals towards declaring complete unfitness for work, and can lead to total dependence on welfare, particularly Universal Credit Health (UC Health), rather than facilitating a gradual transition back into employment. PA Media Liz Kendall is expected to announce plans to cut £5-6bn a year from the welfare budget This has been bad for the economy, for employers, terrible for the public finances, and deeply concerning for the career prospects of individuals. History helps here. Health-related benefits are often a disguised form of unemployment. The caseload for incapacity benefits (which include not just UC Health but previous incarnations) since the 1970s shows the UK heading for a record of one in 12 adults of working age in receipt. But this is not the first such build-up. It happened in the late 1980s when Margaret Thatcher was prime minister, and it was reversed in the early 2000s under New Labour. The launch in 1986 of Restart Programme, a forerunner to JobSeekers Allowance modelled on Ronald Reagan's policies in the US, helped return many claimants to the workforce but also pushed a staggering number into incapacity claims. Over the decade and a half of this policy, there was a 1.6 million increase in people in receipt of the benefit. But at the time this migration from claimant unemployment into incapacity was apparently a deliberate strategy, as it helped deal with headlines about ""three million unemployed"". A middle ground The government has not yet published its analysis on the jobs market, but Prof Gregg's early thinking was made clear in a report for the Health Foundation. He argued that, historically, the welfare system responded effectively through a middle ground that allowed individuals to combine part-time work with partial welfare benefits. He puts this down to reforms introduced in the early 2000s, such as tax credits. This is essentially the crystallisation of Iain Duncan Smith's critique of then chancellor George Osborne's welfare cuts of 2016. He told me at the time that they were ""deeply unfair"" on working people and the vision of a proper welfare-to-work scheme ""could not be repeatedly salami-sliced"". PA Media There is an ""overdiagnosis"" of mental health conditions, the Health Secretary has said Some argue that those reforms created a situation where individuals, unable to sustain full-time work, gravitate towards more generous health-based welfare program. Crucially, claims began to rise in 2018. At the DWP ministers have tried to research the reasons behind the increase in caseload - and found that about a third of the increase can be explained as the predictable consequence of policy or of demographics. Prevention rather than cure With an ongoing flow of new claimants arriving in the system (nearly half a million in the last financial year) the onus is now on finding a prevention rather than a cure. And this is where it becomes tricky - one suggestion involves eliminating the current welfare trap by reintroducing intermediate support for part-time work. However, that requires extra funding, as well as a way of providing more personalised job searches and better mental health support. Another option is passing responsibilities to employers. In the Netherlands, employers bear significant responsibilities and financial costs if they fail to adequately support employees facing health challenges. In the early 2000s, the Dutch also had very high levels of incapacity but they now report employment rates of 83%. The structure of the jobs market in the UK makes that challenging to replicate - for example there are more insecure zero hours contracts. And given that businesses feel under pressure from National Insurance rises and a slow economy, could they really be cajoled into helping? Faster cuts The questions arising from the data will matter for the economy, for the public finances, our health, and young people's careers and livelihoods, at a time of considerable change. Fundamentally, it is a question of what the benefit system is for, at a time when illness is being redefined, and when the trends are, frankly, scary. Then there is the question of whether the public wants to pay even higher taxes in the hope of delivering long-term gain. Welfare-to-work programs can pay for themselves eventually, but the Government feels it needs to book faster cuts. That's because all of this is in the context of what ""fiscal headroom"" the government did have against the Chancellor's self-imposed borrowing targets being wiped out since the Trump shock to the world economy, the Budget and the announcements of extra European defence spending. Shutterstock It is currently unclear whether planned cuts could affect Personal Independence Payments But government insiders are at pains to argue that the primary motivation for any cuts is not regaining the extra room for manoeuvre. ""We don't need the OBR to tell us that we need to fix welfare to get people back to work. We don't need the OBR to tell us we need to make the NHS more productive. And we don't need the OBR to tell us that the taxpayer should be getting more value for money,"" a source told me. ""Headroom or no headroom the Chancellor is determined to push through the change we need to make Britain more secure and prosperous."" Ultimately, the economic imperative is clear - to bring a cohort of young people suffering a combination of mental ill health and joblessness back into work. And the government believes there is no way of doing this without, at least at first, hurting the incomes of ill people. There is going to be quite the backlash from disability charities, and in turn from backbench Labour MPs. That's why it's no exaggeration to say this month's explosive row about welfare will come to define this Government.

146aea72d6f7,First place in British Isles set to approve right to die,,"First place in British Isles set to approve right to die Dominic Hughes Health Correspondent, Douglas, Isle of Man Getty Images The Isle of Man could be the first jurisdiction in the British Isles to legalise assisted dying A law to give terminally ill adults on the Isle of Man the right to end their own lives is entering its final stages, making it potentially the first jurisdiction in the British Isles to legalise assisted dying. Anyone over the age of 18 and with a prognosis of 12 months or fewer to live would be eligible, under the legislation being debated in the Manx parliament. The bill will not be passed yet, since the Isle of Man's lower house has rejected an amendment that would have meant people would only need residency on the island for one year to take advantage of the legislation. The House of Keys continued to insist on five-year residency and have sent the legislation back to the upper house. The move comes as MPs in Westminster are scrutinising a bill that would legalise assisted dying in England and Wales. A separate bill is under discussion in Scotland. People on the Isle of Man eligible to request assisted dying would have to: Be terminally ill and ""reasonably expected"" to die within 12 months Be over the age of 18 Be registered with an Isle of Man GP Have the legal capacity to make the decision Have the decision verified by two independent doctors The measures have been a matter of strong debate in Tynwald, the island's parliament. It is likely the bill will receive Royal Assent and become law, with the scheme possibly up and running by 2027. Jersey - a self-governing territory like the Isle of Man which can make its own laws - is also moving ahead with legislation to establish an assisted dying service. 'A long and careful process' Former GP Dr Alex Allinson introduced the private members bill to Tynwald and has been pivotal in ushering it through the legislative process. He hopes this will be the last time it will need to be debated by the directly elected chamber. ""The passage of this bill has been a long and careful process starting in 2022 and has been properly consulted on, scrutinised and put through a full parliamentary process,"" Dr Allinson says. ""It lays the basis for further work to implement a service on the Island for those facing a terminal illness who would like more autonomy and dignity at the time of their death."" Among the key clauses in the most recent version of the bill are measures on age and length of prognosis. Getty Images Two independent doctors will have to approve the wishes of a person with a terminal illness who wants to access the assisted dying scheme on the Isle of Man How does the Isle of Man legislation differ from the Westminster bill? The Terminally Ill Adults (End of Life) Bill, introduced by backbench Labour MP Kim Leadbeater, is currently being scrutinised by MPs in Westminster. If passed it would become law in England and Wales. It has some similarities to the Isle of Man legislation - people must be terminally ill, over 18 and registered with a GP. Both bills spell out the need for patients to have the mental capacity to make the choice and be deemed to have expressed a clear, settled and informed wish, free from coercion or pressure. The Isle of Man bill says people would be expected to have fewer than 12 months to live, but the Leadbeater bill has adopted a more conservative six months. The Manx suggestion of needing five years of residency on the island to be eligible is to try to stop people going there to take advantage of the scheme, as people do by travelling to Switzerland's Dignitas clinic. On the Isle of Man, two independent doctors will need to agree the request for assisted dying, but Leadbeater has recently suggested that cases in England and Wales could be approved by a panel of experts rather than a single judge, as was originally proposed. That change has proved controversial, but is one of about 300 amendments being considered by a cross-party committee of MPs. Meanwhile, the legislation being proposed in Jersey has very similar restrictions to the Westminster plans. However, it has a proposal that would extend the right to die for terminally ill adults with six months or fewer left to live to 12 months for people with neurodegenerative conditions As with the Westminster legislation, the Isle of Man has experienced some passionate campaigning both for and against the proposed new law. A third of doctors who responded to an Isle of Man Medical Society survey in 2023 said they would consider leaving if the legislation was introduced. As a GP on the Isle of Man, Dr Martin Rankin is worried about the dangers of coercion Some doctors fear the legislation will be a ""slippery slope"" that will see the scope of the laws extended. Isle of Man GP Dr Martin Rankin is a member of the Medical Society and is worried about the dangers of coercion, where vulnerable people are pressured to end their lives early. ""The safeguards that are in place on this one, I'm not going to know if somebody has been coerced by a relative into ending their life sooner than they wish. ""So I really won't be getting involved in it."" Millie Blenkinsop-French has campaigned for assisted dying legislation for years, but saw her own son James die from cancer However, there have been some passionate campaigners who have spent years fighting for this legislation. Millie Blenkinsop-French lost her son James to neck cancer, aged only 52. It was a very difficult, painful death that cemented her belief in assisted dying for the terminally ill. ""Nobody in their right mind would be against assisted dying if they had to sit, like I did, and watch my son die. ""I wish with all my heart and soul that assisted dying had been in then, I really do, because he would have opted for it. He wasn't a stupid boy, he was a very intelligent young man. ""And it'll give an awful lot of people the chance that James didn't have, give an awful lot of people the chance to say, you know, 'enough is enough, let me pass over'."" The Isle of Man legislation now looks set to become law, but as politicians in Jersey, Westminster and Holyrood also consider their own proposals, the wider debate about assisted dying is far from over.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c78ed70qep7o,Health,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/495e/live/57f3a220-f2bd-11ef-896e-d7e7fb1719a4.jpg,2025-02-25T13:02:21.388000+00:00,a0de610c9dfe5efb5dde090e0ef5ce8bd98368ae
687de3d10465,Generation K: The disturbing rise of ketamine abuse among young people,,"Generation K: The disturbing rise of ketamine abuse among young people Jane Deith BBC File on 4 Investigates and Jill Collins BBC Listen to Jane read this article At the urology department of Burnley General Hospital, 26-year-old Ryan (not his real name) is having a drug solution inserted through a catheter - part of his treatment for a condition known as ketamine bladder. This procedure will not completely reverse the damage inflicted by Ryan's previous addiction to the Class B drug, but it will help him manage the symptoms. Ketamine, a powerful horse tranquiliser and anaesthetic, is a licensed drug and can be prescribed medically. However, when misused, it can cause serious and sometimes permanent damage to the bladder. The hospital is watching Ryan for signs of kidney failure, too. He worries about finding a girlfriend and having children. But he is stoical when he talks about passing blood and having to urinate numerous times a day. ""You could not be a ketamine addict for 30 years, 20 years,"" he says. ""You'd die."" He is under the care of consultant urologist Haytham Elsakka, who says he has witnessed a rise in young patients whose bladders have been damaged by ketamine use. ""Some of them are in their 30s, but most of them are 16 to 24,"" says Dr Elsakka. Around half of young patients end up needing surgery, he adds. Other risks from recreational use include liver failure, damage to the urethra, incontinence and impotence. ""We have seen young people under the age of 25 who've completely lost control of their bladders, who have had to have surgery, including bladder removal,"" says Abigail Wilson, lead clinical pharmacist for national drug and alcohol charity WithYou. Getty Images Lancashire County Council says it is supporting a growing number of families affected by ketamine addiction in the Burnley area In and around the town of Burnley, Ryan is far from alone. Lancashire County Council says it is helping a growing number of families affected by ketamine addiction in the Burnley area. According to WithYou, which runs a ketamine support service for young people aged 11 to 24, the number seeking help across Lancashire increased from 32 in 2018-19 to 123 by the end of 2024. And the area is not unusual. In England, the number of under-18s entering drug treatment who describe ketamine as one of their problem substances rose from 335 to 917 between 2020-21 and 2023-24, according to the National Drug Treatment Monitoring System. An anonymised 2023 survey of more than 13,000 secondary schoolchildren from 185 schools across England reported 11% of 15-year-olds had been offered ketamine at some point. The same study, conducted for NHS England, suggested the use of ketamine among schoolchildren had more than doubled in the last decade from 0.4% in 2013 to 0.9% in 2023. The drug came into the spotlight following the death of Friends actor Matthew Perry aged 54, after which a coroner found ketamine had been the primary cause. Doctors and experts subsequently described how the market for the drug in the US has exploded as it has grown in popularity among Hollywood celebrities. And thousands of miles away, among ordinary young people in UK towns, ketamine – also known as special K, vitamin K, or kit kat - has also become fashionable. Although highly dangerous, it is often seen as a sociable way to get high, with users buying it in powder form and snorting it. Getty Images Ketamine gained attention after the death of Friends actor Matthew Perry, with a coroner ruling it as the primary cause Now, just 11 years after ketamine was reclassified from Class C to Class B, the UK government is seeking expert advice on whether to make ketamine a Class A drug. This would mean anyone supplying it could be handed a life sentence. But some experts are sceptical this would make much of a difference. While ketamine use appears to be on the rise among the young, there is a sharp divide in opinion around what can be done to halt that. 'It's in the schools, it's in the parks' One Saturday afternoon in September 2023, the hottest day of the year, a 16-year-old called Preston McNally took ketamine with three friends in Burnley. High on the drug, he fell into the Leeds and Liverpool canal that flows through the town. Preston's friends had also taken the drug and did not call for help straight away, an inquest was later told. The coroner said Preston drowned due to ketamine intoxication. The inquest also heard that he had told his sister he was trying to quit just before he died. Those on the front line are well aware of the scale of the problem. ""The amount of mums that have said to me, 'It's everywhere',"" says Fr Alex Frost from St Matthews Church in the town. He runs a support group for parents of ketamine users. ""It's in the schools, it's in the parks."" Across Lancashire, recorded offences for possession and supply of ketamine rose by nearly 70% from 54 in 2023 to 91 in 2024. ""What we have seen, probably within the last 12 months, is the upturn in the use, particularly around children,"" says Insp Matt Plummer of Lancashire Police. ""Sometimes the parents have no idea."" Getty Images Once known as a party drug linked to club culture, ketamine use now appears to be shifting Once ketamine was known as a party drug, associated with the club scene. But there's evidence to suggest that has changed. In a 2024 report into drug trends in Greater Manchester, school-aged children recounted how they used it with friends to ""chill"" in the local parks or at home. Those who go on to use it away from social settings are often doing so ""to self-medicate unmet mental health support needs such as anxiety and trauma"", says the author of the report, Robert Ralphs, a professor of criminology and social policy at Manchester Metropolitan University. 'Everybody else is doing it' One mother, who we are calling Claire, told the BBC she was oblivious to the fact that her 14-year-old daughter Lexi (not her real name) was addicted to ketamine until the teenager ended up in hospital with severe stomach cramps. Lexi, who lives on a neat, well-cared-for street in Burnley, loved sport and dancing. But after she started secondary school, she says, a friend introduced her to ketamine. ""I knew it was illegal… and it was a horse tranquiliser,"" says Lexi. ""That's all I knew. I didn't really want to do it, but I just thought, well, everybody else is doing it and I didn't really want to be the odd one out."" One reason that so many young people are gravitating towards ketamine is they can buy it for pocket-money prices, according to Lexi. ""It were easy to get – like, really easy,"" she says. Getty Images Many young people are turning to ketamine because it is affordable and easy to buy, according to Lexi In Burnley, friends will chip in for the £15 to £30 it costs for a gram and share it. To feed her habit, Lexi would ask her mum for a couple of pounds for the bus or some make-up - or sometimes she would steal a £10 note. If Lexi had been coming home drunk or smelling of weed, her mother Claire would have twigged. Claire says: ""I was absolutely gobsmacked, just distraught, really, thinking: how did I not know?"" 'You're doing stupid amounts' What makes ketamine especially dangerous is that lots of people, particularly young people, wrongly see it as a lower-risk drug, says Mrs Wilson of the WithYou charity. At lower doses, she says, it has a similar effect to alcohol. ""The effects can wear off from about 40 minutes to just over an hour after taking it,"" she adds. ""If you want to keep those effects, then repeat dosing is required to continue them."" And this means users' habits can escalate rapidly, according to Aaron (not his real name), who lives in a small town outside Burnley and took his first snort of ketamine when he was just 16. ""Your tolerance goes up extremely quickly and within the first month you're doing stupid amounts,"" he says. Soon he was spending £200 month on the drug. Higher doses can lead to a state known as a K-hole, ""which is where you become completely detached from reality and also paralysed"", says Mrs Wilson. Then there is the psychological impact. The WithYou charity is helping Lexi recover from dependence on the drug, but also trauma and self-harm. Once, when she was high, she was the victim of a sexual assault. When kids are on ketamine, they are extremely vulnerable. 'Extremely dangerous' Some of the families of ketamine addicts the BBC has spoken to want the drug reclassified as Class A. But this would also mean children caught in possession of ketamine could face up to seven years in jail rather than five. Putting ketamine in the same bracket as heroin and cocaine ""may increase the stigma and make young people less likely to discuss their use and seek help"", warns Prof Ralphs. The government is currently seeking expert advice from the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs (ACMD) on whether the drug should be reclassified. ""Ketamine is an extremely dangerous substance and the recent rise in its use is deeply concerning,"" says Dame Diana Johnson, the policing minister. ""It is vital we are responding to all the latest evidence and advice to ensure people's safety and we will carefully consider the ACMD's recommendations before making any decision."" Joe Frost Families in Burnley are calling for more support to tackle what Fr Frost describes as a ketamine ""epidemic"" Families in the Burnley area say the authorities also need to do more to help those suffering as a result of what Fr Frost calls an ""epidemic"" of ketamine use. In response, Lancashire County Council says it is ""dedicated to supporting children and young people affected by ketamine use in our community"" and that it ""will continue to work tirelessly to address the challenges posed by ketamine use and to provide the necessary support to those in need"". 'The urge is always there' There is scepticism from those on the frontline that increased enforcement will solve the issue. ""It's not a case that we can just arrest our way out of the ketamine issue,"" says Insp Plummer. ""You could arrest 10, 15 people a day for the possession of ketamine if you found them, but it's not going to change the cycle, particularly with kids."" He adds that generally children caught with ketamine are given informal words of advice and referred for support, not charged. And some experts query how effective reclassification would be.  These include Prof Ralphs, who observes that the 2014 shift from Class C to Class B has not prevented the recent rise in usage among young people. He also suggests that would have no impact on people's decisions to supply it either, as most ketamine dealers already supply Class A substances as well. He adds that reclassification ""will not deter young people from using it if their underlying mental health and wellbeing needs continue to be unmet"". In the meantime, no one yet knows what the long-term effects will be for children who start taking ketamine at 12, 13 or 14. Community leaders and the families the BBC spoke to say they cannot wait for change, and that urgent action is needed now to try to prevent more young people suffering. Lexi says she is trying to move forward with her life. Since the doctors at the hospital told Lexi where her life could be heading, she has not used ketamine. Getting the drug out of her head is still not easy. She insists she will never take another dose of ketamine. But, she says, ""the urge is always there for me to do it again"".

afa88c43ce66,Assisted dying bill: What is in proposed law?,,"Assisted dying bill: What is in proposed law? Michelle Roberts Digital health editor, BBC News Getty Images MPs have voted in favour of proposals to legalise assisted dying in England and Wales. The bill will now face many more months of debate and scrutiny by MPs and peers, who could choose to amend it, with the approval of both Houses of Parliament needed for it to become law. It is also possible the bill could fall and not become law at all. The bill - called the Terminally Ill Adults (End of Life) Bill - would make it legal for over-18s who are terminally ill to be given assistance to end their own life. But there are requirements: They must be resident of England and Wales and be registered with a GP for at least 12 months They must have the mental capacity to make the choice and be deemed to have expressed a clear, settled and informed wish, free from coercion or pressure They must be expected to die within six months They must make two separate declarations, witnessed and signed (by them or a proxy on their behalf), about their wish to die Two independent doctors must be satisfied the person is eligible - and there must be at least seven days between the doctors’ assessments A High Court judge must hear from at least one of the doctors and can also question the dying person, or anyone else they consider appropriate. There must be a further 14 days after the judge has made the ruling (although this can be shortened to 48 hours in some circumstances) The bill defines the coordinating doctor as a registered medical practitioner with ""training, qualifications and experience"" at a level to be specified by the Health Secretary Under the bill, a doctor could prepare the ""approved"" substance (the bill does not detail what medication this is) but the person themselves must take it. No doctor or anyone else would be allowed to administer the medication to the terminally ill person. The doctor would stay with the person until they had self-administered the substance and died (or the doctor determines the procedure has failed). The person could decide not to take it, in which case the doctor would have to remove the substance immediately. Doctors would also not be under any obligation to take part in the assisted dying process. This is called physician-assisted suicide. Voluntary euthanasia is different and is where a health professional administers the drugs to the patient. Deaths covered by the assisted suicide bill would not need to be investigated by a coroner. But the bill would make it illegal for someone to pressure, coerce or use dishonesty to get someone to make a declaration that they wish to end their life or to induce someone to self-administer an approved substance. If someone is found guilty of either of these actions, they could face a jail sentence of up to 14 years. What's not included in the bill is how much the system would cost , who would pay and what the workload would be. And there is no detail about the judicial process - namely, how the evidence would be put before the High Court judge. Lord Thomas, former Lord Chief Justice, told the BBC's Today Programme that it cannot be a ""rubber stamping process"" and judges must be satisfied there is no coercion. The person seeking assisted dying would be advised to consider telling their family and GP, but would not legally have to.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx2l7m6r55do,Health,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/e2fa/live/9eab7220-a0dc-11ef-a64d-ff7a10629bab.jpg,2024-11-29T15:30:26.048000+00:00,6d9c03590d25f4ed78c0c17bb9537b9c29199947
7034120ca317,'My first cervical screening was over before I knew it',,"'My first cervical screening was over before I knew it' Erica Donnelly, Jessica Tse, Jack Latham The BBC spoke to six people - including Erica, Jessica and Jack - who have had their first cervical screening in the last six months People not knowing about options to make their cervical screening easier and more comfortable is ""costing lives"" , a cancer charity warned last month. To find out what having the test is really like for first timers, the BBC spoke to six people who have had their first cervical screening, formerly known as a smear test, in the last six months. Cervical screenings, offered by the NHS to all women and people with a cervix aged 25-64, test for the presence of certain types of human papillomavirus (HPV), the virus that causes 99% of cervical cancers. During the test, a nurse uses a speculum - a tool to open the vagina - and a brush to take a sample of cells from the cervix. This is what having the test done for the first time was like for six people, and what they wish they'd known beforehand. How did you feel beforehand? Erica Donnelly, 26, who lives in Sunderland, waited about a year to book her screening appointment after receiving an invite. ""I was in a massive panic about it because I have PTSD relating to sexual trauma, so I was really extra nervous about that,"" she says. When she finally had the test done last month, she brought her partner with her for support and to help her in case she had a flashback or a panic attack. Having them there also made the experience feel more ""comfortable and casual"", she says. Bianca Ionici, 27, who lives in London, says she put off her cervical screening ""for at least two years"" because of concerns about pain. But after getting another invite which contained a lot of information about the process, Bianca booked her screening in January. Bianca Ionici Bianca Ionici delayed her cervical screening because of concerns about pain Other people say they booked their screenings as soon as they could. Eleanor Gratton, who had her test at the end of last year aged 25, says her friends were scared the process would be ""uncomfortable and painful"". But as more and more people in her group had their screenings, she says they didn't find this to be the case. What did the test feel like? Jessica Tse was ""really anxious"" before her cervical screening in December. ""I didn't know if it was going to hurt"", she says. But the nurse was ""talking to me, distracting me throughout"" and explained the procedure ""really clearly"", she adds. ""Pain-wise, it was uncomfortable and it was something I hadn't felt before,"" Bianca recalls. But ""it was over before I knew"", she says. Others say they didn't experience any discomfort - like Megan Burns, a social media content creator living in Brighton. ""It was nothing,"" says Megan, who had her first screening in September aged 25. ""I couldn't feel anything."" She says the fact she'd already had two children made her less anxious about the experience. Megan Burns Megan says that the fact she'd had two children made her cervical screening seem much less daunting ""These nurses have seen everything,"" Megan adds. Some people feel under pressure to shave their pubic hair or wear their best underwear, she says. But speaking as a former healthcare worker, Megan says ""you're there to do a job, you don't care about these things"". While most people only feel light pain at their appointments, some people do experience more discomfort at their appointments. ""Some people find cervical screening uncomfortable, but it shouldn't be painful,"" the Eve Appeal says . It notes that some conditions like endometriosis, vaginismus and being menopausal can make the screening painful. The NHS says that patients are in control of screening and ""can ask the nurse to stop at any time"". Did you know about the adjustments available? People can ask for adjustments to make their screening easier or more comfortable. These include: A smaller speculum (the tube-shaped tool that's inserted into the vagina to help the nurse to take the sample) A longer appointment so you're not rushed More lubrication Moving to a different position Inserting or guiding the speculum yourself Bringing a friend for support But very few people are aware they can request these accommodations, according to recent research by the Eve Appeal. Less than a quarter of people surveyed said they knew they could request a smaller speculum and only 12% said they knew they could ask for a double appointment. Some of the people the BBC spoke to said they weren't aware they could have asked for accommodations. Bianca says she asked the nurse to use a smaller speculum after reading about it online. But she thinks information about adjustments should be flagged more clearly when you book the appointment, because some need to be thought about in advance - like bringing a friend or booking a double slot. What is it like to have the test as a transgender man? Jack Latham, a 28-year-old personal trainer living in Kent, says he received his first screening invite aged 25, just after he came out as trans. He says his GP was ""incredibly supportive"" and there was even a poster in his surgery's waiting room encouraging trans men to have a cervical screening. Trans and non-binary people who have a cervix should still have regular cervical screenings . Jack says he'd put off the appointment out of fear, until he went for a blood test in summer 2024 and the nurse offered him a cervical screening on the spot. Katie Reynolds Jack says his GP was ""incredibly supportive"" ""It was so much quicker and much less of a bigger deal,"" Jack says. ""It's nowhere near as bad as you think it will be."" Some trans men previously told the BBC they had not been invited to get cervical screenings because they were listed as male on medical records, though they still had a cervix. How could the process be improved? The NHS wants to encourage more people to go for their cervical screenings. NHS England has promised to eliminate cervical cancer by 2040. Women aged 25-49 are encouraged to have a screening every three years, while women aged 50-64 should have one every five years. NHS England data from March 2024 showed 44.5% of women aged 25-29 had not been screened in the last 3.5 years. For those aged 30-34, this figure was 35.3%. The proportion of younger women who have been adequately screened has been falling a little in recent years. Dr Sue Mann, NHS national clinical director for women's health, told the BBC in a statement that medics know that some women find screenings ""very worrying and uncomfortable"". She emphasised that adjustments are always available and that women should book their screenings, even if they were invited months or years ago. A display at the Vagina Museum in east London last year encouraged visitors to write improvements they'd like to see to the NHS's cervical screening service on slips of paper. Ella Clancy @designermakerella Artist Ella Clancy's exhibition at the Vagina Museum asked visitors to write down changes they'd like made to the cervical screening process Artist Ella Clancy, who produced the display, says common requests included more information about the adjustments available - especially asking for smaller speculums - nurses talking people through exactly what they were doing as they performed the screening and staff being more trauma-aware. Eleanor says there should be more education around what HPV is. School pupils are typically vaccinated against HPV between year eight and year 10 but Eleanor says it wasn't clear at the time what the jab was for. Jessica thinks doctors should explain the results using plainer language, and says she had to call her GP for further explanation after receiving her results letter. Would you rather do the test yourself? Some people prefer to carry out medical tests in the comfort of their own homes where possible. Do-it-yourself cervical tests are available in some countries, and researchers at King's College London trialled them in London in 2021 with ""fantastic"" results. They involve doing a vaginal swab which is then sent to a lab. The NHS said last year it was assessing whether to roll the scheme out more widely. Eleanor says she felt ""reassured"" knowing that a healthcare professional performed her first screening, but would try doing an at-home version of the test after that if the option were available. Jack, on the other hand, has his doubts. He says he'd prefer an at-home kit for ""the convenience and flexibility"" but that he'd ""have some hesitation about whether I'd done it correctly"".

05eb4f8a2bdc,Is the system letting down people who were harmed by Covid vaccines?,,"Is the system letting down people who were harmed by Covid vaccines? Fergus Walsh Medical editor BBC There is nothing in life that is free of risk. That includes vaccines. But the evidence is compelling that the benefits of getting immunised with those vaccines recommended in the UK far outweigh the possibility of serious side effects. The level of benefit from Covid vaccines is well documented. And the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine is credited with saving more lives in the first year of its use than any other - 6.3m globally compared to 5.9m for Pfizer/BioNTech’s jab. However, we need to discuss not just the huge positives that Covid vaccines brought, but also the small minority left injured or bereaved by the AstraZeneca vaccine. Around 50 families affected by rare blood clots have begun a group legal action for compensation under the Consumer Protection Act, arguing that the vaccine was not as safe as the public were entitled to expect. This includes people who have been left with severe physical injuries, those who are unable to work, and bereaved families who lost a loved one due to vaccine damage. They are a tiny fraction of all those vaccinated, but that is no comfort to the families affected, who feel like they have been airbrushed out of the pandemic and that their pleas for support have been ignored. Those families include Jane and Ian Wrigley from Buckinghamshire. Jane, 62, used to run, ski and climb mountains. Now she can barely walk due to extreme weakness down her left-hand side. Handout Jane pictured at a Parkrun, before she was affected by blood clots - and with her husband Ian more recently Two weeks after receiving the AstraZeneca vaccine in March 2021, Jane was admitted to hospital. She suffered blood clots in her brain and required emergency surgery to remove part of her skull. Jane’s medical records clearly state that she suffered these blood clots as a direct side effect of the vaccine. Her husband Ian is now her full-time carer. Jane told me: “Before I had the vaccine I was a very independent, active woman doing half marathons and enjoying my life. Now I’ve lost every bit of independence.” Her case, and those of others affected by blood clots, raises serious questions about whether the system is letting down those who have suffered serious harm as a result of taking Covid vaccines. Social contract Almost 25m adults in the UK received a first dose of the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine in 2021, and nearly all those had a second. It is estimated that the Covid vaccine programme prevented over a quarter of a million hospital admissions and over 120,000 deaths in the UK up to September 2021. The side effects of vaccination are usually mild and short-lived such as a sore arm, fever and fatigue. However, in the very rare event that something goes seriously wrong, we have a right to expect that we will be supported. This is a kind of social contract between individual and state. That’s where the Vaccine Damage Payment Scheme (VDPS) comes in. The VDPS was established in 1979 in the wake of a scare over the safety of the whooping cough vaccine in use at the time. The government-backed scheme offers a one-off financial payment of £120,000 in the event that, on the balance of probability, a vaccine has caused at least 60% disablement. Between the late 1970s and 2020 there were just below 6,500 claims under the scheme for all vaccines and 944 awards. Covid vaccine: Fighting for a payout The Oxford AstraZeneca vaccine is credited with saving millions of lives but it was also responsible, in rare cases, for serious side-effects - blood clots in the brain - which could be fatal. This is the story of those fighting for compensation. Watch on iPlayer But something dramatic has happened since the pandemic. There have been more than double the number of claims under the VDPS for Covid jabs than during the previous four decades for all other vaccines combined. Since the pandemic there have been almost 16,000 claims against Covid vaccines and 180 awards. Just over half of all claimants have yet to find out if they have been successful. So what is happening? Of the awards, all but a handful are for damage done by the AstraZeneca Covid vaccine, which is no longer used. There is a long list of different health conditions that qualify for a payment but the AstraZeneca jab had one specific rare side effect not seen in the mRNA vaccines produced by Pfizer and Moderna, which are now the mainstay of all Covid booster campaigns. The side effect is a type of blood clot, often in the brain, combined with low platelet levels, almost always within a few weeks after receiving the first dose. This can cause damage in the brain and to multiple other organs. Platelets are cells that help your blood clot, and it was so unusual to see blood clots combined with low platelet levels, that experts coined a new medical term: vaccine-induced thrombosis with thrombocytopenia , or VITT. These were so unusual that the signal was not seen in the clinical trials of the vaccine involving more than 23,000 participants, but only once the jab had started being rolled out across Europe and given to millions. In mid-March 2021, a dozen European countries briefly suspended use of the AstraZeneca jab while the clots link was investigated. Then, in April that year, the UK restricted the vaccine to the over-30s, and a month later to the over-40s because it became clear that younger people were at higher risk from the clots. Several other European countries, when they resumed using the AstraZeneca vaccine, set the age limit much higher : France to those aged over 55; Germany, Italy and the Irish Republic to the over-60s. Denmark halted its use altogether. In early April 2021, safety regulators in the UK and Europe had concluded that blood clots combined with low platelets should be listed as a rare side effect. The rare syndrome was also reported among recipients of the J&J Janssen Covid jab, which uses the same type of vaccine technology , in the United States. 'Too little, too late, to too few' Sarah Moore, a solicitor with the law firm Leigh Day, says the families she represents have been driven to sue AstraZeneca because of the inadequacies of the VDPS. “The scheme offers too little, too late, to too few people,” she says. She describes the £120,000 payment as “woefully inadequate”, pointing out that the figure had not increased since 2007. Had the sum kept pace with inflation , it would now stand at £197,000. Ms Moore says some of her clients need 24-hour care, cannot wash or dress themselves, have been left with severe physical or cognitive deficits and will never work again. The case of Jane and Ian Wrigley also illustrates another criticism of the VDPS: delay. The couple waited over two years for a payment under the scheme, despite the clear-cut nature of the case. Assessments under the VDPS are done on paper and do not involve physical examination. Last year, the government announced that it had modernised the operations of the VDPS to allow cases to be processed more quickly and increased the number of staff dealing with claims from four to 80. But a huge backlog of claims has built up. Peter Schulze, 49, is another member of the group action against AstraZeneca. He too suffered VITT blood clots after receiving the AstraZeneca vaccine in April 2021 and now needs 24-hour care. His submission to the VDPS was completed in July 2022, yet he is still awaiting a decision, despite VITT blood clots being clearly mentioned in his medical records. Peter Schulze was left unable to stand or walk, lost the sight in one eye and now has difficulty reading Finally there is the 60% disablement threshold for successful claims, which has ruled out hundreds of people who are officially recognised as having been damaged by Covid vaccines. Ms Moore says she had a female client who was now blind in one eye, with other physical and psychological injuries, but was told she didn’t reach the 60% threshold. She says under normal civil claim rules, blindness in one eye could lead to compensation of more than £200,000. It was “absolutely heartbreaking”, she added, for people to be told that the vaccine has caused their injuries yet be informed they are not disabled enough to qualify for a payment. Who pays? During the pandemic, the government granted vaccine manufacturers legal indemnity .  This did not prevent people from making a claim for compensation against pharmaceutical firms, but determined who would pay in the event of a successful action. Then-Health Secretary Matt Hancock told the Commons: “We are providing indemnities in the very unexpected event of any adverse reactions that could not have been foreseen through the robust checks and procedures that have been put in place.” Ms Moore says she has not seen a copy of this legal undertaking but believes it means that the government will pick up AstraZeneca’s legal costs and would be responsible for paying compensation in the event of a successful claim. AstraZeneca made no profit from its Covid vaccine, Vaxrevia, but its total revenue in 2023 was $45.8bn (£35.1bn) with profits of $5.9bn. In May AstraZeneca withdrew Vaxrevia citing a “surplus of available updated vaccines”. The UK government did not buy any doses for its booster programmes and all Covid vaccines used in the UK for this autumn’s booster campaign are either Pfizer or Moderna, both of which use mRNA technology. Prof Adam Finn is one of the UK’s leading experts on vaccines, and throughout the pandemic was a member of the JCVI, the body which advises the government on immunisation. He was involved in key decisions on recommending the order in which the public received Covid vaccines and the age restrictions put on the AstraZeneca jab when the clots risks emerged. Prof Finn, who is professor of paediatrics at the University of Bristol, says Covid vaccines were a massive success and “really saved a lot of people's lives”. He is not involved in the legal action and believes the decisions taken in the UK around the vaccines’ use were correct. But he says the VDPS is “clearly not working as it should” and that payments should be index-linked so that they reflect changes in the cost of living. He also criticises the “very arbitrary” 60% threshold for payouts. Prof Finn adds that it’s necessary “to take a really good look” at compensation for all current and future vaccines. I point out to Prof Finn that there was a danger in a report like this that it could undermine confidence in vaccines. He rejects this: “The only way to retain trust is to be honest.” But he does think the inadequacies of the VDPS risk undermining that public confidence in vaccines. While only a small proportion of people have been affected, he says, “they've been very seriously harmed and that is going to attract public attention. It's going to be reported, and people are going to reflect on that, and people will want to see those people treated fairly”. In a statement, AstraZeneca said:  “We cannot comment on ongoing litigation. Our sympathy goes out to anyone who has lost loved ones or reported health problems. Patient safety is our highest priority."" The statement added that AstraZeneca’s vaccine “has continuously been shown to have an acceptable safety profile and regulators around the world consistently state that the benefits of vaccination outweigh the risks of extremely rare potential side effects”. The health secretary Wes Streeting recently met with people who have been injured or bereaved as a result of vaccine damage. In a statement the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) said the meeting was to “listen to their concerns” and said “the government will look closely at these as we continue to learn and apply the lessons of the pandemic”. The statement added: “Our deepest sympathies are with those who have suffered harm.” The DHSC said the administrator of the VDPS had made operational changes to the scheme in an effort to reduce the time claimants wait for an outcome. The workings of the VDPS will be considered in the next module of the Covid inquiry, which will begin taking evidence in January 2025. Ms Moore, who expects to give evidence to the inquiry, says her clients are not “anti-vax”. She says: “We are acting for people who stood up and got vaccinated. By definition they’re all pro-vaccination. This is an act to support vaccine confidence.” As for the legal action against AstraZeneca, that could drag on for years.

c59100071c2f,Clarke angered by Scotland on historic night,,"It's not every day Scotland are booed off after winning a match which puts them to within two games of automatic qualification for a World Cup, but such are the level of expectation set by Clarke's team. While the Scots weren't shooting the lights out in attack, they also allowed Belarus to be comfortable for large parts of the game. The fact they had 10 shots more than Scotland is a huge cause for concern. ""At half-time the manager came in but he was absolutely furious with us,"" said defender Scott McKenna. ""We didn't win any first balls, didn't win any second balls either. Belarus probably looked more dangerous than us over the 90 minutes."" Despite the fury, self-reflection and pain, Scotland are still in a strong position. An away game in Athens against a Greece team who can no longer catch them, and then a Hampden showdown against Denmark next month lies in wait. Everyone from the Scotland camp who spoke acknowledged what they've produced over the past week will not get the job done, but there is a belief that they have it in them to find solutions. Somehow. ""We've had some great moments, and some quite disappointing moments,"" said Clarke. ""What we are is quite resilient, we can come back from a down. ""I'm confident in this group of players, that when it comes to the crunch we'll be ready.""",https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/c3dn99r75d1o,Sports,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/branded_sport/1200/cpsprodpb/d8db/live/9def0630-a7a7-11f0-928c-71dbb8619e94.jpg,2025-10-12T20:11:32.962000+00:00,d36a0e7f0e910786b445d882e17d6342a0e0277f
5ddffbc51114,'Australia break new ground to leave Healy one mountain to climb',,"That it took until Sunday's three-wicket win over India for them to complete their first ODI chase over 300, taking back their record for the highest in the women's 50-over format, is, in truth, a compliment to the bowlers that have worn canary yellow (OK, Australia gold) over the past 50 years. It is hard for their batters to hold a record if never given the chance. Ultimately, the result of Australia conceding 330 was captain Alyssa Healy being given an opportunity to produce her latest masterpiece. Then best known as the 19-year-old niece of renowned former Aussie wicketkeeper Ian, she debuted in 2010 after her nation failed to win either of the 20 or 50-over World Cups held the previous year and has seen it all through 15 trophy-laden years since. A T20 World Cup win came three months after her bow and seven world titles have followed from 10 attempts across formats. The gritty keeper was also there in Derby in 2017 when a semi-final defeat by India briefly halted the run of success. That loss ""drove us to rethink our standards,"" Healy said this week. At the next 50-over World Cup in New Zealand, Healy made 170 against England in the final and was named player of the tournament. She ensured her country would not fall short again. Whether this latest epic knock topped that previous effort can be debated. Some will argue the case for the pressure of a final. Others can counter with the challenge that comes when facing a record target and a raucous India-supporting crowd of 20,000. What is certain is this century was far harder to see coming. The Christchurch carnage in 2022 came as she topped the run-scoring charts, but this knock followed six innings in India since the start of last month in which she had failed to pass 30. ""If you've been watching me in the nets, it's been a frustrating experience because I feel like I've had no rhythm whatsoever,"" said Healy. ""But once you step out on the field, your competitive instincts kick in and you just lock into the contest.""",https://www.bbc.com/sport/cricket/articles/c70800rk405o,Sports,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/branded_sport/1200/cpsprodpb/e341/live/ae0d2310-a7ae-11f0-b741-177e3e2c2fc7.jpg,2025-10-12T21:03:24.659000+00:00,9616d8f18ff7678d523fc73a142c27e0363fe1bb
e95c7164e006,"Three players, 57 goals - who is the best striker?",,"England's top goalscorer Kane has notched 18 goals for Bayern in 10 games this season, including 11 in the Bundesliga and four in the Champions League - plus that one goal for his country. He has netted 47% of Bayern's 38 goals this season. Only Augsburg and amateurs Andorra have kept him out in his 19 matches for club and country so far. He has hat-tricks against Leipzig and Hoffenheim. If Kane kept this Bundesliga scoring rate up all season, he would end on 62 goals. Nobody has ever scored that many in any of Europe's major leagues. The Bundesliga record is the 41 that Lewandowski netted for Bayern in 2020-21. Tottenham's all-time top scorer has won Germany's version of the Golden Boot in both seasons for Bayern, with 36 goals and then 26 goals, to add to his three Premier League awards. A repeat this time around would make him only the second person to win three in a row in the Bundesliga after Lewandowski (who won five in a row). That would also put him joint third on the list of award winners, along with Karl-Heinz Rummenigge and Ulf Kirsten. Lewandowski and Bayern icon Gerd Muller won seven each.

828aa215bdec,How can Scotland qualify for 2026 World Cup?,,"Scotland and Denmark are both on 10 points. The Danes have a handsome goal difference advantage of six goals, and that is the first deciding factor if teams are level on points - not head-to-head. However, Scotland will be hoping they can get the job done without the need for such messiness. We can probably assume Denmark will beat point-less Belarus at home in November - having thrashed them 6-0 last week - which would move them to 13 points. If Scotland beat an already-out Greece in Athens, they would match that tally, setting up an high-anxiety decider at Hampden. A draw in that one on 18 November would almost certainly favour the Danes, given the goal difference disparity. Should the Scots draw in Athens, victory over Denmark would still be enough to win the group. However, defeat for Scotland in Greece, coupled with a Denmark win over Belarus, would mean an extraordinary victory is required in that final game to give Clarke's side any chance of automatic qualification.",https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/cqxzxe7g9j0o,Sports,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/branded_sport/1200/cpsprodpb/d804/live/98259d50-a7b0-11f0-928c-71dbb8619e94.jpg,2025-10-12T07:35:07.039000+00:00,93d4949c035f2b5b74786ec8bc5bea9594935f24

Littler, 18, was knocked out in the first round of the 'double-in and double-out' tournament on debut last year, but was more impressive throughout this campaign. His average was lower than Humphries' in the final, but he was ruthless throughout, winning five of his six sets in final-leg deciders to claim the Â£120,000 prize money. It gives Littler his seventh PDC major televised title - the joint seventh-highest in history.

173b93a657c3,Nagelsmann did not mean 'any disrespect' to NI,,"Germany manager Julian Nagelsmann says Northern Ireland have a ""special way"" of playing and he did not mean any offence with his comments after his side's 3-1 win in Cologne last month. The four-time World Cup winners will take on Michael O'Neill's side again at Windsor Park in World Cup qualifying on Monday evening. After the September meeting, Nagelsmann described Northern Ireland as ""not brilliant to watch"" and they ""played a lot of long balls"". Speaking on BBC NI's coverage of the game in Germany, former Northern Ireland defender Stephen Craigan felt the description ""was a bit disrespectful"" to his old side. Last week, O'Neill said that it was not his job to set up the team to the benefit of opposing managers. On Sunday, Nagelsmann said his characterisation of Northern Ireland's style was intended ""with a lot of respect"".

Aoba Fujino's 86th minute winner at Anfield on Sunday was their sixth in the 80th minute or later this season - 35% of their WSL goals under Jeglertz. ""It says a lot about our side. There's something special with this group. No matter if we're one goal down. You see a team saying: OK we need to do something about this,"" Jeglertz told Sky Sports. City have now won six points from losing positions in the WSL this season, more than any other side. The top scorers have scored in all six of their outings, something no other side has managed. City have had nine different scorers this season - more than any other side - easing the burden on Khadija Shaw, and potentially lessening the drop-off that was suffered whenever she was absent last season. ""The style of play we used to play was very much the same way Pep [Guardiola] wants to play with the men's,"" full-back Kerstin Casparij told Sky Sports recently. ""We've let go a little bit of that at times and have been a bit more free and direct, especially up top. ""For me that translates into having a lot more freedom, progressing on the pitch and being trusted in my instincts."" What's particularly impressive about City's goalscoring exploits and their ability to stay in matches until the end is that they are doing so without several key players.

Ghana booked their spot thanks to a 1-0 win over Comoros with Tottenham's Mohammed Kudus claiming the only goal.

Algeria joined them on Thursday with Riyad Mahrez scoring in a 3-0 Group G win over bottom side Somalia.

Penge held a four-shot lead over nearest challenger Joel Girrbach going into the final round, while he was five shots better off than Brown. However, he only had a one-shot advantage going to the 18th on Sunday after his lead was trimmed. After Penge made par to finish with a one-over 72 for his final round at the Club de Campo, Brown sank a birdie putt for a 67 which forced a play-off as both finished on 15 under. At the first time of asking in the sudden-death play-off, Penge birdied the 18th with an eight-foot putt to secure a third European Tour title of the season. Penge's victory in Spain also means he has automatically qualified for the 154th Open at Royal Birkdale next year as well at the Masters at Augusta. ""It was a strange day for me,"" said Penge, who carded 66, 67 and 64 in his first three rounds. ""I had it in my head that the golfing gods were kind of against me in a way. Dan and Joel played great, they were holing putts and putting the pressure on me. ""I just couldn't get it in the hole. It felt like I was really up against it, but I felt like I managed myself really well."" Penge was given a three-month ban in December 2024 for placing bets on multiple events, with one month suspended for a year. He has resumed his career in fine fashion and said: ""I think tee to green I played solid and it was just a matter of the putts - I think I used them all yesterday, but holing that one [on the play-off hole] was worth the wait.""

In a condition set by a judge, the 38-year-old had to be processed, which involved him having his fingerprints recorded and a head and shoulders photo taken, at Marion County Jail after leaving hospital. He was then released and briefly spoke to a reporter, saying he was slowly recovering from multiple stab wounds to his torso. ""Sorry I can't answer all your questions,"" he said, adding that his recovery would be ""a long process"". Sanchez, a pundit for Fox Sports since 2021, was in Indianapolis to commentate on a game between the Indianapolis Colts and the Las Vegas Raiders on Sunday, 5 October.

67ed44b61f86,Mpome 'up and about' after being knocked out at Arsenal,,"Brighton defender Maelys Mpome is ""up and about"" after being knocked out during their Women's Super League defeat at Arsenal on Sunday.

There was a 10-minute break in play after Mpome was struck in the face by a ball during the second half at Emirates Stadium.

Several medics attended to the French defender, who had to be taken from the field on a stretcher, with her head in a brace and receiving oxygen. It was later confirmed she had also suffered a concussion.

But Brighton manager Dario Vidosic said Mpome was with her team-mates in the changing room after the game.

""I just asked for a quick update,"" Vidosic told BBC Sport. ""They said she is up and about, and she is having a shower which is positive news.

""Fingers crossed that she is OK. That's always the most important thing - that the players all come off the field as healthy as they stepped on it.""

Vidosic said that concern from Mpome's team-mates may have had an impact on their performance as Brighton chased an equaliser.

Brighton trailed after Marisa Olislager's own goal in the first half but improved and forced several saves from Arsenal keeper Daphne van Domselaar.

But they failed to create many openings after Mpome's injury, with the home side coming closer to scoring in the final moments.

""It's never nice to see your team-mate get hurt,"" Vidosic said. ""Maybe that did play a part, fatigue as well.

""We tried to push everyone as much as we could in a safe way, but maybe it took the rhythm out of the game with the 10-minute pause.""

Mpome joined Brighton from WSL champions Chelsea in the summer and was making her fifth league appearance for the Seagulls.

89bc27b25dd8,The numbers behind O'Neill's Northern Ireland century,,"After two stints across almost 14 years, Michael O'Neill will take charge of his 100th Northern Ireland match against Germany on Monday.

It's a landmark figure for one of the greatest managers in the country's history, and he has already acknowledged the focus is on a huge World Cup qualifier rather than his own personal landmark.

But what are the numbers behind his century?

With the help of Northern Ireland's stats man Marshall Gillespie, BBC Sport NI takes a look.

O'Neill has used 94 players in his 99 Northern Ireland games to date.

There are no surprise names among his most-used players, and all played a key role in the run to Euro 2016.

Steven Davis leads the way, and he is joined by Jonny Evans at the top of the list.

Paddy McNair is the only active player in the top five, and he continues to build up the caps by playing a key role in the young current squad.

Ollie Norwood is another notable name in the list despite stepping away from Northern Ireland duty in 2018.

After he was appointed in December 2011, O'Neill first took charge of Northern Ireland in February 2012 in a 3-0 friendly defeat at home to Norway.

His starting team from that night had a number of familiar names, many of whom would help Northern Ireland qualify for Euro 2016 such as Davis, Jonny and Corry Evans, Aaron Hughes, Gareth McAuley and Shane Ferguson.

He would have to wait until August 2013 for his first win as manager as Martin Paterson's goal gave NI a 1-0 win over Fabio Capello's Russia at Windsor Park.

Here's how O'Neill's starting teams have evolved through his first match against Norway, the Euro 2016 opener with Poland, his first game back in San Marino in March 2023 and then Friday's win over Slovakia.

Of the 94 players used by O'Neill, 63 were born in Northern Ireland, while 31 qualified through eligibility.

He has handed debuts to 49 players, the last of which was Jamie McDonnell, who won his first cap off the bench in Germany in September.

Across the two spells, 14 players have been handed the captain's armband by O'Neill.

Davis' importance to Northern Ireland is evident in the 61 times he wore the armband, and Jonny Evans is the only other player to break double figures.

Since the pair retired, O'Neill has rotated the captaincy around a number of his young squad, and this can be seen that Trai Hume is next on the list with six, while Shea Charles and Conor Bradley both have led Northern Ireland three times each.

Including five opposition players, 37 men have scored the 110 goals across O'Neill's two tenures between them.

Kyle Lafferty leads the way with 12, seven of which came in qualifying for Euro 2016.

Isaac Price has burst on to the international scene and is hot on Lafferty's heels, and it feels like a matter of when, not if, he moves to the top of the list.

Hume is the latest player to add their name to the list after his superb goal against Slovakia on Friday.

In terms of percentage scored, it is fairly even across each half as 56 of the 110 goals have come in the opening 45 minutes, while 54 have arrived after the restart.

Here are the various goal milestones under Michel O'Neill:

First - Shane Ferguson v Finland (H) â August 2012

25th - Kyle Lafferty v Hungary (H) â September 2015

50th â Josh Magennis v San Marino (A) â September 2017

75th â Michael Smith v Germany (A) â November 2019

100th â Conor Bradley v Luxembourg (A) â November 2024

Assists for the 110 goals under O'Neill have been shared around 36 players, with three players tied on seven assists each.

It's no surprise to see Davis up at the top once again, while Norwood's importance from set-pieces means he is joint top.

Of course, Norwood also supplied one of the most memorable assists in Northern Ireland history when he set up Gareth McAuley to score against Ukraine at Euro 2016.

George Saville has been a regular in squads since making his debut in 2017 and, while he is yet to score a goal, has popped up with six assists.

O'Neill will join Billy Bingham in reaching a century of games in charge of Northern Ireland.

Along with Peter Doherty at the 1958 World Cup, they are the only bosses to lead Northern Ireland to a major tournament.

We've already touched on O'Neill's stats as manager, but how do they compare to Bingham?

They are actually very similar, and O'Neill only needs three more victories to have the most in NI history.

Two different eras. Two greats.

The starting XI which played in Luxembourg in the Nations League in November 2024 had an average age of just 22.2.

Not only is it the youngest starting team under O'Neill, but it was also the youngest Northern Ireland XI since the end of World War Two.

O'Neill's young side would draw 2-2 in Luxembourg after they let a two-goal lead slip.

There's a lot of focus on youth currently with O'Neill's Northern Ireland squad, but lets not forget some of the legends of his first tenure.

Gareth McAuley was the oldest player to have played under O'Neill when he won his final cap for Northern Ireland against Austria in November 2018 aged 38 years and 348 days - just a few days shy of his 39th birthday.

Aaron Hughes, another key defender for O'Neill, was 38 years and 207 days old when he made his last appearance in June 2018.

Midfielder Davis was 37 years and 269 days old when he played his final NI game in September 2022, but was robbed of a reunion with O'Neill - who returned to the role that December - due to the knee injury that would eventually force him to retire.

Two very different results from O'Neill's two stints in charge.

The biggest defeat came early in his reign and it was the first time Northern Ireland had conceded six goals in 51 years.

Robin van Persie scored twice in Amsterdam, as did Ibrahim Afellay, while Wesley Sneijder and Ron Vlaar were also on target.

In contrast, O'Neill's young team produced a five-goal performance at home to Bulgaria in October 2024.

Price scored a hat-trick, while an Dimitar Mitov own goal and Josh Magennis effort secured a famous win in Belfast.

Northern Ireland have faced 46 different countries during O'Neill's time in charge.

Luxembourg and Germany are currently tied for the most-faced opponents, and it is fitting he will bring up his 100th game when he takes on the Germans for a seventh time.

Luxembourg have also been familiar opponents, and they will also face Northern Ireland in the final World Cup qualifier in November.

Seven players have been sent off in O'Neill's 99 games as Northern Ireland manager.

What immediately jumps out is how much discipline has improved since the start of his first tenure.

Chris Brunt and Kyle Lafferty were both sent off against Cristiano Ronaldo's Portugal in September 2013, and Jonny Evans followed suit the following month in Azerbaijan.

Defender McAuley's dismissal in Cyprus made it four red cards in three international windows, while Chris Baird was controversially sent off for two fouls in the same phase of play the following year.

Charles' dismissal was the first after O'Neill's return, while Brodie Spencer was shown a rare red card in a friendly in June.

Nine players have won just one cap under O'Neill for Northern Ireland.

In his first stint in charge, James McPake and Michael O'Connor won their sole international caps under O'Neill in 2012.

A 6-0 defeat in the Netherlands was McPake's only Northern Ireland appearance, while O'Connor's 13th cap came after a four-year break away from the international set-up against Luxembourg in 2013.

Paddy Lane and Alfie McCalmont have a handful of Northern Ireland caps each, but all but one came under Ian Baraclough, while Cameron McGeehan 's sole NI cap came against San Marino in 2023.

More recently, Ronan Hale and Aaron Donnelly, Jamie McDonnell and Michael Forbes have won their sole international caps under O'Neill, although it would not be a huge surprise to see them add to their respective tallies in the future.

Not the most ground-breaking stat you will read in this article, but it provided memories to last a lifetime for everyone involved.

b64e900e614b,Park's explosive start at Man Utd as move pays off,,"It was a surprise to see Park not in the starting XI as United plotted to spoil Everton's first WSL match at the new Hill Dickinson Stadium, but it was all part of a strategy designed to unsettle the hosts. Since her move in the summer, Park has become a key figure for manager Marc Skinner, playing alongside Ella Toone in an attacking midfield set-up that is flourishing. ""I genuinely believe her and Tooney become alive and are electric together. We just have to be able to adapt and evolve it,"" said Skinner. It has come as a welcome surprise that United have been able to get the best out of Toone and Park - something that wasn't always as easy with Clinton and Toone. It is also a partnership that could benefit England, and former Lionesses striker Ellen White said Park looks more ""free"" in the role she has at United, compared to how she was used at City. ""This has been a really great move for Jess Park. There was a lot of questions but she has let her football do the talking,"" White said on the Women's Football Weekly podcast. ""She has settled in really well. She is great on the ball technically and also has good fitness levels so she will defend."" Skinner said the two were training together on Saturday, taking up shooting positions specific to a number 10 - and it paid off with Park's double at Everton. ""In training, we've been working on Jess opening up her body and where she might receive the ball and different ways to finish,"" Skinner said. ""They both [scored lots in training]. In the number 10 role you usually have one touch to set the ball, then a second to hit it. ""It was working on that speed and both were excellent."" Skinner knew Everton would be well prepared for Park given manager Brian Sorensen worked with her during a 2022-23 loan spell with the Toffees. The United boss hoped to catch his Everton dugout rival off guard and was able to use Park effectively off the bench. ""We rotated to play a winger system rather than the number 10 system. They had to adapt,"" said Skinner. ""It was nice to give her a rest, but when she came on I knew she would unlock those pockets. I just think there is loads more goals in her.""",https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/cy7p7zxx22zo,Sports,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/branded_sport/1200/cpsprodpb/331c/live/34cf19e0-a777-11f0-91a2-f3f3bd434eb5.jpg,2025-10-12T17:21:26.990000+00:00,98423761a4663b6825de85d7b8420a0c9733486d

Out wide, Hull's speedy Lewis Martin - a former Hull City youth footballer - was Super League's top scorer, but is this too early for him? Dom Young, who left Sydney Roosters for Newcastle mid-season, has been a rampaging force out wide for England, athletic and powerful. Joe Burgess has three England caps but has not been in the reckoning of late, despite scoring regularly for Salford and now Hull KR. His team-mate Tom Davies is another who does great work out of back-field as well as out wide - but he only has one cap. Liam Marshall scored on his England debut against Samoa last November, after several prolific seasons with Wigan, and will surely be considered. Herbie Farnworth, arguably one of the best players in the world, has sewn up one of the centre spots, so who goes in alongside? Jake Wardle has had another impressive season at Wigan, while Harry Newman - who Wane has shown faith in during recent series - was again a regular for Leeds.

783904322835,Healy's century helps Australia to record chase,,"Alyssa Healy's brilliant 142 helped Australia complete a record women's one-day international chase as they beat India by three wickets in the World Cup. On a featherbed pitch in Visakhapatnam, India posted a commanding 330 from 48.5 overs - the highest total Australia had ever conceded in an ODI. The platform for India was laid by a 155-run opening stand between Smriti Mandhana and Pratika Rawal, who accelerated quickly once they got themselves in. Mandhana was the chief aggressor, top-scoring with 80 off 66 balls, while a string of cameos from India's middle order continued the assault. All-rounder Annabel Sutherland swung some of the momentum back Australia's way in the second half of India's innings as she finished with impressive figures of 5-40. Lesser teams might have been daunted by the chase, but Australia captain Healy produced a stoic knock to put her side on course for victory. Healy's innings off 107 balls featured 21 fours and three sixes and was chanceless until she sliced Shree Charani, who claimed 3-41, to Sneh Rana, grapsing a diving catch with her fingernails at point. With 66 required off 67 deliveries, Ash Gardner, who made 45, steered Australia close before Kim Garth and Ellyse Perry got the World Cup holders within striking distance. Perry had retired earlier in her innings with cramp but came back to finish the job and whacked a six off Rana to get Australia over the line with six balls to spare. Australia's record-breaking ODI chase eclipsed the 302 made by Sri Lanka to beat South Africa at Potchefstroom in April 2024.",https://www.bbc.com/sport/cricket/articles/cg4249111z6o,Sports,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/branded_sport/1200/cpsprodpb/49d5/live/d0be11b0-a78d-11f0-928c-71dbb8619e94.jpg,2025-10-12T17:11:15.481000+00:00,eb605e21678b2a85272cad40eeb2b744c6bc95c5
fc59f11df28f,Smith inspires Harlequins to victory over Saracens,,"Smith, making his first club appearance of the season after touring Australia with the British and Irish Lions in the summer, needed less than nine minutes to make an impact. After Saracens failed to cleanly gather Smith's high kick into their defensive 22, Quins eventually worked the ball to their talismanic number 10, who burst through two tackles to touch down in the corner. Quins pressed to extend their advantage, but it was Saracens who scored next with a sensational team move started by Farrell's excellent short pass to Lucio Cinti, who broke clear and set up fly-half Burke to stroll over unopposed. Smith, denied a second try following intervention by the TMO because of a scrum infraction, kicked Quins three points ahead after Saracens were penalised at the reset scrum. Almost immediately after the restart, home full-back Green contested another high Smith kick, booted the loose ball ahead, and won the foot race to ground the ball near the posts to make it 17-7 after Smith's conversion. A spell of Saracens attacking pressure ended with Farrell's kick across field picking out the unmarked England and Lions back row Earl to touch down, again bringing the gap between the sides to three points with Farrell kicking the extras. But a comeback from the visitors failed to materialise in the final 15 minutes, and after Quins debutant Boris Wenger had a try ruled out by the TMO for a double movement, Smith sealed victory by knocking over another penalty with the clock past 80 minutes. Before kick-off, there was a minute's applause in memory of former Harlequins academy coach Warren Abrahams, who has died aged 43 .

Celtic's losses across the span covering the pandemic were about Â£100,000. That latitude does not exist anymore. There are more lines of command at the club. There is a squad that maybe Gerrard didn't fancy and would have wanted to change, but that freedom he had before would not be there now. Thelwell, the sporting director appointed by the owners, signed all of these guys. You could say that Saturday and last summer were the two times Gerrard custard-pied Rangers, but of course there was a third. On a Thursday in October 2021, Gerrard was interviewed after his Rangers team - reigning champions of Scotland - had beaten Brondby 2-0 in the Europe League. That week there'd been speculation linking him with Newcastle, so the rumours were put to him. ""Do I look happy?"" he asked, in a rhetorical sense. ""Do I look settled? Don't ask me silly questions then."" Five games later he was no longer Rangers manager. He went to Aston Villa and won eight games out of 31 and was sacked with Villa 17th in the Premier League. Later, he went to Al-Ettifaq in Saudi Arabia, got them to sixth in his first season and left by mutual consent after 18 months when his team fell to 12th, just five points above the relegation zone. Gerrard was the manager Rangers wanted, but he's been beaten up since he left Ibrox. There was no guarantee that they'd have been getting the hot property of 2021, the great redeemer who, eventually, stopped Celtic in their tracks. Who they will get is now anybody's guess. The Rangers board will be reeling. Chaos reigns and nobody rules.",https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/ckg2g4p9vrvo,Sports,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/branded_sport/1200/cpsprodpb/5e3e/live/63418530-a761-11f0-af68-63d6dbe14439.jpg,2025-10-12T11:51:14.465000+00:00,637777eba06a4f0503e9cf7cab503f39df8e1e01

Image source, Getty Images Image caption, Viktor Gyokeres (left), Alexander Isak (centre) and Benjamin Sesko all made high-profile transfers in the summer, joining Arsenal, Liverpool and Manchester United respectively By Michael Emons BBC Sport journalist Strikers dominated the summer transfer window as a host of major Premier League sides looked to strengthen up front. Not a day went by without speculation as reigning champions Liverpool and last season's runners-up Arsenal were among the teams to bolster their attacking options, with Manchester United and Chelsea doing likewise. We had strikers going on strike, clubs gazumping their rivals and plenty more drama along the way. With the international break ongoing, clubs are left to reflect on their seven league matches so far. But how have the big-name forward signings got on? We have taken a look at nine of them to see how they have fared - and want you to have your say. Thierno Barry (Everton) Image source, Getty Images Image caption, Among those to have played at least 180 minutes in the Premier League this season, no player averages more off-ball runs in behind per 90 minutes than Barry's 17.7 Stats from Premier League 2025-26. Appearances: 7. Minutes played: 208. Goals: 0. Assists: 0. Shots on target: 0. Chances created: 1. Everton paid Â£27m to sign 22-year-old striker Thierno Barry from Villarreal after he scored 11 La Liga goals last season. But it has been a tough start at the Toffees for the France Under-21 international. He is yet to score in nine games in all competitions and five of his seven Premier League appearances have come as a substitute, with Beto often preferred by manager David Moyes. Dominic Calvert-Lewin (Leeds United) Image source, Getty Images Image caption, Only Bournemouth's Antoine Semenyo (17) and Crystal Palace's Jean-Philippe Mateta (14) have recorded more flick-ons in the Premier League this season than Dominic Calvert-Lewin's 13 Stats from Premier League 2025-26. Appearances: 5. Minutes played: 357. Goals: 1. Assists: 0. Shots on target: 7. Chances created: 6. After scoring 57 Premier League goals for Everton in a nine-year spell, Dominic Calvert-Lewin left the Toffees on a free transfer and quickly joined newly promoted Leeds United. England international Calvert-Lewin, 28, had a chance to ""revive his career"", said Whites boss Daniel Farke, who has regularly used the striker - starting him in four of Leeds' Premier League matches so far. Calvert-Lewin got his first goal for the club, and his first since January, in Leeds' 3-1 win at Wolves on 20 September, but that remains his only goal of the campaign. Hugo Ekitike (Liverpool) Image source, Getty Images Image caption, Hugo Ekitike has a shot accuracy of 40% in the Premier League this season and no summer signing has scored more than him so far Stats from Premier League 2025-26. Appearances: 6. Minutes played: 386. Goals: 3. Assists: 1. Shots on target: 4. Chances created: 4. France international Ekitike was a wanted man in the summer, with Newcastle United the first club to make a bid for him. With Liverpool initially being frustrated in their efforts to sign Alexander Isak from the Magpies, the Reds quickly made a move themselves - signing him for an initial Â£69m from Eintracht Frankfurt. To Newcastle's frustration, Liverpool also went on to sign Isak. The 23-year-old has proved an instant hit with the fans, although question marks remain around how he and Isak will fit into the champions' team together. Ekitike has scored three goals and has one assist so far, but was sent off after taking his shirt off while celebrating a late winner against Southampton in the Carabao Cup. Viktor Gyokeres (Arsenal) Image source, Getty Images Image caption, Only Manchester United's Bryan Mbeumo (108) and Aston Villa's Ollie Watkins (100) have made more off-ball runs in behind in the Premier League this season than Gyokeres' 86. He has also had the joint-third most touches in the opposition's box (45) Stats from Premier League 2025-26. Appearances: 7. Minutes played: 578. Goals: 3. Assists: 0. Shots on target: 5. Chances created: 5. Sweden international Viktor Gyokeres scored 54 goals in 52 games in 2024-25 and helped Sporting win a second successive Portuguese league title before moving to Arsenal in the summer. The Gunners signed the 27-year-old in a deal that could be worth up to Â£64m, and he has been a vital part of the side that sits on top of the Premier League table. He has started all seven of their league games, scoring twice in the 5-0 win over Leeds and once in the 3-0 victory over Nottingham Forest, and has also started in both of Arsenal's Champions League victories. Alexander Isak (Liverpool) Image source, Getty Images Image caption, Only Arsenal's Leandro Trossard (0.62) has a higher xG (expected goals) among players without a shot on target in the Premier League this season than Alexander Isak's 0.61 Stats from Premier League 2025-26. Appearances: 3. Minutes played: 181. Goals: 0. Assists: 1. Shots on target: 0. Chances created: 1. Alexander Isak's protracted transfer from Newcastle to Liverpool was the story of the summer window. The Sweden striker released a statement in which he said promises had been ""broken"" by Newcastle and that their ""relationship can't continue"" after Liverpool's first bid was rejected, before he finally moved on transfer deadline day for a British record of Â£125m. But, without much of a pre-season, Isak, 26, has made a slow start at Liverpool. He is yet to have a shot on target after his first three Premier League games, although he has registered an assist and scored in a 2-1 win over Southampton in the Carabao Cup. Igor Jesus (Nottingham Forest) Image source, Getty Images Image caption, Among strikers with 10 or more aerial duels in the Premier League this season, only Manchester City's Erling Haaland (84.2% - 16/19) has a higher success rate than Igor Jesus' 60% (6/10) Stats from Premier League 2025-26. Appearances: 6. Minutes played: 101. Goals: 0. Assists: 0. Shots on target: 2. Chances created: 1. Brazil international striker Igor Jesus joined Nottingham Forest in a Â£10m move from Botafogo in July. It has been a tough start to the campaign for Forest, who are without a win in nine games in all competitions and sacked Nuno Espirito Santo, replacing him with Ange Postecoglou in September. Jesus, 24, is yet to score in the Premier League but has scored four goals in cup competitions - two in the 3-2 Carabao Cup loss to Swansea City and then another double a week later, when Forest drew 2-2 with Real Betis in the Europa League. Joao Pedro (Chelsea) Image source, Getty Images Image caption, Only Manchester City's Erling Haaland (10) and Bournemouth's Antoine Semenyo (nine) have more goal involvements in the Premier League this season than Joao Pedro's five (two goals, three assists) Stats from Premier League 2025-26. Appearances: 7. Minutes played: 586. Goals: 2. Assists: 3. Shots on target: 3. Chances created: 7. Chelsea completed a deal worth Â£60m to take Brazil forward Joao Pedro from Brighton on an eight-year contract, and he headed straight to the United States to play at the Club World Cup. His two goals in the semi-final helped beat Fluminense and he then scored against European champions Paris St-Germain as Chelsea won the final. In the Premier League he has scored twice and assisted three goals, although he has not scored in his past six games in all competitions. However, with Cole Palmer and another new Blues striker Liam Delap, a Â£30m summer signing from Ipswich Town, both injured, Joao Pedro, 24, is leading the Chelsea line every week. Benjamin Sesko (Manchester United) Image source, Getty Images Image caption, No player has scored more goals from inside the six-yard box in the Premier League this season than Benjamin Sesko's two Stats from Premier League 2025-26. Appearances: 7. Minutes played: 385. Goals: 2. Assists: 0. Shots on target: 6. Chances created: 5. Manchester United completed the signing of RB Leipzig striker Benjamin Sesko in a move worth Â£73.7m in August. The 22-year-old Slovenia international's first start came as United suffered a humiliating Carabao Cup exit to League Two side Grimsby Town, who won 12-11 on penalties, with Sesko criticised as he was the last of 10 United outfielders to take a spot-kick in the shootout. However, he has scored twice in recent weeks, in the 3-1 loss against Brentford on 27 September and then again seven days later in the 2-0 victory over Sunderland. Nick Woltemade (Newcastle United) Image source, Getty Images Image caption, No player has more headed goals in the Premier League this season than his two, which is as many as he scored in his 70 appearances in the Bundesliga Stats from Premier League 2025-26. Appearances: 4. Minutes played: 305. Goals: 3. Assists: 0. Shots on target: 3. Chances created: 2. With Alexander Isak making it clear he wanted to move from Newcastle to Liverpool, Eddie Howe moved to sign 23-year-old Germany striker Nick Woltemade. The 6ft 6in (1.98m) frontman joined in a club record deal worth up to Â£69m and has already made an impact. He scored the only goal on his debut in a 1-0 win against Wolves and has also netted against Arsenal, Union St-Gilloise in the Champions League and against Nottingham Forest.",https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/cx2xzxgw1qgo,Sports,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/branded_sport/1200/cpsprodpb/84f4/live/f1938710-a3de-11f0-92db-77261a15b9d2.png,2025-10-12T06:18:13.047000+00:00,c0aa4dac912b846993af64927372fcf12666a4b5
1d64a2877934,Former Wales women head coach Abrahams dies aged 43,,"Former Wales women's head coach Warren Abrahams has died, aged 43.

Belgium Rugby announced that the South Africa-born coach died while with the national women's team at the Safari 7s tournament in Kenya.

The Belgium rugby federation said it was shocked and saddened by the sudden loss.

""Warren was so much more than a coach, he was a mentor, a leader and above all, a kind and generous human being,"" the federation added.

""His smile, wisdom and calm strength he brought ton the team will never be forgotten.""

Abrahams coached Harlequins' academy between 2011 and 2019 and went on to work on the sevens management teams with USA women and England men.

He was appointed head coach of Wales women in November 2020 but left the following summer after less than nine months in the role.

The Welsh Rugby Union said: ""Our sincerest condolences to the family and friends of Warren Abrahams from everyone in Welsh rugby.""

Abrahams worked as a consultant with Brazil's women's sevens team before joining Belgium earlier this year.

Harlequins said: ""His passion, leadership and commitment to developing players were felt not only at Harlequins, but throughout the wider rugby world during his distinguished career.""",https://www.bbc.com/sport/rugby-union/articles/c4gqgk12e47o,Sports,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/branded_sport/1200/cpsprodpb/d0fb/live/419a90b0-a77b-11f0-9f5f-19b03c1693c8.jpg,2025-10-12T14:12:32.064000+00:00,397169354a66bdbefd718cbacbc3d13b8fccfdd8
a38acc2e007c,Broncos survive scare to beat Jets in London,,"The Jets' defence looked set to struggle against Denver's run game. Broncos running back JK Dobbins came in fifth in the league for rushing yards (402) while the Jets had conceded an average of 31.4 points (second most) and 140 rushing yards per game (sixth most). The Jets also became the first team not to claim a single takeaway in their first five games of the season, since the NFL began tracking turnovers in 1933. But it was the Jets' defence and special teams unit that stepped up at Tottenham, accounting for eight of their 11 points. They ended their turnover drought with a fumble recovery on the game's very first drive before making a 72-yard kick-off return, which set up two field goals. The Jets then forced Denver to punt on five of their next six possessions and earned a safety on the other, before the Broncos could finally do some damage on the ground to earn what proved to be the game-winning field goal. It is testimony to the Jets' defence that they almost won despite earning just 82 yards on offence and -10 passing yards, as they lost 55 yards as a result of the nine sacks. It was their offensive line that was found wanting on this occasion. New head coach Glenn is getting close to his first win. Four of the Jets' six defeats have been one-score games. But he needs some semblance of an all-round team performance if they are to finally get over the hump. Glenn said that, in certain moments, Fields should have released the ball sooner. ""This is probably our best game on defence, but our passing game was non-existent,"" Glenn said. ""When you have a team that pressures that much and plays that much man coverage, sometimes you've just got to give your guys a chance to win a one-on-one. ""It's tough being close.

ebaba84ec15d,Who do Rangers fans want after Gerrard news?,,"Former Sheffield Wednesday boss Danny Rohl is reportedly the new favourite, but there appears to be no consensus about who Rangers should turn to next. Heart of Midlothian's Derek McInnes, St Mirren's Stephen Robinson, Livingston's David Martindale, former Liverpool boss Rafael Benitez, Coventry City's Frank Lampard, former caretaker Barry Ferguson, St Johnstone's Simo Valakari, former Wolverhampton Wanderers boss Gary O'Neil, former Everton manager Sean Dyche, ex-Aberdeen boss Neil Warnock, Marco Rose, formerly of RB Leipzig, Bodo/Glimt's Kjetil Knutsen, Shanghai Port's Kevin Muscat... take your pick. Graeme: I'm worried what message Gerrard's decision will send to other potential interested potential candidates and fans. Is it about available funds not being there for strengthening the squad? I'd love to see Benitez come, but I suspect another second-rate manager is on the cards. Mark: Why not look nearer to home - Stephen Robinson or David Martindale? Both solid performance. Gerrard left, so he should not have had the chance to come back. Or, if you want top notch, Rafael Benitez is free. David: I am glad he turned it down. Never forgiven him for leaving like he did last time, nor will I ever. Danny Rohl is the man for me. Donald: Not to keen on Steven Gerrard coming back, plus Russell Martin has ruined the team as he brought in too many duds. Derek McInnes was my favourite, but it won't happen this time round. Kenny: I'm sure Gerrard will return as Rangers boss one day. It looks like financial restraints are too much for him at this time, which is fair enough. However, the Rangers directors need to get it right this time. We need someone with experience and a proven track record. Jeff: If Lampard, McInnes or Ferguson are not announced, it's going to be Groundhog Day, but it'll be the board as well as Stewart and Thelwell who will come under pressure this time. Douglas: Simo Valakari would me my top choice. He has and is proving his ability in Scotland at St Johnstone with an enjoyable brand of football. Rangers should give him the opportunity before another club from England or Europe steps in. Edward: Barry and Neil [McCann] and Billy [Dodds] and Allan [McGregor] should be back as soon as possible. They did well in difficult circumstances last season. Martin: Gary O'Neil is a good person. Tam: Derek McInnes or Barry Ferguson are the only two that know Rangers and Scottish football. Nigel: Deflated. I think he would given everyone an immediate lift. Any manager we appoint now from the current names suggested would involve a settling in period trying to win over sceptics, which is how Martin started. McInnes or Ferguson for me. Susi: They need to appoint someone who is not just in it for the money. They need to have a bit of passion about the club. Frank: Never wanted Gerrard back. Said he wants to return to management with a club expected to win trophies as he believes that suits him. That's why he left for Aston Villa, then the Arab League - really? Should never have been considered. Potter is available and, given a five-year deal and left to get on with it, would be successful. Guy: Good decision by Gerrard. The players are poor, don't like criticism and the fans toxic and no sort of leadership from the owners. I like Rangers, but if you are a progressive manager, you don't touch. The people who sort the club out in respect of managers are Dyche or Neil Warnock - they need strong leaders who won't take crap from over-rated players. Ruaridh: I'm astonished that nobody seems to be mentioning Stephen Robinson for the Rangers vacancy. He knows Scottish football inside out and has always produced good footballing teams (and encouraged young talent) without having huge amounts of money to spend. He's just 10 minutes down the road too! We don't need a high-profile manager. We just need a good manager and Stephen Robinson is exactly that. Peter: Surprised. Disappointed but certainly not gutted. For me, Derek McInnes was and remains the clear number one choice, so hopefully Rangers now push the boat out to get him. Possibly a blessing in disguise. John: I never understood the desperation to get Gerrard in. His profile was the only aspect, because I do think they need a big character/name. Rohl is a gamble. They need a Lampard or Southgate to come in. William: I'm in the minority. I'm glad as it took him three years to win a title. We need a Graeme Souness -type manager who won't let players just turn up to get their huge salaries. A hard, experienced pro. David: I have said all along that Barry Ferguson and his staff is a natural selection to be manager. He has the commitment, the passion the respect of players and fans and the ability to mould a successful team to challenge Celtic. Ally: What they should have done in the first place and try get Derek McInnes. If he doesn't want to leave Hearts, it's got to be Barry with his same team again. They will set us up properly and go back to what Rangers used to be and have a strong Scottish base who know the league and the pressure playing for Rangers will bring. Bill: If Ange Postecoglou is sacked at Nottingham Forest, Rangers would be mad not to take him on board. He has a fantastic proven record in Scotland and is a brilliant tactician and man-manager. Would the owners be brave enough? Boaby: Personally I would go for Marco Rose, although there is no guarantee he would be interested. The obvious alternative is Mr McInnes, who had Walter Smith's endorsement, which is more than good enough for me. John: I'm actually glad Gerrard turned down Rangers. He's not what Rangers need. It's understandable to want to go back to the guy that last won something for the club. But he didn't take the club forward. Steve Cooper can and would take Rangers forward. Yet he's never been considered or even linked to the position. Chris: So glad Gerrard is not coming back. Let him go somewhere else to try to get his mojo back. Only one trophy winner in the names being banded about. Appoint Kevin Muscat now please and don't consider the other mediocre ""did well from limited resources or staved off relegation"" candidates please. Euan: Don't believe the statement for a minute. If timing wasn't right, why commit to the talks in the first place. Senior exec team at Rangers are displaying a concerning lack of football knowledge, fishing in a small pool of the footballs' unemployed/recently sacked. Why not be bold and try and tempt Kjetil Knutsen from Bodo/Glimt or someone else who is actually currently doing a good job? Callum: Whilst it would have been good to see Stevie back, we need a manager with experience to turn the squad around. So long as it is not another Martin-esque appointment like Rohl. Ian: I think Rangers should seek out Billy Davies for their next manager. He has a good record as a manager and was a good player for Rangers and knows what it means to play for them.",https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/clyxy0yvn4po,Sports,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/branded_sport/1200/cpsprodpb/daa8/live/001293e0-a75d-11f0-a302-6bcd0f505684.jpg,2025-10-12T11:20:06.499000+00:00,3552e6bc4abc2d8cc6fa708a3708ac41e7cb954a

American Schauffele carded a final-round 64, featuring eight birdies, to finish one shot clear of compatriot Max Greyserman on 19-under at Yokohama Country Club. It was Schauffele's first event since the United States' Ryder Cup defeat by Europe at Bethpage Black in New York. The 31-year-old struggled with a rib injury at the start of the year which disrupted the momentum generated by his 2024 Open victory at Royal Troon, which came only two months after his maiden major win at the PGA Championship. Schauffele said he ""definitely had doubts"" about whether he would win another title again. ""I think every player in any sport, at some point in time you feel like you're on top of the world and then you feel like, not that you've lost it, but you feel less confident,"" said the American, who won Olympic gold in Tokyo in 2021. ""It was a rough year but my team dragged me through it. They pick me up when I'm down. ""Hopefully I'm catching my stride. It was a big learning experience with the injury this year."" Schauffele added that it was ""special"" to win in Japan, where his mother grew up and his grandparents still live. Michael Thorbjornsen, who briefly tied for the lead after an eagle at the fourth hole, finished three strokes behind Schauffele in third on 16 under par. Schauffele's Ryder Cup team-mate Collin Morikawa finished tied for 14th on 10 under.

Kane, by his own standards, had a disappointing Euro 2024, looking so jaded there was a clamour for England's captain to be replaced by Aston Villa's Ollie Watkins. He was substituted in every one of England's knockout matches, including after only 61 minutes of the final loss to Spain in Berlin - and yet still finished as the tournament's joint top scorer with three goals from seven games. Kane is England's highest goalscorer in major tournaments, with 15 goals from 29 games. This total puts him fifth, when ranking combined European Championship and World Cup goals, behind Cristiano Ronaldo and Germany trio Miroslav Klose, Gerd Muller and Jurgen Klinsmann. So has his stellar contribution been underappreciated? Sutton says: ""Anybody who has played either with or against him, raves about him. ""If people do not give him the credit he deserves, it may be because he's been England's main man for so long. People are sometimes there to chop you down. ""England players get judged on major tournaments and if they don't win it the criticism comes, with the high-profile captain usually first in that firing line. ""You can have rivalries, tribalism and social media, and there will be people who put the boot in, but you won't get anyone who has played the game to a reasonable level having any doubts about him. And I think most fair-minded supporters recognise what a player Harry Kane is."" Sutton added: ""He has never been blessed with great pace but the way his brain works is fantastic. He's not just a phenomenal goalscorer. He has the ability to drop deep to influence games, showing wonderful awareness, weight of passing, vision."" Former England defender Matthew Upson, who played against Kane and watches him regularly as a BBC Radio 5 Live pundit, says: ""The phrase 'you don't know what you've got until it's gone' springs to mind with Harry. ""I also think what plays into that is Kane's profile. For the scale of what he does, I think he keeps his profile quite low. ""He is quite understated in the way he operates, being the figure he is in world football.

Matthews benefited from the late withdrawals of Charles-Barclay and American Taylor Knibb to finish second behind Norway's Solveig Lovseth, who claimed her first Ironman world title. Charles-Barclay, the 2023 champion, was leading after 10 miles of the marathon but visibly began to struggle as temperatures pushed 28C with 70% humidity. She eventually pulled out with about nine miles remaining after consulting with her husband at the side of the road. That seemingly left the path clear for Knibb to take the title, but the 27-year-old withdrew with four miles left, sitting down on the tarmac as Lovseth and Matthews ran past her. Matthews finished strongly and completed the marathon in a course record two hours, 47 minutes, but it was not enough to reel in Lovseth. The Norwegian crossed the line in a time of eight hours, 28 minutes and 27 seconds, with Matthews just 35 seconds behind for her third Ironman silver medal. Germany's Laura Philipp was more than eight minutes further back in third. ""I worked really hard and I'm very proud of my finish,"" said Matthews.

A player's expected goals number (xG) signifies how many goals a Premier League player has historically scored from the number and quality of chances he has had. It is not a number randomly picked by statistics boffins, but by Premier League history. And if we look at players' xG in the Premier League so far this season from normal play, the Norway forward is getting so many more good opportunities to score than anyone else.

After receiving another Â£500,000 from Sport England, Bafa has launched a new strategy to develop the UK game's governance, infrastructure and participation pyramid, which now includes more than 10,000 players and 150 clubs. And since the women's team became back-to-back European champions, more potential sponsors have expressed their interest.

Manchester United were dominating English football. Hatton was playing his part in the ring and also giving his Manchester City-supporting backers something to cheer while their team struggled in the Red Devils' shadow. In the city centre, a new venue opened and staged a Torvill and Dean performance on its opening night. ""It was fortunate that they built the Manchester Arena when they did,"" said Speak of the indoor venue that welcomed its first customers in 1995. This is where Hatton had 15 of his professional fights. ""It would become his fortress,"" Speak said. By the time Hatton fought Kostya Tszyu in 2005, he was selling out the arena. Hatton stopped the man who was regarded as the world's best light-welterweight to win the IBF title. Danny Jackson, a close friend to Hatton and Manchester City's matchday announcer, delivered an emotional speech in memory of his pal at the recent City-United derby.

5fc2562ff7cd,'The players will decide' - where next for rugby's civil war?,,"""I think the battle lines have been drawn publicly and everyone knows where the unions stand,"" says sports lawyer Ben Cisneros of Morgan Sports Law. ""The main thing everybody is seeking is a clearer understanding about what the competition looks like and what the future holds. ""If players are going to be entering into new contracts with clubs within this new entity, there are going to need to be a number of assurances that they'll want to have about the viability of the competition, whether indeed it is going to happen, the opportunity to play and be paid and of course to have assurances around matters such as player welfare issues around anti-doping etc. ""I think all parties are right to be raising those questions, including the unions. They've identified that there is a lack of detail out there."" A ban on players representing their country and playing for R360 is one clear detail, but, could that be challenged? ""What the European courts have said is that if you're going to have rules about whether new competitions are going to be sanctioned and whether players can participate in them while remaining part of the eco-system, they have to be clear, objective, transparent, proportionate, and non-discriminatory,"" said Cisneros. ""That's something the lawyers will be scrutinising and whether any potential competition law issue could be justified is another thorny question. ""Recent judgements have suggested a tightening up and applying a more orthodox approach to sport from a competition law perspective. ""So if the rules or the lack of rules is found to be an issue from a competition law perspective then it might be quite difficult for the governing bodies to justify bans. ""It wouldn't be beyond the realms of possibility that rugby might be headed for legal action."" A comment below Mitchell's LinkedIn post suggested the same.

2b57d213939c,How Broncos and 'play-dough' quarterback can end Chiefs' reign,,"New tight end Evan Engram has stepped up big and new running back JK Dobbins is a guy they believe in. He's currently fifth in the NFL for rushing yards (402) and tied-fourth for rushing touchdowns (four). I love that head coach Sean Payton has ""RUN IT!"" at the top of his playcall sheet. , external That shows how the Broncos are a team that wants to run first, because you can do a lot off the back of that. It slows down the pass rush and keeps you in favourable down and distances. It's also helped quarterback Bo Nix, who came into the league as the 12th overall draft pick last year, throwing 29 touchdown passes â second only to Justin Herbert for the rookie record (31 in 2020). Josh Allen and Herbert have the arm strength to throw anywhere, but they don't move in the same way as Nix. He has incredible arm talent, which is different, and he is so athletic. His strengths are his mobility, being able to throw on the run, and finding different arm angles to make the pass when he rolls out of the pocket, the bootlegs. He can throw that layered pass across the middle or over the corner. For a young quarterback, at 25, he's got a lot of poise in the pocket and isn't really fazed by the blitz. He tries to avoid a sack as much as possible and is able to throw under pressure. He has a high football IQ and is very decisive. When you constantly run the ball it eats up the clock and forces the defence to be on the field for longer, and when you've got an athletic quarterback the defence has to cover the field vertically and horizontally. It can be exhausting. Nix has bitten back at Payton on the sideline sometimes and I think the coach likes that attitude, that he's such a competitor. I think it's fun for him to have a young quarterback who's kind of like play-dough. He can really build something up the way he wants to build it. I think it's a special experience for him. Payton has won a Super Bowl and now passed Bill Parcells for career NFL wins (173 - tied 14th overall). He's seen it all. I think the success Denver are having on offence is mostly down to his leadership, his play-calling, his situational awareness â and the combination with Nix helps make him what he is. You wouldn't want a better guy in your ear, to help you through some of the tougher situations and build confidence. I believe in Denver's defence, in Bo Nix's tenacity and composure. But are they good enough to go against an elite team at its best? Because that was not a Super Bowl performance by the Eagles last Sunday. Right now, I don't think the Broncos are incredible. They're working above average, which is a good place to be in their division. All they need to do is maintain this trajectory. They're really good at leaning into their strength, which is running the ball, and that's exactly what they should do against the New York Jets at Tottenham. It's going to be the JK Dobbins show, essentially. The Jets have allowed 140 rushing yards per game (sixth worst in the league), five rushing touchdowns this season (10th worst), and they're the only team yet to win a game. Since the NFL began tracking turnovers in 1933, the Jets are also the first team to be without a single takeaway through five games, which is kind of shocking when you think that their new coach Aaron Glenn was defensive co-ordinator at the Detroit Lions.",https://www.bbc.com/sport/american-football/articles/cwyr4ggqlxgo,Sports,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/branded_sport/1200/cpsprodpb/2ea4/live/1b412920-e470-11ef-a319-fb4e7360c4ec.png,2025-10-09T08:07:39.845000+00:00,d9d9cd2981177d481238fd9da66ca84419a34dba

The 27 year old announced the news on Saturday in an Instagram post - along with pictures of her son, Rudy, and a sign saying ""we adore you"". The Oasis frontman, 53, met his daughter for the first time in 2018 . She was raised by her mother, the singer Lisa Moorish. He has three other children - two sons from his marriages to actress Patsy Kensit and singer Nicole Appleton, and another daughter from his relationship with US journalist Liza Ghorbani. In the post, Moorish-Gallagher added a caption which said ""In a message to you, Rudy"", accompanied by a blue heart emoji. Other photos in her post included a ""hello baby"" sign hanging on a kitchen door, and a picture of Moorish-Gallagher holding her son's hand. In a third photo, Rudy is seen wearing an orange jumper with the letter ""R"" on the back, as Moorish-Gallagher's footballer boyfriend Nathaniel Phillips cuddles their son. Phillips, who began his career at Liverpool, plays for West Bromwich Albion. Getty Images Moorish-Gallagher confirmed she was dating Phillips in 2022 Fans and celebrities were quick to comment on her post, with the model Daisy Lowe writing: ""Biggest congratulations sweetheart."" Moorish-Gallagher first revealed she was pregnant in May, posting a photo on Instagram with Phillips as she held her baby bump. In 2017, before the reconciliation with his daughter, Gallagher admitted he had ""never got around"" to meeting her, saying he ""didn't get on"" with her mother. The following year, he revealed they had met by posting a photo of them standing together. They were joined by his sons Lennon and Gene. It is not known whether Gallagher has met his grandson. Earlier this year, Oasis embarked on a series of sold-out gigs following the band's dramatic split in 2009 after a backstage bust-up between Gallagher and his brother Noel.

7791bb4965da,"Murder, betrayal and lies - why we're attracted to The Traitors' dark side",,"Murder, betrayal and lies - why we're attracted to The Traitors' dark side Paul Glynn Culture reporter BBC Spoiler warning: This article reveals details from The Celebrity Traitors The Traitors, at its heart, is a game of lying and deception. The celebrity edition of the hit BBC show began this week, and with it a murdering spree. For the first, it was Alan Carr in the kitchen with the poisoned lily. Just as in the regular series, we find a bunch of people attempting to find out who is lying and who is telling the truth, while faced with the enormous uncertainty of being ""killed"" off. On this occasion, the victim was singer Paloma Faith. She was unimpressed to be bumped off by Carr, who is her friend - or so she thought. So why have so many viewers taken the show to their hearts, and what does it say about our human nature? For Richard Wiseman, professor of the public understanding of psychology at the University of Hertfordshire, such treachery ""feels a bit like everyday life"". ""You're trying to figure out which of your friends and partners and colleagues may not be entirely straight with you,"" he tells BBC News. Deception, he says, ""is in our DNA"" as something we do from around the age of three. ""As soon as children master language, they start lying,"" adds Prof Wiseman. ""If we were radically honest with one another all the time, then we'd probably break apart as a society fairly rapidly. So on one level, deception holds us together."" The problem, he adds, is that it can also be used in an ""exploitative way"", as anyone who tuned in this week to find current Celebrity Traitors Alan Carr, Cat Burns and Jonathan Ross scheming so splendlidly will testify. ""It absolutely fascinates us... you've got that microcosm, you can see all of that being played out in a rather fun way."" The hardest thing with lie detecting is knowing how people behave normally, according to Prof Wiseman, who has written about the psychology of magic and illusion, deception, luck and self-development. ""What we're quite good at is, when it's friends and partners, we know their truthful behaviour,"" he says. ""And you're looking for people departing from that."" For example, when TV presenter Kate Garraway stood accused of being a potential traitor for her excessively theatrical reactions, she defended herself by explaining she was always ""a ham"". ""Now, you have to know her to know how she behaves normally to know whether this is deceptive or not."" Prof Wiseman thinks the faithful stars are going wrong by so far basing their assumptions on what people do and say, when ""the best signals are what people don't say and don't do"". ""Liars tend to be pretty quiet,"" he says, noting the difficulties of that with ""a bunch of celebrities"" who will be ""used to being centre of attention"". Singer Burns, one of the traitors, told viewers she planned to ""lay low"" and go ""under the radar"", and it seems to be working so far. Good liars also tend to be intelligent, Wiseman says, citing salespeople, politicians and - ahem - performers among those who will be ""pretty high self-monitors"". ""Alan Carr and Jonathan Ross are very used to interviewing people,"" he says. ""And used to interviewees who will be somewhat elusive."" Host Claudia Winkleman oversaw the celebrities as they dug their own graves in episode one So do actors and performers like those on this show make better liars than previous contestants? Not according to one of the current faithful, actor and presenter Stephen Fry, who told the Radio Times : ""Actors are terrible liars! It's not an actor's job to lie. It's an actor's job to tell the truth."" But was he telling the truth or lying? Jake Brown, joint winner from series three, told BBC Breakfast he thinks professional performers ""know how to deceive, they know how to be someone else"". Series three finalist Alexander Dragonetti tells BBC News that anyone hoping to rely on their acting skills to win will have to be ""incredibly consistent"" and do it ""perfectly day after day"". ""If anyone sees even a small chink in your armour, they'll think you're playing a game and they'll get rid of you,"" he says. ""So if you do act, this is going to be the test of your life. You're going to have to do it perfectly day after day. ""And the days are long, the pressure is huge, and holding up that kind of act for any period I think is going to be incredibly hard."" 'The illusion of co-operation' On the latest episode, beloved veteran actress Celia Imrie was seen telling her fellow participants: ""People think I'm nice, but I'm not."" For clinical and forensic psychologist Dr Susan Young, the celebrity edition of the show adds an extra level of deception and intrigue due to the professional ""impression management"" of pre-existing personas. Viewers ""project pre-existing beliefs"" on to the stars because ""these are people who we feel we know"", she tells us. But in reality we ""can't tell where the performance ends and where it begins"". As ""voyeurs of morality"", she adds, ""we can't wait for the nice person to do something unexpectedly"". The group dynamic is what interests Dr Young most because what lies beneath is an inherent ""double bind"". ""Everyone must lie"", she says, because ""to be honest is dangerous""; and yet ""lying corrodes the team"", which is much-needed to complete tasks. ""What the show does here, it exposes the illusion of co-operation and that's in so many systems. It's in our workplaces, it's in politics, it's in friendships under stress,"" she says. ""At the end of the day, given certain circumstances and under certain pressures, altruism will thin and self-interest surfaces."" She adds: ""It's almost like a social experiment, it's mirroring how quickly loyalty will collapse when incentives change."" Caroline Frost, TV editor of the Radio Times, reckons The Celebrity Traitors is on course to be ""one of the biggest shows of the year"". Two years ago, she recalls, she attended an industry seminar where producers said they had resisted the urge to include celebrities in the original show because they thought it was more interesting to select people who did not have public reputations to keep intact. But that was then, and this is now. The great paradox of a new celebrity version, she smiles, is that none of their careers and reputations ""count for anything come nightfall"". ""The further they get into the game, the more of the celebrity trappings get left behind and the less important their fame becomes, which means it really doesn't matter that they're celebrities at all."" Frost thinks it was an ""incredibly ingenious decision"" to make Carr a traitor ""because he's giggly and extrovert and doesn't seem to be able to ever filter what he says or keep a secret"". ""Making him a traitor has really upped the stakes."" She feels Carr's repuatation as a bubbly, chatty man has been ""weaponised"" to enable him to get away with murdering his mate in plain sight. He did seem a bit cut up about it afterwards, mind you, when he met up again with his fellow traitors. But as Ross reminded him: ""You're not a bad person. You're a good traitor.""

25a17ebaba39,New James Bond producer up for the ‘challenge',,"New James Bond producer up for the ‘challenge' Lizo Mzimba Entertainment Correspondent, London Film Festival Getty Images David Heyman is co-producing the next Bond film One of the producers of the next James Bond film says he is ""very excited to embrace the challenge"" of taking the franchise forward following its sale to Amazon MGM. David Heyman spoke briefly about how the film was progressing under its new owners while on the red carpet at the London Film Festival with 007 co-producer Amy Pascal at the UK premiere of their latest movie Jay Kelly. ""It's going to be a lot of fun, and I think we're going to make something very special,"" Heyman told the BBC. Bond producers Barbara Broccoli and Michael G. Wilson agreed earlier this year to sell creative control to Amazon - reportedly for $1bn (£760m). Peaky Blinders creator Steven Knight will write the forthcoming film, which will be directed by Dune's Denis Villeneuve. However, the new James Bond actor is yet to be confirmed. Heyman said: ""It's early days. I think we have a magnificent director, a wonderful writer. And it's great to be working with Amy Pascal as a partner on this odyssey."" He added: ""It's a tall order. Barbara Broccoli and Michael G Wilson did such a remarkable job over the years."" Heyman is best known for producing all eight Harry Potter movies, as well as the three Paddington films. Amy Pascal produced the three Tom Holland Spider-Man movies, as well as the animated Spider-Man: Into the Spider-verse and its sequel Across the Spider-verse. The new film he made with Pascal was screened at the Royal Festival Hall. Jay Kelly stars George Clooney as the title character - a movie star in his 60s looking back at his life and career, and re-examining how the choices he made have affected his family. Heyman previously worked with Clooney on the Oscar winning sci-fi drama Gravity. ""He's just a wonderful actor, this part is particularly brave. He's going to very uncomfortable places, exposing some really vulnerability. Because the film is also very much about the facades we put on in our lives."" 'Looking forward' EPA/Shutterstock George Clooney on the Jay Kelly red carpet with his wife Amal Clooney The Oscar winning actor was also on red carpet, and explained that while he's a similar age to his character, he feels he hasn't made the same misjudgements. ""It's about sacrifices we all make,"" Clooney says. ""The character I play, he's got a lot of regret. And I don't really have quite that much regret, I've had a fairly full life. I have great friends and great family. So I feel very lucky to have pursued my career in the way that I have."" In the film, Jay Kelly is looking back on his career, but Clooney says he is still looking forward, with things progressing on what will be his fourth film in the Ocean's 11 series, Ocean's 14. ""We got our budget approved, so now we've just got to find a date when everybody's available which Is a little bit of a trick. But we're getting to work on it.""

Speaking at the Cliveden Literary Festival in Berkshire, Queen Camilla affectionately recalled an anecdote about Dame Jilly. ""She came to a party here a few years ago where, I hope, she uttered her immortal line, 'I'm going to get so absolutely plastered tonight, darling. I love you so much, I want to see two of you',"" she said, to laughter in the room. ""Dear Jilly, how we'd love to have seen just one of you here with us today."" The Queen also revealed that the Vesper Martini, which was invented by author Ian Fleming as James Bond's drink of choice, was a favourite tipple of the ""much missed"" Dame Jilly. At the event, Queen Camilla met the festival's founders and panellists. She then officially opened the festival, delivering a speech before a panel discussion on the importance of reading and studying literature. Queen Camilla then hosted a reception in the French Dining Room, with attendees including Sir Salman Rushdie and Sir Ian Rankin. Earlier in the week, Queen Camilla led the tributes to Dame Jilly, who died after a fall. In a statement, she said she hoped her hereafter would be filled ""with impossibly handsome men and devoted dogs"". Since Dame Jilly's death, there has been an outpouring of love for her. Many of the themes that dominated her so-called bonkbusters - sex, affection and horses - have been central to those tributes. At the festival, others shared their love and affection for Dame Jilly. Speaking to reporters, Sir Ian said he had read her novel Rivals and ""loved it"". He said he had met her multiple times, and that they had kept in touch.

29b9dc5b6b21,Wolf Alice: 'A good album is one of the highest forms of art',,"Wolf Alice: 'A good album is one of the highest forms of art' Mark Savage Music Correspondent BBC Wolf Alice at the BBC in August 2025 (left-right): Joff Oddie, Theo Ellis, Joel Amey and Ellie Rowsell Wolf Alice are in a class of their own when it comes to the Mercury Prize. Last month, they received their fourth consecutive nomination for the coveted music award thanks to their new album, The Clearing. That's something no-one else has ever achieved. Not Arctic Monkeys, not Radiohead, not Pulp. What's more, they've done it with their first four albums. ""For some reason, it makes me feel really anxious,"" admits singer Ellie Rowsell, speaking to the BBC from Nashville, where the band are in final rehearsals for their world tour. She's speaking from experience. When Wolf Alice won the Mercury Prize for their second album, Visions of a Life, in 2018, Ellie struggled to gain her composure at the podium. ""I'm so nervous,"" she exclaimed, her hands shaking, before bandmate Theo Ellis stepped in to finish the speech. To fans, Rowsell's jitters might have seemed strange. On stage, the singer is normally a fireball of intensity, screaming punky anthems like Yuk Foo and commanding the spotlight with magnetic charisma. But their more intimate songs portray her as an habitual outsider who doubts her own abilities and motivations. On Thorns, the pensive opening song of The Clearing, she even berates herself for ""making a song and dance"" about the break-up that inspired Wolf Alice's previous album, Blue Weekend. ""I don't know if I'm shy. I think I'm socially inept,"" she recently told Canadian DJ Tara Sloane . ""I'm very confident in some things, but I'm not the loudest person in the room."" The band won the Mercury Prize in 2018, beating other shortlisted artists including Arctic Monkeys, Noel Gallagher and Lily Allen Her nerves about attending another awards show is understandable, then. But Rowsell is also ""grateful and happy"" to be included on the Mercury shortlist again. They will find out if they have won when the ceremony takes place on Thursday. ""We take albums pretty seriously,"" says guitarist Joff Oddie, speaking from his home in London (he's sitting out the US tour because his partner is about to give birth to their first child). ""In our world, a good album is one of the highest forms of art. People can do good songs, or a great live performance, and those are all great signposts. But, for me, a really great album is an incredible feat... if you can pull it off."" That's why the band have signed up as ambassadors for National Album Day, which takes place on Saturday, 18 October, with special events around the UK and limited edition vinyl re-releases of classic records by Liam Gallagher, Patti Smith and Iggy Pop. Asked to name their favourite albums, however, and Wolf Alice are evasive. ""I don't know what my absolute top three would be,"" says Rowsell. ""But if I can re-listen to an album top to bottom over and over again, that's a telltale sign - because it's hard to keep your attention."" PA Media The band's third album, 2021's Blue Weekend, saw them rise to festival headliner status The singer - who reveals Pink's Missundaztood was the first album she owned - eventually settles on The Streets' A Grand Don't Come For Free as an example of ""a perfect album"". ""I feel like it's one of those albums where, even if it's not to your taste, you can actually appreciate the artistry,"" she says. ""I'm not really that into concept albums, but it's got an amazing story from beginning to end - and it never compromises the songs,"" agrees Oddie. The guitarist also chooses Brian Eno's ambient classic Music For Airports as one of his Desert Island Albums. ""I've spent most of my adult life in transit, and it's a beautiful record for zoning out the outside world,"" he says. Shape shifters They collectively agree that 1966's The Velvet Underground & Nico is a must-have for any serious music fan. ""It's one of the most important alternative records of all time,"" says Oddie. ""It's got incredible songwriting, the songs stand up on their own, but they're cloaked in really avant-garde sounds and techniques. ""As a guitarist in an indie band, if you can write incredible songs and play them interestingly, then you're part of that lineage."" The variety of their tastes - Rowsell also selects the mutant folk of Lankum's 2023 album False Lankum - is the key to Wolf Alice's shape-shifting sound. Getty Images After forming as folk duo in 2010, Wolf Alice became one of the UK's biggest indie bands They started out as a folk duo in 2010 but quickly expanded to a quartet, adopting an alt-rock style characterised by Oddie's textured guitar work, the rhythmic interplay between bassist Ellis and drummer Joel Amey, and Rowsell's cutting lyricism. In the early stages, Oddie says, they were ""just muddling through"". ""We had no idea, from a technical perspective, of what we were doing. ""We worked with some brilliant people that were, in hindsight, very, very patient with us. ""It was probably a nightmare to make a record [with us] at that time because we had an idea of what we wanted to sound like, but we didn't know how things worked."" Each album marked a progression. Their 2015 debut My Love Is Cool wrapped ethereal indie anthems in barbed-wire guitar riffs; 2017's Visions Of A Life produced their biggest hit, the delirious synth-driven Don't Delete The Kisses , as well as winning the Mercury; and 2021's Blue Weekend added a sweeping, bruised grandeur to their sound. The Clearing, which topped the UK album chart in August, marks their boldest evolution yet - embracing the nostalgic sounds of 1970s FM pop radio, earning comparisons to The Carpenters, Fleetwood Mac and Steely Dan. Rachel Fleminger Hudson / RCA Records Wolf Alice are embracing the iconography of 1970s rock bands on their new album ""Maybe in hindsight it was a bit of a stylistic turn,"" says Rowsell. ""But it didn't feel too drastic at the time. It just reflected what we were listening to."" Their goal was to make a record that felt good to play live, full of what Oddie calls ""more song-y songs"" like the Blue Weekend track Delicious Things – which has become an unexpected highlight of their live shows. ""That song was a departure from what we'd done before [and] it didn't feel like it was one people would enjoy live,"" says Rowsell. ""But the audience were just as upbeat and excited as when we play one of our rock songs. ""So I was like, 'OK, it's not just fast, loud, heavy music that gets a crowd going'. And that was really exciting."" ""It's a confidence thing,"" adds Oddie. ""Sometimes you feel like you have to make yourself heard by being as loud and abrasive as you can be. ""We were going, 'Oh, we can connect with the audience in a way that's just as impactful, but different'."" The band are currently in the middle of a world tour that hits the UK in November Recorded in Los Angeles with A-list producer Greg Kurstin (Adele, Beyoncé, Foo Fighters), the album is unapologetically big; brimming with harmonies and hooks and ambition and heart. But the soft rock reinvention caught some critics off guard. While reviews were largely positive, The Quietus recoiled at the lack of heavy guitar anthems in a scathing screed that employed descriptors like ""unintrusive"", ""clunking"" and ""by-numbers detritus"". ""Wolf Alice had the juice. On The Clearing, that juice has abandoned them,"" agreed Soundsphere's Callie Petch . Admittedly, it takes a minute to adjust - but The Clearing is one of those records that reveals new depths and complexity with every listen. The songs might not have the tinnitus-inducing qualities of old favourites like Fluffy or Play The Greatest Hits, but there's a newfound confidence and playfulness amid the calm. That's why, on the album's artwork, Wolf Alice lean into the iconography of 70s rock. Ellis poses in a leather jacket studded with the words Wolf Alice. Rowsell stands in a spotlight, head thrust back as she sings with eyes-screwed-shut intensity. RCA Records The artwork marks the first time the band have taken full portraits for one of their album covers ""On our first two albums, the artwork was just found images,"" says Rowsell. ""And if you can stumble across a photo that represents the music and the lyrics, it's really romantic and amazing."" For this record, however, Wolf Alice called in photographer Rachel Fleminger Hudson – who spent six months trawling through ""thousands and thousands"" of archive images and interviews to create an aesthetic that reflected the band's inspirations and ambitions. ""She was very academic in how she approached it,"" says Oddie. ""There was a lot of leather. A lot."" It all adds up to a declaration of intent. A criticism/compliment that's often been levelled at Wolf Alice is that they're impossible to pin down. Their influences are too broad. Their ideas are too disparate. But The Clearing has a clarity and purpose that suggests they're finally OK with the idea of being a chart-topping, festival-headlining ""big band"". ""Oh, I don't know if we're owning being a big band,"" Oddie demurs. ""I don't think we'd say that. But we are owning being a band, full stop. ""We're leaning into the lore.""",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/crmey4pw9vpo,Entertainment,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/64d5/live/1dc95f80-a42f-11f0-92db-77261a15b9d2.png,2025-10-11T02:34:52.195000+00:00,ef42341c8363d65e81157d1fd362066549d74ad8
d6cd6bc34004,MTV to axe its music TV channels in the UK,,"MTV to axe its music TV channels in the UK Mark Savage Music Correspondent Getty Images MTV Europe launched in 1987, with the UK getting a dedicated channel in 1997 MTV, the world's first 24-hour music broadcaster, is to stop showing rolling pop videos in the UK after almost 40 years when it closes five channels at the end of the year. MTV Music, MTV 80s, MTV 90s, Club MTV and MTV Live will all stop broadcasting after 31 December, the BBC understands. However, the flagship channel, MTV HD, will remain on air, showing reality series including Naked Dating UK and Geordie Shore. The move reflects a shift in viewing habits, with music videos largely consumed on YouTube and social media rather than television. A spokesman for MTV's parent company, Paramount, declined to comment. 'Breaks my heart' Former MTV VJ Simone Angel told BBC News she was ""really sad, and I'm a little bit in disbelief, and I know it's been a long time coming"". ""We need to support these artists and we all need to dance again and listen to music,"" she said. ""And I know we do that online in our own little bubbles, but MTV was the place where everything came together. So it really does break my heart."" MTV launched in the US in 1981 and the fledgling TV channel quickly captured the public imagination by showing pop videos ""on demand"", presented by enthusiastic ""VJs"" (video jockeys), who became almost as famous as the stars they introduced. Groundbreaking moments in its early years included the world premiere of Michael Jackson's Thriller video, a 16-hour broadcast of the Live Aid concerts in 1985, and the birth of the MTV Video Music Awards. A European offshoot launched in 1987 and the UK got its own dedicated channel in 1997 - launching with the video for David Baddiel and Frank Skinner's football anthem Three Lions. Getty Images Katy Perry hosted the MTV Europe Music Awards three times, in 2008, 2010 and 2013 The channel gave early breaks to presenters including Cat Deeley, Zane Lowe, and Emma Willis, and later branched out into original programming with series like Ex On The Beach and Teen Mom UK. Angel, who worked for both MTV Europe and MTV UK in the 1990s, said it was a ""wild"" time. ""It was like being on a school trip without any teachers. We had so much fun,"" she said. ""MTV Europe was really the forerunner to the internet. We were the most widespread TV channel in the world at that point. We had between 100 and 150 million viewers."" 'Shouldn't just be reality TV' She recounted a story that former Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev once told the boss of MTV that the channel had an influence on young people in the Communist countries behind the Iron Curtain in the 80s. ""He said, 'Music achieved more than missiles', because MTV Europe was the first channel that showed what Western life was like. It went past all the propaganda and we showed youth culture, and people wanted that. It was incredibly important."" There is still a place for music on TV, Angel believes. ""You've just got to move with the times. To this day, it's one of the most recognisable brands in the world. Why on earth throw that away? It's not thrown away, but it's just reality TV. That's not what MTV is or should be."" Getty Images Justin Timberlake pictured at the MTV Europe Music Awards 2006 in Copenhagen In 2011, the main MTV UK channel abandoned music videos altogether, pushing all music programming to its sister stations, with the exception of the annual MTV European Music Awards. That ceremony - which was the scene of memorable moments including The Spice Girls' final appearance before splitting up in 2000, and Rita Ora's tearful tribute to Liam Payne last year - is currently on pause. Paramount put the event on ice earlier this year as it pursued a merger with entertainment company Skydance Media. The deal was approved in July , but no decision has been made about the future of the EMAs. Wider layoffs Paramount is also expected to close MTV music channels in countries including Australia, Poland, France and Brazil, according to media reports in those countries. The closures come as the company seeks to cut costs by as much as $500m (£376m) across its global portfolio. In August, it closed Paramount Television Studios, which produced series including action thriller Jack Ryan and children's adventure series The Spiderwick Chronicles. The layoffs also affected MTV productions in the UK, where original shows Gonzo and Fresh Out UK were cancelled. According to the latest ratings from Barb, MTV's music channels continued to attract modest audiences in the UK. MTV music had 1.3 million viewers in July, with MTV 90s attracting 949,000. The brand will also continue to have a presence on social media and Paramount's streaming service Paramount+.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cdr612yz8p0o,Entertainment,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/f529/live/5eea1410-a5c3-11f0-add7-abf13599c13e.jpg,2025-10-10T16:06:47.758000+00:00,b3b2cafe6121e1bac61b795ad1504e0a4580bb36
82ab954436fc,Gregg Wallace claims BBC caused him 'distress and harassment',,"Gregg Wallace claims BBC caused him 'distress and harassment' Noor Nanji Culture reporter BBC/ShineTV Former MasterChef presenter Gregg Wallace is seeking up to £10,000 in damages from the BBC, claiming the broadcaster caused him ""distress and harassment"" by failing to comply with his request for copies of his personal data, according to court documents. Wallace is taking legal action against the BBC and BBC Studios after being sacked from the cooking show in July. His dismissal followed a report that upheld more than 40 allegations about his conduct on MasterChef, including one of unwelcome physical contact and three of being in a state of undress. Wallace previously said he was ""deeply sorry for any distress"" he caused and that he ""never set out to harm or humiliate"". The BBC and BBC Studios say they won't be commenting on ongoing legal proceedings. They have filed a defence to the claim, but the details are not yet available. BBC News is editorially independent from the wider corporation. In documents filed at the High Court, Wallace claimed that, in March, he requested ""personal data"" from both the BBC and its subsidiary, BBC Studios, under data protection laws. Both requests for data related to his ""work, contractual relations and conduct"" spanning 21 years. In the court documents, Wallace claimed the BBC considered his request to be ""complex"" and as such requested an extension to the usual one-month deadline to provide such information. In August, the documents said, the BBC emailed Wallace to apologise for the delay and said they were ""taking all reasonable steps"" to process the request in ""a timely manner"", but he still has not received a response. The documents further claimed that BBC Studios told Wallace it was withholding parts of his data on the basis of ""freedom of expression"". But Wallace claimed it had ""unlawfully failed to supply all of the claimant's personal data"" and had ""wrongly redacted"" information. ""By reason of the defendants failing to fully comply with the [subject access request] made by the claimant for his own personal data, the defendants acted in breach of their statutory duty and in doing so caused distress and harassment to the claimant,"" he said. He stated he was seeking damages for ""distress, harassment and loss of amenity not exceeding £10,000"" as well as interest. Wallace is also seeking a court order that the BBC and BBC Studios comply with the requests for his data. Wallace's representatives have been approached for a comment. BBC/Shine TV Wallace had hosted MasterChef for 20 years, but stepped away from presenting the show last year after facing a string of misconduct claims. The show's production company Banijay ordered an immediate inquiry into the allegations, which was conducted by an independent law firm. This summer, the law firm’s report revealed that 45 claims against Wallace had been substantiated. In total, the report said 83 allegations were made against the TV presenter, with the majority of the upheld claims relating to inappropriate sexual language and humour, but also culturally insensitive or racist comments. Following that report, Wallace issued a statement to the PA news agency, saying that ""none of the serious allegations against me were upheld"". A separate claim that his co-host John Torode had used a severely offensive racist term was also substantiated. Torode has said he has ""no recollection"" of the incident. Both presenters were sacked in July. Last month, it was revealed that food critic Grace Dent and chef Anna Haugh are the new hosts of MasterChef.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cg7dlem0vdno,Entertainment,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/0662/live/570e42c0-a5c8-11f0-928c-71dbb8619e94.jpg,2025-10-10T17:33:51.471000+00:00,a95269c55d4636de31029d5194069aaee4bb57e7

The ER and Doctor Who star, who is currently competing on Strictly Come Dancing, told the Independent she had a hysterectomy and radiation therapy during her treatment, which finished late last year. ""I had assumed that the way I was feeling was old age, and I just sort of accepted it,"" Kingston, 62, said. ""I thought, 'OK, this is what it's like to be in my sixties.' But a lot of how I was feeling was to do with my illness."" Getty Images Kingston is known for playing River Song in Doctor Who and Dr Elizabeth Corday in ER Kingston said she had been experiencing bloating and aches for some time, but only sought medical help after spotting blood in her urine. ""I never went down the cancer road in my head,"" she said. ""It was a shock, because I have a very positive outlook on life in general. ""Even though my body was telling me there was something very seriously wrong, I kept thinking, 'Oh, I've got a bad UTI or fibroids.'"" She explained that her 2024 was dominated by the diagnosis and subsequent treatment. ""I had a major operation,"" she told the newspaper. ""I had to have a hysterectomy, I had to go into radiation therapy, and that took up a huge part of my life."" The actress recalled that she had suffered a haemorrhage while on stage at Chichester Festival Theatre, something she described as ""shocking"". She appeared in The Other Boleyn Girl at the West Sussex theatre in April and May 2024. After seeking medical attention following the show's run, Kingston was told the cancer was in her fallopian tubes but had not spread to the ovaries. ""The minute I had the operation, I suddenly felt like myself again,"" Kingston said. The actress urged other women not to ignore any signs of ill health, and to have check-ups if they feel anything is wrong. Kingston played River Song in BBC One sci-fi series Doctor Who from 2008 to 2015, and starred in US medical drama ER for more than a decade as Dr Elizabeth Corday. She is currently taking part in Strictly with professional dance partner Johannes Radebe, and the pair topped the leaderboard last week with their samba. The actress said it was her experience last year that inspired her to say yes to the dancing show, because ""life is too short"" not to take opportunities you want.

c7956cbbc702,Drake's lawsuit over Kendrick Lamar diss track is dismissed,,"Drake's lawsuit over Kendrick Lamar diss track is dismissed Nardine Saad Los Angeles and Mark Savage Music correspondent Getty Images A judge has dismissed Drake's defamation lawsuit against Universal Music Group over Kendrick Lamar's Not Like Us. Judge Jeannette Vargas ruled Lamar's lyrics, which accused Drake and his associates of being ""certified paedophiles"", were ""nonactionable opinion"" and could not be considered defamatory. Drake filed the lawsuit in January accusing Universal Music Group (UMG), the record label behind both rappers, of defamation by allowing the song to be published and promoted, saying it spread a ""false and malicious narrative"". Drake's spokesperson said he will appeal against the ruling. UMG said it was pleased with the outcome and was looking forward to continuing its work with the Canadian star. War of words Not Like Us, which was released in May 2024, was widely seen as the decisive blow in an ongoing battle between the rival rappers. It has become the biggest hit of Lamar's career, having won five Grammys and being one of the most-talked about moments of his Super Bowl half-time show in February. In a 38-page order, Judge Vargas called the row between the rappers ""the most infamous rap battle in the genre's history"". ""The artists' seven-track rap battle was a 'war of words' that was the subject of substantial media scrutiny and online discourse,"" the judge wrote. Getty Images Kendrick Lamar performed Not Like Us during the 2025 Super Bowl half-time show in New Orleans, Louisiana. ""Although the accusation that plaintiff is a pedophile is certainly a serious one, the broader context of a heated rap battle, with incendiary language and offensive accusations hurled by both participants, would not incline the reasonable listener to believe that 'Not Like Us' imparts verifiable facts about plaintiff."" She also noted that, in an earlier song, Drake had ""challenged Lamar to make the paedophilia accusations"" that featured in Not Like Us. On the track Taylor Made Freestyle, Drake used the AI-generated voice of Tupac Shakur to give Lamar advice on how to win the rap battle. ""Talk about him likin' young girls, that's a gift from me,"" the song suggested. ""It is in this context in which such lyrics as 'Say, Drake, I hear you like 'em young'   must be assessed,"" wrote Judge Vargas. ""The similarity in the wording suggests strongly that this line is a direct callback to Drake's lyrics in the prior song."" 'An affront to artists' Drake, whose real name is Aubrey Graham, did not name Lamar in the lawsuit. His lawyers accused UMG of launching ""a campaign to create a viral hit"" out of a song that made the ""false factual allegation that Drake is a criminal paedophile, and to suggest that the public should resort to vigilante justice in response"". Ruling against Drake, Judge Vargas said listeners would not expect ""accurate factual reporting"" from a diss track ""replete with profanity, trash-talking, threats of violence, and figurative and hyperbolic language."" She pointed out that Drake himself had engaged in similar language, quoting a lyric in which the star ""heavily"" implied that ""Lamar is a domestic abuser"", and another where Drake ""raps that he 'heard' that one of Lamar's sons may not be biologically his."" Regarding Lamar's song, Judge Vargas said: ""Even apparent statements of fact may assume the character of statements of opinion... when made in public debate, heated labour dispute, or other circumstances in which an audience may anticipate the use of epithets, fiery rhetoric or hyperbole."" Responding to the dismissal, a UMG spokesperson said: ""From the outset, this lawsuit was an affront to all artists and their creative expression and never should have seen the light of day"". ""We're pleased with the court's dismissal and look forward to continuing our work successfully promoting Drake's music and investing in his career,"" the spokesperson added. A spokesperson for Drake said the musician intended to appeal the ruling, ""and we look forward to the Court of Appeals reviewing it"".

The bass player and ""massive-hearted man"" joined the band in 1966 with fellow singer Justin Hayward, following the departure of Denny Laine and Clint Warwick. Birmingham-born Lodge played on songs such as Nights In White Satin, Question and Isn't Life Strange. The family said their ""darling husband"", father, grandfather, father-in-law and brother ""peacefully slipped away surrounded by his loved ones and the sounds of The Everly Brothers and Buddy Holly"". Lodge featured on some of The Moody Blues' best-known work including the psychedelic album Days Of Future Passed (1967), and its follow-up, In Search Of The Lost Chord (1968), which saw the band move towards further experimentation. He also featured on the albums On The Threshold Of A Dream, To Our Children's Children's Children, A Question Of Balance, Every Good Boy Deserves Favour and Seventh Sojourn, which saw the band move into full scale progressive rock. Lodge also featured on 1977's Octave album, which saw the group embrace a more pop-oriented sound and continued to make records with the band until their final studio album December, a collection of Christmas songs released in 2003. Chris Walter/Getty Images Band members Mike Pinder, John Lodge, Graeme Edge, Ray Thomas and Justin Hayward were pictured in 1969 The family said it was ""with the deepest sadness"" that they had to announce the musician had been ""suddenly and unexpectedly taken from us"". ""As anyone who knew this massive-hearted man knows, it was his enduring love of his wife, Kirsten, and his family, that was the most important thing to him, followed by his passion for music, and his faith."" Lodge spoke on a number of occasions about being an Evangelical Christian, saying it helped him to avoid the excesses of rock and roll. In their statement, the family said: ""We will forever miss his love, smile, kindness, and his absolute and never-ending support. ""We are heartbroken, but will walk forwards into peace surrounded by the love he had for each of us. ""As John would always say at the end of the show, thank you for keeping the faith.""

The family said he was ""never happier than being on stage"" and ""adored performing with his band and son-in-law, Jon, and being able to continue sharing this music with his fans"". It gave him ""even more joy to be able to work with his daughter Emily and son Kristian"", they added.

The TV presenter is suspect #1 for the Olympic diver, who made zero efforts to hide it during Thursday night's show. At one point, Garraway declares she is ""flabbergasted"" by the first murder. Daley, 31, has no time for it, giving a major eye roll. ""Who uses that word?"" he asks. ""You can't just call someone a Traitor because they have a better vocabulary than you,"" replies comedian Alan Carr, 49. But Daley's not the only one who thinks Garraway could be a Traitor. Throughout the episode, Garraway was accused both by her fellow contestants and by fans online of ""over-acting"". ""Kate Garraway is coming across so suspicious and being so over the top. Even I'm starting to think she's secretly a Traitor and I know she isn't,"" wrote one X user . For entertainment reporter Indigo Stafford, the behaviour seemed to suggest Garraway, 58, was hiding something. Spoiler: she was not. She's a faithful. But when her name was repeatedly brought up by the other celebrities at the roundtable, Garraway was forced to explain herself. Apparently, that's just how she is. ""I'm a massive ham,"" she said. Did Claudia say 'morning' or 'mourning'? Garraway wasn't the only one struggling with her acting skills. Alan Carr - the standout sensation of episode one - was still finding it hard to keep a straight face. As the first episode of the Celebrity Traitors drew to a close on Wednesday night, we were left waiting to find out which star would be murdered by Carr in plain sight. Would he go through with it? Our hearts, collectively as a nation, were in our mouths. But murder, he did. And not just any murder. He selected singer Paloma Faith, who by his own admission is one of his ""best friends"". The following morning at breakfast, as the rest of the players tried to work out what had happened, he was all over the place - scratching his head nervously, biting his fingers. ""It was a stretch for my acting ability, I don't know how Meryl Streep does it,"" he said. And then we had Jonathan Ross - a traitor - vowing dramatically to avenge Faith. ""It was massive graveside overacting,"" said TV journalist Siobhan Synnot. They may be celebrities, but even so they're not immune from feeling the nerves - and that could explain their poor acting abilities, says Stafford. You can see why ""being in a game set around murder, betrayal and manipulation... would jangle your nerves,"" she explained. Elsewhere, fans online were relieved to know that celebrities are as bad at spelling as previous contestants. When Niko Omilana voted for Tom Daley, he spelled it “DAYLEE”. ""Niko keeping the longstanding Traitors tradition of terrible name spelling at the round table alive and well,"" wrote one X user, adding : ""It's officially Tom Daylee now, any other spelling will not be accepted."" Others said the spelling error was giving Minah vibes, after a player from season three had to correct others for spelling her name as ""Mina"". BBC/Studio Lambert The celebrities took part in a funeral scene after the Traitors were tasked with poisoning a Faithful The celebrities‘ fashion sense is also causing a bit of a stir. Ross didn't hold back - with his fur-trimmed jacket and sunnies in the pouring rain for a funeral scene. The verdict was mixed, with one X user saying he has the best wardrobe, while another argued he looks like ""your least favourite aunty"". Poor poisoned Paloma, meanwhile, told Traitors Uncloaked on BBC Two that she felt sad to be out - not only because of having more to give the show, but also because she had lots of outfits planned. The show ended on a cliffhanger - again - with fans having to wait till next week to find out who has been voted out. And that, too, is causing a stir online. ""So we won't be won't know who gets banished until Wednesday?? As in 7 days???"", wrote one X user , while others simply put a string of crying emojis.

642ecef9b0ef,Huge buzz but a big gamble: Battlefield 6 takes aim at Call of Duty,,"Huge buzz but a big gamble: Battlefield 6 takes aim at Call of Duty Georgia Levy-Collins BBC Newsbeat EA Battlefield 6 has its sights on success - but can it hit its target? ""A new challenger has appeared."" In the fiercely competitive world of video games, it's common for new contenders to fade away as quickly as they burst on to the scene. But Battlefield 6 is hoping to change that. It's the latest entry in a long-running military shooter series often framed as a grittier, more realistic answer to Call of Duty. The title's never quite managed to match its most famous rival in terms of sales or players, but there are signs the new installment could close the gap. A preview weekend giving players a chance to try out the game earlier this year broke records, and the buzz heading into its launch has been huge. But the project is still a big gamble for publisher Electronic Arts (EA), which has reportedly spent hundreds of millions of dollars making it. BBC Newsbeat's spoken to some of the makers to find out how they hope it will pay off. Four EA-owned studios have been working on the game under the Battlefield Studios banner. They include original series developer Dice, based in Sweden, Canada's Motive Studios and Ripple Effect Studios in LA. The fourth, Criterion, is based in Guildford in the UK. Rebecka Coutaz is the VP general manager of the two European studios and tells Newsbeat that, in terms of what it's offering players, ""Battlefield 6 is probably unbeatable"". EA Rebecka Coutaz is in charge of Battlefield's European studios The game comes off the back of the futuristic Battlefield 2042, released four years ago to a negative reception it struggled to recover from. ""We probably couldn't make and develop Battlefield 6 without the learnings we had in Battlefield 2042,"" Rebecka tells Newsbeat. One of those lessons was to get fans involved early, and the team launched invite-only community playtests earlier this year. Rebecka says the ""feedback was explosively positive"". Another missing ingredient from Battlefield 2042 was a single-player campaign, which has been restored this time around. Criterion design director Fasahat 'Fas' Salim is the one in charge of the studio's contribution to the campaign and ""making sure those missions are as fun and interesting as possible for the players"". Despite claims that the scale of the project had put a strain on the different studios collaborating across continents to build the game, Fas is positive about the process. ""Collaborating with different cultures, different backgrounds, it's a really interesting environment to be involved in every day,"" he says. ""This whole approach has been something new but something really exciting because we are working with people from all over the world."" As for the expectation on the team, Fas says: ""There is pressure but also it's exciting. ""It's a big project. It's probably the biggest that most of us have ever worked on."" Vlad is completing his BA in Visual Effects at Bournemouth University alongside his role at Criterion That's definitely true of at least one team member, lighting artist Vlad Kokhan. The 21-year-old makes the atmospheric effects that shape the mood, tone, and direction of the single-player campaign. He completed an internship at Criterion before getting a job there, and currently works part-time while finishing his visual effects degree at Bournemouth University. Vlad says he's a long-time fan of the Battlefield series, and remembers playing the fourth instalment of the series at a friend's house when he was younger. To be working on it now, as his first industry job, ""doesn't feel real"". ""It's really crazy seeing the marketing everywhere,"" he says. ""To know that I've put my own thing into the game is really surreal."" A hand-painted mural of the game at EA's Guildford office Battlefield 6's launch is expected to be a big one, with analysts predicting it could sell up to five millions copies in its first week . But its real success in a volatile and unpredictable industry won't be clear for months, if not years. To maintain the momentum, it will need to draw - and keep - players away from rivals including CoD, Fortnite and Roblox. But while the signs are promising, Rebecka is cautious when asked if she is feeling confident. ""I would say yes and no, you never know,"" she says. ""The only thing that matters to me now - and I've been saying it for four years - is that we don't disappoint our community, our players."" Concerns for Battlefield's future were also sparked by recent news that EA had agreed to sell the company to a Saudi Arabia-led group for $55bn (£41bn) . EA has taken on $20bn (£14bn) of debt as part of the deal - known as a leveraged buyout - prompting fans to fear of cutbacks. The company has told staff to expect ""no immediate changes"" to their jobs. For Battlefield 6, Rebecka tells Newsbeat the team will continue as planned, and has already shared details for monthly updates and content additions. ""I am here to help our team members make their best work in their careers so the way hasn't changed for me, the way is still the same,"" she insists. Fas is responsible for Criterion's work on single-player missions in the new game EA has been vocal about its plans to use generative AI in game development, and its prospective new owners are betting on the technology to boost profits, according to The Financial Times . The tools are controversial, prompting concerns from developers and backlash from some fans. Rebecka tells Newsbeat players won't see anything made by GenAI within Battlefield 6, but it is used in preparatory stages to ""to allow more time and more space to be creative"". Rebecka says GenAI ""is very seducing"", but there isn't currently a way to incorporate it into developer's daily work. Yet she shares EA's optimism for its potential. ""If we can break the magic with AI it will help us be more innovative and more creative,"" she says. In Fas's opinion, GenAI is ""not anything to be scared of in our industry"". ""Especially as we work in an environment at the bleeding edge of technology - we're kind of used to things changing,"" he says. ""It's just a matter of how we can incorporate that productively into our workflows, how can we leverage that to take our games to the next level."" For now, though, the team's focus is on nailing Battlefield 6's release. ""We spend a lot of time behind closed doors making these things,"" says Fas. ""But when it goes into the players' hands and you see them having a great time, people shouting, people excited, that's something that we worked years for. ""This is what most of us game developers look forward to. We just want to see people play the thing and then get excited about it.""

731fe4dd6ad3,"BBC sacking presenter was 'reasonable', judge finds",,"BBC sacking presenter was 'reasonable', judge finds BBC Jack Murley, from Bodmin, worked with BBC Radio Cornwall from 2019 until 2024 The BBC's decision to dismiss one of its radio presenters has been found ""reasonable"" by a judge at an employment tribunal. Jack Murley, from Bodmin, worked at BBC Radio Cornwall from 2019 until 2024, when he was sacked by the corporation. A hearing in Exeter heard how Mr Murley was dismissed for breaching the BBC's editorial and social media guidelines. The judge, Alastair Smail, said it was ""disappointing to arrive at this position"" given Mr Murley's ability as a broadcaster. Mr Smail added that because presenters for the BBC ""have access to the airwaves"" they are in a ""privileged position"". He found that the decisions made by the disciplinary hearing manager and subsequent appeal hearing manager, who were both senior leaders and experienced reporters, were ""reasonable"". The tribunal heard how from 2022 Mr Murley openly offered his views on social media about the BBC's Local Value for All project, which involved changes to local radio stations and newsrooms, across England. He was taken off air on 30 June 2023 following a heated conversation with his manager , when they discussed his use of social media. Questions were also raised about content in Mr Murley's Loosest Goose feature, a satirical radio segment that included innuendo and was said to breach BBC guidelines. Lack of contrition Mr Murley's lawyer Nick Toms argued his client had believed he was acting within the BBC's guidelines. He added that it had been unfair that the disciplinary process had not considered Mr Murley's unblemished record of 13 years with the organisation. He said when making a decision a fair employer should take into consideration his ""previous good record"". Jesse Crozier, representing the BBC told the hearing the gross misconduct consensus has been reached because of the ""irredeemable nature of the conduct"" and a lack of ""contrition"" from Mr Murley during the disciplinary process. He said the corporation had ""lost trust"" in Mr Murley and this had made a final written warning and the continuation of his role as a presenter ""impossible"". Referring to the positive aspects of the presenter's employment record, Mr Crozier said: ""You can build up your perfect employee but they do one thing that is so grievously wrong, that it doesn't matter what is on that side of the scale, they have to go."" Judge Smail outlined how he had considered the final submissions from both sides before coming to his decision. He said Mr Murley ""adopted a policy of pleading guilty to nothing"" and believed that Mr Murley ""needed to accept those breaches"" of guidelines ""before trust could be rebuilt"". This outcome follows a previous tribunal against the BBC in November 2024 which found Mr Murley's sacking had not been discrimination for being gay or a union representative.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c9310jxe300o,Entertainment,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/5597/live/75c56650-acd4-11ef-8ab9-9192db313061.jpg,2025-10-10T15:26:30.265000+00:00,6eebdd0b952f70c4645475ee0f846b6a44f4bc66

The Bristolian, known as 'Clarkey', is paired with new professional dancer Alexis Warr, and the pair made it through the most recent round performing the Paso Doble. Mr Clarke said he got on with his dance partner ""immediately"" and that he has enjoyed doing something his family can enjoy. ""My nan is over the moon. When I called her [to say he was doing the show], she was like 'Oh that's really cool',"" he told BBC Radio Bristol. The star has also revealed he injured his back during rehearsals. Speaking on his podcast, The Useless Hotline Podcast, he said: ""I had a pinched nerve all week in my back. I had acupuncture."" But he was still able to perform on Saturday night and has been back to his intense rehearsal schedule this week. Find out how Bristolian Strictly's new star George Clarke is Mr Clarke told BBC Radio Bristol there was no doubt he would say 'yes' to appearing on Strictly when he was contacted in May. ""I've always said there's two or maybe three TV shows that I feel like I couldn't say no to, and Strictly was definitely one of them,"" he said. Mr Clarke, who has no dance experience, said while he is trying to ""embrace it"" as much as he can, he soon found out the show would be a lot harder work than he initially thought. He said he had sometimes ""struggled to find strengths"" to his dancing but ""when something clicks it feels very satisfying"". Mr Clarke said he was enjoying doing something his grandparents could relate to and enjoy. While he now lives in London, Mr Clarke told the BBC he will ""always feel like a Bristol boy at heart"".

The 68-year-old has also been charged with nine counts of indecent assault and two counts of sexual assault. The charges related to seven women, with the allegations spanning from 1983 to 2016. Mr Westwood is due to appear at Westminster Magistrates' Court on 10 November. He has been charged with the following offences: In1983, a 17-year-old girl was allegedly indecently assaulted in the Fulham area of London. In 1986, a woman in her 20s was allegedly indecently assaulted in the Vauxhall area of London. Between 1995 and 1996, a female between the age of 17-18 was allegedly raped in London. It is also alleged that the same woman was indecently assaulted in central London within the same timeframe. Between 2000 and 2001, a female between the age of 17-18 was allegedly raped and indecently assaulted in London. In 2010, a woman in her 20s was allegedly raped in London. In 2010, a woman in her 20s was allegedly sexually assaulted in Stroud. In 2016, a woman in her 20s was allegedly sexually assaulted in the Finchley area of London.

""It is extremely important that there be no reporting, commentary or sharing of information online which could in any way prejudice these proceedings."" Detective Superintendent Andy Furphy of the Metropolitan Police continued to appeal for further witnesses, and said: ""It takes courage to come forward and report allegations of this nature."" Mr Westwood was an early champion of hip-hop in the UK and came to public attention when he began hosting his rap show on Radio 1 from 1994.

cea4d9bba065,From the fishing trip to a Gavin and Stacey film - five things Jones and Corden's book reveals,,"From the fishing trip to a Gavin and Stacey film - five things Jones and Corden's book reveals Getty Images Corden says the pair's friendship is one of the things he is most proud of When Ruth Jones and James Corden first met in 2000, they never imagined it would lead to 22 episodes of a record-breaking TV show. The pair were filming Fat Friends at the Crowne Plaza in Leeds and formed an unexpected friendship . Now their book When Gavin Met Stacey is out, revealing how an argument inspired one iconic scene, and a scrapped storyline idea that would have seen Gavin have an affair. The book is a story of love and friendship, and here are some of the things we have learned: 1. The fishing trip scene was filmed - but never made the final cut A video showing unseen material from the infamous fishing trip was previously shown in a Gavin and Stacey documentary For years, the infamous fishing trip involving Bryn and his nephew Jason has been wrapped in secrecy and speculation. In the long-awaited finale, Gwen delivers a line that reignites the intrigue: ""Their trip 30 years ago almost tore this family apart."" That's all we know, along with clues that they were on their knees, it was freezing cold, and whatever happened was ""completely legal in this country"". While fans were given a glimpse of the pair's escapades , in true Gavin and Stacey fashion the secret was never revealed. But during an event to promote their new book Jones and Corden revealed that a scene shedding light on the mystery was actually filmed. It featured Bryn clearing out his home when he stumbles upon a camcorder tape labelled ""The Fishing Trip"". Jason walks in, stunned, and asks Bryn why he still has it. He then requests to watch it, but Bryn refuses. Jones and Corden explained that the idea was for the tape to play and just as viewers brace for the big reveal, the footage fuzzes out and jams. The scene was dropped in the final edit due to time constraints, ultimately leaving the secret safely tucked away with Bryn, Jason… and Dave Coaches. As for what really happened? Jones confessed: ""I have completely stolen James's idea for the answer to what happened on the fishing trip. I say 'I don't know because I wasn't there'."" 2. Row between Corden and Jones led to an iconic scene Getty Images Adrian Scarborough played Pete Sutcliffe and Julia Davis played his wife, Dawn in the series Corden refers to this as the ""Easter egg row"", with Jones saying it is all ""a little bit vague"", but she was travelling up from Cardiff for a writing session for series two and was meeting Corden in London. Jones continues that she had a message from James Thornton, Joanna Page's husband a few days earlier as he had a script idea and asked if she would mind reading it. ""So I texted back to say, 'Oh yes, by all means send me the script and I'll have a look. Don't know if I can help but I'm happy to have a look'."" She continues that instead of sending the text to James Thornton she sent it to Corden, and messaged him saying ""Sorry that wasn't meant for you"". Corden asked who was it for? ""And I don't know what possessed me, but I just went 'Oh it doesn't matter, I cant tell you about it'. And for some bizarre reason you went, 'Oh my god, are you doing Doctor Who?' and I said 'I'm sorry I cant tell you because I've signed a confidentiality clause."" BBC/Baby Cow Productions/Neil Bennett Gavin and Stacey was first screened in 2007 Jones says Corden was furious with her. ""I was basically playing a joke on you, which I rarely do because I'm not really a wind up merchant,"" adding that Corden is. She adds she was enjoying teasing Corden, but then he took it badly and said ""just forget it, I'm going to Benidorm"". Jones said she was really cross, but the pair made up in the hotel bar, and Jones told Corden she was just winding him up, and they went across the road and bought some Easter eggs. Corden said they bought two giant Cadbury's Easter eggs, and lay on the hotel bed, opened them and laid there with chocolate eggs on their faces. ""It was shortly after that we wrote Dawn and Pete's vows, when she changes the words to lyrics of Michael Jackson's 'Ben'. Jones added: ""We had a sugar rush, had a sugar low, fell asleep woke up and wrote the vows scene. ""I remember getting really hysterical writing it. It was absolutely joyous, it was magic."" 3. Stephen Fretwell didn't want his song to be the theme song Getty Images Corden and Jones came up with the idea for the series when they both met when they were filming Fat Friends Corden really loves the Stephen Fretwell album Magpie and for a long time they thought about having a piece of written score as the theme. Corden says: ""A few different people like David Arnold wrote pieces, and wrote one piece with a Welsh harp, it was beautiful but didn't feel right. ""I kept saying how I really love that drum sound and the piano chords on the Stephen Fretwell song Run."" Corden continues that the The Office and The Royale Family inspired them, with both shows having simple title sequences, but Gavin and Stacey couldn't afford one. ""We went with a black card with white writing and I wouldn't change it for the world, and I kept saying 'let's have something that feels a bit like Run' and then in the end it was like 'what if it's that',"" adding that on some level the lyrics in the song feel like Nessa and Smithy's relationship. During the London event, the co-creators of the BBC show also met Fretwell for the first time, where he confessed he has initially told his agent he didn't want his song used for the programme. 4. Corden's 40th birthday in Mexico led to the 2019 special PA Corden and James co-wrote and starred in the series Jones reveals it was Corden's wife Jules inviting her to Mexico for his 40th that clinched the 2019 special happening. Corden said as soon as Jones walked in he burst into tears and was so ""unbelievably happy to see you"". He says they had the ""best weekend"" adding the couple had always laughed about the fact that Jones had sung Wild Thing at her wedding after a few drinks, and one of his greatest regrets was he wasn't there because they didn't know each other. At Corden's 40th, Jones got up and sang Wild Thing, improvising the lyrics to make them specific to Corden. ""I just remember singing and seeing your face. The joy on your face,"" she says. Corden adds: ""Harry Styles was going to you 'I cant believe you just did that',"" with Jones saying: ""Yeah he looked a bit in shock, I don't know if it was in a good way or bad way'."" BBC/Toffee International Ltd./Tom Jackson The series finale aired on Christmas Day 2024 During the trip Corden suggested it ""might be time"" to do more Gavin and Stacey. ""I came back from the Mexico trip in 2018 thinking 'right, lets do this',"" Jones says. As they were writing the 2019 finale, they had the idea of doing two specials, with one being a secret and storyline ideas including Gavin having an affair. ""So the first would air on Christmas Day and the second on New Year's Day, we even thought that the BBC could put something fake in the listings,"" Corden says. But the task was a ""big challenge"" because of the 10-year gap, and the pair thought it would not work. 5. The finale could have been a film in cinemas PA Media The co-creators originally saw the finale as a cinema film, before opting for a 90 minute tv episode The pair reveal that in August 2023 they started talking about doing one more, potentially a film to be released in cinemas - but changed their minds. Corden says: ""The fact is they've always been in the corner of your room and that is where they should remain."" Jones adds: ""When we started the show 20 years ago the idea it would be one of those shows that had a Christmas special was far beyond anything we hever dreamed of. ""Just the notion of BBC One on Christmas Day. That means so much to us."" Corden and Jones said the book came about because they felt it would be nice for fans of the show to find out what their relationship was like and also explore the journey that started back in 2000 in Leeds and ended in Barry last Christmas Corden says they wrote with the same freedom they always had and didn't tell the BBC until they had written 65 pages. The pair added they originally thought the 2019 special would be the ending, had it not had the cliffhanger. ""We knew it our hearts that the absolute had to be that Smithy and Nessa finally got together . Got married."" PA Media The Christmas Day episode in 2024 became one of the most watched scripted TV shows of the century Corden says without Jones passion for Gavin and Stacey he would have let the idea go by the wayside. He says: ""When I think about Gavin and Stacey I think about the word friend and what it means. ""I got to make this show with somebody who knows me better than I know myself... I just don't think I'll have a friendship like it again in my life."" But what next? They're working on something new , and seeing where they go with it. ""Nothing may come of it. That's always a possibility. But I love it,"" says Jones.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cwy809dgd4zo,Entertainment,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/5567/live/32604410-a5c7-11f0-b741-177e3e2c2fc7.jpg,2025-10-09T17:03:16.321000+00:00,5baf9a82ad9da52becd22e16fda7a2c7a1792afe
7714d1979b59,From Happy Valley to Riot Women: Why writer Sally Wainwright wants to shout about menopause,,"From Happy Valley to Riot Women: Why writer Sally Wainwright wants to shout about menopause Paul Glynn Culture reporter BBC Pictures Amelia Bullmore and Rosalie Craig play two members of the rock band Sally Wainwright has said she aimed to create an ""uplifting"" portrayal of midlife, including the menopause, through the story of a female rock band in her new TV series Riot Women. Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Woman's Hour on Thursday, the Happy Valley writer said the show, which starts on Sunday, draws from her own midlife experiences. ""It's very personal for me this,"" she said. ""It's a lot about what I was going through at what [actress] Tamsin [Greig] very eloquently called 'the middle squeeze'."" She added: ""It's just about midlife - menopause is just an aspect of that - and I wanted to find a way of writing about this part of your life in a way that was uplifting and engaging and interesting."" Getty Images Lorraine Ashbourne, Sally Wainwright, Rosalie Craig, Joanna Scanlan, Tamsin Greig and Amelia Bullmore attended a recent launch for the show She continued: ""It's about women who find something very creative and very engaging to do together and how it changes their lives."" Riot Women tells the tale of five menopausal women who form a punk rock band to take part in a local talent contest. It features stage and screen star Rosalie Craig as the chaotic Kitty Eckersley, alongside an ensemble cast of bandmates including Friday Night Dinner star Greig, Gentleman Jack's Amelia Bullmore, Lorraine Ashbourne from Alma's Not Normal and The Thick of It comic actress Joanna Scanlan. Together the women foster a sense of solidarity and address their experiences candidly. Wainwright, the Bafta-winning writer from Huddersfield, said she'd always wanted to write something as a sort of tribute to the 1970s musical drama Rock Follies. She started to think about it properly about 10 years ago when she working on the one-off BBC drama To Walk Invisible, about the lives and literary achievements of the Brontë sisters. ""At around that time, my mum started to develop dementia, and I felt I was being pulled in so many different directions,"" she explained to presenter Anita Rani. ""I still had two boys at home, one just about to go to university, the other one thinking about what he was going to do, education wise."" She added: ""You know that adage about if something needs doing, ask a busy woman?... I was that woman who just was being expected lots of - in a good way. You're often at the height of your career. ""And so you've been pulled in all sorts of directions and balancing a huge amount of things, and in the middle of that the menopause started."" She noted how along with hot flushes, brain fog and a low mood, it had brought with it a kind of ""low self esteem that you don't expect"". ""It just seemed well worth writing about,"" she said, noting how it had been like ""therapy"" to do so. Rosalie Craig as Kitty Eckersley in the show The writer felt it was neccessary and useful for the cast to learn to play their instruments and perform live for the series, on songs such as Seeing Red and Just Like Your Mother. Craig - who starred in Stephen Sondheim's Company on the West End - told the same programme it was ""phenomenal"" to be asked to portray the carefree and at-times shameless frontwoman, Kitty. ""She's constructed somebody who doesn't have a filter, and that's partly because of what she's been through in life, and being the victim of aggression,"" said Craig. ""She faces the world like that, with two fists,"" she went on. ""She exorcises herself through the use of song, which was really brilliant to do.""

0f862a5c6c94,"Stars, secrets and slip-ups: Celebrity Traitors is off to a cracking start",,"Stars, secrets and slip-ups: Celebrity Traitors is off to a cracking start Steven McIntosh Entertainment reporter BBC Host Claudia Winkleman said she was initially reluctant to do a celebrity version of the series Spoiler warning: This article reveals details from the first episode of The Celebrity Traitors TV shows with famous contestants usually have a loose definition of the word ""celebrity"". But there are no recycled Love Islanders among the 19 stars in the first series of The Celebrity Traitors, which has got off to a cracking start. ""When they came to me and said they wanted to do a celebrity version, I said, 'Oh I don't think we should do that, I like just doing it non-celeb',"" said host Claudia Winkleman at the show's launch, only half joking. ""Thankfully I have absolutely zero power, because they said, 'Well, these are the people who have expressed interest.' And I couldn't believe it."" Granted, it's worth keeping things in perspective. It's not Taylor Swift and Tom Cruise entering Ardross Castle near Inverness. But frankly, if Kate Garraway is on board, so are we. The ITV daytime star was joined by Jonathan Ross, Celia Imrie, Sir Stephen Fry and other familiar names as the series got under way on Wednesday. Here are six highlights from the opening episode. 1. The celebrities want to make each other laugh As you'd expect, the celebrities are extremely comfortable in front of the cameras,  creating a fun new dynamic and giving the show a new lease of life. Many of them already knew each other and had an immediate confidence that the regular contestants don't. All of them evidently know and love the format, and there were some genuinely funny moments as the stars tried to make each other laugh. ""What was your name again?"" joked singer Paloma Faith (a faithful, appropriately) as she introduced herself to her fellow players in the car ""I'm worse than Linda!"" remarked comedian Alan Carr later, referencing the notoriously awful but lovable traitor from series three When TV presenter Clare Balding pointed out that banishments were decided by a vote, Carr told her: ""God, you're looking beautiful today"" Later, Faith brilliantly pretended to drop dead on the round table after drinking an apparently poisoned glass of water just after the traitors had been selected The stars were even happy to make jokes about being traitors. As they left the round table, Sir Stephen shouted: ""Traitors stay behind please!"" while Ross commented later: ""See you in the turret!"" 2. Alan Carr is extremely good value ""You know what celebrities are like: two-faced!"" said Carr during the episode Making the comedian a traitor was exactly the kind of brilliant casting decision we were hoping for. (""How could you not?"" said Claudia.) In the first episode, Carr was panicked, sweating and generally squirming over being a traitor. ""I feel sick,"" he said. ""It's the worst secret ever and it's just burning me, I'm so nervous."" He is a delight to watch - even just the sight of him strolling the corridors with his hood up trying to look menacing makes you laugh. ""I've had to have my cloak taken out because I'm so fat,"" he joked in the first traitors' meeting in the turret. The traitors were completed by chat show host Ross and singer Cat Burns - both of whom seem to have more of the conniving mindset needed for a great traitor. But Carr is the truly inspired choice. ""My aim was to go under the radar, and I think I've pole-vaulted over it,"" he reflected at one point. We're in for some fantastic memes. 3. The celebrities literally dig their own graves Comedian Lucy Beaumont and actor Mark Bonnar failed to find the shields hidden in their graves Instead of the traditional arrival by train, the stars were driven to a graveyard and set an opening challenge that saw them dig through soil in search of six available shields. The lucky recipients included Ross, Garraway, rugby player Joe Marler, comedian Joe Wilkinson and singer Charlotte Church. The sixth shield finder was actress Celia Imrie - albeit helped by Ted Lasso star Nick Mohammed. ""My aim was to try and get Celia a shield, because I love her,"" he explained. But this is exactly the sort of kindness that can make people suspicious in this show, so he'd better tread carefully. Messing with the format isn't always a success - who can forget the disastrous ""Seer"" twist that ruined the climax of the last series? - but this was a terrific new task, especially Carr's disappointment that the shield he thought he'd found was actually a rock. 4. Clare Balding is a liability in missions The contestants were challenged to pull a giant Trojan Horse up a hill and through a series of gates that each required a special code, before eventually setting the horse alight. Unfortunately, Balding locked in an incorrect combination at the first gate before the contestants had even begun tackling the puzzle, not realising you only got one chance to enter the code. ""No! I didn't realise I locked it in, sorry!"" she shouted. ""I've made a complete mistake there."" She explained later: ""I thought, oh we can guess lots of numbers, so while they're working that out, I'll just stick a number in."" ""I would've done exactly the same,"" sympathised Winkleman. ""She was mortified, she really was, I felt terrible for her."" The mission raised a few eyebrows - some were suspicious that Church gave up her shield so willingly in exchange for Balding's error, while swimmer Tom Daley suspected Balding might have deliberately sabotaged the task because she's a traitor. Luckily, the rest of the task went well, partly thanks to Mohammed, whom Garraway described as a ""puzzle ninja"". Ultimately the contestants completed the mission, would you believe it, with just moments to spare. 5. It's a whole new ball game with celebrities Some fans were nervous about the celebrity spin-off, but the bottom line is: it works. ""It's not often in our sheltered world that we are put in a position where we have no idea how we're going to react,"" noted Sir Stephen. ""I don't want to incriminate myself, but I've always wanted to murder a celebrity,"" added Ross. But in some ways, the fact that the contestants are well-known makes strategising harder. ""I was thinking about going in speaking Welsh and pretending I've actually been Welsh all this time. Sort of a reverse of Charlotte,"" joked comedian Lucy Beaumont, referring to the last traitor standing in series three. The celebrities are playing for a £100,000 prize for their chosen charity (although they also receive a separate appearance fee). ""You think you know these people,"" Winkleman reflected, ""and then you watch them play this game, and I was awestruck by the way they played it - with empathy, with wit and with real smarts."" 6. The cliffhanger is unbearable Despite its extended running time, the episode ended without a murder or a banishment, leaving us with a huge number of questions. We didn't find out if the celebrities were any better than previous contestants at spelling each other's names at the round table, or whether there would be another outbreak of players telling each other: ""I'm voting for yourself."" But we know there will be drama. ""Did the roundtables get heated? Yes,"" said Winkleman. ""They're polite, but they want to catch the traitors, and the traitors want to remain undetected, and both parties are excellent at what they do."" Sir Stephen's total dismissal of the ""gut instinct"" tactic was particularly refreshing. ""The idea that you can be good at reading people is absolute nonsense, and it's just like astrology or anything else,"" he said before heading into the castle. ""Woo woo. You just can't do it. ""We can all be convinced, even though the facts tell us otherwise. These notions of 'I just knew, it's the way he lifted his glass, his eye doing that thing' – all nonsense."" As the episode drew to a close, the most pressing question was which star would be murdered by Carr in plain sight. ""I can't believe they've left me to it,"" he said. ""I have people I want to kill, but it's not going to be easy. What am I going to do?"" We can't wait to find out.

2331035d7c85,From folklore to fashion - how the Armagh Rhymers stole the show at McQueen,,"From folklore to fashion - how the Armagh Rhymers stole the show at McQueen Alexandra Rosbotham BBC News NI Photography courtesy of McQueen The Armagh Rhymers - known for their striking costumes - help to preserve an ancient Irish tradition of masked folk theatre and ritual performances From the ancient Irish practice of mumming to walking the red carpet, the Armagh Rhymers were central to a meeting of myth and couture for McQueen's Paris Fashion Week show. The local theatre and performance group have been committed to carrying the rural custom of ""mumming"" or ""rhyming"" into the 21st century, and in doing so caught the attention of McQueen's creative director, Seán McGirr. Historically, mumming saw groups dress up in masks and costume, going from house to house to perform poetry, theatre, music and dance. Often communities used this to mark important times in their calendar. ""When we got the e-mail in July, we weren't sure it was real. McQueen is such a fashion behemoth, their shows are so beautiful and known for their theatrics,"" said programme manager Clare Jennings. ""The creative director Seán McGirr is Irish and is very inspired by Irish culture, history and heritage, incorporating Irish folklore and mythology in the shows and in the collections. It just seemed like a really natural fit."" Handout Clare has been a member of the Armagh Rhymers for four years The group worked with local straw craft workers to produce large straw maypole toppers which were then used as part of the set. Craft artist Moira Burns hand-made more than 500 harvest knots. Traditionally thought to be a love token, the harvest knots were used as invites for guests. Photography courtesy of McQueen Hessian ribbons and straw maypole toppers made up the set for the show (left) and VIP invites included wheat harvest knots handmade in Armagh (right) Armagh to Paris Clare, alongside Creative Director and co-founder Dara Vallely and board member and volunteer Anne Hart travelled to participate in McQueen's Spring/Summer 2026 show in Paris. ""We were in traditional mask and costume on the red carpet as guests arrived,"" Clare told BBC News NI. ""It was a really an amazing opportunity to showcase the local heritage and craft that we do have here, and for a fashion house like McQueen to see the beauty and the value in our local craft."" Often performing community groups or visiting schools, a haute couture show is a departure from the Armagh Rhymers day-to-day schedule. ""When Dara started the Rhymers nearly 50 years ago now, a lot of these ancient traditions were in danger of dying out or being forgotten about, so we feel very lucky that Seán McGirr was so interested in the ancient tradition of mumming and what we do,"" Anne added. Photography courtesy of McQueen Clare, Dara and Anne backstage at the McQueen Paris Fashion Week show Irish fashion success Earlier in the Paris Fashion Week schedule, another designer from the island of Ireland made history in the world of high fashion. Johnathan Anderson, who grew up in Magherafelt, County Londonderry unveiled his debut women's collection for Dior. This comes after the announcement that he would be the first designer since Christian Dior to lead both the men's and women's lines at the French fashion house.

464832ad9e6c,Romesh Ranganathan on overexposure and acting with Sheridan Smith,,"Romesh Ranganathan on overexposure and acting with Sheridan Smith Steven McIntosh Entertainment reporter BBC Ranganathan will star in a new West End production of Woman in Mind opposite Sheridan Smith Comedian Romesh Ranganathan will make his West End debut later this year, co-starring in a play with Sheridan Smith. But although it's his first time acting on stage, he tells BBC News he's aware of the risks of overexposure. The 47-year-old is already one of the most familiar faces in British entertainment, with a CV that includes The Weakest Link, A League of Their Own, a BBC Radio 2 show, hosting the TV Baftas, and several documentaries and sitcoms. From December, Ranganathan will also appear in a new production of Alan Ayckbourn's Woman in Mind. But taking on new roles isn't without risk, in an entertainment landscape where the public can grow tired of seeing the same stars. ""Well, I just want to put this out there, and I'd love you to publicise this as much as possible: I do say no to stuff,"" Ranganathan jokes to BBC News. ""I'm not just walking around taking whatever's offered. ""The truth is, people say to me 'you're on everything' - that accusation has been levelled at me. ""But I feel like whenever I'm thinking about doing something, I'm just asking, do I think think this will be good, is it something I'd watch, is it something I think I'd be able to do a decent job at? And then, if the answer to those questions is yes, that's what makes you do it. ""I mean, obviously I need a fee as well,"" he laughs, ""there's no point in doing it totally for the love of the game."" Ranganathan hosts TV quiz The Weakest Link (pictured) and a BBC Radio 2 weekend show Many figures at the very top of television - Ant and Dec, Michael McIntyre and Claudia Winkleman - are selective with their choices, notably hosting no more than three or four shows each per year. But when a particular star is in demand, it can be tricky to strike the delicate balance between saying yes to work while not taking on too much. ""I understand the thing about overexposure, but if that happens, it happens,"" Ranganathan reflects. ""I try not to overthink things that much, to be honest. ""You normally just have a gut feeling whether something's good or not or whether you'll be good for it or not. ""But who knows, maybe after this play goes out, the general public might say 'OK we've had enough', and I'll go and work in a café or something."" Ranganathan will join the previously announced Smith in Woman in Mind, which will run at London's Duke of York's Theatre from 9 December until 28 February, before playing additional dates in Sunderland and Glasgow in March. Ayckbourn's psychological comedy follows a woman named Susan, who has an accident that leaves her with a head injury. A new fantasy life emerges in front of her, before the line between her real and imagined lives begins to blur. ""I play her doctor, who basically is the only link between the two worlds throughout the play,"" Ranganathan explains. Sheridan Smith told Radio 2's Scott Mills she was ""so excited"" to be starring in the show Smith shot to fame in the early noughties sitcoms The Royle Family and Two Pints of Lager and a Packet of Crisps, and went on to appear in The Railway Children Return and ITV's Cilla, which saw her portray the legendary British entertainer Cilla Black. But she also has a huge number of stage credits - she led West End hits such as Funny Girl and Shirley Valentine, and has won two Olivier Awards for her roles in Legally Blonde and Flare Path. Announcing her role in Woman in Mind last month, Smith told BBC Radio 2's Scott Mills : ""I'm so excited, this is an amazing part for an actress. ""It's thought of as one of Alan Ayckbourn's finest plays, it's really funny and it's got a lot of darkness as it goes on. ""There are loads of characters, it's just bonkers and brilliant, it's kind of like a big farce. I can't wait to get started."" Working with Sheridan 'exciting but intimidating' Woman in Mind premiered in 1985 and has since been revived in the US and the UK several times. Stockard Channing, Julia McKenzie and Dame Helen Mirren have all previously played the role of Susan. Ranganathan says he and Smith had a text exchange when he was cast, adding: ""It's both exciting and intimidating, because she's obviously incredibly talented, phenomenal at what she does, so it's an honour to be doing it opposite her. ""But also what it means is my abilities will be in sharp contrast to that, so there's a little bit of added pressure. But we're both excited, I've not worked with her before so I'm looking forward to that."" Oliver Rosser Ranganathan (pictured in character with his stethoscope) plays Susan's doctor in the show The comic has previously acted in TV sitcoms such as Avoidance and Romantic Getaway, but this will mark his first time acting on stage. ""Well, since primary school"", he laughs. ""I might have played second shepherd in the Nativity."" Ranganathan says he feels ""nervous"" about his West End debut, but adds: ""It was something I'd been thinking about doing for a while. ""I'd been talking about it for maybe a year or two, my wife is an ex-drama teacher and has a real passion for theatre, so it's something I started discussing, but I didn't know what it would be. This kind of popped up and they were kind enough to let me read for it, and it felt like an opportunity too good to miss."" The new adaptation will be directed by Michael Longhurst, with Ranganathan noting: ""It's going to be very close to the source material, but the way it might be performed and presented might be a little bit different. ""But what I want to do is allay any fears that we might decide to rap it,"" he jokes. ""There's nothing like that in the works.""

ded8eeae477b,How Stacey Solomon decluttered our homes back from the brink,,"How Stacey Solomon decluttered our homes back from the brink BBC Sheeny and Sohan were delighted by the transformation done by Stacey's team Has your home become messy without you even realising? Wanting the next best thing, holding on to things for sentimental reasons or just a lack of time to sort through your space can all mean you end up with too much stuff. Sort Your Life Out hosted by Stacey Solomon helps people declutter and shows the transformational impact that getting rid of things you don't need can have on your family and home. If you're struggling to clear items in your home, here are how three different families  who took part in the series managed it and the one key realisation that helped them do it. For more practical advice on how to clear your space click here I don't want my kids to buy things to feel good Sheeny Aphabhai-Heer lives with her partner Sohan, and children Milly, 22, Leila, 9 and Ethan, 4. The house is piled high with clothes, shoes, suitcases and kitchen equipment, meaning they have to eat separately at mealtimes as there isn't enough space to sit together. This lack of space also means it is a struggle for daughter Milly to work from home. Sheeny had Milly when she was 17 and in a difficult marriage. She managed to leave the marriage and buy her own house as a single mum. ""My mum's a superwoman, she's been through a lot in her life and she came out of there knowing she had to do her best and provide for me,"" says daughter Milly. When Sheeny started to earn money, she wanted things that she could be proud of, and the purchases increased from there. She says she often spends nights scrolling through shopping apps like Vinted, but wants to break this cycle for her kids. ""I noticed a growing trend in Milly and Leila. When something new is happening, they want a new outfit. ""That's my habit. Buying something new to feel good cannot be the legacy I give to my children."" By letting go of her clothes and shoes, Sheeny wants to be an example to her kids, showing that she can change and break the constant cycle of shopping. It was this realisation which enabled the Aphabhai-Heers' to get rid of just over 40% of their belongings. This meant Stacey Solomon and her team were able to transform the dining room with added desk space for Milly to work, and there was also enough space for the family to be able to eat meals together again. ""It's literally changed the dynamic of our family,"" says Sheeny. Giving away my wife's things didn't mean we'd forget her Craig Bufton is a single dad to two daughters, Wren, 4 and Merywen, 6. After Craig's wife Lois gave birth to Wren she was constantly exhausted. Eventually she was diagnosed with cancer, dying just eight months later. As a widowed father, the clutter built up as Craig focused on raising the girls as a single parent. He struggled to tackle the house as he couldn't face dealing with sentimental items tied to Lois, such as storybooks she wrote for the children, photos and a hoard of Christmas items she loved. ""There's just so much sentimental stuff and so many of our plans that aren't going to happen anymore."" His office also got out of control as paperwork piled up, and the living room ended up covered in toys and different hobby equipment. ""It took me a really long time to realise I was buying stuff to just get the dopamine hit out of it. So much of the stuff I have is 'oh this will make me happy' and it did for about 20 minutes."" Craig eventually decided to take action to create a house that was a special and relaxing place for his two daughters to grow up. Craig (centre) and his two daughters Merywen and Wren with the Sort Your Life Out team. The key to doing this was to let go of sentimental items tied to Lois. Stacey and her team encouraged Craig to focus on the items he was keeping because they had real meaning and memories, and not the things he was letting go of. One example is Lois' Christmas baubles, which Craig disliked. Rather than keep them all anyway, he held onto specific baubles for their daughters. Decluttering like this enabled him to downsize his office, creating a space for him to work downstairs instead. And in the place of his office they created a special reading room for the girls. This space meant Lois' love for stories and writing was kept alive, with her books on full display. The family now has the space to eat together, and a room where Craig can read Lois' storybooks to their children. Since this episode aired, Craig has found a new partner and has moved house with his daughters. Other stories you may enjoy Time with my kids was more important than crafting The Clarke family consists of mum Sarah, dad Jon, and children Timeon, 14, Owen, 9 and Caitlin, 11. Sarah is an avid crafts enthusiast, with an abundance of yarn, beads and other art materials in her home. Currently, her younger children, Owen and Caitlin,  share a room, and Sarah's crafts mean that a room that could be used for one of them can't be. The clutter of books, board games and toys in their house means making space for the family to sit and chat together is incredibly hard. Both Sarah and Jon are deaf, and mum Sarah finds making crafts a way for her to destress from everyday life. ""I like making things, it makes me feel good, creativity is therapeutic, it makes me calmer and relaxed."" ""My mum holds everything dear to her heart"" says Timeon. The team found an array of unfinished craft items all over the house, including an unfinished crochet bag from 15 years ago. Sarah feels a lot of guilt because she knew the time with her children was being impacted. ""I do lots with them but it doesn't stop the guilt being real."" Having the team come in helped her realise she had to prioritise time with the kids over her crafts. ""Children grow up faster, and my projects will always be there."" It was this realisation which helped her to let go of half of their items. Owen and Caitlin were able to have their own rooms, as Sarah's crafts were compacted into the living room in a large cupboard. After decluttering, Jon says there has been a massive improvement in their family life and now they are able to spend quality time together to sit and chat.

e67ac2564fe3,'They operated under a cloud of fear': A secret history of gay people in the US military,,"A unique depiction of military life Now Boots shines a spotlight on the courage and resilience of service members, who sublimated an integral part of their identity in order to serve. Created by Andy Parker, whose previous credits include Netflix's adaptation of Armistead Maupin's LGBT literary classic Tales of the City, Boots is faithful to the spirit of Cope White's book, which is candid, comedic and bigger on positivity than pity. Miles Heizer stars as Cameron, a closeted gay teenager who enlists in a Marine Corps boot camp in a desperate effort to belong – much as Cope White did. ""I know I'm a man, but society was telling me that I was less than [because of my sexuality],"" the author recalls. ""I went into that environment to find my place in the masculine world, even though it's potentially the roughest place to find that."" But at the same time, the eight-part series makes significant changes to the book's scope and setting. Where Cope White began boot camp in 1979, Boots relocates the action to 1990, just four years before ""don't ask, don't tell"" was introduced. If the series is renewed for further seasons, as Parker hopes, this policy should provide plenty of dramatic grist to go with the other storylines. ""Our gay main character certainly has a secret that's very high stakes for him in that environment,"" Parker says, ""but everybody he meets there also has something they're hiding or running from. That commonality felt, to me, like an interesting thing to explore."" Getty Images Gay rights activists in the 1990s protesting against the US military's ""don't ask, don't tell"" policy (Credit: Getty Images) Even with its homoerotic frisson, this sense of absurdity reflects what was a desperately sad and destructive real-life situation for many service members. ""Some of the former marines who worked on this series [as historical advisers] aren't gay, but they found these policies just as absurd [as their gay counterparts],"" Parker says, pointing to the way they seemed ""completely counterintuitive to the social cohesion"" at the core of military life. Cope White says his main reason for leaving the Marines after six years of service was the constant toll of lying – something Cameron has to navigate throughout the series.

a39dd14a022d,Eight of the UK's cosiest thatched cottages,,"Alamy (Credit: Alamy) Blackhouse thatched cottage in the Hebrides, Scotland Many thatched cottages in the Hebrides are simple, single-storey structures called blackhouses or taigh-dubh (their name in Gaelic). The term blackhouse probably derives from the fact that these cottages originally had no windows. This type of cottage has 3ft-to-6ft (1m-to-2m) stone walls to help it withstand severe Atlantic storms. Wood here is in short supply and only used for roof timbers. The buildings' rooves normally have a turf base covered with thatch. These layers are traditionally stripped off in June and used as manure to cover local crops. Peter Landers Photography (Credit: Peter Landers Photography) Thatched building at Abigail Hopkins and Amir Sanei's home in Suffolk Architects Hopkins and Sanei designed their contemporary family home, Housestead, as a set of separate structures, each serving an individual function. The living room, housed in one, has a clean-lined thatched roof and boasts bubblegum-pink steel columns, adding a bold, playful touch. The building that houses their living room ""captures the spirit of cosy culture as I see it"", says Hopkins. ""I think cosy culture resonates so widely because it speaks to a universal need for warmth, comfort and togetherness in contrast to the uncertainties of the world today. Whether found in Wales, Scotland or Norway, where it's called koselig , this tradition captures the same instinct to create protective yet inviting spaces that celebrate simple pleasures. ""In an increasingly fast-paced, digital world, this idea of sanctuary and shared experience feels rooted and enduring. Our living area is a warm, light-filled place that feels both sheltered and open, allowing you to watch winter rain lash against the glass while you remain cocooned in comfort yet immersed in nature."" Gilbert McCarragher (Credit: Gilbert McCarragher) Oxfordshire thatched house by Richard Parr Associates This is another example of a contemporary treatment of a thatched home. Made using materials such as English oak, stone and thatch, it was designed to complement its rural setting. British thatched roofs often have very ornate ridges but, in this case, Parr has designed one with sharp, modern lines. He sees thatching as malleable and flexible, and likens it to hair that can be cut in any number of styles. ""In our buildings we use thatch as a contemporary roofing solution,"" he says. ""While we might face planning restrictions, we're using this material in exciting ways that also go beyond superficial aesthetics. So far we have received no resistance from planning authorities. There is a freedom to innovate with the material."" -- If you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.

The flag was first flown on 1 January 1801, when the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland came into being. Since the Anglo-Irish Treaty of 1921, the red has represented Northern Ireland. Alamy The Death of Major Peirson by John Singleton Copley (1783) portrays a moment of British victory against a French invasion of Jersey (Credit: Alamy) Why no Wales, the other nation that makes up Britain (England, Scotland and Wales) and the United Kingdom (England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland)? Because in 1283 Edward I conquered the rebellious Welsh. To underline his supremacy, Edward made his son the Prince of Wales. As a principality, rather than a kingdom, Wales is regarded as being represented by the cross of St George. It was declared in Parliament in 1908 that ""the union jack should be regarded as the national flag"". Along with the United States' stars and stripes, the union jack is arguably the most recognised flag in the world. ""I think in terms of longevity, influence and representation in different spheres, the union jack is absolutely iconic,"" Nick Groom says. He points out that the flag is easily recognisable from just a small portion of it, or when rendered in different colours or in black and white. A symbol of Empire Although originally a royal flag, the Union flag gradually became the symbol of Britain and then the UK. And as Britain grew as a colonial power and its empire spread, the union jack, which at one time flew over roughly a quarter of the world's population and landmass, became synonymous with subjugation and exploitation for those peoples of imperial territories who wanted independence. For many, the flag still carries connotations of colonialism as well as unsettling associations with Britian's role in the transatlantic slave trade .",https://www.bbc.com/culture/article/20251007-the-turbulent-history-of-the-union-jack-flag,Culture,BBC,,https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/624x351/p0m77kz4.jpg,2025-10-08T11:00:00+00:00,62fc1340bd8561d48d8a75a0f2b833b7f7acc8f7
87f8bfa3bd38,'Lee Miller was the bravest person I ever knew': The pioneering photographer who captured the horror of World War Two,,"Miller's headstrong creativity is evoked by her wry quotes; she once explained of her work: ""It was a matter of getting out on a damn limb, and sawing it off behind you."" The urgency, audaciousness, and unexpected compassion that defines so much of her photography is also inextricably linked to her personal experience. She was born in 1907 in Poughkeepsie, New York State; she began her global adventures in her youth, though her ultimate home was Farleys House in the East Sussex countryside, where she moved in 1949 with her husband, British painter and curator Roland Penrose, and their infant son Antony. It was only following Miller's death in 1977 that her family discovered a huge cache of her previously unseen negatives, personal letters and manuscripts. Traumatic details This proved a multi-stranded revelation. It uncovered traumatic details that Miller had never openly discussed – the childhood sexual abuse she had suffered (aged seven, she was abused by a family acquaintance) and the full extent of the World War Two horrors she had witnessed. For Antony Penrose, it also brought focus to his mother's undiagnosed post-traumatic stress disorder, and their icy relationship, which only thawed shortly before her death. Penrose became his mother's biographer (his book, The Lives Of Lee Miller, inspired the recent biopic); he and his daughter Ami Bouhassane are now custodians of Miller's archives and also guides at Farleys House, where visitors can see artworks by Miller and her life-long friends (such as Man Ray and Picasso), contemporary art exhibitions, and some of Miller's personal effects – including the bespoke knuckledusters she carried during the war.

5cc176f9aa18,Riders to Tackle!: Why Britain loved Jilly Cooper's raunchy books,,"Getty Images Cooper's books have been bestsellers since the 1980s (Credit: Getty Images) Daisy Buchanan , author of books including Insatiable and Limelight, host of the You're Booked podcast and Jilly Cooper superfan, first discovered the writer as a teenager. ""I think I was about 13 when I fell in love with Jilly's books,"" she tells BBC Culture. ""Riders and Rivals were being passed around at school, almost 20 years after they were first published, which is a testament to her power. Her stories are dramatic, extravagant, escapist tales – but while she sets her books in glamorous worlds, her characters are so vulnerable, loveable and human. It's only in Jilly-land where you get heroines who triumph while feeling self-conscious about their spots."" As it had for millions of readers before her, the sex left a lasting impression, too. ""She was the first writer I read who talked openly about women seeking pleasure,"" says Buchanan. ""She's not the first writer to write about sex, but I think she's one of the first to show sex on the page that is tender, joyful and loving – and to say that you don't need to be perfect to seek those sexual experiences. In her stories, sex is sometimes Earth-shatteringly profound, and sometimes simply fun."" Escapist and educational? This positive attitude to sex was a huge influence when Buchanan started writing her own novels. ""My first novel, Insatiable, wouldn't exist if it wasn't for Jilly Cooper's novels,"" she says. ""Jilly's books formed my emotional sex education, and Insatiable… owes an enormous debt to Rivals and Riders. I wanted to write escapist sex with real emotions."" But while there is much to celebrate in Cooper's portrayals of sex, it wasn't always fun – or consensual. ""There are rapes that happen in Jilly's books, and it is very rare that the rapist has any kind of comeuppance,"" says Burge. In one particularly disturbing scene in Riders, Rupert coerces his wife Helen into a sexual act. ""It's a really horrible scene,"" says Burge. ""Those aspects are difficult to read now.""",https://www.bbc.com/culture/article/20231109-riders-to-tackle-the-raunchy-books-britain-loves,Culture,BBC,,https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/624x351/p0grs2jt.jpg,2025-10-06T13:15:00+00:00,81fd2a51a79513712c3811b24dd18ff2d60609f0
69028c2b899e,'You cannot kill a legend with science': The century-long search for the Loch Ness Monster,,"The most famous image appeared in 1934 at the height of Nessie-mania: a slender, serpent-like neck rising from the loch. For decades, the photo baffled Nessieologists. In 1979, Californian naturalist Dennis Power suggested the ""monster"" it depicted was an elephant swimming with its trunk above water. Elephants, he noted, could swim up to 30 miles. While admitting the idea of an elephant in the Scottish Highlands was almost as unlikely as a real monster, he said: ""We'd love to apply for a government grant for four round-trip tickets to Scotland and 40 tonnes of peanuts to try and trap it, but that's probably out of the question."" While the photo was later exposed as a hoax , the unlikely elephant theory was not forgotten. In 2006, Neil Clark, curator of palaeontology at Glasgow University's Hunterian Museum, suggested that 1930s sightings could have been circus elephants, as fairs visiting nearby Inverness often stopped at Loch Ness to rest animals. ""When their elephants swam in the loch, only the trunk and two humps could be seen – the first hump being the head, the second the back,"" he said. Clark admitted that most sightings of Nessie could be explained by floating logs or waves. However, asked whether he believed in the Loch Ness Monster, Clark said: ""I do believe there is something alive in Loch Ness."" Operation Deepscan may have failed at great expense to capture Nessie, but one less scientific attempt in 1976 achieved similar results at a fraction of the cost. American trombone player Bob Samborski tried to coax Nessie with a mating call on his instrument. He told BBC Radio Highland that if she did emerge, one of two things would happen: ""Either I'll become rich and famous, or if she likes it so much that she eats me alive, at least I'll be famous and somebody else will become rich."" -- For more stories and never-before-published radio scripts to your inbox, sign up to the In History newsletter , while The Essential List delivers a handpicked selection of features and insights twice a week.",https://www.bbc.com/culture/article/20251002-the-century-long-search-for-the-loch-ness-monster,Culture,BBC,,https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/624x351/p0m6dm1y.jpg,2025-10-06T09:58:34.662000+00:00,bd9c3f4436335653bd005e2052c72529ce27b34f
a31980a0c28e,'A force for alienation': How The Social Network predicted the future of tech,,"Zuckerberg may have a point, but it's hardly the first time that a film has twisted the truth for dramatic and thematic purposes. ""As a historian and someone who believes very strongly in media literacy, I always approach and encourage others to approach a film based on real events as still a dramatisation,"" Jason Steinhauer, the author of History, Disrupted: How Social Media and the World Wide Web Have Changed the Past, tells the BBC. ""Every Hollywood film takes liberties, removes elements from the story, heightens the drama, and accentuates certain characters, all in the name of storytelling. I would be hesitant for anyone to make an assumption that the Zuckerberg that was depicted in that film is somehow this very accurate picture of the man himself."" What is striking, though, is the way The Social Network draws a different type of ""accurate picture"" – a picture of certain negative aspects of social media which wouldn't be analysed in depth for years after the film came out. According to its critics, online interaction feeds on insecurity; it can encourage hostility; and it has, as the New York Times put it last year, ""created a recipe for loneliness"". The shots of Zuckerberg sitting motionless in his chair, repeatedly tapping the button to see if Albright has responded, encapsulate social media In 2020, CNBC reported on a Cigna survey that ""found an increasing correlation between social media usage and feelings of loneliness"". And in the words of a 2021 Oxford University philosophy study by Emily Qureshi-Hurst – just one of many recent articles on the subject – ""social media heightens feelings of alienation and estrangement"" in three ways: ""1) social media allows us to construct artificial versions of ourselves through the use of filters and photo editing software; 2) it provides the means to quantify social approval in groups the size of which the human brain has not evolved for; 3) it extends the size of our social networks but decreases the quality of interactions."" In short, it turns us all into callow students, desperate to be popular, however badly that desperation makes us feel. The final scene of The Social Network sums up this state. After betraying his best friend Eduardo and getting his new best friend Sean ousted from Facebook, Zuckerberg sits alone in an office, waiting for Albright to accept his Facebook friend request. The shots of him sitting motionless in his chair, repeatedly tapping the button to see if Albright has responded, are the perfect encapsulation of what social media has done to so many of us.

5e6dffcdbe55,"'His intense, unblinking stare is perfect': The dog-centred horror led by a new canine acting 'superstar'",,"""The idea started as a concept after watching Poltergeist [1982] for probably the 100th time,"" Leonberg tells BBC Culture. ""In the opening of that film, the family's dog clearly senses the presence of the ghost before anyone else. That trope of 'the dog who knows better' appears in so many horror films, and I thought, 'Someone should really tell that story from the dog's perspective.'"" Leonberg didn't have to search far to cast the lead, as Indy is his own dog, who he thought could be perfect due to his ""intense, unblinking stare"". Through expressive head tilts, whimpers and inquisitive stares, Indy certainly takes the audience along with him on the terrifying experience of the discovery of some sort of supernatural force. And, as the human faces in the film are mostly obscured, the viewer also experiences the frustration of a loyal animal trying to warn his owner of trouble, only to be – sometimes cruelly – dismissed. This unusual perspective makes the film surprisingly affecting. Over the course of three years, Leonberg and his wife, Kari Fischer – also a producer on the movie – filmed Indy in a huge variety of situations and scenarios. ""It came down to having the camera ready at the right time in the right place,"" he explains, ""then guiding him with simple cues, noises, gestures, and food into those circumstances, and being ready to capture his instincts rather than impose our expectations on him. ""These [moments] could be edited together to create an illusion of a performance,"" he says. ""On camera, if you cut from his gaze to what he's looking at, the audience instinctively creates the meaning. We often connect the dots when watching horror films and Indy was naturally suited to help the audience do that."" Indy is not the only domestic animal currently winning accolades for their performances in a film.

Last year's A Complete Unknown concentrated on the earliest years of Bob Dylan's career, and now Springsteen: Deliver Me from Nowhere dramatises an even shorter chapter of its subject's life story. As played by Jeremy Allen White ( The Bear ), Bruce Springsteen is shown making just one album, 1982's Nebraska. He is on the verge of superstardom, but he is also having a crisis of confidence. His solution: to retreat to his bedroom in New Jersey with a four-track recorder and an acoustic guitar, to work on a set of songs about blue-collar disappointment. Jeremy Strong (Succession) co-stars as Springsteen's manager, Jon Landau, while Stephen Graham (Adolescence) plays his hard-drinking father in the black-and-white flashbacks to his 1950s childhood. ""If some fans go in expecting the equivalent of a greatest hits package, think again,"" writes Pete Hammond in Deadline . ""Springsteen: Deliver Me from Nowhere is the real deal, an intelligent, deliberately paced journey into the soul of an artist."" Released internationally on 24 October Amazon MGM Studios Hedda Henrik Ibsen's Hedda Gabler was first staged in 1891, but Nia DaCosta ( Candyman , The Marvels) has updated the classic play in more ways than one. The writer-director has moved the action to an English mansion in 1954, where the newly married anti-heroine is throwing a long, lavish and increasingly chaotic party. Two other key changes to the text are that the title character (played by Tessa Thompson) is now a black woman in a predominantly white environment, and her ex-lover is now a woman (Nina Hoss). The most crucial update, though, is that DaCosta has made her adaptation an intensely stylish and sensuous affair, as embodied by its leading lady. It's a ""devilish thrill"" to watch the ""sultry"" Thompson in a film ""full of attitude, energy, and colour"", writes Kristy Puchko in IndieWire . ""Sumptuous, hot, and challenging, this is a drama of love, sex, and regret that burns like a shot of whisky.""

a456e415d7fe,'You can't grasp her or replicate her': Why Anna Magnani is the overlooked 'goddess' of Italian cinema,,"Less than a year earlier, Teresa Gullace, a six-month-pregnant mother of five had been shot in Rome by a Nazi soldier after she waved at her captive husband. In the film, Francesco shouts ""Teresa"", as an homage. At the time, Magnani was also suffering, as her son had contracted polio. An unconventional star Magnani's communication of this raw pain on screen is perhaps one reason why she is less popular in the US today than other iconic Italian actresses. ""Anna is the embodiment of a country that came out of the war with the courage of showing its wounds,"" says De Bernardinis. ""Soon after, Sophia Loren, Gina Lollobrigida and other 'maggiorate' ('busty actresses') represent the Italy that wants to forget the war. Florid, full bodied, flourishing."" Rome, Open City became the highest grossing film in Italy that year, and the first non-American film to earn over $1m in the US. The American press loved it. Magnani, The New York Times wrote, had ""an ability to weep real tears, to laugh real laughter, to brawl fiercely; to be thunderous in anger, lusciously sensual in love"". Tennessee Williams tried to convince Magnani to act in his new play on Broadway – one of the many American offers she refused. ""This woman, Anna Magnani, she sinks the claws in the heart,"" he said. The fact itself that she existed, despite the photogenic standards of the time, despite a tormented biography, is important for a girl who chooses to do my job – Liliana Fiorelli Ingrid Bergman liked Rome, Open City so much that she wrote to Rossellini – adding that the only Italian words she knew were ""Ti amo"". Rossellini, Magnani's partner, kept the exchange secret, until she saw a telegram from Bergman. She lovingly plated some spaghetti, asking Rossellini if he would like some. When he replied yes, she answered: ""Then eat it!"" and threw it all at his face. This episode is recalled by friends and bystanders; the only detail that changes with the telling of the story is what pasta they were eating. In short, Magnani was intimidating.

2abd987a416c,Swinney says 'precedent is on my side' to secure indyref2,,"Swinney says 'precedent is on my side' to secure indyref2 James Delaney BBC Scotland First Minister John Swinney told BBC's The Sunday Show that ""precedent is on my side"" when it comes to indyref2 John Swinney said the precedent set ahead of the 2014 Scottish independence referendum should trigger a new poll, if the party wins a majority at the next Holyrood election. The SNP gained more than half of MSPs in 2011, an electoral triumph that paved the way for a vote on the country's future. On Saturday delegates at the party's conference in Aberdeen backed his strategy ahead of a bid to make the next election a de-facto poll on independence. But Scottish Secretary Douglas Alexander said the UK Labour government, which would have to approve the move, does not support a second referendum. Sir Keir Starmer previously said he had no plans to allow a fresh poll to take place during his term as prime minister. But Swinney told BBC Scotland's The Sunday Show that the prime minister's position was ""fatuous"" due to the ""clearly established basis"" set out after the SNP's historic win 14 years ago. He added: ""Precedent is on my side. ""This is what happened in 2011. ""And precedent is a substantial factor in legal consideration of the right of the people of Scotland to decide their own future."" The SNP leader said that result meant his party was in a ""much stronger position"" to negotiate a mandate for a new vote should they achieve a majority next year. Asked if the election should instead be fought on current issues, such as standards of living, Swinney replied: ""I would say to people worried about their standard of living, this election should be about independence. ""Because, under the United Kingdom, people's standard of living has been flat as a pancake for 15 years."" The first minister said Scotland had to consider if was going to accept ""more of this"" as well as what he described as a ""shift to the right"" in UK politics. He said the SNP was bringing down NHS waiting lists and building more affordable homes. Swinney added: ""Self-government works for the people of Scotland and if we want to improve living standards, let's have the choice of independence."" PA Media Former First Minister Nicola Sturgeon signed copies of her memoir at the conference Former First Minister Nicola Sturgeon backed Swinney's strategy as she signed copies of her new memoir at the conference. Sturgeon, who will step down as an MSP next year, said achieving a majority was an ""exceptionally hard task"". But she added: ""If you don't set your sights high, you don't deliver big things."" In the 2011 election , the SNP – then led by the late Alex Salmond – won 69 of 129 available seats. The party has failed to gain an outright majority in two Holyrood elections since then. Salmond and the then Conservative Prime Minister David Cameron signed the Edinburgh Agreement in October 2012. It set out the terms for the 2014 ballot under Section 30 of the Scotland Act 1998. Scotland voted against leaving the UK by a margin of 55.3% to 44.7% in September 2014. Any new vote would require Starmer to grant similar assent. Scottish Secretary Douglas Alexander told The Sunday Show that he had ""heard all of this before” from Swinney regarding indyref2 Also appearing on the Sunday Show, Alexander said Swinney was using independence to divert attention away from the SNP's ""horrific"" record on public services. He said he was not sure if he had been listening to ""the Grand Old Duke of York or the first minister of Scotland"". Alexander added: ""This is all about marching his troops in that hall up to the top of the hill and then back down again. ""We have heard all of this before."" Asked if the UK government would say no to a second independence referendum, the Labour MP for Lothian East said he was ""working for victory"" at the Holyrood election in 2026 and ""not anticipating defeat"". Alexander told The Sunday Show: ""I am not going to divulge in his game which is to divert attention from his horrifically bad record on Scotland's public services by trying instead to provoke an argument about the constitution."" The Scottish Secretary, who replaced Ian Murray last month , was also questioned about whether he had a ""duty to the electorate"" to outline what would happen in the event of an SNP majority. He replied: ""I was elected on a very clear manifesto in July of 2024 which said Labour does not support independence or another referendum. ""That's the mandate on which I was elected and I will adhere to that mandate."" John Swinney has hinted that he has some tactics in mind to force the issue of a referendum, should the SNP win big next year. He might have given one of them away by talking about the legal importance of precedent. One speaker at the conference yesterday raised the prospect of a judicial review - should UK ministers reject calls for a vote - and was then name-checked by Swinney on stage. Could fresh court action be on the first minister's mind? The example of 2011 may provide a political precedent - but is there a legal one? After all, the Supreme Court has already issued a ruling that UK ministers must consent to a binding referendum. We are of course getting way ahead of the game. There is still an election to be fought, and a Holyrood majority is a hard thing to secure. But some in the SNP are already thinking even further ahead. Indeed it has been suggested that Sir Keir Starmer's refusal might be moot as, if results go against him in Scotland and Wales, then he may well be out on his ear and they'll be negotiating with someone else. Scottish Conservative deputy leader Rachael Hamilton accused the first minister of ""desperately pushing his obsession with independence"" to divert attention from ""the SNP's failures in government"". She added: ""Swinney, as usual, is putting party before country, by fixating on breaking up the UK, rather than fixing the damage done to our NHS, schools, jobs and economic growth by his government."" Liberal Democrat MSP Willie Rennie said the first minister was using the ""crutch of independence"" in a bid to to restore the party's fortunes.

c001de244842,Greater Anglia transfers to public ownership,,"Greater Anglia transfers to public ownership Greater Anglia Greater Anglia runs the key commuter service between Norwich and London Liverpool Street Greater Anglia has become the latest rail operator to enter into public ownership as part of the government's renationalisation of the network. The company runs trains from Cambridge, Ipswich, Norwich and Colchester to London, as well as Stansted Airport, Peterborough, Hertford and smaller lines. Its transfer on Sunday means half of all rail operators are publicly owned, which Greater Anglia described as another step towards a ""more unified"" network of Great British Railways. ""Passengers commuting into Norwich or heading for a day out in Cambridge will be travelling on services that are owned by the public, and run with their interests front of mind,"" said Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander. ""We're reforming a fragmented system and laying the foundations for a more reliable, efficient and accountable railway - one that puts passengers first and delivers the high standards they rightly expect."" Martin Giles/BBC Heidi Alexander visited Norwich railway station last week, ahead of the transfer Last week Greater Anglia, which handled 81.8 million passenger journeys in 2024-25, was named Rail Operator of the Year at the National Transport Awards. The Department for Transport (DfT) said the company, with government support, would continue to deliver regional growth. Two new stations are opening — Beaulieu Park in north Chelmsford this month and Cambridge South early next year — and the operator has a new fleet of bi-mode trains. Martin Giles/BBC Greater Anglia will eventually become part of Great British Railways Greater Anglia's managing director Martin Beable said the move was an ""exciting opportunity"" to build on its success. ""By working more closely with the wider family of publicly owned operators, we can share expertise, drive innovation, and deliver even better journeys for our passengers across the Anglia region,"" he added. ""This transition also brings us one step closer to Great British Railways - a simpler, more unified network that puts passengers at its heart. ""Together, we can create a railway that drives growth, sustainability, and pride for the communities we serve and right across the UK."" Greater Anglia joins c2c, Northern, TransPennine Express, Southeastern, LNER and South Western Railway, which are currently operated by DfT Operator Limited (DFTO) on behalf of the government. West Midlands Trains services will transfer back to the state on 1 February, followed by Govia Thameslink Railway (GTR) on 31 May, with Chiltern Railways and Great Western Railways services expected to follow, the DfT said.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c36kg2lzjgno,Society,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/5d69/live/d6890e90-a73f-11f0-bcd6-45a56ab59606.jpg,2025-10-12T03:46:40.189000+00:00,f1e509a0c70edc6cab1ab92f1c844ea230379b72
b9d815fa1769,I was shocked when mum told me what she wants to do with her body when she dies,,"I was shocked when mum told me what she wants to do with her body when she dies Lucy Owen Reporter, Inside The World of Body Donors Lucy Owen Mum and I are super close, so when she told me she wanted to donate her body to education I wanted to know more about why Talking about death with your parents is a conversation everyone dreads, but my mum Patsy wanted that chat with me – and learning what she wants to happen to her body after she's gone came as a shock. Even in the darkest hours when she had bowel cancer a few years ago, I tried to avoid thinking about what it would mean to actually lose mum. But, at 86, she sat me down to tell me she wants to donate her body to medical science after she dies. Mum is certain she wants to be one of the 1,300 UK people every year whose bodies are donated to education as she feels without donors, the doctors of tomorrow won't get the experience they need. When mum told me she'd been already in touch with a university and everything was arranged, I was torn between admiration and confusion. If I'm honest, body donation just wasn't on my radar and I had loads of questions running around in my head. How would her body be used? Would we be able to have a funeral? But Patsy Cohen is nothing if not determined and pragmatic. ""I imagine a great big saw will come out and they'll chop off a leg, but I don't really mind,"" she told me in her own inimitable way. Here's a picture of my son Gabs, mum and me and I can tell you mum is still living life to the full, whether it's walking the dog or playing bridge and have a glass of wine with friends Mum wants to donate her body to show her gratitude to medical professionals as they helped her when she had bowel cancer and needed surgery four years ago. She wants to help the medics of the future and told me: ""I wouldn't be here if it wasn't for them, so this is a simple way to give back."" As a journalist and inquisitive daughter, I naturally wanted to find out for myself more about what mum was planning to do. So I made a documentary at a university that teaches using real human bodies - and the one where mum will go. Our cameras were given rare access behind the scenes at Cardiff University to see what happens to our donated bodies. We saw how students ""developed a connection"" with their donors and their relationship with the families left behind. The anatomy centre is where medical students learn from real bodies rather than from textbooks in lecture theatres. ""There really is no substitute for being able to see, touch and feel real anatomy,"" said Dr Hannah Shaw, who leads the anatomy education team. King Charles is among the people I have met in my 18 years working as a BBC journalist in Cardiff, presenting the evening news programme Wales Today Just as our bodies are different on the outside, she said physiology and conditions such as cancer or hip replacements make us different on the inside, too. ""Textbooks give you the impression that everything is the same and we're not,"" she added. However, the use of real bodies in anatomy education is falling as advances in technology mean human bodies can be replicated in 3D on screens. Angela Gillson Freya (pictured here with her parents) is among the hundreds of medical students who joined Cardiff University last year But Dr Shaw feels the real thing provides the best education for students like Freya Gillson. ""Things in real life look completely different to how you think they would look,"" said the 19-year-old Cardiff University medical student. ""So working with donors is incredible. They are our very first patients and you do develop a connection with them - they're our silent teachers."" When someone who has pledged their body to Cardiff University dies, they are brought to the anatomy centre as quickly as possible. The bodies are preserved and, if donors consented, some parts are removed and retained for further teaching. Donors can remain in the centre for up to three years. When the time comes for the bodies to leave the anatomy centre, the university places them into coffins for a funeral director to collect. Their families then get to decide if they want to cremate or bury them, with the funeral costs covered by the university. Carol Endersby Joy Sesay (centre) was 95 when she died in a care home near London in 2024 but she wanted her body donated to Cardiff University as she'd lived in the Welsh capital for 30 years So it can be a long wait for families as they grieve their loved ones, something the family of Joy Sesay had to adjust to. ""Her whole ethos was about helping people who were less fortunate than yourself - and being a good person,"" daughter Jenny told me. With eight children, 20 grandchildren, 23 great-grandchildren and three great-great-grandchildren, Joy left behind a very large family who held memorial services while waiting for the cremation. Although some felt they'd had closure, granddaughter AJ admitted feeling ""in limbo"" without a funeral. ""It's kind of been a bit strange because it hasn't been your usual, go to the funeral and then you deal with it,"" she said. Inquiry rates from people wanting to donate have been lower in the UK in recent years and Cardiff has seen a fall, with about 50% fewer people registering since 2020. Although 154 people still signed up in 2024. Not everyone can donate their body to science and for those that do consider it, universities ""strongly recommend"" they should tell their families. Some 1,200 students and 800 professionals, including dentists, midwives and surgeons, learn on body donors every year at Cardiff At the end of the academic year, I went to the annual memorial event held by the university where families and students meet each other. The students don't say who they've worked with but it's a chance for them to share what they've learned more generally. ""Seeing the pictures of our donors with their families, it made it all very real,"" Freya said about that ""poignant moment"". ""Everybody takes a step back and realises that this journey's come to an end."" For Joy's family, it's just the beginning. ""You think it might be a one-off gift of your body and you close the book, that's not the case,"" daughter Carol said. ""The fact is you open the book and the good that her body will do, not just for future doctors, but for future patients... we just didn't realise the enormity and importance of what she did."" Patsy Cohen The image on the left is mum in her work uniform as an air hostess for BOAC while on the right she's with my dad Jeff at a party in the 1960s It'll be an unimaginable wrench when we do have to say that last goodbye to mum, but I'm so glad I know and understand her wishes. In typical Patsy style she told me: ""I feel when I'm not here, I'm not going to be wasted, it's going to do some good and help make a better doctor."" It will give me real comfort to know that she is continuing to make a difference and that makes me enormously proud of her. Hopefully it'll be many years before I hand mum over to the care of Cardiff University's anatomy centre - and I'm delighted to report that Patsy is not going gently and is still living life to the full. This journey has also led me to the decision to donate my body to the centre when I die, too.

West Yorkshire Police said two men aged 25 and 43 had been arrested on suspicion of murder. The disgraced rock star from Pontypridd was serving a 29-year sentence at HMP Wakefield for child sex offences. Watkins, 48, was jailed in December 2013 for a string of child sex offences, including the attempted rape of a baby. Police said they were called to the prison on Saturday morning to reports of a serious assault on a prisoner, who was pronounced dead at the scene. A Prison Service spokesperson said it was aware of an incident at the prison but was ""unable to comment further while the police investigate"". Watkins was sentenced to 29 years in prison with a further six years on licence, and his two co-defendants, the mothers of children he abused, were jailed for 14 and 17 years. He was previously attacked in prison in August 2023 , but his injuries were not life threatening. The attack at Wakefield Prison comes less than two weeks after a report into the facility was published that found violence there had ""increased markedly"". The report from the chief inspector of prisons said: ""Many prisoners told us they felt unsafe, particularly older men convicted of sexual offences who increasingly shared the prison with a growing cohort of younger prisoners."" Police were called to Wakefield Prison on Saturday morning Watkins admitted the attempted rape and sexual assault of a child under 13 but pleaded not guilty to rape. He also admitted conspiring to rape a child, three counts of sexual assault involving children, seven involving taking, making or possessing indecent images of children and one of possessing an extreme pornographic image involving a sex act on an animal. Judges rejected an appeal by Watkins in 2014 to reduce the length of his jail term. During sentencing, Mr Justice Royce said the case broke ""new ground"" and ""plunged into new depths of depravity"". ""Any decent person... will experience shock, revulsion and incredulity."" The judge said Watkins had a ""corrupting influence"", and had shown a ""complete lack of remorse"". Who was Ian Watkins? Getty Images Watkins performing in London a few months before his arrest in 2012 His trial heard Watkins had used his fame to manipulate and control others, often under the influence of hard drugs, including crystal meth.

In a statement, the leaders of the UK, France and Germany said the joint action would ""increase pressure"" on Russian President Vladimir Putin and ""bring Russia to the negotiation table"". It added the move would be taken ""in close cooperation"" with the US. UK sanctions have frozen more than £25bn of Russian assets since Moscow launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022. But until now, funds sent to Ukraine using Russian assets had only been taken from profits and interest accrued on them. Sir Keir told Ukrainian President Volodymr Zelensky that the UK, France and Germany were ""united in wanting to drive progress towards using the full value of the immobilised Russian sovereign assets to end the war"". He added that more sanctions ""in the coming days and weeks"" would add further pressure on Moscow. The announcement comes after European leaders met in Copenhagen last week to discuss using frozen Russian assets for a €140bn ($162bn; £121bn) loan to Ukraine. Last month, US President Donald Trump called on G7 allies to seize ""or otherwise use"" frozen Russian assets, according to the Financial Times.

1b20b7b034ab,"Cold, flu, Covid: Why is everyone sick right now?",,"Cold, flu, Covid: Why is everyone sick right now? Nick Triggle Health correspondent iStock/Getty Images Are you ill? If not, you probably know someone who is - or at the very least someone who has just recovered. Coughs and colds, it seems, are rampant at the moment. And, if the anecdotes of people I know are anything to go by, the bug going round seems to be a particularly nasty one. Sore throat? Tick. Streaming nose? Tick. Sinus pressure? Double tick. What's going on? The perfect breeding ground ""This is normal, it's autumn after all,"" says Prof Jonathan Ball, from Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine. He says a combination of children returning to school, adults back at work after the summer break and people spending more time indoors as the weather turns cooler creates a ripe breeding ground for respiratory viruses to flourish. ""Basically we have a big mixing pot of different viruses that are beginning to do the rounds. Immunity has waned and people are getting ill."" There are actually more than 100 different viruses that cause upper and lower respiratory tract infections, plus some bacterial infections. Is there more illness than normal? Data collection from the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) shows Rhinovirus – what many of us would call the common cold – has been on the increase in recent weeks and seems to be the most common cause of illness at the moment. Covid is also doing the rounds, driven by two new variants – XFG, called Stratus by some, and NB.1.8.1, known as Nimbus. But there is already a high degree of immunity built up in the population meaning, for most, it's a fairly mild infection. There are signs flu may be on the rise too – there has been an increase in the 15-25 age group over the past week - while RSV, which can cause serious illness in young children, also tends to take off in the autumn. ""There is often, although not always, a pattern,"" says Dr Jamie Lopez Bernal, a consultant epidemiologist at UKHSA. ""You tend to see Rhinovirus take off first and then RSV,"" he explains. ""Flu tends to come later in December and January. But that's not always the case – and certainly the pandemic disrupted the traditional seasonal trends. What we've seen in the last year or so is those trends return to something like normal."" He says the levels of illnesses at the moment are not particularly high. ""Covid is above baseline and there's a lot of Rhinovirus around. The uptick in flu in that younger age group has perhaps come a little bit earlier than we would expect, but it is still at a low level."" Is it a cold, flu or Covid? The most common symptoms, according to the NHS, are: Colds Symptoms appear gradually Mostly affect nose and throat Early sign - pressure in your ears Chestier, mucus cough Flu Comes on suddenly Feel wiped out Fever, muscle aches, exhaustion Need bed rest Dry cough Covid Typical flu symptoms Loss of taste of smell Diarrhoea or tummy upset Many of the symptoms between cold, flu and more serious viruses like Covid overlap. How can you protect yourself? Respiratory infections can, of course, be really dangerous for vulnerable people - in a bad winter tens of thousands of people can die of flu. But there is nothing to suggest the respiratory viruses circulating now are causing more serious illness this year in otherwise healthy people. ""We all react in different ways – and we don't really understand why,"" admits Prof Ball. ""Of course, age and fitness have a lot to do with it, but sometimes it is just your individual genetics or how tired and rundown you may be, or when you were last exposed to that particular virus."" In terms of protecting yourself, the most important step to take, if you are eligible, is to get vaccinatinated. Shots are being offered for flu, Covid and RSV to protect those who are most at-risk of serious illness, which includes older people and those with certain health conditions. If you are ill, UKHSA says you can help protect others by washing your hands regularly, especially after coughing or sneezing, staying at home if you can and consider wearing a mask if you do have to go into public places. Prof Ball says it is right to take precautions to try to protect vulnerable people, but adds if you are healthy and young or of working age, getting the odd respiratory illness is pretty inevitable and not necessarily a bad thing. ""Most people will get one or two respiratory infections every year. In some ways, it's a good thing when you are a child or healthy adult. ""By getting exposed you are building up your immunity through natural infection - so when you are older you hopefully have enough immunity to not get severely ill.""",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c1jz608l9l4o,Society,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/d262/live/c2050750-a6bb-11f0-a356-d3fc7522eb5a.jpg,2025-10-11T23:07:17.027000+00:00,c20dcff6a2ef0bf3a1bd7d05ceaefab806d6397f
1b27a2a115cd,I asked AI to plan my dream summer holiday. Here's how it turned out,,"I asked AI to plan my dream summer holiday. Here's how it turned out Alan Smith Alan Smith with his wife and their daughter's boyfriend on the pier at Castro Urdiales The gothic arches of Santa María de la Asunción crown the hill above the stone harbour where fishermen land their catches of sardines and anchovies. The church in Castro Urdiales, a small seaside town of about 30,000 people in northern Spain, is more than 700 years old. It was the perfect holiday destination for Alan Smith and his family, though he had never heard of it - until he asked ChatGPT. This week a report from the travel association ABTA found an increasing number of people were turning to AI to help with their holidays , from suggesting destinations to planning itineraries once there. Alan and his wife drove from their home in Kent to northern Spain with their caravan last month, where they met their daughter and her boyfriend. Alan had asked ChatGPT to recommend places in the area they could visit and requested the drives between them should not be too long. Castro Urdiales was one of the places suggested by the AI chatbot. ""It was the highlight of the holiday,"" Alan says, ""it was buzzing, like a smaller version of San Sebastián. Tim Graham/Getty Images The church of Santa María de la Asunción overlooks the fishing harbour of Castro Urdiales ""It had all the pintxos you could want, but it's smaller and has far fewer foreign tourists."" Alan is 62. According to the ABTA report, 3% of tourists his age use AI in some way to help with their holiday. The average for the whole population is 8% and use is highest among those aged 25-34, at 18%. After the AI chatbot made suggestions to Alan about places to visit and routes to take, he checked them on Google to make sure they were legitimate. He made all the bookings himself though, as he was not sure sure about ChatGPT's ability to do this - particularly given the sums of money involved. Alan began using the AI-powered tool shortly after it was released in November 2022 and uses it frequently for all sorts of things, from finding information about places he's visiting to recipes he wants to cook. He often turns to it instead of search engines to save time, rather than reading through several web pages such as travel blogs about good places to visit in northern Spain. ""I've been stunned at the results,"" Alan says. ""It's not always right though, and can - occasionally - be spectacularly wrong."" Alan Smith Alan says AI really helped when planning his family's caravan trip to Spain Hannah Read, 37, tried to use an AI chatbot to plan a trip to Norway with her partner and three children. She wanted to drive from her home in Flintshire, north Wales and cross the North Sea by ferry. ""I thought it might make for a nice drive,"" Hannah says. ""I asked ChatGPT if there was a ferry from the UK to Norway and it said there was one from Newcastle to Bergen."" She later checked a ferry travel website but found no such route exists. A travel blog detailing how Brits can reach Norway says the last time the route operated was in 2008. ""I did feel a bit disappointed when I found out the information on ChatGPT was incorrect, as I'd got quite excited and had started planning the trip in my head,"" Hannah adds. ""My advice is don't rely on AI 100%, it's better to still do proper research."" On ChatGPT's search section it reminds users to check important information as ChatGPT can make mistakes. David Harris David Harris and his family on Top of the Rock at the Rockefeller Center in New York David Harris, 46, used AI to help plan the itinerary for his family's first holiday in New York, but was more trusting about its recommendations. Unlike Alan, David knew where he wanted to go - and exactly how he was going to get there, unlike Hannah. But he wasn't sure how much he could fit into a trip of just four-and-a-half days, so he turned to an AI-powered tool for help. David asked it to suggest attractions to see and activities to do in the time they had - and asked for them to be grouped together by location so that he and his young family could walk between each. ""With four of us going we kind of wanted to see everything,"" David says, ""from Taylor Swift's house to the Ghostbusters museum."" Having used ChatGPT extensively for work and knowing attractions in New York tend to stay open quite late, he didn't feel the need to check the opening times and walking directions suggested by the AI chatbot. ""It took a couple of prompts to refine the itinerary - as it gave me a lot of information I didn't need to begin with - but it ended up producing a really good list of things to do."" David admits it hadn't even occurred to him to ask it to suggest possible flights with cheaper prices, but says he will try that for a holiday he is planning to the Mediterranean next year. David Harris The first day of the itinerary suggested to David by ChatGPT He adds: ""I think AI tools would help people so much if they understood how to use them and gave it a go."" They certainly have their place in holiday planning but users should understand how they work as well as check the recommendations they make, says Alistair Berry, a moderator on the UK Travel subreddit, an online forum where people can ask for advice about travel options in the UK. ""Sometimes these chatbots provide really poor advice,"" Alistair says. ""We get a lot of Americans, who get relatively few vacation days, on our site and they have these AI-made itineraries. ""ChatGPT has convinced them they can see London, Edinburgh and the Cotswolds in just four days and still have a good time. The reality is that they will probably spend most of the time looking out from inside a train."" He says people planning holidays with AI tools should understand their programming often makes them encouraging and affirming of the user's demands and requests. ""It definitely has a place in travel planning but you should fact check the suggestions it makes,"" says Alistair. ""After all, you don't want to be caught out when you're supposed to be having a relaxing time on holiday.""",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cp8w6kn2dyzo,Society,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/9e33/live/5b660dd0-a6bd-11f0-a5ba-c17536b4c2c1.jpg,2025-10-11T23:06:46.899000+00:00,1a4f92f36bcc4bb0ac84c60e18a58158bcdc5a9c
294c5bcd12a6,Why Labour's deputy leadership race could be a verdict on Starmer,,"Why Labour's deputy leadership race could be a verdict on Starmer Laura Kuenssberg Presenter, Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg BBC Of the 18 politicians to have been Labour's deputy leader, one has a dim view of the job. ""Really ghastly,"" says Dame Margaret Beckett, who was number two under John Smith in the 1990s. She reckons it was a thankless task - important, but frankly, a bit dull. Well, it's not boring right now. Labour is in a mess, and the party has to choose a new deputy who might be part of Sir Keir Starmer's salvation or, if it goes wrong, make a bad situation even worse. So what's the job, who wants it, and what might happen next? ""It's a bit of a funny, vague role,"" one party insider says. There isn't a precise job description. Technically, the deputy leader has a seat on Labour's obscure but incredibly powerful National Executive Committee. They attend what's known as political cabinet, not the weekly meeting of ministers, but the less frequent get together of the prime minister's top team where the civil servants are booted out of the room, and the party people come in. The deputy also attends the weekly party parliamentary meeting, along with the prime minister, some elected backbenchers and the leader of the House. The deputy leader is not automatically the deputy prime minister - the official government understudy - and won't be this time. That job was given to David Lammy when he was moved sideways from being foreign secretary. Another source says the deputy is the ""campaigner in chief"" - it's a huge opportunity, but also, with Labour facing a very tricky set of elections in May, it's a tough prospect. Leaders cannot just tell their number two to pipe down, because they are voted in by party members. That quandary is at the root of the contest this time round. Reuters Angela Rayner quit as Labour's deputy leader in September The two candidates, on paper, have a lot in common. Lucy Powell and Bridget Phillipson are both straight talking politicians from the north of England. Neither are from the strident far left of the Labour movement, nor ardent members of the New Labour fan tribe. Although, as a party source suggests, Powell has played it ""one step to the left of Bridget"" through the last few weeks. They have both held senior positions and are well known in the party. Among the public there's not much in it either. One recent survey by YouGov suggested 31% of people have heard of Phillipson, while 36% said they knew of Powell. Both are far less well known than the woman they seek to replace, Angela Rayner (84%) who resigned after failing to pay enough tax on her £800,000 flat in Hove, East Sussex , breaching the ministerial code. What's the campaign really about, then? Phillipson and Powell's pitches Well the big difference is that Phillipson is in Starmer's cabinet - and Powell was sacked from it a few weeks ago ( she claims Starmer gave her no reason why other than to ""make way"" for someone else). Powell has made clear during the campaign that she will speak her mind when things are going wrong, arguing that the government needs a ""course correction"" to avoid more political mistakes like the handling of winter fuel allowance . Her backers argue the party will be stronger if it is brave enough to open up debate to more people because, frankly, the clique around Starmer - as many within the party see it - has made plenty of mistakes. PA Wire Lucy Powell has been unafraid to speak her mind during the campaign One source said members had found it ""offensive"" to be told by senior figures in the party that ""only someone on the prime minister's good behaviour list"" should be considered for the job. The source said the deputy should be the ""yin to the yang"" of No 10. In this best-case scenario, the deputy has their finger firmly on the pulse of the party - so if ministers decide on a plan that members and MPs are likely to dislike, the deputy can put the brakes on. If their opinion is taken into consideration, that is. Phillipson's team argue a big voice like this outside the cabinet would create a rival power base that could destabilise what is an already shaky political operation. Picture the scene - the government decides it really has to crack on with some welfare cuts after all and ministers announce them. The deputy gives an interview and sounds not entirely convinced. MPs then have licence to protest and complain. Downing Street's plans look wobbly, and with several of the prime minister's big ideas having already been ditched, you know what happens next. Phillipson's pitch is that she would argue for members' desires , particularly to help kids who grow up in poverty, and make that case firmly but quietly on the inside, without becoming a lightning rod for dissent. And then on the outside, her team say she would take on more of the job of persuading the public the government is getting things done. Phillipson will on Sunday promise members more power over decision-making, pledging that rather than just talking to their own MP at constituency meetings, she would formally ask members and unions for their views every three months - whether using a new app or through the existing party website. She's also vowing that ministers would hold direct meetings with party members online, and to change the rules around how the party makes policy. Reuters Bridget Phillipson has made various promises to change the party's apparatus For example, when Ed Miliband was leader, Labour opened up the National Policy Forum (NPF) - the party's official machine for making plans - to outside organisations. Ever since, charities, campaign groups and even big companies such as Primark and Vodafone have been able to submit their ideas to it. I'm told Phillipson is pledging to change the rules so only members or organisations with official links to the party could put forward their ideas to the NPF for official consideration. In practical terms, Labour leaders make the final decisions, but how the party is structured matters a lot too - particularly to members. So who is on course to win? A likely candidate - but room for surprise Shock horror in a political campaign, you'll be amazed that the two women have both been caricatured. Powell is not a wild rebel intent on causing havoc (she was in the cabinet until a few weeks ago), nor is Phillipson an automaton trapped in the limits of agreed government lines (it's not so long ago she was the target of negative briefings herself). You'll be staggered too, not really, to learn there's been a bit of backchat between the two sides: Phillipson's allies accusing Powell of not being willing to take part in TV hustings; Powell's allies saying that's nonsense. Phillipson claiming Powell would be ""divisive""; Powell hitting back on Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg last weekend to say that is ""ridiculous"". Getty Images The outcome of the deputy leader contest could prove awkward for Starmer Both have been campaigning across the country, taking part in at least 20 in-person and online events with members. Phillipson has more MPs, and more of the unions on her side. Powell has more constituency party backing, and more from the other affiliated organisations like the Society of Labour Lawyers. The decision for the party is in part whether it wants a politician who will represent members' voices from outside the top echelons of government, or perhaps more discreetly, from the inside. Whoever wins, relationships and personalities will shape what happens. Beyond the official duties, the role of deputy leader has been done in very different ways - by very different characters - in recent history. A steady, loyal hand to help out a busy leader, shaking hands and scoffing sandwiches at party events the prime minister simply doesn't have the time to attend, and doing vital campaign grunt work, as Dame Margaret suggests. Or a pressure valve for a leader that sometimes winds up the rank and file. Think of John Prescott's booming tones that connected with some voters and party members who didn't much like Tony Blair's silken schmooze. Or a deputy who grapples to represent the parliamentary party in bitter opposition to the wilder elements of the leader's tribe. Think of the battles between Tom Watson and Jeremy Corbyn during the party's most recent civil war. This time round, without radical differences between the two candidates, the contest is a chance for members to give a verdict on the leadership, and vent frustration. The truth is that many members, just like Labour MPs, are disgruntled and disappointed by some of the decisions Starmer and his team have made. Some are dismayed by the party's dismal position in the polls, not even 18 months since an enormous election victory. That's why, as things stand, most Labour sources and the limited polling available put Powell as the favourite to win the job. Even a member of the cabinet said to me earlier this week, ""we all know it's going to be Lucy"". We all know by now that politics has an endless capacity to surprise, and the votes haven't all been cast. Phillipson will join us in the studio tomorrow where she'll argue her case, after Powell appeared last week. But if party members do express their frustration by electing Powell, the optics for Starmer would be awkward. One source suggested: ""For Lucy to get sacked then five weeks later, show to be the party's favourite slam-dunk candidate, feeds into the narrative of Keir's non-Midas touch – oops."" It may not be ""ghastly"", but it does seem a decision that Labour members are ready to take.

0e40ac0ccdb0,Can Scotland rouse themselves for World Cup finale?,,"Over the course of the past two games, there's been an alarming lack of influence from many of Clarke's go-to players. Robertson looked off the pace; John McGinn was out of sorts; McTominay, despite his goal, looked a pale imitation of last season when tearing it up in Italy. Adams was impressive and Ben Gannon-Doak threatened to be. He's still a teenager whose pace and ability to ghost past defenders is second nature to him. What he does after that is the bit he must learn. The thinking game. Decision-making. Gannon-Doak puts himself in good positions but too often wastes his own good work with hurried deliveries that are easily dealt with. He'll get there. He's too talented not to. Clarke said he has a lot to mull over, which he does. He said that when it ""comes to the crunch we'll be ready"". The crunch is next month with a visit to Greece and a home game against Denmark that will conclude the group. Scotland's readiness is now a matter of serious debate. Those games will be extraordinarily anxious. The group table, they say, doesn't lie, but it really does. It's one giant porky pie. Scotland are lucky to be sitting in such a fantastic position. They were fortunate to beat Greece and you could say the same about Belarus on Sunday. They survived and it was a blessing, but unless they find their best stuff in the month ahead then this campaign is going to have a grim ending. Clarke and his players know this better than anybody. If they were impressive on Sunday it was in the way they spoke rather than in the way they played. They didn't shirk it. They know that you don't get to a World Cup on luck alone.

Abbie's daughter Lyndee died in June 2023 of an accidental death after an incident at her home in Llanelli, Carmarthenshire. On 21 August of this year, crews were called to a fire in the roof of the house at Brohawddgar. The 43-year-old mother-of-eight said the family have not been in the house due to its unsafe condition and it's having a ""big impact"" on them. Mid and West Wales Fire and Rescue Service Both properties suffered significant damage in the fire Abbie, who has multiple sclerosis (MS), said the family planned to go to Tŷ Hafan, which supports people with life-limiting conditions, for the day. Within an hour of being there, Abbie said they received a call that their house had ""caught fire"" and, she said, ""everything just went blur"". Due to the Llanelli home being council-owned, the family were relocated to a temporary home in Carmarthen, more than 20 miles away, where they are currently living. ""It's basically gutted out,"" Abbie said. Abbie says they had 'quite a large donation' that they are 'still going through' Twins Keira and Sienna, 16, were collecting their GCSE results when they found out about the fire. Kiera described longing for precious items, including those belonging to her little sister, Lyndee. ""I lost a load of stuff of my baby sister. I had a picture frame with her thumb print on it with everyone else's,"" she said. ""Obviously, you can't get that back because of the thumb print.""

3b1226e41fce,Trump says he may send Ukraine long-range Tomahawk missiles if Russia continues conflict,"donald trump news, long-range missiles, russia, tomahawk missiles, ukraine, politics","ABOARD AIR FORCE ONE (AP) — President Donald Trump on Sunday warned Russia that he may send Ukraine long-range Tomahawk missiles if Moscow doesn’t settle its war there soon — suggesting that he could be ready to increase the pressure on Vladimir Putin’s government using a key weapons system. “I might say, ’Look: if this war is not going to get settled, I’m going to send them Tomahawks,” Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One as he flew to Israel. “The Tomahawk is an incredible weapon, very offensive weapon. And honestly, Russia does not need that.” Trump said, “I might tell them that if the war is not settled — that we may very well.” He added, “We may not, but we may do it. I think it’s appropriate to bring up.” READ MORE: Russia targets Ukraine’s power grid as Moscow expresses ‘extreme concern’ over U.S. weapons His comments came after Trump spoke by phone earlier Sunday with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, and Trump said he mentioned possibly sending Tomahawks during that conversation. “Do they want to have Tomahawks going in that direction? I don’t think so,” Trump said of Russia. “I think I might speak to Russia about that.” He added that “Tomahawks are a new step of aggression.” His suggestions followed Russia having attacked Ukraine’s power grid overnight, part of an ongoing campaign to cripple Ukrainian energy infrastructure before winter. Moscow also expressed “extreme concern” over the U.S. potentially providing Tomahawk cruise missiles to Ukraine. Putin himself has previously suggested that the United States supplying long-range missiles to Ukraine will seriously damage relations between Moscow and Washington. For his part, Zelenskyy described his latest call with Trump as “very productive,” and said the pair had discussed strengthening Ukraine’s “air defense, resilience, and long-range capabilities,” along with “details related to the energy sector.” VIDEO Trump in recent weeks has taken a notably tougher tact with Putin, after the Russian leader has declined to engage in direct talks with Zelenskyy about easing fighting. Last month, Trump announced that he now believes Ukraine could win back all the territory lost to Russia — a dramatic shift from the Republican’s repeated calls for Kyiv to make concessions to end Russia’s war in Ukraine. But the U.S. president, at least so far, has resisted Zelenskyy’s calls for Tomahawks. The weapon system would allow Ukraine to strike deeper into Russian territory and put the sort of pressure on Putin that Zelenskyy argues is needed to get the Russians to seriously engage in peace talks. Trump said aboard Air Force One of the war: “I really think Putin would look great if he got this settled” and that “It’s not going to be good for him” if not. ___ Weissert reported from Washington.

194e7dfc8e28,"On 12th day of shutdown, Vance warns new ‘painful’ cuts ahead","federal employees, federal workers, government shudown, j.d. vance, politics","Vice President JD Vance on Sunday said there will be deeper cuts to the federal workforce the longer the government shutdown goes on, adding to the uncertainty facing hundreds of thousands who are already furloughed without pay amid the stubborn stalemate in Congress. Vance warned that as the federal shutdown entered its 12th day, the new cuts would be “painful,” even as he said the Trump administration worked to ensure that the military is paid this week and some services would be preserved for low-income Americans, including food assistance. Still, hundreds of thousands of government workers have been furloughed in recent days and, in a court filing on Friday, the Office of Management and Budget said well over 4,000 federal employees would soon be fired in conjunction with the shutdown. The effects of the shutdown also grew Sunday with the Smithsonian announcing its museums, research centers and the National Zoo are temporarily closed going forward for lack of funding. “The longer this goes on, the deeper the cuts are going to be,” Vance said on Fox News’ “Sunday Morning Futures.” “To be clear, some of these cuts are going to be painful. This is not a situation that we relish. This is not something that we’re looking forward to, but the Democrats have dealt us a pretty difficult set of cards.” READ MORE: Trump directs Pentagon to use ‘all available funds’ to pay troops despite shutdown Labor unions have already filed a lawsuit to stop the aggressive move by President Donald Trump ’s budget office, which goes far beyond what usually happens in a government shutdown, further inflaming tensions between the Republicans who control Congress and the Democratic minority. The shutdown began on Oct. 1 after Democrats rejected a short-term funding fix and demanded that the bill include an extension of federal subsidies for health insurance under the Affordable Care Act. The expiration of those subsidies at the end of the year will result in monthly cost increases for millions. Trump and Republican leaders have said they are open to negotiations on the health subsidies, but insist the government must reopen first. For now, negotiations are virtually nonexistent. Dug in as ever, House leaders from both parties pointed fingers at each other in rival Sunday appearances on “Fox News Sunday.” “We have repeatedly made clear that we will sit down with anyone, anytime, anyplace,” said House Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries of New York. “Republicans control the House, the Senate and the presidency. It’s unfortunate they’ve taken a my-way-or-the-highway approach.” House Speaker Mike Johnson blamed Democrats and said they “seem not to care” about the pain the shutdown is inflicting. “They’re trying their best to distract the American people from the simple fact that they’ve chosen a partisan fight so that they can prove to their Marxist rising base in the Democratic Party that they’re willing to fight Trump and Republicans,” he said. VIDEO Progressive activists, meanwhile, expressed new support for the Democratic Party’s position in the shutdown fight. Ezra Levin, co-founder of the leading progressive protest group Indivisible, said he is “feeling good about the strength of Dem position.” He pointed to fractures in the GOP, noting that Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene publicly warned last week that health care insurance premiums would skyrocket for average Americans — including her own adult children — if nothing is done. “Trump and GOP are rightfully taking the blame for the shutdown and for looming premium increases,” Levin said. “Their chickens are coming home to roost.” And yet the Republican administration and its congressional allies are showing no signs of caving to Democratic demands or backing away from threats to use the opportunity to pursue deeper cuts to the federal workforce. Thousands of employees at the departments of Education, Treasury, Homeland Security and Health and Human Services, as well as the Environmental Protection Agency, are set to receive layoff notices, according to spokespeople for the agencies and union representatives for federal workers. “You hear a lot of Senate Democrats say, well, how can Donald Trump possibly lay off all of these federal workers?” Vance said. “Well, the Democrats have given us a choice between giving low-income women their food benefits and paying our troops on the one hand, and, on the other hand, paying federal bureaucrats.” Democrats say the firings are illegal and unnecessary. “They do not have to do this,” said Democratic Sen. Mark Kelly of Arizona on CNN’s “State of the Union.” “They do not have to punish people that shouldn’t find themselves in this position.” A free press is a cornerstone of a healthy democracy.

Kyiv regional Gov. Mykola Kalashnyk said two employees of Ukraine’s largest private energy company DTEK were wounded in Russian strikes on a substation. Ukraine’s Energy Ministry said that infrastructure was also targeted in the regions of Donetsk, Odesa and Chernihiv. “Russia continues its aerial terror against our cities and communities, intensifying strikes on our energy infrastructure,” Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy wrote on X, noting that Russia had launched “more than 3,100 drones, 92 missiles, and around 1,360 glide bombs” over the past week. READ MORE: How Europe can defend itself against Russian drones and electronic warfare Zelenskyy called for tighter secondary sanctions on buyers of Russian oil. “Sanctions, tariffs, and joint actions against the buyers of Russian oil — those who finance this war — must all remain on the table,” he wrote, adding he had a “very productive” phone call with U.S. President Donald Trump, in which they discussed strengthening Ukraine’s “air defense, resilience, and long-range capabilities,” along with “details related to the energy sector.” Their discussion followed an earlier conversation on Saturday, Zelenskyy said, during which the leaders agreed on Sunday’s topics. In an interview with Fox News Channel’s “The Sunday Briefing” after his call with Trump, Zelenskyy was asked whether Trump had approved the Tomahawks. “We work on it,” he said. “And I’m waiting for president to yes. Of course we count on such decisions, but we will see. We will see.” Zelenskyy said Friday that he was in talks with U.S. officials about the possible provision of various long-range precision strike weapons, including Tomahawks and more ATACMS tactical ballistic missiles. Trump, who has been frustrated by Russia in his efforts to end the war, said last week that he has “sort of made a decision” on whether to send Tomahawks to Ukraine, without elaborating. A senior Ukrainian delegation is set to visit the U.S. this week. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said in remarks published Sunday that “the topic of Tomahawks is of extreme concern.” “Now is really a very dramatic moment in terms of the fact that tensions are escalating from all sides,” he told Russian state television reporter Pavel Zarubin. VIDEO Belarus President Alexander Lukashenko, a close ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin, also said in comments released Sunday that he doubts the U.S. will provide Ukraine with Tomahawk cruise missiles. “I think we need to calm down in this regard. Our friend Donald … sometimes he takes a more forceful approach, and then, his tactic is to let go a little and step back. Therefore, we shouldn’t take this literally, as if it’s going to fly tomorrow,” Lukashenko told Zarubin, who posted them on his Telegram channel on Sunday. Ukraine’s energy sector has been a key battleground since Russia launched its all-out invasion more than three years ago. The latest attacks on Ukraine’s energy grid came after Russian drone and missile strikes wounded at least 20 people in Kyiv, damaged residential buildings and caused blackouts across the country Friday, which Prime Minister Yuliia Svyrydenko described as “one of the largest concentrated strikes” against Ukraine’s energy infrastructure. Each year, Russia has tried to cripple the Ukrainian power grid before the bitter winter season, apparently hoping to erode public morale. Winter temperatures run from late October through March, with January and February the coldest months. Ukraine’s air force said Saturday that its air defenses intercepted or jammed 103 of 118 Russian drones launched against Ukraine overnight, while Russia’s Defense Ministry said it had shot down 32 Ukrainian drones over Russian territory.

3f46d2ae00ae,China refuses to give in to Trump’s tariff threat,"china, donald trump news, tariffs, world","BEIJING (AP) — China signaled Sunday that it would not back down in the face of a 100% tariff threat from President Donald Trump, urging the U.S. to resolve differences through negotiations instead of threats. U.S. Vice President JD Vance defended Trump’s position and seemed to warn China not to be aggressive in its response. “China’s stance is consistent,” the Commerce Ministry said in a statement posted online. “We do not want a tariff war but we are not afraid of one.” It was China’s first official comment on Trump’s threat to jack up the tax on imports from China by Nov. 1 in response to new Chinese restrictions on the export of rare earths, which are vital to a wide range of consumer and military products. READ MORE: Wall Street tumbles in its worst day since April after Trump threatens more tariffs on China The back and forth threatens to derail a possible meeting between Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping and end a truce in a trade war in which new tariffs from both sides briefly topped 100% in April. In response, Vance said Sunday that Trump is committed to protecting America’s economic livelihoods while making the United States more self-sufficient. He said the fact that China has “so much control over critical supply in the United States of America” is the definition of a national emergency and therefore justifies Trump’s move to impose tough tariffs. “It’s going to be delicate dance and a lot of it is going to depend on how the Chinese respond. If they respond in a highly aggressive manner, I guarantee you the president of the United States has far more cards than the People’s Republic of China,” Vance said on Fox News Channel’s “Sunday Morning Futures.” “If, however, they’re willing to be reasonable, then Donald Trump is always willing to be a reasonable negotiator. We’re going to find out a lot in the weeks to come about whether China wants to start a trade war with us or whether they actually want to be reasonable,” Vance continued. “I hope they choose the path of reason. The president of the United States is going to defend America regardless.” Trump has raised taxes on imports from many U.S. trading partners since taking office in January, seeking to win concessions. China has been one of the few countries that hasn’t backed down, relying on its economic clout. “Frequently resorting to the threat of high tariffs is not the correct way to get along with China,” the Commerce Ministry said in its post, which was presented as a series of answers from an unnamed spokesperson to four questions from unspecified media outlets. The statement called for addressing any concerns through dialogue. “If the U.S. side obstinately insists on its practice, China will be sure to resolutely take corresponding measures to safeguard its legitimate rights and interests,” the post said. VIDEO In addition to the 100% tariff, Trump threatened to impose export controls on what he called “critical software,” without specifying what that means. Both sides accuse the other of violating the spirit of the truce by imposing new restrictions on trade. Trump said in a social media post that China is “becoming very hostile” and that it is holding the world captive by restricting access to rare earth metals and magnets. The Chinese Commerce Ministry post said the U.S. has introduced several new restrictions in recent weeks, including expanding the number of Chinese companies subject to U.S. export controls. On rare earths, the ministry said that export licenses would be granted for legitimate civilian uses, noting that the minerals also have military applications. The new regulations include a requirement that foreign companies get Chinese government approval to export items that contain rare earths sourced from China, no matter where the products are manufactured. China accounts for nearly 70% of the world’s rare earths mining and controls roughly 90% of their global processing. Access to the material is a key point of contention in trade talks between Washington and Beijing. The critical minerals go into many products, from jet engines, radar systems and electric vehicles to consumer electronics including laptops and phones. China’s export controls have hit European and other manufacturers, as well as American ones. The Commerce Ministry statement said that the U.S. is also ignoring Chinese concerns by going forward with new port fees on Chinese ships that take effect Tuesday. China announced Friday that it would impose port fees on American ships in response. Associated Press writer Darlene Superville in Washington contributed to this report.

b35e53f5b596,WATCH: Trump departs for Middle East as ceasefire agreement holds in Gaza,"donald trump news, egypt, israel, middle east, politics","WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump set off for Israel and Egypt on Sunday to celebrate the U.S.-brokered ceasefire and hostage deal between Israel and Hamas and urge Middle East allies to seize the opportunity to build a durable peace in the volatile region. It’s a fragile moment with Israel and Hamas only in the early stages of implementing the first phase of the Trump agreement designed to bring a permanent end to the war sparked by the Oct. 7, 2023, attack on Israel by Hamas-led militants. Trump thinks there is a narrow window to reshape the Mideast and reset long-fraught relations between Israel and its Arab neighbors. READ MORE: Trump achieved a breakthrough Gaza ceasefire, but a tough road lies ahead It is a moment, the Republican president says, that has been helped along by his administration’s support of Israel’s decimation of Iranian proxies, including Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon. “Very excited about this moment in time,” Trump told reporters before Air Force One took off. He said many people in both Israel and Arab countries were “cheering” the agreement, adding that “everybody’s amazed and their thrilled and we’re going to have an amazing time.” The White House says momentum is also building because Arab and Muslim states are demonstrating a renewed focus on resolving the broader, decades-long Israeli-Palestinian conflict and, in some cases, deepening relations with the United States. Trump’s comments as the trip began followed him saying Friday that, “I think you are going to have tremendous success and Gaza is going to be rebuilt” and that “you have some very wealthy countries, as you know, over there. It would take a small fraction of their wealth to do that. And I think they want to do it.” A tenuous point in the agreement The first phase of the ceasefire agreement calls for the release of the final 48 hostages held by Hamas, including about 20 believed to be alive; the release of hundreds of Palestinian prisoners held by Israel; a surge of humanitarian aid to Gaza; and a partial pullback by Israeli forces from Gaza’s main cities. Israeli troops on Friday finished withdrawing from parts of Gaza, triggering a 72-hour countdown under the deal for Hamas to release the Israeli hostages, potentially while Trump is on the ground there. He said he expected their return to be completed on Monday or Tuesday. Trump said he will first visit Israel, where he has been invited to address Israel’s parliament, the Knesset, an honor last extended to President George W. Bush during a visit in 2008. Trump then will travel to Egypt, where he and Egyptian President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi will lead a summit in Sharm el-Sheikh with leaders from more than 20 countries to discuss peace in Gaza and the broader Middle East. VIDEO It is a tenuous truce and it is unclear whether the sides have reached any agreement on Gaza’s postwar governance, the territory’s reconstruction and Israel’s demand that Hamas disarm. Negotiations over those issues could break down, and Israel has hinted it may resume military operations if its demands are not met. “I think the chances of (Hamas) disarming themselves, you know, are pretty close to zero,” H.R. McMaster, a national security adviser during Trump’s first term, said at an event hosted by the Foundation for the Defense of Democracies on Thursday. He said he thought what probably would happen in the coming months is that the Israeli military “is going to have to destroy them.” Israel continues to rule over millions of Palestinians without basic rights as settlements expand rapidly across the occupied West Bank. Despite growing international recognition, Palestinian statehood appears exceedingly remote because of Israel’s opposition and actions on the ground, The war has left Israel isolated internationally and facing allegations of genocide, which it denies. International arrest warrants against Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his former defense minister are in effect, and the United Nations’ highest court is considering allegations of genocide brought by South Africa. Hamas has been militarily decimated and has given up its only bargaining chip with Israel by releasing the hostages. But the Islamic militant group is still intact and could eventually rebuild if there’s an extended period of calm. Netanyahu reiterated that Israel would continue with its demilitarization of Hamas after the hostages are returned. “Hamas agreed to the deal only when it felt that the sword was on its neck — and it is still on its neck,” Netanyahu said Friday as Israel began to pull back its troops. Trump wants to expand the Abraham Accords Much of Gaza has been reduced to rubble and rebuilding is expected to take years. The territory’s roughly 2 million residents continue to struggle in desperate conditions. Under the deal, Israel agreed to reopen five border crossings, which will help ease the flow of food and other supplies into Gaza, parts of which are experiencing famine. Trump is also standing up a U.S.-led civil-military coordination center in Israel to help facilitate the flow of humanitarian aid as well as logistical and security assistance into Gaza. Roughly 200 U.S. troops will be sent to help support and monitor the ceasefire deal as part of a team that includes partner nations, nongovernmental organizations and private-sector players. The White House has signaled that Trump is looking to quickly return attention to building on a first-term effort known as the Abraham Accords, which forged diplomatic and commercial ties between Israel and the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Morocco. A permanent agreement in Gaza would help pave the path for Trump to begin talks with Saudi Arabia as well Indonesia, the most populous Muslim country, toward normalizing ties with Israel, according to a senior Trump administration official who briefed reporters on the condition of anonymity. Such a deal with Saudi Arabia, the most powerful and wealthy Arab state, has the potential to reshape the region and boost Israel’s standing in historic ways. But brokering such an agreement remains a heavy lift as the kingdom has said it won’t officially recognize Israel before a resolution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.

ab8c7113e5e4,"Appeals court rules U.S. troops Trump sent to Illinois can stay, but can’t be deployed for now","donald trump news, illinois, national guard, politics","CHICAGO (AP) — National Guard troops sent to Illinois by President Donald Trump can stay in the state and under federal control, but can’t be deployed to protect federal property or go on patrol for now, an appeals court ruled Saturday. READ MORE: What to know about Trump’s National Guard deployments in Chicago and Portland The decision comes after federal Judge April Perry on Thursday ruled to temporarily block the National Guard deployment for at least two weeks, finding no substantial evidence that a “danger of rebellion” is brewing in Illinois during Trump’s immigration crackdown. The appeals court on Saturday granted a pause in the case until it can hear further arguments. The on-again, off-again deployments stem from a political and legal battle over Trump’s push to send the Guard to several U.S. cities. His administration claims crime is rampant in those cities, despite statistics not always supporting that. If a president invokes the Insurrection Act, they can dispatch active duty military in states that fail to put down an insurrection or defy federal law. However, Perry said she found no substantial evidence that a “danger of rebellion” is brewing in Illinois during Trump’s immigration crackdown. She followed up Friday with an opinion that cites a mix of law and history, including the Federalist Papers, which were written in 1787-88 to support ratification of the U.S. Constitution. “There has been no showing that the civil power has failed,” Perry said. “The agitators who have violated the law by attacking federal authorities have been arrested. The courts are open, and the marshals are ready to see that any sentences of imprisonment are carried out. Resort to the military to execute the laws is not called for.” The judge said there was significant evidence that federal agents have been able to carry out their work, noting “huge increases in arrests and deportations.” The 500 Guard members from Texas and Illinois were mostly based at a U.S. Army Reserve Center in Elwood, southwest of Chicago.

John Yang: Good evening. I'm John Yang. It's day 11 of the government shutdown and there are still no signs of efforts to end the congressional stalemate that's blocking federal funding. President Trump says he's directed the Defense Department to use all available funds to make sure U.S. troops are paid on time on Wednesday. Tomorrow, the Smithsonian museums and the National Zoo will close as they run out of the unspent prior year funds they've been using to keep the doors open. The president's trying to increase pressure on Democrats, saying he'll pick and choose which furloughed workers get back pay and slash programs Democrats care about. The administration is also moving ahead with plans for mass firings. On Friday, federal workers began receiving notices telling them that they'll be laid off in 60 days. The administration says that more than 4,100 workers will be fired across seven agencies, the moves being challenged in court. Authorities say there are no survivors from a blast that leveled an explosives plant in Tennessee, Friday.

5aebbb062491,Trump directs Pentagon to use ‘all available funds’ to pay troops despite shutdown,"donald trump news, government shutdown, military pay, u.s. military, politics","WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump said Saturday that he has directed the Defense Department to use “all available funds” to ensure U.S. troops are paid Wednesday despite the government shutdown, a short-term fix that will not apply to the hundreds of thousands of federal workers who have been furloughed. Trump said in a social media post that he was acting because “our Brave Troops will miss the paychecks they are rightfully due on October 15th.” The Republican president’s directive removes one of the pressure points that could have forced Congress into action, likely ensuring that the shutdown — now in its 11th day and counting — extends into a third week and possibly beyond. But no similar action seems forthcoming for federal employees also working without pay while thousands are now being laid off during the lapse in government operations. The White House budget office started the layoffs on Friday. WATCH: Trump White House orders more federal layoffs amid shutdown Trump blamed Democrats and said he was exercising his authority as commander in chief to direct Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth “to use all available funds to get our Troops PAID on October 15th.” The Republican president added, “We have identified funds to do this, and Secretary Hegseth will use them to PAY OUR TROOPS.” U.S service members were in danger of not receiving their next paycheck on Wednesday after the government shut down on Oct. 1, the start of the federal budget cycle. The U.S. has about 1.3 million active-duty service members, and the prospect of troops going without pay has been a focal point when lawmakers on Capitol Hill have discussed the shutdown’s negative impact. Trump did not say where he’s getting the money. One possible source would be the billions of dollars that were pumped into the Defense Department under Trump’s big tax and spending cut bill that he signed into law in July. The Congressional Budget Office said such a move was possible. A spokesperson for the White House Office of Management and Budget said Pentagon research and development funds would be used to pay the salaries. Federal workers typically receive back pay after a shutdown ends, as now required by a law that Trump signed during his first term. He recently floated the idea of not making up the lost salaries. It was unclear if the president’s directive applies to the U.S. Coast Guard, which is a branch of the U.S. Armed Forces but is overseen by the Department of Homeland Security during peacetime. The nation’s third shutdown in 12 years has again raised anxiety levels among service members and their families as those in uniform are working without pay. While they would receive back pay once the impasse ends, many military families live paycheck to paycheck. During previous shutdowns, Congress passed legislation to ensure that troops kept earning their salaries, but discussion of taking a similar step by lawmakers appeared to have fizzled out. Asked earlier this week if he would support a bill to pay the troops, Trump said, “that probably will happen.” “We’ll take care of it,” he said Wednesday. “Our military is always going to be taken care of.” The shutdown began on Oct. 1 after Democrats rejected a short-term funding fix and demanded that the bill include an extension of federal subsidies for health insurance under the Affordable Care Act. The expiration of those subsidies at the end of the year will result in monthly cost increases for millions of people. Trump and Republican leaders have said they are open to negotiations on the health subsidies, but insist the government must reopen first. Both sides appear dug in on their positions, making it unclear when, or how, the shutdown ends. A free press is a cornerstone of a healthy democracy. Support trusted journalism and civil dialogue.

WATCH: After Biden’s diagnosis, a look at prostate cancer’s impact on men in the U.S. The 82-year-old Democrat left office in January after he had dropped his bid for reelection six months earlier following a disastrous debate against Republican Donald Trump amid concerns about Biden’s age, health and mental fitness. Trump defeated Democrat Kamala Harris, who was Biden’s vice president. In May, Biden’s postpresidential office announced that he had been diagnosed with prostate cancer and that it had spread to his bone. The discovery came after he reported urinary symptoms. Prostate cancers are graded for aggressiveness using what is known as a Gleason score. The scores range from 6 to 10, with 8, 9 and 10 prostate cancers behaving more aggressively. Biden’s office said his score was 9, suggesting his cancer is among the most aggressive. Last month, Biden had surgery to remove skin cancer lesions from his forehead.

1bab36ee4e74,"Candidates in Virginia governor’s debate clash over government shutdown, violent rhetoric","abigail spanberger, debates, elections, gubernatorial races, virginia, winsome earle-sears, politics","Spanberger, who largely avoided addressing her Republican opponent directly, set a more sterile and bipartisan tone. The personal clashes overshadowed the policy fights at times, which focused on violent rhetoric, the federal shutdown and transgender children. The economy was an afterthought. Here are some takeaways from the debate at Norfolk State University: A contrast in styles Perhaps even more than policy differences, the candidates’ personal styles shaped the debate. Earle-Sears, with her only chance to confront Spanberger before Election Day, was far more aggressive. She repeatedly turned toward Spanberger and interrupted her answers, despite being admonished by the moderators. The approach put the Democrat on the defensive after months of running the race largely on her own terms as the perceived frontrunner. Democratic gubernatorial candidate and former Rep. Abigail Spanberger, D-Va., addresses a small get-out-the-vote rally on the first day of early voting in Henrico, Virginia. Photo by Chip Somodevilla/ Getty Images Spanberger, while she criticized her opponent at times, faced forward throughout, avoided eye contact and only rarely addressed Earle-Sears directly. She did not speak during Earle-Sears’ answers, even when her opponent asked direct questions, resulting in moments of awkward silence. Earle-Sears told Spanberger she was a liar, said she “should have stayed in Congress” and questioned her courage. “Don’t lie like that, Abigail!” she shouted at one point. The interruptions lasted up until the very final moments, when the moderators cut off the microphones. A scandal at the outset A scandal shaped the very beginning of the debate, although it was not a scandal directly involving either candidate onstage. Instead, it was the Democratic nominee for attorney general, Jay Jones. He has been heavily criticized in recent days following last week’s publication of text messages from 2022 in which he suggested that Virginia’s former Republican House speaker get “two bullets in the head.” Earle-Sears, along with President Donald Trump, has demanded that Jones quit his race. Over and over again Thursday night, the Republican pushed Spanberger to do the same. “Abigail, what if he said it about your three children? Is that when you would say it’s time to get out of the race?” Earle-Sears asked. She later added, “She has no courage.” Facing repeated questions from the moderators and her opponent, the Democratic congresswoman declined to say whether Jones should leave the race, saying it’s up to voters to make their own decision. “I have denounced political violence, political rhetoric, no matter who is leading the charge,” Spanberger responded, pointing to violent rhetoric from Trump that Earle-Sears declined to denounce. “You routinely refer to me as your enemy. I’m not your enemy. You are not my enemy. We are political opponents,” Spanberger said. The shutdown The showdown over the shutdown flared Thursday night. Underway for more than a week, the federal shutdown is especially prevalent in Virginia, home to roughly 315,000 federal workers. Even before much of the federal government closed its doors last week, many Virginians were already affected by Trump’s spring push to slash federal jobs and his ongoing threats to impose more mass firings. Earle-Sears, a vocal Trump supporter, declined to criticize Trump or call on him to stop firing federal workers when asked directly by the moderators. Instead, she blamed Democrats for the mess and called on Spanberger to push Virginia Sens. Tim Kaine and Mark Warner, both Democrats, to vote in favor of a spending bill that would end the impasse with the Republican-controlled Congress. Spanberger responded, “I would encourage everyone, our Democratic senators, our Democratic House members, our Republican House members, to work and come back to the table.” Culture wars vs. wallets Many voters say they’re most concerned about the economy, but some of the most pointed moments of the debate were on cultural issues. In particular, Earle-Sears pressed Spanberger on whether she would keep transgender youths out of high school sports and bathrooms. The Republican lieutenant governor has flooded the airwaves with ads focused on the cultural divide that helped Trump win the presidency last fall, casting Spanberger as unwilling to protect Virginia’s children from sexual predators. “My answer is that each local community decision should be made between parents and educators and teachers in each community,” Spanberger said, pointing to her background in law enforcement and role as a mother. “Nothing is more important to me than the safety of all children,” she said. Spanberger declined to say whether she would rescind the measure signed by Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin that would require students to go only to the restrooms of their birth gender. That did not satisfy Earle-Sears, who pressed Spanberger on what she would say if her own children were forced to undress in a bathroom with biological males. The Republican also implied that transgender students are a safety threat when asked. “We know that biological men are larger in strength than women,” she said. “This is biology.” Spanberger then sought to put Earle-Sears on the defensive, noting that the Republican opposes abortion rights and wants to outlaw gay marriage — something Earle-Sears didn’t object to. “My opponent has previously said that she doesn’t think that gay couples have the right to marry,” Spanberger said. “That’s not discrimination,” Earle-Sears interrupted. History in the making Two women stood on the debate stage as the Democratic and Republican nominees for the first time in state history, a reminder that Virginia is poised to elect its first female governor, no matter who wins on Nov. 4. Spanberger, 46, is a mother of three school-age children. She has represented a congressional district in northern Virginia since 2019. She is a former CIA case officer. In one of the few warm exchanges of the night, Earle-Sears pointed to Spanberger’s role as a mother when asked what qualities she likes about her opponent. “I believe she is a devoted mom. I truly believe that,” Earle-Sears said. “And I do believe that she cares.” Earle-Sears, a Marine veteran, may be better known statewide, having served as lieutenant governor for the last four years. A native of Jamaica, the 61-year-old mother of two, is the first Black woman elected to statewide office in Virginia. Spanberger complimented parts of her record. “I admire her faith,” Spanberger said, “and her service to this country.” Peoples reported from New York. Beaumont reported from Des Moines, Iowa.

32ede57693c4,Trump White House orders more federal layoffs amid shutdown,"donald trump news, federal workers, government shutdown, russell vought, politics","As the federal government shutdown heads into its second weekend, the Trump administration has begun what it calls “substantial” layoffs of federal workers. President Trump and his team had suggested this would be coming, but it was Office of Management and Budget Director Russell Vought who made it official. Congressional correspondent Lisa Desjardins reports on the agencies affected. Geoff Bennett: As the federal government shutdown heads into its second weekend, the Trump administration has started what it says are substantial layoffs of federal workers. The president and his team had suggested this would be coming, but it was Office of Management and Budget Director Russell Vought who made it official on social media this afternoon, stating simply: ""The RIFs have begun."" For more on what agencies might be affected by this reduction in force, we turn to our congressional correspondent, Lisa Desjardins. Lisa, you have been working the phones all afternoon. Lisa Desjardins: Yes. Geoff Bennett: What have you learned? Lisa Desjardins: Our whole team has. Well, President Trump actually just spoke to reporters a few minutes ago. And he said the layoffs, there will be a lot of them, but that numbers will still be coming. We don't have the numbers yet. So there is a real question here about how widespread these substantial RIFs, or layoffs, are, as we have been told by the Office of Management and Budget. Are they really large, or is it that the administration wants them to be perceived that way, so that they can leverage and pressure Democrats, among others? One thing we do know a little bit about is where they are happening. From our calls and sourcing today, we can report that these eight agencies will be seeing these mass layoffs. This includes some large agencies like Department of Homeland Security, the Treasury and Education. Many of these did experience large staffing cuts, either from the DOGE retirement plan or from previous layoffs. Now, again, we don't know how large they are. The IRS has confirmed to me that there are in fact mass layoffs happening there, again, don't know how large. There is a union that has said they think perhaps 1,300 People may have been laid off at Treasury, but we need to see the notices. And one reason that's important is, when do these take effect? Thirty days, by law, is the minimum notice that must be given for these reductions in force. Geoff Bennett: And, as we said, there's a lot we don't know. But are there specific examples of agencies or programs that have been targeted for these cuts? Lisa Desjardins: We do know of one where we can get specific. This is a subagency of the Department of Homeland Security. It's known as CISA. That stands for the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency. They watch basically the digital world, the Internet, protect Americans from threats from that area. Now, I know, I have reported — well, first of all, the agency is about 2,500 people, for perspective; 127 of them are going to be laid off or have been laid off. So that's about 5 percent of the agency. But here's the thing. They are all within one subdivision, a subdivision that specializes in dealing with corporations and social media, the same subdivision that Republicans say took down political speech, and it is the one that was blocking disinformation dealing with Facebook. So that's a targeted agency that Republicans don't like; 70 percent of that group is being cut here. I bring this up because President Trump also just told reporters that, again, this will be Democratic-oriented cuts. So we have to watch. What does this mean agency to agency? How much of it is about policy? Geoff Bennett: Lisa Desjardins, our thanks to you, as always.

8062b58dd383,WATCH: Kilmar Abrego Garcia’s attorneys discuss ICE’s continued efforts to deport him to Africa,"africa, deportations, eswatini, ghana, immigration, immigration and customs enforcement, kilmar abrego garcia, politics","GREENBELT, Md. (AP) — The Trump administration is pushing again to deport Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Maryland man who was mistakenly sent to El Salvador, and hasn’t given up on moving him to Eswatini or Ghana even though both have rejected the idea, an immigration official told a judge Friday. Abrego Garcia has challenged efforts to re-deport him to a third country after the government admitted that a previous order prevents his deportation to his home country of El Salvador. U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement said recently that it plans to deport him to the southern African country of Eswatini. WATCH: Kilmar Abrego Garcia’s attorney discusses his case amid new deportation effort The case has come to represent the bitter partisan struggle over the President Donald Trump’s sweeping immigration policy and mass deportation agenda. U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis in Maryland will decide whether Abrego Garcia should remain in custody or be released from immigration detention while his challenge moves forward. She ordered government officials to explain the steps they have taken to remove Abrego Garcia to another country. An ICE official told the judge during a hearing Friday that the government was continuing to talk with officials in Eswatini about sending him there even though the country rejected the idea this week. He said his understanding is that the administration also was still in discussions with Ghana. However, Ghana’s foreign minister, Sam Okudzeto Ablakwa, posted on social media Friday that the nation will not accept Abrego Garcia. Abrego Garcia could be removed within 72 hours if the judge allows it and once the administration receives approval from a third country, said John Schultz, a deputy assistant director who helps oversee removals for ICE. “We could quickly operationalize the removal,” Schultz said. Abrego Garcia’s attorneys have charged that the Republican administration is trying to illegally use the immigration system to punish him after the embarrassment of his mistaken deportation. Meanwhile, attorneys in criminal court in Tennessee have made similar claims about retribution in the human smuggling charges brought against Abrego Garcia in June on the day he was returned to the U.S. from El Salvador. The Tennessee judge has concluded that Abrego Garcia’s prosecution may be an illegal retaliation after he successfully sued the Trump administration over his deportation. The smuggling charges stem from a 2022 traffic stop in Tennessee. Abrego Garcia was not charged at the time, and agents did not begin investigating the stop until earlier this year after his wife sued over his deportation. At a Friday hearing in Nashville, U.S. District Judge Waverly Crenshaw said he will hear evidence on the motion to dismiss the charges on Nov. 3. In addition, defense attorneys said they intend to file a motion asking that statements unrelated to the smuggling charges be removed from the indictment. Attorney Jenna Dabbs cited allegations that her client is a member of the MS-13 gang as an example of the extraneous accusations that are not relevant to the actual charges. Trump administration officials have waged a relentless public relations campaign against Abrego Garcia, repeatedly referring to him as a member of MS-13, among other things, despite the fact he has not been convicted of any crimes.

0b68692ef442,"Trump showing ‘no interest’ in negotiating to end shutdown, Jeffries says","donald trump news, government shutdown, hakeem jeffries, politics","Geoff Bennett: Well, keeping our focus on the shutdown, yesterday, we heard from Republican Senate Majority Leader John Thune. And, today, for a Democratic view, I spoke earlier with House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries. Leader Jeffries, welcome back to the ""News Hour."" Rep. Hakeem Jeffries (D-NY): Thanks for having me on. Geoff Bennett: When you were on this program nine days ago, you said there'd been no communication from either the White House or Republican leaders in the House or the Senate about ending this shutdown. It doesn't appear that that's changed. Has it? Rep. Hakeem Jeffries: It has not changed, unfortunately. This is day 10 of the Trump-Republican shutdown. Clearly, they don't want to reopen the government. As Democrats, we have made clear we will sit down with anyone, any time, any place to have a bipartisan negotiation about enacting a spending bill that makes life better for the American people, reopens the government, and addresses the Republican health care crisis. Unfortunately, House Republicans, who canceled votes last week, canceled votes this week, and have now canceled votes next week, remain on vacation, missing in action. And Donald Trump has shown no interest in actually trying to resolve this situation. Geoff Bennett: What do you make of these Republican proposals to partially reopen the government, funding select agencies, while leaving other ones shuttered? Rep. Hakeem Jeffries: I think it's important for us to make sure that we actually pay our men and women in uniform in a manner consistent with what has been done in prior shutdowns. That should be priority number on, at this moment, more than 1.3 million people who are on active-duty and have been asked to work without pay because of the Republican refusal to address this issue. And so I think we need to take that step forward and then evaluate whatever other proposals come forward relative to reopening the government. But we have to reopen the government in a way that also addresses the Republican health care crisis and the Republicans' continued refusal to extend the Affordable Care Act tax credits, which is going to have a devastating impact on premiums, co-pays, and deductibles for tens of millions of Americans all across the country. Geoff Bennett: As we speak this afternoon, the OMB director, Russ Vought, tweeted moments ago, ""The RIFs have begun,"" making good apparently on the threat of mass layoffs by the Trump administration. An OMB spokesperson says that the layoffs will be significant. Do you have a sense of which agencies would be affected, how many people would be affected? And, beyond that, this is a clear power play by the administration to force the hand of Democrats. Does this play any role in your decision-making? Rep. Hakeem Jeffries: Donald Trump and his corrupt administration have been engaging in mass firings and layoffs of federal employees since January 20. They have been targeting hardworking federal employees, pressuring them, dismissing them without justification and violating the law. So this is just a continuation of the chaos, the crisis, and the confusion that we have seen during the entirety of the Trump administration. We're going to continue to stay the course as Democrats. That's what House and Senate Democrats have done together to address this the situation that Republicans have created, largest cut to Medicaid in American history, hospitals, nursing homes, and community-based health clinics closing all throughout America, particularly in rural parts of this country. The fact that Republicans refuse to extend the Affordable Care Act tax credits, resulting in dramatically increased health care premiums for tens of millions of Americans that will cost double, triple, or quadruple what they are currently paying. Some will face medical bankruptcy. Many others will be unable to get the insurance and the access to the doctors that they need. And on top of all of that, they're targeting the National Institutes of Health, the Centers for Disease Control in ways that are going to undermine the public health infrastructure in the United States of America. This has been an all-out Republican assault on the health care of the American people, which is why it needs to be decisively addressed right now, because it impacts everyone. Geoff Bennett: When you talk about Democrats and Republicans working together on health care, Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene, who, as you well know, no fan of Democrats, not typically aligned with Democrats, says she supports preserving the ACA subsidies, in large part because she says the insurance premiums of her adult children are set to skyrocket. Does that signal any real opening for bipartisan cooperation? Rep. Hakeem Jeffries: I think what it signals is a growing recognition amongst my Republican colleagues that we have a health care crisis. Unfortunately, it's the health care crisis that they have created. And it needs to be decisively addressed. House Republican leaders continue to bury their heads in the sand, unfortunately, and they're joined by Senate Republican leadership that continues to force vote after vote on their partisan Republican spending bill that Democrats aren't supporting because that partisan Republican spending bill continues to gut the health care of everyday Americans. And that's not an acceptable situation in this country, the wealthiest country in the history of the world. Geoff Bennett: I want to ask you about the politics of all this, because, just the other day, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, he said that Democrats have the momentum and he said — quote — ""Every day gets better for us."" Republicans are seizing upon that, including the Senate majority leader, John Thune, who was on this program last night, and they are accusing Democrats of politicizing the shutdown. Do you worry that a moment like that, a statement like that undercuts what you see as Democrats having the moral high ground? Rep. Hakeem Jeffries: Well, House Democrats and Senate Democrats led by Leader Schumer are in this fight to make life better for the American people, to lower health care costs, to address the Republican health care crisis, to cancel the cuts, and to save the health care of the American people. That's the reason why we're in this fight. Geoff Bennett: For federal workers who risk missing a paycheck, for military families facing uncertainty, for everyday Americans who want to visit a national park, they are all wondering, when will this shutdown end? What would you tell them? Rep. Hakeem Jeffries: We need Donald Trump and Republicans to come to the negotiating table. We want to reopen the government. We want to reopen it now. We want to reach a bipartisan agreement in a way that spends taxpayer dollars that actually improve the quality of life of the American people, that addresses the cost of living crisis that we're confronting in this country. Donald Trump and Republicans promised that costs would go down on day one. But costs aren't going down under Republican control of government here in Washington. Costs are going up. Inflation is going up. The Trump tariffs are making life more expensive for millions of Americans who are paying thousands of dollars in additional expense per year. And now we're on the brink of this massive increase in premiums, co-pays, and deductibles because of Republican refusal to sit down and negotiate an extension around the Affordable Care Act tax credits. We stand by our hardworking federal employees. We will continue to support them. We stand by the American people, and we want to bring this to a close, but we need good faith partners on the other side of the aisle to sit down and negotiate a bipartisan path forward. Geoff Bennett: House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries, thanks again for your time. We appreciate it. Rep. Hakeem Jeffries: Thank you.",https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/trump-showing-no-interest-in-negotiating-to-end-shutdown-jeffries-says,Politics,BBC,,https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/static/2025/10/shutdown-3-1024x683.jpg,2025-10-10T18:40:06-04:00,2896766906d292c8950a8987bc940cceb6b5b7e0
c5049f71e260,Unlikely alliance builds cleaner geothermal energy network in Massachusetts community,"basic research, geothermal energy, massachusetts, science, tipping point, science","Geoff Bennett: Now the story of an unlikely partnership between a utility company and climate activists and how they worked together to help one community switch its heating and cooling to a cleaner source. Science correspondent Miles O'Brien has the story, part of our Tipping Point coverage on energy and climate. Miles O’Brien: Retired schoolteacher Carol Canova has lived in this tiny little house in Framingham, Massachusetts for 30 years. From this humble perch, she has experienced firsthand a historic energy transition. She started with an oil-burning furnace, then switched to gas, and now heats and cools with an electric heat pump attached to a geothermal well. Carol Canova, Framingham, Massachusetts, Resident: I was told it would be even heat. I was told it would be efficient and so forth. But seeing is believing. I'd never been in a house that every place in the house was the same temperature. Miles O’Brien: Canova is part of a first-in-the-nation pilot by utility giant Eversource. It's a one-mile network of underground pipes connecting three dozen homes and municipal buildings to a shared geothermal well. It's called networked geothermal, and if it works here, it could be a blueprint for utilities nationwide. Carol Canova: So I thought, oh, electricity is expensive. So I'm expecting it's going to be more expensive. What I find out is, it's overall cheaper. Miles O’Brien: Heat pumps live up to their name. They move heat. In the summer, they pump heat out of your home. In the winter, they bring it in. How hard they have to work and how much electricity they use depends on the temperature difference between inside and outside. The greater the gap, the more energy they need. Shallow geothermal wells tap into the earth's steady underground temperature, about 55 degrees year-round. Water with antifreeze circulates through buried pipes, absorbing or releasing heat at that consistent temperature. A heat pump paired with a geothermal well has less work to do and is far more efficient no matter the weather above. The catch? Drilling a geothermal well is very expensive, but none of the volunteers in this project paid a dime for either the well or the heat pump. Carol Canova: When Eversource offered it, I thought, you know what, this is like winning the lottery. Nikki Bruno, Vice President, Eversource: Everything else is buried in underground, except for the heat pumps. Miles O’Brien: Nikki Bruno is an Eversource V.P. Nikki Bruno: So, right outside this building is what we call the main bore field. Miles O’Brien: She showed me the pump house, which controls the entire system. It's the only visible sign of the geothermal network. Nikki Bruno: Those bores are 600 to 700 pipes that allow the water-based fluid to circulate and exchange energy with the underground. Miles O’Brien: Besides many homes like Carol's, heat pumps attached to the geothermal network are in use at a school administration building, a fire station, and a public housing development. It's an $18.6 million project that comes amid significant changes in regulations. Massachusetts and the other states in the Eversource territory have aggressive climate goals and mandates. Nikki Bruno: How do we start offering something different? How can we produce a decarbonized product for our customers, while keeping safe, reliable and I will say as affordable as possible service to customers? Miles O’Brien: The idea was born of an unlikely partnership between utility executives and climate activists, among them, Zeybeb Magavi, the executive director of the nonprofit HEET, the Home Energy Efficiency Team. It's a grassroots group that started out by banding together to insulate their homes. They were looking for a way to make a bigger dent. Zeybeb Magavi, Executive Director, HEET: We really became aware of kind of a rock-and-a-hard place problem, where we have a gas system that actually we have pipes in the ground from President Lincoln's time. Miles O’Brien: Their focus on creaky, leaky gas pipes led them to a moment of insight and inspiration. Zeybeb Magavi: The ground, the bedrock, the water all around us is thermal energy, which we can tap. And that's kind of an exciting awakening thing to realize. We could potentially build a utility street by street that was pipes filled with water, maintained and managed by the gas utility, who — becomes a thermal utility. This infrastructure would be in a way like the roots of our new energy system, right? Miles O’Brien: Even federal researchers are bullish. A study by the Oak Ridge National Laboratory found that mass adoption of geothermal heat pumps could reduce the demand for electricity by 13 percent in the next 25 years. But the idea isn't new. Let's go down in the boiler room. Here we go. You got people down here shoveling coal, right? Jeff Tester, Engineering Professor, Cornell University: This is our living laboratory. Miles O’Brien: Cornell University engineering professor Jeff Tester built his home in Ithaca, New York, as a living lab of efficiency, solar thermal, photovoltaics, and a heat pump that taps into a geothermal well buried in his backyard. He's been advocating for ways to tap the heat beneath our feet since the 1970s, when he helped pioneer a novel geothermal energy concept at the Los Alamos National Laboratory. Jeff Tester: One method of extracting heat or mining heat from under the surface of the earth is to create a reservoir. Miles O’Brien: He looks back on those days with nostalgia. Jeff Tester: They were very supportive of trying new things in those days. We weren't afraid to try something. Miles O’Brien: For about 25 years, Cornell has harnessed a natural thermal engine to keep its campus cool. A district-chilling system taps 39-degree water from the depths of Cayuga Lake to cool more than 100 buildings. Now the university is looking to go deeper and warmer. Jeff Tester is the principal investigator on a groundbreaking project to introduce geothermal heating to the campus. In 2022, his team drilled a nearly two-mile-deep test borehole to assess the available heat resources here. Jeff Tester: I feel like I have been training all my life for the day when we actually would see this happen on a campus like Cornell. Miles O’Brien: But he's still waiting, looking for money to build a geothermal network of pipes filled with hot water to heat the campus. He says society places great value on fossil fuels and electricity. Jeff Tester: But heat is not viewed that way in the same way, and I think we need a fairer system of what I refer to as an equivalent way to actually look at the benefits from clean heating versus clean electricity versus clean fuels. And we're not doing that right now. So we need a new value system for energy. Miles O’Brien: The Trump administration apparently does value geothermal. Energy Secretary Chris Wright consistently emphasizes it as a priority, making it the only renewable energy source currently in favor. Zeybeb Magavi: It's something we can agree on. It's the ground beneath our feet. Turns out we have common ground. Miles O’Brien: And it appears to be growing. Plans are now in place to double the size of the Framingham geothermal network starting next year. Common ground may be hard to find these days, but perhaps it's not far beneath the surface.

6eead56302a0,Brooks and Capehart on Trump’s focus on reaching the Gaza peace deal,"brooks and capehart, politics","Geoff Bennett: With President Trump celebrating victories abroad and targeting political enemies here at home, there is much to discuss tonight with Brooks and Capehart. That's New York Times columnist David Brooks and Jonathan Capehart of MSNBC. With a hello to you both. Jonathan Capehart: Hey, Geoff. Geoff Bennett: So both Israel and Hamas have agreed to phase one of the peace plan. We see the negotiations there on the screen. And that was followed by today celebrations in Israel and also along the Gaza Strip. I want to start with your reaction to this real breakthrough, Jonathan. Jonathan Capehart: Look, I'm going to say something that I have never said before and that this audience has never heard me say before. Kudos to the president. I think we are at this point because the president was single — he was focused, single-mindedly focused, on getting something, getting a deal done, getting the hostages out. The hard part comes after he leaves the region, after we get past phase one, assuming we get the 20 — that the Israeli hostages released, the 20 who are presumed alive, after the 2,000 Palestinians are released by Israel. Once we get past that, there are so many questions that are still out there that leaves me skeptical that my kudos to the president will maintain. One, will they be able to get Hamas disarmed? Two, will there be a legitimate negotiating partner among the Palestinians for Israel and everyone to negotiate with, an international stabilization force for the area? And also the big thing, sort of Palestinian self-governance, or, in other words, a two-state solution, something that Prime Minister Netanyahu has made clear he's not interested in. And if we're going to get through all these phases of this peace plan, the single-minded focus of the president that got us to this crucial point will be needed for the next 19 phases. And I just don't see how he does that. Geoff Bennett: And given the history of dashed hopes in the region, what gives you hope that this agreement can endure? David Brooks: I got hope when Jonathan praised the president. (Laughter) David Brooks: So I have my fingers crossed he deserves the Nobel Prize. I thought you were going to go there. (Laughter) David Brooks: But it's impressive, what Trump has — did. First, he got together with the Saudis and the Qataris in New York during U.N. week and came up with this 20-point plan. And then he understood how to deal with Netanyahu. And I should say, in fairness, the Trump administration, both the first term and the second term, has been better on the Middle East than the Obama and Biden administration. There's something about that region he sort of gets. And so the way to deal with Biden — the way you deal with Netanyahu is, you show total support for Israel at the same time you're leaning on them. And so I think that the Biden people, when they were always withdrawing and threatening and saying, don't do that, that made Israel feel insecure. And they had to negotiate from a position of security and then they could bend. And so he got Bibi to go against his far right colleagues who wanted to basically annex the Gaza. And there is, like, now a separate Gaza territory, and that's an important achievement. The Qataris are an important role. Why is this little country in the center of all this? Partly because they are part of those Gulf states who wanted to make the Middle East a modern place. And so I think they play just tremendously a constructive role because they seem to talk to everybody. Will it work? I don't know, but there's no choice. There's no solution. Martin Indyk, who died about a year ago, had a piece in ""Foreign Affairs"" called the strange revival, I'm summarizing, of the two-state solution. Everybody wants to give up on the two-state solution. There is no alternative to the two-state solution. And so they're just going to have to stumble their way forward. Are they going to get there? Who knows? We have been covering the Middle East for a long time. They don't get there. But it looks a lot better than I thought it would look six months ago, a year ago, five years ago. Geoff Bennett: Yes. Well, shifting our focus to domestic politics, this past week, we saw former FBI Director James Comey arraigned, we saw New York Attorney General Letitia James indicted, both by the same Trump-appointed prosecutor. The former Trump National Security Adviser turned Trump critic John Bolton could be next, according to reports from MSNBC. And we talked about this last week, when the focus was solely on Comey, but President Trump's campaign of retribution is expanding. Jonathan Capehart: Yes, because this is what he told us he was going to do. The people he — the folks who have been indicted or expected to be indicted soon or on the list, people like Senator Adam Schiff of California, private citizen now Miles Taylor, the president made it clear that he wants something done and he wants his Justice Department to do it. He's on the record as saying they are guilty of something. Pam, go find it, Pam being the attorney general, Pam Bondi. So this is chilling because you now have a Justice Department that is supposed to, at least nominally, be separate and removed from the White House, taking orders from the president of the United States, who famously said, where's my Roy Cohn? Well, his Roy Cohn is named Pam Bondi. Geoff Bennett: David, there are supporters of the president who say that Letitia James ran on a campaign of going after Donald Trump and that this is simply accountability coming full circle, that this is justified reciprocity, to which you would say what? David Brooks: Well, that's how Donald Trump clearly thinks. He thinks they were politically motivated prosecutions. And I somewhat agree with him. I don't think Trump would have been brought up on those charges if he hadn't been Donald Trump. Nonetheless, what matters is the evidence. And Letitia James, she's accused of doing mortgage fraud that would have produced a benefit over the lifetime of the loan of $18,000. Now, you think about the numbers Donald Trump inflated his property values, they were not $18,000. They were times 100 million of that. And so the evidence against Comey is slight. The case against James is — it would have been — no one would have prosecuted. We know that because other prosecutors refused to do it. Jonathan Capehart: Right. David Brooks: And so this is clearly a revenge prosecution. Donald Trump makes it hard on us pundits, because he's so blatant, there's nothing interesting to say. (Laughter) Geoff Bennett: It is kind of all out there in the open. Jonathan Capehart: Right. It's out there. Geoff Bennett: Well, today marks the 10th day of the government shutdown, as we heard from the House Democratic leader. There has still been no substantive talks among the different parties. October 15, I have that day circled on my calendar because that's the day that if they're — if the government is still shut down, members of the military, if things stay the way they are, who have been deemed essential, they have been on the job, they will not get a paycheck. I mean, what do you make of all this at this point? Jonathan Capehart: You know why there aren't talks? Because the Republicans are not in town. The speaker of the House has kept the House out of session now for 20-some — 19 or 20 days and has already said that they're not coming back next week. You would think that the House speaker being on C-SPAN and taking that very emotional call on the Republican line, a woman saying — a military wife talking about the need for, like, the — not only health care, but for the check, for the paycheck, and saying, get — where are you guys? Get back to work. And he pivoted and blamed the Democrats. If they want to change the calculus of this conversation, they being Republicans, they should come back to town, because, if everyone's in town, then there's no excuse. Democrats will be in town in the House, will be in town next week. Why not come back to town and say, you want to talk, let's talk? Geoff Bennett: When even Marjorie Taylor Greene is calling out her own party and saying we need to fix for the Obamacare subsidies, what does that say about the internal dynamics within the GOP? David Brooks: Not much, I don't think. Marjorie Taylor Greene is out there and wherever she is. I think Republicans, like the Democrats, frankly, are pretty unified. And the weird thing about that is usually, when you cover a shutdown, somebody's feeling the heat. Nobody's feeling the heat yet. I don't think… Geoff Bennett: Yes, why is that? David Brooks: I think two things. One, the American people haven't yet felt it. Maybe, if you air travel, you will begin to feel it. When the military doesn't get paid, they feel it. But right now they're not feeling it. I was in Colorado this week, and, believe me, nobody was raising this with me. Nobody talked about it. That may change. Second, the American people have become so jaded and disgusted that they're just like, oh, whatever. And so if you look at the polling, at the beginning, it looked like they were more blaming Trump. But now, if you look at, do you approve of the way Democrats in House and Republicans in Congress, how are they handling it, it's like both get a 28 positive rating, so a low rating on both parties. But it's not really fueling the heat on either of these people. The second thing that I think there's — it's quite easy to cut a deal if the shutdown is really what Hakeem Jeffries said it was, which was about health care premiums. And it is partly about that. And Democrats, of course, are smart to talk that way because it's an issue that polls great for them. But I don't think it's only about that. For a lot of Democrats, it's also about Trump's authoritarianism. It's Trump's willingness to dishonor and disrespect Congress and not spend the money they have appropriated. And that's a much deeper issue that's much harder to resolve, because Donald Trump is not doing that. And then the Trump — the Republicans are also a little divided. Russell Vought did — the RIFs are starting today. There are a lot of congressional Republicans that don't like that. Geoff Bennett: Yes. David Brooks: And so there are these tensions within both parties. But, so far, they — their feet is not to the fire. But that may come in a couple weeks. Geoff Bennett: Well, as the shutdown drags on and more layoff notices keep landing, should Democrats hold the line? Jonathan Capehart: Yes. Yes, because I actually do think that they are pushing on health care because it's something that they care about. And, I mean, I take your point that the American people aren't feeling it writ large. But when you have a Republican calling on the Republican line on C-SPAN to chastise the Republican House speaker — the Republican House speaker, and you have got the poster child for MAGA, who is also saying, you know this premiums thing is an issue, to me, that says that the ground is shifting. And I also agree with David in this. While health care is the overarching, sort of popular issue because it's something that will affect the American people directly, rescissions has been my hobbyhorse, because why would and should Democrats trust any negotiation that they get into with Republicans and that is signed by the president if they know that, once — before the ink is dry, Russell Vought And the president will snatch back the money, snatch back the authority? Geoff Bennett: Jonathan Capehart, David Brooks, our thanks to you both. Jonathan Capehart: Thanks, Geoff.

7086a8421575,WATCH: Trump announces deal with AstraZeneca to lower drug prices for Medicaid,"astrazeneca, donald trump news, drug prices, medicaid, pharmaceutical industry, politics","WASHINGTON (AP) — AstraZeneca on Friday became the second major pharmaceutical manufacturer to announce it had agreed to lower the cost of prescription drugs for Medicaid under a deal struck with the Trump administration that avoided its threats of steep tariffs. Watch the announcement in the video player above. President Donald Trump made the announcement in the Oval Office with AstraZeneca CEO Pascal Soriot, who said that during tough negotiations to reach a deal, Trump and his team of officials had “really kept me up at night.” Under the agreement, AstraZeneca will charge most-favored-nation pricing to Medicaid, while guaranteeing such pricing on newly launched drugs, Trump said. That involves matching the lowest price offered in other developed nations. WATCH: Trump announces Pfizer deal to lower drug prices “For many years, Americans have paid the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs, by far,” Trump said, adding that the new deal may cut prices to “the lowest price anywhere in the world. That’s what we get.” AstraZeneca CEO Pascal Soriot shakes hands with President Donald Trump during an announcement about lowering U.S. drug prices, at the White House in Washington, D.C., Oct. 10, 2025. Photo by Kent Nishimura/Reuters AstraZeneca’s deal follows a similar agreement Pfizer announced late last month. Advocates have generally praised the administration’s efforts to cut drug prices, though some have expressed concerns that too much onus is being placed on the manufacturers to lower costs without implementing U.S. policy safeguards to ensure such outcomes. Both agreements, however, build on an executive order Trump signed in May that set a deadline for drugmakers to electively lower prices or face new limits on what the government will pay. Trump had suggested that a series of deals with drug companies would subsequently be coming. “The tariffs were a big reason he came here,” Trump said of Soriot. Cambridge, United Kingdom-based AstraZeneca makes a range of cancer treatments. Its products include the lung cancer drug Tagrisso; Lynparza, an oral treatment for ovarian cancer, and Calquence, which treats chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Those drugs brought in a total of more than $7.5 billion in U.S. sales last year. AstraZeneca announced Thursday that it would spend $4.5 billion on a new manufacturing plant near Charlottesville, Virginia, and its Republican governor, Glenn Youngkin, spoke during Friday’s Oval Office announcement to cheer groundbreaking on the new facility. The drugmaker said that project was the centerpiece of $50 billion in investments the company plans to make in the U.S. by 2030. AstraZeneca said it plans to reach $80 billion in total revenue by then, half of which will be generated in the United States. Trump predicted the investment’s could lead to 3,600 jobs domestically “just to begin with.” One of the AstraZeneca drugs was already subject to price reductions due to a Medicare negotiating strategy implemented under President Biden. Still, Trump insisted that Democrats shouldn’t “get credit” and suggested the party’s key leaders may try. The announcements came months after AstraZeneca said it was scrapping plans to expand a vaccine manufacturing plant in its home country. The company blamed several factors, including reduced government financial support. The Trump administration has put up a landing page for its new website, TrumpRX.gov, where people will be able to buy drugs directly from manufacturers, according to officials. Both Pfizer and AstraZeneca will offer medications through the site, according to the administration. The website’s landing page features two very large pictures of Trump and a promise that the site is “Coming Soon” in January 2026. It says at the bottom of the page that the site was “Designed in DC by The National Design Studio,” the new government website design hub that Trump created by executive order in August, which is being led by Airbnb co-founder Joe Gebbia.

6261c4327222,Wall Street tumbles in its worst day since April after Trump threatens more tariffs on China,"china, donald trump news, stock markets, tariffs, wall street, economy","NEW YORK (AP) — A monthslong calm on Wall Street shattered Friday, and U.S. stocks tumbled after President Donald Trump threatened to crank tariffs much higher on China. The S&P 500 sank 2.7% in its worst day since April. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 878 points, or 1.9%, and the Nasdaq composite fell 3.6%. Stocks had been heading for a slight gain in the morning, until Trump took to his social media platform and said he’s considering “a massive increase of tariffs” on Chinese imports. He’s upset at restrictions China has placed on exports of its rare earths, which are materials that are critical for the manufacturing of everything from consumer electronics to jet engines. READ MORE: Trump threatens more tariffs after China restricts key exports “We have been contacted by other Countries who are extremely angry at this great Trade hostility, which came out of nowhere,” Trump wrote on Truth Social. He also said “now there seems to be no reason” to meet with China’s leader, Xi Jinping, after earlier agreeing to do so as part of an upcoming trip to South Korea. The ratchet higher in tensions between the world’s largest economies led to widespread drops across Wall Street, with roughly six out of every seven stocks within the S&P 500 falling. Nearly everything weakened, from Big Tech companies like Nvidia and Apple to stocks of smaller companies looking to get past uncertainty about tariffs and trade. The market may have been primed for a slide. U.S. stocks were already facing criticism that their prices had shot too high following the S&P 500’s nearly relentless 35% run from a low in April. The index, which dictates the movements for many 401(k) accounts, is still near its all-time high set earlier in the week. Critics say the market looks too expensive after prices rose much faster than corporate profits. Worries are particularly high about companies in the artificial-intelligence industry, where pessimists see echoes of the 2000 dot-com bubble that imploded. For stocks to look less expensive, either their prices need to fall, or companies’ profits need to rise. Levi Strauss dropped 12.6% for one of the market’s larger losses, even though it reported a stronger profit for the latest quarter than analysts expected. Its forecast for profit over the full year was also within range of Wall Street’s estimates, but the jeans and clothing company could simply be facing the challenge of heightened expectations after a big run. Its stock price came into the day with a surge of nearly 42% for the year so far. All told, the S&P 500 fell 182.60 points to 6,552.51. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 878.82 to 45,479.60, and the Nasdaq composite sank 820.20 to 22,204.43. Some of Friday’s strongest action was in the oil market, where the price of a barrel of benchmark U.S. crude sank 4.2% to $58.90. It fell as a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas came into effect in Gaza. An end to the war could remove worries about disruptions to oil supplies, which had kept crude’s price higher than it otherwise would have been. Losses accelerated following Trump’s tariff threat, which could gum up global trade and lead the economy to burn less fuel. Brent crude, the international standard, dropped 3.8% to $62.73 per barrel. In the bond market, the yield on the 10-year Treasury sank to 4.05% from 4.14% late Thursday. It had already been lower before Trump made his threats, as a report from the University of Michigan suggested that sentiment among U.S. consumers remains in the doldrums. “Pocketbook issues like high prices and weakening job prospects remain at the forefront of consumers’ minds,” according to Joanne Hsu, director of the Surveys of Consumers. “At this time, consumers do not expect meaningful improvement in these factors.” The job market has slowed so much that the Federal Reserve cut its main interest rate last month for the first time this year. Fed officials have penciled in more cuts through next year to give the economy additional breathing room. But Chair Jerome Powell has also said they may change course if inflation stays high. That’s because lower interest rates can push inflation even higher. One potentially encouraging signal from the University of Michigan’s preliminary survey said consumers’ expectations for inflation in the coming year edged down to 4.6% from 4.7% the month before. While that’s still high, the direction of change could help the Fed and limit upward pressure on inflation. In stock markets abroad, indexes fell across much of Europe and Asia. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng fell 1.7%, and France’s CAC 40 dropped 1.5% for two of the bigger moves. But South Korea’s Kospi leaped 1.7% after trading reopened following a holiday.

2560a83cd2ad,MIT president rejects proposal to adopt Trump priorities for funding benefits,"colleges and universities, donald trump news, higher education, massachusetts, massachusetts institute of technology, mit, universities, education","WASHINGTON (AP) — The president of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology said Friday she “cannot support” a White House proposal that asks MIT and eight other universities to adopt President Donald Trump’s political agenda in exchange for favorable access to federal funding. READ MORE: Trump asks 9 colleges to commit to his political agenda for better access to federal money MIT is among the first to express forceful views either in favor of or against an agreement the White House billed as providing “multiple positive benefits,” including “substantial and meaningful federal grants.” Leaders of the University of Texas system said they were honored its flagship university in Austin was invited, but most other campuses have remained silent as they review the document. In a letter to Trump administration officials, MIT President Sally Kornbluth said MIT disagrees with provisions of the proposal, including some that would limit free speech and the university’s independence. She said it’s inconsistent with MIT’s belief that scientific funding should be based on merit alone. “Therefore, with respect, we cannot support the proposed approach to addressing the issues facing higher education,” Kornbluth said in a letter to Education Secretary Linda McMahon and White House officials. The higher education compact circulated last week requires universities to make a wide range of commitments in line with Trump’s political agenda on topics from admissions and women’s sports to free speech and student discipline. The universities were invited to provide “limited, targeted feedback” by Oct. 20 and make a decision no later than Nov. 21. Others that received the 10-page proposal are: Vanderbilt, the University of Pennsylvania, Dartmouth College, the University of Southern California, the University of Arizona, Brown University and the University of Virginia. It was not clear how the schools were selected or why. Colleges have faced mounting pressure to reject the proposal University leaders face immense pressure to reject the compact amid opposition from students, faculty, free speech advocates and higher education groups. Leaders of some other universities have called it extortion. The mayor and city council in Tucson, home of the University of Arizona, formally opposed the compact, calling it an “unacceptable act of federal interference.” Even some conservatives have dismissed the compact as a bad approach. Frederick Hess, director of education policy at the American Enterprise Institute, called it “profoundly problematic” and said the government’s requests are “ungrounded in law.” At the University of Virginia, officials invited campus feedback on the proposal this week. A message from university leaders said it would be “very difficult” to accept certain terms of the arrangement and said the decision will be guided by “principles of academic freedom and free inquiry.” READ MORE: How Trump’s college crackdown is raising concerns about free speech and academic freedom Democrats in the Virginia Senate threatened to cut the university’s funding if it signed the deal. In a letter to the university’s leaders on Tuesday, top Democrats called the compact a trap and said the state would not “subsidize an institution that has ceded its independence to federal political control.” California Gov. Gavin Newsom, a Democrat, issued a similar ultimatum to USC last week. At Brown, which already struck an agreement with the White House in July to resolve a series of investigations, university president Christina H. Paxson said Friday she is seeking campus input to decide how or whether to respond to the new proposal. The compact marks a new tactic to seek reforms In its letter to universities, the administration said the compact would strengthen and renew the “mutually beneficial relationship” between universities and the government. That bond faces unprecedented strain as the White House cuts billions of dollars in research funding from campuses it accuses of antisemitism and liberal bias. The compact is a proactive attempt at reform even as the government continues enforcement through other means, the letter said. The nine universities were invited to become “initial signatories.” Kornbluth’s letter did not explicitly decline the compact but suggested that its terms are unworkable. Still, she said MIT is already aligned with some of the values outlined in the deal, including prioritizing merit in admissions and making college more affordable. RED MORE: Critics say Trump’s push for fairness in college admissions is leaving out legacy preferences Kornbluth said MIT was the first to reinstate requirements for standardized admissions tests after the COVID-19 pandemic and admits students based on their talent, ideas and hard work. Incoming undergraduates whose families earn less than $200,000 a year pay nothing for tuition, she added. “We freely choose these values because they’re right, and we live by them because they support our mission,” Kornbluth wrote. As part of the compact, the White House asked universities to freeze tuition for U.S. students for five years. Those with endowments exceeding $2 million per undergraduate could not charge tuition at all for students pursuing “hard science” programs. It asked colleges to require the SAT or ACT for all undergraduate applicants and to eliminate race, sex and other characteristics from admissions decisions. Schools that sign on would also have to accept the government’s binary definition of gender and apply it to campus bathrooms and sports teams. Much of the compact centers on promoting conservative viewpoints. To make campuses a “vibrant marketplace of ideas” campuses would commit to taking steps including “transforming or abolishing institutional units that purposefully punish, belittle, and even spark violence against conservative ideas.” A free press is a cornerstone of a healthy democracy.

Kennedy, Jr. Thursday reasserted the unproven link between the pain reliever Tylenol and autism , and suggested people who opposed the theory were motivated by hatred for President Donald Trump. During a meeting with Trump and the Cabinet , Kennedy reiterated the connection, even while noting there was no medical proof to substantiate the claim. He also mistakenly described a pregnant woman’s anatomy and linked autism to circumcision. READ MORE: Here’s what we know about the causes of autism “Anybody who takes the stuff during pregnancy unless they have to is, is irresponsible,” Kennedy told Trump and fellow Cabinet members. “It is not proof. We’re doing the studies to make the proof.” Kennedy has long espoused unconventional beliefs about public health, which have prompted concern among medical experts that, as health secretary, he could upend the country’s evidence-based health policies. VIDEO Kennedy noted during the meeting that he had seen a TikTok video on Thursday, which he said featured a pregnant woman “gobbling Tylenol” and cursing Trump. “The level of Trump derangement syndrome has now left the political landscape and now in the realm of pathology,” he said. Kennedy also said the woman was taking Tylenol “with a baby in her placenta.” READ MORE: WHO urges caution on autism and acetaminophen claims, saying several studies ‘found no such relationship’ A fetus develops in the uterus, not the placenta. The placenta is a temporary organ that develops in the uterus during pregnancy and provides oxygen, nutrients, and hormones to the growing fetus. Kennedy’s statement came two weeks after he stood with Trump in the White House as the president used his office to promote unproven and, in some cases, discredited ties between Tylenol, vaccines and autism. Kennedy also said Thursday that infant boys who are circumcised have double the rate of autism because they are given Tylenol after the procedure. READ MORE: 12 ways RFK Jr. has undercut vaccine confidence as health secretary This claim seems to refer to a study in the Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine from 2015, which looked at ritual circumcision and the risk of autism spectrum disorder in boys under the age of 10 in Denmark. It found that those who had undergone the procedure, which involves the removal of the foreskin from the penis, were more likely to develop autism than other boys in the study. Researchers suggested a potential link might be due to the pain of the procedure. Researchers noted that they had no data on painkillers or anesthetics used, and thus couldn’t address whether Tylenol was linked to autism. Other researchers pointed out that the Denmark study looked at correlation, not causation. They also point to other studies that found no evidence to support a link between circumcision and autism.

8e0673273453,Trump threatens more tariffs after China restricts key exports,"china, donald trump news, rare earth minerals, tariffs, xi jinping, world","WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump said Friday that “there seems to be no reason” to meet with Chinese leader Xi Jinping as part of an upcoming trip to South Korea and threatened additional tariffs after China restricted exports of rare earths needed for American industry. The Republican president suggested that he was looking at a “massive increase” of import taxes on Chinese products in response to Xi’s moves. It’s possible that could amount to either posturing by the United States for eventual negotiations or a retaliatory step that could foster new fears about the stability of the global economy. WATCH: Trump considers $10 billion bailout for farmers as tariffs disrupt the market “One of the Policies that we are calculating at this moment is a massive increase of Tariffs on Chinese products coming into the United States of America,” Trump posted on his Truth Social platform. “There are many other countermeasures that are, likewise, under serious consideration.” The United States and China have been jostling for advantage in trade talks, after the import taxes announced earlier this year triggered a trade war between the world’s two largest economies. Both nations agreed to ratchet down tariffs after negotiations in Switzerland and the United Kingdom, yet tensions remain as China has sought to restrict America’s access to the difficult-to-mine rare earth’s needed for a wide array of U.S. technologies. Trump did not formally cancel the meeting with Xi, so much as indicate that it might not happen as part of a trip at the end of the month in Asia. The trip was scheduled to include a stop in Malaysia, which is hosting the Association of Southeast Asian Nations summit; a stop in Japan; and a visit to South Korea, where he was slated to meet with Xi ahead of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit. READ MORE: Trump says he and Xi will meet in South Korea next month and he’ll later go to China “I was to meet President Xi in two weeks, at APEC, in South Korea, but now there seems to be no reason to do so,” Trump posted. China’s new restrictions On Thursday, the Chinese government restricted access to the rare earths ahead of the scheduled Trump-Xi meeting. Beijing would require foreign companies to get special approval for shipping the metallic elements aboard. It also announced permitting requirements on exports of technologies used in the mining, smelting and recycling of rare earths, adding that any export requests for products used in military goods would be rejected. Trump said that China is “becoming very hostile” and that it’s holding the world “captive” by restricting access to the metals and magnets used in electronics, computer chips, lasers, jet engines and other technologies. READ MORE: How critical minerals give China an edge in trade negotiations with U.S. “I have not spoken to President Xi because there was no reason to do so,” Trump posted. “This was a real surprise, not only to me, but to all the Leaders of the Free World.” The Chinese Embassy in Washington did not immediately respond to an Associated Press request for comment. The U.S. president said the move on rare earths was “especially inappropriate” given the announcement of a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas in Gaza so that the remaining hostages from Hamas’ Oct. 7, 2023, attack can be released. He raised the possibility without evidence that China was trying to steal the moment from him for his role in the ceasefire, saying on social media, “I wonder if that timing was coincidental?” Trump’s trade war The outbreak of a tariff-fueled trade war between the U.S. and China initially caused the world economy to shudder over the possibility of global commerce collapsing. Trump imposed tariffs totaling 145% on Chinese goods, with China responding with import taxes of 125% on American products. The taxes were so high as to effectively be a blockade on trade between the countries. That led to negotiations that reduced the tariff charged by the U.S. government to 30% and the rate imposed by China to 10% so that further talks could take place. But differences continue over America’s access to rare earths from China, U.S. restrictions on China’s ability to import advanced computer chips, sales of American-grown soybeans and a series of tit-for-tat port fees being levied by both countries starting on Tuesday. WATCH: China cuts exports of vital rare earth minerals as trade war with U.S. intensifies There is already a backlog of export license applications from Beijing’s previous round of export controls on rare earth elements, and the latest announcements “add further complexity to the global supply chain of rare earth elements,” the European Union Chamber of Commerce in China said in a statement. Just what Trump’s threat meant was open to interpretation, as it could simply be an attempt to gain some leverage under the belief that China has overplayed its hand or an ominous sign of trade tensions leading to potentially destructive increase in tariff rates. How analysts see moves by U.S. and China Cole McFaul, a research fellow at Georgetown University’s Center for Security and Emerging Technology, said that Trump appeared in his post to be readying for talks on the possibility that China had overplayed its hand. By contrast, China sees itself as having come out ahead when the two countries have engaged in talks. “From Beijing’s point of view, they’re in a moment where they’re feeling a lot of confidence about their ability to handle the Trump administration,” McFaul said. “Their impression is they’ve come to the negotiating table and extracted key concessions.” Craig Singleton, senior director of the China program at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, a think tank, said Trump’s post could “mark the beginning of the end of the tariff truce” that had lowered the tax rates charged by both countries. It’s still unclear how Trump intends to follow through on his threats and how China plans to respond. “But the risk is clear: Mutually assured disruption between the two sides is no longer a metaphor,” Singleton said. “Both sides are reaching for their economic weapons at the same time, and neither seems willing to back down.” A free press is a cornerstone of a healthy democracy.

LIVE UPDATES : Hamas frees living hostages, Israel releases prisoners as Trump visits Middle East Although the U.S.-brokered truce between Israel and Hamas remains fragile, Trump is determined to seize an opportunity to chase an elusive regional harmony. “Generations from now, this will be remembered as the moment that everything began to change,” he declared to the Knesset, which welcomed him as a hero.

In an unexpected detour, Trump called on the Israeli president to pardon Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, whom he described as “one of the greatest” wartime leaders. Netanyahu faces corruption charges, although several hearings have been postponed during the conflict with Hamas. Trump pressed Israel to look past the war, saying the country “has won all that they can by force of arms.” “You’ve won.

There was a chance that Netanyahu would join him, and Egypt even announced his attendance. However, Netanyahu’s office said later that he would not be going because the summit was too close to the Jewish holiday of Simchat Torah.

The whirlwind trip, which included a speech at the Knesset in Jerusalem earlier in the day, comes at a fragile moment of hope for ending two years of war between Israel and Hamas. “Everybody said it’s not possible to do.

Photo by Stoyan Nenov/Reuters The moment remains fragile, with Israel and Hamas still in the early stages of implementing the first phase of Trump’s plan. The first phase of the ceasefire agreement calls for the release of the final hostages held by Hamas; the release of hundreds of Palestinian prisoners held by Israel; a surge of humanitarian aid to Gaza; and a partial pullback by Israeli forces from Gaza’s main cities. Trump has said there’s a window to reshape the region and reset long-fraught relations between Israel and its Arab neighbors. “The war is over, OK?” Trump told reporters traveling with him aboard Air Force One. “I think people are tired of it,” he said, emphasizing that he believed the ceasefire would hold because of that.

He said the chance of peace was enabled by his Republican administration’s support of Israel’s decimation of Iranian proxies, including Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon. The White House said momentum is also building because Arab and Muslim states are demonstrating a renewed focus on resolving the broader, decades-long Israeli-Palestinian conflict and, in some cases, deepening relations with the United States. In February, Trump had predicted that Gaza could be redeveloped into what he called “the Riviera of the Middle East.” But on Sunday aboard Air Force One, he was more circumspect.

This is like a demolition site.” But he said he hoped to one day visit the territory. “I’d like to put my feet on it, at least,” he said. The sides have not agreed on Gaza’s postwar governance, the territory’s reconstruction and Israel’s demand that Hamas disarm. Negotiations over those issues could break down, and Israel has hinted it may resume military operations if its demands are not met. Much of Gaza has been reduced to rubble, and the territory’s roughly 2 million residents continue to struggle in desperate conditions. Under the deal, Israel agreed to reopen five border crossings, which will help ease the flow of food and other supplies into Gaza, parts of which are experiencing famine. Roughly 200 U.S. troops will help support and monitor the ceasefire deal as part of a team that includes partner nations, nongovernmental organizations and private-sector players.

b7d7226050ad,Education Department layoffs hit offices that oversee special education and civil rights enforcement,"budget shutdown, donald trump news, education department, politics","WASHINGTON (AP) — A new round of layoffs at the Education Department is depleting an agency that was hit hard in the Trump administration’s previous mass firings, threatening new disruption to the nation’s students and schools in areas from special education to civil rights enforcement and after-school programs. The Trump administration started laying off 466 Education Department staffers on Friday amid mass firings across the government meant to pressure Democratic lawmakers over the federal shutdown. The layoffs would cut the agency’s workforce by nearly a fifth and leave it reduced by more than half its size when President Donald Trump took office on Jan. 20. READ MORE: On 12th day of shutdown, Vance warns new ‘painful’ cuts ahead The cuts play into Trump’s broader plan to shut down the Education Department and parcel its operations to other agencies. Over the summer, the department started handing off its adult education and workforce programs to the Department of Labor, and it previously said it was negotiating an agreement to pass its $1.6 trillion student loan portfolio to the Treasury Department. Department officials have not released details on the layoffs and did not immediately respond to a request for comment. AFGE Local 252, a union that represents more than 2,700 department workers, said information from employees indicates cuts will decimate several offices within the agency. All workers except a small number of top officials are being fired at the office that implements the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, a federal law that ensures millions of students with disabilities get support from their schools, the union said. Unknown numbers are being fired at the Office for Civil Rights, which investigates complaints of discrimination at the nation’s schools and universities. The layoffs would eliminate or heavily deplete teams that oversee the flow of grant funding to schools across the nation, the union said. It hits the office that oversees Title I funding for the country’s low-income schools along with the team that manages 21st Century Community Learning Centers, the primary federal funding source for after-school and summer learning programs. It will also hit an office that oversees TRIO, a set of programs that help low-income students pursue college, and another that oversees federal funding for Historically Black Colleges and Universities. In a statement, union president Rachel Gittleman said the new reductions, on top of previous layoffs, will “double down on the harm to K-12 students, students with disabilities, first generation college students, low-income students, teachers and local education boards.” The Education Department had about 4,100 employees when Trump took office. After the new layoffs, it would be down to fewer than 2,000. Earlier layoffs in March had roughly halved the department, but some employees were hired back after officials decided they had cut too deep. The new layoffs drew condemnation from a range of education organizations. Although states design their own competitions to distribute federal funding for 21st Century Community Learning Centers, the small team of federal officials provided guidance and support “that is absolutely essential,” said Jodi Grant, executive director of the Afterschool Alliance. “Firing that team is shocking, devastating, utterly without any basis, and it threatens to cause lasting harm,” Grant said in a statement. The government’s latest layoffs are being challenged in court by the American Federation of Government Employees and other national labor unions. Their suit, filed in San Francisco, said the government’s budgeting and personnel offices overstepped their authority by ordering agencies to carry out layoffs in response to the shutdown. In a court filing, the Trump administration said the executive branch has wide discretion to reduce the federal workforce. It said the unions could not prove they were harmed by the layoffs because employees would not actually be separated for another 30 to 60 days after receiving notice.

1278766bff02,Some Indigenous Peoples Day events strike conciliatory tone as Trump focuses on Columbus,"indigenous peoples day, nation","From Seattle to Baltimore, many Americans were celebrating Monday as Indigenous Peoples Day, determined to see it as a triumph of perseverance over centuries marked by trauma. Tribal nations and communities gathered at powwows, markets and musical performances among other joyful events to honor their culture and their history. Some states and cities have for decades now made the second Monday in October about honoring Native Americans alongside the Italian explorer Christopher Columbus, for whom the federal holiday was declared in 1937. And President Joe Biden signed a declaration recognizing both days. President Donald Trump, keeping a vow he made in April, reversed that last week , pledging “to reclaim his extraordinary legacy of faith, courage, perseverance, and virtue from the left-wing arsonists who have sought to destroy his name and dishonor his memory.” Trump’s tribute to the explorer whose planting of the Spanish flag in the Caribbean in 1492 opened the Americas to “the ultimate triumph of Western civilization” — along with centuries of disease, slavery and conquest that ravaged Indigenous civilizations — is drawing criticism and resignation from Native Americans. But some advocates say his posture is hardly unique among previous presidents, and they won’t be dissuaded from seeking to build consensus for tribal goals. Indigenous Peoples Day is about inclusion, not exclusion VIDEO Advocates in Montana spoke to PBS News about the state’s first-ever Indigenous Peoples Day celebration. Video by Addy Briley/PBS News This is the first year Indigenous Peoples Day has state recognition in Montana, after a decade-long campaign in the state that is home to 12 federally recognized tribes. What changed? Democratic State Sen. Shane Morigeau, a citizen of the Confederated Salish and Kootenai Tribes who sponsored the legislation, framed it not as a holiday that would eliminate Columbus Day, but as a day of “inclusivity, healing and bringing people together.” “It’s just not an us-versus-them type of day. It’s a day that brings everyone together,” Morigeau said. “And if you don’t want to go check that out and you want to go do something else and celebrate the other day, you can do that too and our feelings won’t be hurt.” What matters is that both Native and non-Native people can go to an event or do some self-reflection or even “go down to the river and go fishing for the day,” Morigeau said. File Photo: Youth hold a banner as they lead a celebratory march for Indigenous Peoples Day in 2023 in Seattle. AP Photo by Lindsey Wasson. After the protests over the Dakota Access Pipeline in 2016 and the racial injustice protests in 2020, more people and institutions questioned the narrative of Columbus as only an intrepid sailor and explorer, arguing for a more complete understanding of his historical impact. Trump’s proclamation lambastes this as the villainizing of a “true American hero.” “Outrageously, in recent years, Christopher Columbus has been a prime target of a vicious and merciless campaign to erase our history, slander our heroes, and attack our heritage,” Trump’s proclamation reads. “Left-wing radicals toppled his statues, vandalized his monuments, tarnished his character, and sought to exile him from our public spaces.” Chase Iron Eyes, director of the Lakota People’s Law Project, said it’s Trump who is making this a culture war, when the day should be about learning all aspects of history around Columbus. “If Trump wants to celebrate the good things about Christopher Columbus then let him. Let him do that. But also tell the truth about him and let us also celebrate Indigenous peoples’ accomplishments,” said Iron Eyes, who is of the Lakota Sioux Nation. “We don’t teach that in America’s schools.” Soldiers at Wounded Knee keeping medals The National Congress of American Indians found it profoundly troubling when Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth announced last month that the soldiers who killed more than 250 men, women and children in the 1890 Wounded Knee Massacre would retain their military honors after a review launched under the Biden administration. Hegseth called it part of his effort to root out “woke” thinking. Iron Eyes, who lives on Pine Ridge, called it hurtful. “We have kids who pay attention,” Iron Eyes said. “When Pete Hegseth is doubling down on wanting to honor people who slaughtered noncombatants and women and children and elderly, the kids are paying attention.” This has only reinvigorated the Lakota People’s Law Project’s campaign to persuade Congress to rescind the Wounded Knee military medals, he said. “We’ve made hard-fought sacrifices to get to a place where we’re saying to each other, ‘Hey, let’s tell the truth about each other,'” Iron Eyes said. “Natives aren’t savage. They’re not impediments to progress. They’re not antithetical to civilization.” Increased funding for Tribal Colleges and Universities In September, Trump’s Education Department redirected nearly $500 million in federal funding from schools serving large contingents of Hispanic students, promising the money instead for historically Black colleges and tribal colleges. This could double federal funding to roughly $108 million across the United States for tribal colleges and universities, or TCUs. “That’s what Indian Country wants, to continue to invest in our tribal citizens and Native people and to be contributors to not only our tribal economies, but to the U.S. economy as a whole,” said Larry Wright Jr., executive director of the National Congress of American Indians. There are 35 accredited TCUS with over 90 campuses across 15 states, most of which are in Indian Country, according to the American Indian Higher Education Consortium. The consortium lauded the funds as “progress toward fulfilling federal trust and treaty obligations” while also noting that it could raise more obstacles for students at non-TCU schools. Many Native Americans are enrolled at the universities that are losing federal funding. Tribal appropriations were initially included in the Trump administration’s efforts to claw back federal spending that it sees as promoting diversity, equity and inclusion. Wright gives credit that the administration heard NCAI officials out and understood “Indian Country is not DEI” — and that there are treaties and trust responsibilities that must be met. He said they’ve had productive conversations with the administration and lawmakers on both sides of the aisle. “To have that kind of alignment with this administration is a good thing in spite of all the other rhetoric.

bfb83309fe9a,North Carolina GOP announce plans to vote on new House map amid nationwide redistricting battle,"congressional midterms, north carolina, re-districting, vote 2026, politics","RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) — North Carolina Republican legislative leaders announced plans Monday to vote next week on redrawing the state’s U.S. House district map, with a likely aim to secure another GOP seat within already right-leaning boundaries. The move comes amid an emerging mid-decade battle nationally between Republicans and Democrats seeking advantage in the way U.S. House districts are drawn in several states for the 2026 session. READ MORE: The fight to redraw U.S. House maps is spreading. Here’s where things stand in Missouri and other states North Carolina Republicans already created a map in 2023 that resulted in GOP candidates winning 10 of the state’s 14 U.S. House seats in 2024. That division compared to the 7-7 seat split between Democrats and the GOP under the map used in 2022. Now only one of the state’s House district’s –- the 1st District currently represented by Democratic Rep. Don Davis –- is considered a swing district and could be targeted by the GOP for an 11th seat. Davis won a second term last year by less than 2 percentage points, so shifting slightly portions of the district covering nearly 20 northeastern counties could help a Republican candidate in a strong GOP year. A news release from the state’s Republican legislators said their planned action “follows President Donald Trump’s call urging legislatures across the country to take action to nullify Democrat redistricting efforts.” Trump kickstarted the redistricting battle this summer by calling upon Republican-led Texas to reshape its U.S. House districts so that the GOP could win more seats in next year’s elections. As Texas redrew its districts to give Republicans a shot at winning five more seats, Democrats in California reciprocated by passing their own redistricting plan aimed at helping Democrats win five additional seats. Then lawmakers in Republican-led Missouri approved revised U.S. House districts intended to help Republicans win an additional seat. The new Texas map faces a legal challenge. The California map still needs voter approval in a Nov. 4 election to take effect. And the Missouri map faces both court challenges and an initiative petition campaign seeking to force a statewide referendum on it. A free press is a cornerstone of a healthy democracy.

bacb4b1c46e8,WATCH: Johnson responds to critics on why he won’t call House back for shutdown negotiations,"government shutdown, healthcare, immigration, mike johnson, politics","WASHINGTON (AP) — Republican Speaker Mike Johnson predicted Monday the federal government shutdown may become the longest in history, saying he “won’t negotiate” with Democrats until they hit pause on their health care demands and reopen. Watch Johnson speak in the player above. Standing alone at the Capitol on the 13th day of the shutdown, the speaker said he was unaware of the details of the thousands of federal workers being fired by the Trump administration. It’s a highly unusual mass layoff widely seen as way to seize on the shutdown to reduce the scope of government. Vice President JD Vance has warned of “painful” cuts ahead, even as employee unions sue. “We’re barreling toward one of the longest shutdowns in American history,” Johnson of Louisiana said. With no endgame in sight, the shutdown is expected to roll on for the unforeseeable future. The closure has halted routine government operations, shuttered Smithsonian museums and other landmark cultural institutions and left airports scrambling with flight disruptions, all injecting more uncertainty into an already precarious economy. The House is out of legislative session, with Johnson refusing to recall lawmakers back to Washington, while the Senate, closed Monday for the federal holiday, will return to work Tuesday. But senators are stuck in a cul-de-sac of failed votes as Democrats refuse to relent on their health care demands. Johnson thanked President Donald Trump for ensuring military personnel are paid this week, which removed one main pressure point that may have pushed the parties to the negotiating table. At its core, the shutdown is a debate over health care policy — and particularly the Affordable Care Act subsidies that are expiring for millions of Americans who rely on government aid to purchase their own health insurance policies on the Obamacare exchanges. Democrats demand the subsidies be extended, Republicans argue the issue can be dealt with later. With Congress and the White House stalemated, some are eyeing the end of the month as the next potential deadline to reopen government. That’s when open enrollment begins, Nov. 1, for the health program at issue, and Americans will face the prospect of skyrocketing insurance premiums. The Kaiser Family Foundation has estimated that monthly costs would double if Congress fails to renew the subsidy payments that expire Dec. 31. It’s also when government workers on monthly pay schedules, including thousands of House aides, will go without paychecks. The health care debate has dogged Congress ever since the Affordable Care Act became law under then-President Barack Obama in 2010. The country went through a 16-day government shutdown during the Obama presidency when Republicans tried to repeal the Affordable Care Act 2013. Trump tried to “repeal and replace” the law, commonly known as Obamacare, during his first term, in 2017, with a Republican majority in the House and Senate. That effort failed when then-Sen. John McCain memorably voted a thumbs down on the plan. With 24 million now enrolled in Obamacare, a record, Johnson said Monday that Republicans are unlikely to go that route again, noting he still has “PTSD” from that botched moment. “Can we completely repeal and replace Obamacare? Many of us are skeptical about that now because the roots are so deep,” Johnson said. The Republican speaker insists his party has been willing to discuss the health care issue with Democrats this fall, before the subsidies expire at the end of the year. But first, he said, Democrats have to agree to reopen the government. The longest shutdown, during Trump’s first term over his demands for funds to build the U.S.-Mexico border wall, ended in 2019 after 35 days. Meanwhile, the Trump administration is exercising vast leeway both to fire workers — drawing complaints from fellow Republicans and lawsuits from employee unions — and to determine who is paid. That means not only military troops but other Trump administration priorities don’t necessarily have to go without pay, thanks to the various other funding sources as well as the billions made available in what’s commonly called Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act that’s now law. The Pentagon said over the weekend it was able to tap $8 billion in unused research and development funds to pay the military personnel. They had risked missed paychecks on Wednesday. But the Education Department is among those being hard hit, disrupting special education, after-school programs and others. “The Administration also could decide to use mandatory funding provided in the 2025 reconciliation act or other sources of mandatory funding to continue activities financed by those direct appropriations at various agencies,” according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. The CBO had cited the Department of Defense, the Department of the Treasury, the Department of Homeland Security, and the Office of Management and Budget as among those that received specific funds under the law. “Some of the funds in DoD’s direct appropriation under the 2025 reconciliation act could be used to pay active-duty personnel during a shutdown, thus reducing the number of excepted workers who would receive delayed compensation,” CBO wrote in a letter responding to questions raised by Sen. Joni Ernst, R-Iowa. A free press is a cornerstone of a healthy democracy. Support trusted journalism and civil dialogue.

d461f9dfab55,LISTEN LIVE: SCOTUS hears redistricting case that could reduce representation for Black voters,"14th amendment, african americans, congress, louisiana, re-districting, supreme court, politics","WASHINGTON (AP) — A Republican attack on a core provision of the Voting Rights Act that is designed to protect racial minorities comes to the Supreme Court this week, more than a decade after the justices knocked out another pillar of the 60-year-old law. The hearing is scheduled to begin on Wednesday, October 15, at 10 a.m. ET. Watch in the player above. In arguments Wednesday, lawyers for Louisiana and the Trump administration will try to persuade the justices to wipe away the state’s second majority Black congressional district and make it much harder, if not impossible, to take account of race in redistricting. “Race-based redistricting is fundamentally contrary to our Constitution,” Louisiana Attorney General Elizabeth Murrill wrote in the state’s Supreme Court filing. A mid-decade battle over congressional redistricting already is playing out across the nation, after President Donald Trump began urging Texas and other Republican-controlled states to redraw their lines to make it easier for the GOP to hold its narrow majority in the House of Representatives. A ruling for Louisiana could intensify that effort and spill over to state legislative and local districts. The conservative-dominated court, which just two years ago ended affirmative action in college admissions, could be receptive. At the center of the legal fight is Chief Justice John Roberts, who has long had the landmark civil rights law in his sights, from his time as a young lawyer in the Reagan-era Justice Department to his current job. “It is a sordid business, this divvying us up by race,” Roberts wrote in a dissenting opinion in 2006 in his first major voting rights case as chief justice. In 2013, Roberts wrote for the majority in gutting the landmark law’s requirement that states and local governments with a history of discrimination, mostly in the South, get approval before making any election-related changes. “Our country has changed, and while any racial discrimination in voting is too much, Congress must ensure that the legislation it passes to remedy that problem speaks to current conditions,” Roberts wrote. The challenged provision relies on current conditions Challenges under the provision known as Section 2 of the voting rights law must be able to show current racially polarized voting and an inability of minority populations to elect candidates of their choosing, among other factors. “Race is still very much a factor in current voting patterns in the state of Louisiana. It’s true in many places in the country,” said Sarah Brannon, deputy director of the American Civil Liberties Union’s Voting Rights Project. The Louisiana case got to this point only after Black voters and civil rights groups sued and won lower court rulings striking down the first congressional map drawn by the state’s GOP-controlled Legislature after the 2020 census. That map created just one Black majority district among six House seats in a state that is one-third Black. Louisiana appealed to the Supreme Court but eventually added a second majority Black district after the justices’ 5-4 ruling in 2023 that found a likely violation of the Voting Rights Act in a similar case over Alabama’s congressional map. Roberts and Justice Brett Kavanaugh joined their three more liberal colleagues in the Alabama outcome. Roberts rejected what he described as “Alabama’s attempt to remake our section 2 jurisprudence anew.” That might have settled things, but a group of white voters complained that race, not politics, was the predominant factor driving the new Louisiana map. A three-judge court agreed, leading to the current high court case. Instead of deciding the case in June, the justices asked the parties to answer a potentially big question: “Whether the state’s intentional creation of a second majority-minority congressional district violates the Fourteenth or Fifteenth Amendments to the U. S. Constitution.” Those amendments, adopted in the aftermath of the Civil War, were intended to bring about political equality for Black Americans and gave Congress the authority to take all necessary steps. Nearly a century later, Congress passed the Voting Rights Act of 1965, called the crown jewel of the civil rights era, to finally put an end to persistent efforts to prevent Black people from voting in the former states of the Confederacy. A second round of arguments is rare at the Supreme Court The call for new arguments sometimes presages a major change by the high court. The Citizens United decision in 2010 that led to dramatic increases in independent spending in U.S. elections came after it was argued a second time. “It does feel to me a little bit like Citizens United in that, if you recall the way Citizens United unfolded, it was initially a narrow First Amendment challenge,” said Donald Verrilli, who served as the Obama administration’s top Supreme Court lawyer and defended the voting rights law in the 2013 case. Among the possible outcomes in the Louisiana case, Verrilli said, is one in which a majority holds that the need for courts to step into redistricting cases, absent intentional discrimination, has essentially expired. Kavanaugh raised the issue briefly two years ago. The Supreme Court has separately washed its hands of partisan gerrymandering claims, in a 2019 opinion that also was written by Roberts. Restricting or eliminating most claims of racial discrimination in federal courts would give state legislatures wide latitude to draw districts, subject only to state constitutional limits. A shift of just one vote from the Alabama case would flip the outcome. With the call for new arguments, Louisiana changed its position and is no longer defending its map. The Trump administration joined on Louisiana’s side. The Justice Department had previously defended the voting rights law under administrations of both major political parties. Rep. Cleo Fields has been here before For four years in the 1990s, Louisiana had a second Black majority district until courts struck it down because it relied too heavily on race. Fields, then a rising star in the state’s Democratic politics, twice won election. He didn’t run again when a new map was put in place and reverted to just one majority Black district in the state. Fields is one of the two Black Democrats who won election to Congress last year in newly drawn districts in Alabama and Louisiana. He again represents the challenged district, described in March by Roberts as “a snake that runs from one end of the state to the other,” picking up Black residents along the way. If that’s so, civil rights lawyer Stuart Naifeh told Roberts, it’s because of slavery, Jim Crow laws and the persistent lack of economic opportunity for Black Louisianans. Fields said the court’s earlier ruling that eliminated federal review of potentially discriminatory voting laws has left few options to protect racial minorities, making the preservation of Section 2 all the more important. They would never win election to Congress, he said, “but for the Voting Rights Act and but for creating majority minority districts.” Associated Press writer Gary Fields contributed to this report.

397251be4765,Uncertainty over the economy and tariffs forces many retailers to be cautious on holiday hiring,"christmas, donald trump news, jobs, shopping, tariffs, economy","NEW YORK (AP) — Uncertainty over the economy and tariffs is forcing retailers to pull back or delay plans to hire seasonal workers who pack orders at distribution centers, serve shoppers at stores and build holiday displays during the most important selling season of the year. American Christmas LLC, which creates elaborate holiday installations for commercial properties such as New York’s Rockefeller Center and Radio City Music Hall, plans to hire 220 temporary workers and is ramping up recruitment nearly two months later than usual, CEO Dan Casterella said. Last year, it took on 300 people during its busy period. READ MORE: Without a new jobs report, U.S. ‘flying blind’ on hiring in an uncertain economy The main reason? The company wants to offset its tariff bill, which Casterella expects to be as big as $1.5 million this year, more than double last year’s $600,000. “The issue is if you overstaff and then you underperform, it’s too late,” Casterella said. “I think everyone’s more mindful now than ever. ” Holiday hiring could fall to 2009 levels Online behemoth Amazon Inc. said Monday it intends to hire 250,000 full-, part-time and seasonal workers for the crucial shopping period, the same level as a year ago. But job placement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas forecasts overall holiday hiring for the last three months of the year will likely fall under 500,000 positions. That’s fewer than last year’s 543,000 level and also marks the smallest seasonal gain in 16 years when retailers hired 495,800 temporary workers, the firm said. Among other companies cutting holiday payrolls: Radial, an e-commerce company that powers deliveries for roughly 120 companies like Lands’ End and Cole Haan and operates 20 fulfillment sites. It plans to hire 6,500 workers, fewer than last year’s 7,000, and is waiting to the last minute to ramp up hiring for some of its clients, chief human resources officer Sabrina Wnorowski, said. Bath & Body Works, based in Reynoldsburg, Ohio, said it plans to hire 32,000 workers, below the 32,700 a year ago. “We saw real strong signals that there’s been a cooling in the labor market, even beyond what our expectations were in the first nine months of the year,” Challenger’s senior vice president Andy Challenger said. Challenger also noted companies are using artificial intelligence bots to replace some workers, particularly those working in call centers. And he’s also seeing companies hiring workers closer to when they need them. Meanwhile, the list of companies staying mum about their specific holiday hiring goals keeps growing. Target Corp., UPS and Macy’s are declining to offer figures, a departure from years past. Holiday hiring: the first clues to what’s in store for spending Retailers’ hiring plans mark the first clues to what’s in store for the U.S. holiday shopping season and come as the U.S. job market has lost momentum this year, partly because Trump’s trade wars have created uncertainty that’s paralyzing managers trying to make hiring decisions. The Labor Department reported in early September that U.S. employers — companies, government agencies and nonprofits — added just 22,000 jobs in August, down from 79,000 in July and well below the 80,000 that economists had expected. The government shutdown, which started Oct. 1 and has delayed the release of economic reports, could worsen the job picture. In an attempt to exert more pressure on Democratic lawmakers as the government shutdown continues, the White House budget office said Friday mass firings of federal workers have started. Analysts will be closely monitoring the shutdown’s impact on spending. For now, many retailers say that consumers, while resilient, are selective. Analysts will also be watching how shoppers will react to price increases as a result of high tariff costs in the next few months, experts said. Given an economic slowdown, holiday spending growth is expected to be smaller than a year ago, according to several forecasts. Mastercard SpendingPulse, which tracks spending across all payment methods including cash, predicts that holiday sales will be up 3.6% from Nov. 1 through Dec. 24. That compares with a 4.1% increase last year. Deloitte Services LP forecasts holiday retail sales to be up between 2.9% to 3.4% from Nov. 1 through Jan. 31. That’s compares with 4.2% last year. And Adobe expects U.S. online sales to hit $253.4 billion from Nov. 1 to Dec. 31, representing a 5.3% growth. That’s smaller than last year’s 8.7% growth. A more flexible approach Companies are increasingly wanting to hire workers closer to when they need them, experts said. “In today’s environment, brands are really looking for us to be agile,” Radial’s Wnorowski said. So for some of its clients, Radial will now be hiring two weeks before Thanksgiving weekend, the traditional start for the season, instead of four weeks before the kickoff. Radial is also training holiday hires faster with new technology that’s simplifying their tasks. It used to take a couple of days to train a worker, but now it only takes a couple of hours, she said. Meanwhile, Target will offer current workers additional hours and then will tap into a separate pool of workers— 43,000— who pick up shifts. The Minneapolis-based company also hires seasonal workers across its nearly 2,000 stores and more than 60 distribution facilities to meet demand, it said. For the past few years, Walmart, the largest private employer, has been offering its workers extra hours available during the holidays, a Walmart spokesperson said, noting it’s worked well and the feedback from customers and workers has been “overwhelmingly positive.” The Bentonville, Arkansas-based retailer said there may be some seasonal hiring on a store-by-store basis, but most locations will dole out those hours to current workers. Economic data blackout could create challenges Waiting until the last minute to hire could mean a mad scramble to find talent, but companies say that with the slowing economy, they don’t anticipate having a hard time. Meanwhile, the temporary halt of the release of economic reports leaves retailers in the dark about sales forecasts and the workers they may need. “Certainly, for our customers not having access to data will put more of a challenge on their ability to forecast,” Wnorowski of Radial said. “But we’ll stay very close to them as we go into peak and we’ll adjust as soon we see things changing.” A free press is a cornerstone of a healthy democracy.

2b6f2107f04e,Speaker says U.S. ‘barreling toward’ prolonged shutdown as ripple effects grow,"donald trump news, government shutdown, mike johnson, politics","Speaker of the House Mike Johnson said today the U.S. is “barreling toward one of the longest shutdowns” in history. That stark warning on the 13th day of the shutdown comes as impacts are starting to ripple across the country, with federal workers facing their first week without a paycheck. White House correspondent Liz Landers reports. Geoff Bennett: The speaker of the House said today the U.S. is barreling toward one of the longest shutdowns in history. That stark warning on this 13th day of the government shutdown comes as effects are already starting to ripple across the country, with federal workers facing their first week without a paycheck. Here with the latest is our White House correspondent, Liz Landers. All right, Liz, so day 13, has there been any movement? Liz Landers: The short answer is no, Geoff. The president did announce over the weekend that he's directing the Pentagon to use — quote — ""all available funds"" to pay the U.S. troops. This is apparently reportedly going to be coming from leftover research and development funds that were left over from last fiscal year. The president talked about this last night on Air Force One. Donald Trump, President of the United States: We're taking care of it. We have got the military paid in full. And we're doing a lot of things. We're ending some programs that we don't want. They happen to be Democrat-sponsored programs. But we're ending some programs that we never wanted. And we're probably not going to allow them to come back. I think they made a mistake. I think they made a big mistake. Liz Landers: You hear the president there blaming Democrats still. That has been the Republican position. Speaker Mike Johnson taking that same position today, continuing to blame Democrats for this shutdown, saying that Leader Schumer is using misleading information right now to the public, and, as you mentioned in the intro, Speaker Johnson saying that we're barreling towards the longest government shutdown in history. If that is the case, that means we will be several more weeks in this government shutdown. We're 13 days into this one. The longest one we have had in U.S. history is 35 days. But I would add though, Geoff, that the speaker has had the House out of session. They're not in session right now. The Senate keeps coming back. They continue to vote on these bills. The majority of Democrats continue to hold the line on health care. They say that they do not want to negotiate until — do not want to reopen the government until there are these negotiations on health care. We heard from Leader Jeffries yesterday saying that Democrats will meet anyone, any time, any place to have those negotiations. As far as we know, that's not happening. Geoff Bennett: Yes, the sticking point remains. Liz Landers: Yes. Geoff Bennett: So let's talk about the impact. What's the impact of all of this and when will more Americans start to feel it? Liz Landers: Well, hundreds of thousands of federal workers are going to start missing their paychecks starting this week. We're also hearing that the Smithsonian, America's museums, are closed now. All 21 of those had closed as of yesterday. And then one of the biggest impacts that we have seen thus far are these reduction in force memos that went out, basically these mass layoffs. The administration had been teasing that this would happen. These went out last Friday to more than 4,000 federal employees. Our colleague Ali Rogin reported over the weekend that more than 1,300 staff at the CDC received some of these notices. And of those 1,300, a few days later, 700 of them had those RIF notices rescinded. So that just gives you, I think, a sense of some of the uncertainty that these federal workers are facing right now. Geoff Bennett: The chaos and confusion. Let's talk while we have you about a new personnel announcement the president made, naming Dan Scavino to lead the White House Office of Personnel Management. Remind us who he is and why this matters. Liz Landers: The president posted this on TRUTH Social yesterday. He announced that Dan Scavino — quote — ""will be responsible for the selection and appointment of almost all positions in government, a very big and important position."" Scavino started in President Trump's orbit as his golf caddy years ago at his golf club. He has remained a trusted adviser to the president. He was handling his social media account during the first Trump administration. And I'm sure you remember that. Scavino, though — somebody basically told me today, a former White House official in the first Trump administration, sort of described it saying that announcing Scavino in this role is making something official that he was already doing in an unofficial capacity, which has been advising the president about personal decisions now for years.

23682675edf2,News outlets including The New York Times and Newsmax say they won’t sign Pentagon rules document,"associated press, department of defense, donald trump news, first amendment, new york times, newsmax, pentagon, pete hegseth, press freedom, politics","News organizations including The New York Times, The Associated Press and the conservative Newsmax television network said Monday they will not sign a Defense Department document about its new press rules, making it likely the Trump administration will evict their reporters from the Pentagon. READ MORE: Trump directs Pentagon to use ‘all available funds’ to pay troops despite shutdown Those outlets say the policy threatens to punish them for routine news gathering protected by the First Amendment. The Washington Post, The Atlantic and Reuters on Monday also publicly joined the group that says it will not be signing. AP confirmed Monday afternoon that it would not sign. “Reuters is bound by its commitment to accurate, impartial and independent news,” the agency said in a statement. “We also steadfastly believe in the press protections afforded by the U.S. Constitution, the unrestricted flow of information and journalism that serves the public interest without fear or favor. The Pentagon’s new restrictions erode these fundamental values.” Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth reacted by posting the Times’ statement on X and adding a hand-waving emoji. His team has said that reporters who don’t acknowledge the policy in writing by Tuesday must turn in badges admitting them to the Pentagon and clear out their workspaces the next day. The new rules bar journalist access to large swaths of the Pentagon without an escort and say Hegseth can revoke press access to reporters who ask anyone in the Defense Department for information — classified or otherwise — that he has not approved for release. Newsmax, whose on-air journalists are generally supportive of President Donald Trump’s administration, said that “we believe the requirements are unnecessary and onerous and hope that the Pentagon will review the matter further.” Chief Pentagon spokesman Sean Parnell said the rules establish “common sense media procedures.” “The policy does not ask for them to agree, just to acknowledge that they understand what our policy is,” Parnell said. “This has caused reporters to have a full blown meltdown, crying victim online. We stand by our policy because it’s what’s best for our troops and the national security of this country.” Hegseth also reposted a question from a follower who asked, “Is this because they can’t roam the Pentagon freely? Do they believe they deserve unrestricted access to a highly classified military installation under the First Amendment?” Hegseth answered, “yes.” Reporters say neither of those assertions is true. Pentagon reporters say signing the statement amounts to admitting that reporting any information that hasn’t been government-approved is harming national security. “That’s simply not true,” said David Schulz, director of Yale University’s Media Freedom & Information Access Clinic. Journalists have said they’ve long worn badges and don’t access classified areas, nor do they report information that risks putting any Americans in harm’s way. “The Pentagon certainly has the right to make its own policies, within the constraints of the law,” the Pentagon Press Association said in a statement on Monday. “There is no need or justification, however, for it to require reporters to affirm their understanding of vague, likely unconstitutional policies as a precondition to reporting from Pentagon facilities.” Noting that taxpayers pay nearly $1 trillion annually to the U.S. military, Times Washington bureau chief Richard Stevenson said “the public has a right to know how the government and military are operating.” Trump has applied pressure on news organizations in several ways, with ABC News and CBS News settling lawsuits related to their coverage. Trump has also filed lawsuits against The New York Times and Wall Street Journal and moved to choke off funding for government-run services like the Voice of America and Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty.

b544289d3489,Supreme Court rejects Alex Jones’ appeal of $1.4 billion defamation judgment in Sandy Hook shooting,"alex jones, infowars, sandy hook, supreme court, nation","WASHINGTON (AP) — The Supreme Court on Tuesday rejected an appeal from conspiracy theorist Alex Jones and left in place the $1.4 billion judgment against him over his description of the 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting as a hoax staged by crisis actors. The Infowars host had argued that a judge was wrong to find him liable for defamation and infliction of emotional distress without holding a trial on the merits of allegations lodged by relatives of victims of the shooting, which killed 20 first graders and six educators in Newtown, Connecticut. WATCH: Jury orders conspiracy theorist Alex Jones to pay Sandy Hook families nearly $1 billion The justices did not comment on their order, which they issued without even asking the families of the Sandy Hook victims to respond to Jones’ appeal. An FBI agent who responded to the shooting also sued. Jones filed for bankruptcy in late 2022, and his lawyers told the justices that the “plaintiffs have no possible hope of collecting” the entire judgment. He is separately appealing a $49 million judgment in a similar defamation lawsuit in Texas after he failed to turn over documents sought by the parents of another Sandy Hook victim. In the Connecticut case, the judge issued a rare default ruling against Jones and his company in late 2021 because of what she called Jones’ repeated failure to abide by court rulings and to turn over certain evidence to the Sandy Hook families. The judge convened a jury to determine how much Jones would owe. The following year, the jury agreed on a $964 million verdict and the judge later tacked on another $473 million in punitive damages against Jones and Free Speech Systems, Infowars’ parent company, which is based in Austin, Texas. In November, the satirical news outlet The Onion was named the winning bidder in an auction to liquidate Infowars’ assets to help pay the defamation judgments. But the bankruptcy judge threw out the auction results , citing problems with the process and The Onion’s bid. The attempt to sell off Infowars’ assets has moved to a Texas state court in Austin. Jones is now appealing a recent order from the court that appointed a receiver to liquidate the assets. Some of Jones’ personal property is also being sold off as part of the bankruptcy case.

611b5bcec14e,WATCH LIVE: Trump meets with Argentina’s Milei as U.S. prepares $20 billion bailout,"argentina, donald trump news, javier milei, politics","BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) — Argentina’s libertarian leader is lavishing praise on Donald Trump ahead of his first White House meeting with the U.S. president on Tuesday. It’s a tactic that has helped transform President Javier Milei ‘s cash-strapped country into one of the Trump administration’s closest allies. Trump and Milei are scheduled to meet at 1:15 p.m. ET. Watch in the player above. The effusive declarations are nothing new for Milei — whose dramatic cuts to state spending and attacks on “woke leftists” have won him a following among U.S. conservatives. “Your commitment to life, freedom and peace has restored hope to the world,” Milei wrote on social media Monday, congratulating the U.S. president on securing a ceasefire deal in Gaza, where a truce is holding after a devastating, two-year Israel-Hamas war. “It is an honor to consider you not only an ally in the defense of those values, but also a dear friend and an example of leadership that inspires all those who believe in freedom,” he said. READ MORE: Argentina’s Milei launches initiative to boost Israel-Latin America ties The Trump-Milei bromance has already paid off for Argentina — most recently, to the tune of a $20 billion bailout. Experts say Milei comes to the White House with two clear objectives. One is to negotiate U.S. tariff exemptions or reductions for Argentine products. The other is to see how the United States will implement a $20 billion currency swap line to prop up Argentina’s peso and replenish its depleted foreign currency reserves ahead of crucial midterm elections later this month. In a crisis, turning to Trump The Trump administration made a highly unusual decision to intervene in Argentina’s currency market after Milei’s party suffered a landslide loss in a local election last month. Along with setbacks in the opposition-dominated Congress, the party’s crushing defeat created a crisis of confidence as voters in Buenos Aires Province registered their frustration with rising unemployment, contracting economic activity and brewing corruption scandals. Alarmed that this could herald the end of popular support for Milei’s free-market program, investors dumped Argentine bonds and sold off the peso. Argentina’s Treasury began hemorrhaging precious dollar reserves at a feverish pace, trying shore up the currency and keep its exchange rate within the trading band set as part of the country’s recent $20 billion deal with the International Monetary Fund. But as the peso continued to slide, Milei grew desperate. He met with Trump on Sept. 23 while in New York City for the United Nations General Assembly. A flurry of back-slapping, hand-shaking and mutual flattery between the two quickly gave way to U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent publicly promising Argentina a lifeline of $20 billion. Markets cheered, and investors breathed a sigh of relief. Timing is everything In the days that followed, Argentine Economy Minister Luis Caputo spent hours in meetings in Washington trying to seal the deal. Reassurance came last Thursday, when Bessent announced that the U.S. would allow Argentina to exchange up to $20 billion worth of pesos for an equal sum in dollars. Saying that the success of Milei’s program was “of systemic importance,” Bessent added that the U.S. Treasury directly purchased an unspecified amount of pesos. For the Trump administration, the timing was awkward as it struggles to manage the optics of bailing out a nine-time serial defaulter in the middle of a U.S. government shutdown that has led to mass layoffs. But for Argentina, it came in the nick of time. Aware of how a weak currency could threaten his flagship achievement of taming inflation and hurt his popularity, Milei hopes to stave off what many economists see as an inescapable currency devaluation until after the the Oct. 26 midterm elections. A devaluation of the peso would likely fuel a resurgence in inflation. “Milei is going to the U.S. in a moment of desperation now,” said Marcelo J. García, political analyst and Director for the Americas at the Horizon Engage political risk consultancy firm. “He needs to recreate market expectations and show that his program can be sustainable,” García added. “The government is trying to win some time to make it to the midterms without major course corrections, like devaluing or floating the peso.” No strings attached Milei was vague when pressed for details on his talks with Trump, expected later on Tuesday. Officials say he would have a two-hour meeting with the U.S. president, followed by a working lunch with other top officials. He was also expected to participate in a ceremony at the White House honoring Charlie Kirk, the prominent right-wing political activist who was fatally shot last month. Milei often crossed paths with Kirk on the speaking circuit of the ascendant global right. “We don’t have a single-issue agenda, but rather a multi-issue agenda,” Milei told El Observador radio in Buenos Aires Monday. “Things that are already finalized will be announced, and things that still need to be finalized will remain pending.” It’s not clear what strings, if any, the Trump administration has attached to the currency swap deal, which Democratic lawmakers and other critics have slammed as an example of Trump rewarding loyalists at the expense of American taxpayers. There has been no word on how Argentina, the IMF’s largest debtor, will end up paying the U.S. back for this $20 billion, which comes on top of IMF’s own loan for the same amount in April. And that one came on top of an earlier IMF loan for $40 billion. Despite all the help, Milei’s government already missed the IMF’s early targets for rebuilding currency reserves. “The U.S. should be concerned that Argentina has had to return for $20 billion so quickly after getting $14 billion upfront from the IMF,” said Brad Setser, a former Treasury official now at the Council on Foreign Relations. “I worry that this may prove to just be a short-term bridge and won’t leave Argentina better equipped” to tackle its problems, he added. But in the radio interview before his flight, Milei was upbeat. He gushed about U.S. support saving Argentina from “the local franchise of 21st-century socialism” and waxed poetic about Argentina’s economic potential. “There will be an avalanche of dollars,” Milei said. “We’ll have dollars pouring out of our ears.” A free press is a cornerstone of a healthy democracy.

311c9b9aee5f,"Pennsylvania man pleads guilty terrorism, arson attack at governor’s mansion while Shapiro’s family slept","arson, cody balmer, josh shapiro, pennsylvania, nation","HARRISBURG, Pa. (AP) — A man who scaled an iron security fence in the middle of the night, eluded police and used beer bottles filled with gasoline to ignite the occupied Pennsylvania governor’s mansion pleaded guilty Tuesday to attempted murder and other charges. Cody Balmer, 38, also entered pleas to terrorism, 22 counts of arson, aggravated arson, burglary, aggravated assault of Gov. Josh Shapiro, 21 counts of reckless endangerment and loitering in the April 13 attack that did millions of dollars in damage to the state-owned brick building. READ MORE: Security review planned for Pennsylvania governor’s official residence after arson attack Under a plea deal, Balmer was sentenced to 25 to 50 years in prison. Shapiro and members of his family had to be awakened and evacuated, but no one was injured. The multiple arson and endangerment charges reflected the number of people in the residence at the time, including the governor’s family, guests and state troopers. The fire was set hours after they celebrated the Jewish holiday of Passover with a Seder in the residence. Prosecutors played video clips that showed Molotov cocktails going off and a figure inside and outside the residence. Judge Deborah Curcillo called the video “horrific” and “very frightening.” Balmer told police he planned to beat Shapiro with a small sledgehammer if he had encountered him after breaking into the building, according to court documents. Balmer turned himself in the next afternoon to face charges of attempted homicide, terrorism, aggravated arson and aggravated assault. Police say Balmer broke in through the southern wing of the residence, into a room often used to entertain crowds and display art. Investigators recovered two broken glass beer bottles containing gasoline. The fire charred walls, tables, buffet serving dishes, plates and a piano. Window panes and brick around doors and windows were also damaged. Shapiro’s Jewish faith and the attack during the Passover weekend raised questions about Balmer’s motivation, but Balmer told The Associated Press in a May letter from jail that had not been a factor in his decision. “He can be Jewish, Muslim, or a purple people eater for all I care and as long as he leaves me and mine alone,” Balmer wrote. He said in a brief June 9 video interview from Camp Hill State Prison that he did think beforehand about whether children might be injured. “Does anyone ever consider children?” Balmer said in June. “It doesn’t seem that way. I sure as hell did. I’m glad no one got hurt.” Asked why he felt Shapiro had somehow done him wrong, Balmer replied: “I’m not going to answer that.” Balmer’s mother said days after his arrest that she had tried to get him assistance for mental health issues, but “nobody would help.” Court proceedings had been delayed while he received mental health treatment, his lawyer has said. At a court hearing a few days after the fire, Balmer told a judge he was an unemployed welder with no income or savings and “a lot of children.” The residence, built in 1968, did not have sprinklers.

96ce17a8bb44,Maine Democratic Gov. Mills plans to confront President Trump again with her campaign for Senate,"janet mills, maine, susan collins, vote 2026, politics","PORTLAND, Maine (AP) — The New England governor who told President Donald Trump to his face that she would see him in court now plans to challenge Maine’s Republican U.S. senator at the ballot box. WATCH: Bondi announces lawsuit against Maine over transgender athletes playing in girls sports Democratic Gov. Janet Mills cited her White House confrontation with the Republican president in February as proof that she should serve in the Senate, a bid she formally announced with a campaign launch video Tuesday. “I’ll stand up to Trump, just as I did in February,” Mills said in a telephone interview previewing her campaign with The Associated Press on Sunday. Mills’ comment referred to Maine’s legal challenge to Trump’s executive order barring transgender athletes from school sports. She publicly resisted pressure from the president during an audience with him and other governors in February. Mills says she’s running to help mount a broader resistance to Trump, who she complained has cut food and health care aid for children and low-income Americans in the enormous tax breaks and spending cuts bill enacted in July. She said she’s also running to oust five-term Republican Sen. Susan Collins, who voted for the measure. “I think the moment demands a lot more than we’re seeing from Susan Collins,” Mills said in the interview. “It demands a fighter and someone who will stand up and fight for the future of democracy and fight for the interests of Maine people, just as I have done for my entire career.” Democrats target Maine in 2026 Democrats face an uphill challenge in their effort to retake the majority in the Senate in next year’s midterm congressional elections. The party would need to gain a net of four seats, while Trump carried most of the states holding Senate elections next year. National Democrats see Maine as an important target. It is in the only place on the 2026 Senate election map where Republicans are defending a seat in a state carried last year by Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris. Mills ticked through a list of former Maine senators “who have a proud tradition of defending democracy against those who threatened it,” including Margaret Chase Smith, William Cohen, George Mitchell and Olympia Snowe. Smith, Cohen and Snowe served as Republicans, while Mitchell was a Democrat, though all were known to have crossed party lines. Collins has long cast herself as a reflection of Maine’s independent spirit but has frequently voted with Trump on key issues. “I see Susan Collins as failing to live up to that legacy and failing to meet this unprecedented moment with the strength and courage that it demands,” Mills said. Though Collins voted to convict Trump after his 2021 impeachment over his role in the Jan. 6 Capitol riot, Mills points specifically to her vote to confirm Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh as pivotal to the court’s 2022 decision to overturn the 1973 landmark Roe v. Wade case, which handed decisions about whether abortion should be legal back to the states. Mills also faults Collins for voting to confirm Robert F. Kennedy Jr. as Trump’s choice to be secretary of Health and Human Services. While Kennedy has espoused anti-vaccine policy and ousted public health officials at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Mills said, “I’m taking action with other states to expand vaccines, for instance, and preserve our public health infrastructure.” READ MORE: These states are taking steps to ease access to COVID-19 vaccines Republicans were ready for Mills’ entry into the race with their own video Tuesday. The National Republican Senatorial Committee accused her, among other things, of defying the Trump administration’s push for mass deportations of people in the country illegally and its executive order barring transgender athletes from school sports. “No, thanks, Janet,” the ad concludes. Maine GOP Chairman Jim Deyermond said in a Tuesday statement that Mills is a handpicked choice of Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, who he said is “getting one of America’s most liberal, unpopular Governors to join a race where moderates have had historic success.” Mills promotes transgender fight with Trump But Mills’ campaign sees the fight over transgender rights as a strength. Speaking to a group of governors in the State Dining Room, Trump called out the Maine governor, asking her “are you not going to comply” with the executive order on transgender athletes, to which Mills replied, “I’m complying with state and federal law.” “You better comply because otherwise you’re not getting any, any federal funding,” Trump responded. Mills answered, “ I’ll see you in court .” “Good. I’ll see you in court. I look forward to that. That should be a real easy one,” Trump shot back. “And enjoy your life after governor, because I don’t think you’ll be in elected politics.” Mills stoked Democratic enthusiasm in April when she said of the lawsuit Maine had filed against the Trump administration, “I’ve spent the better part of my career listening to loud men talk tough to disguise their weaknesses.” In May, the Trump administration agreed to reverse its decision to freeze federal money intended for a state child nutrition program over the state’s policy on transgender athletes. Spring ambivalence turns to autumn entry Mills is barred by law from seeking a third term as governor. Throughout the spring and summer, she seemed to dismiss suggestions that she run for Collins’ Senate seat. A few other challengers have declared candidacies for the Democratic nomination, including oyster farmer Graham Platner, who has launched an aggressive social media campaign. Platner has the backing of Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, an independent who caucuses with Democrats. Mills points to the Republican-backed bill and its Medicaid cuts, a partial shutdown of the federal government entering its third week and still-high inflation as some of the reasons that ultimately compelled her to run. “The idea of being in D.C. for me is not something that’s fun,” she told the AP. “But the moment demands it.” A free press is a cornerstone of a healthy democracy.

d1b6fe306d6e,WATCH LIVE: Senate gavels in as Johnson warns this shutdown could be longest in U.S. history,"budget, chuck schumer, federal shutdown, healthcare, mike johnson, senate, politics","WASHINGTON (AP) — Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson predicted Monday the federal government shutdown may become the longest in history, saying he “won’t negotiate” with Democrats until they hit pause on their health care demands and reopen. The Senate is scheduled to begin at 3 p.m. ET. Watch in the player above. Standing alone at the Capitol on the 13th day of the shutdown, the speaker said he was unaware of the details of the thousands of federal workers being fired by the Trump administration. It’s a highly unusual mass layoff widely seen as way to seize on the shutdown to reduce the scope of government. Vice President JD Vance has warned of “painful” cuts ahead, even as employee unions sue. “We’re barreling toward one of the longest shutdowns in American history,” Johnson of Louisiana said. With no endgame in sight, the shutdown is expected to roll on for the unforeseeable future. The closure has halted routine government operations, shuttered Smithsonian museums and other landmark cultural institutions and left airports scrambling with flight disruptions, all injecting more uncertainty into an already precarious economy. The House is out of legislative session, with Johnson refusing to recall lawmakers back to Washington, while the Senate, closed Monday for the federal holiday, will return to work Tuesday. But senators are stuck in a cul-de-sac of failed votes as Democrats refuse to relent on their health care demands. Johnson thanked President Donald Trump for ensuring military personnel are paid this week, which removed one main pressure point that may have pushed the parties to the negotiating table. The Coast Guard is also receiving pay, a senior administration official confirmed Monday. The official insisted on anonymity to discuss plans that have yet to be formally rolled out. At its core, the shutdown is a debate over health care policy — particularly the Affordable Care Act subsidies that are expiring for millions of Americans who rely on government aid to purchase their own health insurance policies on the Obamacare exchanges. Democrats demand the subsidies be extended, but Republicans argue the issue can be dealt with later. House Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries said with Republicans having essentially shut down the chamber now for a fourth week, no real negotiations are underway. They’re “nowhere to be found,” he said on MSNBC. With Congress and the White House stalemated, some are eyeing the end of the month as the next potential deadline to reopen government. Open enrollment begins Nov. 1 for the health program at issue, and Americans will face the prospect of skyrocketing insurance premiums. The Kaiser Family Foundation has estimated that monthly costs would double if Congress fails to renew the subsidy payments that expire Dec. 31. At the end of October, government workers on monthly pay schedules, including thousands of House aides, will go without paychecks. A persistent issue The health care debate has dogged Congress ever since the Affordable Care Act became law under then-President Barack Obama in 2010. The country went through a 16-day government shutdown during the Obama presidency when Republicans tried to repeal the Affordable Care Act in 2013. Trump tried to “repeal and replace” the law, commonly known as Obamacare, during his first term, in 2017, with a Republican majority in the House and Senate. That effort failed when then-Sen. John McCain memorably voted thumbs-down on the plan. With 24 million now enrolled in Obamacare, a record, Johnson said Monday that Republicans are unlikely to go that route again, noting he still has “PTSD” from that botched moment. “Can we completely repeal and replace Obamacare? Many of us are skeptical about that now because the roots are so deep,” Johnson said. The Republican speaker insists his party has been willing to discuss the health care issue with Democrats this fall, before the subsidies expire at the end of the year. But first, he said, Democrats have to agree to reopen the government. The longest shutdown, during Trump’s first term over his demands for funds to build the U.S.-Mexico border wall, ended in 2019 after 35 days. Meanwhile, the Trump administration is exercising vast leeway both to fire workers — drawing complaints from fellow Republicans and lawsuits from employee unions — and to determine who is paid. That means not only military troops but other Trump administration priorities don’t necessarily have to go without pay, thanks to the various other funding sources as well as the billions made available in Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which is now law. The Pentagon said over the weekend it was able to tap $8 billion in unused research and development funds to pay the military personnel. They had risked missed paychecks on Wednesday. But the Education Department is among those being hard hit, disrupting special education, after-school programs and others. “The Administration also could decide to use mandatory funding provided in the 2025 reconciliation act or other sources of mandatory funding to continue activities financed by those direct appropriations at various agencies,” according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. The CBO had cited the departments of Defense, Treasury and Homeland Security and the Office of Management and Budget as among those that received specific funds under the law. “Some of the funds in DoD’s direct appropriation under the 2025 reconciliation act could be used to pay active-duty personnel during a shutdown, thus reducing the number of excepted workers who would receive delayed compensation,” CBO wrote in a letter responding to questions raised by Sen. Joni Ernst, R-Iowa. Associated Press writer Josh Boak contributed to this report. A free press is a cornerstone of a healthy democracy. Support trusted journalism and civil dialogue.

The event is scheduled to begin at 4 p.m. EDT. Watch in the player above. Kirk, who would have turned 32 on Oct. 14, was shot and killed last month by a gunman at Utah Valley University.

At a public memorial service in Glendale, Arizona , Trump called Kirk a “martyr” for America’s freedom and vowed that history would not forget him. Kirk was a friend and ally to Trump, and his assassination inspired grief — and backlash — among his supporters. Vice President JD Vance suggested people call out others who celebrated the controversial influencer’s death, including by informing their employers. ABC late-night talk show host Jimmy Kimmel was temporarily suspended from the air after the network was threatened by a Trump appointee over comments related to the shooting.
